15039	22550	Obviously, any provider has that right and the power to cut off shitty behavior is important, but there are too many times where that collides with shitty buyers but legitimate sellers.
22751	27438	I don't have a concise summary or witty detail to add, just that it's an evergreen situation and always frustrating.
27578	29401	I'm back to my Summer Closet Studio series.
29541	34408	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34508	36872	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
38793	45580	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45600	49345	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again.
49725	55672	Tonight, July the 20th of 2025, episode number 1055 of our show.
55692	59075	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week with my co-hosts.
59095	61738	First off, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61758	62119	Hi, Jamie.
63100	63240	Hi.
64161	65022	How are you doing?
65102	65222	Hello.
66367	67589	I'm really pooped.
67790	70896	Yeah, you had a long day yesterday.
71036	73260	I did, but good things happened.
73561	75465	I'm going to circle back and talk about that in a minute.
75885	78210	That's why I just said good things happened.
78250	78611	That's right.
78651	82498	Let me circle back and say hello to Techmaster Loki as well.
82518	82779	Hello.
82999	83360	Hi, Loki.
83380	83901	How are you doing?
84903	85344	Doing pretty good.
85444	87548	I saw you live streaming some Minecraft yesterday.
88237	106482	Thank you for watching!
106462	112413	Yeah, well, still, I was like, I saw you fighting some gelatinous cube, and I was like, I don't remember that being a Minecraft mob.
112453	114136	And you're going to be like, that's been in the game for five years.
114156	114897	Oh, it's been there forever.
114978	115719	I know, right?
115739	116641	But it's like, I don't know.
116661	118324	I'll show you the last time I actually played Minecraft.
118344	122111	I think that was there when the Xbox 360 version was out, maybe.
122471	122832	What?
123052	123914	I don't remember it.
124074	126158	Maybe I just never saw it for some reason.
126138	142965	um so i just want to give a little disclaimer i've been having technical challenges all day long so a recent windows update screwed up my sound settings and i thought it was obs the you know software we use to push out orange launch radio which just about everybody uses on twitch i mean i'm
142945	148193	There's a couple other, you know, fringe broadcast programs, but most people use OBS at this point.
148213	150437	And I thought it was OBS was the issue.
150877	153061	And so I did a complete reinstall of OBS.
153081	159531	And in the process, I've screwed a lot of things up, including some of our sound related issues, which some of our live listeners are well aware of.
159871	165199	And so we had a little bit of a false start tonight, but I'm hoping everything turns out A-OK with the podcast feed.
166061	168465	You live, you learn, and sometimes you got to improvise.
168485	170067	And the good old saying goes,
170047	180006	Probably the one good thing that Bill O'Reilly brought this world was that clip where you see him going, fuck it, we'll do it live, fuck it.
180577	187065	That clip lives rent-free in my head because it's so good and really is a mantra for how we run this program.
187486	188367	So great.
188807	189088	All right.
190309	195876	Speaking of doing things live, DarkSakura, I want to go back to you because you had a fun little weekend.
196557	198940	How was – A Saturday at least.
199060	202885	How was this little – well, enough fun for an entire weekend in one day.
202905	205509	How was California Extreme?
205809	205909	Yeah.
206800	208363	It was big.
208644	213354	I don't think I did as much this year as I did before, but I had a good time anyway.
214637	221752	Mostly met back up with a lot of the vendors who I make friends with every year, just talking classic games and stuff.
222374	222514	Mm-hmm.
222494	235472	And another person that I need to talk to you about later, so I'm not going to spoil who, was also in the Guinness Book of World Records, the same one we were in.
235512	236453	You texted me about this.
236493	236934	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
237675	238756	Yes.
238776	240659	And saw us.
240839	242081	It's like, hey, I know her.
243503	245125	I was like, yeah, it's a 15-year-old picture.
246106	247088	Really?
247889	249110	Recognized you from the picture?
249431	249531	Yeah.
250591	251114	That's wild.
251134	254914	Yeah, because I see him every year at California Expo.
254934	255718	Oh, because you see him every year.
255758	256281	Okay, I got it.
256301	257125	I got it.
257240	284327	and then I bought YY World for Famicom it's the only game I bought this year I got some doodads and I have Anton who runs one of the shops that's usually out in the hallway gave me something that is disturbing and I love it because of how disturbing it is
284307	291196	It's a Tekken 3 Heihachi Mishima trophy, like the same one in Tekken 3.
291977	293059	It looks very disturbing.
293079	295802	It's also a coin bank, and he just gave it to me.
295822	296984	I'm like, okay, cool, thank you.
297304	298426	And then I bought a Chain Chomp.
300689	306456	But I also bought an Omni Blade from Mass Effect 3.
306857	306957	Okay.
307747	309790	I literally thought you already had one.
309951	312274	And that's why you're like, oh, this is my cosplay today.
312414	313456	I literally thought you already had one.
314838	317603	No, he was also selling a helmet.
317723	321128	And I was like, if you don't sell it at the convention, talk to me and we'll try to work something out.
321709	324454	But I sent you a picture of me wearing it.
324714	328540	And he had one of the light up visors, which I thought was really cool.
328520	332428	Maybe there'll be a Shepard cosplay in the future.
333831	337057	If I can have time and help making all that armor.
338540	341647	Maybe I'll just run around in the hoodie with the Omniblade.
342508	344272	Go, hey, Commander Shepard.
345875	348080	Go, Shepard.
348140	350224	Well, no, just running around the Normandy.
351217	353460	I'm Norma D. Shepard.
353920	355502	I caught some fun pictures.
355762	357404	I know you weren't the only person there.
357865	365754	Over on our Discord server, over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, if you want to chat with us throughout the week, we have a channel for conventions and pictures at conventions and meetup and stuff.
366115	375686	Bobby and I always light up that channel during DragonCon, but I'm glad to see it getting other use too, because I saw Rin Mari, one of our listeners, was posting a lot from California Stream, and I was happy to see that.
375706	377308	Which I was going to be bringing up.
377288	397423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
401032	402834	I was like, is your name Lorenzo?
403655	404497	No.
405157	405518	I know.
405658	407080	I'm just going to call you Chuck.
407100	407741	No!
409343	410424	We were having a fun time.
410564	412026	I was going to say, she's not so little.
412227	413789	I blinked and she was like seven.
414469	415471	She's in second grade.
416052	417954	I'm wild to me.
417974	420978	I mean, she's a cutie.
421318	421619	Oh, I know.
421639	423621	She's adorable.
423641	427266	But I also ran into Wendell at the sushi restaurant that we went to.
427426	427987	Oh, fuck.
428007	429469	That's a blast from the past.
429753	432997	Yeah, I'm really, I was so happy to see him.
433938	435320	It's been years since I saw Wendell.
435761	440127	And I also met up, spoke with a couple of his buddies there.
441028	444653	With something else, we might want to have a little bit of an interview slash exchange.
444753	446014	I will approach that with you later.
446455	447877	Okay.
448838	451802	But, you know, I honestly didn't play as much as I normally do.
452843	455727	You know, I played that Soda game.
456196	479115	Root Beer Tapper Baja Blast Tapper
479872	480152	No.
483056	485479	Called like Soda something.
485519	487101	Taco Bell Cantina Chapper?
488302	488723	No.
488743	491226	You can now have your weddings there?
492708	493288	No, no.
493469	494570	Stop.
496352	500517	I'm trying to remember and it's kind of frustrating when I can't think of the name.
501559	502740	I thought I took a picture of it.
503125	505108	Well, go ahead.
505409	506891	Anyway, it was pretty fun.
508253	510837	I played a little bit of it.
512159	519531	And then it's sort of like the cups appear under a fountain, you know, nozzle.
519511	545907	and you have to pull the right lever to fill the cup without overfilling it and it gets challenging later on people will put ice in other people's cups but you're just having to serve drinks the whole time and it is based off of a bar version relatively newer game and this was a test for a ticket spitter version for arcades it was pretty fun let's collect soda soda blast
547912	549473	Soda Slam, something like that.
552036	557601	But I was just on the verge of remembering the name and then didn't.
558181	562746	But, you know, I played like Venture and the Parappa Arcade Machine.
564247	567710	Does it have like neon taps on it or something?
568151	569392	Yeah, yes.
569872	572595	Yeah, it's Soda Slam.
573115	574436	Soda Slam, super deluxe.
575477	576298	That was the one.
577612	600767	WPC Games are getting old and so are we
601658	602621	It was very fun.
604125	606010	It looks like... What is that game?
606110	607695	Overcooked?
607775	610182	It looks like that meets Tapper.
611245	612288	That's kind of what it looks like to me.
613090	613491	Anyway.
613640	615562	It's pretty fun.
615903	620287	The original inspiration was off of Tapper.
621168	621649	Back in the day.
621709	623711	For the bar version.
624312	629938	There was some old computers too.
630038	636746	There was a first edition iMac CRT.
637166	638568	There's also a Maker's Fair.
638588	642432	I got Salami.
643660	648147	and Chocolate and some Rhubarb Jam and that made me happy.
649469	652253	I just played a few things there and there.
652293	658243	They had their Wizards of War Why did I say Wizards of War?
658283	662149	It's Warlords for dollars competition that they do every year.
662169	664993	I think Dan won $4.
664973	694592	and really it was just a lot of wandering and talking with people and you know networking a bit I got the person that I got the Astarion and the get along shirt for Lizelle and Shadowheart the little pin the badge tokens things I can't remember charms thank you I have a Jeff one Jeff the Shark
696884	720293	and so I have a bigger one of those that's supposed to be a scrunchie holder and um looked through like some old PC games like I wanted it just for the nostalgia even though I really don't have a way to run it but it was Super Tetris by Spectrum Holobyte for the Mac 2 I just would have put that on my desk at work um and um
721589	732125	I also taught someone how to use the peroxide and UV lights to clean up Nintendo bodies.
734048	739156	So it was sort of just a little bit more educational.
739176	740458	And then I got punched.
742868	743849	That's not good.
743869	745311	Oh, I also played Dance Maniacs.
745331	746132	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
746152	747493	Go back to the part where you got punched.
747613	748875	What happened?
749696	758346	So, one of the pinball group's guys, he was very, very, very, very drunk.
759207	759547	That's no excuse.
759567	765754	And we were going to hug another friend at the same time, and he just went wild with an arm and clocked me out.
765734	790240	so like an accidental like crossing of the streams except it was arms but it was pretty direct feeling is what the problem was I mean I'm not gonna say anything about it but I have been punched in the jaw before um and this is what that felt like but I knew it wasn't deliberate so I'm just kind of laughing about it so you know a few days ago I get hit by a car and this time I get clocked in the jaw you should so you should stay home for a few days
792295	793939	Just saying.
795163	799475	I was just like... Don't call into work sick.
799695	802884	Call into work cursed.
802904	804769	Say, I'm cursed right now.
805964	812574	I've been hit by a car and punched and these things come in threes, so I can't come into work because I'm cursed.
812614	814738	That means I would just be delaying the inevitable.
815859	822189	Then it would be like my roof would fall down, which would also not just mean I'm injured, but I'd have to get a new roof.
822350	822951	That's not good.
824533	826436	And then Midna, something might happen to Midna.
827438	828519	I don't want that to happen.
828539	829581	Midna's my boo.
829921	830362	No, we don't.
831604	832866	Yeah, but...
833842	836306	But I had really good sushi, though.
836326	837067	It was really good.
841433	845560	I mean, it was just nice to see people.
846321	850807	Got to hang out with friends and see people.
851028	857217	And I had a beer, a beer, because that was the only way I could deal with certain things going on.
859019	863224	I get that whole like seeing people is really the highlight of the convention.
863264	880362	Like, you know, having just gone to Southern Fried, what, like four or five weeks ago, whenever it was, I feel like half of the great stuff of that convention was getting to see a lot of my Dragon Con people a little bit early, you know, and it's nice to see sort of like, you know, those people I only get to see a couple times a year, if that.
880622	881824	So that's always nice.
881844	882744	I play Dance Maniacs.
883525	884166	It's fun.
885007	886971	So I had some biscuit time.
888814	890979	Alright, we'll get into more games.
890999	892963	The person that does the shooter games wasn't there.
893423	894005	Oh, that's too bad.
895127	898473	Yeah, so there were a couple of shooters, but nothing I was interested in playing.
898634	905567	A few different games that I don't normally see there were around, and of course they had the game that shall not be named, the pinball that shall not be named.
905828	905968	Mm-hmm.
906742	917933	yeah they had it at Southern Fried too in big old lines but Steve Ritchie was there this year took people away from the other pinball machines I wanted to play so it's fine yeah but yeah
918672	924158	Alright, well I'm sure we'll hear a little bit more in your gaming week, but we want to get into some gaming headlines.
924178	925979	That was my gaming week, so there you go.
926820	929723	Well let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
929803	945439	So Loki, you want to tell us a little bit about a big change in gaming media and TV sports, Xbox, and the entire Xbox One launch presentation is kind of feeling a little dated at this point, isn't it?
945942	955291	Yeah, unfortunately, at this point, you know, Xbox isn't going to be about games, TV, TV, TV, sports, TV anymore, and movies.
955813	957538	It's just going to be about games.
958379	960682	TV, and movies.
960762	962324	That content is going away.
963546	964588	Or at least has gone away.
964608	973860	Apparently, July 18th, Xbox posted an FAQ confirming that it was done selling movies and TV episodes on its digital storefront.
974301	978327	Basically saying, Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content.
979228	981731	That is pretty blatant.
982953	983053	Um...
983337	1005818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1006827	1035315	yeah of course the question is that like with them not selling it does that mean that people that bought content are they gonna retain that content or are they just gonna pull a Sony and be like oh no the rights we didn't negotiate them this long bye bye you spent all that money bye bye it's gone you don't own it it's a license to view it I don't know I you know like
1036612	1051176	I had a lot of positive, like, you know, I would have given Microsoft in the past the benefit of the doubt, but considering the actions within the last couple years, yeah, I don't know anymore.
1051196	1052838	Hopefully you'll be able to view that stuff.
1053019	1054401	Honestly, like...
1054499	1057503	Maybe don't build digital libraries on these consoles?
1057583	1059466	You're going to still have access to everything.
1059586	1060107	It's out there.
1060287	1062110	Anything you bought, you can still access.
1062150	1063852	It's just that they're not selling the new stuff.
1064834	1066736	It's in their FAQ.
1067037	1069180	It's also reasonable to think.
1069200	1072204	I think it is reasonable to jump to the conclusion of...
1072184	1078157	Yes, I can still access things through the server, but one day will they decide to pull the server?
1078317	1083068	And I only say Nintendo with 3DS and other things has set that precedent.
1083088	1088219	We've seen other, which is I think the slippery slope that makes people avoid digital in the first place.
1088279	1090564	Now, Microsoft being a bigger company,
1090544	1094991	You know, if Microsoft were to ever disappear, that would be quite the change.
1095011	1096553	I'm not saying it'll never happen.
1096634	1100099	I mean, you know, Sega completely pivoted from what they were.
1100119	1108092	Or you have huge, you know, legacy companies that were huge at one point in the lives and now, you know, not even what they used to be.
1108653	1110415	You know, so I'm not going to say it's never, ever going to happen.
1110435	1116785	But I think it's certainly reasonable to say that someday, you know, that content is not going to be there.
1116846	1118408	But that's why...
1118506	1121110	Some people are shying away from digital in the first place.
1124195	1134051	And I see Bobby in chat says, a lot of people hated Xbox being about TV sports movies, and now people are hating that Xbox is no longer about TV sports movies.
1134031	1143662	I'm not bothered that they closed this because I wasn't using it, and I completely recognize that if people aren't using something, it's going to go away.
1143682	1159060	Now I know, because I saw the chat during Bobby's show, and I think we have an email later in the show, I know there are people that were using it that are a lot more directly impacted by this, because if you were putting your stock in buying things in the Xbox shop, and then suddenly it goes away...
1159040	1174146	even if the servers are staying up you now have to have one collection over here and another collection over here and it's going to be tempting to just buy the stuff you already bought over here to have it over here in this pile and that gets really ridiculous at some point, right?
1174126	1188207	So as much as I personally am not really feeling any sort of strong feeling about this announcement, I do think Microsoft fumbled the bag in the fact that they never got people to use this marketplace more.
1188608	1193876	And I wonder if this is just something that Sony is going to fall for at some point too.
1194557	1198142	And the reason why I say this, I mentioned –
1198122	1201045	I remember bringing this up a long time ago.
1201065	1201526	Yeah, they did.
1202226	1204629	Oh, did Sony stop selling movies and stuff too?
1204789	1205450	See, I don't even know.
1205470	1206291	Oh, no, no, no, no.
1206431	1210896	I was thinking of more the Discovery stuff that got pulled.
1211056	1215821	So they are selling stuff, but then that license expired.
1215962	1218785	And then instead of like, well, you just can't buy the content anymore.
1219205	1221868	They're like, no, you can't view the content anymore.
1222017	1232215	Well, here's the thing is that Sony, especially in their case, they not only own a very large gaming console company, but they also own a movie studio.
1232275	1234960	I think you all are well aware about Sony Pictures, right?
1234980	1236122	You know about that.
1236142	1239267	So with that...
1239415	1256732	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1256712	1274738	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
1274718	1278643	So in that case, it was an agreement between Microsoft and Paramount+.
1279144	1290680	But in Sony's case, you would think that they would give away some Sony sci-fi movies that didn't make much money and probably are sold for pennies to Basic Cable at this point.
1290700	1302857	You'd think they would throw some of those into PlayStation Plus to try to sweeten the deal and most of all, lure people to that spot to start to build their online collection and so they have to use that.
1302877	1303358	Like, for...
1303338	1309213	I would have zero reason to use the Epic Game Store if it wasn't for the free game collection.
1309835	1318970	There's other things like that that lure people to these places to get them to make it a part of what they check, their hobby, and all that stuff.
1319270	1337479	I'm shocked that for all the talk of TV, movie, sport, TV, movie, sports, Microsoft didn't try to push people more into those places to get them to try to stay there and instead open themselves up to these partnerships with Paramount+, Netflix,
1337459	1344650	I almost said Traders, but that's Peacock, which the Traders is on, and all those other streaming services.
1344670	1349757	We all know there's a million of them, and they sort of lost to themselves in that regard.
1349837	1355405	People are going to the streaming services instead, or even if it's a buy-to-own situation, they go to what?
1355466	1356447	Plex?
1356427	1358891	I don't know, so actually Plex is a Sony product.
1358951	1362096	So maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm off base with my read on that one.
1362617	1366583	But, you know, there isn't really a Microsoft type of streaming service or anything.
1366603	1372012	So it's just at some point they decided they weren't really going to go all in on that game.
1372313	1374957	That's what it really ended up being.
1374977	1377000	So, yeah.
1378077	1379098	I don't know.
1379118	1385728	It's sad for the people that used it, but I think Microsoft just wrote this off a long time ago.
1385828	1388311	They decided to go all in with Game Pass.
1389173	1400629	But I'm just very curious why they didn't try to have an Entertainment Pass that would have Game Pass plus a Paramount Plus subscription deal, right?
1400809	1403713	I've been saying for the longest time, like...
1403693	1405896	Steam needs to get in on that.
1405916	1427305	Can you imagine like people that impulse buyouts like start releasing like these or like even like Hubbubunnel or something like if movies were on Steam and you had all this stuff imagine like just buying like you have the Neil Breen stuff you can have like all these obscure movies that are essentially worthless they're not on any of these streaming services and hell probably a lot of them are on these like free streaming
1427285	1453798	services that are built into different things but people would probably pay money to like add that to their collection just at the very least to just collect that stuff and so they have it like I just it feels like money being left on the table there uh Bobby Blackwolf says drop out tv even that's great get something that caters to nerds I think it's a fantastic I love drop out tv a lot of people do so I thoroughly enjoy that service but like it's
1453863	1456608	Yeah, something like that even, like having the episodes.
1456628	1461296	Do you know who is doing this and who is doing a good job with this?
1461316	1462097	Who does do this?
1462457	1467907	Who you don't normally think of as a game maker, but they definitely have a game ecosystem?
1468428	1468628	Apple.
1469209	1475820	Because Apple has an Apple One, I think it's called, and it's Apple Fitness, Apple Arcade, Apple...
1475800	1477602	Apple TV, maybe?
1478063	1478644	Apple Music?
1478784	1479064	I don't know.
1479084	1487255	There's several Apple products that the iPhone user is likely to use, all kind of bundled in one thing.
1487275	1491961	And so I do think that is a model that Microsoft and Sony ought to be looking at.
1491981	1500132	Whether that model is for you or not, I think it's something that is leaving people on the table from these other companies not trying something similar.
1500172	1500272	Yeah.
1500252	1505820	It's certainly, like, it's not entirely the same because it's more of, like, bundling services together.
1505840	1510487	But it's still, like, that's not a bad idea because, you know, you have all that under one ecosystem.
1510907	1518238	Like, that'd be different, like, if Microsoft had their own, like, Netflix-type thing and then they bundled it in with Xbox Game Pass or something like that.
1518418	1522164	Like, that would be... But more of what I was saying, it was, like, piecemeal stuff.
1522184	1526911	Like, I get it, streaming services and stuff, and they want to, like, kind of bundle it all together.
1526931	1529314	But I feel that, like, you could just...
1529294	1554913	I mean even with Nintendo and the virtual console I mean the way people, me, buy games like just impulsively all the time like I feel that they could make a lot more money than they are charging what is it $60 a year or whatever that is for Nintendo expansion pass and all that stuff like you could be making a lot you're leaving money on the table right there yeah but I don't know yeah
1554995	1556738	Yeah, I'm really surprised.
1557039	1569743	Again, kind of going back to the Apple thing, I'm surprised that Nintendo doesn't try to partner with a fitness company or partner with a multimedia to try to build a more rich thing than just the game.
1569863	1571186	It's just a little bit surprising to me.
1571206	1574472	I feel like these entertainment companies that...
1574452	1579038	You know, want to be about one box for movies, TVs and all of it.
1579058	1579699	They don't do it.
1580260	1592055	And it's weird to me how you have these large conglomerate companies like Sony that feel like they're so siloed where they don't work with each other.
1592115	1592876	I'm going to tell you another.
1592896	1593737	I'm going to tell you straight up.
1593757	1594979	I'm going to give my honest opinion.
1595340	1597122	I hope we don't get the plug pulled in the middle of it.
1597162	1598704	But Amazon's another one.
1598684	1624472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1624452	1627277	But my point is, it's not obvious.
1627718	1635952	One of the 30-second ads they should be running is tap now, click here to put this game in your cart on Amazon.
1636713	1639498	And you can finish that, you know, because I know one-touch shopping is a little weird.
1639518	1644346	But tap this button to put the game in your cart and you can go finish shopping on this stuff later.
1644707	1649515	Or just like leave it in their ecosystem because there's a lot of games that are available through Amazon.
1649495	1652698	Whatever the Amazon game service that we get free games on all the time.
1653018	1653338	Luna?
1653839	1655500	Or like the actual Amazon?
1655520	1657582	Which again, also if you... Once again.
1657742	1658603	It blows my mind.
1659204	1662687	Click now to play this game instantly on Luna with your Prime subscription.
1662947	1668652	Like the only thing where you see Amazon and Twitch playing together is the whole Twitch Prime.
1668792	1670934	No, and they do... You get your one sub.
1670954	1671855	You get your one sub.
1672356	1674598	It's not even Twitch because there's Twitch Turbo.
1674698	1675959	Well, you get games too.
1676079	1678461	Like there's all the free games that they're unlocked through there.
1678481	1678942	But that's not Twitch.
1678962	1679502	That's not Twitch.
1679482	1681553	It's not.
1681573	1682237	Amazon.
1682820	1684369	I don't know.
1684449	1686319	Technically it is because...
1688476	1689537	It's weird.
1689837	1694502	So AJ Twist in chat says, I feel like Amazon treats Twitch like an unwanted stepchild.
1694582	1695243	Yeah, kinda.
1696224	1703210	And again, the whole talk's about bandwidth and how much bandwidth costs, and it's like, yo, aren't you in cahoots with AWS?
1703591	1706614	And I understand that there is still a cost for it.
1706974	1715542	It's not inherently free, but they shouldn't... Like, AWS should be giving Twitch their best possible friends and family rate type of thing.
1715582	1716323	It's just...
1716303	1720532	It's so... Bobby says, Amazon charges Twitch full price to use AWS.
1720933	1724160	That makes no fucking sense.
1724500	1727306	Amazon is setting the site up to fail by doing that.
1727326	1728529	It's just wild to me.
1728649	1732978	And on top of that, it's also weird, though, to go to your consumers being like...
1733127	1735854	Well, it's your fault that it's too expensive.
1735874	1736796	Like, can you imagine?
1736916	1742870	Like, can you imagine just going into a restaurant and you order something like, ugh, you know, that thing you ordered?
1743031	1744955	We don't get much of a margin on that.
1745256	1748183	Like, can you imagine, like, treating your customers like that?
1748686	1750529	But here we are.
1750549	1753133	Here's Amazon intriguing its customers like that.
1753153	1757560	Fifth Dream in chat says there's a Discover Luna ad at the top always.
1757580	1758742	I guess I've... Oh, you know what?
1758762	1761746	I have Twitch Turbo, so I guess I don't see the same thing.
1761786	1764030	So to be fair, I don't see those same things.
1764050	1771381	But I wouldn't find a button in the corner to buy the game on Amazon like in some of the real estate they have between the About page and all that.
1771401	1777090	I wouldn't find that that intrusive, especially if the streamer is getting like a 3% kickback or whatever.
1777070	1783902	Whatever the affiliate agreement is for affiliate links, Twitch streamers should get basically the equivalent of that if people buy the game.
1784322	1791515	And to be quite honest, when they have the ad breaks here on Twitch, I'm sorry, I'm going to call it what it is.
1791535	1792396	Sorry, not sorry.
1792677	1796563	I don't give a fuck about crypto, and I think many of you don't either.
1796583	1800630	And so those crypto ads land on extremely...
1800610	1803116	Ears that do not want to hear.
1803497	1806083	I do not perceive, therefore it is not.
1806224	1808529	I don't give a shit about crypto.
1808970	1810614	But let me ask you this.
1810635	1811396	There are people who do.
1813040	1815767	But he was a major part of the Superman movie.
1816675	1817196	Shut up.
1817556	1817796	All right.
1818036	1818837	But let me say this.
1818897	1824223	OK, so for those of you that feel like I do about crypto, let's say that there's a 30 second ad on Twitch instead.
1824263	1832753	Let's say I'm streaming Donkey Kong Bonanza and you're one of those people in my chat the night I was streaming that the other night that said, oh, maybe I will get this game after all.
1833073	1843324	What if that 30 second ad instead was, hey, tap this button now to click on this ad now to put Donkey Kong Bonanza in your cart so that you can have it ready to go next time you're on Amazon?
1843304	1851593	But, with ads?
1851944	1856191	They run what the advertisers are paying them to run.
1856212	1856492	Oh, I know.
1856752	1857253	I know.
1857273	1857574	I know.
1857895	1859417	So there is nothing.
1859678	1862823	I mean, yeah, that would be common sense and be great for people.
1863204	1864887	But that's not how the machine works.
1865087	1865468	Yeah.
1865488	1868052	The machine is run on whoever is paying for it.
1868072	1868653	I get that.
1868714	1872781	But I would think increasing sales of video games is also funding the machine.
1872821	1873502	Like it's just another way.
1873542	1874905	I'm not saying it would be solely.
1874945	1876888	I'm not saying it would be solely those ads.
1877543	1884679	Only if they have partnership with those companies and then it would still be just the games that those companies want to do.
1884699	1893319	They're not always going to I don't think that there's any sort of thing built in to have it sync with whatever you're playing.
1894000	1896025	It's just a generic push.
1896005	1899812	They push whatever is going to be in that particular time frame.
1900072	1901275	That's changing.
1901575	1906645	That's absolutely changing because we hear this with Netflix and their whole AI thing and how they're going to have ads.
1906665	1908268	But I'm not talking about Netflix.
1908308	1909911	I'm talking about Twitch and Amazon.
1910612	1913457	But isn't it silly they're not operating on the same level?
1914618	1944625	That's not our decision to make.
1944605	1946829	I haven't seen an ad in years, so I don't know.
1947009	1950394	Take one out of every... I see them when I'm watching on my non-computer.
1950454	1953619	I watch on a different thing where I'm not logged in.
1954240	1958027	Take one out of every two of those ads and replace it with what I was talking about before.
1958087	1960891	It just doesn't make sense.
1960911	1968123	And my point is, with these big companies, I don't understand why they don't work with each other to make better things for themselves.
1968223	1969665	They all have a common interest in this.
1970186	1971388	It's just wild.
1971368	1989765	it's just wild well and the other thing too to speak out about about Turbo is that the people that you're watching still get a cut out of Turbo whatever they would have gotten for the ads that play they get the equivalent cut in Turbo yep
1989745	1994291	So the streamers are still getting benefit if you've got Turbo.
1994791	2003222	I mean, it's even better if you sub or donate to streamers that you like, because then you are supporting their channel more directly.
2003242	2009610	But they've got to make up their server money or whatever somehow.
2009830	2011633	I'm not talking to people who have Turbo right now.
2011653	2015598	I'm talking to people who don't or might be on the fence about it.
2017520	2019162	But in the end, I mean...
2020728	2023573	There's still a big, massive push on crypto.
2023593	2026218	There's still a ton of people that are behind it.
2026739	2032128	And so people to get more money out of it are going to be pushing it and they are paying for the ads.
2032168	2033130	End of story.
2033731	2034973	You know, we don't want to see them.
2035013	2040964	I mean, we get car ads and I mean, are you going to really expect car ads on a Roblox stream?
2042699	2043781	You're still gonna get them.
2045083	2045383	Maybe.
2046665	2048107	You're still gonna get them.
2048247	2057662	Or for kid-friendly channels, there's still gonna be ads for things that those kids don't care about, won't see, have no need to know about.
2058303	2059965	It's just whoever...
2059945	2064030	Whoever happens to pay for that, that's what we get.
2064070	2071999	If we don't like it, then there is leaving feedback for these places instead of just putting it out into the ether.
2072760	2075142	That's the way things happen.
2075322	2085514	It's something like this statistically that for every eight people who have a problem with the service or something, only one of them says something about it.
2086355	2089661	You mentioned about Twitch Turbo and people that don't have that yet.
2089942	2098699	I've been saying this for years and I think the last breath of Twitch... Y'all are going to hate me for saying this, but it's going to happen someday.
2099099	2108818	If this site continues to be banging the can against the bars to get money or whatever, I think the dying breath is...
2108798	2124680	I don't think it will.
2125080	2133912	I don't think it will.
2135275	2136596	That's true.
2139059	2163021	I agree with that.
2163473	2167168	and on top of that too with any of the other streamers they are getting that ad revenue.
2167871	2169658	One way or another ad revenue is happening.
2169738	2171425	They have nothing to say about it.
2172046	2200247	there's also embedded ads there are also every so often there'll be those people who are like oh let me cheer something for you and let me get a sub and of course Twitch gets 50% of that sub unless you're in the top tier of partner so I mean
2201003	2204168	They're recouping a decent bit from people.
2205650	2208734	So I don't think it's going to happen.
2208754	2210577	The financial statements say otherwise.
2210737	2211979	The layoffs say otherwise.
2212239	2213882	Twitch is not really bringing in a profit.
2213902	2217106	But I don't think that Turbo is going to become a required thing.
2217146	2223215	They may start charging more for other services, but I don't think that Turbo is going to become a requirement for everybody to stream.
2223876	2228583	If anything, I think that they may introduce different tiers of Turbo.
2229684	2230065	Hmm.
2230433	2231295	I can see that, I guess.
2231455	2237768	Which is stupid, but... Like, you get base turbo, which is bypassing the ads.
2238570	2241657	And then you get turbo plus five subs.
2242519	2243521	You pay a little bit more.
2244142	2248932	And it ends up costing less than five subs, but you get to apply those subs to other people.
2249806	2252672	Discounted subs to subscribe to multiple people.
2252692	2256199	That is kind of a thing that I'm surprised also Twitch doesn't sort of have that.
2256299	2259505	Like a Costco sort of thing.
2260707	2262351	You hear that, Twitch execs?
2262391	2262831	Hire me.
2262852	2263894	I'll fix your problems.
2265076	2268743	Hey, I have the most unpopular idea you could possibly implement.
2270377	2271739	They're not going to do it.
2271759	2274523	They know they would lose people immediately.
2275884	2281853	I'm still wanting Kick to fail horribly just because of how toxic it is.
2282634	2286078	I'm with you there, but otherwise Twitch doesn't really have competitors.
2286499	2288562	I think YouTube is such a different platform.
2288922	2293408	Everybody always says, but YouTube, it's like, YouTube is really for on-demand.
2293568	2295431	I think it really lacks when it comes to live.
2296012	2299236	YouTube streaming has some very interesting features.
2299216	2320380	I might have mentioned this on the channel before, but they have this thing they were implementing where if there is a certain amount of dead air or something that they will automatically interject an ad.
2320681	2335478	and a lot of times people will work the way that they present their audio in such a way so that it triggers and added a specific moment or that people would have to rewind to re-listen to that and they'd get more airtime.
2336078	2339022	It's a big thing with YouTube.
2339482	2349253	And then there's been a lot of risk of demonetization for some of the practices that were a year ago perfectly sanctioned.
2350178	2351900	So there's a lot of drama.
2351920	2352921	All right, well, let's move on.
2352961	2357967	We're going to get into our gaming weeks and talk about the types of games that we have been playing this week.
2358228	2359589	I need to step away real quick.
2360210	2363554	So Jamie, I don't know if you want to elaborate, but if not, we'll throw it over to Matt.
2363574	2364095	I'll be right back.
2365517	2378953	I mean, I also did, you know, a lot of, I beat Mass Effect 3 and I started over with the first Mass Effect, but I finally, finally got a Mass Effect 2 save editor to work.
2379372	2388267	and I tested it just a little while ago and it is working beautifully.
2388288	2402933	So I will be skipping Mass Effect again just because the gameplay is not particularly fantastic as much as I love the story and we'll be going into Mass Effect 2 later and testing to see if I can edit what my character looks like.
2402913	2428498	so yay for that also of course Dead by Daylight we're through the we're supposed to be through the event I thought or we're not getting any extra bullet points or anything but I've got everything I need for the event so I'm just running around playing pig and being a menace you know as usual playing some polya so there you go cool
2428732	2431675	I did Minecraft, as usual.
2432877	2435620	How does your Knot Cracker Barrel?
2437262	2442488	It's probably the most profitable store on the server because they sell everything that people want.
2442508	2445551	So I'm making tons of money off of it, as usual.
2445911	2448655	But I'm still waiting for everybody else to set up shops because that's the problem.
2448695	2451298	I make a ton of money and I have nothing to do with it.
2451318	2455262	I have nothing to buy because no one sells anything.
2455529	2481064	but I there are a few people that are setting up more shops so that's gonna be good um yeah it's been doing well it's just uh right now we have our sign paintings mod is is not updated yet so my wonderful cracker barrel logo is missing at the moment um until that's updated right now it just looks like a sign and you could call it canker barrel
2482242	2484205	We got Krushy and Loaf.
2484366	2485548	It's already there.
2485688	2486729	But yeah, it's doing well.
2487070	2492239	I haven't decided to make... I was thinking about making another shop, but it'd be smaller and underground.
2492740	2494222	So we'll get to that at some point.
2494242	2495604	I've been working mostly this week.
2495624	2496185	Underground?
2496205	2497247	Like a bootleg shop?
2498105	2499308	No, no, no.
2499328	2502496	So we have a tunnel.
2502596	2513042	So coming off of the person that's building next to the main shopping district area, they have a post-apocalyptic tunnel
2513984	2531976	Thanks for watching!
2531956	2533578	Tunnel for cars.
2533618	2538345	And so there's cars broken down down there and there's like different shops in there as well.
2538365	2540468	It's like more space to put shops.
2540488	2542691	And so it would be down in that.
2542711	2544534	We had that kind of similar last season.
2544614	2548339	We had a sewer that we had shops in, so I had an arcade in the sewer.
2548439	2549040	That was kind of fun.
2549080	2557111	We had our totally normal ninja camels that were, you know, dressed up like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
2557492	2558033	That was fun.
2558934	2559735	Um...
2560070	2567680	But yeah, it would be one that sells like spooky stuff, like skulk and bone blocks and stuff like that.
2567700	2574568	So that, because I have a lot of that right now, like my farms that produce that stuff are just overflowing.
2574629	2576231	So I just need to get rid of it somehow.
2577692	2579194	So that'd probably do that.
2579214	2583079	But yeah, no, this week I've been actually working on our battle arena thing.
2583099	2587265	So I finished building it and I kind of showed it off a little bit on the stream.
2587285	2588406	It's like massive.
2588386	2618089	but the game itself that's going to be in there requires coding a data pack because it's not something you can do it in vanilla Minecraft or you can do it in vanilla Minecraft you can't do it in survival Minecraft I should say because it requires summoning lots of monsters and stuff stuff that you would use commands to do and so I have to code the data pack for that so I've been working on that and making some progress although it's been not functioning quite like I want it to like for some reason it's just not
2618609	2635808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2635788	2652058	and I didn't update that for this version either so I'm like why does my old stuff work but this new one doesn't because I'm doing exactly the same thing I literally copied files from one to the other I don't understand but I'm sure I'll figure it out I'm sure it'll be something stupid like
2653220	2675616	in the past it's been like oh we changed the name of this directory it has to be this now instead of this and so you have to read all of their patch notes to figure out what's changed or like look at existing data packs that do work and figure out okay what were they doing differently than I am and all that stuff but yeah it's it's coming along it'll be fun it's um
2676389	2680595	It could be very massive, but it'll be something that kind of lasts the rest of the season.
2680635	2684782	I can start working on my other mega game that is survival friendly.
2684842	2686704	So we'll see how that goes.
2686724	2687946	But I'm excited to get this done.
2689028	2689388	All right.
2690911	2691512	My gaming week.
2691572	2696679	OK, so before I get to my gaming week, I want to mention this because, Jamie, you were talking about seeing a blast in the past earlier.
2696699	2699604	You saw like Wendell and, you know, some other blasts in the past.
2699884	2705232	I also saw a blast from the past this week, and I'm going deep into OLR lore here.
2705212	2723254	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
2723234	2753055	who I ran into at the grocery store of all places Gay Garrett from those days who I haven't talked to I haven't talked to him in probably 17 years we just fell out of touch as things sometimes go sometimes and I ran into him at the grocery store of all places and it was like one of those like whoa it has been some time so now we have plans to get caught up next week and he's never met Alan because it's been that long I was like yeah
2753035	2753937	How's he doing?
2754658	2756080	Good, as far as I know, good.
2756120	2758925	He actually lives not far from me.
2759766	2762070	I got a quick little recap on all of that.
2762090	2765496	So yeah, I'll let you know more after we get to touch base this week.
2765516	2769262	But I just thought that was... Brandon, you went to a convention and saw somebody else.
2769322	2770985	I went to the grocery store and ran into somebody.
2771947	2773469	How chance is that, right?
2774070	2776815	And yeah...
2776795	2777897	We have plans to hang out this week.
2778277	2778658	Who knows?
2778718	2781583	Maybe I'll get him back on the show someday to talk about what he's up to in gaming.
2781843	2783025	Checking out his Instagram.
2783085	2785549	I think he's game designing now a little bit.
2785569	2787151	So I'll be very curious.
2787192	2789716	I don't think there's a product out there yet, but maybe in the future.
2790136	2792640	So yeah, kind of random.
2792881	2798810	So yeah, I was like, yeah, you should meet Alan, the guy I've been with for 15 years that I've married that you just never met.
2799050	2799411	Yeah.
2800673	2803240	So anyway, random, random.
2803380	2811120	Okay, but otherwise, my gaming week and the stuff that I oh, yeah, and I had I told him this show was still going and that we were acknowledged by Guinness last year.
2811140	2817957	And he's like, wow, that you know, this is probably just probably the whole shock of like, oh, seeing somebody I haven't seen in a very, very, very long time.
2817937	2819761	So, yeah, wild.
2819781	2822787	SG100Matt says, I feel like he was a regular on Outside the Box.
2822967	2824530	Oh, that is old OLR lore.
2824911	2825592	He might have been.
2826474	2831203	Literally, those days were a blur, so I couldn't tell you who were the regulars in that day.
2831604	2834089	Just that it was a lot more...
2834069	2836595	The place we lived was more Grand Central Station.
2836655	2839381	People were coming over all the time and showing up on random shows.
2839461	2841105	So, you know, it was a different era.
2841125	2841406	All right.
2841847	2842529	Back to video games.
2843030	2844533	The games I've been playing this week.
2844553	2848783	Honestly, mostly Final Fantasy XIV, actually, which I know I bring that game up a lot.
2848803	2853073	But usually it's like, oh, I'll sign in, check on auctions and kind of not do a lot.
2853053	2866945	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2867853	2869435	Why can't I remember the name of the class?
2869515	2870316	Pictomancer.
2870717	2873100	I was like, Paint Master.
2873500	2875363	Pictomancer.
2875763	2878146	I'm finally playing, which is actually a lot of fun.
2878366	2882632	Once I figured out, because it's weird at first when you play it.
2882652	2887718	You're like, why do I spend like four seconds casting, painting these paintings?
2887778	2888900	And what do they do?
2888920	2890101	Like, once you kind of figure that out.
2890121	2890722	It takes time.
2890702	2892908	Yeah, exactly.
2893469	2898503	Once you kind of figure all that stuff out, it actually feels really good.
2898523	2901130	It's a really fun class to play, so I'm really enjoying it.
2901150	2902233	So there's that.
2902253	2905180	And then some other stuff I talk about.
2905501	2906584	And then some new games!
2906564	2909068	I played Donkey Kong Bonanza.
2909169	2909950	I played this week.
2910010	2911933	I did end up buying it a little bit on a whim.
2912414	2915279	I did a stream of it on Twitch the night it came out.
2915860	2918384	And I put the archive up on YouTube, if anybody cares.
2918424	2923253	If you want to see the first two hours of the game with me commenting on it over on my YouTube channel, Rob Roberts Plays.
2923874	2926759	And I'm actually really enjoying it.
2926939	2932048	It is a lot like Mario Odyssey, but also very different, which I know is a horrible explanation.
2932028	2954982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2954962	2970237	and that is Minecraft without the crafting so it's half Mario Odyssey and half mine because you're like breaking bricks trying to dig to find the secret passages to find things and of course you know you can you can do unlimited bashing of bricks but
2970217	2977710	There is concrete and other things you can't bash through, or you might have to get a power-up to bash through it that makes it a little bit harder.
2977830	2984502	So there is some borders on what you can destroy, but the level design is really good.
2984542	2986065	I was playing the first...
2986045	2987248	Open Area Level.
2987288	3000075	There's like a whole tutorial level and then there's like an open area level and there was a whole thing where like, oh, as you go through it, the water gets higher and higher and you kind of figure things out as far as navigating to different stuff.
3000115	3002500	And figuring things out is part of the fun.
3002520	3004003	So I guess there's sort of that
3004608	3029873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3029853	3032638	All right, that's it for my gaming week.
3032658	3034622	So we will get into some gaming news.
3034742	3037006	I do want to mention just a brief bit of housekeeping.
3037407	3043077	There's going to be two shows I'm going to be missing in August, and that's just because of some prior commitments.
3043158	3047285	We will not be here the night of August 17th.
3047826	3048928	I will be out of town.
3048948	3051473	I'm going to be in, I think it's the 17th.
3052212	3067572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3067552	3086303	and then I will not be here DragonCon week which is going to be Sunday the 31st of August I will not be here yeah it's the 17th of the 31st so just a heads up there'll be a couple shows that uh we will not have in August because of that so um but if you are in the Atlanta area or
3086283	3088746	Heaven forbid, DragonCon is so huge.
3088766	3092952	I would say generally the Southeast and even people like me.
3093072	3102104	I'm not the only one that travels all the way from California because I tell you when I get on that flight that goes out to Atlanta, there's always at least a dozen other DragonCon people on that flight.
3102384	3106570	And I always know who they are because they're bringing in the big fucking carry-ons with all their cosplay.
3106550	3111196	I know there's people that travel all over for DragonCon.
3111777	3114060	I will be back on August 31st.
3114240	3117925	I do not know what panels I will be doing yet.
3117945	3128798	The only thing I can guarantee as far as panels go, and I would say this would be your best chance to meet me, is that Thursday night, the Digital Media Track will be hosting a content creator mixer.
3129159	3131562	And you don't have to be a content creator to show up.
3131542	3158781	and I also know Thursday night even though technically the con has started by then it's also the night before things get really crazy so if you are going to DragonCon you know just make a mental note Thursday night swing on by the content creator mixer it's going to be in the basement of the Hilton in the same room that Digital Media Track's been in for years we'd love to say hi and yeah and mix if you are a content creator you should absolutely come mix a little bit so it'll be fun
3158963	3160345	I have a little announcement too.
3160946	3161487	Do ya, do ya?
3161567	3162748	Alright, what's up?
3162769	3177450	Yes, I'm doing a marathon on August 9th and I will also be more than happy to host a Q&A that first Sunday that you're gone.
3178291	3178632	Fun!
3178652	3183298	So, show a little bit of some of the stuff I'm working on behind the scenes for Orange Lounge.
3183318	3184901	Alrighty, fun fun.
3185121	3186523	But, but yeah.
3187685	3189649	All right.
3190070	3194659	Well, let's move on and get into some gaming headlines.
3195181	3196143	Loki, you want to start us off?
3197004	3197826	Yeah.
3197966	3199770	So, well...
3200864	3208076	Apparently, Microsoft has been known to reward studios that have done well with layoffs.
3208717	3218333	But in this case, it's not like some of the other games in the past, but this is more because of this studio's function.
3218313	3225005	So Virtuos is a team that they do support work on a lot of games that come out.
3225105	3231417	So like they've worked on the Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remaster, Metal Gear Solid, Delta, Snake Eater, that type of stuff.
3232318	3237267	They're apparently cutting 300 people as of now.
3237247	3261246	I guess now it basically they had 4,200 employees across multiple countries and apparently these cuts are impacting roles mostly in Asia and in Europe and this is because they don't have partner companies to work with or at least as many partner companies to work with as a co-developer in those countries
3261226	3288955	but that still sucks though layoffs as a whole kind of suck but at least this sort of makes sense it's not just like we're doing it because of profits or something like that but yeah that's unfortunate especially since they've worked on a lot of games and even recently with the cyberpunks the brand new patch for that the update that you know improved a ton of things that they added to that game that is of course also the same company
3289036	3292543	But yeah, it's unfortunate that they're kind of getting cut at this point.
3293023	3296510	That is super ridiculous, you know, when they're doing so well.
3296530	3302922	But I guess I am hearing in that, correct me if I'm wrong, that basically they don't have other products to work on.
3303283	3306889	So if they don't have those other agreements with... In those areas, yeah.
3306929	3309194	So maybe they'll rehire in other areas.
3309294	3310977	But like, I can't help but think like...
3310957	3318480	Some of these games that are coming out of Microsoft and other studios, man, they could use some co-developers on some of these things.
3318761	3323776	Right, here we go, back to that large conglomerate thing that doesn't seem to know how to work with itself.
3323796	3325000	Like, it's just wild.
3325452	3336129	Yeah, I mean, at least this isn't exactly like Hi-Fi Rush or whatever, where they just straight up, oh, we're gonna shut you down after your successful game, but I don't know.
3336149	3336429	Yeah.
3338252	3342419	Alright, well, yeah, I just... I don't know.
3343320	3344001	It's...
3344403	3349094	It is hard to stay a fan of an industry that treats its workers so terribly.
3349395	3357214	Honestly, like, yeah, the whole, like, Microsoft acquisition thing, like, went from, like, woohoo, Bobby Kotick's out to, oh, they suck.
3357548	3365501	Well, and I hate to say it, but I still believe the alternative was worse.
3366482	3366863	True.
3366883	3368405	I know that sounds terrible.
3368445	3368906	I don't know.
3368926	3369747	It seems very mismanaged right now.
3369767	3372372	You can look at it and go, these are two bad things.
3372892	3376819	Bobby Kotick being at the head of all these layoffs would have been a worse thing.
3376859	3379783	Well, Bobby Kotick would have still done the layoffs.
3380124	3380685	Absolutely.
3381146	3382688	And he did.
3382848	3383910	It's just...
3383890	3389183	It sucks that this isn't a better environment, it feels like.
3389223	3396460	It's just that there's still just as many layoffs, despite making the assertions that they're not going to do that.
3397302	3398525	Just, I don't know.
3399789	3399889	Yeah.
3399909	3400009	Yeah.
3402233	3405317	Well, I don't even know how to follow that up.
3405337	3408481	So let's talk about what indies can do that's fun.
3408541	3415110	And I completely recognize that the answer is not always, well, go form an indie studio.
3415130	3416912	Yes, that takes investment and time.
3417052	3424782	And yes, but I can always look to the indie scene to set the trends and lean into certain trends.
3424762	3431733	I don't know how many of y'all saw this going on this weekend, but there was this whole viral moment that involved a Coldplay concert.
3431854	3434798	And I'm sure those two words made y'all go, oh, I saw that.
3435179	3443673	So we saw the CEO of a very large AI company, right, who got on the Kiss Cam, which is, you know, the Jumbotron.
3443693	3444594	And this is during concert.
3445115	3450043	He was shown canoodling with, I guess she was the VP of Human Resources or something high up.
3450023	3474833	both of this company and they were both married to other people by the way so it's caused this whole rift and it's it's interesting because if she hadn't overreacted the clip probably would have never went viral in the first place people probably would have recognized them and there probably still would have been an issue but um it probably wouldn't be on TikTok you know viewed 11 billion times in all these different countries so obviously or you know if they hadn't done it in the first place
3474813	3494661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3494641	3498067	Um, so we want to take a moment to feature some of you in the audience.
3498507	3506661	So, uh, if you want to take a moment to do your makeup, now's a good time, or you might want to, uh, turn away for a minute, you know, type of thing.
3506681	3509105	Like they, they very obviously gave a warning.
3509586	3509926	I don't know.
3509946	3510788	No making out.
3511769	3514033	You know, and here's the thing, here's the thing.
3514469	3522486	I'm sure that those two that got caught feel some sort of way about breaking up at a Coldplay concert.
3522506	3527597	But did you know I once had a relationship end at a Natasha Bedingfield concert?
3527877	3528559	True story.
3528940	3529561	True story.
3530002	3531465	That was my ex...
3531445	3534209	Before Alan, so it was a long time ago because I've been with Alan for 15 years.
3534510	3535972	But that was my ex before Alan.
3536953	3539537	I'll have to tell this story on TikTok or something, make it longer sometime.
3539577	3549792	But long story short, there was a part where Natasha Bedingfield, who of course was like – had a few songs in the early aughts of –
3549772	3551855	I got a pocket full of sunshine.
3551895	3552395	That was her.
3553417	3555339	I think the rest is still unwritten.
3555399	3556781	That was her too.
3557041	3557923	So she had a song.
3557963	3561487	I don't remember the name of the song, but she basically goes, where are all the single people at?
3561988	3563850	And my ex jumped up and started cheering.
3564191	3567495	And that's when he became my... Because we had been fighting the whole way to the concert.
3567795	3570158	And so he decided he was going to stick it to me by doing that.
3570218	3571100	And I said, well, fine.
3571460	3572401	It's over then.
3572421	3574504	But that's when... That is also the night.
3574584	3576066	So it was me, him...
3576046	3586949	and it was Arya Snark or Lady Victoria from Shaking and Crying and our other friend who I, because what ended up happening that night is we split off and I went out with Victoria at the State Fair.
3587249	3587971	I had a great time.
3588091	3595286	I had a great time with Victoria and that's the night we became besties and we're still, you know, that was the best thing I got out of that divorce was Victoria.
3595727	3595827	Yeah.
3596684	3607540	But to this day, I feel so bad for the other girl in this situation who had to go off with my ex and probably had to listen to all his sniveling crying.
3607560	3623923	So my agreement is if she ever does decide to have a child, I will agree since she had to babysit a rottling, sniffling baby at some point, for me, I will babysit a sniffling baby for her when she needs it.
3624089	3652476	Coldplay Canoodlers
3652456	3670363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3670343	3688875	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3688855	3714863	Really a game, it's more of a moment But anyway, that is what was made And at least I appreciate that they're being upfront about the AI So at least you make your own decision if it's for you or not I don't think it's anything being sold or anything It's just something that you go out there and just Where is this game if you want to actually Because he said I made a game And then it's on social media But I didn't actually see a link to actually get the game
3715585	3727924	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3728208	3730650	But then I don't see if the game is actually for sale somewhere.
3730690	3732852	But that's okay because I wouldn't buy anything.
3733132	3734153	Oh, this is funny.
3734173	3738217	He does have a little post that shows it's all over TikTok.
3738537	3740179	So isn't that ironic?
3740199	3740979	Isn't that ironic?
3741640	3743962	You used AI and he's not complaining about it.
3743982	3748847	So I'm not saying this to bash this guy who used AI or whatever to bring an idea to life, whatever.
3749507	3751729	It is all over TikTok.
3751749	3758215	So isn't that ironic that your piece of art got stolen and turned into other pieces of art all over TikTok?
3758195	3762399	It's like rain on your wedding day.
3762419	3764381	It's literally a free ride when you already paid.
3767985	3770107	It's a good advice that you just didn't take.
3770908	3771488	Who would have thought?
3771589	3772029	It figures.
3772129	3774552	Alright, that's it.
3775232	3777615	Oh, I guess it's open to offers.
3777635	3778335	Oh, who cares?
3778355	3778796	Who cares?
3778816	3779777	Nobody's going to buy this game.
3780297	3783120	Alright, moving on.
3783140	3784982	Why buy the cow when you can have the sex for free?
3785002	3785322	It's a moment.
3785382	3785923	It's a moment.
3788317	3789439	Not bad!
3790180	3790841	No!
3791883	3791983	No!
3792003	3794126	You buy a cow and become lactose intolerant.
3794186	3796009	Bad analogy, Loki.
3796129	3796650	Bad.
3797391	3799114	Bad, bad, bad.
3799134	3801057	It's from Mallrats.
3801077	3802239	Oh, yeah, that's right.
3802259	3806505	You were just quoting a... That's right, you were just quoting a... Where were we?
3806525	3808148	Oh, yeah, DarkSakura, you were next.
3809208	3810932	Yeah, there's a thing.
3811533	3826744	There's an Italian YouTuber who takes retro gaming consoles, just like Android-based ones, different systems like that, that may or may not be able to have...
3827939	3845408	Rom's and things of games or may come with them preloaded but on April 15th his home got raided and they confiscated the police raided his place and took 30 consoles and
3846822	3848805	and now he may be facing jail time.
3850167	3851409	He's got some legal fees.
3851890	3865371	The raid was done by the Guardia di Finanza which is a militarized Italian police force for economical and financial crimes.
3865391	3866232	But
3867342	3876072	They wouldn't exactly disclose what he had been charged with, but now he has a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees.
3877533	3888045	But apparently the Guardia de Finanza is taking, quote, precautionary measures to block all of his social media channels.
3889006	3895493	So he's got a defense attorney and he thinks it's going to go to trial, but this is still some bullshit.
3896468	3906242	Yeah, and to be clear, it sounds like the issue, what I'm understanding they're taking issue with is the fact that some of these handhelds had ROMs preloaded on it.
3906262	3906843	And we've seen this.
3907223	3913472	I have a friend that owns, well, I have a friend that owns one of these arcade sticks that he bought off Amazon.
3913793	3916136	Like it's a big fighting game stick, like for two player.
3916517	3920282	And it has like thousands of MAME ROMs already on it.
3920262	3922445	And I know that gets into a legal gray area.
3922546	3927954	So I'm assuming that Italian copyright law is going really to the extreme here with this.
3928215	3936608	Well, to be fair, like the stuff that he was reviewing, like a lot of the Amber Nick stuff, like I should know because I just bought one not that long ago.
3936868	3937469	Allegedly.
3937690	3938972	You can go to jail for that, Loki.
3938992	3939773	Allegedly.
3939888	3967448	Aliexpress
3967428	3975807	Well, AliExpress and Amazon, well, those folks, the sellers on there don't necessarily follow the rules.
3975827	3978573	And so, yes, they will load the console with ROMs.
3979074	3979615	Now...
3980860	4000978	I don't think they know better or care.
4000958	4002479	They don't know better, Karen.
4002519	4006863	Why are you going after a user and not the actual... Like, why is this person going to jail and not the seller?
4006924	4008145	Like, that doesn't make any sense.
4008165	4010287	Because it's easier to go after the users.
4010307	4011027	There's many there.
4012489	4013209	Make an example.
4013229	4014310	They're making an example.
4014330	4016012	That's what it is.
4016032	4023859	It is incredibly stupid, but basically it comes down to they're just Android devices with controllers built into them is essentially what they are.
4024280	4027843	They are an Android tablet device that can...
4028296	4034825	You can put whatever you want on it, but it can also run emulators and all that stuff.
4035085	4036927	Like any other Android device.
4038469	4047020	The fact that they're coming in and seizing these devices, it's not that these are perpetrating piracy or anything like that.
4047040	4048442	Any Android device does that.
4048462	4054690	It's just this is in a handheld format that makes it better to game on, I guess.
4055071	4056112	It's stupid.
4056653	4058235	It's an overreach, obviously.
4058485	4062733	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, my favorite is that there are mall kiosks here in the U.S.
4062753	4064937	that have these with all the ROMs preloaded.
4065258	4066420	I even saw one in Vegas.
4066500	4067262	Oh, yeah.
4067502	4071450	Go to any flea market out there and you'll see these things everywhere.
4071811	4072231	For sure.
4072913	4074436	Again, this is Italy.
4074536	4079886	It's not the U.S., but you kind of still would go, surely the malls in Italy...
4079866	4081889	You would see these same sorts of things.
4081969	4088337	Like, I can't imagine that it would be that different that these things aren't floating around just as easily, you know?
4088357	4099292	It is still technically illegal to like... I just... It's weird, though, that like... You can't... I mean, at least in the United States, as far as I'm aware, I'm not gonna...
4099272	4127052	DarkSakura.com
4127032	4133363	Oh, I know people who are still being held illegally, so...
4133680	4134220	I'm sure.
4134321	4137944	I mean, like, yes, this is obviously going on.
4138004	4143008	This, you know, thinking about the game console isn't necessarily, like, the biggest news.
4143028	4144890	But, like, it's weird, though.
4145130	4148153	Like, I'd be more interested, like, who made that complaint.
4148173	4151416	Because, like, the police aren't just watching YouTube channels.
4151576	4152837	It's somebody complaining about it.
4152857	4155219	That's a very good thing to bring up.
4155239	4158723	Because somebody probably had a vendetta for this guy.
4158803	4163687	And I will just go so far as to say it was probably, it was allegedly jealousy.
4163667	4179617	and DarkSakura.com.
4179597	4198770	DarkKnight90 in chat says you can find them in Amazon dump bin stores I didn't even think about those types of places I think he means like here locally we have falling prices and that's cheap which is basically what he's talking about those types of places I think
4199324	4229112	I think falling prices is literally a target dump store is what that is so yeah it's like don't get me wrong like these emulation devices the ones that those guys are reviewing aren't cheap it's not something you can find cheaper things that aren't as powerful they cost like about 50 bucks but like the ones he was reviewing were like several hundred dollars like these are serious you know collector devices if you're going to be using in fact there was one I saw that recently they're
4229092	4254660	Talk about it, it like, it converts from something that looks like a Nintendo Switch into something that looks like a 3DS It's like really crazy, but, and that's like $600 So you can get really crazy with these emulation devices as far as how powerful they are But, it's still no, like, he shouldn't be in trouble with the law because of this Like, I guess, like, I mean, I don't know
4255433	4259238	It's weird, because why prosecute this crime?
4259298	4260920	Have you taken care of all the other crimes?
4260940	4263804	Is this the most pressing thing that we need to be addressing right now?
4265406	4270113	All right, let's move on with our next story, because this is a big deal.
4270133	4272436	Yves Guillemin, we may finally get our wish.
4272516	4275720	Yves Guillemin is leaving, right?
4276004	4294114	Well, I don't know if he's leaving, necessarily, but apparently, since Ubisoft got their big cast influx from Tencent, they are now looking to split Ubisoft, or at least create...
4294280	4320405	Run a new set of studios, Ubisoft North America Studios Which is now going to be headed by Christopher Drenas And Charlie Gamal Because, you know, nepotism all the way down But apparently, so he's going to have his son run this company And, um...
4320385	4327515	Yeah, in fact, I guess Variety did some piece with Charlie Gamal over the appointment.
4327535	4330759	It says, I completely understand where it comes from, and I want to be clear about it.
4330799	4331960	Yes, I'm his son.
4332701	4334264	That's not something I hide from.
4334284	4334944	I mean, it should be.
4335766	4340472	But my appointment isn't only about family ties.
4340512	4342815	It's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment.
4342795	4371537	I showed my dad that I can sexual harass people just as good as anybody else there's more to this too because this is the same guy who I think it was like Owl something was the company under Ubisoft he was running were responsible for using right wing rhetoric against and Black Lives Matter imagery to paint a really nasty picture against this revolutionary group in a game that he had done I have to look it back up again
4371517	4399465	he left Ubisoft in the wake of all of that and went to work with an AI company he left in 2001 to work for an AI web 3 company called Unagi and apparently he was making it's just named Eel, that's funny he was working on mobile games like Tom Clancy's Elite Squad
4400322	4400983	Cool.
4401003	4402746	I'm sure it will suck there, too.
4403728	4405131	Ubisoft is, like, fucked.
4405291	4405792	Completely.
4406152	4410701	And it was already not in a great shape, and now it's just like, oh, we're just gonna watch this shit burn.
4410741	4412324	We are gonna watch it fucking burn.
4412584	4419276	Because now you're bringing in a person that was at an AI... I mean, even without all the other stuff that Jamie said...
4419256	4422461	Was that an AI company is now going to be leading Ubisoft?
4422481	4424964	Oh, that's going to make for some great decisions in that space.
4425245	4428709	I can't fucking wait to see what happens to future Assassin's Creed games.
4429090	4437562	This company's fucked, and I am so sorry to the ground-level staff that work hard to make the games at that company.
4437862	4441468	I am so sorry to all of you for what you're inevitably going through with this.
4441528	4443611	Now we could end up being completely wrong about this.
4443631	4446715	I would rather not be a doomsayer, but...
4448517	4455632	I'm sorry, but in light of everything you just said about this guy, you think he's going to I'm not talking about the guy.
4456494	4460402	I'm not talking about the guy because I don't really know anything about the Montreal CEO.
4461725	4465513	I'd have to look a little bit more into his background, but it's the two of them.
4466135	4473227	I'm hoping that the other guy, I mean, again, like I said, I don't know that much about him.
4473247	4478256	I'd have to look up more, but I'm hoping that we might get a little bit more of a balancing from that guy.
4481181	4483806	I won't be able to make a determination until I know more.
4484815	4487040	Yeah, I mean, like, let's put it this way.
4487060	4489786	Like, I don't have much investment in Ubisoft anyways.
4489806	4492251	Like, I've already kind of written them off a long time ago.
4492272	4492733	Same, same.
4493334	4494396	I don't care.
4494436	4495298	Like, whatever.
4495759	4497062	It does well fit for you.
4497102	4498525	As long as I can keep playing my Avatar game, I'm happy.
4499427	4501312	Yeah, I mean, it's just like, whatever.
4501432	4504258	Like, I don't care.
4504323	4515823	Speaking of don't care, Ubisoft, they also were addressing this whole stop killing games thing after, you know, of course it made the number of signatures that needs to get, you know, viewed.
4516565	4523597	And of course, you know, Ysgamont is there with his wonderful bit of...
4524252	4525613	Advice, I guess.
4526154	4532079	Basically saying, well, you know, support for all games can't last forever.
4532840	4535782	Regarding the petition, we operate in a market.
4536203	4540727	And whenever we release a game, we provide lots of support for the game.
4541087	4548894	We also provide lots of services to make the game accessible, or make sure that it is accessible and remains playable 24-7.
4549535	4554259	Information regarding the game and how long it can be played, though, you know,
4554239	4565987	So they just didn't release that.
4566811	4574463	Yeah, they just said they may cancel, you know, access to one or more specified online features upon a 30-day notice.
4575124	4583056	But yeah, but once again, this is like some GishGala bullshit, because they're not asking you to support the game for all time.
4583076	4591990	They're asking you, when you decide that you don't want to support the game, that you provide the tools so that support can be offloaded onto somebody else.
4592010	4594995	So that, like, if I want to run...
4595313	4599581	Servers for X Defiant, God forbid, that I could do that.
4599681	4606094	I would never want to, but, you know, that we have the ability to do that is the thing.
4606114	4609480	So the fact that they're making this argument is just stupid.
4610001	4615532	Even if it's provided as an offline peer-to-peer or something, I don't know.
4615512	4620840	The fact that they're saying games don't last forever, that's an incorrect statement.
4621301	4634140	We literally see gaming museums and Atari 2600 cartridges still work in Atari 2600 if the hardware works, but even then you have newer devices once those patents run out that are still able to run those games.
4634220	4641190	Those games will last a very, very, very long time, much longer than the scope of this.
4641471	4643173	So games do last forever.
4643153	4644154	I'm going to use forever.
4644174	4644695	I'm quoting fingers.
4644715	4646337	Games last forever if you want them to.
4646697	4650983	But the problem is you designed this game to not be something that lasts forever.
4651003	4657091	And you're trying to use legalese to justify that, you know, well, we made it and we said we were going to pull the switch.
4657431	4661576	Well, again, I'm going to go back to basically the same argument I made a few weeks ago.
4661977	4665381	There needs to be – if they are going to make us the consumer –
4665361	4684658	Accept these end user license agreements with no pushback or nothing, then it is time for us to hold the company to a consumer license agreement, which is you are going to support these games for at least X number of days or something along the lines of when you inevitably have to close these games, you need to release certain things to the public.
4685019	4686900	Oh, it's too hard to run a server for this game.
4686920	4688402	Why don't you let us decide that?
4688422	4695368	Because, you know, the modders, the crackers, the people that do all these things to the games,
4695348	4698791	They find ways to run these servers.
4698811	4702876	I was literally playing Phantasy Star Online for GameCube this week.
4704397	4709903	The support for that game got pulled a long time ago, but because Sega was pretty open about, you know what?
4709983	4713626	We pulled the plug on this, but here's if you want to do your own thing, here you go.
4714127	4716109	There's still support for that game all these years later.
4717090	4720994	So don't tell me it can't be done because it's being done.
4721014	4724157	You don't want to put the resources in it because you'd rather lay them off.
4727157	4728019	Yeah, pretty much.
4729722	4732668	But there is some support, though, at least from the government.
4733590	4735755	So I'm going to try to pronounce this name.
4735795	4737418	It is very... It's Romanian.
4738220	4739522	Let's try this.
4741166	4743310	Nicolai...
4744066	4748153	and Stefan... Stefan... I don't know how to pronounce his name.
4748273	4750937	Anyways, Vice President of the Parliament.
4751558	4757928	And basically he says, you know, that he's pledging his full support.
4757948	4766181	And he says, I've voiced support for Stop Killing Games and signed the petition himself and is urging other Europeans to do so as well.
4766742	4768605	And will also...
4768585	4772553	I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative.
4772733	4775278	I signed and will continue to help them.
4775298	4780367	A game once sold belongs to the customer, not the company.
4780387	4781449	Great.
4781469	4782311	I'd love to see that.
4782632	4783894	Stefaniota?
4784971	4785812	Sure.
4786232	4791438	It's nice to see gamers, because you said he himself signed this petition, right?
4791458	4796384	It's nice to see gamers like that actually in public office.
4796824	4797385	You know why?
4797425	4802571	It's because these politicians, they're not the age of dirt and ash, okay?
4802651	4809679	They are young people that actually understand everything around them and are just dementia-ridden people.
4809878	4812141	Idiots that just follow Fox News.
4812221	4816386	They are not – like the politicians are not superheroes.
4817087	4822754	I mean we can look up to – like I think Barack Obama in particular was an incredible orator and speech giver.
4822894	4825237	He had a very, very good talent for that.
4825498	4830063	But for the most part, most people that are in public office, there is nothing special about them.
4830304	4834469	You, the listener, you, the person listening to this program right now could run for public office.
4834629	4837012	I just told you a story a minute ago about breaking up with my ex.
4837252	4839295	Did you know my ex was a politician?
4839275	4847555	And so, believe you me, if there's one thing I learned from that relationship, it is any fucking idiot can run for office.
4847936	4852828	And if the presidency of this country right now doesn't fucking highlight that for you, I don't know what will.
4853467	4856654	So if you want to affect change and run for office, you sure fucking can.
4857235	4868440	And I think that's how we need to get more of those, you know, voices out there that understand this shit and everything that Loki said, getting the, you know, geriatricary out of there.
4869121	4869923	Um...
4869903	4870584	Interesting.
4870604	4873727	I want to read some of these comments in chat about the Stop Killing Games thing too.
4874388	4882016	QuestBuster says, Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines came out in 2004 and fans still support it with unofficial patches that have actually added content.
4882336	4884418	QuestBuster also pointing out City of Heroes.
4884438	4885820	That was an infamous one.
4885840	4888803	Resurrected on player-run servers and NCSoft gave the blessing.
4889444	4893067	DarkTutsia pointing out old Dreamcast games are online as well.
4893087	4893268	100%.
4893728	4896511	How about all the Ragnarok online servers that still exist?
4896531	4897412	So like...
4897392	4901377	Again, they can go on if you want them to.
4901497	4902639	Right, yeah, yeah.
4902679	4906603	So Ubisoft needs to stop gaslighting all of us that it's not possible.
4906824	4907605	Oh, yeah.
4907685	4914774	Well, the reason why they don't want that stuff to go on is, I mean, one, it is an extra cost for them.
4914794	4920100	They have to develop it with this in mind that it can be decoupled from the internet.
4920120	4920801	Oh, and I can't do that.
4920781	4922964	So there's that.
4923485	4938930	And then the second thing is, oh no, if like the Crew 1 gets fan support and is maintained, then I guess I don't need to buy the Crew 2 or the Crew Motor Fest or whatever other Crew games are coming out because guess what?
4939010	4940292	This one is being updated.
4940632	4943998	They're worried that that type of stuff is going to eat into their profits.
4944639	4948645	Well, I mean, that's what you would think if you were coming to...
4949620	4958351	That's what you would think if you were a company that developed products that aren't worth buying if another product that already is in that franchise exists.
4959333	4974593	That doesn't say much about the product that you're putting out that you feel if someone was to maintain the old one that that would be just fine that we're not adding enough to this brand new one to justify a purchase for you other than, hey, you can't play the old one now.
4975053	4975754	I'm sorry.
4976135	4977256	That's just stupid.
4977857	4977957	Yeah.
4977937	4978478	I don't know.
4979038	4979399	Whatever.
4980020	4980400	All right.
4980420	4981141	Well, let's move on.
4981682	4992895	I want to talk a little bit about, you know, again, we have a story about, you know, job loss and layoffs being attributed to bosses high up on the chain thinking they can use AI to replace everything.
4993696	5000624	And this has to do with King, who, of course, is part of Activision Blizzard, now Microsoft, who made the game Candy Crush.
5001025	5002847	Some impacted staff...
5002827	5006913	Speaking up a little bit, starting to squeak to the press on what's going on.
5007254	5015967	So some reporting out there is indicating that morale is at an all-time low because AI that they have been training is being used to replace them.
5016507	5025561	So in an interview with MobileGamer.biz, an obviously unnamed King staffer said, Most of level design has been wiped.
5025541	5041761	which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating
5042315	5068255	and now folks are saying that morale is now in the gutter not in a good place with that and I'm sure many of you that are using or that are playing Candy Crush probably giving some of this some consideration when you're hearing about this that basically the levels are likely being large part created by AI at this point which is that's unfortunate so
5068690	5073457	I knew it was just a matter of time before people start squeaking about what's going on at these companies.
5075140	5080809	Now just think, maybe you could have trained those people to do something different.
5081269	5082691	Oh well, what do I know?
5084715	5085215	Let's move on.
5085235	5085696	DarkSakura?
5089442	5091144	So how about some Nintendo stuff?
5091445	5092106	How's that sound?
5092426	5092807	Much better?
5092887	5094850	We do like Nintendo most of the time.
5095808	5101096	Well, there is a second secret Switch Online playtest.
5102738	5109628	Apparently, there's going to be... It's top secret and it's related to a service for Nintendo Switch Online.
5110209	5117039	There's room for 40,000 applicants with it taking place from July 28th to August 10th.
5118422	5121266	Apparently, they're expecting to go really quickly.
5122187	5122828	And...
5124445	5150166	but um from leaks from the last one that it looked like a Minecraft-ish MMO of course you know even with NDAs people talk about it right away of course they do um and of course Nintendo had a field day taking down all of the screenshots and stuff that they could find but um but yeah so you have to have uh an active top tier Nintendo Switch Online plus expansion pack subscription um
5150146	5159358	As of July 17th, be over 18 and be in Japan, US, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Brazil, or Mexico.
5160299	5163363	Open to both Switch and Switch 2 users.
5163383	5166807	And you can fill it off in a form.
5166827	5167769	And you just have it.
5168229	5170592	Actually, it needed to have already been turned in.
5170612	5172174	It closed two days ago.
5173015	5176660	Well, I wonder if anybody we know will get in that.
5178057	5178758	Let us know.
5178778	5179639	But don't tell us anything.
5179659	5180540	Don't break the NDA.
5180861	5181782	No, tell us everything.
5181802	5182443	We'll keep it a secret.
5183704	5185827	I'm covering everybody's butts.
5187349	5197382	But in all seriousness, to what we were saying earlier about trying to enhance some of these online subscriptions and so forth,
5197362	5215532	If Nintendo is working on some sort of massively multiplayer thing, whatever this turns out to be, you know, whether it's just all rumor or what, it certainly does make me think like, huh, if they're to add, this would be like Microsoft Game Pass, including a World of Warcraft subscription, which it really should at this point.
5215552	5217075	But I digress.
5217055	5229196	But if Nintendo cooks up some sort of like must play online thing that is included with a Nintendo Switch online, it's going to make that look a lot better because I think right now a lot of people kind of resent that subscription because what do you get with it?
5229236	5233083	Some classic games and like, oh, you have to have it to play Mario Kart online.
5233103	5235587	I think some other things to sort of sweeten the deal a little bit.
5235567	5265574	I think it would be very welcome
5265554	5271742	That... It's a big part of... The perception is the truth.
5272483	5275326	And that is included when it comes to advertising.
5276067	5278310	What the perception is is going to be your truth.
5279351	5284558	And maybe Nintendo did not create the best perception around that game no matter how good it is.
5284578	5287822	And that's why people are saying they should have just thrown it in for free.
5287842	5288763	So, I don't know.
5288783	5290786	Just something to chew on.
5290806	5293189	So... Alright.
5293209	5294751	Anyhow...
5295220	5299213	Loki, do you want to tell us about the latest in Subnautica world?
5299454	5302885	And if that game is ever going to come out, quite frankly, at this point?
5303253	5304255	I don't know.
5304395	5306179	They're in a lawsuit, obviously.
5306199	5313392	We heard about that last week, that the pseudo-co-founders have filed a lawsuit against Krafton.
5314394	5326577	Apparently, of course, they tried to sabotage the early access release of the game, avoiding to have to pay the $250 million bonus.
5326760	5328764	in the name of its bottom line.
5329485	5339925	But they basically, it's according to the co-founders, they've thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of its creators in the community.
5340952	5368984	More stuff about the lawsuit came out though, and they basically are talking about, kind of going into more details about that, how it says that they alleged that ramping up efforts by Krafton to delay Subnautica 2's land 2025 release in order to avoid triggering its provision from the October 2021 sale that would lead to a $250 million bonus payout if certain sales goals were met through early 2026.
5368964	5385469	During the first week of April 2025, Underworld's publishing colleagues in Krafton basically traveled to Korea to finalize marketing and advertising strategies for Subnautica 2's launch.
5385810	5397908	Upon their return, the team said that the leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead how it could convince Underworld to delay their game.
5398023	5405535	and then basically there's some conclusions of the lawsuit and then Krafton did make a response to it as well.
5405595	5415631	It says in short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and spirit of the contract, promised the very core agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds.
5416352	5420639	It was promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the founders.
5420659	5421360	Promise is broken.
5421380	5425887	It promised to consult with the founders before taking any action.
5425867	5427689	that could harm the earnout.
5428349	5445886	And then their response, of course, was, you know, Krafton's decisions were to ensure that Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to its expectations, releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what the fans expected in a sequel.
5445926	5452212	So what they're complaining or making the argument with is that, well, the game wasn't up to snuff.
5452192	5453214	I mean, I don't know.
5453836	5456362	We're not going to know how it is.
5456382	5463237	But then again, also at the same time, I get that, but also the AAA games come out unfinished as well.
5463257	5467888	So I don't know if that's necessarily the argument that you think it is nowadays.
5467868	5475799	This is while we're disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court.
5475819	5484912	In the meantime, Crafted remains focused on what matters, delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica fans.
5484932	5486895	Somehow I don't believe them, but I don't know.
5486915	5487936	We'll see how it plays out.
5492894	5496241	I can barely follow all this shit anymore, what's going on, to be quite honest.
5496261	5499167	So I just kind of sit here going, is it going to happen or not?
5499187	5500309	It's basically the two sides.
5500450	5506963	One side's saying that, oh, well, they're only asking to delay the game because they don't want to pay us $250 million.
5507023	5514058	And the other company's like, no, no, no, we're saying it because your game isn't good enough to be released in October.
5516873	5517594	Put out a demo.
5517755	5519618	I don't know.
5520339	5528774	It's interesting because I wonder if they won't run it with some test crowds and stuff to sort of gauge, you know, and try to try to have something that makes a little bit more of a definitive decision.
5528794	5534224	They're going to have to put out that evidence or if it's in a court case, they're going to have to present it somehow.
5534204	5553225	Starfield
5553205	5557009	You know, a lot of EA stuff, quite frankly.
5557029	5559191	And Mass Effect Andromeda, I include in that.
5559231	5562715	You know, if it had just been six more months, I don't think it would have gotten half the shit it got.
5563095	5563916	It was a fine game.
5564096	5564877	I still don't think it was that bad.
5565198	5567840	Yeah, at its core, it was a fine game.
5568461	5572525	And I even think Anthem, to some extent, suffered from a similar sort of thing.
5572545	5580073	You know, I think there's a lot of games that just they're rushed to pressure to put out by a certain day and they're not ready to go.
5580053	5595210	Starfield, NotQuiteReady
5596608	5617215	and like as you start off with the game like just being kind of garbage like half half you know ready missing pixels missing things but as you progress through the game you find the things that are missing and implement them and then you start over and you get to that point find more stuff loop around start over
5618258	5631407	until you have the full game and the name like shifts a little bit every time so like so not ready to getting better to kind of not ready to I need five more minutes you know
5632838	5655572	Interesting, so sort of like a game that's meta, because I feel like it's sort of at its core you're defining a Metroidvania a bit, where you're finding items to progress to different parts of the game, but you're talking about something that's a little bit more like a literal sort of loop, where you actually get...
5656042	5657243	Alan just dropped a present.
5657283	5663510	He dropped me just a handful because I can have very many of little nerd gummy clusters because we all know these things are crack, right?
5663710	5665192	I don't like them.
5665212	5676163	But anyway, but something where it's like very meta where it's like the game and the character and the actual rules itself are what is kind of changing every time you restart.
5676323	5677425	I don't want it to be an idle game.
5677445	5680528	It needs to be an active game because it needs to be frustrating at the beginning.
5681309	5685373	You go to like, you know that what you need is on the other side of this door
5685927	5689153	But you get the door and the door mechanics aren't programmed in.
5691479	5719444	and so you have to find like a glitch wall to get through to get to that item and then once you have the item then you restart and you have to adventure a little bit further and now the door works and there's a completely different item there or another door on the other side of that door and then you progress through more of the game so it I want it to be an active adventure game all right Jamie we need a storyboard and a pitch let's go I need a programmer dad
5719829	5721611	Do you think we could get Ubisoft to publish it?
5723354	5723954	Fuck that.
5724515	5725817	Alright, let's move on.
5726317	5727359	I like that AJ twist.
5727379	5729582	You find a gear item and it says you found the menu.
5730342	5730963	Yeah, okay.
5731504	5731804	Okay.
5732285	5732525	Okay.
5733046	5734788	Interesting.
5735529	5741236	My thought would be the menu's there, but if you try to use the sort option, it deletes items or something.
5743239	5746343	So the programming of it is all wrong.
5746913	5759939	You have found this piece of code that actually fixes this.
5759979	5761783	You found patch A.
5761915	5763738	You know, something like that.
5764079	5765040	Storyboard and a pitch.
5765541	5767785	Oh my god, Nat.
5767845	5768345	No.
5769247	5773955	SSJ100Mask says now pretend this game was a car and make it a buggy game.
5774736	5776018	Oh, a buggy game.
5777641	5777941	Alright.
5779023	5779624	Moving on.
5781367	5781928	We did that.
5782108	5784091	That was our game jam.
5784372	5785273	Was a buggy game.
5786063	5787526	Oh, I'm sorry, I was thinking of Time to Car.
5788829	5789390	That was it.
5789751	5791835	Anyway, let's move on.
5791955	5795202	Time to price our games appropriately.
5795282	5802837	Square Enix was talking about Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D Remake, which of course is coming out very soon.
5802877	5805102	I think that's out October 30th.
5805082	5822719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5822800	5845821	and DarkSakura.
5846543	5848706	So they're being very clear on that.
5848786	5856096	But if you actually see the little slide out there on this, you cannot actually upgrade it.
5856116	5860242	There's an FAQ that's on the Japanese site for the series is where this actually is.
5860262	5867112	You can play the Switch 1 version on the Switch 2, of course, because the Switch 2 does play that backwards compatible.
5867132	5875403	But if you want a Switch 2 version that meets the Switch 2 specs, you have to buy that version because it is separate from Switch 1.
5875670	5892750	Of course it is.
5892730	5919683	if people had the confidence oh I haven't invested in a Switch 2 yet but if I pick this up on Switch I'll be able to upgrade it later if people had that confidence like they could have with Nintendo games or certain other games that are out there if they could have that confidence they're probably more likely to buy them early they're not going to do it with this game if you're on the Switch so I'm not sure what they think they're going to get out of it but alright at least they're being transparent about it
5922076	5922818	I reckon.
5924424	5929520	Let's take a trip down memory lane at a time where we didn't have to worry about upgrades and all that good stuff.
5930243	5931106	Roll the bumper.
5931427	5934617	I'm ready to just get to the next segment.
5944857	5952708	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5952728	5955752	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5956994	5959257	And such a good game you picked this week, DarkSakura.
5959758	5961020	I know this one very well.
5961601	5962642	Oh, I love this game.
5962782	5963223	You do?
5963243	5970734	I don't really like it that much, but a lot of people were playing it and I did play it, so I brought it up.
5970894	5972136	Alright, what is it?
5972917	5973818	Satan's Hollow.
5975485	5977427	Who doesn't like a game that says Satan?
5979029	5982734	It is a game by Bally Midway that came out in 1982.
5982774	5984796	It is a fixed shooter.
5985597	5995068	It uses like a flight controller type joystick that has a trigger, same way as Tron actually, and it came out the same year that Tron did.
5996190	5997711	I'm almost positive it's the same hardware.
5998773	5999974	Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
6000275	6010870	But anyway, you have to shoot demons that are attacking while there is an attempt to build a bridge to the next screen.
6011691	6014234	And you have to fight a fire-breathing devil head.
6014254	6016517	And there are definitely ports of this.
6016557	6017519	We will get to that.
6017599	6019041	Actually, there was port of it.
6019361	6020843	Other ports planned, but port.
6021484	6022586	Guess what it was for, Rob?
6024128	6024989	That Commodore 64?
6025009	6025810	Yeah.
6026448	6027656	Yeah!
6027736	6029327	You got it!
6029347	6030716	You knew King of Fighters!
6030736	6031783	I'm so smart.
6032540	6036485	For the record, it was the Midway MCR2 system.
6037166	6046797	Anyway, they are a formation of gargoyles and you have to pick up the pieces of a bridge that has to be built over a river of lava.
6047418	6050442	And once the bridge is completed, then you can go face Satan.
6051143	6060454	Then you have to kill him and then you get more points and then you gotta fight more gargoyles and build an even longer bridge and fight Satan again.
6060940	6082932	and then it gets dark and you have trouble seeing the enemies and then it gets light again but they throw exploding eggs I can only imagine what that would be like in real life if the rocks destroy parts of the bridge for those watching on Twitch we just killed Satan time and space is saved
6083705	6107907	Tilt gave it a 4 out of 6 stars in 1983.
6109220	6113224	So yes, there was a Commodore 64 port.
6113625	6123715	There was an Atari 8-bit computer and Atari 5200 versions that were completed and advertised by CVS Software, but they were never released.
6124316	6130763	Now that I know there's a 5200 prototype about this, I kind of have to have it to go with my other 5200 prototypes.
6132425	6133606	We've got the Tempest prototype.
6134147	6134887	Nice.
6134907	6135548	It's fun.
6135528	6139592	But anyway, it was included in the Midway Arcade Treasures collection.
6139612	6143816	It came out in 2003 for PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox.
6143836	6146359	And also in 2004 for Windows.
6146739	6149742	And that's where I found this game, by the way, was that collection.
6149782	6152385	It was how I learned about this game, to be honest.
6152405	6152545	Okay.
6153226	6159432	It was also included in the Midway Arcade Origins collection that came out in 2012 for PS3 and Xbox 360.
6159913	6160994	And that's the game.
6161614	6164337	I wonder, could it be Satan?
6167742	6168763	Thank you, Church Lady.
6169044	6170746	All right, there it is.
6170766	6173670	Your classic game of the week, Satan's Hollow.
6173690	6174070	All right.
6174651	6175192	What did I get?
6175232	6178056	Did I speedrun that well enough, or did I just slow walk it again?
6179558	6183243	I just noticed how the pit of fire gets bigger and bigger with each stage.
6183283	6187488	I guess I forgot that was... I must not have been very good at this game, which honestly wouldn't surprise me.
6187508	6188950	So... What?
6189571	6190833	What?
6191213	6191434	What?
6191714	6192535	The floor is lava.
6193358	6193678	Ow.
6194179	6194499	All right.
6195300	6198583	Thank you very much for your inspiration.
6198603	6199544	Jesus Christ, what?
6201466	6207853	The power of Satan compels you.
6207953	6209214	All right, that's it.
6209234	6209915	Let's move on.
6209995	6212497	That's a completely different power that compels me.
6213758	6214719	Rapid fire news.
6214739	6219744	Let's talk about some news quicker than, I don't know, I can tank the show with another transition.
6219784	6220345	Loki.
6222113	6224578	Except you will have to turn on your volume switch, Loki.
6224618	6225540	Movie announcements.
6225580	6227123	We're going to talk about... I mimed it first.
6227163	6228867	I just wanted to show you the cinema.
6229408	6240932	Anyways, so we have movie announcements regarding some updates on the Zelda movie and also a potential Donkey Kong movie.
6240912	6245036	So the Zelda movie, it was made announcement by Miyamoto.
6245056	6249000	They had they have the two lead roles already figured out.
6249520	6252303	So Link is not Timothy Chalamet.
6252724	6254205	It is not Timothy Chalamet.
6254645	6261672	Never was going to be portrayed by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who was in Pinocchio.
6262633	6267578	And Bo Bo Bragason is going to be Princess Zelda.
6267845	6278163	I don't know who they are, but that sounds cool.
6278263	6280627	I like unknowns.
6280908	6284254	Not household names.
6285115	6288942	How about little known?
6288922	6296457	Yeah, it's just, that's always the direction this was going to go in because Timothee Chalamet is too old.
6296477	6299122	These characters are supposed to be, what, 21 tops?
6299764	6304413	So, you know, they were always going to be young, you know, young folks.
6304433	6307118	In Breath of the Wild, Zelda literally turned, what, 17?
6307138	6307960	Yeah.
6307940	6328007	Jack Black is getting...
6327987	6351075	sure Jack Black as Ganon or maybe like an Impa as a very well-known you know uh actress or something we have Chris Pratt there's there's a lot of other as Toad there's a lot of support yeah and some folks in chats think that maybe Ganon would be the known actor potentially so why did I say Toad I meant as as
6351562	6352003	Who knows?
6352163	6352444	Who knows?
6352765	6353566	Old man number two.
6354027	6354729	Danny DeVito.
6355651	6357054	God, I hope so.
6357775	6363066	AJ Twist in chat says, every Zelda game is a different link, so if there are more Zelda movies, could there be a different actor?
6363487	6364028	Why not?
6365532	6366253	James Bond?
6367115	6367516	Why not?
6367536	6369520	We've had, what, five James Bonds?
6369770	6374936	Yeah, but they acknowledge it as a different person just using the codename.
6375356	6375997	Yeah.
6376057	6376998	Okay, perfect.
6377018	6379982	That's the same thing for Link then.
6381043	6384106	But I also think we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves.
6384547	6387490	Let's continue to focus on, please let this movie be good.
6387510	6393217	But I don't understand the reactions that people are having to these casting decisions.
6393617	6397041	They were always going to cast young, unknown people.
6397061	6398983	If you thought differently...
6399841	6405808	I guess you don't pay attention to a lot of these sorts of casting things that happen.
6406009	6411576	This is very, very common because these young folks are probably signed on.
6411596	6420066	As much as I like the idea that AJ Twist proposed, I would bet these young actors are signed on for three movies with this.
6420587	6422329	So we'll see.
6422349	6423250	Anyway.
6423230	6424231	Anyways.
6425172	6427275	And then, Donkey Kong.
6427295	6431620	We have word, of course, that there's going to be a Donkey Kong movie.
6432201	6438188	Nintendo and Universal have registered a copyright for the project.
6438208	6439550	It's just a project name right now.
6439690	6444235	Untitled Donkey Kong Project Motion Picture.
6444255	6446438	So, maybe in 2028?
6447199	6451824	With the groundwork they laid down in the movie, the Mario movie, are we surprised?
6451904	6453186	And also, like,
6453368	6456754	Yeah, the groundwork of the movie, the new land.
6457115	6458939	Yeah, I think it's not surprising.
6458959	6461223	Yeah, not surprising at all.
6461243	6465210	So Tiger Class says, I'm curious on who they'd cast for the DK movie.
6465230	6471242	Well, I would assume they're going to keep the principles like they were in the main movie if the contract was signed that way.
6471282	6472204	We'll see.
6472224	6474488	Who would they cast to voice King K. Rool?
6475590	6476592	Danny DeVito.
6477297	6482845	is going to be my answer in perpetuity until he actually does it in a movie.
6482945	6483967	I think he's dead, Jamie.
6484808	6485909	Isn't he?
6485929	6487652	Then they use the AI version of him.
6487672	6489154	No, we hate that.
6490556	6490836	All right.
6490856	6491998	I don't know why I said Gilbert Gottfried.
6492018	6493520	I just think it was funny.
6493540	6496184	All right.
6496965	6497366	Moving on.
6497426	6499609	Oh, Jamie, you have a fast story for us.
6500635	6501398	I do?
6501518	6502401	Yeah, Paprium.
6503726	6505934	The game that everyone loves to be pissed off about.
6507359	6511995	It actually is soon going to be playable on original hardware using an EverDrive.
6513190	6523750	In fact, there is video from Crix, I guess that's how it's pronounced, showing it running through an EverDrive on a Genesis.
6524752	6530964	It looks like that... Hold on, I should have a little bit more about what this is.
6532046	6532347	Um...
6534115	6535256	There we go.
6535276	6542925	A custom Genesis plus GX core for RetroArch has been developed, and it will allow people to play that.
6543025	6552537	So right now, it only works via emulation and can't be played on the original hardware, but they are working it out.
6552817	6559745	And there's video of it actually loading and starting to work, so I think that they're going to be able to get this done.
6559845	6560646	I mean...
6560626	6562288	Honestly, stick it to Watermelon.
6562348	6569078	They took people's money out of two crowdfunding campaigns for Paprium and still didn't deliver.
6569539	6571541	Not really.
6571562	6575968	And the game itself is just... There's even a Kickstarter.
6578612	6584620	Sorry, a campaign going around to secure the money to refund the Paprium Kickstarter.
6586182	6590228	They have a class action actually in the works as well.
6590292	6608368	Alright, well I am very excited Which I really just want to play this game because it looks cool Well, you know I have a version of it I was going to say archive.org I already have my version
6608888	6618881	Well, I know you already have a version of this too, DarkSakura, but I'm still excited about this news, and that is that we're going to have a new table coming to Pinball FX, and it's Pimbot!
6619302	6619822	That's right.
6620263	6621464	Oh yeah, I played that too.
6621484	6634221	Not to be confused with the NES port, this is a legitimate... You know the Pinball FX games, they try to create as accurate a representation of the original consoles, although there are smoke effects, so they're obviously doing some...
6634201	6644973	You know, some different things with this, but it's looking to be a faithful, somewhat recreation of the original Pinball table that is coming out in the Williams Pinball Volume 9.
6645433	6648857	I can't believe there's that many of them, but there are that's coming out for Pinball FX.
6648877	6649938	So that is coming out.
6649958	6652541	Did you know there's 120 tables in Pinball FX at this point?
6652961	6657927	I keep losing track because they reboot this series and all of that.
6657947	6662892	But yeah, they've added shit like Pinball Dancing with the Bride of Pinball, but sure.
6662872	6685842	uh it seems like a lot of that is just kind of that would be nice I would be curious if they would do things like the the color um dot matrix mod and the color you know some of the other like things people don't know the color dmd and all of the sound which you know what I would love is if they did Bride of Pinbot if they did Bride of Pinbot 2.0 even though it's a fan thing
6686750	6687791	I just think that would be fun.
6688352	6694100	And Bobby does say, if you don't like the additional animations, you just flip them off.
6694420	6695562	It's a toggle.
6696423	6704133	Which the original NES version of Pinbot did not have, which was very controversial because aliens did not swallow your balls whole on the original table.
6704653	6707777	Some people would like for aliens to swallow their balls whole, though, Rob.
6709560	6710581	Yeah.
6710601	6712063	Unfortunate that that's been missed.
6712083	6715828	For the record, this is an 18 plus podcast, so...
6716247	6721832	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates while I just sit here and hope the aliens abduct me this week.
6722312	6723874	What can we look forward to playing, Loki?

7072293	7075877	She really pips my dice.
7075897	7078039	It's a very strange name for a game.
7078319	7079380	All right.
7079401	7081783	Well, you know the little dots on dice are pips, right?
7081863	7082564	Yeah, of course I know that.
7082584	7084486	Yeah.
7085927	7086208	Why?
7086228	7088310	It's an interesting expression.
7088330	7089211	Pip my dice.
7089251	7089751	Come on.
7090132	7091293	Jeez, Rob.
7091413	7093135	Pip my ride and pip my dice.
7093295	7093615	All right.
7094396	7100342	Well, speaking of dirty minds, Loki, some of those dirty minds...
7101790	7102915	Loki, read the damn story.
7106891	7111952	So Steam is now... They have to tighten up some of the...
7113907	7127479	They have to tighten up some of the rules regarding adult content on their platform because those wonderful payment processors, those wholesome family-friendly payment processors.
7127700	7132371	I mean, I know whenever I'm thinking of Visa and MasterCard, I think immediately of family.
7133363	7134927	That's immediately what I think about.
7135688	7141461	The fact that they could be sullying... I think about the bill I ran up at the adult fun store.
7142504	7150562	The fact that they could be sullying their name by funding some adult-related products, that's just...
7150542	7151583	Boggles my mind.
7152344	7155609	Then they shouldn't have been a sponsor of WankFest 2025.
7155669	7158994	I'm just going to stop supporting Visa and MasterCard.
7159014	7179722	But apparently, since they are so concerned about that nonsense, they've had to alter the Steam's terms of service, saying that content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processor and related card networks and banks or internet network providers, in particular certain kinds of adult-only content,
7179702	7185167	They may have to, of course, remove your game or alter it or something like that.
7185688	7189932	I like how it doesn't really go into what exactly.
7195217	7196158	Like, what is it?
7196658	7198400	It's just specifically very vague.
7199641	7201443	I lost Discord for just half a second.
7201463	7203425	So that audio pause wasn't just you all listening.
7203485	7203725	Sorry.
7203745	7204025	I don't know.
7204165	7205306	Just weird Internet blip.
7205326	7206047	Sorry, Loki.
7206972	7210978	Yeah, so they're not really saying what exactly it is.
7211719	7219249	Some of the stuff is obviously adult content that isn't appropriately labeled and age-gated.
7219650	7221773	Obviously, they can't distribute that.
7222835	7230145	But yeah, it doesn't really break down as what is that you can't do now that you could have done earlier.
7230952	7246682	it's just certain themes whatever that the card processors think that they want to censor I guess let's give them all the control over it, sure I don't know but yeah, it's kind of
7248164	7276652	it's annoying any policy that's intentionally vague so that they can switch it on a whim for whatever they need it to especially when it comes to censorship or we deal a lot of this on YouTube and stuff they're changing rules all the time without any sort of explanation I don't know if I mentioned it last week but YouTube had sent out to a bunch of creators a thing saying hey we're going to remove your advanced features on your channel
7276902	7279125	Implying that you did something wrong.
7279590	7280095	Now...
7281273	7282655	We didn't do anything wrong.
7283236	7285558	They just decided to do that because, why?
7285939	7288803	They wanted a copy of your identification.
7289944	7293248	And they claim, well, your channel doesn't have enough history on it.
7293268	7296192	It's like, this channel is like 10 years old.
7296252	7297874	There's like tons of videos on it.
7297894	7299456	What do you mean there's no history?
7299737	7301118	This isn't a brand new channel.
7301659	7304382	It's an excuse to get something.
7304443	7308748	But the fact that they treat their customers in a way acting like, well...
7308728	7310750	Clearly you did something criminal.
7310770	7312232	It's like, okay, well, what is it that I did?
7312472	7314073	Well, it's probably on this list.
7314093	7315895	And if it's on this list, we may have made a mistake.
7315935	7318077	But we're never going to cop to the fact that we made a mistake.
7318358	7319939	You probably did something on this list.
7319999	7322021	It's like, well, I didn't do anything on that list.
7322041	7323223	Show me where I did something.
7323283	7323883	Well, we can't.
7323903	7324724	But here's the list.
7325164	7326205	Because AI shut it down.
7326366	7327267	AI found it.
7327327	7327787	Yeah, right.
7327887	7329949	That's what's happening to Facebook accounts.
7330370	7331551	People are getting Facebook deleted.
7331851	7332392	Oh, AI.
7332772	7334073	Can I have an appeal?
7334374	7334834	AI decided no.
7334854	7335715	It's been happening.
7335695	7340728	With certain things uploaded on TikTok, however, they've been pretty good about their review process.
7341590	7347205	Because I put up something for Mass Effect and it said that it was a copyright violation.
7347406	7348649	And I'm like, no, it's not.
7348970	7350193	And they said, okay, it's not.
7352165	7353086	Okay, don't hurt us.
7354448	7379455	So I was going to make a joke here about things you can use your Visa or MasterCard on, and then I realized I'm not on my personal channel, I'm on the VOG Network channel, so I'm not going to show my other screen, but I will simply point out that if you go to Amazon.com, and I would advise you to do this in an incognito window, and you search for fetish table, you're going to get a table called a milking table for men that has a hole cut out
7379637	7388048	Thank God I'm aced.
7389250	7408615	Alright.
7409573	7413078	Artie McPhier says, I could comment on that, but not gonna.
7413098	7414800	I wasn't looking for comments.
7414820	7416202	Oh, Artie, of course you could.
7416703	7417464	Of course you could.
7417644	7418946	I'm just saying.
7419166	7420108	It's interesting.
7420608	7423352	Oh, by the way, PodCulture says, should have been 690.
7424053	7425996	We got a comedian in the house.
7426016	7427498	We got a comedian in the house.
7428777	7429901	All right.
7429961	7431807	With that, let's go to the listener roundtable.
7431827	7433172	I know we have emails tonight.
7433232	7435238	Participate at OrangeOnTrader.com.
7435539	7437406	We have exactly two.
7437486	7440255	Hey, that's two more than we got last week, so let's get to it.
7440758	7463644	I don't have enough soda for this okay um anyway one clearly comes from before California Extreme so um I will start off hello all our friends it's Mari um I will likely not be listening live this Sunday since I'll be attending both days of California Extreme and I look forward to seeing Jamie if she's reading this before then so I'll catch up later via podcast
7463624	7465728	Yes, we hung out a couple of times.
7465768	7466349	It was wonderful.
7467071	7483742	And on the subject of things that are closely tied to classic games, which in my millennial mind means stuff made before the Dreamcast, I think about why the shoot-em-up genre known as shmups, top-down shooters, side-scrolling shooters, are so difficult for folks to get into, especially younger folks.
7483722	7496247	and if you call all of them bullet hell even the shmups that don't have dense and pretty patterns on the screen I will likely I will make like an MIRC user and trout you slash joke that's a throwback a lot of
7496817	7507512	A lot of folks will say that shmups are too difficult, especially those who were introduced to the genre through Toho Project and immediately got put off by Bullet Vomit, trademark.
7508253	7516765	While I feel like that's certainly one aspect of it, I also feel like another part of why shmups are a niche at best these days is because of the structure of these games.
7516785	7525778	The vast majority of shmups take you through 5-10 stages each a few minutes long on an adventure that's typically 20-60 minutes long before seeing the credits.
7525758	7532928	That was a standard back in the 80s and 90s, but nowadays the paradigm shifts in the gaming industry forever changing how games are developed and how they're structured.
7533468	7535591	It's seen as an outdated relic by most gamers.
7535812	7547327	Many gamers these days want games that are hours-long adventures, and the fact that their website's like howlongtobeat.com shows how much gamers seem to value their games being sufficiently long.
7547307	7558743	So even if shmups did have the super easy modes so that many people insist they have, they still wouldn't sell because people would just give them a quick run through and never think about the games ever again.
7559504	7565653	Being a hard game hasn't stopped games like Dark Souls from selling like hotcakes and inventing a new genre in the process.
7565753	7572302	My goodness, when Elden Ring came out, it drowned out other game discussion in so many of my usual communities for about a week.
7572282	7583322	Sure, they may have a reputation for being less frustrating, but they still have a lot to the modern game tropes that make them appealing to anyone who isn't rarebrained like me.
7583572	7590479	And one of the shmup-focused discords I'm in, shmups that are good for new players, is a topic that comes up every now and then.
7590500	7599189	And I try to push for games like Zero Ranger and Dryness because they certainly still have the shmup DNA in them.
7599269	7602152	They adapt some of the tropes of more modern games like storytelling.
7602613	7606677	This isn't just one-line aliens are taking over the Earth blurb in the manual.
7606657	7608960	The ability to save where you left off.
7609141	7615330	In the case of Dranus in particular, a game that is nearly two hours long and allows the player to buy new weapons and swap them out by pausing.
7616211	7628530	I feel like introducing some of the tropes of more conventional games is a better way to make these kind of games more palatable than just having a mode where enemies only shoot bullets every 15 seconds and where you have unlimited lives.
7628510	7639265	Of course, that's no guarantee that those games will sell well, and it's the best I can hope for without having a game that's completely unlike the traditional shmup mold, like Vampire Saviors.
7640107	7653966	While I would love to have more of my friends get into these kind of games, at the end of the day, this is a genre that has stood the test of time, and while it may never become mainstream ever again, it still has a steady and dedicated community, and shmups still get released several times a year.
7654207	7655689	I am glad enough for that.
7655749	7657892	Anyway, thank you for reading until next time.
7657872	7660061	Screenshot that says, Shooting games never die.
7660162	7663696	Praying that the lucky clover will always be in your heart.
7664279	7666026	With love, Mari Clarity.
7666563	7692435	interesting email because yeah you're right shmups is one of those genres that I feel like a lot of the new releases kind of get thrown into the niche bin I can't think of a lot of like mainstream releases we get but obviously you know a lot of those games I think you should kind of point out they don't always seem super easily accessible to a new crowd although there are certain ones that you know like you kind of illustrated there some good like intro sorts of games um
7692415	7696061	Try not to be offended what I'm about to say as a fan of the genre.
7696642	7705618	I think one thing that makes shmups very hard to explain to new people, the intricacies of the different shmups, is that a lot of them look very samey at first glance.
7705698	7710887	And I realize they're not all samey, and you have to kind of take that deeper look to see some of that.
7710907	7715976	But a lot of, I think, shmups to the average viewer...
7715956	7717258	look a little bit samey.
7717278	7723567	I think that's why something like an Ikaruga, you know, has been released as 11 billion times like it has.
7723647	7725090	And over, yeah.
7725110	7736887	Yeah, because that whole polarity switching, right, was a very different thing for the genre that made people look and go, oh, this is really different.
7736907	7740452	And, you know, I think is one reason why, you know, and it was just a damn good game.
7740893	7743617	I think it's a reason why people, you know, look at that.
7743597	7764897	And I realized you could use the-
7764877	7768181	And to be fair, again, because I'm not trying to be... I'm not trying to offend.
7768201	7770063	I'm just trying to say, like, look from this perspective.
7770524	7773547	I would say this exact same thing would be true of the fighting game genre.
7773567	7777192	And I think there's a lot of people that would take issue with me saying that.
7777212	7782158	But again, to the average person, I think a lot of fighting games look very samey.
7782178	7783960	And what's the thing that really distinguishes it?
7783980	7787784	Obviously, there's a lot of the intricacies and the controls and the mechanics in that regard.
7787804	7790388	3D versus 2D, the characters.
7790408	7792470	But again, look at a lot of the big...
7792450	7792951	Yes!
7793051	7813480	Yes!
7813460	7819049	Overwatch is different because, again, that's why they lean so hard to try to make distinguishable characters.
7819069	7822995	But then when we had a Concord, well, we see how that went.
7823015	7824398	And then, of course, again, Marvel.
7824738	7832751	Marvel rivals doing very well in that genre for a new kid on the block because of its instantly recognizable characters and those sorts of things.
7832950	7854182	Dragon Spirit Dragon Spirit
7854162	7854623	That's it.
7854723	7858869	I'm getting mixed up with the Super Nintendo Kimco game that I was talking about on another thing.
7859149	7860571	Yes, Dragon Spirit.
7860591	7862534	Because it's kind of different because you're a dragon.
7862574	7863375	It's kind of neat.
7863696	7864076	I love it.
7865098	7868763	I've shown you Psychic Storm for PC Engine.
7869123	7870405	Mm-hmm.
7870425	7873029	Or even my beloved Star Parodia.
7873690	7873850	Mm-hmm.
7875052	7880299	Where you're playing as either Twinbee or a flying PC Engine.
7880840	7880980	Mm-hmm.
7882175	7888462	And I know it's cliche, but one place I really like to start with shmups is Life Force or Salamander.
7888522	7891606	Like obviously that game, you know, got a lot of releases and different tweaks.
7891987	7896432	But I love that concept of like flying through a human body for like a shooter game.
7896452	7897173	It's just really cool.
7897733	7899115	I love that series.
7899876	7900076	All right.
7900096	7900817	Anyway, great email.
7902599	7902699	Yeah.
7902719	7904261	So the last one.
7904281	7904662	Hi, y'all.
7904682	7905883	This is NoOneSpecial77.
7906243	7907164	Long time no see.
7907245	7908486	Sorry, I haven't been around.
7909681	7910822	But things have been chaotic.
7910903	7914948	At any rate, in this email, I'd like to address a subject that may affect some folks in the community.
7914968	7916890	I'm not sure if you had already addressed this.
7917071	7917892	Maybe, maybe not.
7919334	7922538	In short, it appears that as of this past Friday, Microsoft is officially retired.
7922738	7923499	Yeah, we talked about this.
7923779	7928285	It's a video game service on Windows and consoles.
7928666	7935655	While people can still access previously purchased... Oh, he's got some weird typos in here.
7935635	7964663	... ... ... ... ... ...
7965453	7990549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7990529	8000556	And now that this email's coming in, I remember when he went by a different monkey or Ragenator or whatever, I remember he would talk about... I thought he bought them on PlayStation as well.
8000616	8001999	Maybe I'm mixing that up a little bit.
8002420	8005669	But I remember him talking about...
8005649	8008852	using this to buy movies and TV shows and stuff.
8008872	8012757	And yeah, I can imagine how incredibly frustrating this is.
8012777	8022527	And even though you're still gonna have access to the archive for now, and hopefully for a long time, let's say it is a TV show and it's a newer TV show.
8022547	8026992	Let's say it's, oh, I don't know, Star Trek, Strange New Worlds, humor me here.
8027012	8034880	And maybe you have the first couple seasons that have already come out, but now the new season, you're gonna have to go to a new service to get that.
8034860	8038844	You're not going to be able to buy that episode by episode on Xbox.
8038904	8043588	And now you're going to have split locations for your different seasons of that TV show.
8044029	8044810	That sucks.
8044850	8045971	That's annoying as fuck.
8046631	8054459	And now you're going to have to contend with the thought that Paramount agreed with a certain president to pay him off because of some phony lawsuit.
8054819	8058203	And then Stephen Colbert's show is cancelled now because of that.
8058223	8060825	That's a whole other Oprah, but yes.
8061886	8062547	And there's that.
8063448	8063888	Um...
8065336	8074373	So yeah, we got into it pretty much earlier in the show, but I appreciate hearing from your perspective as somebody who is very much impacted by this news.
8074393	8078541	And I can't imagine having a good time hearing about this, so I'm sorry to hear it.
8078561	8080185	But I will be curious.
8080265	8082770	He said Amazon, he's already considering switching.
8082790	8084593	I'm curious where he's going now.
8085417	8103037	I was remembering when we were talking about platforms like how Steam should sell movies like that I think my friend turned me on to Vudu as an option like that They sell a lot of old movies for dirt cheap sometimes through their digital platform Isn't Vudu the Walmart owned one?
8104179	8110446	I think so That makes sense, they have a virtual $5 DVD bin Alright
8111962	8112763	All right.
8113544	8119975	Well, if you would like to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send an email.
8120275	8127326	And thank you to Dark Tetsuya for reminding me that he had sent something on Blue Sky, and you can follow us on Blue Sky.
8127346	8131613	Oh, the name of Voodoo changed to Fandango at Home, I guess through a series of acquisitions.
8131633	8132214	Oh, that's correct.
8132254	8132735	That's right.
8132775	8133236	Yes, yes.
8133436	8133977	My mistake.
8133997	8134618	I forgot about that.
8134758	8135780	I didn't know that.
8135800	8138003	Do they do the Fandango with your credit card?
8138185	8139987	and Spandango.
8140909	8143432	I remember those commercials with the paper bag people.
8144133	8145094	Hey, BlueSky.
8146096	8149180	You can follow us on BlueSky at our domain, Orangelandradio.com.
8149200	8152104	BlueSky allows you to use your domain as your username to show verification.
8152544	8164680	So we are on BlueSky at Orangelandradio.com and DarkTetsuya sent us a message and I did want to address this saying, so I was watching one of my favorite retro game YouTubers and apparently he was a guest at a new convention out in Sacramento.
8165121	8166623	I don't know if any of y'all have heard of it,
8166603	8168665	But from what I've seen, it sounded really cool.
8168685	8171768	And it was a thing called... It's like a Sacramento GamesCon, isn't it?
8172229	8173010	No, it's not that.
8173050	8173810	That's a different one.
8173870	8176994	This is the Fire and Ice RGX, Roseville Gamers Expo.
8177014	8177494	Yes, yes.
8178135	8179216	I've heard of that.
8179236	8180597	I know what Fire and Ice is, yeah.
8180697	8183680	Yeah, I've heard of the store.
8183821	8188946	I haven't been there yet, but I've definitely driven by it because wasn't that the one that used to be a religious, like it was a Christian bookstore?
8189246	8191108	And now it's a gamer store, which I think is really funny.
8191088	8211460	it may have been, it's also no, I'm sorry that's Fired Up Esports Lounge very similar name, sorry but there is also a store called Fire and Ice out there in that area which is like a retro Fire and Ice retro games or whatever and they also have what was it, there's
8213228	8214270	Yeah, there's two locations now.
8214290	8218217	They just opened one over by the old Chuck E. Cheese and Citrus Heights.
8219480	8221123	It's over there.
8221143	8221784	Like Cusar?
8223447	8225731	Well, Cusar used to be a long time ago.
8225751	8226392	Holy shit.
8227394	8231362	Yeah, that is dead is dead.
8232023	8232584	So dead.
8233566	8234207	Um...
8234643	8245863	What I was going to say... Yeah, they did... So they basically have combined forces with the folks that do the... It's like a Sacramento Game Expo that's like every December or so.
8246504	8248227	That's all the SAC anime people.
8248248	8249790	They do cons all the time.
8249830	8251513	That's just an offshoot of SAC anime.
8251553	8252415	And I...
8252395	8271045	I've spoken, by the way, recently with people on this, so...
8271025	8294316	Yeah TBD it was when they were at the Red Lion which is now like condos it's not even there anymore so um we yeah we did so anyway yeah we'd love to get back in the circle with this um here's the problem so here's I actually have a very short answer believe it or not even though we've spent a few minutes talking about I have a very short answer as to why I did not check out this convention Dark Tetsuya it was the same weekend as Southern Fried Gaming Expo I wasn't here
8294296	8295017	I was in Atlanta.
8295037	8295878	So it was the same weekend.
8295898	8297020	So that's why I couldn't tell you.
8297060	8298362	Excuses, excuses.
8298382	8299003	Well, whatever.
8299083	8300065	You all could have gone.
8300426	8301006	But anyway.
8301026	8302329	I think I was out of town too.
8302429	8302869	Oh, that's right.
8302889	8303991	You were in San Diego.
8304031	8305093	Well, that leaves one of us.
8305353	8306836	I knew about it.
8306856	8307617	I knew about it.
8307857	8310621	I had a ballet performance.
8310862	8311022	Yeah.
8311002	8340604	so we just we bad weekend for us but we'll keep an eye on it I would like to get involved we really should just pay attention to our schedules when they do this look I'd love to get involved with more gaming cons locally and I don't want to say too much but it's not the same company but they are friends I work a lot with a friend company so I can probably just send a couple emails and see if we can get it to the next one but yeah they just they happen a lot there's one of those gaming things if it's not
8340584	8345854	Really, Rob?
8346656	8363048	FFS.
8363146	8374356	Um, but I will say this next year, um, Southern Fried Gaming Expo is going back to its old time slot at the end of July, early August, which makes it a lot less likely that I'll probably go.
8374757	8381363	Although I will admit I'm sitting here going, I always sit here and go two trips back to back as a bad idea.
8382204	8388329	But now that I'm sitting here like four weeks after Southern Fried is done, I'm like, I could, I could go to Atlanta next weekend if I needed to.
8388830	8390471	Like, it's not that bad.
8390491	8391432	What?
8391614	8392455	There's a solution.
8392775	8393676	What?
8393696	8395718	See if you can telework.
8396159	8397140	Yes, I telework all the time.
8397220	8398481	I could telework in another – No.
8399463	8403187	Yeah, and just work from wherever you're staying.
8403427	8404848	I don't want to get into it too much.
8405069	8410094	I can sometimes do those things in a limited capacity, although usually there has to be like a reason.
8410294	8412637	But anyway, I'm not going to get too much into it further.
8412817	8412937	Okay.
8413798	8414899	I'm just saying I'm throwing it out there.
8415039	8415440	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8415460	8416761	No, I get it.
8417302	8417402	Okay.
8417787	8420330	So what else do I want to say on all that?
8421030	8422412	Oh, but next, here's the thing.
8422472	8428118	Specifically next year, Alan and I are looking at doing a cruise in early August.
8428138	8432743	So that's a hard no on Southern Fried because of the time frame.
8432763	8434685	If we do the cruise.
8434705	8436967	But right now we are waitlisted for said cruise.
8437368	8440531	So if we do not get through the waitlist, never say never.
8441192	8444015	So we'll see what happens.
8444115	8444395	All right.
8445116	8446157	I guess that's it.
8446711	8448854	Thank you for your messages on Blue Sky.
8448895	8451479	Thank you for your messages that participate at OrangeLondrina.com.
8451839	8452741	I think we're ready to wrap things up.
8452761	8455485	We're actually running a little longer than we usually do, but we've had a lot to say.
8456267	8462216	And it's refreshing to be back in that two to three hour time frame for this program where we have a lot to say.
8462336	8464199	But it is time to wrap it up and head out for the night.
8464600	8468567	So let's go around and get everybody... Actually, first, let me check on last minute stories from Loki.
8468587	8469909	You might have a thing or two.
8469949	8470389	I do.
8470650	8471852	And this is a doozy.
8472433	8473274	Oh, shit.
8473294	8473815	So...
8474268	8482818	So, PAL World, Nintendo, their whole lawsuit is still ongoing, but there's an interesting little thing that's happened.
8483058	8487543	Apparently, Nintendo, and how is this even possible?
8487904	8488605	I don't even know.
8490227	8502621	So, during the lawsuit, the patents that they are saying that PAL World is infringing upon, Nintendo is changing those while...
8502905	8522938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8523492	8524694	After the fact?
8524714	8527759	Like, that seems illegal to me.
8527819	8532205	It wouldn't have any standing because it has to be based off the verbiage at the time of the release.
8532286	8534088	Well, I mean, I don't know they're doing it, though.
8534128	8542101	It says the company has changed the language behind one of its patents during the middle of the ongoing lawsuit.
8542922	8550073	Apparently, Nintendo wanted to change their patent regarding the smooth switching of writing objects.
8550053	8555520	Such as moving from flying to an avian creature to another land-based mount.
8555540	8562649	They said Nintendo's patent update added far more language without changing the core technical terms used in its copyright.
8563370	8573523	What is kind of confusing is the fact that they used the inclusion of the language even when statement, which is very unusual for patents.
8573543	8578069	It says the deliberate use of even could be Nintendo's attempt to make their patent
8578049	8594704	I've been following the patent litigation for 15 years, for the better part of that period as a consultant, and I have seen many claims that were amended, but I've never seen even when or even if in a patent claim.
8594724	8596007	It's bizarre.
8596612	8604204	And, um, yeah, it says the overly long paragraph in the use of subjective terms might be getting thrown up as a shield.
8605165	8606648	Um, so I don't know.
8607269	8610353	But that's, it's interesting to see them kind of tweaking that.
8610433	8619227	I don't know if it's some sort of way to try to, you know, expand the coverage of this lawsuit, or is it just...
8620152	8623878	They're doing routine updates and it just happens to co-assign during this lawsuit.
8624078	8624418	I don't know.
8624479	8626161	I don't trust Nintendo in this case.
8627123	8631569	It feels really shady in the first place to be even suing Palworld at this point.
8631930	8637358	Sue them on stealing the designs of your characters, but the game mechanics?
8637678	8640743	I don't like the idea that you're even patenting game mechanics.
8640993	8654007	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
8658932	8670865	We're starting with Mass Effect 2 instead of the first Mass Effect, now that I got my save editor working.
8670929	8672954	Alright, so you're doing some Mass Effect tonight.
8674036	8674778	Hell yeah!
8675038	8675720	Alright, enjoy.
8675920	8677304	Have fun.
8677344	8681633	I'm Jamie and this is my favorite Mass Effect on the Mass Effect.
8682776	8683899	Alright, we'll see you in a little bit, Jamie.
8684059	8685061	Always date Garrus.
8685282	8685562	Bye.
8685843	8686204	Bye.
8686825	8688870	Alright, Loki, let's go to your final thought.
8689323	8692847	Hopefully I can get in the right mind space to be able to code this week.
8692907	8694329	That's been the problem last week.
8694409	8700717	It was like taking forever after work, like just brain fried to try to shift gears into coding stuff.
8700737	8704862	Well, you can't just use AI and vibes?
8704882	8705943	No, you can't.
8706063	8713272	AI answers are usually wrong, especially with data packs, because there's so many changes so often.
8714804	8716907	Um, my final thought tonight.
8717788	8718168	I don't know.
8718389	8719970	I don't, I don't have a lot.
8719991	8723375	I just, um, Hmm.
8723675	8725257	I'm thankful I had a three day weekend.
8725457	8727860	I have a new work schedule that allows me to work.
8727880	8730544	I work nine hour days, which is fine.
8730584	8732046	I'm used to it at this point.
8732066	8736111	And I have, um, every other Friday off and it's been quite lovely.
8736131	8737733	I enjoyed my three day weekend.
8737753	8738614	It's nice.
8738634	8739495	So, um,
8739475	8742438	I get more me time.
8742458	8743339	Random trips.
8743359	8743719	I love it.
8743859	8744140	All right.
8744460	8744900	That's it.
8745301	8746142	Have a good week, everybody.
8746162	8751507	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio in seven days to talk about whatever comes up in this next week.
8751967	8757092	Is it true that they'll do a Nintendo Direct right after the Donkey Kong Bonanza release, as all those rumors are saying?
8757533	8758934	We'll find out in seven days.
8759355	8762217	I kind of don't think so, but I'd love to be wrong.
8762238	8762738	Let's see.
8762758	8763599	We'll find out in seven days.
8763639	8766422	Bye, everybody.
8766442	8768824	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8770795	8798794	See you next week.
