9532	36687	Thank you for watching!
39164	41788	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41808	46094	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46114	48438	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48478	55629	We're live once again tonight, July the 13th of 2025, episode number 1054 of our show.
56130	57431	My name is Rob Roberts.
57451	67787	I'm here with you every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming recipes, gaming movies, gaming gossip.
67767	68428	What else?
68448	69429	What else, DarkSakura?
69449	70912	The one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
70932	71813	What else am I missing?
71833	78122	Gaming... Gaming... Ballet moves?
81207	81447	Why?
81948	83971	Oh, DarkSakura, you have a hard Discord on mute.
84191	84872	I can see the icon.
86574	89058	Oh, sorry.
89078	89459	No, you're fine.
89479	91401	I was like, why isn't she helping me out?
91642	94245	I was going to say gaming games.
94265	95327	Oh, gaming games, yes.
96100	100587	and strategies and ballet games, which I think there's like three.
100607	101047	That's right.
101207	102069	Gaming strategies.
102129	102569	Yes.
102629	106395	My favorite band is a code in Akari Warriors, ABBA.
106735	109239	That's a code you can use in Akari Warriors.
109259	110341	There's a gaming strategy for you.
110361	113165	Gaming pinball table sucks.
113185	113886	Oh, that's right.
113926	117291	I heard the pinball table's not good, but they didn't have it at Southern Friday.
117311	118633	It's not that it's not good.
118793	120235	It's just it's not great.
120451	122313	They didn't... When I went to Southern Fry, they didn't have that.
122333	124155	That was one pinball table I was hoping to see.
124176	125577	But they did have that Elton John table.
125617	126078	It was great.
126198	126939	I did like that one.
126959	128140	Oh, I fucking love Elton John.
128160	128461	Yeah.
128681	130904	I like... I would love one of those.
130984	132866	It was so much fun when I could hear it.
132886	133267	Yeah.
133487	133747	Yeah.
133847	138773	No, it was... They had that thing on full blast at Southern Fry, and I enjoyed that table a lot.
138793	143539	I noticed that Jersey Jack tends to make these very, like, lights...
143519	149327	Show, Fireworks, they do the light show type of pinball tables, and I'm all for it, quite frankly.
149367	151070	I've got a couple of Jersey Jacks.
151190	154315	Yeah, we have Lord of the Rings.
154435	155877	Lord of the Rings was Jersey Jack, I think.
156117	156698	I'm not sure it was.
157579	159282	And we have Pirates of the Caribbean.
160504	160604	Nice.
160624	162206	And a couple of the Jersey Jack ones.
162647	163067	Love that.
163548	165050	All right, and gaming pinball.
165070	167394	Sadly, they have descended into madness.
168936	172581	All right, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
173017	173297	Hello.
173498	175481	Loki, we don't talk to you about pinball a lot.
175501	176182	Do you like pinball?
177484	181291	I still have that pinball table that I'm building that I... That's right.
181311	182192	Well, it's been a year.
182412	185097	It's been a year since I got it.
185117	188643	And it's been like a very long time since I've worked on it.
188723	190566	Just because it's so big and messy.
190766	191127	Yeah.
191147	194452	It's sitting on the DDR machine right now, the kit.
194472	199260	But I do need to go back to it, assuming that it's not all destroyed.
199443	201166	What was the last time you played that DDR machine?
201186	202988	I know not during this summer.
203009	203389	A long time.
204331	204972	It's been a while.
205492	207716	Yeah, I played it, I think, last year.
208437	209418	I haven't played it this year.
209739	213705	Certainly not any time now because it's incredibly hot in the garage.
214046	215448	But it's been a while.
215468	224742	A friend of ours on... Hey, I was going to say, talk to Dan because we put up a split in our garage and that thing stays Arctic and it wasn't that bad.
225515	236590	Yeah, I mean, if I do anything in the garage, I'd be building an office in there so I can do streaming without people coming into the kitchen and screaming and yelling and microwaves and air fryers.
237832	241196	Extra talk to Dan about that because we have a really, really good mini split.
242418	243319	Okay.
243339	245422	And gaming garage tips.
245662	247705	And we insulated our garage to build our arcade.
248606	249868	Gaming central air.
252025	280176	Anyway, hello to those This is the BGHVAC channel For all of your video game HVAC needs We also do pipe cleans and duct cleans We love to talk about And we use that microscope thing that we set down the thing to see if you've got spiders We love to talk about sucking and blowing here on Orange Saunders Radio Of course we're talking about air Anyway Talk about the gaming industry She does
282518	284520	It's gone from suck to blow.
288765	297596	Commenting live on the show, of course, all of you in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
297616	302882	That's Voice of Geeks Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
303222	310551	Bobby Blackwolf was back tonight after his little vacay last week because he was working hard up in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
310531	333872	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
333852	337317	and actually no, but he takes his time for all those lovely people to donate.
337337	338038	What about being a slow walker?
338639	342384	Anyway, so congrats to Bobby and everybody at GameStone Quick.
342424	347271	I think we have a story later on it, but I think y'all know they raised like over 2 million bucks, which is great.
347291	348793	So we'll talk more about that later in the show.
348853	359168	But yeah, kudos to VOG Zone, Bobby Blackwolf, who was a part of all that that went down up last week in Minneapolis and online everywhere.
359738	360099	All right.
361080	363383	Big thanks to those of you that are live in our chat room.
364024	366027	S2100 Matt says he's a speed reader for sure.
366167	373798	Oh, I did see that one donation that was posted to our Discord that I think was during a Super Metroid run where he did do speed reading.
374178	376481	So I guess that comment can stand.
376762	378925	I will not be striking that comment from the record after all.
379325	380447	So there you go.
380427	400782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
400762	429385	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
430343	437890	Another piracy website went down for the Nintendo Switch because, you know, they're always combating piracy.
438530	450461	So NSW2U is one of the, I guess, I don't know, more popular ROM sites for the Switch.
451121	459068	I don't know, but apparently it has been captured by the FBI, according to the domain now known
459706	465896	Popping up a website has been seized page.
465916	468079	I mean, yeah, that's... That's it.
468119	469301	Kind of makes sense.
469321	473868	Stop pirating your games because now the FBI is coming after you.
474108	480919	Do it less of a flashy way instead of having a big public website that everybody can see and expect it not to go down.
480999	483503	Like, it's... I mean, that's just...
484529	489577	Whatever, but Yes, I'm sure that has ended piracy for good now, right?
490358	498731	I'm sure that taking down this one website in no way will ever cause the Switch piracy scene to come back.
498871	501255	It's been completely defeated at this point.
502163	508899	Um, yeah, I mean, obviously, I don't endorse piracy of new stuff and things that are on the market.
509319	518601	I know there are people trying to sort of like defend what was going on as sort of like a, God, what's the defense they usually use about pirating the new games?
518621	520425	Is it game preservation?
520405	524169	But that doesn't make any sense if a lot of these games are still for sale.
525110	526392	Corporate sabotage, I'm down for that.
526512	535402	I mean, I guess, but hearing about all the layoffs that happen in the industry, unfortunately the wrong people are never held accountable when games don't sell well.
535422	538585	So I'm not a fan of piracy of current stuff.
538605	546955	Now, if we're talking about, if this were a news article about a Nintendo 64 ROM website got shut down, I'd be a little more like, what the hell?
547035	549838	Because these games are not actively making money and all that stuff.
549818	552505	but we know that does still happen.
552906	555913	Nintendo of course being one of the most litigious but you were going to say Loki?
556013	566038	There was one recently it wasn't like it was an indie game essentially so what it was is it was a beat-em-up game that was being done I
566018	593038	I still can't play it without the chipsets.
593660	594323	You can.
594443	599225	They have a special retroarch thing that they built.
599245	600008	They've emulated it?
600342	602144	they finally have emulated it?
602164	617101	they did and I mean if I don't know where you would find it on the internet maybe if someone archived it somewhere on a website with an app named for the internet archive organizational website are you talking about?
617121	627193	I'm going to say this every version that I have attempted because I really wanted to play Paprium has been non-functional
627410	638483	it's mostly functional from what I've heard now someone was selling theirs for like 800 bucks at CalX last year hmm
639188	651453	Mike Deft in chat brings up an interesting perspective saying a phrase I always hear when trying to justify piracy and specifically, especially for Nintendo stuff, excuse me, is it's morally correct to pirate Nintendo.
651473	658227	Now, I don't know about that statement, but I do remember the perspective that Mike Deft lives in Mexico.
658207	663875	And from what I recall, and please correct me if I'm wrong, it's hard for me to keep tabs on every country in the world.
663895	671685	But if I recall, there was a big hubaloo because Nintendo does not have an official distribution presence in Mexico.
671705	676872	Therefore, everything in Mexico is way more expensive when it comes to the games.
677312	684602	And so it brings back to mind a sort of similar feeling I used to have in the PlayStation era.
684582	694111	When, you know, when I would pirate DDR games, and I didn't, I would buy, I would buy the ones they made for the US, I bought Konami, I bought US Mix, I bought Beatmania.
694591	699515	But when it came to like DDR, third mix, fourth mix, I pirated those and I did not apologize for it.
699636	707423	Because my perspective was, if, if Konami wanted me to buy those games, they would release them here in the US.
707443	711786	Now, I do understand music licenses probably made some of that stuff difficult.
711827	713968	I have a better understanding of some of that now than I did then.
714089	714589	But
714569	720014	I still would support DDR where I could when it was legally available for me to do so.
720034	721516	We bought the PC version.
721656	722497	I mean, come on.
722777	723538	Yeah, that's true.
723578	725220	How much more can we support?
725240	727522	We supported the Mr. Spanky DLC, okay?
727582	728563	How many people can say that?
728583	728803	Anyway.
729684	737192	Mike Deft in chat says, a Switch 2 with Mario Kart is almost $800 US dollars, maybe around $750.
737612	740695	So I kind of...
740675	751311	I get it a little more from that perspective because it's like that's not fair that they should have to pay twice as much as we do in the U.S.
751331	754195	just because they don't have an official distribution system there.
754536	761406	So I understand where that gets a little bit trickier and probably where some of the justification for websites like this start to pop up.
761426	765332	However, if you are going to justify your piracy –
765312	787118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
787098	794391	I say in Deft's case, and people like Deft, like, you never had the opportunity to fairly buy the game anyway.
794411	796455	So I think it is a different argument in that case.
796896	807615	Yeah, and I mean, and even saying that you should feel responsible for some of that, I don't, I mean, piracy isn't even enough to make a dent in game sales, I think, for the most part.
808517	808617	Yeah.
809440	811543	Yeah, I wouldn't feel bad about it, honestly.
811864	819716	I mean, it just... Especially with just how they're treating the industry with their pricing and stuff like that.
820116	821398	Certainly, they're trying.
821739	830352	They feel that they've earned this goodwill that they're going to now exploit and see what they can do to drum up more profits, but it's...
831850	832411	I don't know.
832431	839820	I think if it's fairly priced and it's more convenient, like with Steam and stuff like that, it's a no-brainer.
839940	849832	A perfect example, look at how many games I've purchased on Steam that I don't even play, but I purchased them anyways because they look interesting.
849872	856660	It's that kind of on-a-whim impulse buying that that platform lends itself to.
856640	880622	an $80 game is not going to be an impulse buy for me so like it really needs to be good and that's the thing is a lot of these games and a lot of these you know studios looking to keep pushing that retail cost of that game up okay but my standards for your game are going to be a lot higher than every time you bump that price up my standards for what that game needs to be is going to be incredibly high and if we find that you just don't
881632	884877	Live up to those standards, then yeah, your games are going to fail.
885838	899658	I mean, there's a story we have we're going to be talking about a little bit about game delays and the whole thing with that, but one of the things that the complaints on there is like, well, yeah, but the previous game didn't do well, and it's these people's fault for that.
899678	905767	And it's like, well, yeah, but if you look at what the complaints were on that previous game, it was the monetization in it, not the actual game itself.
905827	909512	It was how you shoved monetization in, and that was the publisher's.
909492	912168	Charged $70 for a free-to-play game.
912269	913476	I've definitely heard that before.
913879	914724	Yeah.
914744	916414	Yeah, or, you know, there's...
917221	921887	There's games that have spent $800 million to be developed and still not done yet.
922568	925091	There's that type of stuff too.
925411	927954	I realize people have strong feelings on this issue.
928215	932860	Again, I don't endorse piracy of current stuff for most people.
933081	940630	I do try to understand the different angles because I also recognize it's a part of our industry we have to deal with.
941183	950571	You know, we have to kind of figure out, I think if you want to get down to, you know, trying to be successful in the industry, you have to get down to the reasons of why do people do this.
950591	954775	And, you know, I think we just talked about one when it comes to the international folks, for sure.
954795	967086	And, you know, some of the, you know, distribution and, you know, do games, are they, you know, affordable, you know, based on local, you know, economies and so forth.
968046	969908	And then I think, you know, there's,
969888	975478	I think there are some people out there, though, that just pirate because they're trying to build up an impressive collection of stuff.
976300	982932	And they have the means and whatever to support otherwise, and they are actively hurting the industry.
983633	987981	And I think game companies have to kind of think about how do they get around that.
987961	991347	and they try with things that are happening on the Switch too.
991768	993732	But again, we have a story coming up later.
993892	1000725	I don't mean to make this whole thing a teaser for later in the show, but it is what's going on this week that may be where that whole system is backfiring in a really bad way.
1001847	1004232	So it's just, it's...
1004212	1007337	It's not something you can look away from and it will disappear.
1007858	1009501	It's something that's always going to be there.
1009581	1018936	We kind of have to figure out how do we live with this and how do we make people choose to do things the way that will make these companies money.
1019317	1022963	I guess maybe the best analogy I could give is Napster.
1023584	1031632	Everybody used to download, well, not everybody, but most people used to download music all the time on Napster, MP3s, just albums, you name it.
1032233	1051633	And it wasn't until the record companies kind of figured out how to legitimize that sort of immediacy of Napster and a one-click purchase system, which really, I believe iTunes was the first to do that, that once, I know once iTunes became available, I used that and I stopped using Napster.
1051613	1074786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1075137	1078763	This is the file stuff, but viruses are written per system.
1079084	1080106	Yeah, I guess that's true.
1080587	1086477	I mean, when you have, at the time, a small user base, no one on a Mac was worried.
1086497	1087939	Don't download executables.
1088661	1089362	So, yeah.
1090103	1090564	But...
1090544	1099237	I'm just trying to make the point that it's like when this piracy was rampant everywhere, the industry sort of had to figure out how to embrace that.
1099257	1105506	And maybe to the point we were talking about earlier, maybe there needs to be a better system of worldwide distribution.
1105606	1109953	However, I keep contradicting myself tonight because we live in that kind of world.
1110473	1112316	I can't blame anybody.
1112296	1123793	for not trying to do distribution worldwide in a system that involves the US at this point in time because of everything fucky going on with tariffs and all that stuff.
1123813	1125375	So what a mess.
1126537	1127038	What a mess.
1129141	1131624	So like we said, this both sucks and blows.
1132706	1133527	We're getting it all back.
1134128	1134909	Uncontrollably.
1135270	1135751	All right.
1135771	1137153	Well, let's talk about our gaming week.
1137173	1139576	So what were the types of video games that we were playing this week?
1139616	1140818	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1142232	1147726	Mass Effect, and Dead by Daylight, and Palia.
1148408	1150052	That's about it.
1150072	1155786	And believe it or not, I am going to have to become more of a gym rat.
1158078	1162388	I will try to find ways to gamify my workouts.
1162408	1166537	And if anyone has ideas apart from using Nerd Fitness, let me know.
1166557	1177521	I would love to gamify my working out because I have to start doing one-sided deadlifts with a 50-pound kettlebell and I don't have a 50-pound kettlebell.
1179391	1184725	I don't really have a lot of advice except the one you already know, which is closing my Apple Rings.
1185066	1186168	I do that one.
1186188	1188755	But I've been going to the gym a couple times.
1188815	1190058	Not a lot, but a couple times.
1190540	1192645	And I try to make sure I close my rings.
1193207	1194410	I work out at home.
1194811	1196134	And I, of course, go to ballet.
1196114	1226121	but and this is just more of like a life thing but you know I have that injury to my leg and I had been sitting down and doing a lot more gaming because I couldn't get up and really do a lot of stuff until I started physical therapy but now he says that I'm getting a lot stronger and I only have one more appointment left to do oh nice great yeah so I'm looking for I want to start actually doing the Pikmin thing since I downloaded it I just need a walking buddy not in this heat
1227653	1230036	Call me in September.
1230997	1234121	I'll walk inside an air-conditioned mall like the old folks.
1234161	1235342	Thank you.
1235362	1237885	That's why mall walking is legit.
1237945	1240268	I don't know why mall walking is associated with old people.
1240368	1243251	Try living in Phoenix or here.
1243391	1244953	Yes, mall walking works.
1245093	1248617	We should do an 80s-style mall walk and everyone be all 80s.
1248637	1251060	I feel like I've seen that on TikTok.
1251361	1252682	There is a club that does that.
1252702	1256867	Probably not here, but that does the 80s-style mall walking.
1257421	1284677	I would be so down yeah all right S2100 Matt says I went mall walking today see it's still still a good thing all right uh Loki I think it's your turn um well I just played Minecraft this week I put together a big giant arena a battle arena type thing uh so that was like over 100,000 block build or something like that so I got that done and now I am working on developing uh
1285315	1287338	Mob Waves that you would fight in it.
1287418	1293727	So kind of working with command blocks and stuff like that and designing what that's going to be and balancing all that stuff out.
1293867	1296030	So that's what I've been working on this week.
1296070	1300997	That and, you know, between all that watching stuff on Summer Games so quick.
1301297	1302479	Nice.
1302499	1304001	Do you have a particular run you really enjoyed?
1305243	1306304	I like the Bellator run.
1306324	1309348	I watched that where they did like eight different decks or whatever.
1309669	1311471	So it was interesting to see them play that.
1311692	1312032	Nice.
1312957	1315279	Alright, my game of the week.
1315439	1318962	Kind of still on the ones I've been playing a lot recently.
1318982	1320924	Diablo 4, Season 9 is continuing.
1320944	1323326	I did hit level 60 and I'm in the Paragon levels now.
1323366	1324628	I'm up to about Paragon 30.
1324988	1333436	I just got to Torment 1, so just working on my character for the season and trying to unlock all the silly things that I like to do in that game.
1334156	1337239	Also, a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, but just a little bit.
1337259	1340382	I think I'm just kind of at the point where I'm waiting for the next patch, to be quite honest.
1340362	1344531	Actually, I'm just waiting for the next expansion to be quite real.
1344732	1347297	I don't know a nice way to say this.
1347357	1349823	I think Dawn Trail has just kind of been a bit of a flop.
1350865	1354092	But the bar for Final Fantasy XIV is also very high.
1354673	1360125	I just think that game has been so good for so long that it's not that...
1360105	1386045	Dawn Trail is necessarily like a bad game it's just bad for this game um and it just it hasn't it hasn't really lured me back in the way most of the other expansions did to be quite honest um but there's still I'm still paying for a sub so I still am signing in occasionally to try to get an upgrade to the house I'm still trying to get my crafting to 100 and at some point I'll want to get all my jobs up to 100 but I'm just kind of waiting for the rest of the systems to
1386025	1408708	Rob, after five minutes, were you like, let's get it?
1408688	1411051	Uh, but then, uh, let's see.
1411071	1411672	I've also been playing.
1411792	1416818	Oh, but you know, I have been, I've been speaking of emulation and all that.
1416978	1421624	I have been living it up and my dolphin emulator playing fantasy star online.
1421744	1422185	Yes.
1422205	1426230	I'm playing fantasy star online game cube, uh, via the emulator.
1426250	1428953	Uh, there's a server that you can connect to for that.
1428973	1431456	And I've been playing with friends just a little bit, uh,
1431436	1454794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1454774	1480663	I beat all the forests, I beat the dragon and now I'm working on the caves and god those quests get so much longer once you get to the caves because of the fact that those rooms just constantly spawn those fucking shark things over and over and over and over again but yeah PSO is still fun 20 years actually more than 20 years after that because the original was 25 years ago probably so I'm thinking about the GameCube version but yeah
1480643	1500103	PSO for life literally um I think that's about that's about it fantasy life I'm gonna finish that hopefully in the coming days all right uh we are going to get into some more news we got a lot of gaming headlines for you so let's get to it Loki what is on deck for gaming news tonight
1500809	1520674	I think I'll go for a walk I feel happy
1521616	1548214	their funding obviously was pulled for their game and it was cancelled but they're now looking for other studio partners to work with to develop stuff so that's good and maybe at least the game will get brought back in another studio or something like that or maybe they can spin it into something, who knows but at the very least Romero Games is not closed so that's good that's good
1550523	1559082	I think that's very good but are they gonna so if the funding for their game got cut are they still gonna be able to release that though?
1559281	1560823	Well, I don't know.
1561183	1567231	They said the project funding was pulled and their game was cancelled.
1567591	1575061	It says, due to confidentiality agreements, we cannot disclose the publisher's identity, though some may infer from the public information.
1575341	1575781	Interesting.
1576743	1580988	It says, as a result, we have now had to reassess our entire staffing from our studio.
1581549	1588377	Remember, our game does not close, and we're doing everything in our power to ensure that it does not come to that.
1588357	1591967	and any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect.
1591987	1593893	Hmm.
1593913	1594334	Hmm.
1594354	1600130	Interesting, except, you know, so it's like this game you know nothing about had something happen to it and we can't talk about it.
1600231	1602918	So there's the news.
1602938	1603159	Yeah.
1603983	1619882	at least they're trying I know, I know obviously we don't take delight in any studio really closing so it's good to hear that they're still at it so best of luck to them with whatever direction they end up going in but yeah, the
1619862	1637483	Those Microsoft closures really were a
1637463	1643193	You now have the labeled and standardized accessibility tags available to you.
1643213	1650004	We had talked about this before that Microsoft was going to be incorporating these into the Microsoft Store, but they are out now.
1650545	1657136	The goal is to, quote, provide players with clear and consistent information about the accessibility features in video games.
1657156	1662525	So for an example, let's take a game like South of Midnight, which is a relatively recent release.
1662505	1679586	DarkSakura.com
1679566	1691319	Visual features feature color alternatives, camera comfort, large and clear subtitles, and then input features include adjustable input sensitivity and playable without button holds.
1691720	1694588	And that's all I can read in the little screenshot.
1694568	1711480	DarkSakura, Luke,
1711460	1717167	maybe on-demand tutorials, that more strikes me as like a Bobby Blackwolf mode type of thing in a game.
1718249	1721994	And I'm not shading it whatsoever because I'm kind of thinking like, oh, I do like it.
1722094	1735251	Like, have you ever, and I'm sure you've all done this, have you ever played a game for like five hours, then you got distracted by something else, and you went back to that first game and you're like, I don't remember what the buttons do in this game.
1735431	1736753	I don't remember how to play this game.
1737233	1738816	I guess I'll have to start over.
1740438	1740758	Um...
1741936	1765615	I do that all of the time all of the time ask me why I've played Pokemon Sword and Shield like seven times at this point and haven't beaten it yet or not Sword and Shield sorry um Scarlet and Violet like seven times at this point and still haven't beaten it so on demand when I've like forgot like not how to play it but just like I barely started this game I'm just gonna start it over again yeah
1766219	1771949	So, well, I see a few people in chat, Fifth Dream and Bobby Blackwolf, ironically, are both with me saying all the time.
1772090	1772751	Yes.
1772771	1773532	So it does happen.
1773552	1773893	It does happen.
1774474	1779603	The standardized tags, this is being managed by the Entertainment Software Association.
1779663	1782969	So file this under good things that the ESA have done.
1783009	1786656	It's a very small file, but this is important to put in it.
1786676	1786776	Okay.
1786756	1796244	Input from companies included Nintendo, EA, Ubisoft, Sony, Microsoft, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Square Enix, and Warner Brothers Game have all signed on to the project.
1796524	1799086	There are 24 accessibility tags.
1799947	1803450	Nintendo and Sony have not yet updated their stores with these tags.
1803890	1806513	Microsoft is the first of the big three to do so.
1806933	1808735	So very interesting.
1808755	1811717	But I would imagine the other stores will follow soon.
1811737	1816341	So very cool feature for people that are looking for...
1816321	1818984	You know, specific accessibility needs in certain games.
1819465	1828856	So curious to see how this develops and really translates to, you know, allowing more people to play a game they may not otherwise have.
1829517	1829718	So.
1831199	1831460	All right.
1831480	1831640	Yeah.
1832000	1835425	S2100 Matt says, every once in a while, the ESA gets one clap.
1835585	1836566	Exactly.
1836586	1838589	A broken clock is still right twice a day.
1838629	1840331	We all know that old adage, right?
1840431	1843054	So, but I would say, I feel like the ESA...
1844333	1846475	I feel like they've had more wins lately.
1846695	1856344	Like, I feel like the last year especially, I've been like, okay, this isn't the end of the... This isn't alright to do, but maybe it was all stories related to this.
1857085	1857886	I wouldn't doubt that.
1857906	1859207	Maybe something lit the fire.
1859227	1859587	Maybe.
1859607	1861189	I mean, that's always a possibility.
1861329	1861669	Maybe.
1862610	1863071	Who knows?
1863091	1863571	Alright.
1864112	1864432	Anyway.
1864832	1870337	Speaking of people who should have a fire lit... We still have the industry doing a lot of crappy things though, right, Jamie?
1871278	1872079	It'd be soft.
1872447	1872908	Oh yes.
1873409	1891601	So Ubisoft, even though they just got the $1.25 billion Tencent investment, they've laid off 19 workers at Star Trek Bridge Crew and a Tom Clancy game, Red Storm, for Ubisoft Red Storm.
1892061	1892262	Yeah.
1893364	1893684	Anyway.
1894946	1896970	But they are like...
1897321	1900007	Like, yeah, it's part of our restructuring program.
1900047	1903534	We made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment.
1905779	1906360	That was the quote.
1907302	1908745	At least that's how I understood it.
1908785	1911151	Yeah, it's just summarized for context.
1911171	1913796	They say, this is not an easy decision.
1913977	1916943	It was a necessary one given our operational priorities.
1917163	1917945	Blah, blah.
1918381	1942178	um severance packages blowing you know smoke up their ass that kind of thing um they said that no other locations were impacted by the layoffs but they didn't comment when asked for more information about the head count um for uh for Red Storm and their projects so um yeah um
1943592	1961217	But they got all this money from Tencent, so... I mean, I understand it being an ongoing restructuring, but even so, when they have an influx of money, then should they not reevaluate that plan?
1961517	1965082	Unless this influx of money was a calculated part of that plan, I don't know.
1966304	1970089	But... I'm just like...
1971335	1985312	You do wish some of these companies would see that they could do a morally nice thing, correct thing I would even argue, by, you know, let's say you have these 19 people on Star Trek Bridge Crew, which I understand that game's been out a little while now.
1985873	1989197	VR gaming hasn't exactly launched into the stratosphere.
1989717	1992060	It's, you know, it's kind of there.
1992040	2001474	Although, you know, Beat Saber's still doing its thing, because I saw some of that during Summer Games Done Quick, too, and that was fun to watch.
2001534	2004619	I was going to say, they stopped their support for that game, but I know it.
2004779	2010167	On PlayStation, but that's because it's a meta thing now, so Facebook wants it all to itself.
2010890	2021868	Other stuff, you know, I mean, this was a studio in North Carolina, but we're also dealing with a lot of video game related research losing their funding.
2021888	2028378	A lot of schools losing their funding for their programs because of the turd in chief.
2029080	2029320	Mm hmm.
2030330	2041302	and you know library services losing their funding which also we're doing some cataloging of games so it's it's really not a good time
2041484	2065048	Well, just to quickly finish my thought too on what I wish Ubisoft would have done, if you know you're going to lay off these 19 people on this one game, why can't you invest just a little bit into the learning or the development of these folks to be able to put them on another project, to be able to assign them to another, you know, it's not like Ubisoft doesn't have tons of other projects out there that could use a little help in moving along.
2065088	2067330	It's just, it's just, it's unfortunate.
2067570	2067690	What?
2067931	2068111	What?
2068391	2068791	What?
2068952	2069432	What?
2069412	2070333	Look at who's in charge.
2070514	2072577	Oh, yeah.
2072597	2075982	I was going to say in charge of what, but it doesn't matter either way you slice it.
2076463	2076904	I get it.
2077104	2082953	I mean, but it's just... Yeah, and I'm sure the investors are happy because at the end of the day, it's more money in their pocket.
2083494	2085437	But, like, I don't know.
2085897	2086358	Just...
2087468	2094042	When in the fuck are billionaires going to start to feel the heat for once?
2094343	2096107	That's what I would like to know.
2096407	2097550	We start eating them.
2097930	2098692	Yummy, yummy.
2098953	2107030	Maybe when people walk in higher force and with torches.
2107010	2109014	I'm just saying.
2109034	2111599	It's just, it's a crazy world we live in.
2112080	2112401	All right.
2113202	2113743	Moving on.
2113763	2114525	Let's talk about.
2114565	2116529	Stupid world we live in is what it is.
2116549	2117871	It's a crazy, stupid world.
2119695	2124985	Loki, let's talk about deals going, you know, deals for the rest of us going away.
2125488	2133503	Yeah, you know, Nintendo used to have this thing, this voucher program where you'd pay $100 and it'd allow you to get two Nintendo games.
2133523	2139514	Saving you a little bit of money because, you know, the games were like $60 or, you know, in some cases now $70.
2139635	2146427	So, you know, that was a savings of potentially $40 if you played your cards right.
2147309	2147850	Um...
2148168	2161587	So Nintendo, you know, I guess thinking that somehow devaluing their $80 games, says, uh-uh-uh, we're gonna kill this, and it's going away January 2026.
2162309	2173046	Here's my question with all that, because this part would make a little more sense.
2173587	2178394	Are you able to use those Nintendo vouchers on Switch 2 games?
2178374	2185424	or are you using Nintendo vouchers on Switch 1 games and you are still going to have to pay the upgrade fee?
2185444	2192854	Because remember, Metroid Prime 4 and Pokemon ZA Legends, blah, blah, blah, are original Switch games, technically.
2192874	2196379	I would never want to play Pokemon Legends ZA on an original Switch.
2196479	2197040	I'm sorry.
2197060	2198903	The original cries enough.
2198963	2202247	I can't imagine what a shitshow Z to A is going to be.
2202267	2203810	But on the Switch 2, I'm sure it'll be great.
2204130	2204871	But...
2204851	2221020	if these vouchers only work on the original Nintendo Switch then I could see that maybe Nintendo is sunsetting them simply because there are not going to be as many original Switch first party titles coming like we know Tomodachi Life but that's probably the end of it
2222148	2226313	Yeah, right now it's basically talking about with the Switch vouchers.
2226373	2228756	It says, what are Nintendo Switch vouchers?
2228796	2229277	Blah, blah, blah.
2229297	2237387	It says that they, you know, obviously they purchased in sets of two and cannot be redeemed for Nintendo Switch 2 games.
2237407	2239329	So yes, you do have a point.
2239349	2241632	So that's what it is.
2242052	2250703	And you should be aware if you use this to get Metroid Prime 4 and
2250683	2269249	Pokemon Legends CA you're going to have to buy the upgrades so you're going to have to math this out and see if this still saves you money because the question would be are they $20 upgrades or are they $10 upgrades because if they're $10 upgrades you would probably save money if they're $20 upgrades you might not
2269229	2277239	It says they said spending $120 on vouchers and upgrades instead of the $140 is what they would normally be.
2277259	2280202	So I'm guessing the upgrades are $10 then?
2280623	2281203	That makes sense.
2281223	2283226	I just couldn't remember how much they were for the Zeldas.
2283366	2285669	I thought there were $20 for the Zelda games.
2286730	2287070	I don't know.
2287130	2287551	Maybe.
2287811	2289213	I mean, I don't know.
2289233	2290735	I can't keep track of it anymore.
2291656	2293798	Yeah, because the system is too complicated.
2294519	2295220	So...
2296803	2302774	That sucks, but I don't know if they're going to come out with anything similar to that for Switch 2.
2303275	2306161	DEF says $10 for Switch 2 upgrades.
2306742	2311110	So then it would still save you money because you would buy the vouchers.
2311431	2317562	Just like you said, it's $120 for the voucher way and $140 if you don't do the voucher way.
2317542	2320165	for Prime and Pokemon ZA.
2320626	2328016	So I have to think about if I might want to do this, actually, because my coworkers were kind enough to gift me $100 in Nintendo credit.
2328437	2331761	And I just kind of assumed I was going to get Donkey Kong Bananas with it.
2333403	2337829	But now I'm like, ooh, maybe I want to get the vouchers so that I can get Prime 4
2337809	2342634	and that because essentially my coworkers graciously already bought me that.
2342714	2345036	So really, I'd only be paying the 20 bucks to upgrade them.
2345296	2349600	So I guess and those are games I know I'm going to play the heck out of.
2349620	2352743	So the question is, am I going to be suckered into an impulse buy with Donkey Kong?
2353023	2353824	Probably.
2353844	2354645	Let's be real with ourselves.
2354665	2355105	Probably.
2355185	2356146	I probably will.
2356166	2360570	I probably I still want to get Bravely Default 2 or Bravely Default for Switch 2, which I still haven't purchased.
2360590	2365835	So because I'm forcing myself to beat some games I already own first, like Fantasy Life.
2366556	2367597	So.
2368336	2368716	All right.
2369277	2371320	S2100 Matt says, Rob has nice coworkers.
2371360	2371820	Yes, I do.
2371840	2373182	I actually thought that was really cool.
2373502	2375404	You know, and we try, we kind of tried to do that.
2375424	2379149	We know people's interests, like, you know, so we'll try to get a gift card.
2379670	2385076	If we know their interest, if we don't, then there's always like, you know, an Amazon card or a, you know, coffee, something.
2385096	2390082	But yeah, they knew that I was a gamer, probably because my boss has listened to this show before.
2390543	2391884	Hi, if you're out there listening.
2393426	2394027	What's that, Jamie?
2395148	2396790	I said, hi, Rob's boss.
2399065	2400086	Give them a raise.
2400286	2409295	No, the thing that I like is that work – and this was true about one of my older jobs too that I had.
2409315	2411897	And I'm very fortunate because this show has been on so damn long.
2411917	2415261	I've had multiple jobs during the course of being on this show.
2415661	2428093	But the thing that's in common with my current employer as well as an employer I've had in the past is that my boss would recognize that the skills that I use to put on this –
2428073	2436604	could be things that lend themselves in the workplace, such as we might be looking at trying to do a podcast at work.
2436624	2441050	Maybe Rob is somebody that knows a little something about that.
2441270	2445095	Or at my old job, it was Rob uses all those tech things.
2445115	2446978	We should get him into e-learning development.
2446998	2449421	And that's how I got my foot in the door when it came to e-learning development.
2449461	2451904	So that's...
2451884	2457436	You know, I'm very happy when an employer can sort of recognize those sort of strengths.
2457476	2473048	But I have also been fortunate and privileged enough to work at places that I do feel like do the morally correct thing we were talking about earlier and make those types of investment in their workforces to make stronger employees, which unfortunately in the video game industry... That's why I like where I work.
2473028	2473789	Yeah, exactly.
2473809	2475812	It leads to happy employees.
2475832	2483764	But unfortunately with so many companies in the video game industry, not all, it wouldn't be fair to say all, but so many companies in the video game industry is not the case.
2484085	2487009	People are just expendable and it's just, it's very unfortunate.
2487670	2489653	So, yeah.
2490443	2491084	All right, anyway.
2491324	2494588	Some people enjoy money more than other people.
2494608	2497691	S2100 Matt says, treating employees well, crazy talk, Rob.
2497711	2498312	I know, right?
2498372	2509225	But to put things in perspective, I worked at that former company for 14 years until the writing was on the wall that our jobs were going to be sent to another country.
2509645	2510446	And then I left.
2510987	2515852	And my current employer, I'll stay at until I'm 65 if they'll have me, quite honestly.
2516293	2517274	I don't plan to leave.
2517775	2519016	So...
2519215	2538304	I'm planning on staying where I am I'll tell you what, me talking about how I like to make spreadsheets to track my progress in some of the games I play actually did get me an assignment so I was very happy I'm doing that with Pokemon Go and Shinies You should see my Dead by Daylight tracking list
2538335	2539996	The funniest fucking thing.
2540017	2548604	I finally caved and bought an office subscription because I wanted PowerPoint for the thing we did at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.
2548624	2558033	I was like, and the reality is because I use PowerPoint so fucking much in my day job, I was like, I can't do this open office stuff anymore.
2558173	2560295	I can't do the Apple thing.
2560335	2561436	I just don't use enough, Jamie.
2561556	2562697	I don't use it enough.
2562717	2565159	And so I was like, I need to be able to do this fast.
2565179	2568342	So in times when you need the- Why don't you just get something-
2568322	2570205	Go with what you know.
2570546	2570927	With what?
2572249	2575595	OpenOffice or LibreOffice work exactly the same as PowerPoint.
2575815	2576737	No, they do not.
2577077	2577698	No, they don't.
2577839	2578860	I just said why.
2578940	2583629	Because the muscle memory that I have with PowerPoint doesn't work with OpenOffice.
2583929	2588918	Because I can tell you, I do this show role in OpenOffice, whatever their version of Excel is.
2589038	2589459	Numbers?
2589499	2590480	I don't know what they call it.
2590500	2591983	Whatever the OpenOffice is.
2591963	2593284	Oh, Numbers is Apple.
2593705	2594346	Sheets.
2594366	2595447	Sheets.
2595467	2596068	Holy sheets.
2596428	2601273	I do the show but then like honestly, but now I did a Pokemon Go.
2601394	2602415	I have my shiny.
2602495	2620715	I'm making a spreadsheet for all of my shinies so I can show what I'm willing to trade at a moment's notice in Excel because I just, again, when you spend so much time in Excel at your day job, I swear to God I can do it two times faster, three times faster in that than trying to use another program.
2621316	2621616	So,
2621596	2644650	I do much better presentations though with numbers and and keynote but which which is also am embedded in both of those with the projects I'm on I'm not saying I'm loyal to Excel because I love Microsoft I'm loyal to Excel because that's what my company chose to use during the day so that's what I know so it's that that's what it is yeah yeah if you want to use if you want to use the you know the boring
2644630	2645551	Oh, whatever.
2646413	2648356	S the show and Hunter Matt says, Shane taught you well.
2648376	2649858	This had nothing to do with Shane, actually.
2649878	2652281	I even texted him saying, you'd be proud of me.
2652302	2653744	I'm making a spreadsheet for Pokemon.
2654385	2656247	Def said, you made a spreadsheet for shinies.
2656267	2658010	You're deep and shiny hunting it seems now.
2658030	2659212	Yes, it's for Pokemon Go.
2659552	2667865	And because it's all in the office thing, I can send people a OneDrive link when we turn lucky friends and I can say like, here's my shiny list.
2667885	2671971	If it's in green, I have three or more and I'm willing to trade.
2673115	2679804	If it's yellow, I have two or more and I might be willing to trade for something that I'm missing type of thing.
2679904	2681446	So I have my whole little system.
2681486	2684330	So now when I go lucky friends and people are like, what do you have?
2684471	2686854	I can send a list and be like, here, this is what I have.
2686894	2687595	This is what I don't have.
2687995	2688236	Done.
2688596	2690839	Here's a detailed spreadsheet outlining everything.
2690979	2692702	Because I'm a gamer.
2694004	2698009	And people's eyes close over and they're like, what in the corporate America is this?
2701735	2703678	All right, where the hell were we?
2703839	2706023	Oh, we're going to get to this story about Nintendo.
2706363	2710570	So this isn't cute, and this plays into something we were talking about at the beginning of the show.
2710591	2720588	And this has to do with a Nintendo Switch 2 user who is claiming to be banned from their Switch 2 for a fault that they're saying is not their own.
2720568	2747419	so here's the thing it is an owner that posted on reddit and usually you would take these reddit stories and go does that make it true but thinking through this is where you have to bring in the wheel of plausibility thinking of everything this guy this this individual i should say this guy this individual is talking about it certainly adds up it adds up with everything we know about nintendo system and the way things work and it's worth talking about so here it is
2747753	2756248	Apparently, they downloaded patches for Switch game cards, Switch 1 cards, that they bought off a Facebook marketplace.
2756268	2757631	Well, there's your first mistake.
2757871	2760095	Never buy anything off Facebook marketplace.
2760175	2761598	That place is a shithole.
2762099	2762860	But...
2763970	2767735	I know people have used it successfully.
2767755	2770999	I'm sure chat is correcting me as I'm speaking.
2771300	2774664	I purchased a DDR machine off of Facebook Marketplace.
2775285	2777608	You know what a cesspool it can be there too.
2777748	2779751	You have to be very, very careful.
2779831	2780893	Buyer or seller.
2781033	2784257	One key word, Facebook.
2785570	2787472	That is a key part of the problem.
2788093	2790997	Honestly, Craigslist felt safer.
2791017	2794441	But here we are in this day and age where a lot of people are using Facebook Marketplace.
2794561	2797886	But it actually, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where he bought it.
2797946	2807658	But the user on Reddit said they put the game into their Switch 2 to patch, but found out their online services were restricted the day after.
2807678	2813105	The Switch 2 user then called Nintendo, where they discovered they were banned.
2813125	2813265	Banned.
2813245	2828622	and DarkSakura.com.
2828602	2850745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2850725	2859604	and then resell that physical game card so that's where you have to get a little distrusting of places like Facebook Marketplace you don't know if the card you're buying is even legit in the first place
2860748	2870163	Now, once Nintendo detects two instances of the unique code being online at the same time, it's going to ban any account that's using it.
2870183	2874529	And so, you know, if you are pirating Nintendo software, you know what's going on.
2874650	2889152	But if you're buying things secondhand, especially in a place full of casual buyers like Facebook, you may not know that this cartridge is actually a burned, essentially, image from online, and it may get your Switch 2 bricked.
2890904	2898805	Now, after proving that they bought the Switch games, the Redditors said they were told the cartridges are fine and able to be resold.
2898825	2907006	But this is still a very kind of interesting tale that's probably going to give people reservation about buying games secondhand.
2907678	2913105	So, Dr. Zia said, I've heard about folks being banned for using that device you were referring to.
2913905	2918791	Mish in chat says, I feel like at this point they're putting too many restrictions on the Switch 2 now.
2918811	2921695	Mind you, I don't condone pirating.
2921715	2924018	Exactly, and there's the rub.
2924038	2930125	I may not support pirating, but somebody may be able to make a really convincing fake.
2930105	2935714	If they have the right color cartridge and a good enough printer to make a little sticker, what am I going to do?
2936154	2938438	Lick that cartridge to tell if it's authentic or not?
2939279	2940681	Were you just reading my mind?
2940701	2942083	Because I was saying you could lick it.
2942344	2950716	No, literally, if I were ever to be at a point in my life where I'm buying Switch games off Facebook Marketplace, I would insist on doing the lick test.
2951117	2952719	I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to lick this game.
2952739	2954702	Yeah, but they could probably put that stuff on there.
2954763	2955724	That's just...
2955704	2957246	You can get that stuff.
2957386	2958388	But would they think to?
2958468	2960711	Would they think that the casual people would do it?
2960891	2964616	Don't put anything that you get from Facebook Marketplace in your mouth.
2964636	2965297	Yeah, that's true.
2965557	2967660	I might end up with more than a Switch game.
2967880	2969743	I might end up with more than a Switch game.
2970143	2971866	I might end up with a staff infection.
2971886	2972506	I would not trust that.
2972527	2975531	You know, maybe silverware.
2975591	2976932	We run that through the dishwasher.
2976952	2978134	But yeah, I'm not like...
2978789	2980656	That's true.
2981278	2982724	Free antibiotics.
2982744	2983587	You have malaria.
2985012	2989710	How else am I supposed to know if the game is legit or not without trying to eat it?
2991513	2993155	And let's just put it this way.
2993215	2999463	It's like those old cartoons of Porky Pig or Bugs Bunny or whoever biting down on the nickel to see if it's real.
3000164	3005971	Yeah, it's not even Facebook Marketplace though, because the same thing could happen anywhere you buy used games with the Switch.
3006392	3016385	Granted, you know, like say if I purchase it from GameStop or something like that, there's a little bit of recourse because they can go back and see, oh, this person traded it in.
3017346	3021351	Although technically it's not stolen, so they can't really...
3021331	3023715	It wouldn't be a matter for the police.
3023755	3032470	I know that they keep the information about the person that trades stuff in because of different laws regarding stolen goods.
3032610	3042286	But in this case, if it's just that you traded in something that was banned, I don't know what they could really do there.
3042767	3043508	I mean...
3044197	3068601	I don't know I don't know if they'd pursue it it's that whole thing so GameStop from what I understand will not take a game that is sealed they will not buy back a game that is sealed um because the chance is too high that it was stolen off a shelf but what ends up happening is that some people find it under the Christmas tree or whatever and they try to sell it back and because they're like I already have this game or whatever and then GameStop won't take it because
3068581	3070523	It's stupid anyways.
3070543	3077891	I mean, the whole problem was created by Nintendo in the first place to try to combat piracy, but really you're doing more harm to the consumer.
3078371	3092646	Once again, going back to the whole adage with DRM anyways, a lot of the times it's a legitimate consumer that gets punished more over this DRM than the actual people pirating those games.
3092726	3094808	Because the people pirating those games...
3095311	3117623	they're playing it on a modded Switch that's probably not connected to the internet so for them, they're not really going to run into any problems but the consumer that is using that card yeah, they will run into problems, which sucks it to me communicates that Nintendo is not doing this right but yeah
3119105	3120567	Let's see.
3120907	3122249	Very interesting comments in chat.
3122349	3126655	S2100Matt says, I knew someone who bought a hearing aid off of a dead person.
3126715	3127977	The family sold it.
3127997	3131562	That's actually not that uncommon, though, because that's just medical equipment.
3131582	3141956	And when grandma or grandpa passes away, quite oftentimes there's an estate sale and wheelchair, hospital bed, all of that ends up being up for grabs and people need that stuff.
3142116	3146682	It's a weird-ass fucking reflection of the society we live in.
3146662	3151168	But yes, the hearing aid doesn't surprise me, honestly.
3151208	3153652	There's a charity group in Alabama.
3153732	3174762	It's how my mom got oxygen tanks and a walker when she had gotten out of the hospital that will take in donated, you know, whether they're from the deceased or old surplus or what have you, and then loan them out for free to people who need them indefinitely.
3175687	3203365	um interesting Ranmari says maybe they don't want the game because some cruel motherfucker gifted them a crazy bullet hell game well that's absurd bullet hell games are fun they're frustrating but you should at least try them anyway uh that's when you that's when you create the service we'll adopt your unloved bullet hell games for free you're just giving Ranmari Idea a sign for their next convention to walk around holding um
3204509	3211878	TheGorilla72 says, so why does GameStop sell me new games that are open then?
3211898	3213499	Is that still a thing that GameStop does?
3213560	3215221	I thought they were told to knock that off.
3216723	3219887	Honestly, y'all, I have not bought a game in GameStop in so long.
3220307	3220808	I don't know.
3220928	3222390	I can't tell you the last time I bought a game there.
3222610	3224132	They use it for displays.
3224432	3225994	Wow, Gorilla says they sure do.
3226244	3231815	They have a display copy because manufacturers are being cheap.
3232236	3236504	They don't send display copies for these stores.
3236545	3244320	So they have one that's out there and then they keep everything behind the counter because they don't want live product out on the floor for a lot of that stuff.
3244300	3254293	They should get the person that draws all the fake box art at GameStop to... Just don't buy games from GameStop.
3254393	3255335	There you go.
3255375	3257798	That just saves yourself.
3258439	3264547	Honestly, it really doesn't make sense to do it anymore unless it's ultra convenient for you.
3264627	3267050	Just go purchase it from anywhere else.
3267491	3270354	Purchase it off Amazon, purchase it from wherever.
3270935	3272417	It's just GameStop...
3272633	3280022	I mean, even when you go in looking for things, it's just very not what it used to be, obviously.
3280042	3281163	So, I don't know.
3281183	3282004	Don't give them money.
3282325	3284407	It is weird to me, though, if that's the reason.
3284427	3286550	Because TigerClaw says, why not print the box art?
3286610	3287671	And I do have to go.
3288111	3288432	Copyright.
3288732	3290494	It actually is a legal thing.
3290514	3293999	But wouldn't the publisher send a PDF?
3294359	3297302	I mean, they are trying to sell that publisher's game.
3297663	3297763	Yeah.
3298300	3317743	DarkSakura,
3318179	3340980	dating everybody here so it's kind of like the blockbuster model where you have you know your thing on the shelf with the game and you go up to me like I would like this game and they have all the games behind the counter but there's one copy that they use to make that display copy that then doesn't have the card in it well right no no that's I don't think that that's
3342023	3344066	is that what they were talking about?
3344087	3346050	just having the one up there?
3346110	3361416	I thought they were talking about putting the copies out on the shelves the used ones we're crossing our wires we're talking about both at the same time this is basically where they're taking a new copy
3361936	3367687	Opening it up, taking the game out, putting it behind the counter, and then someone wants to go purchase whatever game it is.
3367728	3369030	They're like, oh, it's the last copy.
3369551	3370072	It's open.
3370112	3372217	I'm going to put the game back in there, and here you go.
3372237	3373299	It's the same price as new.
3373339	3374140	It's like, well, hold on.
3374201	3375744	No, you opened that, though.
3376104	3377708	Yeah, but it's new.
3377728	3379030	It's never played, but it's new.
3379471	3380974	Yeah, but it's not sealed.
3380954	3382677	but you're trying to charge me the same price.
3382817	3384801	Yeah, but it's new.
3384821	3386483	Honestly, they should just take the hit for it.
3386844	3389368	I mean, because they're not selling used copies.
3389849	3391632	Exactly, because, I mean, I'm sorry.
3391652	3392473	It's not my problem.
3392994	3396080	But they don't, and a lot of people just take it.
3396480	3397201	They're like, whatever.
3397582	3398303	Tiger Claw.
3398323	3401088	Yeah, like, SSG100 Matt says it's like selling the 4 model.
3401489	3402110	Yeah.
3402130	3402270	Mm-hmm.
3402352	3410402	TigerClaw in chat says, I remember way back in the days at Toys R Us, they had something that looked like the box art and what was on the back of it so you can see what the game looks like.
3410722	3413666	Did you know in Japan they still use the slips?
3413686	3414827	Shane just told me that.
3414847	3416950	They still use the slips at Toys R Us in Japan.
3417651	3418652	What a time to be alive.
3420114	3422597	There's plenty of other places that do that too.
3423558	3424579	In Japan, that is.
3424610	3429975	TheGorilla72 says, I'm so old, I've been shopping at GameStop since they were Funkoland.
3429995	3433719	My friend, I remember when Funkoland only advertised in magazines.
3435221	3438504	I remember when you had to get the piece of paper to find out what the price of the game was.
3439845	3441206	I mean, it's GameStop.
3441226	3448233	By the way, you know that Dan managed GameStops for a long time, but he started with Funkoland.
3448534	3449875	Yeah, yeah.
3449990	3451832	Yeah, I mean, they're fine.
3451892	3456337	It's just like, I don't know, like, I find myself wanting to go into them less and less.
3456357	3461403	Like, every time I go in there to look at stuff, it's just like, eh.
3461423	3463525	It's like, there's no selection of anything.
3464126	3466028	It's just garbage I don't want.
3466348	3467489	And there's no deals.
3467990	3471914	What was that Garfield shirt I saw the last time I was in a game shop?
3472455	3473035	A game shop?
3473115	3473816	A game stop.
3473836	3475979	I was cracking up so fucking bad.
3476960	3477280	Um...
3478002	3479143	God, now I gotta find it.
3479364	3481807	I was so bored, I went to GameStop.
3483750	3484370	I'll find it.
3485412	3488496	I do like to look- I actually got my Kirby coin purse there.
3489497	3495465	Yeah, because they sell a lot of, like, crap now, but, you know, sometimes it's interesting crap.
3495485	3499270	They actually have, like, really good official merch, and they'll have them marked down.
3499490	3499730	Yeah.
3500912	3502474	Okay, I'm trying to see if I can find-
3503450	3507815	But when I lived in Alabama, we had EB and we had Babbage's.
3508736	3509477	Oh, I found it.
3509577	3510057	I found it.
3510077	3517085	It was a shirt with Garfield on it that said, Stay Chill, where Garfield's licking an ice cream cone.
3517506	3520129	And I was like, that's gamer merch?
3520789	3527517	This looks like what mom wears the oversized shirt to stay home with.
3528188	3530292	and sit on the couch all day.
3530312	3534440	Because they sell pop culture stuff now, and so there's a lot of that.
3535041	3539730	No, seriously, because I got, I think, an Office shirt for my wife from there.
3540090	3551091	They have lots of just... It's basically a Hot Topic merch now that they have in there because... I mean, to be honest, they're making...
3551712	3561299	No Margin on the games, and they have to make profit with higher margin stuff, like those Funko Pops and everything.
3561961	3565671	That said, though... Did somebody say Funko Pops at a GameStop?
3567068	3590646	I got pictures of those too I just don't I'll do a deal on them if you like buy like they'll let you do the buy one get one thing if it's like you know because they do that for the sale ones if you're buying a new one and you want to pick up a sale one at the free or half price they'll do that sometimes I will say though they did have a nice Sprigatito purse they had a nice Sprigatito purse I would have maybe bought that
3590626	3599018	Literally the last thing I bought at a GameStop was my little fuzzy Kirby coin purse and a squishy flying Kirby.
3599739	3601161	I'll put it on our Discord.
3601261	3602803	Alright, enough GameStop talk.
3602843	3603945	Let's move on to our next story.
3605767	3609212	But I like squishy Kirbys.
3609232	3612457	Me too, but... Alright, well.
3613258	3613518	So.
3615020	3619907	I know people who are into scary-ass freaky game subnautica.
3620292	3634110	and on July 2nd, Krafton had said they removed members of the Subnautica 2 leadership team after I think that there was a leak.
3634131	3640739	Yeah, they did confirm that there was a leak and the game is kind of in a little bit of trouble.
3640860	3644224	There's just a lot of drama around it.
3644947	3672540	But they got rid of the game director, Charlie Cleveland, the co-founder of Unknown Worlds, Max McGuire, and the studio CEO, Ted Gill And then they have since filed a lawsuit against the developer in South Korea for wrongful dismissal But they were canned because there was considered a lack of progress on the game and inadequate content
3672520	3700452	and that they were not fulfilling their leadership duties and so the game is behind the schedule because of it but I don't know but the leak on here it's like a state of development where the development progress was and them disagreeing on the release schedules it's some pretty interesting stuff
3701174	3710064	and while I don't, you know this is actually posted on Reddit and I mean, I'll tell you what, I'll repost it in our chat right now.
3710224	3713748	That's always lovely to have your corporate drama playing out on Reddit.
3713908	3716431	That's a lovely thing for these companies to have.
3717993	3728785	Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, it is an interesting look behind the curtain especially because I think that
3730064	3740395	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3741590	3768981	they're even talking about like all of the list of changes from the launch specifications from 2023 to 2025 they're saying that there's a quote exactly on here it says the game's content volume has been scaled down compared to the initial EA spec target making it necessary to release the feasibility of the planned launch reassess sorry the feasibility of the planned launch but very
3770378	3771300	Very curious.
3773625	3777574	And it even talks about parts of what happens in the game.
3779819	3782806	So, very interesting.
3782826	3784409	Let me go ahead and spoil the plot.
3784429	3785091	I'm so annoyed.
3785271	3785592	Alright.
3788158	3789180	Loki, what do you got for us?
3790544	3799764	So, Destiny 2 apparently is getting some blowback from their upcoming The Edge of Fate expansion.
3801247	3808502	They were giving free loot for players, and apparently every day you can log in and get loot and all that stuff from...
3808482	3815254	The Emissary Vendor, and eventually claim an infinite nonary engram.
3815274	3818940	Wow, none of this makes any sense to me because I don't play any Destiny whatsoever.
3818960	3825131	I played it a few times and I sort of remember that stuff, but I... Okay.
3825151	3827976	But basically... Rare digital shit.
3829610	3852377	so apparently players had discovered a trick for farming them in mass and uh so because those nonary engrams or whatever drop cosmetics uh and Bungie basically said stop doing that uh so there's ways to essentially game the system to get all these unlimited cosmetics and you know
3853133	3860040	They don't want that because that cuts into their bread and butter of monetization of their free-to-play games.
3860180	3861962	So, yeah.
3862202	3867308	And then also, because they did that, they shut down the whole thing.
3868189	3869330	So this is due to an issue.
3869370	3873935	We have disabled the daily bonus of Nonary Engram available at the Emissary.
3874355	3876998	We are investigating a fix for the players.
3877018	3880321	And then because of that, people are now mass-deleting characters.
3880822	3882904	Basically saying that we are...
3882968	3887394	We are tired of this nonsense.
3887414	3887715	I don't know.
3888957	3890920	We're not gonna take it.
3892582	3895026	No, we're not gonna take it.
3895046	3898751	So, yeah, they said basically kill my drive for Luta Palooza.
3900493	3905481	Looks like tonight I finally check out that Mecha Break game.
3905501	3906702	Don't give them any more attention.
3907303	3909747	We already saw enough trailers for that.
3909767	3910087	Alright.
3910368	3910528	Alright.
3910660	3937107	Sheld Need for Speed
3937087	3941172	and is quietly parking, is that a pun, the series.
3941192	3951365	Speed Hunters was a site, by the way, that was partially funded by EA, or I think maybe it was funded in full by EA, and last had an update in April and is apparently ceasing operations.
3951986	3952687	Hmm.
3952707	3956952	No official statement yet from EA on the Need for Speed franchise, but...
3956932	3962102	The publisher did shut down online servers for Need for Speed Rivals on October 7th.
3962323	3963525	Or it will be shutting it down.
3964547	3968936	Criterion Games moved most of the employees to focus on the Battlefield franchise.
3969778	3978636	And Battlefield head Vince Zampella told Eurogamer that the Need for Speed team would be, quote, "...joining their colleagues working on Battlefield."
3978616	3984247	So if there is a need for speed going, we don't know who's working on it.
3984267	3989257	So signs are pointing to the fact that this franchise may be donezo, which is kind of sad.
3989337	3991461	I thought it really still had its fans.
3991481	3999557	I mean, I know Forza Horizon is a thing that a lot of people are playing, but that doesn't mean it can't exist at the same time with Need for Speed and some of the other big racing franchises out there.
3999938	4001080	That's kind of sad.
4001819	4006509	Sj100Matt says, listen, I'm a petty bitch when it comes to Need for Speed.
4006529	4011138	I always disliked the EA made Criterion Games work on the franchise rather than Burnout.
4011158	4014946	The Burnout franchise died for Need for Speed to live and I'm bitter about it.
4015467	4016609	Honestly, valid.
4016629	4017932	I really like Burnout too.
4018654	4022241	So I understand that frustration to be quite honest.
4024364	4032523	Well, with all of these dying games, sometimes we need to go back and recognize a classic, something we want to go back and play.
4032883	4035369	Although, I don't know, it might be difficult to check out this one, but we'll see.
4035730	4040601	Let's roll the Classic Game of the Week bump and let Jamie do her thing.
4051010	4058870	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4058890	4062520	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4062540	4065407	Alright, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us this week?
4066383	4086265	Hell or Jigoku
4086245	4089930	You have to reach Buddha to have your fate decided.
4090110	4095457	Tarosuke has key bullets that he can fire at enemies and charge to increase his power.
4095958	4099142	Enemies can drop money and you can buy weapons and other stuff.
4100043	4101164	And there are two versions.
4101765	4105570	This is actually of the arcade release.
4105550	4129127	there's a Japanese version and an English version but that English version was only released in other Asian countries outside of Japan the arcade archives by the way have both versions of the game so Tarosuke was banished to Jigoku for causing mischief in the world of the living and so he has to go fight
4129107	4157646	the monsters in hell to reach Iyama who is the Buddhist deity that judges the dead to determine his fate and you have five different levels each taking place in different parts of Jigoku so there is Jigoku Iriguchi which is the gate to hell, Yukai the ghost sea, other levels like that and so the first four stages have a boss fight with an Oni
4157626	4175922	and then at the beginning of these Tarosuke has to kneel in a shrine and summon a spirit named Monmotaro to defeat the oni and you play as Monmotaro not Momotaro but Monmotaro and you can fly around and shoot pellets kind of you know
4176391	4183400	And then it gets harder as you go along and you have to find different secret items to unlock the way out.
4184261	4185722	All kinds of stuff.
4185802	4197457	And on top of that, the Famicom version has a pious meter that's filled when Tarosuke does good deeds, such as completing his objectives in the levels.
4197477	4200981	And the pious meter also determines which of the endings that you get.
4200961	4206674	So given that I did speak about a Famicom version, there are other releases.
4206694	4212347	It was ported to the PC Engine and Famicom with some changes, of course.
4212889	4219965	The PC Engine version and the arcade version were both re-released for the Japanese Virtual Console.
4219945	4230224	and a Japan-only spin-off called Kyukai Dolchiki, which is a baseball version of the game.
4230724	4233009	A yakyu, as it is.
4233169	4238258	And it's very similar to Namco's World Stadium series.
4238238	4255838	Tarosuke also appeared in Namco X Capcom on PS2 and he teamed up with Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei Tomaden and he also has a cameo appearance in Project X Zone 2 for the 3DS.
4256799	4267131	At any rate, Game Machine publication said that Yokai Dolchiki was the most popular arcade game in the month of April 1987 and went on to be
4267111	4273359	The fifth highest grossing table arcade game in 1987 in Japan.
4273379	4275161	Also, Gamest gave it some awards.
4275201	4279426	It won the 8th Grand Prize and 4th Best Ending Award and 8th Best Graphics.
4279927	4282090	Famitsu gave it the Silver Hall of Fame.
4282630	4283932	That's for the Famicom version.
4285194	4285834	But there you go.
4286615	4290460	And it's a neat, fun little game.
4291662	4293604	I know not a lot of people have heard of it.
4294405	4296848	But it's worth checking out.
4296946	4301131	Yeah, this I, you know, again, I'm sorry, the podcast listeners can't see the visuals here.
4301151	4309620	But, you know, this is, this is a pretty neat looking game for the era, especially kind of the aesthetic with the gigantic mini map in the corner.
4310101	4315707	And just like one small, like, really, it's just like the bottom half of the screen is the actual game.
4316048	4319071	I don't know why it gives me kind of Rygar vibes with the setup like that.
4319131	4320793	Because like Rygar, Rygar...
4320773	4325420	The game kind of takes place in a strip through the middle and the rest is all like UI.
4325900	4330928	But I did not know much about this game, but I'm kind of intrigued, I got to admit.
4331849	4339240	It's also that era of Namco artwork that I think led to the Cosmo Gang style is what I like to call it.
4339340	4340421	Yeah.
4340662	4346410	You know, the Cosmo Gang and the Point Blank style is that same art style.
4346693	4372448	And again, we did get, you know, Makaimura and
4372715	4377240	Oh yeah, now that guy's praying in front of a statue and was breathing fire.
4377260	4378081	That's pretty wild.
4378141	4381946	This is where you have Mon Motaro to play for you.
4382166	4382466	Huh.
4382827	4384008	This is really cool, though.
4384088	4386691	As far as a piece of gaming's history, I bet not a lot of people heard of this.
4387012	4389354	So you said this is on a PS2 anthology.
4389394	4395341	Is it on any of the NAMCO discs from back in the day?
4395361	4400427	The PS2 is that Tarosuke has an appearance
4400407	4402369	Oh, oh, my bad, my bad.
4403190	4408796	He's a character in Namco X Capcom and he's in Cameo and Project X Zone 2.
4408816	4410438	Okay, okay, that's right.
4410839	4413702	It was in the Arcade Archives and Virtual Console.
4414142	4415704	Oh, Arcade Archives, okay.
4416805	4418107	Exactly, exactly.
4418227	4421150	So, which of course is available for PS4 and up.
4421170	4423253	Yeah, yeah, no, Arcade Archives is great.
4423393	4425095	So, okay, that's a way you could play this then.
4425115	4426376	I might have to check that out.
4426396	4426656	Yeah.
4426676	4427037	Interesting.
4427738	4427818	Yep.
4427838	4428218	All right.
4428238	4429840	But yeah, it's...
4430090	4433600	It's a fun little one.
4433700	4435405	I've played a little bit of it.
4437110	4442867	It's just one of those games that I pick up and play for a little bit, and then I'm like, okay, I played it, and I don't think about it for another year.
4443151	4444052	No, cool pick, though.
4444192	4444573	I like that.
4444613	4446436	I might actually check that out on Arcade Archives.
4446456	4448058	So thank you.
4448078	4448398	All right.
4448518	4451342	Well, at this point, though, I must apologize.
4451803	4456510	I need to bid everybody adieu because my migraine is now at that point.
4456710	4457110	I got you.
4457130	4459374	I'm sorry to hear that, but I do hope you feel better.
4460075	4463880	And do you have any parting words or final thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go?
4465883	4469007	Killers be stinky in DVD, and I'm a stinky killer.
4469341	4488379	I still have not played this anniversary event I haven't I don't even think the game's installed oh no I lost access to it on PS5 I still have the Steam version though but yeah well then Rob play with me on Tuesday um maybe I gotta see what my schedule is this week but maybe I got a lot of stuff going on in my day job this week but maybe late at night
4488562	4489844	One last little thing.
4490124	4499555	We did Swan Lake yesterday, and I felt like I was a den mother hanging out backstage because I was only in two minutes of the dance because I had been injured when we started rehearsals.
4501517	4512190	But for every dancer out there, for everyone who does any kind of sport, make sure there is somebody with an equipped first aid kit and bring scissors.
4513182	4514644	That's it.
4514684	4517448	We try to have that when performing the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
4517508	4520512	That's a good idea for any situation with a lot of people.
4520593	4521374	Have a first aid kit.
4521394	4522916	But yes, yes.
4522936	4528303	And everyone owes it to themselves to at least be first aid certified at one point in their life.
4529746	4533511	Because you never know when that's going to save somebody's life or prevent a worse injury.
4533531	4535133	And that's what I have to leave everyone with.
4535153	4537416	The beat to CPR is staying alive.
4537797	4540641	Do do do do do do do do do do do.
4540840	4545835	There's a lot of other songs, but Stayin' Alive is the one that I remember because literally that's what you're doing.
4545895	4547861	That's what you're doing with CPR, so it's easier to remember.
4549506	4550048	All right.
4550228	4550971	Feel better, DarkSakura.
4550991	4551412	Have a good night.
4552556	4552876	Thank you.
4552897	4553398	Bye.
4553463	4559289	Alright, I knew other people would start saying other games and all that stuff.
4559670	4563154	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
4563414	4565697	We have a question in chat, actually.
4565757	4569841	Chat wants to know, what is the game that is playing behind you tonight on stream?
4569861	4576969	Because usually, as we're taping live at VOG Network, you have a game that plays behind you, which this looks like some type of Zelda clone.
4576989	4579172	Is that that Dungeon Maker game?
4579192	4579572	It doesn't...
4579552	4606015	I didn't think it was Legally distinct, excuse me, legally distinct Sure
4606214	4633960	hmm so yes it's just was this something they ran in the middle of the night at Summer Games Done Quick or something is that why it's in the bundle oh wow must have it must have been one of the games I haven't gotten a chance to check it out but yeah it certainly it looks like a link to the past for sure I didn't realize Humble Bundle was running a thing right now for Summer Games Done Quick um is it over at this point maybe no it's still going for another four days
4634007	4634515	Oh, nice.
4635653	4636710	I gotta try to find it.
4638412	4667136	I'm actually looking at their site right now to try to see what this is all about because I feel like oh there it is I feel like you know Humble Bundle just kind of turned into any other store at some point but I guess we can point out here real quick let's see they have okay leave me alone I hate these pop-ups they have yeah Collateral Damage that's a fun game oh Roller Coaster there's that Lena's Inception that you're talking about okay so they have like nine indie games for that that's kind of cute
4668162	4675052	Yeah, because Lenda's Inception itself is $10, and the bundle is basically $10 or more, so it makes sense.
4675293	4675593	All right.
4676795	4679459	Let's move on.
4679539	4683805	Let's get to some rapid-fire news and talk about some other things that are going on in the industry.
4683825	4685007	So, Loki, we'll go to you.
4685864	4698137	I guess this is silly, but GameStop is auctioning off for charity the stapler that ruined Nintendo Switch 2s in Staten Island.
4698257	4699738	This is so weird.
4699758	4704463	How desperate are they for money?
4704483	4705885	They're not even desperate for money.
4705925	4710910	It's desperate for attention because they're doing it for charity.
4711227	4713579	Oh, it's for charity?
4713719	4714986	Okay, then I'll let it go.
4715006	4717840	Yeah, it's for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.
4717860	4718262	Alright.
4718422	4719769	But, I mean...
4721707	4730316	If you really want to poo poo on their goodwill, which I'm always willing to do, it's a tax write off for them as well.
4731978	4736163	Would you like to round up your purchase today to save sick kids?
4736864	4739687	Would you like to round up your purchase today to feed hungry kids?
4740027	4743811	No, I would prefer billionaires feed them as opposed to you getting a tax write off.
4743871	4744592	Thank you.
4744910	4750962	Yeah, so as much as I like the idea of them raising money for taxes, this is just a big ol' attention thing.
4751543	4752365	Like, I don't know.
4752846	4755752	I just... I don't know.
4756353	4762084	I don't... I'd be surprised if this company lasts till 2030, let's be honest.
4762465	4762846	Fair enough.
4763367	4764589	What else do we have, Loki?
4765312	4772622	We also have Cyberpunk 2077 headed to July's PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5.
4773043	4774184	So that's pretty awesome.
4774905	4777068	PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
4777489	4792790	You get Cyberpunk 2077, Abiotic Factor, Banishers, Ghosts of New Eden, Bluey the video game, Planet Zoo, Risk of Rain 2, Tropico 6, and New World... I don't know.
4792910	4793511	It's a made-up name.
4793651	4794212	ATRM?
4794692	4795133	I don't know.
4795653	4803150	PlayStation Plus Premium is also getting some older games, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 as well.
4803170	4804195	Cool!
4806031	4806672	All right.
4806952	4809215	Well, let's talk about Summer Games Done Quick.
4809235	4817445	We were mentioning it earlier in the show, but we wanted to share with you the official total that was raised, which is $2,436,614.
4817805	4823792	And that was all raised, of course, for Doctors Without Borders.
4824533	4829138	It was pointed out that that was a little bit under what was raised in 2025.
4829179	4832983	That was $2.5 million that was raised in 2025.
4832963	4843287	But, you know, there's a million factors that could go into that, and certainly raising $2.4-plus million for an awesome charity, I don't think there's any way you can frame that as a bad thing.
4843848	4848559	I think there's just a lot of other things vying for attention now.
4848539	4856272	Summer Games and Awesome Games Done Quick did their best years when everybody was stuck at home during COVID and couldn't go out and do other things.
4856292	4859857	So I would say probably things that impact the weather.
4860559	4866328	If the weather is pretty nice out, people are probably going to be less inclined to stay at home and watch Games Done Quick.
4866308	4869415	It just depends what else is going on.
4870076	4872622	And there's other competition in the charity space as well.
4873003	4875408	A lot of people raising money for various charities.
4875428	4881482	But I still think it's really rad that Games Done Quick, all of these years later, because it's been going on for a while, can still raise...
4881462	4885726	Well over $2 million for the charity, which is great.
4886987	4892671	Did you know $50 million all time over that raised in the history of all the Games Done Quick marathon events?
4893152	4894693	So pretty cool.
4895454	4900578	Direct donations, but also partner donations, fan gammer.
4900638	4902960	Did I really just almost read fan gamer as fan gammer?
4903601	4904702	Y'all, I'm getting old.
4905462	4909346	The Yeti, fan gammer, where every gammer has a voice.
4909566	4911047	And the Humble Bundle.
4911483	4912725	were all part of that.
4912746	4917655	So that also explains their tie-in there was that they were a partner with Summer Games Done Quick.
4917675	4927195	Of course, Summer Games Done Quick had runs like Super Mario Maker 2, Mario Kart World, Deltarune, some of the newer games that were included towards the end there.
4928257	4928918	So yeah,
4928898	4932121	There's other speedruns that Games Done Quick does.
4932522	4942271	We know the big ones, but do you know that Flame Fatales 2025 called Survive Her this year is running from September 7th through 14th.
4942352	4946015	The schedule is available for that over at gamesdonequick.com.
4946716	4949479	So there's other things to look forward to throughout the year.
4949999	4958668	Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 will be held January 4th through 10th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
4959340	4964148	One other quick thing to share here, which is really sad news, unfortunately.
4964349	4969337	At the age of 71, we have lost James Carter Cathcart.
4969397	4973304	James Carter Cathcart was the voice of James in Pokemon.
4973765	4974225	Pretty big.
4974346	4976910	Also Meowth Professor Oak.
4976890	4977911	and much more.
4977951	4981075	But of course, some of those Pokemon characters are pretty legendary.
4981996	4985080	Fergus was also one of the roles in Pokemon, the first movie.
4986061	4990586	Snubbull in Pikachu's Vacation, which was the short that accompanied the original movie.
4991227	4994791	Also, he was Weevil Underwood in Yu-Gi-Oh!
4994811	4995632	Duel Monsters.
4996073	5004062	He was on Kirby Right Back At Ya, One Piece and Sonic X. He was also part of the credits for Sonic, or excuse me, Shadow the Hedgehog.
5004042	5029965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura

5122778	5130574	And finally, Shadow Labyrinth on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5131229	5139950	All righty, looking at Japan on the Nintendo Switch 2 this week, the big release, of course, Donkey Kong Bananas, which is out on July 17th.
5140011	5141474	That's a worldwide release, of course.
5141855	5146707	But we do also have Shadow Labyrinth is being released in Japan this week for the Switch 2.
5146687	5149470	and those are pretty much the only releases on Switch 2.
5149530	5171074	However, Switch 1 still seeing releases including Shadow Labyrinth getting its own version there as well as Snow Brothers Special, Distorted Code, Seija no Nokoriga also out on the 17th, Tevi in a multi-language release in Japan, also Busta Fellows Season 2, Hunter x Hunter and

5189279	5196989	and then Hunter x Hunter, Nen x Impact is also out in Japan this week, as well as Shadow Labyrinth and Tevi.
5197130	5204540	So a lot of those same games I was talking about, but also Dragon Ball Z Kakarot also out in Japan this week.
5204560	5205821	Those are your Japanese releases.
5206382	5209887	Since Jamie's not here, Loki, would you be willing to talk about the UK releases?

5315926	5318809	Impact on PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC.
5318849	5345578	So Ranma's telling us in chat that the X or cross is silent in Hunter, and I'm bitching about it's never consistent, because you have a title like Namco Cross Capcom, or then you have one where it's like, or Final Fantasy X, or it's the X means, or Final Fantasy X-2 specifically, not X-2, or you have something where it's, I'm trying to think of one where you actually do say X, Mortal Kombat X, like it's never fucking consistent, the usage of the X. I'm just gonna emphasize it even harder now.
5345558	5346379	is what I'm going to do.
5346820	5348282	Yeah.
5348302	5349524	Chunathem Crossverse.
5349564	5350486	Thank you, Ranmari.
5350947	5352169	Yeah, there you go.
5352469	5359080	Donkey Kong Bonanza on Switch 2, Forgotten 23 on PC, Phantom Squad on PC.
5359240	5361544	I read this completely wrong the first time.
5362065	5363968	It said, who's at the door?
5364088	5367413	I read that as who ate the door, which I was like, that's silly.
5367433	5368515	That's on PC as well.
5368735	5372882	And then Shadow Labyrinth on PC, Xbox Series X,
5372862	5375045	PlayStation 5, Switch, and Switch 2.
5375225	5377348	That is it.
5377368	5377909	All right.
5377929	5384297	Well, we're almost towards the part of the show where we'll take your calls over on our Discord server, but you should join our Discord server anyway.
5384317	5387001	You all have lovely conversations throughout the week.
5387081	5395853	That's over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and we will look to the green room to see if anybody wants to give us a chat later on.
5395913	5401080	But we do have one more story for you here, a very topical story from Loki.
5402258	5412573	Yes, and so, you know, Itch.io will do these different bundles for different charities and different things, usually stuff that's going on in the world.
5413174	5420344	So, you know, they did the bundle for racial justice, bundle for Ukraine, the California wildfires.
5420465	5425292	Well, now we have the No Ice in California Itch charity bundle.
5425893	5428236	500 games for a $10 donation.
5429057	5431000	That is...
5431655	5438423	basically going towards funding those, I guess, LA immigrants who are facing ICE invasions.
5440245	5440766	Topical.
5441567	5442588	Is Pixel Poops in it?
5443509	5445172	I know you were in one of these.
5445512	5449877	It was before in one of the other ones, but that's back when it cost something.
5449957	5452400	Remember, as a reminder, it is free forever now.
5452420	5453041	Oh, that's right.
5453061	5453341	That's right.
5453361	5454583	You made it free forever anyway.
5454663	5456025	So, yeah, nice.
5456425	5458708	So, I mean, yeah, you could put it in the bundle, but...
5458688	5460871	Yeah, it doesn't matter because it's free anyway, yeah.
5461051	5461411	Got it.
5461872	5463153	Yeah, no, I think that's a great deal.
5463173	5464615	Most of it's tabletop games, though.
5464635	5470802	They said 560 games that are in there, 427 of them are tabletop RPGs.
5470942	5472404	That's a lot of RPG.
5472464	5479512	Well, there's a lot of tabletop players out there, too, that, you know, might enjoy a little bit of diversity in their Friday night game club or whatever.
5479532	5484438	I like the games when they're talking about, like, which ones you should check out of the bundle.
5484578	5486841	One of them is Wrap Your Boyfriend, a high school romance.
5487161	5487261	Yeah.
5487663	5489526	It is exactly what you think it is.
5489546	5496215	Alright, well, definitely a worthy cause as far as I'm concerned.
5497137	5497717	Clever boy.
5498959	5501883	Alright, hope you'll check that out over on itch.io.
5502745	5512358	With that, we are towards the end of the show, but we want to open it up to any questions you might have for us in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
5512739	5513620	And I forgot...
5513600	5517470	Jamie is not here to do the mailbag so I'm going to try to bring that up real quick.
5518233	5521461	In the meantime, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
5522865	5525432	I do not, actually.
5525817	5528060	Sorry, there's no last minute stories.
5528080	5529882	I know, I feel like we don't have anything to talk about.
5529962	5535049	Like I said at the top of the show, it wasn't exactly a busy, busy week, all things considered.
5535069	5540817	But yeah, I do want to thank, so we didn't officially get like any emails to read tonight.
5541157	5548026	But I do want to thank, we got an email from E3VL who actually sent a code for me for the Pokemon trading card game.
5548326	5551150	I have to be honest, I kind of fell off the wagon with that.
5551130	5554198	But I'll still redeem the codes because you never know when I might get back on that wagon.
5554218	5555903	So I do appreciate you sending that along.
5555923	5559353	But I did kind of fall off the trading card game bandwagon at some point.
5559894	5560235	I don't know.
5561218	5564607	I don't know if I was just getting annoyed I kept getting so many repeats or what it was.
5564627	5566793	I just found another game to...
5566773	5567614	Break the cycle.
5567634	5568215	Who knows?
5568235	5568976	Who knows?
5568996	5575426	So, well, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaundradio.com is the place to do that.
5575767	5578972	So I guess otherwise, we'll wrap things up for tonight.
5579332	5582277	So I want to thank you all, of course, for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

5656700	5659532	Alright, with that, it's final thought time.
5659552	5660476	Loki, your final thought.
5662464	5666642	My final thought is that I'm going to be busy this week.
5667787	5669248	I have a lot of stuff to do.
5669348	5669889	Yeah, me too.
5669929	5670549	I got a lot.
5670950	5672271	But it'll be good.
5673272	5677576	My final thought is Fantasy Life 1.
5677596	5682740	I've got to keep, or I, whatever they call it, Fantasy Life, the girl that steals time.
5683501	5687905	I need to just focus and stop getting distracted by min-maxing everything.
5688005	5689907	But it's so hard in that game.
5689947	5691488	It's so hard!
5691508	5693930	Have a good night, everybody.
5693950	5694791	We'll see you next time.
