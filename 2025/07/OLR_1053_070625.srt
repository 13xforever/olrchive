1
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:12,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, an advocacy group made up of AAA publishers.

2
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:15,159
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, many titles are designed from the ground up to be online only.

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,864
[SPEAKER_06]: These proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.

4
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:27,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure games have only gotten more expensive since the era of GameSpy, and taking on 100% of the server costs makes it cost more than the alternative, not less.

5
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:30,116
[SPEAKER_06]: This intro has not been brought to you by a Mind's Eye Saboteur.

6
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:35,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this initiative and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:38,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:56,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1053 for tonight, July the 6th of 2025.

11
00:00:57,452 --> 00:00:59,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't believe we're already in July.

12
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as I saw in a post the other day that was very hateful, we are now closer to 2050.

13
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:53,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I think okay I guess so yeah cool I mean I'm hoping I can go kind of we sort of blip didn't blip it on the radar I think so right now it is what it is yeah I gotcha I gotcha uh all right well we'll go say hello uh next off to the one and only Techmaster Loki hello hi Loki how are you

15
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, apparently I have a splinter in my finger.

16
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:57,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know where it came from.

17
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I've touched no wood at all.

18
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: The closest thing to wood was I picked up my... Can't say the same, but I'm bummed.

19
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:08,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

21
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that better not be splintering.

22
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing Fantasy Life and I'm working on crafting.

23
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,580
[SPEAKER_03]: What on earth are you talking about, Loki?

24
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:23,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I was referring to my playthrough of Fantasy Life.

25
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:24,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, well, I hope I'm sorry to hear you got a splinter.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Just blame it on the cat.

28
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: When in doubt, blame it on the cat.

29
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:33,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get it out?

30
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

31
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:36,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super tiny.

32
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:42,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like one of those ones that doesn't hurt, but occasionally you'll brush it, and then you feel that it's there.

33
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,386
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like it's painful, it's just like it's there.

34
00:02:47,406 --> 00:02:49,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what it tends to be a lot of the times?

35
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,876
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a splinter, it ends up being a beard hair that gets jammed into my...

36
00:02:55,042 --> 00:03:11,548
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

37
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:15,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you trim.

38
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:37,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you trim the murder mittens.

39
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:41,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to need to get one of those freaking slings where they can't do anything until they get you.

40
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the only way we're going to be able to train them.

41
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Rob.

42
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:44,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the vet.

43
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me do it.

44
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want to come?

45
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:50,481
[SPEAKER_03]: May the odds be ever in your favor.

46
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:58,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I will show you how to two-person cut the death mittens.

47
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:59,053
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

48
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be curious to see that.

49
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I do mittens on my own.

50
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Midna probably cooperates a little more than ours.

51
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,012
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she doesn't.

52
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:16,618
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a hissy little bitch, and she bats her paws around, and she doesn't try to eat my arm, bite me, but she'll snap.

53
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:25,752
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm curious about besides cat grooming tips is Loki has a video game playing behind him tonight.

54
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:31,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

55
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

56
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Except Bobby Blackwolf's not on tonight.

57
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:43,749
[SPEAKER_03]: He is already out at Summer Games Done Quick, which we'll bring up again later in the show.

58
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,070
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you...

59
00:04:45,050 --> 00:05:09,825
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

60
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:38,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Warzone, clearly

61
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:42,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Beavis and Butthead Super Nintendo or Genesis?

62
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Super Nintendo because I just saw it do the pixelation effect.

63
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:48,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I maybe rented this game once.

64
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:49,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not remember it.

65
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,553
[SPEAKER_03]: What brought this game to mind tonight, Loki?

66
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:12,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty Warzone Beavis and Butthead

67
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:31,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Skydance

68
00:06:31,447 --> 00:07:00,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know they've been talking about that stuff but I don't know I can't follow the drama in my own life let alone the South Park creators over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network we do tape live of course on Sunday nights and Ranmari in chat bringing up an old reference saying Super Metroid greater than and then cut off there with Chrono Trigger and I hope you all know by now the real answer is

69
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:02,359
[SPEAKER_03]: There's room in my heart for both.

70
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,369
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's this long-running, I don't even know if I'd call it an in-joke because jokes are funny, but that Super Metroid is better than Chrono Trigger or vice versa.

71
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby strongly believes the other.

72
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,832
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just call it a meme by now.

73
00:07:12,952 --> 00:07:13,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a meme.

74
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:15,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess a meme is a good way to put it.

75
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do find the humor in the fact that Bobby Blackwolf is hosting the Super Metroid speed run because in that argument, he would always say, no, Chrono Trigger is the best Super Nintendo game ever made.

76
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I always said Super Metroid.

77
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:36,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I do find it funny that with all that back and forth, now he gets to do the Super Metroid run and has to be the hype guy for that run.

78
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is, you know, I'm enjoying this even sitting at home.

79
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer Games done quick so far.

80
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:50,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Rinmari also says in chat, clearly we need a ROM hack that mashes both games up.

81
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,072
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that could totally be a thing.

82
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:54,394
[SPEAKER_03]: They do those randomizers.

83
00:07:54,454 --> 00:08:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing that one once upon a time that was Metroid and The Legend of Zelda, the original, where you would go into a dungeon in Zelda and you'd turn up in Metroid and then you'd go down an elevator in Metroid and now you're back in Zelda.

84
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:11,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cool concept, but my brain could not handle the randomy.

85
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making up a new word, the randomy in those games.

86
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that.

87
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,622
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

88
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of interesting stuff going on with this petition around the Stop Killing Games movement.

89
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, are you up to speed on what's going on with this?

90
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:32,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

91
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:35,915
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of drama involved with it.

92
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:47,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking the drama out of it, there was another push by a lot of content creators and whatnot to get the petition over the line.

93
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:56,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've essentially had a petition with the UK and I think the EU regarding...

94
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess in their process with Parliament, you put a petition together, it reaches a million signers, that then they discuss it on the floor of Parliament or just bring up the topic essentially.

95
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:17,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean it's going into law, it's more of like bringing it before them to discuss whether...

96
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:21,844
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to talk about the issue.

97
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:23,688
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't just avoid it.

98
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:28,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one that got associated with the crew, right?

99
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Ubisoft sunsetted the original crew, and this petition started going around for, you know, which is labeled Stop Killing Games, which is essentially to...

100
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:46,627
[SPEAKER_03]: hold companies liable to when they sell these games, they need to keep servers open or they need to allow people to have their own private servers.

101
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,612
[SPEAKER_03]: There needs to be a way for the game to be able to be able to be continued.

102
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:58,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, you shouldn't be buying a game you can only play for three years or in the case of some games, a lot less time.

103
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's at the root of all this.

104
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:04,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in case you're not aware of what this petition is all about.

105
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:19,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and so they did manage to get over the one million signature mark, but because there is a risk that people might be spoofing signatures on the internet, even though these these are government forms, though, so that is a crime.

106
00:10:19,376 --> 00:10:22,402
[SPEAKER_03]: People signing things, see more butts on the internet.

107
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:23,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding?

108
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:24,426
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

109
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:28,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so... Or Cord Holio, I'm on theme, Loki.

110
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: They're looking to get more signatures than what's required just to account for any that may be thrown out for not being correctly signed or invalid stuff.

111
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're working on that.

112
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So the EU one has crossed.

113
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:47,071
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still waiting for more signatures on the UK one.

114
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

115
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah, and so there's been kind of back and forth with that.

116
00:10:53,479 --> 00:11:11,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there was an advocacy group for major gaming studios that have basically pushed back on it, saying private servers are not always viable alternatives, options for players, the protections we put in place to secure players' data, remove illegal content.

117
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:13,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Combat Unsafe Community, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

118
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the UK's version of the ESA speaking.

119
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're pushing back on it saying, basically what I'm hearing is, one, it's too hard.

120
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:23,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, it's too expensive.

121
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:31,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, it would cause game publishers to not do this anymore, which is kind of, I think, I thought what people wanted.

122
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, but...

123
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:36,018
[SPEAKER_03]: As an advocacy group, they're going to respond.

124
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Live service game.

125
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:38,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're the ones doing it.

126
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:48,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I have a hard time believing that companies that make billions of dollars off of microtransactions can't afford to create an end of life plan for their game.

127
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:49,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

128
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:49,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

129
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:50,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

130
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:56,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, okay, so what's interesting is there is some sort of prominent streamer out there.

131
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:57,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

132
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know these streamers.

133
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:01,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, I do.

134
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:01,926
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's Thor.

135
00:12:01,946 --> 00:12:03,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Pirate Software.

136
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,311
[SPEAKER_07]: He's big in the scene.

137
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,154
[SPEAKER_07]: He ex-Blizzard dev.

138
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:13,623
[SPEAKER_07]: His dad was the WoW guy from the South Park episode.

139
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:18,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, his dad was at Blizzard before Blizzard was Blizzard, so that type of thing.

140
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:27,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's been outspoken about it because he is a game developer, and he has said that for smaller indie studios...

141
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:37,030
[SPEAKER_07]: These requirements may be too much for them to handle, and so also pushing back on some of the more finer details.

142
00:12:37,071 --> 00:12:40,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, though, I mean, I'm trying to just put it this way.

143
00:12:40,836 --> 00:12:43,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I was just thinking about this earlier over dinner, actually.

144
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:50,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not only would stop, you know, protecting games and stuff like that and just layoffs and all this stuff.

145
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:50,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like...

146
00:12:52,028 --> 00:13:06,493
[SPEAKER_07]: more and more in the world like it's hard to find joy in things that we're doing like the world around us seems to be a chaotic mess that is just ever so crushing us down by it and then now we have like the game industry stuff where

147
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,640
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just treating people as disposable.

148
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Corporations treating people like nothing.

149
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:17,780
[SPEAKER_07]: All of it down for the bottom line of their shareholders.

150
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really their only concern about anything.

151
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

152
00:13:24,327 --> 00:13:24,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the fun?

153
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we find the fun again?

154
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I would like.

155
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I get it that there could be some challenges, but once again, I think that would be more something that's hammered out when they consider that as a law.

156
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:39,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there are some exceptions.

157
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:41,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's only for certain size companies.

158
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:44,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's for whatever.

159
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:59,295
[SPEAKER_07]: typically though I find that a lot of folks see or understand a bit more that if a smaller game studio is unable to keep a title going it's a little more understandable versus like

160
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:13,708
[SPEAKER_07]: and EA that keeps releasing games year after year after year and then they shut the servers off after a few years because that fight night wasn't doing well or whatever the case may be.

161
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:14,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's

162
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:31,240
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a little bit more understandable there but once again any smaller indie game studios I don't think necessarily are making these big always online games always online games anyways so like I don't know well and I see

163
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,162
[SPEAKER_03]: chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

164
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:37,307
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says, Pirate Software, he's earned the ire of the gaming community out there.

165
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did notice that, too, that this guy's been getting a lot of hate.

166
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:42,854
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also a bit rude as well.

167
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I don't know the guy, and if he has an unpopular opinion, then so be it.

168
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But people on the internet need to calm the fuck down sometimes.

169
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:51,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

170
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:54,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody's going to agree with you all the time.

171
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I like him.

172
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't necessarily agree with his opinion.

173
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But once again, it's fine to have differing opinions.

174
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:07,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the how does this affect indie and small developers is a fair counterpoint.

175
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:08,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it is.

176
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:09,346
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fair counterpoint.

177
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:14,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it changes my feelings that something has to be done, especially with large shows.

178
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:16,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an idea, but I'll let you finish, Loki.

179
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:17,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an idea, though.

180
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:25,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, essentially though, they're blaming him for the stalling of the movement in the first place because he's such a prominent figure.

181
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But I get it, it's fine to have differing opinions.

182
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:41,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also, maybe people may not be on board with your opinion as much when you tell them to eat your entire ass when it comes to these things.

183
00:15:41,662 --> 00:15:43,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You are going to get what you give, yeah.

184
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:46,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a little, you know, I get it.

185
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:47,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

186
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:51,374
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and this would directly affect you if it were to go into place.

187
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:53,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's like realistically look at this.

188
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:54,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this going to happen?

189
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:57,144
[SPEAKER_07]: God, no, nothing good ever happens.

190
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, of course, it's never going to go through.

191
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:05,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, it's still nice to try to at least show these, you know, game companies that we're not going to put up with this crap.

192
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,060
Yeah.

193
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:11,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's kind of where my brain is going with, like, how do we resolve this whole thing?

194
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:32,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to fully admit, I'm speaking off the cuff here, and I haven't fully thought these out, and I'm sure y'all are ready to poke holes in this, but this is the direction my brain is kind of going in, because I'm thinking that what tends to happen is that you have these large companies, especially a Nintendo out there, that really likes to legally sort of

195
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,400
[SPEAKER_03]: claim the protections on games, even if they're games that are no longer sold, no longer out there or whatever.

196
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually in Nintendo's case, at least, it happens to do with trademark because they don't want Mario to end up in porn and things like that.

197
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:50,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have to protect their trademark, I guess, on Mario and things like that.

198
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's kind of what the other bigger companies lean on.

199
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:58,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think smaller companies or indie companies as much are going to be

200
00:16:58,032 --> 00:17:03,199
[SPEAKER_03]: leaning on intellectual property to sort of save themselves as a game doesn't do very well.

201
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:13,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think most Indian small studios are of the mindset that if, you know, a fan movement wants to try to save the game, then so be it.

202
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:20,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, I think the answer sort of lies in the

203
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: is that when you take these games offline that you have been selling, they should not really have the same types of enforceable sort of copyright and trademark protections on them that would allow people who legally own the game to do things like put the discs in a PC, decompile, do what they need to do to be able to run a private server on their own terms.

204
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,968
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be able to do that without those sorts of fear of repercussions.

205
00:17:47,948 --> 00:17:54,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a similar concept to what I've said before on this program about, you know, Hollywood's been doing this a lot, right?

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Zaslav and Warner Brothers, you know, that Catwoman movie that, no, it wasn't Cat, no, it was Catwoman.

207
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Catwoman.

208
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:01,772
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Batgirl.

209
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:02,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Batgirl.

210
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,998
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the Catwoman movie came out, it was terrible, it was Batgirl.

211
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:06,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to come out and was...

212
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently not bad, but the whole thing ended up being a tax write-off.

213
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:14,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the Coyote and Acme, which I guess is now actually getting released.

214
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: The same company that did the recent Porky Pay.

215
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:20,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was in limbo for a while.

216
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:24,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they get to write that off still?

217
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:24,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

218
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,470
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they sold it?

219
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds like fraud.

220
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:47,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have always said if you are a company like that and you are writing off on your taxes, you are paying less taxes, you are not giving the public, you are saying we're not using this piece of media so essentially that piece of media ought to belong to the public.

221
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my long-handed way of saying Batgirl ought to be a public domain film.

222
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,709
[SPEAKER_03]: at this point because it was a tax write-off.

223
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Batgirl ought to be a public domain film.

224
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be the cause and the effect so it really causes companies like Warner Brothers to think about should we be doing these as tax write-offs because this will be something that is in the hands of the public domain.

225
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:11,324
[SPEAKER_07]: They shouldn't even be getting tax write-offs anyways for that stuff.

226
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:15,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, in my opinion, why are we bailing out these billion-dollar companies?

227
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:20,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, because... I mean...

228
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:41,706
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

229
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:46,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, E3VL says actors and those that work on it don't get the royalties though, but they're not getting it with the tax write-offs either.

230
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,998
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not getting anything right now.

231
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:50,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

232
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I fully realize these are theories.

233
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:58,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the type to throw something out on a social media site and say that's all there is to it.

234
00:19:58,712 --> 00:19:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nuance in everything.

235
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: These are ideas that have to be baked out a little more, but I think the answer is rooted in that, if that makes sense.

236
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:09,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the answer to this is somewhat rooted in that too.

237
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I mean is, let's say that you have a large studio that puts out a big game, a Concord, let's say.

238
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And you sign that, you digitally sign the EULA.

239
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:25,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you connect to one of these games as a service game, anytime you do it, you're accepting some type of agreement, right?

240
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You're accepting an online agreement and all this stuff.

241
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:30,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And it basically says, you won't try to hack the game.

242
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:32,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't try to do your own servers.

243
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only allowed to play on their servers only, da-da-da-da-da, and all this stuff.

244
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:43,284
[SPEAKER_03]: When the servers for a game get pulled, that online agreement should be null and void.

245
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:44,786
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be the first thing that happens.

246
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:51,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the corporation has not held up their end of the bargain.

247
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,068
[SPEAKER_03]: So that agreement that you agreed to should be null and void.

248
00:20:56,148 --> 00:21:07,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that would include at that point that if you want to run your own pirate servers, decompile whatever needs to be done, I think that's what should happen.

249
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:09,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I understand with this whole effort, they want...

250
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

251
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:56,959
[SPEAKER_03]: and with Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst when they when Sega shut it down and they shut down the servers they put out a tool so that your characters could be exported and they basically they didn't I don't think they put out the software correct me if I'm wrong Jamie because I don't remember I didn't follow the ins and outs of it I don't think they put out the software for people to run their own servers but they basically said if you run your own server we're gonna turn a blind eye to the whole thing we're not gonna look at it and they did you know some tools

252
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a character export tool.

253
00:21:59,482 --> 00:22:00,803
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the main thing I remember.

254
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But to this day, there are still Blue Burst servers running on out there.

255
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:07,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else is out there?

256
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is funny because this ties into my gaming week.

257
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:12,297
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I've been playing?

258
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:26,473
[SPEAKER_03]: On a GameCube emulator, I've been playing Phantasy Star Online Volume 1 and 2 because you can actually, in the config files, you route the broadband adapter to a different IP and there are PSO private servers for that as well.

259
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:29,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do that with my Dreamcast version.

260
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's a really good question.

261
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet there's documentation on those sites how to do it.

262
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:35,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you could.

263
00:22:35,705 --> 00:22:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's probably something to do with setting up the DNS servers or something to do that.

264
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:40,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

265
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, TigerClaw points out in chat, Sega's the only company that doesn't mind modders and fan games based on their IPs.

266
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:53,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying that Sega did kind of put a blueprint out there for, I think, what gamers are really looking for the companies to do.

267
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:59,667
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're folding, if you're throwing in the cards, then you should release some of those, you know,

268
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:11,311
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not going to, I mean, I guess I can see where they shouldn't be compelled to or obligated to, especially if these companies end up laying off employees and stuff that would, you know, be putting that stuff out.

269
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:19,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it should be open so that if people do that on their own means, there should be no ability for the company to have legal recourse against that.

270
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying at the end of the day.

271
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:27,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, if a company shuts the game down, they have no legal recourse to go after people trying to protect their investments.

272
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,873
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the long and the short of what I'm trying to say.

273
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:35,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I think... I'm trying to remember what...

274
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:42,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the scenarios that they were proposing are like how it could be abused.

275
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:49,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, though, like you're putting the cart before the horse as far as like trying to figure out how a system like this would be before the system's even in place.

276
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:59,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one thing the video game, you know, group in the UK said was that, oh, it would it would lead to like bullying, harassment and those types.

277
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that shit already happens in games.

278
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:18,642
[SPEAKER_07]: that kind of felt a little bit like reaching to me you know what I mean like they can't protect the integrity of the servers and things like that and it's like you're right you can't and I mean like okay so after it's offline and I get it so they'll be like oh well if someone gets bullied on like say uh

279
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:22,227
[SPEAKER_07]: on an Ubisoft game that's discontinued.

280
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:23,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it makes the game look bad.

281
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:32,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that makes our game look bad because now that headline runs on Fox News that says a six-year-old child was bullied playing the crew.

282
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,824
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to do it anyways.

283
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:37,169
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to do it anyways.

284
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:41,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It's dumb to assume that people are so brain-dead that they're going to...

285
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:42,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then fine.

286
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,599
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't have it both ways then.

287
00:24:44,619 --> 00:25:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're too brain dead to be able to realize that the game that's discontinued that they have to play through a private server is not the same game as when it was running, but also they are intelligent enough to be able to set up their game so they can connect to a private server to play said game.

288
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you can't have it both ways.

289
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:06,685
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't be...

290
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:08,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Smart enough, but not also dumb.

291
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's silly.

292
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say at the end of the day, I support this movement.

293
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:22,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why is because I think for years and years and years, the corporations have been setting the rules.

294
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:35,252
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ubisofts, the EAs, hell, the Square Enixes, the, you know, the Nintendos have been setting the rules because they put out these user agreements and you have to agree to it to play the game.

295
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:36,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, that's it.

296
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:37,335
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, you don't have a choice.

297
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:38,977
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get a say on what's in that.

298
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:39,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't get it.

299
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:46,689
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this is the people saying, all right, for years you have said this is what you want and you've set the rules.

300
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:47,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know what?

301
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,834
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we want.

302
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:53,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are our rules that you need to agree to.

303
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's fair.

304
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:58,388
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why my youngest son agreed to all of those terms so it doesn't bind legally.

305
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's outside the box thinking.

306
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:23,044
[SPEAKER_03]: but yes, I think it's time for us to have the corporations sign some agreements quite honestly and if it means that they need to follow any of those agreements if it means they need to think twice before they decide a game needs to always be online, then so be it

307
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:41,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they should eat themselves and what I mean by that is because right now in the court system we have a battle between AI generators and the data, totally legal that they've trained their stuff off of and then we have

308
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:48,887
[SPEAKER_07]: These companies where they've clearly been inspired by and totally not stolen all of the data from.

309
00:26:49,848 --> 00:27:03,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you had, what was it, already legally, there was a court case that allowed physical books to be scanned in and used for training data completely 100% legally.

310
00:27:03,943 --> 00:27:06,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can go to my library and

311
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:12,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Borrow all these books, scan them in for my training data, and just create AI off of that.

312
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally legal.

313
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:18,908
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing that's going to keep coming to a head in courts.

314
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:25,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's some court cases that have already been decided, but I think that's a whole other issue.

315
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it does all come down to copyright ownership issues.

316
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, usage rights, all of that.

317
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:37,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like all of that was written in an era before the internet.

318
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been struggling to catch up ever since.

319
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:46,998
[SPEAKER_03]: As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says it at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, consumer protection is still trying to catch up to gaming, I guess.

320
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:47,319
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

321
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,581
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

322
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:51,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of other types of new media, too.

323
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still trying to catch up with AI.

324
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still trying to catch up with streaming.

325
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll get to a point where it's too much for people.

326
00:27:58,576 --> 00:27:59,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

327
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:10,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Gamers, especially gamers of long-running franchises, Madden, FIFA, essentially just get beaten down every year with the microtransactions.

328
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people are completely...

329
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:42,921
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

330
00:28:43,610 --> 00:29:07,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.

331
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:14,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well on that note, let's continue on because obviously we have some other big headlines we need to get to.

332
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:20,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, we always like to start off in talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

333
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, DarkSakura's back, so I will start with DarkSakura and go, how was your gaming week?

334
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:26,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're good.

335
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:29,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some real life stuff going on.

336
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:29,393
[SPEAKER_02]: All good.

337
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:34,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the usual stuff.

338
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, Dead by Daylight, trying to get through the event.

339
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:42,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Palia, that's about it.

340
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:43,955
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

341
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:44,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

342
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:46,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll go to you then.

343
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,721
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

344
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:50,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing mainly Minecraft.

345
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:51,957
[SPEAKER_07]: As usual, I know it's shocking.

346
00:29:52,878 --> 00:30:00,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We updated to 121.6 this week, so we have the happy gas now and just kind of messing with that stuff.

347
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been building a massive battle arena for our sleep game.

348
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:36,270
[SPEAKER_07]: that will be participating in here pretty soon so I've been just kind of designing and now gathering materials for that thing working on my mega game stuff as well to start the whole early design process part of that and then aside from that a tiny bit of Bellatro and yeah just looking at my Steam library it's like yeah I could play all these games I'll buy more but I'm not going to play them

349
00:30:37,043 --> 00:31:06,055
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a problem I have a problem, I will admit I have the same problem but you know what though, I like it I like having that library because it does give me the option that I can go in there someday and play that stuff it's kind of like realistically, if I were to collect physical games I have no place to put that stuff I don't know anything about that of course you wouldn't

350
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:20,398
[SPEAKER_07]: but like yeah it's just not all over my kitchen and the offices and under pinball tables it's just like even my collection that I have I don't actually play them um

351
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:49,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know I like to support smaller game studios I like to purchase games that look interesting I get it I will eventually get to them at some point I can't say that about my whole library because there's like 1200 now someday when I give up Minecraft I'll dig into the Steam library but until then I'm going to consume more and how and how

352
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:49,909
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

353
00:31:50,229 --> 00:31:53,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we get to my gaming week... Now with more sodium.

354
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:57,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to my gaming week, Jamie, let me know... Go ahead and do your gaming week.

355
00:31:57,602 --> 00:31:58,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

356
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:00,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Then for my gaming week, let me think.

357
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a lot of the same sorts of things.

358
00:32:03,772 --> 00:32:06,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm still playing Fantasy Life, still very addicted to that.

359
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:13,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 4 started a new season, so Season 9, which does this new twist with Nightmare Dungeons.

360
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:30,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo IV Diablo VIII

361
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:46,562
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

362
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:47,203
[SPEAKER_03]: D.A.B.O.

363
00:32:47,243 --> 00:33:08,382
[SPEAKER_03]: 4

364
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:35,061
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

365
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:43,914
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I know PSO2 is still a thing, and I tried to do PSO2, but I feel like PSO2 has like a content overload problem.

366
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:51,225
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be fair, I haven't visited it in a long time since it first came out on Xbox, and maybe it's a little better now.

367
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:54,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should try to check it out again just to make sure I give it a fair shot.

368
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was kind of the issue I had with it.

369
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Compartmentalized, if that makes sense.

370
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:04,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like PSO is really easy to kind of, I think something about maybe the simplification.

371
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I keep, I'm trying to always use the right stick on my controller, which didn't exist, right?

372
00:34:09,945 --> 00:34:12,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you always had to hit the L button to like reset your view.

373
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:14,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just having to get used to that again.

374
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing where I'm like, oh yeah, I forgot that this was a thing on the old PSO.

375
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:20,134
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I love it.

376
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:24,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SS200Matt says, gotta soup up the computer just to play Space Cadet Pinball on Windows.

377
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:26,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that's what I feel like I've been doing.

378
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Like brand new video card

379
00:34:27,421 --> 00:34:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCube emulators.

380
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:31,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

381
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:33,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I could totally play too.

382
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:35,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you should.

383
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:35,973
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

384
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be a fun stream to do sometime.

385
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:38,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the means.

386
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:40,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Play some PSO.

387
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do it.

388
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:41,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

389
00:34:42,783 --> 00:34:43,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

390
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

391
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:44,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that all for my gaming week?

392
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:45,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

393
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:49,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if there's something else, I can't think of it in the moment.

394
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:57,571
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, then with that, before we get to the news, Jamie, you said you need to cut out a little early tonight because you have some stuff going on IRL, which happens.

395
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:06,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to fast forward a little bit and get to your segment because, you know, once a month, you don't just do a classic game of the week.

396
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:11,348
[SPEAKER_03]: You do a classic game that is going to go to the arcades or has gone to the arcades.

397
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:12,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's roll the bump.

398
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Console first, arcade second.

399
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:30,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

400
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:35,398
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

401
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jamie, what is the console to arcade game of this month?

402
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero.

403
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick.

404
00:35:44,253 --> 00:36:06,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean we know Guitar Hero, the franchise has been out for a while and then died and then there were hints of it coming back and I mean the first one was out in 2005 so it is more than a classic game but the one that I am talking about is the...

405
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:17,190
[SPEAKER_02]: After a number of expansions mined, Activision and Red Octane put in some work with a company called Basic Fun Inc.

406
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:24,624
[SPEAKER_02]: to do guitar... I said the wrong words.

407
00:36:24,805 --> 00:36:28,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision and Konami...

408
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Arcade

409
00:36:47,838 --> 00:37:04,395
[SPEAKER_02]: but it reduced some of the features like the whammy bar, star power button you can only activate it by lifting the guitar so you have limited use there and practice modes but you could still download new songs for the cabinet from the internet

410
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:28,206
[SPEAKER_02]: and the game though did come under some scrutiny by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, the ASCAP who thought that it qualified as the equivalent of public performances and that the game operators needed to pay royalties, additional fees and

411
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:57,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Alas, it was not meant to be Alas

412
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,364
[SPEAKER_03]: All asked.

413
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:06,295
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those games where you knew it had to come up eventually, but I don't know.

414
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:08,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't love it in the arcade.

415
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,628
[SPEAKER_02]: No, neither did I. But it's worth the mention.

416
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:14,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just...

417
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:33,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we...

418
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:39,943
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have a ton of Guitadora, and we had the Triumvirate, you remember?

419
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:43,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure, but it was never going to catch on mainstream until they got... But they didn't do it in the U.S.

420
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:43,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

421
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to do Guitar Freaks in the U.S., remember?

422
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Rock Revolution.

423
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:49,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not...

424
00:38:50,182 --> 00:38:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

425
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about in the arcade.

426
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:53,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

427
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:54,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, they did.

428
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:54,890
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

429
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:55,251
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

430
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,493
[SPEAKER_03]: They did do one version in the arcade.

431
00:38:56,694 --> 00:39:04,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, there's that and then there's like these actual like, you know, guitar songs that everybody heard growing up, you know?

432
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:13,647
[SPEAKER_02]: As Ranmari points out, Round 1 USA just got the new Gitarra cabs and fancy new 3-screen deluxe cabinets in their U.S.

433
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:14,269
[SPEAKER_02]: region.

434
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:24,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is true, because the nice thing is that Round 1 has sort of brought back, or at least kind of opened the door, I guess, to...

435
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:30,456
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese games being imported, you know, legally, quote unquote, although it was like it was always a gray area.

436
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the thing that I wanted to go back to was that, you know, especially in bringing up Guitadora is that they were originally arcade that went to the home, you know, the home consoles.

437
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:49,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Guitar Hero came out for the home consoles as we tested in my living room at my old house.

438
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

439
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:53,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't there, but you guys were.

440
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: and then to arcade after that.

441
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sort of like it went full circle from there.

442
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:02,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the way things are, people want to play these things in their home and make a party out of it.

443
00:40:02,982 --> 00:40:08,770
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't necessarily want to go to an arcade where people try to change their baby's diaper on the keyboard mania table.

444
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that story is still on YouTube, by the way, for some of our newer OLR fans.

445
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:15,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you dig on the...

446
00:40:16,177 --> 00:40:17,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Told the woman off?

447
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,760
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.

448
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Guitar Hero at your house.

449
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:30,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't there, but you and Loki were on one of the local news stations because didn't they bring the fucking guy from Red Octane to your house?

450
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

451
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made me hide all my Bimani stuff.

452
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:35,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

453
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:39,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to hide all your Konami stuff.

454
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the Bimani stuff.

455
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:43,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's so funny.

456
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had a guy from here.

457
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:49,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, yeah, so it's out there on YouTube somewhere.

458
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:50,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost positive.

459
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw is probably looking for it right now.

460
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:54,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had all this stuff in the corner of my living room.

461
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on our Orange Lounge Radio YouTube channel, actually.

462
00:40:56,329 --> 00:41:05,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that one and the old KCRA clip of Dave Walker, who retired years ago, introducing the story of podcasting.

463
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:09,409
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the infamous, oh, it's so much fun, clip of you.

464
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:10,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

465
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have our newspaper.

466
00:41:14,075 --> 00:41:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the newspaper article too.

467
00:41:15,637 --> 00:41:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

468
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when we were famous?

469
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

470
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:20,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're infamous.

471
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:21,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

472
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get the Guinness book.

473
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:26,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I can't complain because we did get the Guinness book last year, so I can't bitch too much.

474
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,714
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

475
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Even chat GPT recognizes it now.

476
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say that.

477
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess that's... I never thought to ask, but it's good.

478
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put the clip in chat.

479
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:38,109
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

480
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:40,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you found it!

481
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:41,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on our YouTube channel.

482
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was on our YouTube somewhere.

483
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:49,439
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the original KCRA thing.

484
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:51,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's my old TV!

485
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:56,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, it's my chin!

486
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:58,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just fast-forwarding through it.

487
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Matt, you look so young.

488
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:04,045
[SPEAKER_03]: How old was this?

489
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're going to make me bring it up while we're live here.

490
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:08,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

491
00:42:08,672 --> 00:42:09,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got to look at this.

492
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:20,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny?

493
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

494
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see my drum mania.

495
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:26,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It behind the TV.

496
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:31,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I was coming from work, that's why I had a work shirt on.

497
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And my 2DX stuff.

498
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:37,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't there because, oh yeah, that's the old Red Octane guy.

499
00:42:38,112 --> 00:42:43,321
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... I wasn't able to go at all because I was working that night.

500
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that day.

501
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:48,491
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an old, old clip.

502
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:49,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

503
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:51,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad I had my surgery.

504
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:51,556
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

505
00:42:51,677 --> 00:42:51,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

506
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:52,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

507
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:53,540
[SPEAKER_03]: That's enough of Walk Down Memory Lane.

508
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, podcast.

509
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:57,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to... It is on the Orange Nose Radio YouTube channel.

510
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to go way back.

511
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort by oldest.

512
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:01,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.

513
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:05,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Just put DarkSakura, Loki, Guitar Hero, you'll find it.

514
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:07,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in it, so don't search me.

515
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:09,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go to the Orange Lounge Radio YouTube channel.

516
00:43:10,189 --> 00:43:11,811
[SPEAKER_07]: There's three buttons on there.

517
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:12,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Click oldest.

518
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll sort by oldest.

519
00:43:14,396 --> 00:43:14,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, there you go.

520
00:43:14,977 --> 00:43:17,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, because all the actual podcast episodes are mixed in now.

521
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Be right.

522
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:18,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You sort oldest.

523
00:43:18,923 --> 00:43:19,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be there.

524
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:20,766
[SPEAKER_03]: How to internet one-on-one.

525
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:21,347
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

526
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:21,808
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

527
00:43:21,828 --> 00:43:23,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have Dance Dance Revolution Wii on there.

528
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:25,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have to go.

529
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:27,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a final thought for us?

530
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:30,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugh, fuck.

531
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:30,575
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

532
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just... Alright.

533
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:40,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna eat this lovely muffin that Alan brought for me while Loki gets into our news story today.

534
00:43:40,863 --> 00:43:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

535
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:42,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

536
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:43,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Muffin!

537
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go have a protein shake.

538
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:47,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, have fun.

539
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:49,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye!

540
00:43:49,788 --> 00:43:54,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so Loki, we're gonna go over to you with... Oops, not that one, this one.

541
00:43:54,554 --> 00:43:56,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna go over to you with the news for tonight.

542
00:43:56,516 --> 00:44:00,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to our top headline, which unfortunately is not something to consume a muffin to.

543
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually really shitty news.

544
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:04,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it not time for muffins?

545
00:44:04,968 --> 00:44:07,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for depression and sadness.

546
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Depression muffin!

547
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Video game industry layoff muffin!

548
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it was confirmed that Microsoft was laying off about 9,000 jobs, 9,100 jobs if you want to be more ballpark about that.

549
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It is hitting a wide variety of their different studios.

550
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,755
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a memo that they put out to staff, which...

551
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:57,672
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't even directed towards staff it was directed towards shareholders which is just some bullshit right there which they made but I'm not even gonna read it because it's just just just imagine PR speak about how we need to make these cuts but also we're super you know we're doing really well we're doing so well this is the best time ever but we also have to make these cuts

552
00:44:57,652 --> 00:44:59,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of reasons, of course.

553
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:02,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just, you know, how shareholders work.

554
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:08,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a lot of cuts that was done at King, of course.

555
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:11,969
[SPEAKER_07]: They lost 200 employees, or roughly 10% of their workforce.

556
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:20,919
[SPEAKER_07]: They have closed down, cut off a lot of different studios as well, cancelled many projects.

557
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,102
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about some of those cancellations.

558
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:26,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect Dark reboot not coming out anymore.

559
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:38,728
[SPEAKER_07]: That has been cancelled and they've also not only have they cancelled Perfect Dark but also the other rare project Everwild which has been in production for well

560
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:41,290
[SPEAKER_07]: A very long time, over 10 years at this point.

561
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:45,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is also disappointing.

562
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:52,520
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some cuts at the Elder Scrolls Online Studios as well, at Bethesda Online, ZeniMax Online, that's right.

563
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a new looter shooter game that they said was Blade Runner meets Destiny 2.

564
00:45:59,086 --> 00:46:00,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds just like Destiny 2.

565
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:05,331
[SPEAKER_07]: That also got cancelled as well.

566
00:46:06,192 --> 00:46:09,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I mean, I wonder if it's because of some of this, you know,

567
00:46:09,235 --> 00:46:29,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.

568
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:31,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that.

569
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:31,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

570
00:46:31,814 --> 00:46:32,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard there was some game.

571
00:46:32,975 --> 00:46:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Zenimax was working on it.

572
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:35,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

573
00:46:35,178 --> 00:46:37,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something that he liked.

574
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically said that it was a good game or something like that.

575
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:41,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

576
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:42,087
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why he canceled.

577
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:43,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's because it was a good game.

578
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you remember the old Iwata quote, a bad game is bad forever.

579
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: A good game is good forever.

580
00:46:49,076 --> 00:46:50,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Phil Spencer kills it.

581
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:52,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's how the Iwata Club went, right?

582
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:58,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know what games could possibly never be good, of course, would be a new John Romero game.

583
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:00,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, let's kill that as well.

584
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:04,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's another Romero game studio game that is not coming out.

585
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, they made a

586
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:09,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Statement about that as well.

587
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:20,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it was they said they were working on new FPS in Unreal 5 and three years later it was cancelled.

588
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:21,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been in development for at least three years.

589
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

590
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:24,648
[SPEAKER_07]: What else?

591
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:33,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that this is all very shocking and you're probably thinking like god damn what the hell are they thinking?

592
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:37,343
[SPEAKER_07]: What are those C-suite people thinking?

593
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,255
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell are they doing?

594
00:47:39,796 --> 00:47:46,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Phil Spencer wants you to know that despite the fact there's been all these massive layoffs, don't worry.

595
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:48,416
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going anywhere.

596
00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:49,839
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not retiring anytime soon.

597
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So he'll be helping more of this bullshit for the near future as well.

598
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:55,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank God for that.

599
00:47:55,632 --> 00:48:16,763
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

600
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:33,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't continue to defend the man after this and I truly really believe that if he is making losses this big, if the impact on the workforce is this large and this many projects are going, that is a lack of leadership and he should have been one of the ones that left.

601
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:35,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.

602
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Full stop.

603
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:46,341
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is a sign of misdirection, or these are games that should not have been made, he should be one to take the fall as well.

604
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:47,302
[SPEAKER_03]: He should be dismissed.

605
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:50,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to say, but not sorry to say.

606
00:48:50,966 --> 00:48:51,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.

607
00:48:51,766 --> 00:49:03,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was doing... I'm sitting here going... The parts that make no sense here, I thought Microsoft was in a place, Xbox, that was better than ever...

608
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:14,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Pass is doing Gangbusters recently with a lot of the games that are on it right now even King I'm surprised that there was layoffs there because Candy Crush is doing Gangbusters as well so like

609
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:22,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that there are some redundancies post-mergers, but they already did that.

610
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: They already did that.

611
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:24,439
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already claimed that one before.

612
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what are we talking about?

613
00:49:26,782 --> 00:49:28,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are like canceled projects.

614
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:36,576
[SPEAKER_03]: These are games that apparently were fun that they don't want to put out at all for whatever, you know, whether it's market conditions.

615
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:40,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't fucking know why if a game is really fun, you don't put it out.

616
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:45,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was an investment they didn't feel they needed to take, I guess.

617
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:50,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

618
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:56,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I'm disappointed, obviously, with all that.

619
00:49:58,297 --> 00:50:01,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's another fun one that I saw as well.

620
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:07,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Forza Motorsport is no more, following the cuts.

621
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That blew my mind, too.

622
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are all those people at Take-10 getting laid off?

623
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:17,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Forza Horizon is the reason to be an Xbox gamer.

624
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:20,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the best exclusive franchises they have.

625
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:28,742
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on the Fable game, which I realize it's taken a long time to cook, and maybe that's the problem with a lot of these.

626
00:50:28,722 --> 00:50:36,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, keep in mind, folks, there is a difference between Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon.

627
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Forza Motorsport was kind of that mainline Forza series that I think was up to seven games.

628
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:43,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Was seven the most recent release?

629
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:48,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think what happened, Horizon... Or it was just Forza Motorsport.

630
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:49,650
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't even have like a...

631
00:50:50,305 --> 00:50:53,329
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened along the way is that Horizon eclipsed it.

632
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:54,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real.

633
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Horizon is the more... Because it's the more palpable one.

634
00:50:59,797 --> 00:51:02,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one that you can pick up and run with.

635
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:08,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one with all of the accessibility features where all you have to do is fucking accelerate if that's what you need to do for the game.

636
00:51:08,948 --> 00:51:13,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, that's... Horizon is just the bigger franchise at this point.

637
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:16,338
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm still shocked... Right, and that's the big clarify with that, too.

638
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:19,722
[SPEAKER_07]: That the studios still open to support the Horizon side, but...

639
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:23,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jvmon in chat says Horizon is more casual friendly.

640
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:24,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It can take on the Mario Karts of the world.

641
00:51:24,888 --> 00:51:25,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.

642
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:31,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would agree that Forza Motorsport, I mean, there's an audience for it, but the bang probably wasn't worth the buck there.

643
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: But laying off that entire team, why wouldn't you shift a really good chunk of those resources into pumping more into Horizon?

644
00:51:40,728 --> 00:51:48,697
[SPEAKER_03]: or putting out Horizon games more frequently or making them more robust or putting a little bit of that professionalism into Horizon.

645
00:51:48,818 --> 00:51:50,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you not do that?

646
00:51:53,223 --> 00:52:05,858
[SPEAKER_07]: So on top of all that, so they also canceled or they've laid off a lot of different developers also working on Call of Duty because God forbid there's like there's I don't even know how many studios are working on Call of Duty.

647
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,460
[SPEAKER_07]: So they did lay off a lot there.

648
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's across the entire

649
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:36,469
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, games division as is and I think a lot of it has to do with the focus on Microsoft not necessarily Xbox, but Microsoft spending I think they're going to be spending 80 billion dollars on AI development over the course of this entire year which now brings us to the other fuck you that's part of this as well so after all these people were laid off they got an email um

650
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: for people that are going to Gamescom.

651
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:42,183
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, we're excited to be heading to Gamescom 2025.

652
00:52:42,603 --> 00:52:45,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, we'll be contending.

653
00:52:45,047 --> 00:52:55,942
[SPEAKER_07]: We're offering an AI roundtable where you can provide us feedback on how you'd like to see us use AI tools and processes to make game development and publishing experience more efficient.

654
00:52:57,024 --> 00:52:59,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the...

655
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:04,967
[SPEAKER_07]: The icing on the cake, or the shit cake that it is with the layoffs and stuff.

656
00:53:05,027 --> 00:53:07,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you're pushing all this generative AI stuff.

657
00:53:08,153 --> 00:53:16,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody wants it, but you're going all in on it because you're trying to be the next Google of this tech space that is brand new.

658
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:25,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... This AI thing drives me bonkers because these companies are about to learn the hard way.

659
00:53:25,548 --> 00:53:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: You get what you pay for with this AI stuff.

660
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:33,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... AI can make your current employees better.

661
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't replace your current employees.

662
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lesson that these companies are going to learn in an explosively negative way, which unfortunately, good.

663
00:53:44,379 --> 00:53:46,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to learn the lesson in a negative way.

664
00:53:48,966 --> 00:53:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: People that have been advocating for this on the inside, the CEOs, the board, the upper managers, need to be held accountable when this all goes to shit.

665
00:53:56,918 --> 00:53:57,539
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't be.

666
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:58,380
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.

667
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:17,466
[SPEAKER_07]: it's because they're they're making money for their shareholders and unfortunately the lesson won't be learned by them it'll be learned by employees that they lay off and then oh hey this this was absolute dog shit let's close this studio now because we used AI tools and no one's ever going to learn the lesson it's just going to be

668
00:54:17,446 --> 00:54:31,810
[SPEAKER_07]: As consumers, you just have to be vigilant and, once again, not pre-ordering your games so that you can be aware of what AI nonsense is being put into your games because they certainly like to seem to slip it in without anybody knowing.

669
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:42,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is so weird because, you know, when you think that AI is so good and everybody loves it that, you know, you'd be proud to announce that, like, AI is in shit because, God forbid, like, all the...

670
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:52,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Appliance manufacturers and everything else I don't want AI in are so proud to announce that AI is part of my refrigerator or some bullshit like that.

671
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,504
[SPEAKER_07]: They're purposely hiding it because it's sloppy.

672
00:54:55,524 --> 00:55:03,433
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cheap bullshit that they're trying to pass off as actual artistic work.

673
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:04,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just going to be slop.

674
00:55:04,775 --> 00:55:05,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get slop.

675
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:06,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Slop in, slop out.

676
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:09,340
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be good.

677
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:24,730
[SPEAKER_07]: but just they have to learn that lesson and well like I said unfortunately it's not them learning the lesson the C-suite people no one's going to hold them to account it's going to be you know maybe the shareholders will if they don't make as much money but I mean they'll fire more people I guess

678
00:55:25,874 --> 00:55:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the world we live in.

679
00:55:44,555 --> 00:55:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: That talks about a LinkedIn, which I believe is another Microsoft property, by the way.

680
00:55:49,683 --> 00:56:01,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So Matt Turnbull, who is an executive producer at Xbox Game Studios, made a post on LinkedIn basically saying, These are really challenging times, and if you're navigating a layoff or quietly preparing for one, you're not alone and don't have to go it alone.

681
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:09,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been experimenting with ways to use LLM AI tools to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss.

682
00:56:09,412 --> 00:56:13,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could do career planning prompts, resume and LinkedIn help.

683
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:15,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, here's my current resume.

684
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:16,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me three tailored versions.

685
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Networking and outreach, emotional clarity and confidence.

686
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm struggling with imposter syndrome after being laid off.

687
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:25,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you help me reframe this experience in a way that reminds me what I'm good at?

688
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, here's the kicker, Loki.

689
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:33,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Then at the end of his LinkedIn post, he says, no AI tool is a replacement for your voice or your lived experience.

690
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:44,679
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is the only context I feel out of all of this and all of everything that we've talked about so far to which the proper response is to eat my entire ass.

691
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, can we just talk about LinkedIn in general?

692
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,032
[SPEAKER_07]: LinkedIn is a bunch of bullshit.

693
00:56:54,072 --> 00:56:58,078
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember my company wanted me to set up a LinkedIn page for God knows what reason.

694
00:56:58,098 --> 00:56:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted something.

695
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,562
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, you have to be on here.

696
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:01,583
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so important.

697
00:57:01,984 --> 00:57:03,185
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll network.

698
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:04,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I...

699
00:57:04,407 --> 00:57:33,385
[SPEAKER_03]: so it is such a useless piece of shit if you just want to see people gassing themselves up that they're the smartest people on the fucking planet look no further than LinkedIn oh my god now look I there's things I like about LinkedIn my last two jobs I have found through LinkedIn so I will say something nice about LinkedIn I mean that that's that's the job search side of the the coin if you look at the social feed and the things that people post on there Jesus Christ

700
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:50,007
[SPEAKER_07]: it's unreal but it's real but it's unreal anyway and not unreal because that's that's a game engine that's right that's a game engine that's way better than LinkedIn

701
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:57,586
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, that's okay, because LinkedIn, you're going to find lots of AI there, lots of prompts and stuff.

702
00:57:57,626 --> 00:58:06,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure that there's probably a course on how to just have generative AI just post a bunch of bullshit to your page, and you'll become super popular then.

703
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll make it as a CEO eventually, I'm sure.

704
00:58:09,391 --> 00:58:09,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

705
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:29,916
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that have a have co-pilot replace Phil Spencer then if AI is so fucking good have it run your have it make your decisions at your company then if it's so well no no no we we can't be replaced we are too too smart for that yeah it's just it's dumb

706
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:30,992
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

707
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:48,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if there is some good news to be had on the Xbox front this week, Helldivers 2, which was a big hit on the PlayStation 5, is coming to Xbox and all the Microsoft platforms this August because the exclusive window has basically is closing.

708
00:58:48,771 --> 00:58:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the Sony published Helldivers 2 will no longer be exclusive as of August.

709
00:58:54,837 --> 00:58:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, Arrowhead Game Studios, Johan

710
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:02,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I said that right.

711
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:07,328
[SPEAKER_03]: The chief creative officer said during a live stream, you've asked for more dudes.

712
00:59:07,368 --> 00:59:08,490
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sending more dudes.

713
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,776
[SPEAKER_03]: For one and a half years, you've been fighting the enemies of democracy.

714
00:59:11,796 --> 00:59:15,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the requests that you've always had is for us to send more dudes.

715
00:59:15,142 --> 00:59:19,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best way for us to be able to do that is to bring another platform into the fight.

716
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:23,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So Xbox Series X and S will get the game August 26, $40.

717
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:24,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's good.

718
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:26,328
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not trying to charge $70 for it.

719
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:28,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was always a lower price.

720
00:59:28,935 --> 00:59:29,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always been $40.

721
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:33,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is probably another reason why it's doing so well.

722
00:59:33,734 --> 01:00:01,547
[SPEAKER_03]: so there you go 18 months after launch uh more content to catch up on so good luck to the Xbox players um I don't know if there's a lot of people that are gonna be jumping in but I don't I mean it is a really good game I've heard nothing but really good things about it so I'm sure um I'm sure it's a good time so for those that are kind of confined to their gaming on Xbox now you have a chance to join in so good luck all right Loki what do you have uh talk about like

723
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:06,272
[SPEAKER_07]: The wrong timeline, but okay, let's talk about how...

724
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:13,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know, you're playing Fortnite and stuff, and you're like, wow, I really want those skins, but they're just ridiculously expensive.

725
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:14,499
[SPEAKER_07]: They're charging $50.

726
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should finance this, said nobody ever.

727
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:21,948
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what they're planning on doing.

728
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:33,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, a payment provider, Affirm, has said they partnered with Xsolla to allow people to pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more via payment plans.

729
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes without saying, and I shouldn't have to tell anybody, and I'm sure everybody is an adult here and understands, there is no reason whatsoever that you should purchase an in-game purchase on a payment plan.

730
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:51,845
[SPEAKER_07]: It is clearly a scam.

731
01:00:51,965 --> 01:01:01,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It is clearly predatory in the sense that they're trying to get pre-owned people that have no financial responsibility.

732
01:01:02,108 --> 01:01:28,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they just, you know, impulsively buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy And then they won't be able to make their payments They charge them the late fees, so on and so forth And it's only going to get worse, Loki With everything going on in the world You have a pair of eyes and ears You see what's going on in the news And you know that there's people that are going to be losing a lot And this type of predatory shit is only going to get worse I really need people And again, I think you are right I think most of the people...

733
01:01:28,923 --> 01:01:52,720
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

734
01:01:52,700 --> 01:02:00,702
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think y'all know better than you don't need a fucking $40 skin in Fortnite you don't need the Ariana Grande skin that bad to finance it

735
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:27,448
[SPEAKER_03]: because the amount that you end up paying but this goes to things like and this is the reality of the world and there's there are a lot of people out there that are financing DoorDash meals because there's so much in advertising and things like that that encourage it and I am so worried that this shit is only going to get worse and these types of companies are only going to get more predatory because when somebody is fucking hungry and it's push at tap

736
01:02:27,428 --> 01:02:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

737
01:02:51,138 --> 01:03:01,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really frightened to see what it does to people.

738
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:06,111
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have a chat button that says click to taco a representative.

739
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:08,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.

740
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:09,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

741
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,581
[SPEAKER_03]: We're leaving.

742
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:17,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just don't participate with this at all, I would say.

743
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:25,641
[SPEAKER_07]: In-game purchases shouldn't be that expensive in the first place, like any of this stuff.

744
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:26,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't know.

745
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:28,786
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

746
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:36,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you push the button to finance these skins, why don't you work on hacking the server to get them for free?

747
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:42,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I should be noted that it's not necessarily in Fortnite.

748
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Xsolla has partnered with Epic Games.

749
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:49,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So Xsolla, I think, is the payment processor, but they also offer these services separately.

750
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:52,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means the Epic Games store will be part of this as well.

751
01:03:53,905 --> 01:03:55,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not tied into that.

752
01:03:55,888 --> 01:03:58,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I don't know.

753
01:03:58,112 --> 01:04:00,295
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't be financing...

754
01:04:00,494 --> 01:04:02,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait.

755
01:04:02,698 --> 01:04:09,911
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're looking to finance a brand new game or something like that, just wait for it to go on sale.

756
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:12,315
[SPEAKER_07]: You can wait to do it.

757
01:04:12,335 --> 01:04:16,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, with the DoorDash stuff, assuming that you're able to do it,

758
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: like and and you're you're you'll have the mobility to be able to leave your house and do all that stuff it's a lot cheaper just to go pick it up yourself like i get it it's the convenience but they're charging you a fee on top of a fee on charge on top of raising the prices on all the items like it's just just do it yourself

759
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:40,990
[SPEAKER_03]: and then put the $10 that would have cost you a DoorDash in some type of account that has dividends.

760
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know I'm talking like a, you know, but like the reality is, people, you got to save whatever you can, especially in these times, you know, and I know it's hard, but it's just, it's crazy out there.

761
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:59,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Rimari in chat says, I have a friend who's disabled.

762
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:00,891
[SPEAKER_03]: He's dependent on delivery apps to get food.

763
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:01,552
[SPEAKER_03]: That's different.

764
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:02,514
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very different.

765
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:06,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's completely different and completely understandable.

766
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:12,987
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would also wonder what type of social and public services, well, used to be available a year ago, I guess.

767
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:15,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Who fucking knows now in 2025?

768
01:05:16,652 --> 01:05:20,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they may have some friends willing to help out once in a while or something.

769
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:24,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully there are some other options to mix in with that, but that is a completely different scenario.

770
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:24,703
Yeah.

771
01:05:24,802 --> 01:05:31,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and with that, I would say also, too, like sometimes it may not be like, say you want to get pizza delivered or something like that.

772
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:34,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go through DoorDash to get that pizza delivered.

773
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:36,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Go through the actual pizza company's website.

774
01:05:36,861 --> 01:05:38,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them you don't have a choice anymore.

775
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them you don't have a choice.

776
01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:42,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them they just use that as their delivery option.

777
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:46,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's, I mean, obviously that's going to be your only option.

778
01:05:46,993 --> 01:05:49,516
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of them don't do that.

779
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:51,118
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them have their own drivers.

780
01:05:51,399 --> 01:05:55,063
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you pay that way, it's going to be significantly cheaper than it.

781
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:57,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to do your research, I guess.

782
01:05:57,346 --> 01:06:00,850
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do your due diligence to make sure that you're not getting ripped off.

783
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so chat understands, I'm not saying never use DoorDash.

784
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:06,028
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a luxury.

785
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:10,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I DoorDash food today, so I'll be like... Treat it like a luxury.

786
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.

787
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:13,520
[SPEAKER_03]: But recognize what you're really paying for that.

788
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Recognize that, okay, I'm spending $20 to...

789
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:34,971
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

790
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting.

791
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a whole other conversation.

792
01:06:37,314 --> 01:06:41,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking about this the other day because we were – I went out for Indian food with some friends.

793
01:06:42,441 --> 01:06:44,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, some friends that play Ingress.

794
01:06:44,123 --> 01:06:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all some video gaming stuff.

795
01:06:46,326 --> 01:06:52,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I went out and met some friends for Indian food and we were kind of mentioning like, oh, the Indian food place, we see so many DoorDash people.

796
01:06:52,615 --> 01:06:57,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were the only people in the restaurant but we saw so many DoorDash and those people going in and out, right?

797
01:06:57,762 --> 01:06:59,524
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's that whole like –

798
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:05,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you have restaurants like Red Lobster, TGI Fridays, they're all going under.

799
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:09,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like, why?

800
01:07:09,213 --> 01:07:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, people, I think people are failing to see the reason is people are door dashing better food now.

801
01:07:14,237 --> 01:07:29,511
[SPEAKER_03]: They're door dashing more local, smaller cuisines, like Chinese food, Mexican food, Indian food, you name it, your favorite, you know, more mom and pop smaller store cuisine that like, who sits there and goes, I'm going to door dash TGI Fridays.

802
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want TGI Friday's mozzarella stick, they sell them in a bag in the freezer section at the store.

803
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:37,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why those types of places are going under because nobody really craves the food.

804
01:07:37,598 --> 01:07:39,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooters, that's another great example.

805
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:42,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Who door dashed Hooters?

806
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:45,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody ever door dash Hooters?

807
01:07:45,025 --> 01:07:45,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it was a meme?

808
01:07:45,986 --> 01:07:46,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it on DoorDash.

809
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:48,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then that's a meme.

810
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:49,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fucking meme.

811
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it on DoorDash.

812
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:57,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never eat their food because I've had their food many times and I don't like it.

813
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:58,958
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's...

814
01:07:59,748 --> 01:08:00,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know.

815
01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:03,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I don't know why I got on that tangent.

816
01:08:03,785 --> 01:08:08,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in Rancho, and now it's a better chicken place.

817
01:08:09,097 --> 01:08:12,000
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma says, Rob, I would if I had one nearby.

818
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they had a different place.

819
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:24,593
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a place called Twin Peaks, which sadly has nothing to do with the David Lynchian masterpiece and everything to do with Twin Peaks on a lady's chest, right?

820
01:08:24,613 --> 01:08:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that sort of thing.

821
01:08:26,796 --> 01:08:28,938
[SPEAKER_03]: That restaurant is gone now, too.

822
01:08:29,599 --> 01:08:37,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I found out recently that we have a local bikini coffee shop

823
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:41,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Over Here By, like in Carmichael.

824
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:42,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

825
01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:51,282
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right next to a place, a Japanese sushi restaurant that my wife goes to all the time.

826
01:08:51,783 --> 01:09:02,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know we were leaving there one day, I'm like, wait, that looks like one of those bikini restaurant things, or like, because the name, it's like, you know, a double entendre name, you know, something like that.

827
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:04,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Baristas in bikinis, that type of thing.

828
01:09:04,955 --> 01:09:06,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

829
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:11,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess we have the weather here to support something like that.

830
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:12,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So work, I guess.

831
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

832
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:15,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on.

833
01:09:15,491 --> 01:09:17,114
[SPEAKER_03]: We're way on a tangent.

834
01:09:17,134 --> 01:09:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: But what else do you expect here at Orange Launch Radio?

835
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about Amazon and Nintendo.

836
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:32,158
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably noticed you were not able to get a Switch 2 through Amazon, and it was a pretty glaring omission of the different retailers that you could pick up a Switch from.

837
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:38,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bloomberg has run a report this week that has talked about the recent issues between the two companies.

838
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:48,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Nintendo of America was not happy that third-party sellers on Amazon were selling video games for lower prices than what Nintendo had advertised.

839
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they would do, they would buy the games in bulk from Southeast Asia, export them to the United States, and then turn them around cheaper than the recommended retail price.

840
01:09:58,456 --> 01:09:58,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly?

841
01:09:58,957 --> 01:09:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

842
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:01,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart Strategy, I guess, right?

843
01:10:01,824 --> 01:10:04,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But Amazon did not stop this from happening.

844
01:10:04,691 --> 01:10:07,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo said, fuck you, Amazon.

845
01:10:07,558 --> 01:10:10,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paraphrasing, but essentially that's what happened.

846
01:10:11,693 --> 01:10:16,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Both companies are denying what Bloomberg has said, by the way, which I think is interesting as well.

847
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:27,015
[SPEAKER_03]: In a quote here, Amazon tried to assuage Nintendo by offering to attach labels to products that guarantee they're authentic.

848
01:10:27,035 --> 01:10:33,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon uses the technique to assure shoppers products aren't counterfeits and to help track merchandise.

849
01:10:33,023 --> 01:10:40,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But the offer wasn't sufficient, the person said, and Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the U.S.

850
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,823
[SPEAKER_03]: My how times have changed.

851
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:44,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about an Amazon seal of quality.

852
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:47,075
[SPEAKER_03]: on a Nintendo product.

853
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:48,637
[SPEAKER_07]: How times have changed.

854
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:52,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just pause for a second and understand the irony of that.

855
01:10:52,524 --> 01:10:56,271
[SPEAKER_07]: The Amazon seal of quality on a Nintendo product.

856
01:10:56,351 --> 01:11:00,478
[SPEAKER_07]: With all the Chinese knockoff fake stuff that's in their marketplace.

857
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay.

858
01:11:03,023 --> 01:11:08,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Amazon Basic where they rip off other people by stealing their designs and stuff.

859
01:11:08,673 --> 01:11:09,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

860
01:11:09,174 --> 01:11:09,274
Yeah.

861
01:11:10,823 --> 01:11:30,064
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX Game Pass

862
01:11:30,044 --> 01:11:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

863
01:11:49,163 --> 01:12:13,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass

864
01:12:13,143 --> 01:12:14,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently.

865
01:12:14,646 --> 01:12:15,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

866
01:12:16,129 --> 01:12:21,881
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, then they added five games that did nothing to advertise or bring eyesight to that.

867
01:12:22,242 --> 01:12:24,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I posted on Blue Sky about that.

868
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:25,889
[SPEAKER_03]: The AntStream account, nothing.

869
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:28,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox account, nothing.

870
01:12:28,274 --> 01:12:32,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hello, do you want these products to succeed or no?

871
01:12:33,505 --> 01:12:33,565
No.

872
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,219
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

873
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:35,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

874
01:12:37,522 --> 01:12:46,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it could be interesting to see what the effect is that this has on Game Pass because now there's not going to be an Everwild, there's not going to be a Perfect Dark, there's not going to be an MMO from Zenimax.

875
01:12:47,855 --> 01:12:51,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting to see what happens with that.

876
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:52,040
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

877
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of things that layoffs have unfortunately impacted, Loki.

878
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, let's talk about another game that's getting cancelled as well.

879
01:13:00,526 --> 01:13:03,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Outriders 2.

880
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:07,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it was cancelled over issues with Square Enix.

881
01:13:11,363 --> 01:13:17,693
[SPEAKER_07]: People Can Fly was working on a game called Codename Gemini, which has of course now been suspended.

882
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:22,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And they reported that the sequel was nearly finished.

883
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:28,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Before Square Enix decided to... I don't know what they're disputing over.

884
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:32,549
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, yeah, it's not coming out.

885
01:13:32,569 --> 01:13:34,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So sorry, no Outriders 2.

886
01:13:36,758 --> 01:13:37,459
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unfortunate.

887
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:40,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, um...

888
01:13:40,437 --> 01:13:42,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I know maybe because the first game didn't do as well.

889
01:13:43,021 --> 01:13:46,005
[SPEAKER_07]: It says it didn't turn a profit within its first year.

890
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there were quite a few people playing that game at first.

891
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:51,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it didn't sustain itself or something.

892
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:53,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, DJ Ranma S says Outriders was a fun game.

893
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:55,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a third person Borderlands.

894
01:13:55,277 --> 01:13:56,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I even played Outriders in the beginning.

895
01:13:56,959 --> 01:13:59,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on Game Pass, so it was easy to, you know, kind of get into.

896
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:01,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a bummer.

897
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:03,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

898
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:04,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucks.

899
01:14:04,805 --> 01:14:25,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthem will officially shut down January 12, 2026

900
01:14:25,105 --> 01:14:30,933
[SPEAKER_03]: EA has made it very clear, once the servers go offline, the game will no longer be playable.

901
01:14:30,953 --> 01:14:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthem is being delisted from EA Play as of August 15th, 2025.

902
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:44,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe none of the money in-game can be spent, like you can't buy stuff for money in-game and all that stuff anymore.

903
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:48,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's on its way out, which probably isn't surprising.

904
01:14:48,858 --> 01:14:50,320
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, there are...

905
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:54,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a handful of people that are playing that, I'm sure, that are devastated by this news.

906
01:14:54,625 --> 01:15:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't mean to like shit on the fans of this game, but this is exactly to bring it full circle why people want to be able to run their own Anthem servers then, or, you know, pay to have, you know, something going on in the cloud or something like that.

907
01:15:06,718 --> 01:15:08,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon in chat says, Anthem was still around?

908
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it closed down like two years ago.

909
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:11,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did too.

910
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:16,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But just because it's, you know, somebody out there still playing it, obviously.

911
01:15:16,508 --> 01:15:18,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is, it is...

912
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad in that regard to see it go, but to me, Anthem is a symbol of every bad decision that Bioware has made under EA's control in the last few years, so I'm not exactly sorry to see it go, but that doesn't mean that people shouldn't still be able to play it if they don't want to.

913
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:40,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

914
01:15:40,298 --> 01:15:47,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster says that content support ended, but they still kept the game alive, and says it was fun being a magic-wielding Iron Man.

915
01:15:48,063 --> 01:15:49,906
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

916
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:58,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we already did our classic game of the week, we're going to skip on ahead to rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines going on a little quickly here.

917
01:15:58,881 --> 01:15:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll go to you.

918
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:01,165
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

919
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:09,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So Hades 2, they've got... Basically, it's last patch before launch.

920
01:16:11,021 --> 01:16:12,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

921
01:16:12,717 --> 01:16:18,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I guess they're talking about coming out early access because I was like reading that.

922
01:16:18,744 --> 01:16:20,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been in early access for a while now.

923
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's been in early access for a while.

924
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:24,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like before how patch before launch.

925
01:16:26,074 --> 01:16:35,265
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so basically it's getting its last major update before I guess going to be version 1.0 at some point.

926
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:36,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that's cool.

927
01:16:37,349 --> 01:16:40,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see how it turns out, I guess.

928
01:16:40,755 --> 01:16:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

929
01:16:41,056 --> 01:16:42,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played Hades or Hades 2.

930
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:43,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're missing out.

931
01:16:43,821 --> 01:16:44,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some good games.

932
01:16:44,582 --> 01:16:46,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Hades is good.

933
01:16:46,466 --> 01:16:50,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of Hades 2, but I'm kind of waiting for the library.

934
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:53,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of waiting for Hades 2 to be done before I jump back in.

935
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:55,262
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was I really enjoyed what I played.

936
01:16:56,137 --> 01:16:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

937
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:02,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, SNK has delisted a bunch of games from its Google Play Store.

938
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget that they have games on the Google Play Store because I don't really think about playing Metal Slug on my phone, but apparently they've delisted their ports of Blazing Star, Metal Slug, Metal Slug 2, Metal Slug X, Fail Fury Special, Garou Mark of the Wolves, King of Fighters 97, King of Fighters 98, and Samurai Shodown 2.

939
01:17:25,448 --> 01:17:33,417
[SPEAKER_07]: um yeah so that sucks but I mean I'm guessing they've been on there for a long time

940
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:36,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

941
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on to talking about what's coming out for Arcade Archives Series 2.

942
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:49,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a game, I must admit, I'm not super familiar with this game, but some of you out there probably know it.

943
01:17:49,658 --> 01:17:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Dimension Fortress Macross 2.

944
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:58,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly know Macross, but I don't remember this particular arcade game, but this is probably something that Jamie played.

945
01:17:58,871 --> 01:17:59,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a schmucks.

946
01:17:59,492 --> 01:18:00,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Dimension Fortress.

947
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:01,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's Macross.

948
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:02,796
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's,

949
01:18:02,776 --> 01:18:04,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I just never played this game.

950
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:05,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Macross is the full name.

951
01:18:06,144 --> 01:18:07,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, interesting.

952
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:10,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess probably some of you in chat play this.

953
01:18:10,815 --> 01:18:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely looks a lot like kind of Gradius with the power-ups and stuff, but it looks pretty cool.

954
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:20,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'd check this out.

955
01:18:20,157 --> 01:18:23,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen... We're going to go on the tangent train now.

956
01:18:23,903 --> 01:18:30,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen that... It's not new, but it's an emulator that's for the NES.

957
01:18:30,674 --> 01:18:35,322
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the old 3DS NES games.

958
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:37,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember how they had the 3D 3DS games?

959
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

960
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:39,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we come back to that?

961
01:18:39,108 --> 01:19:05,335
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

962
01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which allows the emulation of, I guess, some stronger systems because it's only available on certain platforms.

963
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is that.

964
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:21,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, one other headline, and we already kind of referenced this earlier in the show, and that is the fact that, um...

965
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:23,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer Games Done Quick is underway.

966
01:19:23,953 --> 01:19:35,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer Games Done Quick 2025 Raising Money for Doctors Without Borders running starting today on July 6th and running through the rest of the week through the 13th.

967
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:51,572
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

968
01:19:51,552 --> 01:19:52,914
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, check it out.

969
01:19:53,014 --> 01:19:54,797
[SPEAKER_03]: They're raising money for charity.

970
01:19:54,897 --> 01:20:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Network's own Bobby Blackwolf will be there on Thursday and Saturday, helping out with reading some donations and all that stuff.

971
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:06,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But just remember, you can't do any type of shout-out for VOG, Bobby, OLR.

972
01:20:06,494 --> 01:20:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: They will not get read.

973
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:10,379
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not about people's egos.

974
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:11,882
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about the speedrunners.

975
01:20:11,902 --> 01:20:13,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It is about the charity.

976
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:14,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the event.

977
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:19,112
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep your comments on your donations about those sorts of things would be my advice because...

978
01:20:19,092 --> 01:20:26,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I tried to send in a donation once that was from Mr. Smush and they didn't read it because they thought it was some type of R-rated joke.

979
01:20:26,899 --> 01:20:28,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't even make its way to Bobby's desk.

980
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The screeners cut it out beforehand.

981
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Which makes, I mean, in retrospect, makes sense.

982
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:40,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you don't know that Mr. Smush is my cat, you're not going to know what the hell that is and so you're going to throw it out because you don't want something coded to make it out on stream.

983
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So be very careful what you write with those donations.

984
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:43,455
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

985
01:20:43,595 --> 01:20:44,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just donate.

986
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:46,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Just donate.

987
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:48,340
[SPEAKER_03]: In chat...

988
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:53,129
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says it's actually Arcade Archives 1 is Macross.

989
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:57,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Archives 2 got Air Combat 22 this week, if I recall correctly.

990
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go back to what you were talking about, Loki, when we were doing Rapid Fire News, because we have some time anyway here.

991
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:06,514
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a little extra time with Jamie cutting out early.

992
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:07,476
Sure.

993
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing I played this week.

994
01:21:10,034 --> 01:21:17,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's this big trend online lately of Nintendo games getting ported to Super Nintendo.

995
01:21:17,786 --> 01:21:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a story on this last week, the week before.

996
01:21:21,412 --> 01:21:27,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Life Force, or Salamander, but Life Force here in the US was one of these games that was recently ported.

997
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:31,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might go, well, why do they put the NES game on the Super Nintendo?

998
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:32,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they don't change the graphics.

999
01:21:33,169 --> 01:21:34,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it's completely different.

1000
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:35,573
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do that.

1001
01:21:35,553 --> 01:21:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: They do that so that it helps to reduce flicker, slow down, and sometimes they can add different types of music types of stuff to it.

1002
01:21:47,446 --> 01:21:56,135
[SPEAKER_03]: One game that I actually played this week is I actually played a Kid Icarus port of Kid Icarus ported to the Super Nintendo.

1003
01:21:57,237 --> 01:22:04,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of what the Super Nintendo port does is it brings in the backgrounds from the 3DS version.

1004
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: which is very interesting although I gotta be honest I didn't find that it really like ran any better to me but look I found this random YouTube video and I'm going to bring this up for folks that are watching live but you can see what this looks like it kind of adds a lot to it it really is just the NES version of Kid Icarus but it's using the backgrounds from the 3DS version of the game and you'll notice they they scroll at kind of a different rate you know um

1005
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:59,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about...

1006
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:02,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember how they had the 3D Excite bike and stuff like that?

1007
01:23:02,395 --> 01:23:08,307
[SPEAKER_07]: How it was actually three-dimensional with the particular display?

1008
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:14,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have an actual emulator that is on Steam.

1009
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:15,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that.

1010
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:18,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to remember what it's called.

1011
01:23:19,469 --> 01:23:19,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1012
01:23:21,275 --> 01:23:26,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a 3D emulator that 3D-ifies games.

1013
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:32,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if people have to add a configuration, but it supports a lot of games already.

1014
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:36,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But it makes everything look voxel-y, I guess.

1015
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:40,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it... Okay, I'm looking at a YouTube, but this is dated three years ago, so maybe it's not this.

1016
01:23:40,995 --> 01:23:41,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it this?

1017
01:23:42,396 --> 01:23:43,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it this, Loki?

1018
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1019
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:48,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It is... That's...

1020
01:23:48,882 --> 01:23:50,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I like this.

1021
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:50,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be.

1022
01:23:50,945 --> 01:23:52,107
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks kind of funky to me.

1023
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it could be.

1024
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can adjust the camera and everything on it because it's fully 3D.

1025
01:23:56,914 --> 01:23:57,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I like that, though.

1026
01:23:57,956 --> 01:23:59,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That just seems... But, okay.

1027
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:03,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's called 3D Sen, is what it's called.

1028
01:24:04,246 --> 01:24:07,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a paid emulator on PC.

1029
01:24:07,551 --> 01:24:08,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, 3D Sen.

1030
01:24:09,494 --> 01:24:11,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Also supports VR and stuff.

1031
01:24:11,397 --> 01:24:12,679
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, it looked pretty cool.

1032
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:13,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, interesting.

1033
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I was curious to see what Pixel Poop's number two would look like in that.

1034
01:24:17,905 --> 01:24:18,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1035
01:24:18,926 --> 01:24:21,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably pretty terrible because I don't think it's set up.

1036
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,231
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean pretty poopy?

1037
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:25,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It would look pretty poopy, yeah.

1038
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,897
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't even know if it would run in that.

1039
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:29,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to check and see.

1040
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:33,363
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the demos that they were showing look pretty cool.

1041
01:24:33,803 --> 01:24:41,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know I have this fancy new video card, and if nothing else, I can run 3D emulators on it, so let's go, right?

1042
01:24:41,592 --> 01:24:42,193
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1043
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1044
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:50,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check out some games that are coming out, you know, 3D emulated or not.

1045
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:52,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously not, because these are all new games.

1046
01:24:53,312 --> 01:24:59,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should support games when they come out and not pirate them, because that's why we have layoffs.

1047
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:03,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, starting in the US, what do you have coming out?

1048
01:25:03,184 --> 01:25:07,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had to check to make sure this wasn't a typo, but Backyard Baseball 01.

1049
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,993
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, from 2001.

1050
01:25:10,013 --> 01:25:11,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

1051
01:25:11,587 --> 01:25:16,783
[SPEAKER_07]: PC, iOS, and Android I don't know why that's being ported.

1052
01:25:17,264 --> 01:25:18,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It is so old.

[SPEAKER_03]: Going to Japan.

1059
01:26:29,302 --> 01:26:33,329
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Switch 2 this week in Japan, Split Fiction gets its Japanese release.

1060
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Please recognize that it's just a code in a box.

1061
01:26:36,635 --> 01:26:38,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's those types of releases.

1062
01:26:38,077 --> 01:26:38,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Code in a box.

1063
01:26:38,899 --> 01:26:39,700
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1064
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:44,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Those releases have been somewhat controversial, but that is what they're putting on the shelves this week.

1065
01:26:44,028 --> 01:26:48,835
[SPEAKER_03]: On the original Switch, though, there's a lot more going on, which, of course, Switch 2 plays a lot of these.

1066
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:58,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered is out this week, as well as the game Uta Tomori no Yokai Yashiki is also out this week on the original Switch.

1067
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a game called the Irem Collection Volume 3, the Irem Collections.

1068
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:05,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a few of these recently.

1069
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:09,748
[SPEAKER_03]: This one has Mystic Riders, Dragon Breed, and Mr. Heli Battle Chopper.

1070
01:27:09,828 --> 01:27:09,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

01:27:39,091 --> 01:27:41,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's the name of the game.

1073
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:48,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's childhood adventures in 3D recreations of quaint shopping districts and single car trains.

1074
01:27:48,676 --> 01:27:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, our pal Shane is over in Japan right now.

1075
01:27:53,975 --> 01:27:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: and rode the Oshawott train today for the first time.

1076
01:27:56,678 --> 01:27:59,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know there's a whole fucking train that's themed Oshawott?

1077
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:00,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking at that on this blue sky.

1078
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:02,404
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I'm not surprised that you wrote it.

1079
01:28:02,544 --> 01:28:07,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, oh my god, it literally looks like Shane designed the train.

1080
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:15,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Oshawott seats, little plush Oshawotts they leave on the seats, little Oshawott designs on the carpet, on the side of the train.

1081
01:28:15,698 --> 01:28:19,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, Oshawott threw up all over the inside of this thing.

1082
01:28:19,522 --> 01:28:20,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But look, hey, look.

1083
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:25,409
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was Bad Bats Maru, I'd want to go on the train as well.

1084
01:28:25,429 --> 01:28:27,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get it.

1085
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to yuck somebody's yum, but it was just a lot.

1086
01:28:33,739 --> 01:28:37,844
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 5, that same Iram Collection Volume 3 is coming out.

1087
01:28:37,884 --> 01:28:41,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver 1 and 2 Remastered, also out on PlayStation 5.

1088
01:28:41,589 --> 01:28:47,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Police Simulator Patrol Officers at Cab includes Police Simulator players.

1089
01:28:47,516 --> 01:28:51,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's it for Japan this week.

1090
01:28:51,772 --> 01:28:53,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how about the UK?

1091
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:08,286
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got College Football 26 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, and Patapon 1 and 2 replay on Switch.

1092
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:10,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1093
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:29,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just realized this whole time my mic was off.

1094
01:29:29,646 --> 01:29:33,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was I was wondering why you weren't responding.

1095
01:29:33,514 --> 01:29:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.

1096
01:29:34,336 --> 01:29:34,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try again.

1097
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:37,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we've got one more story for you.

1098
01:29:37,463 --> 01:29:43,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to do with this something we were talking about last week with Mind's Eyes release.

1099
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, interesting follow up, huh?

1100
01:29:46,362 --> 01:29:51,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like when... It's not even just necessarily this company.

1101
01:29:51,311 --> 01:29:54,176
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't like when, for example, what was it?

1102
01:29:54,757 --> 01:29:56,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Ghostbusters 2016.

1103
01:29:58,323 --> 01:30:01,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these other Marvel series and stuff like that.

1104
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:05,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Where if you don't like it, it's because of this reason.

1105
01:30:05,195 --> 01:30:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not because it's bad.

1106
01:30:07,178 --> 01:30:09,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because, oh, well, you're racist.

1107
01:30:09,182 --> 01:30:10,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, oh, you just...

1108
01:30:10,544 --> 01:30:19,115
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you are... Clearly, the bad reviews for this game that, with my own eyes, can see is bad.

1109
01:30:19,595 --> 01:30:25,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't need someone to tell me it's bad, they just show me, here's some gameplay from the game, and I'm like, yeah, that looks bad.

1110
01:30:26,344 --> 01:30:29,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Clearly, this is sabotage.

1111
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:33,733
[SPEAKER_07]: At least, that's what Leslie Benzies is trying to...

1112
01:30:34,844 --> 01:30:44,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Convince everybody that rough launch on Saboteurs and that they are promising the relaunch of Mind's Eye in the future.

1113
01:30:46,117 --> 01:30:52,248
[SPEAKER_07]: The saboteurs, or people that were talking bad about the game, didn't make the game bad to begin with.

1114
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:54,833
[SPEAKER_07]: You made the game bad to begin with.

1115
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:58,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I have a hard time believing that.

1116
01:30:58,379 --> 01:31:04,831
[SPEAKER_07]: But they said that there is a concerted effort by someone to ruin the game's reputation before release.

1117
01:31:05,913 --> 01:31:07,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this someone in the room?

1118
01:31:08,217 --> 01:31:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like...

1119
01:31:09,185 --> 01:31:10,607
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

1120
01:31:11,668 --> 01:31:21,181
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't know what the game was because you were showing us weird cinematic trailers all the time and then you release the game and it's absolute garbage.

1121
01:31:22,142 --> 01:31:26,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember when the people in charge used to take accountability?

1122
01:31:26,928 --> 01:31:27,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember that?

1123
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember Iwata?

1124
01:31:28,871 --> 01:31:30,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember people that take accountability?

1125
01:31:32,396 --> 01:31:34,298
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, it's been a while.

1126
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,443
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1127
01:31:36,463 --> 01:31:44,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, I think suffice to say it's yeah, you could you could throw whatever reasons you want out there, buddy.

1128
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But the call is coming from inside the house.

1129
01:31:46,713 --> 01:31:47,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1130
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:50,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's just it's bad looking like it looks bad.

1131
01:31:50,536 --> 01:31:57,523
[SPEAKER_07]: The reviews like when people show reviews for a game, like especially a video review, like you're seeing the gameplay.

1132
01:31:57,703 --> 01:31:58,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see it with my own eyes.

1133
01:31:59,024 --> 01:32:01,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that someone's telling me, oh, this is bad.

1134
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:22,763
[SPEAKER_07]: and I look at that gameplay I'm like well it looks fine to me but if they're saying it's bad it must be bad no it looks like trash it looks like a game that is not cooked enough that you need to spend a lot more time on that somebody who used to be in charge of like the Grand Theft Auto franchise should do better it's dated it has dated gameplay mechanics it's

1135
01:32:24,194 --> 01:32:25,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1136
01:32:25,035 --> 01:32:35,708
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of these games where you have, you know, somebody that is the top of their game for this one series and then they strike out on their own and you're like, well, I mean, they did a great job with Mega Man, so Mighty No.

1137
01:32:35,728 --> 01:32:37,109
[SPEAKER_07]: 9 should be great, right?

1138
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:38,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1139
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1140
01:32:48,022 --> 01:32:52,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because some people on the internet are ridiculous all the time.

1141
01:32:52,811 --> 01:33:01,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Ironheart, you know, some people have a problem with diversity.

1142
01:33:01,246 --> 01:33:04,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have a problem with it and will go out of their way to say so.

1143
01:33:04,892 --> 01:33:05,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.

1144
01:33:05,694 --> 01:33:10,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of people that will discount something strictly because of diversity or whatever.

1145
01:33:10,162 --> 01:33:17,914
[SPEAKER_07]: That said though, there's also people that will use that claim to mask actual hate for the stuff.

1146
01:33:17,934 --> 01:33:19,556
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, She-Hulk.

1147
01:33:19,696 --> 01:33:20,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated that series.

1148
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:21,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1149
01:33:21,819 --> 01:33:22,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was stupid.

1150
01:33:23,422 --> 01:33:25,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just poorly written.

1151
01:33:25,945 --> 01:33:32,355
[SPEAKER_07]: The concept sounded like it would be really cool, and then they just went and twisted it around and like...

1152
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:38,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Just made it some cringe fest thing and they're like, well, you just hate it because you're a chauvinistic pig or something like that.

1153
01:33:38,473 --> 01:33:40,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, it's poorly written.

1154
01:33:42,224 --> 01:33:42,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

1155
01:33:42,705 --> 01:33:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

1156
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:48,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now we're going to get to the listener roundtable.

1157
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:55,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take your questions in chat and then your emails and maybe some calls in our Discord server over in the green room.

1158
01:33:56,484 --> 01:34:01,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot I need to pull up the mailbag because DarkSakura isn't here and I know there was at least one email tonight.

1159
01:34:02,431 --> 01:34:05,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need just a minute here.

1160
01:34:05,174 --> 01:34:10,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any last minute stories, Loki, while I try to pull up the email?

1161
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:10,560
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1162
01:34:10,912 --> 01:34:16,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I, I forgot to mention when I said that Romero, the Romero game, uh, game was canceled.

1163
01:34:16,742 --> 01:34:18,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the studio has been closed down.

1164
01:34:18,725 --> 01:34:21,370
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a little bit worse that their whole studio went down.

1165
01:34:22,251 --> 01:34:27,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, speaking of that Marvel series, like what I was going to say, there's a lot of their TV series have not been good.

1166
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:31,406
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, it's surprising because a lot of that stuff, like I love She-Hulk as a character.

1167
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:32,468
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't like the show.

1168
01:34:32,488 --> 01:34:34,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the show was awful.

1169
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:35,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Echo, God damn.

1170
01:34:36,578 --> 01:34:59,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope this email finds you well.

1171
01:34:59,206 --> 01:35:05,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy belated pride from a listener and friend who's plural, one side demi-masculine, one side trans-feminine.

1172
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Bisexual, polyamorous, demiromantic, and autistic And also, since it's July 4th as we write this And there's a quote here, a screenshot saying This whole thing smacks of gender, I holler As I overturn my uncle's barbecue grill And turn the 4th of July into the 4th of shit I think most people that are not interested in celebrating the 4th of July figured this out But July the 4th happens to be the birthday of the Caesar salad

1173
01:35:34,004 --> 01:35:45,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was at a local bar which has an outdoor section and they were lighting off fireworks, I made sure to proclaim happy birthday to the Caesar salad because that is the only thing we are celebrating today.

1174
01:35:47,281 --> 01:35:49,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes.

1175
01:35:49,604 --> 01:35:51,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy birthday, Caesar salad.

1176
01:35:51,026 --> 01:36:01,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you all had a great celebration celebrating the anniversary of such a yummy dish, which, by the way, I think you all know by now, but it was not invented in Italy.

1177
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a casino in Tijuana.

1178
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:07,364
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think was named Caesar's or the guy that ran it was named Caesar.

1179
01:36:07,425 --> 01:36:08,910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's called that.

1180
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:12,583
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the Caesar salad was invented in Tijuana.

1181
01:36:12,648 --> 01:36:18,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, first of all, an analogy to express my thoughts on a certain console maker's nonsense.

1182
01:36:19,616 --> 01:36:29,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Spillfencer demolishes half of his house, leaving only the kitchen and living room, then tells his family that he had to make difficult decisions, but that their house is looking better than ever.

1183
01:36:30,528 --> 01:36:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all that place.

1184
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:33,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We can extend the garden.

1185
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:37,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of all that garden we can have now.

1186
01:36:39,783 --> 01:36:40,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1187
01:36:40,644 --> 01:36:50,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, with the Stop Killing Games initiative back in full force after a harassment counter campaign, I often think about this as of late because I play a lot of modern rhythm games, i.e.

1188
01:36:50,376 --> 01:36:55,802
[SPEAKER_03]: those made within the last 10 years, like Chunathim, Mai Mai, Archaea, and Easy 2 On.

1189
01:36:55,842 --> 01:37:06,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of modern rhythm games have some form of DRM or another to prevent playing if you're offline, or at least debuffing a lot of the functionality in the case of Archaea.

1190
01:37:06,175 --> 01:37:08,079
[SPEAKER_07]: or Dance Dance Revolution nowadays.

1191
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:09,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an interesting one.

1192
01:37:10,163 --> 01:37:13,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's because of the music rights.

1193
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:22,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So that puts a whole other twist on things where when you have the music rights that come into play, now you sort of have to protect that

1194
01:37:22,527 --> 01:37:39,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Game, or else they're not going to license those songs to you from being able to do a lot with that offline or strip the music out, especially if we're talking about like in some of the old, you know, 2DX actually had like the master cuts to an extent because, you know, the instrumentation was actually tied to the buttons.

1195
01:37:39,913 --> 01:37:45,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So they actually had to have like the master recordings to strip out certain sound effects of the vocals and isolate those.

1196
01:37:45,141 --> 01:37:46,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that can get dumped on

1197
01:37:46,523 --> 01:37:59,157
[SPEAKER_03]: or Get Out There Somehow, it can cause people to do whatever they want with those songs, which, you know, the record labels don't really like, even though, you know, all this time later, that's all out there for all those old 2DX games.

1198
01:37:59,177 --> 01:37:59,838
[SPEAKER_03]: But I digress.

1199
01:37:59,978 --> 01:38:08,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with the music games in particular, they have to put the walls up a little bit higher because that's the only way they're going to convince the record labels to give them the licenses.

1200
01:38:08,668 --> 01:38:10,270
[SPEAKER_03]: But even with those games...

1201
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:18,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I think once they pull them offline, anything that you bought, you should still be able to play, licensed or not.

1202
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:30,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, only a scant few rhythm games, at least on PC and mobile, made in the last 10 or so years don't have online DRM, most notably Fygros and Orzmic, both of which are non-profit games.

1203
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:33,051
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the huge twist.

1204
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:41,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade rhythm games, at least many of them going out of service, get offline patches so they can be played even after cessation of service, albeit in reduced forms.

1205
01:38:41,466 --> 01:38:45,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't save scores, can't save options, some songs are missing.

1206
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:48,498
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens to mobile-based rhythm games when they reach end of service?

1207
01:38:49,259 --> 01:38:54,128
[SPEAKER_03]: One notorious example is Love Live Live.

1208
01:38:54,108 --> 01:39:06,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Live School Idol Festival, a somewhat infamous hybrid of gacha game and rhythm game, with all the your scores depend on how powerful and rare your cards are that entails.

1209
01:39:06,123 --> 01:39:10,950
[SPEAKER_03]: The original game shut down after a little over 10 years and can no longer be played.

1210
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:19,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Then came Love Live School Idol Festival 2, which was shut down after only one year in Japan, and perhaps even more notoriously had its global version release date 8th.

1211
01:39:19,741 --> 01:39:22,023
[SPEAKER_03]: and Shutdown announced at the same time.

1212
01:39:22,384 --> 01:39:24,606
[SPEAKER_03]: The poor thing lived only three months.

1213
01:39:25,227 --> 01:39:29,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this screenshot of an announcement that says, this is wild.

1214
01:39:30,753 --> 01:39:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I show this without showing the whole damn mailbox?

1215
01:39:33,796 --> 01:39:34,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1216
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:34,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I can show it this way.

1217
01:39:36,979 --> 01:39:40,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me show this on the other screen without the token visible.

1218
01:39:41,364 --> 01:39:43,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so...

1219
01:39:43,366 --> 01:39:45,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Global launch notice.

1220
01:39:45,509 --> 01:39:49,074
[SPEAKER_03]: We are excited to break the news to you that the global version of Love Live!

1221
01:39:49,134 --> 01:39:52,759
[SPEAKER_03]: School Idol Festival 2 Miracle Live is launching soon in February 2024.

1222
01:39:53,120 --> 01:40:00,250
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we also want to inform you that the global version will close its doors on May 31st and cease in-app purchases accordingly.

1223
01:40:01,452 --> 01:40:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

1224
01:40:03,054 --> 01:40:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when that came out.

1225
01:40:05,357 --> 01:40:07,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember something about that.

1226
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1227
01:40:09,522 --> 01:40:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1228
01:40:31,038 --> 01:40:55,071
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1229
01:40:55,051 --> 01:40:55,351
[SPEAKER_03]: .

1230
01:40:55,371 --> 01:40:55,412
[SPEAKER_03]: .

1231
01:40:55,432 --> 01:41:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: .

1232
01:41:16,043 --> 01:41:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: very infamously had that partnership with a different drum, that synth pop label out of Salt Lake City that gave us some bangers, right?

1233
01:41:23,451 --> 01:41:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we got Echo Image.

1234
01:41:25,053 --> 01:41:30,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we got, you know, we got a lot of great artists from that in those games.

1235
01:41:30,379 --> 01:41:42,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, my, I don't know if this is true, so do not quote me in an article somewhere, but I thought I remember hearing those songs were licensed for 50 bucks a pop.

1236
01:41:43,128 --> 01:42:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I remember hearing that somewhere along the way that it was like 50 bucks but think about but also but like on the flip side think about like they're kind of getting paid in exposure right like Echo Image made you know they sold albums based off that and and probably we were to help a little bit because we hyped the shit out of them but deserved I love Echo Image that's still Compufonics one of my favorite albums to this day quite honestly so um you know I I think you

1237
01:42:12,254 --> 01:42:20,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are probably able to license some songs very cheap because, yeah, it's...

1238
01:42:21,755 --> 01:42:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting paid in exposure, I guess.

1239
01:42:24,898 --> 01:42:31,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, all of this has me concerned for the sustainability of rhythm games, along with the constant demand for new content.

1240
01:42:31,585 --> 01:42:40,814
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always having to add new songs every month or two, or else the spoiled players will slam their fists at the metaphorical dinner table demanding, where's content?

1241
01:42:40,874 --> 01:42:42,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's content, dead game?

1242
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:45,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Move on, and then the game loses revenue and dies.

1243
01:42:45,498 --> 01:42:49,062
[SPEAKER_03]: In 10 years, let alone 20, will I still be able to play games like...

1244
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:52,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Roteno, The Funny Gyroscope Rhythm Game, and D4DJ.

1245
01:42:53,169 --> 01:43:02,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I also hope gacha game players will think about the Stop Killing Games initiative because gacha games by their nature require online DRM so that people can't save scum their roles.

1246
01:43:02,785 --> 01:43:15,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that a lot of gacha game players enjoy these games because they are often free to start and can be played on a device they probably already have as opposed to having a good enough PC or console for it, especially in Southeast Asia where people like anime stuff or

1247
01:43:15,046 --> 01:43:20,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the email.

1248
01:43:21,055 --> 01:43:43,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

1249
01:43:44,628 --> 01:44:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that there's more to consider but even in the gacha space if you paid money to get that song then you should have that song and you should be able to play it in that game in perpetuity I do believe that but it's going to be one of those things it's a hard nut to crack and I think at the end of the day it's probably just going to have to do with a lot of those agreements that you sign off on

1250
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The companies have been writing them for forever.

1251
01:44:14,494 --> 01:44:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for us to write ours.

1252
01:44:16,778 --> 01:44:24,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that note, if you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.

1253
01:44:24,753 --> 01:44:26,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other last minute stories for us tonight, Loki?

1254
01:44:27,322 --> 01:44:29,245
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1255
01:44:29,265 --> 01:44:29,546
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1256
01:44:30,027 --> 01:44:32,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then with that, we're going to wrap up the show.

1257
01:44:32,852 --> 01:44:34,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1258
01:44:34,915 --> 01:44:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate you all.

1259
01:44:36,077 --> 01:44:39,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the place where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1260
01:44:40,224 --> 01:44:41,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Help spread the word.

1261
01:44:41,406 --> 01:44:44,692
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice comment on social media.

1262
01:44:44,712 --> 01:44:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify.

1263
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:51,884
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube, wherever you found this going off a long way.

1264
01:44:51,924 --> 01:44:57,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you to everybody that sends and goes the extra mile and participates with the show.

1265
01:44:57,093 --> 01:44:59,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to those of you that turned out here live on Twitch this evening.

1266
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:02,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to those that listen to us on the podcast feed.

1267
01:45:02,563 --> 01:45:08,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you all have a wonderful week gaming and we'll be back in seven days to wrap up the news once again.

1268
01:45:08,092 --> 01:45:15,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, DarkSakura's not here, so she won't be streaming after the show tonight, but I'm sure she would have something to say here at the end.

1269
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:18,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think she already said FAC earlier on in the show.

1270
01:45:19,066 --> 01:45:21,229
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll be streaming throughout the week on her channel.

1271
01:45:21,269 --> 01:45:24,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You can check her out on Twitch at DarkSakuraTTV.

1272
01:45:24,333 --> 01:45:27,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give her a nice plug there in absence of a final thought.

1273
01:45:27,156 --> 01:45:29,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, your final thought tonight?

1274
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:34,726
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is that I'd like to get working on my modded series already.

1275
01:45:35,888 --> 01:45:37,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a lot of fun.

1276
01:45:37,876 --> 01:45:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is I need to beat the main story in Fantasy Life already.

1277
01:45:42,423 --> 01:45:49,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep getting distracted by crafting and leveling up jobs, but literally everybody who's in Endgame in that game says stop getting distracted by that.

1278
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:52,418
[SPEAKER_03]: You can catch up and do that stuff later after the story.

1279
01:45:52,438 --> 01:45:53,780
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's hard.

1280
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to level everything up equally.

1281
01:45:56,985 --> 01:45:58,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything leveling equally.

1282
01:45:58,868 --> 01:46:03,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And why won't the game drop a goddamn woodcutter strangling?

1283
01:46:03,435 --> 01:46:05,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a woodcutter in my party.

1284
01:46:06,108 --> 01:46:08,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one thing I'm missing.

1285
01:46:08,151 --> 01:46:09,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a woodcutter, Fantasy Life.

1286
01:46:09,634 --> 01:46:11,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you.

1287
01:46:11,236 --> 01:46:13,119
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, have a wonderful night, everybody.

1288
01:46:13,139 --> 01:46:33,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodbye.

1289
01:46:34,778 --> 01:46:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know they were all still true.

1290
01:46:47,237 --> 01:46:48,501
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week.
