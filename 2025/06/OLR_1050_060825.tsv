7895	11660	Should I even write a June intro at this point?
11740	14624	The headline has been a foregone conclusion for the entirety of the show's life.
14884	16707	I can let the music run alone, it's a bop.
16727	22995	But yes, I should, especially since I started avoiding the lead story, though that's harder when the entire show is basically made up of one overarching story.
23255	29143	When I want to reference the lead, I pick one specific aspect about it, not quite burying the lead, but shining a light on an interesting aspect of it.
29123	34451	But I'm just the intro voice, the warm-up act, the 30 seconds plus or minus 10 to bring you into the next few hours of news.
34471	39439	This is the meta intro because you can probably guess what the show is going to cover, but which of the two stories are going to be the lead?
39459	43846	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the very active week in gaming news.
44086	46390	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.
48057	50462	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.
50502	55312	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
55332	58118	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
58198	63349	And poor Jason, our hardworking voiceover guy, I think has analysis paralysis with everything.
63329	89792	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
89772	93998	Every week I'm joined by my co-host, except not tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
94038	100887	Unfortunately, was unable to attend tonight as, you know, she talks a lot about her ballet hobby and dance passion and stuff.
100947	103049	And she has a big event for all of that going on tonight.
103069	106394	So she wasn't able to be here as well, but she'll be back next week.
106494	109318	But we do have the one and only Techmaster Loki here tonight.
109378	109798	Hi, Loki.
110800	111080	Hello.
111280	111861	How are you doing?
112802	113463	I'm doing all right.
113483	115746	It's been a busy week for games, hasn't it?
115912	116874	It sure has.
116894	123671	Is it just me or is this the closest it's felt to like an E3 week since COVID lockdowns, since like 2020?
123711	127681	To me, this feels the closest to like E3 week since those days.
128002	133836	I mean, yeah, I mean, it feels like this every year when we do, when they have Summer Games Fest and all this stuff.
133816	134697	Is it though?
134718	144995	Because I feel like the games from like Sony and Microsoft and, you know, maybe Nintendo hasn't had the announcements, but their console launch is sort of an announcement.
145035	146397	It's sort of, you know, a similar thing.
146778	149142	Like, I feel like that sort of uplifts
149122	175011	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
174991	198754	Forge is overly generic.
198734	199796	Yeah, yeah.
199856	204122	So I feel like Summer Game Fest has kind of always been in that weird sort of mid spot.
204563	216601	Whereas when it comes to what they do with the Game Awards, I don't know if it's because it's a different time of year or what, but that's always felt like the announcements there are sort of a little bit elevated compared to what we have at Summer Game Fest.
216621	219966	Again, I'm trying to choose my words carefully here because I'm not trying to knock on it.
219946	221549	I appreciate the event.
221569	225375	I know especially since there isn't an E3, it's something to do in the LA area.
225776	229723	Again, there were things that I liked in that as well, but I just, I don't know.
229823	236755	I don't get as excited about that as I do the Game Awards, and then I'm really taking the whole thing into account.
236775	241583	Like, just the fact, and honestly, Loki, it's not just also...
242035	248946	Nintendo console, Sony event, Xbox event, Summer Game Fest, but then it's like everything else around Summer Game Fest, right?
249307	260044	Day of the Devs, then there's a Devolver thing, then there's a women-fronted game announcements, there's, you know, BIPOC game announcements, there's all these, like, industry...
260024	275113	I don't know, I feel like it's kind of energizing.
275802	291769	E3VL Overwhelmed by content
291749	309555	Thank you for watching!
309535	310777	I was able to catch up.
310797	311298	There's plenty.
311538	312840	That's what social media is for.
312961	315505	That's what news gaming websites are for.
316006	316847	I got caught up.
316867	317788	I know what they talked about.
318209	321434	You can't always watch everything live in the moment, and that's okay.
321454	324299	So don't feel too overwhelmed this time of year.
324680	334075	You can't see every game on the E3 show floor back in the day, and you can't watch every single games announcement this time of year either.
334375	346508	Alright, well then the other thing that sort of complicates people's ability to watch gaming wrap-ups and summaries and announcements is that a new console got dropped on people's laps this week.
346588	347409	Finally!
347429	348831	This is a big week.
349772	351654	I see that face you're making, Loki.
352435	353656	It's not a console.
353836	354677	It's not a console?
355238	359903	Yeah, we're gonna call this ROGLI, which there have already been some in the past.
359923	361885	I'm talking about the Switch 2, Loki!
362287	375685	Oh, I thought you were talking about that.
375725	389543	Yeah, that is a new console.
389523	417960	so this and you know uh it's it's a big we haven't had a console launch since 2020 and we all know that 2020 was fucky and the consoles didn't really launch the same way we didn't have like the big midnight midnight releases and shit like we had so if you think about it this would be the first time we've had like a major midnight console release lines at best buy and shit since what the switch one probably the switch one was probably the last time we had this
417940	421887	So it's really a throwback in some ways.
421907	423048	But let's talk about the Switch 2.
423569	426033	Loki, you got yours over the weekend, right?
426494	427576	How did the launch go for you?
427596	428678	You got your console.
428698	430561	What have you been kind of like playing on it?
431703	432724	Just Mario Kart World.
432765	437292	And I haven't really been playing because my son took it and I haven't been able to see it since then.
437352	438514	The joys of family.
439557	450995	No, I set it all up and everything, and I did play through Grand Prix, and I watched him play some of the stuff, but, like, yeah, I mean, you know, Mario Kart World is certainly a gorgeous-looking game.
451356	461992	I just... It's, like, it's... I think everything with, like, the Switch 2 seems to be, like, this is really great, but then there's this one thing that's just, like, not quite right.
462053	462694	Like, why?
463094	464096	Why is this a thing?
465598	467421	You know, like, in Mario Kart...
467570	471057	World, one of the things that kind of stood out to me is kind of weird.
471077	479935	Aside from, like, the fact that you can't do co-op free roam split screen, which, like, really?
480296	482460	Your console cannot handle that?
482561	484785	Like, I'm just...
485035	489260	I'm confused as to why that's such a thing.
489340	494267	Why your game is so unoptimized in that sense that it really cannot run that.
494527	502817	And I get it, the world is big and everything, but we were doing split-screen, open-world racing games back on the Xbox 360 just fine.
502897	505441	So why is this any different?
505461	506622	I just don't...
506602	524475	I can't fathom that.
524911	535456	When you do that, the game drops down the level of detail incredibly low, and the framerate is so low on that.
536158	538363	So to me, it's just like...
539170	541995	Why was this even a thing that you added to the game?
542055	545942	Why is this a feature in the game when it doesn't represent the game very well?
545962	553175	It doesn't really add anything, and it really shows... This brand new console that you just put out shows how underpowered it is.
553295	558124	It's so confusing to me why they would even treat it like that.
559086	559947	Um...
559927	583167	and that aside too like you know I'm hearing now with like the teardowns of the Switch 2 and stuff like that and the Joy-Cons and how oh hey the Joy-Con it seems like that the thumbsticks are exactly the same as the old ones so cool so we're gonna get drifting issues with these $90 controllers in like a few months I mean like do we not learn our lesson with this stuff I just don't understand but
583923	591250	that's kind of like my whole take on it it's like it's a really good piece of hardware that game is you know really good but like
592411	595777	I'm holding it to that $80 price point standard.
595997	603250	And some of the stuff that's in there just feels poorly implemented in this generation of gaming.
603410	604732	And I get it.
605173	608779	Certain games don't have split screen and stuff like that anymore.
609260	614529	But it feels like you could have possibly been able to implement that somehow.
614669	616292	I can't imagine that...
617521	619565	I don't know.
621829	640103	I don't know.
640083	641085	I don't know if I agree.
641185	642246	I mean, I have to be honest.
642407	647915	I haven't spent a ton of time on Mario because I've been playing something else, and I'll talk about that in a minute.
647935	657450	But I haven't been playing as much Mario Kart World because I've been going back and visiting Switch 1 upgraded games and playing them the way I really wish I would have been able to play them from the beginning.
657430	675372	but I do think you have a point that like when you're in the free realm and maybe this is because of the fact that the tracks have been scoped out to hold 24 people when you're on them by yourself the the free roam actually kind of feels a little bit empty now I've played I've played a very which and
675352	678356	Before y'all come at me, because I know the Nintendo fans are ready to snap.
678777	691055	Yes, I've seen all the really cute artistic flares and some of the things that only Nintendo can do, like the buses loading up people and the drive-thru where Yoshi is actually working at the drive-thru and waves throughout the window.
691295	696863	Yes, I'm not saying the world is devout of life, but it does seem very odd.
697044	700789	It just seems like two very different sort of design choices, right?
701230	704194	You have racetracks that are wide enough to support...
704174	707460	24 people, which is a lot for a Mario Kart game.
707480	711648	And then you have this free roam that's limited to just you, right?
711808	714874	Or, you know, I know there's ways to... Yeah, there's the workaround.
714914	715455	That's the thing.
715495	719483	It's like, so we can do a workaround and get it to somewhat work.
719463	721446	Why not just make that the thing?
721506	727696	My honest question is, is free roam really bringing enough to this game?
728277	729159	You know, and I don't know yet.
729219	730260	I don't know the answer to that yet.
730381	731603	I haven't played it enough yet.
731983	734367	So maybe I'm going to come back in a couple months and change my mind.
734387	735649	Maybe it was a big highlight of their...
735629	759983	I think even the most hardcore of the Nintendo fans need to really stop for a moment and pause and maybe consider the people bitching about the $80 price tag have a point.
761093	765140	So, uh... But, the game is fun!
765902	766964	You could balance that.
766984	770851	You could balance that with, you know, free roam.
770871	776101	You could even tone it down, like, detail-wise for multiplayer, if you want.
776141	779828	That's what, like, multiplayer games have been doing forever when it comes to split-screen.
780789	781110	Um...
781090	783737	The racing is really fun and I really like the knockout tour.
783877	786905	I really like the one giant long track.
786925	788750	That is really fun, I'm going to say.
788770	794665	And that is something that the free world approach, I guess, sort of brings to the game that wouldn't have been there otherwise.
795046	797192	So I do really like the free roam element.
798252	801736	I'm sorry, the knockout element and how it utilizes the free roam.
802397	803198	So there is that.
803939	808926	But it does feel very different from other Mario Kart games, which isn't a bad thing.
809046	809627	I mean, right?
809647	815194	Like, I think we'd also be bitching if it was like, oh, it's just the same fucking Mario Kart game with some new tracks.
815554	818658	I understand the creative push to do something really different.
818678	825007	But it is a little bit jarring when the first eight Mario Kart games have essentially been the same thing.
825307	825407	Yeah.
825387	845607	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
845587	849413	I'm totally fine with the new take on it.
849453	850615	I think it's good.
850655	861612	Spoilers, sort of, I guess, but there is a Mario Circuit track that goes through the first three Mario Circuits from the Super Nintendo game, one after another.
862033	863916	That is super cool.
863896	872024	The end of that first circuit that has the Donkey Kong rafters, that's incredible.
872265	874847	So some of the course design is phenomenal.
874867	875548	It really is.
875568	876309	No, it's really good.
876829	877911	Hold on, hold on.
878211	878771	Alan's here.
878872	882415	He just made a Costco trip, and I think he brought me... Oh, boy.
883016	883737	Yay.
884277	885538	Tariff free.
885939	887881	Look what Alan got me at Costco.
887921	890263	It's a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller.
890524	891525	Do you know why this is important?
891545	892806	It comes from Costco?
893613	894014	$75.
894335	900869	You don't have to pay for the tariffs and all that stuff because you get the Costco discount for being a Costco member.
900889	901550	That's terrific.
901931	903395	It is terrific.
903415	909448	It sure is because we're going to buy all the food we fucking eat there anyway.
909548	911352	So yeah, no, it's great.
912243	918272	I just want it to be like, you know, it's like, I'm not saying the game's bad at any means whatsoever.
918292	923599	I'm just saying, like, I am going to scrutinize it extra hard because it is $80.
923660	923940	Yes.
924541	926504	I think that's fair.
926804	927465	That's fair.
927826	930910	This is the first game to ever charge $80.
931328	941805	And so we should be saying, what does this bring to the conversation that justifies $10 more than, you know, some of these new PlayStation 5 games and things like that?
941825	942986	So, yeah.
943006	950138	Yeah, and I think... So here's my prediction here, and this is strictly based off of Mario Kart World.
950158	956408	So my prediction in the future with how they're going to approach adding... Because how do you add new tracks to this?
956448	957910	Because obviously...
957890	962016	The world is already existing the way it is, so how do you add new tracks to it?
962196	963138	I think they don't.
963158	977559	I think instead they go the route of Grand Theft Auto 5 Online, where you can basically take this big open world and then create your own courses based off of driving from place to place and setting up stuff along that route and save that and share that.
977579	980824	So that's going to be a thing I predict that will come in the future.
981004	982446	I'm with E3VL in chat.
982607	984449	Islands, do it the way Forza does it.
984810	984910	Yeah.
984890	997498	I mean, this game's, yeah, islands, warp pipes, warp pipes, you drive in a warp pipe, and you go, come on, the perfect Nintendo answer, warp pipes, that's how you're gonna do it.
998542	1027232	so anyway what else about the Switch, so where did you get yours from because you got yours delivered to your house you didn't actually go to any midnight launches it's annoying because it did get delivered after the release date by a couple days despite the fact that I was literally their second one to order that thing so it's kind of annoying that somehow everybody got before me but whatever, we got it it's no big deal that it was a day or so late yeah
1027972	1033543	Yeah, and that's really, you know, Mario Kart was the only reason, you know, the only thing that we got on it right now.
1033583	1034886	We did all the transfer stuff.
1035607	1045006	I am scared to look at it because I've heard of horror stories where people have transferred their content and their saves and their Animal Crossing worlds are gone.
1045346	1045767	Oh, shit.
1045787	1048292	So, like, I'm not...
1048458	1071124	Yeah, I got it.
1071104	1090210	I gotta go and delete that stuff yeah that's the kind of thing I wish it gave me the option to like toggle what I wanted to move over or just like hey move over like the game card stuff but don't re-download everything just allow you to download it that's how it should have been but I don't know it's fine I guess and then um
1091573	1095618	Yeah, I mean, the eShop seems a little bit better, slightly.
1095638	1097300	It's usable, I guess.
1097820	1099262	It's much snappier.
1099482	1100664	That's the thing about the Switch.
1100724	1103867	It's just snappier in every sense of the word.
1103887	1108933	The interface is snappier, and the magnetic connection thing is so sad.
1108973	1115481	People are calling it the fidget toy of the year, although I'm not sure I would want to sit there and attach, reattach, reattach, reattach over and over and over again.
1115541	1121428	I feel like at some point, you're going to run the risk of wearing that shit out.
1121408	1133560	I had issues syncing my old Joy-Cons with it.
1133680	1139186	So I have an older set of Joy-Cons I got back closer to when I got my Switch originally.
1139346	1143911	And then I have a newer set I just bought for my wife not that long ago that are pink or whatever.
1144411	1146673	The pink ones were able to sync just fine.
1146914	1148395	The other ones...
1148375	1159767	I had to connect them to one of those controller attachment things and then plug it in to the Switch directly to get it to recognize.
1159887	1164272	And then when I unplugged it and tried to use them again, it wouldn't sync again.
1165293	1170778	So that's kind of annoying as well on a $500 piece of hardware.
1171199	1175523	That it should work just fine with your controllers because I got them to connect one time.
1175904	1177065	Why can't they...
1177670	1178511	Detected again.
1178912	1185483	And it wasn't that I had the other switch on or anything in the room, so I was confused as to which system to connect to.
1185864	1189590	It's completely shut off, so I don't know.
1189631	1190612	That's kind of annoying.
1192115	1202192	Like I said, I'm going to scrutinize this stuff extra hard because it is that expensive, and I expect perfect if I'm paying $80 for a game and $500 for a system.
1203657	1207082	I want to talk about my little launch night story.
1207142	1209225	So I had a pre-order from Best Buy.
1209366	1216456	So we went over there and thankfully, and I didn't even realize this was going to be a thing until like two days before.
1216476	1219280	But apparently we get West Coast privilege being in California.
1219721	1228634	So they were actually going to launch the system at 9pm our time because when it's 9pm here, it's midnight on the East Coast, which they do with some movies, right?
1228654	1230357	We
1230337	1255787	and so on.
1255767	1263476	So I think at some point the rule changed, but I wasn't really thinking about it until a couple days before the console launch.
1263496	1264718	So we went over there.
1265199	1266720	We did a little shopping beforehand.
1266800	1270465	I was like, you know, they'll probably have separate lines.
1270485	1272728	One of them will be for people who haven't gotten the console yet.
1272748	1275932	One will be for pre-orders, and that pre-order will go fast.
1275952	1280357	And so we kind of rolled up around 9.15.
1280337	1281799	And the line was already going.
1281859	1286805	It was one line going all the way around the building to the back.
1287265	1288827	We were out by the dumpsters.
1288847	1293032	And I made some very funny tongue-in-cheek comments like, Happy Pride Month.
1293092	1294694	They made us gaze-wait out by the dumpsters.
1294995	1295775	You know, things like that.
1295795	1296236	It's whatever.
1296576	1297397	It was fair.
1297638	1299860	We knew we were taking a chance, rolling in there late.
1299920	1301282	I'm actually not upset about it.
1301262	1312159	It was funny to look in the dumpster and see that there was Switch 1 standees and promo material for the original Switch that was sitting in the dumpster.
1312179	1319710	I'm surprised some of those Nintendo fanboys in line weren't dumpster diving to take that stuff because, I mean, people do that.
1319931	1320612	But it was there.
1321713	1324558	So we waited and waited and waited and we got towards the front of the line.
1324738	1328704	Then they started splitting it to two when you got towards the front.
1328684	1351063	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1351043	1366842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1366822	1382569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1382549	1389623	I just thought of it like Disneyland, except instead of getting on Space Mountain at the end, I was going to get a new console, which I haven't had in five years.
1389643	1390184	So you know what?
1390745	1391226	Wee!
1391507	1392369	It's fun.
1392389	1394072	I'm waiting for a ride.
1394092	1394793	And so it was fine.
1394813	1399863	And so we got our system, came home, and then it was that long process of transferring everything over.
1399883	1403190	But props to Nintendo for the servers not melting down.
1403170	1404532	Yeah, it wasn't too bad.
1404592	1410580	I realized that Mario Kart World was going to be a code instead of an actual full game.
1410741	1414906	It was a code, and so I had to put the code in and download it, but it went through.
1415367	1420394	It was relatively fast, and I was playing Pokemon Scarlet, which was the first game I wanted to play.
1420434	1424340	The minute I heard it was 60 frames a second, and when I saw the early footage, I was like, oh my god.
1424940	1430368	So my old save to load up by default in Scarlet, I was just blown away.
1430388	1431810	I was like, this is...
1432212	1439782	I was torn between this is an all-new game and this is the game we should have had the first time.
1439802	1441705	And I can't help Loki.
1441945	1443508	I know people wish I would shut up.
1443608	1444008	I don't care.
1444209	1445010	The answer is no.
1445751	1453461	I can't get out of my head that this really was supposed to be how it was supposed to be for us when this game launched.
1453481	1454743	It's just...
1454723	1463818	It's just too smooth and too good and too fast for this to be made or whatever for me not to believe that this is the way it was really supposed to be the whole time.
1463838	1467945	And I really think this Switch 2 was supposed to happen around the time we got the OLED Switch.
1468285	1479343	Maybe not with the same specs, maybe not in the exact same way, but I really believe that technology is, you know, it was out there for some developers and they were developing to it.
1479363	1481727	And it's why some of the later Switch games
1481707	1496728	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1496708	1498691	It's not perfect.
1498711	1504801	There's some weird bugs with floating Pokeballs and shadows do weird things, but it feels like the world is alive.
1505162	1507966	You really do see the Pokemon in the background doing things.
1507986	1511091	They're not just walking by like a game and watch.
1511392	1516059	They're actually walking, doing the thing in the grass, watching what's happening, getting behind you.
1516400	1518463	It just feels like the world's alive.
1518443	1520728	It's such a better game now.
1520808	1526841	And I'm not just saying that because I happened to catch a shiny Fletchling like 15 minutes into my play when I was streaming the other night.
1526861	1528825	It really does feel like an elevated experience.
1529306	1533515	And I saw a stupid take on social media, which what a surprise.
1533676	1534858	There's lots of stupid takes.
1535119	1537043	But I saw a stupid take that was...
1537023	1543952	If you just got a Switch 2 to play Switch 1 games, you're a problem because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1543972	1545754	And my answer to that is, fuck you.
1545934	1546415	Sit down.
1546535	1546936	Shut up.
1547016	1548938	Not everything needs to be posted on the internet.
1549399	1550460	Because you know what?
1550821	1556949	Like, do people buy higher-end PCs so that they can play their PC games at a better frame rate?
1556989	1562296	Do people buy new PCs, new MMOs, like when a new World of Warcraft expansion comes out?
1562316	1563557	Do I play on my higher-end PC?
1564078	1564178	Yeah.
1564158	1565720	Minecraft, right?
1566822	1567904	Shut up.
1567924	1570628	Shut up.
1570648	1573031	Let people enjoy things.
1573572	1581203	And if you want to buy a Switch 2 to re-enjoy your Switch 1 games, that's one of the best things this console has going for it out the gate.
1581243	1582184	Because let's be real.
1582585	1587052	There's like one new game that isn't on another console right now.
1587072	1589355	One new game exclusive to Switch.
1589335	1615258	in the moment and that's Mario Kart World now next month we'll have the Donkey Kong game soon we'll have Metroid Prime we'll see more stuff from third parties you know and I'm not saying things like Fantasy Life are probably a better experience on Switch 2 because of its portability than PlayStation 5 but that's the reality there isn't a lot to make this really special so I just don't understand where a take like that comes from to be honest
1616673	1626849	Um, let's see, uh, Rinmari68k in chat says gamers think politics and game communities are bad, but would gladly break toes of people who buy a Nintendo game they want.
1626929	1627170	Yes.
1628191	1630335	Uh, Truxius, I hope I said that name right.
1630355	1633179	I think it's True, True, Truexius, Truexius, I think.
1633199	1633961	Sorry if I'm saying that wrong.
1634221	1637406	Says I played PS4 games on my PS5 for a long time.
1637526	1638388	Exactly.
1638408	1639189	And you know what?
1639209	1643035	They're still releasing PlayStation 4 games on PlayStation 5.
1643015	1645260	Still, a lot of the things that weren't out.
1645280	1646182	PlayStation 4.
1646563	1649389	That brand new Capcom fighting collection.
1649589	1650712	That's a PS4 game.
1651634	1652856	And people are still playing it.
1653397	1654780	There's nothing wrong with it.
1655702	1656925	So, anyway.
1657646	1658408	Yeah.
1658557	1659679	Um, yeah.
1660060	1666531	Rin Mari in chat says, honestly, as obnoxious as Nintendo stands can be, Nintendo haters can be not right in the head either.
1666551	1667052	No, for sure.
1667112	1667873	For sure.
1667893	1671359	Uh, the gorilla 72 in chat asks, damn, where did he get that Donkey Kong cap?
1671399	1671880	I want one.
1671900	1672341	Well, thank you.
1672602	1674264	I actually don't remember where this came from.
1674285	1676869	I'm sorry to say it's a few years old, but look at the best part.
1676849	1702722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1703697	1707806	Anyway, yeah, entire class says you can probably find it online.
1707826	1714080	I should probably look for, I should probably look up the tag on who made this hat and see what other gaming hats they might have.
1714100	1718890	Because I would like to see if they have maybe some Zelda themed ones or some other ones that have the stuff.
1719111	1722077	It's just when I also, and this last thing I'll say that we can best switch to.
1722057	1741669	I also like hats that bend I like the bendy look on hats you know like some more like baseball hats no baseball hats are flat and trucker hats bend so I like the trucker hats a little better but this one's more of a flat one this is just taking a long time to get like just a little bendy so I don't love the flat ones as much as the bendy ones
1741649	1744236	So, but that's my hat hot take.
1744798	1746442	All right, back to Switch 2 hot takes.
1746984	1751236	So, Loki, what are you looking forward to next on Switch 2?
1751336	1755287	Like, what do you think happens with Switch 2 a few months down the line?
1755790	1759835	I mean, I'll probably get the Donkey Kong game just because it looks alright.
1760295	1762858	I'm not super excited about Donkey Kong.
1764079	1772729	Funny enough, probably we'll end up getting the new Sonic Racing Crossworlds game for obvious reasons.
1775332	1775772	I don't know.
1776373	1778435	I'm not really interested in Metroid Prime 4.
1779537	1781379	I just have to see what else gets announced.
1781599	1782540	I mean, really.
1783364	1787452	Well, unlike you, I'm very interested in Metroid Prime 4, so that's going to be next on my list.
1787472	1789496	But I don't know if I'm sold on Donkey Kong.
1789536	1790939	I'm going to wait and see.
1790959	1792462	I'm taking a wait-and-see approach to that one.
1792502	1794045	I don't think I need that one launch day, but I'll wait.
1794426	1796731	I can't wait to see how the GameCube collection expands.
1797152	1799577	Oh, have you tried any of the GameCube stuff?
1799597	1800799	I have not yet, no.
1800779	1801860	Pretty nice.
1801880	1810889	I don't know if it's just an effect of the emulator that you're using or whatever, but similar to some things you see on PC and like Dolphin and stuff.
1810909	1823442	I think those emulators are operating on a more level of trying to enhance the experience, whereas I think Nintendo is probably trying to do something that's really portable.
1823462	1827546	But because you now have things that are more textures and less sprites...
1827526	1838900	I feel like when I'm playing... I didn't play F-Zero yet because I'm going to do that on stream, but I played a little bit of Soul Calibur 2, and it was kind of neat to see that, wow, on the TV, this looks a little sharper.
1839401	1845549	I don't think anything is up-res per se, but it's the Illustrator versus Photoshop, right?
1845989	1852758	When you up-res a vector graphic, it's going to look a little better than a bitmap graphic that Photoshop makes because it's just that resolution.
1852778	1853719	Well, it's also because...
1853699	1857426	You know, when you first played it, you were playing it on a CRT TV as well.
1857446	1858047	That is fair.
1858207	1858908	Totally fair.
1859610	1860191	Yeah.
1860211	1861533	So it looked a little different back then.
1862996	1870068	DJ Ranma S in chat, I think he's talking about something else, but the comment made about it doesn't connect to your phone, which I think is about a smartwatch, which is a different topic.
1870509	1872673	But that reminded me one other thing.
1873054	1875558	Make sure you look at this if you haven't seen this yet.
1875578	1878323	The Nintendo Switch app got way better.
1878303	1899214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1899194	1925134	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1925114	1928098	So definitely check that feature out if you haven't seen it.
1928198	1933285	E3VL says, you can do stop charge at 90% in settings and save your battery long term.
1933305	1935468	Yes, that's another good feature to look for, that's for sure.
1936128	1940895	And Bobby Blackwell says, you can see the pixelation in the sprites they use for the UI in Soul Calibur.
1941015	1941636	Oh yeah, you can.
1941936	1946642	You can see the bitmap versus vector, the equivalent of that in the game design, for sure.
1947223	1951208	And F0GX cutscenes look rough.
1951228	1951469	Yeah.
1951629	1951729	Yeah.
1951709	1957202	The Pokemon Scarlet cutscenes look rougher than the game now, which wasn't the case on Switch 1.
1957542	1963817	But because they were rendered for the Switch 1 screen, which was a lower resolution, they don't look as good on the Switch.
1963857	1965621	They're not bad, but you can tell.
1965741	1970612	It's like, oh, it's a little pixelated, a little rough around the edges.
1972145	1990356	Kind of neat.
1990336	1994424	Night on VOG where we can all race each other since it's, you know, these huge races.
1994444	1998372	We will do something before Southern Fried, which is in two weeks.
1998392	2002239	So Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta is in two weeks.
2002260	2003722	So we won't be here live that night.
2003762	2004724	That's the 22nd.
2004845	2006067	I'll actually be flying...
2006047	2011632	I'll be at the Gaming Expo that morning, but I'm going right to the airport from the Expo to come home on Sunday.
2011652	2014694	So I'll be on an airplane by the time this show is on the air.
2015715	2018898	So we will not be live in two weeks on Sunday.
2019539	2023542	But before that Expo happens, we will do a Mario Kart night.
2023562	2028727	But we want to give you guys time to unlock things, get a little more used to it, because I have to be honest, I haven't played it a lot.
2029207	2033151	That's why I'm a little hesitant to share some of my opinions, because I fully admit they may still change.
2033491	2036053	The more I explore a free world, maybe my thoughts will change.
2036033	2043846	I've only cleared a few of the knockout and a few of the Grand Prix on 50cc to start the unlock process.
2044407	2049997	So I think we'll get to it maybe the end of this week or middle of next.
2050017	2055426	I know I'm still leaving it wide open, but I want to check with Bobby and my own schedule and stuff and just see what lines up.
2055406	2071896	so more to come on that but if you want to join in on that which I hope you will please join our discord server over at vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord that'll get you to our discord server and when that happens we will have all the info on discord in fact
2072602	2090602	I don't know how you connect to rooms and stuff, but if there's a code or something like that, it will be in the Discord to prevent randos on Twitch from joining, which I notice the more I've been streaming Pokemon Scarlet and that stuff again, people are like, oh, I'll get you a shiny so-and-so.
2090662	2091904	Let me end the game.
2091924	2092785	You can get a shiny so-and-so.
2092805	2095808	It's like, bitch, I know that's hacked.
2095788	2106744	So I don't want to interact with people I don't have at least a little bit of familiarity with because unfortunately some people on Twitch just want to Twitch bomb other users and, you know, whatever.
2107846	2112072	So we will post any codes and things like that in our Discord server.
2112092	2113875	Again, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
2113935	2115477	Okay, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2115497	2119223	I know we've talked a lot about Switch too, but maybe there's some other things we want to talk about as well.
2119243	2121306	Loki, I will let you start.
2122400	2124646	All right, well, I mean, there's so much.
2125407	2127854	So I guess, yeah, we could start with Sony real quick.
2128074	2129297	No, no, your gaming week.
2129337	2130259	Your gaming week, Loki.
2130540	2131302	Oh, my gaming week.
2131362	2131823	Oh, gosh.
2132325	2139362	Well, Mario Kart World and watching a lot of these different game events.
2139342	2151179	I played a little bit of Bellatro, a tiny bit of Minecraft actually because I've been still setting up like a mod pack for... I'm still setting up a mod pack for modded series.
2151480	2158330	It's a balance between what features I want and not melting my CPU and GPU from...
2158310	2160212	All of the mods running at once.
2160432	2177753	And it literally is, you know, I'm not exaggerating when I say not melting my CPU because I was getting up to 95 degrees Celsius on the CPU while it was processing, creating chunks with a bunch of mods running.
2177953	2180856	And that's with like an AIO of like 100% too.
2180956	2181617	So it's like...
2182087	2183409	Okay, need to take that one out.
2184671	2185332	That's not good.
2187395	2194926	But yeah, hopefully I'll be working on new stuff very soon in Channel 64.
2195107	2211351	Unfortunately, I'm at the point now where I have to start working on the Mega Game stuff, so it kind of slows everything down quite a bit, because I have to essentially do a lot of design work and planning behind the scenes before I can kind of
2211331	2220019	Get to the next step in my next episode, which would be making the external part of the the actual dungeon, I guess.
2220199	2235254	But being that I don't know what the size of the dungeon is or what it's going to look like or how it's going to be laid out, I kind of have to figure all that stuff out first before I start putting stuff into the world because I don't know how much space I need to allocate for myself and everything.
2235334	2239718	So I've been doing like other like making
2239917	2265165	you know quests and um just farms and stuff in between because at least that I can kill time with all right uh my gaming week outside of the Switch 2 I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 and last week on the show I talked about how I wasn't really enjoying the solo adventure on the new Crescent Island uh Occult Crescent the that whole content that they just patched in
2265145	2293043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2293023	2319334	I was playing a lot of Fantasy Life.
2319314	2339112	and DarkSakura.
2339632	2346041	It's still a fun game and something I will sink more time into around all these other games I need to be playing right now.
2346161	2347864	So it's a good time to be gaming, though.
2347884	2349106	I feel like there's just so much.
2349586	2368373	The Switch 2 is really, despite the criticisms and feedback of things in particular about Mario Kart World, I still think it really is just energized a lot in a way that we needed energy in the industry because unfortunately there's still a shit ton of layoffs going on.
2368353	2392048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2392028	2410678	Outriders, thank you DJ Ranma S, that was the name of it.
2410658	2411099	All right.
2411799	2412901	Well, that's our Gaming Weeks.
2413341	2418207	Now, Loki, we can try to tackle some of these announcements from the weekend.
2418507	2420409	Yeah, let's start with Sony's State of Play.
2420489	2424534	So they kind of came out first the day before the Switch launch.
2424935	2428118	And the other interesting thing is they didn't give us any warning.
2428138	2429120	Just the day before.
2429260	2431202	The day before, they said, tune in tomorrow.
2431863	2437509	And they gave us what you would expect to have been probably an E3 type of presentation.
2437589	2439872	It had that many heavy-hitting games in it, right?
2440055	2441859	I definitely, yeah, would agree with that.
2442339	2446187	So there was, yeah, quite a bit of stuff that was kind of exciting coming out of that.
2446207	2454924	So obviously for us, like right off the bat, we have Luminous Rise, which is essentially Tetris Effect, but Luminous.
2454944	2455465	Yes.
2455445	2480305	It's already amazing.
2480656	2506140	We're cheap now, I think.
2507268	2509853	I do miss the licensed music.
2509873	2518129	I do miss, there was a certain charm that Luminous 2, I almost said Shinen 2 because I was looking at Renmari's comment.
2518149	2528770	There's a certain charm that Luminous 2 on the PSP had with all that silly licensed music in it that we were supposed to get on the 360 that never happened.
2529307	2537180	I've told this story before, but I remember at E3, I got to play Madonna in Luminous Xbox 360, which never happened.
2537200	2538782	They never released it.
2538802	2542568	It was only ever at that E3 where you could play Sorry by Madonna in Luminous.
2543089	2544932	So I don't know what happened.
2545052	2546635	Licensing disagreements or something.
2547156	2551643	So yeah, Rimari says, the pleasure of making colored squares to holla back, girl.
2551703	2554367	Seriously, there's something kind of charming about that whole thing.
2554387	2556090	It had a great song list.
2556070	2560203	There's a lot of good songs in it.
2560624	2565861	So I will miss the licensed songs a little bit, but...
2566651	2569113	Do we know if there's no licensed songs on it?
2569293	2586869	I guess we don't for sure, but the trailer had what was almost certainly the same creative minds, which I think is just Tetsuya Mizuguchi's group or something, but the same creative minds around I'm Yours Forever, which was the Tetris Effect song, almost certainly did that song that was in the Luminous trailer.
2586889	2591973	I mean, we don't know for sure, but you know, that's a safe prediction for me.
2593094	2595136	But Luminous Rise, really excited about it.
2595156	2596017	Can't wait to play it.
2597178	2598099	Yeah, it looked really good.
2599622	2602747	We had another game, Pragmata, which looked interesting.
2603007	2608295	It had this little girl and some AI robot thing.
2608896	2611561	Oh yeah, it was kind of sci-fi-ish sort of thing, right?
2611581	2612602	Yeah, it was interesting.
2613343	2617871	I was getting Megan vibes from it, but not quite.
2618912	2619353	If only.
2620014	2620114	Yeah.
2620094	2628609	and then Romeo is a Dead Man, which I immediately pegged the Suda51 grasshopper manufacturer vibes from.
2628709	2631674	I'm like, yep, yep, yeah, that's it.
2631754	2634018	It looks like a hack and slash game, so it looks pretty cool.
2634799	2640369	We got an extended trailer for Silent Hill F, which is coming out September 25th.
2640389	2643013	It looks pretty good.
2643483	2665491	Bloodstained the Scarlet Engagement so I guess a sequel to Bloodstained and it's going to be at least have two player co-op in it it looks pretty cool we have a Digimon Story Time Stranger I don't know I'm not a huge Digimon fan but it looks neat
2665640	2669264	Final Fantasy Tactics, The Eyeless Chronicles.
2669465	2674511	God, the worst kept rumor secret in the fucking industry, finally.
2674531	2674891	We know.
2674971	2686345	And Creative Business Unit 3, the Final Fantasy XIV team working on it, which is not too big of a shock when you consider that team is made up of a lot of the people that worked on the Evil East games to begin with.
2686365	2689369	So there's a lot of folks there that worked on the original.
2689349	2691794	Very curious to see what else they put in the enhanced version.
2691814	2694719	Because you have the enhanced version and the original version, right?
2695120	2701352	Although I don't think we should expect anything from advanced or nothing outside of what was in vanilla.
2701372	2702154	We should expect.
2702755	2707163	But I will be curious what changes they might make to the difficulty, if any.
2708566	2710750	Because Tactics was a fucking hard game.
2710730	2712512	Yes.
2713894	2714635	No!
2714735	2722364	I don't like other people.
2722504	2722684	Me.
2723045	2737142	Yeah.
2737122	2756987	and fine, but let other people you know, have the little tweaks that help them see the whole story I'll be curious if they rebalance stuff, for sure but I'm really excited this is coming Baby Steps got another trailer, that's the one from Developer Digital, it's kind of like QWOP as a walking sim, but you know, obviously
2758047	2759269	It's going to be frustrating.
2760230	2763114	That's coming out September 8th on PlayStation 5.
2763775	2771445	We had Hirogami, which is a cool-looking origami paper-inspired RPG type thing.
2771565	2772786	Really cool aesthetic on that.
2772907	2775991	That's coming out on PlayStation 5 on September 3rd.
2776792	2786805	Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, brand new entry into that, including they have some unlockable characters with Pac-Man they showed off in the trailer.
2786887	2789732	Who gets excited about Pac-Man in golfing games?
2789752	2790212	I don't know.
2790593	2791274	Not me.
2791294	2793818	But September, coming out there.
2794279	2798025	Another trailer for Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, which I think we saw.
2798045	2798526	Ooh, that looked cool.
2799006	2799607	Yeah.
2799627	2800449	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2800489	2802252	We'd seen it before, but still.
2802552	2808742	I think it was either at the Game Awards or maybe at another PlayStation Direct or something.
2808762	2810565	But yeah, it looked really cool.
2810545	2816474	Karen, which is a survival climbing experience.
2816795	2821763	I remember talking about this one before, but that's coming now on November 5th.
2821883	2824407	But there is a demo out for that.
2824427	2827091	The Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.
2827211	2828393	Oh, we got to talk about that.
2828453	2830697	I got to go do a deep dive on this one, but go ahead.
2831386	2851470	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2852412	2854214	Would people be interested in that?
2854294	2861904	If you're going to buy a fight stick, wouldn't you rather get one that a lot of the other fighting game players use?
2862165	2864067	I don't know, because I'm expecting this to be expensive.
2864087	2867952	I mean, maybe, but that fight stick looked really good, Loki.
2869154	2871417	Like, I kind of listen to that.
2872207	2887228	I don't know.
2887208	2910060	and DarkSakura.com.
2910040	2930378	Digital Eclipse, Ninja Turtles, Gold Master Series
2930358	2935789	Bobby, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who's live before we are on Sunday nights, the Voice Geeks Network.
2935809	2941541	Bobby actually asked, so the head of Digital Eclipse is actually on Blue Sky and uses it.
2941561	2949717	Mike Mika is studio head for Digital Eclipse, Atari, and actually responded to a question Bobby asked that was basically like, what...
2949697	2952182	What made... Okay, so you're saying... I'm paraphrasing.
2952242	2961601	You're saying this isn't a gold master game, but it looks like it has a lot of that same stuff that Atari 50 had, which kind of felt very... What is a gold master game and what is not a gold master game?
2961642	2965309	And I'm paraphrasing the answer here, but essentially, the...
2965289	2971019	Game Collection are kind of a celebration of the game and they are game focused first.
2971460	2974926	Game emulation and the game experience is first.
2974946	2982019	And then they have sort of like the catalog of the deeper dives of the documentary pieces and the game elements and that is second.
2982620	2985846	Gold Master Series is the other way around.
2985826	2994537	The narrative takes the spotlight and the documentary side of things, which you really see it in the Tetris collection that they did recently.
2994557	2997100	You really see it in the Tetris one, in my opinion.
2997140	3004549	How they weave in the games into that story they're telling about getting the rights and how Japan had their own version on their Famicom.
3004569	3005410	We have one of those.
3005551	3008374	It really comes together with the story.
3008354	3021382	And the reason why I say that is because you might remember some time ago on this show, after we played the very first Gold Master Series game, Karateka, I said, the next one will probably be Mortal Kombat.
3021863	3028658	Because there's an interview with, I think it was Tobias, was in that Karateka, and I was like...
3028638	3031526	What he doesn't really have anything to do with Karateka.
3031987	3033832	He has a short little clip in this.
3033852	3040630	I think they were already filming him for something else and asked him to comment on Karateka because, you know, it was a fighting game.
3040650	3043457	So I said, Mortal Kombat, something's coming.
3043488	3045210	And sure enough, here we are.
3045230	3050456	Now, to be fair, I said it would be a gold master game and technically it's not, but I still want half a win.
3050476	3053319	But here's the other funny interaction on Blue Sky.
3053339	3058004	So I was writing a bunch of just fucking, you know, posts about what was going on with the Sony thing.
3058024	3061608	And I put one that said Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.
3061968	3067354	I did say when one of the creators showed up in Karateka Gold Series, it was likely Mortal Kombat was next.
3067675	3071719	I guess it's not technically a gold master, but it's getting the same TLC so close enough.
3072200	3073461	Must buy for me.
3074082	3081628	Mike Mika, who by the way, at the time I didn't even follow, replies to my post and says, we saw your post.
3086418	3106553	and DarkSakura.
3106533	3126685	You never know who's looking at stuff on social media.
3126665	3134134	But let this be a note to all of you that the game developers and the people that work on this stuff are watching.
3134154	3140182	So when you make your criticisms, which you have every right to do, keep that in mind in the back of your head.
3141223	3143786	Would you say this to the developer's face, yes or no?
3143806	3144667	Because you probably are.
3145368	3146650	You might be.
3146990	3148111	So I thought that was interesting.
3148152	3153398	But anyway, I love that he replied and I just replied, you slipped.
3153462	3154223	No, I said that.
3154243	3155525	I said you slipped.
3156086	3156847	And just kidding.
3156867	3159211	I think what you got, you know, the typical... And it's from the heart.
3159231	3159631	It's honest.
3160372	3161334	You guys are doing great stuff.
3161654	3163016	Love what you're doing for game preservation.
3163397	3167142	And if you ever want to do a podcast when Mortal Kombat's coming out, please let me know.
3167763	3169085	So, yeah.
3171028	3176336	SSJ100Matt says, Use your Rob Stradama's powers to get a Miyamoto Gold Master game before he retires.
3176356	3179240	I wish, but that's a big ask.
3179701	3181384	That's a big ask.
3181404	3182305	But...
3182521	3188167	You know, I'm not going to say it's not plausible, your favorite, but anyway.
3190609	3192211	Let's see.
3192611	3197997	Tigerclaw says, I still think it's going to include Deadly Alliance, Deception, and Armageddon, the console versions.
3198998	3199478	It might.
3199578	3203823	I mean, I guess they're not done announcing what's in it, but I would be careful where you set the bar.
3204243	3206966	I would be very careful where you set the bar.
3207787	3207887	Okay.
3207867	3209169	I'm not sure.
3209610	3215821	I would think maybe some of the weird hacks and things that came out of the original Mortal Kombat and some of that maybe is what you'll see.
3215901	3219307	But I don't know if we'll get full on other games.
3219808	3222913	I mean, could we get that whole Sub-Zero side story game on PlayStation 1?
3222933	3225117	I just don't know if that fits in.
3225097	3251222	regardless the first four arcade games by themselves with the deeper dive that Digital Eclipse does I think it's going to be worthy of the collection and I'm not just saying that because now I know they might be listening I would have said this even without the blue sky interaction this week so but I did think I did find that humorous so all right that's all I wanted to say on the Mortal Kombat collection um but very happy for Digital Eclipse and very happy for Mortal Kombat it deserves it deserves this nice sort of um museum treatment
3253042	3258445	and I'll be watching for what cameos don't make sense in that either, just so you know yep
3258577	3263886	We got yet another trailer for Melgar's Solid Delta Snake Eater.
3265568	3269475	They teased also Melgar Online at the end with that as well.
3270656	3278128	Nioh 3 is going to be getting its launch in 2026 and they have a demo out for that as well.
3279090	3284078	Thief VR Legacy of Shadow coming to PlayStation VR 2.
3284648	3290642	Tides of Tomorrow, I don't remember what that was.
3290926	3318283	but neat Astrobot getting some new levels so they've got some new challenge levels including special bots Atsu from Ghosts of Yotai and they also have five new levels which are going to be coming out later this month and they had another Astrobot DualSense controller or I don't know if they're bringing the old one back or if they changed it slightly but it's coming back one way or the other
3318500	3319523	Let's see.
3319583	3324820	Anchors Away, which kind of look like Sea of Thieves, but not quite.
3325603	3328372	But very Sea of Thieves-like.
3328412	3330940	So that's going to be coming next year.
3331190	3350835	Sword of the Sea which looks pretty cool as well that's going to be coming out August 19th that's from the makers of Journey and Flower and certainly has that kind of same vibe with the whole sand surfing type stuff those games are some of the best games ever made so I'm really excited for this
3351372	3353055	Yeah, yeah, it looks really good.
3353956	3360087	We got the first look at 007 First Light, the new 007 game by IO Interactive.
3361249	3363032	And, yeah, it is James Bond.
3365135	3366618	That's next year as well.
3367820	3374451	Ghost of Yotai, which is... They had a new teaser for that.
3374471	3375152	Um...
3375419	3393613	and then ending things off totally unexpected but I am super hyped about this game a brand new Marvel fighting game, Marvel Token Fighting Souls done by the folks, Arc System Works Marvel vs. Capcom minus Capcom plus Arc
3394538	3398463	Plus Japanese anime stylings and stuff.
3399063	3402347	That's all in plus arc if you've played Guilty Gear.
3402748	3404690	That is very true, yes.
3404790	3406312	But I am all about this.
3406492	3408154	It looks incredible.
3408474	3410096	The roster already looks good.
3410297	3412119	The character designs look amazing.
3412359	3414081	I'm all about this.
3414101	3414862	I cannot wait.
3415322	3417525	And that's PlayStation 5 and PC next year.
3417505	3440560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3440540	3457317	Capcom Auto Hookup for a fighting game is Sega
3458393	3459975	and I was like, huh.
3460816	3461697	That could be interesting.
3462559	3463420	It could be really interesting.
3464201	3466163	I liked that train of thought.
3466424	3469087	Who does Capcom shack up with now?
3469107	3478039	Because I was like, well that could be an interesting little like, could Capcom maybe be involved with the future of Smash?
3478019	3485031	and what happens there because I don't know if Sakurai wants to necessarily do Smash anymore.
3485492	3490220	So I feel like how we've seen... But that doesn't mean there's not going to be another Smash game.
3490961	3496751	But I sort of feel like how we're seeing some very different creative thoughts and processes go into Mario Kart World.
3497272	3501259	We're going to see some different thoughts and processes go into...
3501239	3501720	Smash.
3502060	3504764	I ultimately don't think the Capcom thing is just mostly tongue-in-cheek.
3504804	3506466	I actually don't think there's anything to that.
3506486	3511452	But I do think that maybe creatively, there's going to be a lot of changes with the next Smash.
3511953	3515478	Because if you want to play Smash the way you remember it, you have that game.
3515598	3516459	Everyone is here.
3517080	3520384	I feel like that's the capstone to Smash, looking like that.
3521005	3523348	And we'll see where it goes from here.
3523328	3551344	but it could be interesting if Capcom's like we want to give our input because some of our characters like Mega Man are in the game anyway so we'll see anyway anyways yes so like that trailer is amazing yeah I'm not even that into fighting games and that looked like wow this is I'm not that into Marvel either I respect both but I'm just not like but I was like oh I'll play that that was hot
3552083	3553545	Yeah, it looks really good.
3554606	3556989	That's a day one purchase for me, for sure.
3557850	3560373	So how did you feel about the Sony thing overall?
3560393	3561194	I thought it was pretty good.
3561355	3567823	I didn't have any expectations for it when it came in, but certainly there was some nice surprises in there.
3568404	3569465	Yeah, I think it's all right.
3569505	3570466	I think they did a really good job.
3570847	3579137	I think especially considering they're having to contend with a new console from one of their competitors launching the next day and Microsoft doing their own thing today.
3580906	3581707	Yeah, yeah.
3582668	3604433	Yeah.
3604413	3609640	And cheap plug, we did a live stream here at VOG Network on Friday, and that'll be in the archives for 14 days.
3609700	3615028	Unfortunately, we no longer keep archives beyond 14 days because Twitch capped us, as they did everybody.
3615048	3618973	So you have about another week to watch if you want.
3619114	3624441	But I understand the show itself wasn't for everybody.
3624461	3627906	I really feel like there's something in it for you.
3628122	3637660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3638872	3643278	Yeah, so kind of going over how they announced stuff over there.
3643418	3651489	So essentially, they made a big focus about dev team size, it felt like.
3651509	3654753	They were talking about, you know, different indie games.
3654894	3667090	You know, the top games on Steam right now included like several indies, including, you know, Repo, Claire Obscure, Expedition 33, Split Fiction, that type of stuff.
3667070	3671100	I was trying to figure out, what was the endgame with those comments?
3671781	3675590	What was the intention behind repeating that so much?
3675731	3682286	Was it a veiled sort of poke at something like Ubisoft or the AAA games?
3682406	3684792	Maybe, yeah.
3684772	3709125	or was it more like a it's going to be okay game devs we've got all these small studios doing great things although there have been a lot of rightful points that have come out after the fact going okay so Clare Obscure was made by a team of 30 on paper but you have a lot of groups that do outsource work what about the voice actors what about the music what about you know and so when you look at the credits for a game there are more than 30 people in it
3709105	3710747	Yeah.
3711047	3733813	Yeah.
3734468	3745329	I think it may have also been just pushing to... He was also promoting GameDiscover.co as well, that site.
3745830	3747513	Talking about the game industry and stuff.
3747633	3748114	I don't know.
3748735	3756831	But I think maybe it was just like, hey, AAA industry, the way you guys are operating and everything...
3757115	3757696	It's not working.
3758577	3775105	You're putting out these games, but this cookie cutter stuff that you're doing, but these smaller games that are taking unique approaches to things or just listening to their fan base and putting out stuff that there's a hole in the market for it, they're doing well.
3775125	3783679	Whereas Team Shooter number 457 that's released out on the marketplace...
3783862	3785204	Yeah, that's not doing as well.
3785345	3791876	I do think there's a message in there about how the way games are developed is going to really change.
3792518	3796625	And engines like Unreal 5 are kind of doing that.
3796645	3800933	And for better or for worse, AI is going to be a part of this conversation as well.
3800953	3802716	It's going to be whether you like it or not.
3802736	3805060	And certainly you all know I have my opinions on it.
3805040	3808605	I like AI in tool-based situations.
3808625	3812531	I dislike AI in trying to replace art with generative stuff type of situations.
3812712	3820944	By the way, that Jurassic World 3 game has an AI warning on Steam that the little user avatars are generated by AI.
3821024	3821365	Why?
3822266	3822607	Why?
3823448	3824770	Anyway.
3825222	3825663	Oh, no.
3825703	3849778	Oh, no.
3849758	3855185	It becomes more like smaller groups working together as one large group.
3855746	3858850	But the advantage of that, I'm not saying I'm advocating for that.
3858890	3861374	I'm just wondering out loud if that's where things are going.
3861894	3875052	Because I will say the one advantage I do see in that situation, you don't have the potential for as much fat sack CEOs to be sitting on the top of this and ruining everything.
3877295	3879478	Anyway, just something interesting.
3881213	3885398	Alright, but yeah, game reveals, obviously, were the name of the game.
3885839	3903861	So they kicked things off with a trailer for Mortal Shell 2, which features one of the several genres that were in the Summer Game Fest presentation, which was a Dark Souls-like game that is bloody and creepy.
3903881	3908066	And so that definitely fit the bill for that.
3908166	3910849	That is coming out next year.
3910829	3916477	They also talked about some sort of, what was it, they had Death Stranding 2.
3916858	3920783	They showed off a new cutscene for that as well.
3922005	3926071	I am getting kind of tired of seeing Death Stranding 2 at this point, but it does look good.
3927252	3931318	It is getting to that point where it's like, enough, release the damn game.
3931358	3934643	But the good news is, the damn game's being released in like two weeks, so yay.
3935213	3936715	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3936815	3945905	Then we have a Chronicles Medieval trailer narrated by Tom Hardy, maybe, or at least someone that sounds like Tom Hardy.
3946706	3948749	That's coming out on Steam in 2026.
3948869	3950210	It looks pretty cool.
3951011	3953294	This one really was something I got excited about.
3953674	3955276	So, Sonic Racing Cross Worlds.
3955296	3960242	The Sonic Racing games have been always pretty good, and this time they have...
3960222	3979783	Thank you for watching!
3979763	4005687	and then they unveiled because the game is called Cross Worlds that they're going to be essentially having characters from other franchises and levels in there and one of their first collaborations is with Minecraft so they're going to have Steve Alex and the Creeper as characters and a Minecraft actual level I heard the rumor that there is Spongebob is supposed to be another crossover that they're going to have
4005667	4027793	They had a bunch, yes.
4027773	4050422	so you know and that's that's i could that's a hard one to make up and get right you know what i mean yeah i could see the nickelodeon thing because that makes sense because if you think about sonic the movie was produced by paramount paramount owns nickelodeon okay okay i can see that you know what else is on paramount plus rupaul's drag race
4051634	4080190	could we finally oh my god you have race you have race to the title that's right could we get RuPaul's Drag Race but it's actual racing oh my god please let Jujubee be one of the playable characters why not it's Jujubee again why not Jujubee and Ginger Minj should absolutely be in Sonic Crossworld Racing why not Crossdressing Racing yeah let's do it let's do it Crossdressing Racing
4080170	4096660	uh Crossworld there you go that that sounds like a RuPaul Drag Race season right there like Crossworld I mean yeah they're gonna run out of twist ideas for all stars eventually so we might as well go to Cross Crossworld and there you go uh let's see
4098209	4100534	We had a bunch of trailers.
4100554	4104062	So Code Vein 2 had a reveal trailer.
4104343	4105445	Looks pretty awesome.
4105465	4106608	That's coming out later this year.
4107510	4117753	End of the Abyss, a top-down isometric-looking game, and that's by Epic Games as well as Section 9 Interactive.
4117733	4140433	and we had a new updated trailer for Mouse PI for Hire this is the one that looks like the old 1920s cartoons but it's an FPS and of course because he voices almost every character in the world when it comes to gaming Troy Baker is going to be doing the main character voice as well so
4142405	4146230	Game of Thrones War of Westeros looks pretty awesome.
4146251	4150877	It feels like a few years too late, but it looks neat.
4151818	4154542	Atomic Heart 2, I'm actually pretty psyched for.
4154602	4157827	It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to the original game.
4158568	4161352	Certainly kind of expands upon everything.
4161372	4166860	They are horny as fuck, though, when it comes to the content in that game.
4166840	4172794	Uh, tying with that, though, is also the cube in the Atomic Universe.
4172954	4173837	Oh, yeah, that MMO.
4173857	4175180	It's an MMORPG shooter.
4175400	4180392	That rotating cube thing looked kind of neat, though, like as a concept about how the world could kind of, like, rotate and stuff.
4180472	4181254	Yeah, I like the idea.
4181274	4182537	That's an interesting concept, yeah.
4183799	4185861	So that'll be coming out at some point.
4187403	4194691	Then we got a brand new trailer for Marvel Cosmic Invasion by Tribute.
4195071	4196012	Looks awesome.
4196253	4200297	They're adding Rocket Raccoon and She-Hulk joining the cast as well.
4200697	4202459	I honestly love everything Tribute does.
4202499	4203621	I love their beat-em-up games.
4203941	4204982	It's going to be great.
4205082	4209167	It's got the big X-Men 90s beat-em-up, Ninja Turtles arcade game, Simpsons arcade.
4209187	4210248	It's got that same vibe.
4210268	4213131	So if you're into that, this is going to be for you for sure.
4213617	4230715	Onimusha, Way of the Sword looks pretty cool and that's going to be coming out next year I was really excited about this one because it's just such a unique idea but felt that boxing it's a boxing game with puppets
4230695	4235401	But it looks like I'm watching The Muppet Show or something like that because it's so well executed.
4235421	4236242	It was very X-rated, though.
4236262	4237383	It was very X-rated.
4237423	4238284	They were cursing.
4238404	4242229	Yeah, it was Meet the Feebles as the arcade game.
4243471	4246134	No, that was one of the highlights of the whole damn thing for me.
4246494	4253563	Although I'm not sure what the game is because I gotta say the game kind of was starting to look like... Is this like a 3DO...
4254573	4266789	Like little mini game game because I just I really hope the game itself is better than that or it's really funny to make up for it because I wasn't I was like, what's the game here?
4266829	4268093	Because I have concerns.
4270148	4271610	I don't know, it looks funny.
4271630	4275335	So I'm willing to check it out when that is released.
4275375	4276696	We had Killer Inn.
4277457	4279660	It's a murder mystery action game.
4280061	4281843	Oh, this looks really cool.
4281863	4292596	That was the one that's like Among Us, but it's like Clue or Knives Out, but with like actual murder instead of like playing Clue, but like you full on are killing the other characters.
4293237	4296742	It's not just like implied or suggested or something like that.
4296762	4298704	Yeah, 24 player game.
4298684	4299886	That looked fun.
4300046	4305575	I got an email from Square Enix after for a beta test or something.
4305695	4307258	Maybe I'm not supposed to say that.
4307919	4309321	I'm into that.
4309661	4310182	I'll check it out.
4310363	4315090	I figure all the Final Fantasy subscribers got one so that's why I'm yapping.
4315357	4317421	New trailer for Ark Raiders.
4317521	4318543	It's their release trailer.
4318664	4320848	It's going to be coming out October 30th.
4321169	4326619	And apparently that's been doing pretty well in their early tests that they did earlier this year.
4327601	4330086	Dune Awakening got a new trailer as well.
4330848	4332471	That looked pretty good.
4332451	4350841	Chrono Odyssey Not to be confused with Chrono Trigger or Cross Completely different And so that's going to be coming out on Steam The playtest is coming out in a few weeks We had M.I.O.
4350861	4355809	Memories in Orbit They announced a demo for that
4355890	4379940	Outworlds looked pretty cool this one is done in the style of like stop motion and so it looks a little bit like a Coraline or something like that but I kind of got that whole split fiction or takes two vibes with that the controls look like VVVVV where you were like flipping gravity that's what the gameplay was looking like to me yeah yeah
4380089	4381412	Yeah.
4381632	4383055	Mafia The Old Country.
4383275	4386682	I got a new trailer for that that's coming out in August on the 8th.
4388386	4391312	Sorry, I just never get into Mafia.
4391792	4392494	No offense.
4392694	4394778	Look, you can't love everything.
4395059	4395861	No disrespect.
4396061	4396562	Sorry.
4397572	4406205	We had LEGO Voyagers, which is kind of a... Also, once again, like a split fiction or something like that.
4406766	4408108	That looked really interesting.
4408449	4413416	Yeah, little bricks and you kind of... The graphics were very shiny in that game.
4413516	4415179	It looked very crisp.
4415259	4420948	It's very much like... I don't remember the last LEGO puzzle game that they had, but similar to that.
4421148	4425655	I mean, Unreal 5 makes everything look just amazing, so...
4425635	4431265	They really do look like real physical, tangible bricks.
4431285	4432908	Looks pretty cool.
4432928	4434652	This sounds like a lot of fun.
4434712	4437918	Nicktoons and the Dice of Destiny.
4437938	4440903	It's a Nicktoons D&D-like adventure.
4440923	4443087	Oh yeah, it had Diablo vibes to me.
4443067	4445012	Yeah, Nicktoons Diablo.
4445272	4447217	I mean, that sounds like a lot of fun to me.
4447237	4451447	Some were thinking it was Baldur's Gate, Nickelodeon, which I think is also a great idea.
4451467	4454354	So I'm not sure exactly how it plays, if it's more actiony or more RPG-ish.
4454394	4456198	It looked actiony to me, but we'll see.
4457292	4460657	Yeah, it looks a little bit like Minecraft Dungeon-y, almost.
4460977	4463441	So, curious to check that out.
4464463	4469550	Liza P. Overture, I believe that's, yeah, DLC that came out today!
4469610	4471233	Shadow Drop, yeah.
4471253	4471974	A couple days ago.
4473076	4474137	So that's pretty cool.
4475159	4481628	Fractured Blooms, that was like a weird Silent Hill-looking type of game.
4481829	4482810	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
4483398	4488185	Blade and Soul Neo and Blade and Soul Heroes.
4489667	4493453	I guess it's expansions to their ongoing MMOs.
4494515	4497219	Then of course Jurassic World Evolution 3.
4498781	4503448	So they had Jeff Goldblum doing the voiceover on that.
4504559	4506201	Yeah, I'm not really sure much.
4506341	4508705	I haven't really played any of the Jurassic World games.
4508725	4514353	They gave one of them away during, like, it was either an Epic Free Game of the Week or a PlayStation something.
4515454	4517737	But it's honestly just been sitting in my backlog.
4518118	4520702	In concept, it sounds really good.
4520882	4523125	I'm a little put off by...
4523847	4526772	This whole AI thing that apparently is in the third game.
4526932	4541414	I would like to have more information to make an informed decision, but if they are just using generative AI to make art that looks silly, it's going to ruin the experience, sorry to say.
4541534	4547624	And you think they would have learned from... I can't even remember the game now.
4547644	4550428	The game was Splatoon, but with bubbles.
4551775	4553057	Oh, Foam Stars.
4553077	4553518	Foam Stars.
4553538	4554079	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4554099	4554860	That's it.
4554880	4556002	You think they would have learned from that?
4556723	4560830	Because that game honestly wasn't bad.
4560851	4569505	But they really sucked the air out of the room by taking one shortcut, they really could have just not had album art.
4569525	4570527	It's easy, anyway.
4571587	4577379	We had Mina the Hollower, which is a new game from Yacht Club Games.
4577960	4582008	Looked a lot like a Legend of Zelda type of game.
4582028	4583912	Definitely had NES vibes.
4584332	4588080	Yeah, it had like NES or Game Boy Color vibes on that.
4588100	4590625	So that's going to be coming out October 31st.
4591195	4592616	Deadpool VR.
4592837	4596560	I'm very excited about that, except I don't have a MetaQuest 3, so I can't really play that.
4596580	4599703	Another VR game that got me excited, except it's the wrong VR.
4600544	4601244	Yeah, yeah.
4601264	4604868	Neil Patrick Harris is playing Wade Wilson, so that sounds awesome.
4604888	4605709	That'll look great.
4606169	4607270	That trailer was very sharp.
4607670	4607891	Yeah.
4608191	4609352	Yeah, it looks cool.
4610213	4618080	Dying Light is getting a spinoff game, Dying Light the Beast, and that is coming out August 22nd.
4618465	4624818	Um, we had, uh, Living in the 90s, The Game, or Mixtape.
4624838	4626180	It's a new game by Annapurna.
4627222	4628765	And... Oh, God.
4629326	4630689	All those references.
4631290	4632793	It was definitely made for people our age.
4634577	4635779	Yeah, I'm gonna have to get it.
4636320	4636501	Yeah.
4636521	4636962	Unfortunately.
4637162	4637723	I like that.
4637888	4645967	Then we had Toa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, or basically Buff Corgi Monk and Distinguished Fish.
4645987	4650036	Yes, that game looked cool, because that was also kind of a Diablo-y looking game, if I'm not mistaken.
4650057	4655830	The character design was really neat, and then they were saying it was inspired by...
4655810	4668163	I don't want to misattribute it, but it seems like there's more to it than just coming up with creative characters that is actually inspired by art and other things in the past history.
4668243	4670846	So I'm very curious about that game.
4670866	4671306	It looked neat.
4673729	4677613	We had another game called Acts of Blood, which is like a beat-em-up game.
4679014	4680516	Looked kind of interesting.
4681717	4681817	Yeah.
4682540	4705864	but speaking of beat-em-up games though right after that they uh showed off a trailer for Scott Pilgrim EX yeah wow that was a very pleasant exciting yeah it's exciting as we got you know it's Anamona Gucci back with Tribute Games again uh a different story right a new story a brand new story four-player co-op uh I think it was like seven characters or something like that
4705844	4729017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4729132	4729873	It looks awesome.
4731095	4735082	We have the first Descendants breakthrough.
4735864	4737426	There's a trailer for that.
4737447	4739791	I don't even remember what this was.
4740171	4745661	Oh, yeah, it's some sort of mech-y combat thing.
4745721	4750289	Not to be confused with the Disney Descendants.
4750309	4753755	No, definitely not related at all.
4754022	4757568	Yeah, I would say that's... Here's a deep cut here.
4758490	4767686	Yeah, the first Descendants has enough to do with the Descendants from Disney as did the Final Fantasy Legend of the... Was it Legend of the Crystals?
4768748	4770671	The movie had to do with Final Fantasy.
4772354	4774478	That's basically how close those were.
4775403	4798862	Scum, it's Rust Plus, essentially It's crass humor, the game Oh, that trailer was a hot mess, but yes There were butts in that trailer So that's how you know it's edgy There's so many butts Yet still not the edgiest thing that was at Summer Game Fest
4799787	4818285	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4818265	4845285	Hitman, World of Assassins or Assassination we got the Madden Mickelson cameo or uh he's playing um Leigh Shreve I guess from Casino Royale because you know obviously IO Interactive is making the the Bond game so they're gonna obviously do some sort of Bond kind of tie in with that for a little bit so you can check that out now um and then the most obvious thing or um
4846497	4859173	Legally Distinct Mario Party Lego Party It's Mario Party but with Lego and on more than just Nintendo systems So that's coming out later this year It actually looks kind of fun
4859575	4862041	Uh, then we've got, what was it?
4862182	4862964	Wild Gate.
4863144	4868197	Sorry, I was, I was ranting and I was muted, but, um, it, I was gonna say for Legally Distinct, it looked really good.
4868799	4872689	Uh, and I'm kind of excited for Mario to get a little, little run for its money.
4872729	4875316	You know, the, the little competition will be good.
4875336	4876639	I think the Lego thing looked cool.
4877412	4896450	Wildgate announced an open beta which is going to be actually out during Steam Next Fest which is launching on July 24th It's like a space warfare game Blighted, that's another roguelike game that's going to be out on Steam as well
4896430	4908446	We had a thing called Ill, which is going back to the very first game we talked about in that gross, nasty, creepy-looking survivor horror game in Unreal 5.
4910389	4911690	But yeah, that looks kind of cool.
4912812	4915095	Mecha Break got yet another trailer.
4915596	4916136	Cool.
4916477	4918439	At least it's coming out July 1st.
4919100	4923366	Once again, I'm also starting to get tired of seeing Mecha Break as well.
4925641	4927305	and Infantessimals.
4927325	4935123	It's a very grounded looking game where you play little bug-like creatures and you fight in mechs and big bugs and stuff like that.
4935223	4935985	It looked kind of neat.
4937629	4940776	Then we had the whole tease before the tease.
4940797	4944004	So they did this thing with the...
4943984	4972422	Resident Evil 30th Anniversary teaser and they talked about how like oh look we're doing this stuff and don't worry we'll talk about Resident Evil the next Resident Evil soon later on you know what the fuck was the point of that like what the fuck was the point of that I don't my my thought my honest reaction is that the ultimate Resident Evil announcement was a very late edition like they were going into that with like 50 50 yes or no we're gonna pull the trigger on this thing
4972402	5000991	so I think they may be left in the commercial anyway just because somebody thought it was funny at that point to keep it in but like maybe what was the point of that I don't understand I don't know it's just a trick people like I get I get the trolling element look it's not lost on me it's it's cute whatever but I just was like Capcom you spent money on that ad that was that was an interesting play but okay okay sure it's your money spend it how you want
5001443	5007210	We had a little LOL, but it was LOL in lowercase, where you weren't really laughing out loud.
5007250	5010114	You were... You were just making a little breath.
5010134	5012216	You were making a snort.
5012417	5013298	You snorted out loud.
5013318	5014099	You weren't laughing out loud.
5015621	5018785	It would be GTM, guffaw to myself.
5018845	5020587	Yes, that's it.
5020607	5021388	Yes, perfect.
5021728	5023190	Oh my god, perfect, perfect.
5023210	5028477	That was not an LOL, it was a GTM.
5028597	5029678	Now I'm LOLing.
5030485	5056189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5056169	5061055	Yeah, or Mortal Kombat, I guess.
5061115	5063818	That's kind of, yeah.
5063838	5076713	Then we got Last Flag, which is supposed to be like a 1970s retro team shooter capture the flag game, which I couldn't help but just think it looks exactly like Team Fortress 2.
5076913	5077874	Like, exactly.
5078034	5079096	Like, the classes even.
5079136	5080577	They have a scout class even.
5080657	5081198	It's like...
5082292	5104266	Wuchang Fallen Feathers Rise of the Deceiver
5105073	5107055	Unexpected, but great.
5107135	5108377	Co-op action RPG game.
5108537	5110379	They didn't show much of it though.
5110500	5111561	It was a little tease.
5112001	5113263	No.
5113323	5119190	Then we had another weird looking game, kind of had some Conker vibes on it, but Into the Unwell.
5121613	5131705	It sort of looked a little bit like Maus as well, but just kind of has that retro cartoon style to it, but also a little bit twisted and weird.
5132410	5155093	Then we got to the next announcement, which we had the dev for, I don't remember which studio, but he was promoting Splitgate 2, and it's that combat game with portals in it.
5155073	5160043	He came out with a stupid hat saying, make FPS great again.
5160484	5162929	And said, I want Titanfall 3.
5163330	5167779	And then proceeded to show a game that looked very bland and bog standard.
5168000	5168761	That's it.
5168882	5170585	The game's getting a new Battle Royale mode.
5170565	5171206	That's it.
5171226	5171846	Nailhead.
5172007	5176832	Look, you made a choice, young man, to come out there on stage and be edgy.
5177252	5187463	You said, I'm going to be edgy McEdgelord today, and I'm going to say these things so I either get invited back or I can pout that I don't get invited back next time.
5188164	5193810	And I'm going to say these edgy, edgy things and talk about how fucking great this game is and how, you know, da-da-da.
5193830	5200437	And then you prepare to roll the scissor wheel on a game we've seen a million fucking times with portals.
5201783	5204146	You made a choice, sir.
5204166	5205048	You made a choice.
5206229	5206530	Hold on.
5207010	5208993	And it's all these fucking dog whistles, too.
5209033	5210315	And you know exactly what I'm talking about.
5210335	5211537	You know exactly what I'm talking about.
5211937	5215362	All these fucking dog whistles and what he was saying, too, let alone the hat that he was wearing.
5215382	5217906	Like, I literally had to go, is this parody?
5218446	5224415	Is this a joke that is going on and what's happening here?
5224435	5226017	Yeah, Ranma says it was parodies.
5226458	5227700	Did you listen to what he said, though?
5228100	5230704	Because there's a lot of what he was saying that was very coded.
5230744	5231605	That's what they're always saying.
5231585	5233007	Look, here's the thing.
5233307	5240176	You made a choice to turn off what could have been a crowd that maybe would have taken interest in your free-to-play game otherwise.
5240717	5246945	And now you're going all in on the other half, which, fine, maybe that'll work out for you.
5246985	5250830	Maybe it'll help your free-to-play game get noticed, where a lot of them don't get noticed.
5250850	5252132	Maybe it'll help get noticed.
5252152	5256377	But just remember, it's also the crowd of some of the...
5256644	5278838	DarkSakura.com
5279206	5286660	Now I want to bring up the whole parody argument because we hear that a lot nowadays, especially in, or like, I was just joking, I was trolling.
5287001	5297321	You know, like, we hear that a lot even in the political landscape when someone says something controversial or something to the point it's like, no human should be saying that type of thing.
5297942	5298042	Look,
5298241	5307295	Look, when you have the attention of millions of people in a press thing like this, and you're going to make a joke, you better make damn sure it's funny.
5307475	5308297	That's all I have to say.
5308597	5309258	Think about it.
5309298	5313385	It doesn't matter if you're joking or doing a parody.
5313405	5315368	Why did you have to do that in the first place?
5315408	5318032	This is just a show where you showcase your game.
5318272	5320716	You don't need to go, look at me, I'm a character.
5321357	5325784	I don't know who you are, and I am literally not going to be thinking about you ever again.
5325764	5327847	Aside from the stupid things that you did.
5327927	5333697	So, like, why, like, why take the focus off of your game?
5333717	5336661	Yeah, why not talk about what makes your game different?
5336701	5338244	What makes your game special?
5338384	5339806	Why should I check out your game?
5341088	5347899	But I think my favorite comment, though, and I don't remember who, somewhere on social media I saw where they compared it.
5348240	5350363	They're like, he's a pizza cutter.
5350804	5352767	All edge, no point.
5353777	5358106	That being said, no further discussion on that game is going to be on this program.
5358246	5358807	So let's move on.
5358827	5363597	Because I do, and yeah, to Ranma's point on chat, he got the spotlight on his company to get people to talk.
5363637	5363978	It worked.
5364138	5364519	You're right.
5364740	5366343	We shouldn't be giving this any more exposure.
5366363	5366824	Next.
5367901	5371267	It's the same studio.
5373451	5388660	It's the same studio, yeah.
5390041	5391323	So, looks great.
5393085	5410891	And then, oh my god, shock, because they told us, wait, you told us you weren't going to discuss this game, and then, boom, Resident Evil Requiem, Resident Evil 9, it's coming out February 27th, unless it gets delayed, because, you know, games be doing that.
5410911	5412133	But the trailer did look good.
5412113	5419004	It took a minute to figure out what it was, and then you saw the ruined Raccoon City Police Department.
5419044	5420867	It's like, oh, this is Resident Evil.
5422850	5423511	So that was it.
5423571	5424893	That was a lot.
5425174	5426576	Yeah, they crammed a lot into two hours.
5427918	5429020	Certainly.
5429040	5433447	But again, I kind of look back on the things that I was into, and there was...
5433764	5456717	XBOX did their showcase!
5457608	5459911	So we had a lot of things shown off.
5460371	5465758	One of the big ones, obviously, is The Outer Worlds 2, which is coming out October 29th.
5466880	5468141	And it looks pretty great.
5468221	5479976	It's going to also, they're going to be, since the launch is going to be, I don't know, it's day and date on PlayStation 5 as well.
5480236	5483380	It is also their first $80 game.
5484963	5486285	So I'll take that as well.
5486465	5487727	It looks pretty good, though.
5489389	5491011	But is $8 good?
5491191	5491772	I don't know.
5491792	5492112	We'll see.
5492353	5492693	We'll see.
5493634	5496378	We had a trailer for Haya on Life 2.
5497419	5500523	So definitely a little bit more sci-fi.
5500784	5503567	Your character, of course, was like skateboarding around in this one.
5504328	5505250	Looks really cool.
5506291	5510076	And so that will be coming out sometime in the near future.
5510798	5518648	We had Resonance A Plague Tale Legacy They revealed that, that's coming out next year
5519506	5521609	and... what else?
5522270	5528200	Then we got the announcement of the ROG Xbox Ally and... Ally!
5529662	5532406	Yeah, it's... Just in time for Pride Month.
5532507	5533128	Ally!
5533188	5536994	Portable PC, you know, like a Steam Deck type thing.
5537034	5539878	I mean, the ROG Ally's been a thing for a while now.
5539898	5541921	Now they're doing one that's Xbox-branded.
5541941	5544546	Literally that leak we talked about two weeks ago was it.
5544886	5546869	Like, we got confirmation.
5547050	5547370	Yeah.
5548295	5561477	so that's no price is announced yet but it's getting powered by why would they announce a price but aren't you supposed to announce a price Loki why would you not announce a price
5562014	5562595	I don't know.
5563096	5565419	I guess we'll see what it's going to be.
5566320	5572549	It's a pretty big competitive space right now with all the different Steam decks and stuff.
5572649	5573911	I think it's a neat idea.
5573931	5578057	I don't think I have room for another handheld, but it's not like I don't support Microsoft in other ways.
5578738	5580360	I think this will be neat for a certain audience.
5580340	5596223	Yeah, it's just a PC, so what's great about it, though, and one of the things that they, you know, touted, I mean, which is true for any PC, but it's like, hey, you know, you can play your Xbox games out here, but you're not just limited to that, you know, you also can get stuff from Steam, you can get stuff from good old games and all that stuff, which is like...
5597502	5599746	You can run your emulators from desktop.
5599766	5601028	You can run your emulators.
5601068	5603973	You can play Nintendo Switch games on this thing.
5604013	5608842	You can download PlayStation games because they're on PC as well.
5610184	5612027	I'd love to see that ad.
5612528	5615774	Xbox just says fuck it to the legal stuff.
5615794	5618278	Anyway, obviously that's not happening.
5618748	5622074	We had Blood of the Dawnwalker.
5622435	5625381	It's another RPG game.
5625601	5630330	It's done by XCD Project Red Devs who formed the Rebel Wolves.
5630350	5632234	And it looks kind of cool.
5633294	5635538	We had, uh, this one looked really neat.
5635798	5638463	So, Super Meat Boy 3D.
5638683	5642169	So they're doing a sequel, but it is, you know, it's a 3D platformer now.
5642630	5646817	Still all the same Meat Boy stuff, you know, lots of blood, lots of saws.
5647218	5648540	Hard as hell, for sure.
5649061	5650904	Yeah, so, uh, looks cool.
5650964	5653108	Can't wait to see speedruns on that.
5653088	5655210	Ninja Gaiden 4 got a new trailer.
5655931	5660114	So that's going to be coming out here in the near future as well.
5660134	5662136	Different from the Ninja Gaiden game at Sony.
5662156	5664098	So Sony's was the retro flared one.
5664158	5665059	This is the retro one.
5665459	5667281	You know, the modern take on Ninja Gaiden.
5667301	5667521	Yeah.
5668062	5668382	Yeah.
5668802	5673307	Then we got the announcement of story DLC coming to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.
5673487	5678451	So the Order of the Giants, which is coming out September 4th.
5678952	5681374	And that looks pretty awesome.
5681742	5695549	and let's see we've got Beast Reincarnation which is by Game Freak and it's a Souls-like game that's coming out next year it's kind of interesting
5696474	5726312	Clockwork Revolution Grounded 2 Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Again
5726967	5728028	Honey, it blew up the kids.
5729630	5730751	Honey, we shrunk ourselves.
5731191	5732132	Oh, that's right.
5732172	5733713	It was Honey, we shrunk ourselves.
5733733	5735375	Okay.
5735395	5735495	Yeah.
5735515	5736456	Yeah.
5736476	5738278	So, yeah, looks cool.
5738298	5740520	And they've got new bugs and stuff in that.
5740780	5743763	That's going to be hitting early access July 29th.
5744063	5745064	That's soon.
5745344	5749288	I feel like, I guess, I felt like Grounded was still being worked on.
5749308	5753032	But to be fair, I played that like a little bit when it was first on Game Pass, then never again.
5753112	5755094	So, but yeah, it's a cute game.
5755154	5756535	So I'll be curious about it.
5756870	5764984	Blooper Team is back with a new horror game, Kronos the New Dawn, which is going to be arriving next year.
5765605	5767429	And it's like a space horror game.
5767449	5768310	That looks kind of cool.
5768470	5770354	Well, they're having a good year with Silent Hill.
5770374	5776144	I mean, I know a lot of their stuff hit kind of mediocre, but the Silent Hill 2 remake hit all the right notes, so.
5777086	5790113	We have an announcement of another expansion to Elder Scrolls Online with Elder Scrolls Online Seasons of the Worm Cult Part 1 which is going to be launching in about a week.
5790133	5791777	And no more Elder Scrolls for you.
5792518	5794302	Please stay tuned for next year.
5794282	5805614	By the way, very important correction from DJ Ranma S in chat, our Rick Moranis expert, clearly, who says, I blew up The Kid was the second movie, and We Shrunk Ourselves was the third film.
5806154	5810799	Because there's a whole Honey, We Shrunk the Universe.
5810819	5816785	There's a whole... I'm almost positive there was a fourth film at some point, too, that Rick Moranis had nothing to do with.
5817426	5818247	So...
5818801	5820505	You know they're up to like five.
5821067	5821388	No, no, no.
5821709	5822390	I'm joking.
5822410	5824416	Like a universe of those movies.
5824436	5825398	Oh, yeah.
5825438	5828747	You know there's like five Home Alone movies at this point, right?
5828767	5830913	Yeah, they don't count.
5831354	5831895	That's right.
5831915	5833439	There was a TV series.
5833459	5834903	That's what it was.
5835068	5836950	It was a TV series they had for that whole thing.
5837912	5844159	Yes, and then there was the, oh, I'm well aware of the Disney ride, Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which was terrible.
5844320	5845721	I was terrible.
5845742	5846242	I'm sorry.
5847123	5848966	It was neat.
5849526	5852830	Not everybody agrees with my hot takes sometimes, and that's fine.
5852850	5856435	If that's something you want to ride, I'll be in queue for Space Mountain again.
5859233	5863779	Well, I mean, if I am with Captain Neo, Captain Neo was way better, way better.
5864079	5864560	True.
5864720	5866963	Yes, yes, yes.
5867844	5870928	I remember it was the cutting edge thing with the shrug.
5870968	5876035	The audience was like, we're going to blow air at you and like we're going to make a little rat tail spin around.
5876095	5878658	So it feels like rats are running underneath your seat.
5879199	5880280	Yeah, it was silly, but.
5881137	5885144	By the way, on that note, RIP Muppet Vision 3D, officially.
5885846	5894441	The Disney California Adventure one closed years ago, but the Disney World attraction finally officially closed this last week.
5894802	5897527	Are they making Avatar out of that, too?
5897647	5897928	I don't know.
5897948	5898970	It's being turned into something else.
5899511	5901955	Muppet will be relocated to the Aerosmith, right?
5901975	5904580	Aerosmith is being evicted from Disneyland, which, you know...
5904560	5910748	and they are going to make that rock and roller coaster, the Doctor Mayhem ride, which will be badass.
5910788	5913652	That I'm excited about, but RIP to Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.
5915935	5917016	Okay.
5917036	5919560	They even had a game called, was that Felion?
5920300	5925187	Which is a narrative-driven sci-fi adventure game by DotNod.
5925227	5931715	It reminded me of like a Tomb Raider, but in space on a desolate planet.
5932897	5932997	Okay.
5933686	5938091	Whoever this space person is, it is their very bad day.
5938111	5939012	That's what's going to happen.
5939313	5940033	A lot of space games.
5941215	5941435	Yep.
5942496	5948443	We had a weird looking game called There Are No Ghosts at the Grand.
5949524	5955011	And it's like some thing where you are an interior decorator who also hunts ghosts.
5955351	5956533	It's like a cozy sim thing.
5957153	5959156	And you vacuum up ghosts just like Luigi.
5959176	5960878	So, kind of neat.
5961739	5962039	Um...
5963302	5969649	Age of Mythology Retold is getting a Heavenly Sphere.
5969789	5975136	It was a Japanese pantheon to the game.
5975176	5980522	That era is now coming with 12 new mission campaigns.
5981463	5982924	Yeah, 12 mission campaigns.
5983605	5983886	Neat.
5985307	5985628	What else?
5986509	5990013	Mundang Two Hearts, which looks just like Splinter Cell.
5990733	5992195	That's going to be...
5992833	5997202	using Unreal 5 and no word on when that's coming out.
5998946	6005059	Then Planet of Lana 2 looks gorgeous with the little kitty thing.
6005280	6006964	I don't know if it's a cat, but it looks like a cat.
6007926	6009930	And it's like a 2D cinematic game.
6011632	6016007	Fallout 76 getting a fishing DLC.
6016027	6018916	Kind of surprised they're still cranking out stuff for Fallout 76.
6018936	6020923	Yeah, it's probably making money.
6021364	6022047	Gone Fission.
6022087	6024595	I do know people that play it.
6024980	6025902	Love the pun, yeah.
6025922	6028889	So fishing, you get fishing rods and fishing in the game.
6029791	6030753	I wouldn't eat those fish.
6030873	6033679	You know, that TV show probably brought more people to it, too.
6033839	6035022	So I guess, you know.
6035864	6042659	Yeah, and Fallout 76 has also been given away for free a few times.
6042679	6045064	That's kind of another one of those games that had a comeback story.
6046090	6070545	yeah uh we have uh let's see solo leveling um they have Arise Overlord or Overdrive so they're showing that off and that's going to be an action RPG I think co-op RPG and that's coming later this year on PC and Xbox or I'm sorry later this year on PC Xbox next year um
6071740	6077990	Then we have Animo, which is like, it looks like a Pal World type game, but it's not.
6078190	6080354	It's another one, another game.
6080394	6082597	Even more legally distinct, yeah.
6082617	6089668	Yes, but you, yes, but you, like, it looks like you transform into the animals and actually directly control them, which is kind of neat.
6090870	6091090	Okay.
6091130	6093394	That's how they get, that's how they make it legally distinct.
6093965	6095347	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
6095367	6101919	Then we got another look at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, which is out July 11th, but they put out a demo for it.
6101939	6103722	I was going to say, I saw something on Game Pass today.
6104904	6105785	Yep.
6106046	6115122	At Fate's End is a 2D game from the Spiritfarer team and looks like a really cool art style with that.
6116224	6118808	So that's going to be probably out later this year.
6119395	6123664	Gears of War Reloaded showed off some gameplay.
6123885	6132965	It certainly looks like Gears of War and they're going to be launching the pre-release beta later this week, I think, actually on the 13th.
6133125	6137134	So you can check that out as well very soon.
6137333	6141763	Persona 4 Revival is finally revealed.
6141803	6145370	They kind of teased that off a bit and looks gorgeous.
6145390	6149419	So looking forward to seeing how that does.
6150310	6152673	More DLC for Sea of Thieves.
6152974	6155136	Believe it or not, it's season 17.
6155277	6159162	And so now they're adding smugglers and Tide.
6159903	6168234	So you can actually have, you know, they're making an emphasis on explosions and you're able to salvage for new weapons.
6169095	6172139	Also, it is, you know, of course, now multi-platform.
6172179	6173061	So that's a thing, too.
6175243	6177887	This is one of those where the...
6178222	6184689	The cinematic cutscene looked incredible, and then when they showed the game, I was like, eh, alright, I guess.
6184709	6190615	But Invincible is getting a game, so Invincible Versus, it's a fighting game, three on three.
6191717	6202288	But yeah, I had high hopes, really high hopes for it when they were actually showing off the story cutscene stuff, because it looked straight out of the actual show and everything, but...
6203500	6220058	Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrate Xbox One
6220038	6221299	I believe very soon.
6221559	6227905	And then they also announced that Final Fantasy 16 is shadow dropping for today.
6228185	6229206	We need the sales.
6229226	6231508	Please pick up this game right now.
6231528	6232209	Yeah, yeah.
6232229	6233049	So buy it.
6233470	6233890	Buy now.
6233930	6234411	Consume.
6236392	6249724	Keeper, which is a weird looking game where you are playing like a living lighthouse and I don't really know what you do with that, but you are a lighthouse creature and it's coming out October 17th.
6250835	6251776	What else?
6253398	6258866	We had Phil Spencer teasing that there's also going to be more stuff coming later on.
6258946	6260648	More announcements.
6261209	6268879	They said there's a new Forza game coming as well as some stuff with a return of a classic game.
6270501	6272584	Maybe a new Halo game or something like that.
6272724	6273906	I don't know.
6273886	6287710	and last but not least they showed off a really neat looking sci-fi thing with like robots and stuff and then at the very end it was revealed to be Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and I was like oh never mind I'm not excited anymore
6289816	6293140	There was an interesting... It has the guy from Heroes in it, right?
6293160	6296004	He had an interesting teaser, too, about next year.
6296164	6300229	He's like, there'll be a new Forza next year, Fables next year.
6300910	6301591	There's one other one.
6301611	6305876	And then he said something about... And then we're coming back to one of our 25-year-old games where it all began.
6305977	6310322	All but confirming these rumors that Halo Combat Evolved is getting yet another...
6310302	6319918	Redo, because if you think about it, Master Chief Collection was a redo, but it's going to get yet another one that'll be out, which also kind of makes sense because Halo's kind of due for a new game, right?
6320419	6322643	So that would make a lot of sense for next year.
6322963	6325387	Well, Halo Infinite didn't work out, did it?
6325467	6325948	Right.
6325928	6333467	So I thought it was interesting that he kind of teased like laid up 2026's calendar too, which you don't usually see game companies do, which I thought was very interesting.
6333908	6336315	And there's still like more opportunity than out some of that stuff.
6336335	6341608	They could do that closer towards the end of the year during game awards or like even...
6341588	6347195	I don't know if there's going to be a lot being done at Gamescom or anything like that, but yeah, maybe.
6347355	6350960	Oh, Gears of War was the other thing he had mentioned for 2086, something in that.
6350980	6358009	So, yeah, but that was, yeah, so the Microsoft thing, I didn't get to watch it live, but it seems like it was fine.
6358650	6363636	Again, I think the sort of thing where like maybe there was some stuff in it for you, but maybe a lot of it wasn't.
6364537	6367842	But that's what, you know, game companies have to kind of try to appeal to everybody, right?
6368022	6368943	So it can be tricky sometimes.
6369404	6370465	So, yeah.
6370445	6381636	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6382342	6391515	Missed opportunity to maybe drip feed a couple more games into the retro classics that just came out a couple weeks ago and has not had any new games added to it yet.
6391535	6394039	So I thought it would be a weekly cadence like AntStream.
6394059	6395822	It appears not to be.
6396402	6400228	The notifications are still not working on my system on PC.
6400288	6402131	Maybe they work on an actual Series X. I don't know.
6402551	6408320	But a little surprise that that one is already starting to wither away a little bit.
6408340	6410543	So I hope that they will...
6410523	6436294	Put some attention on that as well in the coming weeks Alright, well, that was a lot of announcements So we had Switch 2 releases, Xbox, State of Play, Summer Game Fest But there were a lot of smaller announcements that happened too Loki, I don't know if there's anything that caught your eye I don't want to necessarily recap the 20 other shows that happened this week But were there anything you want to bring up?
6437287	6466197	not a whole lot I know there was the Day of the Devs but they kind of covered some of the same games that some of the other ones did so like Mixtape was shown, Big Walk Marvel Cosmic Invasion that type of stuff so I don't really know if there was anything there that was interesting I did look into the Devolver Digital thing I didn't see their showcase at all but there's a game called Ball Pit
6466733	6475172	It's Ball X Pit, and it's a roguelike game that kind of has a mechanic... It's... I don't remember the name now.
6475232	6481587	I think there was, like, it's like Wizorb or something like that that was on the Xbox 360 that was kind of like a...
6481921	6489392	RPG, but it had the Arkanoid type breakout mechanics with the balls bouncing around and stuff like that.
6490093	6492837	Similar to that, but there's no brick breaking in this.
6493037	6502731	But you basically fire balls and they bounce off the walls and it does damage against the enemies and you get different balls that enhance your attack and stuff like that.
6502771	6503733	So it looked kind of cool.
6504394	6506637	So that's something that's coming out a little bit later on.
6507699	6507979	Um...
6509225	6509926	Yeah, I don't know.
6509946	6511449	I haven't really noticed any other stuff.
6511470	6516961	That's the kind of thing, even with E3, back when that was a thing, is that there's just a lot.
6517281	6520408	It's hard to visit every booth and play every game, right?
6520848	6521510	Yeah, exactly.
6521530	6530608	It's hard to keep track of everything, so certainly Steam Next Fest will be a nice way to check some of these things out.
6530588	6536040	You know, I went through when I saw a lot of these and kind of wishlisted a bunch of stuff so I don't forget about it.
6536060	6540048	And then you can also like wait and see when stuff goes on sale.
6540208	6542834	Like Avowed just went on sale for 25% off.
6542894	6545700	So maybe I'll look into that.
6545820	6546542	Like, I don't know.
6546642	6548185	Or I may play it on Xbox Free.
6548426	6548907	Game Pass it.
6549869	6550791	Yeah, well...
6551227	6557737	Yes, unfortunately, like my other game consoles, my kids are monopolizing them.
6557797	6564288	So my son is playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for like the third or fourth time now playing through that again.
6564428	6566351	So he's doing that.
6566531	6571198	But yeah, I guess PC Game Pass.
6571479	6572000	I could do that.
6572020	6572320	I don't know.
6572340	6572981	I'm complaining.
6574303	6574864	Yeah, I don't know.
6574884	6576126	I like it being through Steam, though.
6577689	6577789	Okay.
6577809	6577989	Whatever.
6578009	6578550	Whatever.
6578817	6579258	All right.
6579278	6580220	Well, you know what?
6580240	6585991	There's plenty more weeks in the year, and there'll be plenty more news to come and follow-ups, and we'll stay on top of it best we can here at OLR.
6586632	6589277	A lot of people were expecting Nintendo to make announcements.
6589337	6589918	I don't know why.
6589998	6591120	They launched a console this week.
6591220	6595509	I don't think they're going to... I mean, they could do something next week.
6595529	6597452	I just... I wouldn't hedge my bets there.
6597693	6598935	My guess...
6598915	6607724	If Nintendo does summer announcements, they'll be in July because they're going to want to remind people that that Donkey Kong game is coming out and to pick it up and all the cool features happening with that.
6607764	6609986	So there'll definitely be some sort of deep dive with that.
6610006	6614491	So maybe a Nintendo Direct to go with that, that maybe will date some of the holiday releases.
6614511	6616533	I do think they want to date the holiday releases.
6616553	6624181	So I think there will be something in the coming months, but I would put my money on July around the time the Donkey Kong game releases is probably a safer bet.
6624201	6624501	Yeah.
6624481	6624882	Yeah.
6625883	6626283	All right.
6626944	6629247	Well, let's get into the classic game of the week.
6629287	6631070	DarkSakura isn't here.
6631090	6632352	So that means one of us gets to pick.
6632452	6633673	I decided to pick tonight, Loki.
6633974	6635075	I want to have fun with this.
6635436	6641985	I want to have fun with this segment tonight because you're going to laugh when you hear what I picked because I did not pick a game because it was a good game.
6642005	6643106	That's all I'm going to say about it.
6643166	6646050	So let's roll the bumper, shall we?
6656408	6684407	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week okay and reminder DarkSakura is not here tonight so I get to pick instead and the game I decided to pick you know it's E3 week and you know what would have been E3 week historically but it's no more and we have all these other things instead but I thought you know what let's go back
6684387	6687436	to a real E3 moment with our classic game choice tonight.
6687456	6691246	That's right, tonight's classic game is Genji Days of the Blade.
6691346	6692770	That is the game that I have picked tonight.
6693693	6698607	Genji Days of the Blade was a game that was published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
6698627	6699409	It was a direct...
6699389	6701573	Game for the PlayStation 3.
6702034	6705921	It was released under the newly rebranded Japan Studio.
6705961	6707665	Obviously, Japan Studio was around forever.
6708326	6710750	But I guess they had rebranded for the PlayStation 3 or whatever.
6710991	6712614	They're no longer around.
6713436	6717443	Most of their folks are on Team Asobi now, which of course makes Astro Bot.
6718345	6721110	This is very much not Astro Bot.
6721090	6736686	It's based off of historically accurate things.
6736666	6762471	and DarkSakura.
6762451	6764521	You're in a battle with a giant enemy crab.
6765103	6765666	That's right.
6766048	6769423	Genji Days of the Blade is the giant enemy crab game.
6769443	6770689	That's this game.
6771850	6775436	So in this game, you know, it's essentially this game at the end of the day.
6775496	6776899	It's very similar to Onimusha.
6777359	6779503	It's kind of, you know, Sony's take on that whole thing.
6779523	6781266	But it did, I mean, the last game did pretty well.
6781546	6786475	I think the only reason this game didn't do well was probably because of what happened at E3.
6787396	6790622	Because otherwise it looks like a pretty competent fighter game.
6791063	6794508	I've maybe played it once and that might be being generous.
6794529	6796592	But let's be real, for a game of its era...
6796572	6817602	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6817582	6825216	The game did get an award though from IGN, Best Artistic Design for the PlayStation 3 in 2006.
6825256	6829865	And of course, the real legacy of this game is the giant enemy crab meme.
6830386	6834173	Producer Bill Rich, I'm so sorry Bill.
6834153	6851048	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6851028	6871551	and there's real time weapon change the power of the PlayStation 3 although in all seriousness I mean the PlayStation 3 a lot of the content being on the hard drive which wasn't a thing that was on the PS2 or PS1 actually having that stuff without loading times actually was somewhat of a technical you know it's not like it never occurred in PlayStation 2 games but
6871531	6901470	but being able to switch things in and out that fast was something that games having installation footprints to the hard drive on the PlayStation 3 would allow it just wasn't articulated in that particular way so yikes you know the official US PlayStation magazine scored this game 4.5 out of 10 when your own propaganda machine can't even give your game a good review it doesn't look that bad there were worse games on the PlayStation 3 but
6902429	6903991	Anyway, there it is.
6904011	6905633	That's the classic game of the week.
6905693	6907235	Yes, I know, but here's the thing.
6907296	6911401	DarkSakura, she doesn't always pick great legendary games.
6911902	6923237	Sometimes she's picking a game because of its history, and that's why I have picked this game as well, is its footprint that it left on the memes and the giant enemy crab.
6923257	6924619	Genji, Days of the Blade.
6924779	6926782	Enjoy your classic game of the week.
6928544	6929145	All right.
6930560	6936588	Loki, we've covered a lot of the news, so I think now we just need to get maybe some of these quick hitting things again.
6936608	6938798	So let's do some rapid fire news, Loki.
6939352	6944000	Yeah, so we got some news regarding the PlayStation Plus Classic catalog.
6944020	6947245	I believe this was during the PlayStation Showcase thing.
6947766	6959506	But essentially that they're going to be adding Deus Ex on June 17th, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 on July 15th, and Resident Evil 2 and 3 later this summer as well.
6959646	6962170	So look forward to those.
6962150	6972985	Um, and then, uh, we've got news that the Switch 2 is selling out, but they are expected or they believe that they can meet the demand through the holiday.
6974106	6978232	Um, but I'm curious to wonder how, how the tariff situation is going to go.
6978332	6979774	Yeah, that's the unknown.
6979794	6981817	Between now and then, there's a lot of days.
6982177	6985542	So far, Japan hasn't been like kind of, um,
6985522	7007057	and the crosshairs with that but you never know I will say this I think we need to give credit where credit is due for all the shit we've given Nintendo about hardware launches in the past and rightfully so I think they got this one pretty good it does seem like if you tried to get a Switch 2 and correct me in chat if I'm wrong but if you tried to get a Switch 2 you got one
7007037	7015769	And maybe I'm wrong, but there were a bunch of people that walked up at Best Buy at midnight and still walked away with one, and there were more on the shelf the next day.
7016110	7024562	My understanding is because they never said that Costco was going to be a retailer for Switch 2, that Costco probably still has these on shelves.
7024582	7027005	I mean, they're in bundles, but the bundle's not bad.
7027546	7036318	The bundle is a, because you buy things in bulk at Costco, but it's a Switch, it's Mario Kart, and it's a year of Nintendo Online.
7036298	7060365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7061088	7077612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7077592	7080277	DJ Ranma S says, also, we're in an endemic state.
7080557	7082100	Products are plentiful now.
7082220	7088130	You can't use that excuse with how the NES Classic and the SNES Classic and so many things before went, though.
7088410	7095001	Nintendo doesn't usually nail hardware, or it's been a long time since I remember Nintendo nailing a hardware launch.
7095122	7097646	So this seemed to go pretty darn well.
7097746	7100691	So I'm going to give him credit for that.
7100711	7101372	So...
7101740	7105825	All right, let's talk about some other headlines in rapid-fire news.
7105865	7118841	Speaking of the Switch 2, there are some unannounced improvements to old Switch games, maybe because they didn't get a new patch, but due to the nature of the hardware, the emulation, they are running slightly differently in a good way.
7118861	7120923	So what I mean by that, Smash Bros.
7121023	7124607	Ultimate, improved loading speeds, but you'd expect that, right?
7125248	7128372	Bayonetta 3 is now running at 60 frames a second.
7128520	7155726	Batman Arkham Knight is running at a steady 30 frames a second Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity now has an uncapped frame rate so it runs like really good on Switch too Witcher 3 is running a steady 30 frames a second it's so wild to think that it wasn't running that smooth before but it was the OJ Switch we're talking about Pokemon Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl improved loading speeds and Animal Crossing New Horizons also improved loading speeds so generally
7155706	7178035	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7178015	7179417	I thought this was interesting.
7180178	7182782	A prototype of Duke Nukem D-Day.
7183142	7188149	This was a Duke Nukem game from Rockstar that was in development in the early 2000s.
7188630	7190473	It is now leaked to the internet.
7190493	7193096	It was supposed to be released in 2001.
7193897	7197723	Rockstar was supposed to publish it, but it didn't end up happening.
7198324	7201408	Like a lot of Duke Nukem things, it ended up getting screwed.
7203911	7206435	Apparently, though, this
7206415	7234363	a build of the game was found apparently Apogee and 3D Realms founder Scott Miller had an industry insider friend who found a build of the game or covered one and a screenshot of the game made its way out and it was never publicly shared but now it's been publicly shared and if you want to go to archive.org you can find it and check out Duke Nukem D-Day for yourself but do remember it was a prototype so you can expect it's going to be a little bit buggy so but it's probably better than Duke Nukem Forever
7235272	7264772	uh probably I don't know all right let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming out real soon um I know we're slowing down a little bit after last week but there's still still a little energy going this week right still some things yeah yeah we still got a few things so we've got uh this week of course Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Dune Awakening on PC Mind's Eye on PC PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
7264921	7286001	StarTrucker on PlayStation 5, Warhammer 40k Space Marine Master Crafted Edition on PC and Xbox Series, Stellar Blade on PC, Forgotlings on PC, Virtual Girl at World's End on PC and Nintendo Switch,
7285981	7306437	Wizard of Legend 2 coming out of early access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series The Altars on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series And finally, Five Nights at Freddy's Secret of the Mimic on PC and PlayStation 5 Nice
7307041	7308563	Alright, let's go to Japan.
7308683	7315210	There's nothing on the Switch 2 this week, because I have to work that in my releases now, because obviously we had the big blitz last week.
7315270	7322859	But we do have some releases on the OG Switch still, and of course these games play on Switch 2, including we have the Irem Collection Volume 3.
7323580	7329066	This includes Mr. Heli, as in helicopter or battle chopper, depending on the part of the world you were in.
7329086	7329767	That game is in it.
7329847	7334132	Mystic Riders and Dragon Breed are all a part of this collection.
7334152	7336575	Again, that's on the OG Switch, but, you know, it
7336555	7341680	Virtual Girl at World's End, also on the Switch in Japan this week.
7341740	7345283	Asande Chess is also out on the Switch this week.
7345723	7350408	And then I think that's it for the Switch in Japan.
7350428	7352470	Let's take a look at the PlayStation 5, though.
7354572	7359316	I think we are... Oh, that same Irem collection is out on the PlayStation 5, but that's it.
7359376	7360697	Pretty quiet week in Japan otherwise.
7361158	7362018	How about the UK?
7362038	7363540	Do we have that, Loki?
7364200	7364841	Yep.
7364922	7370388	So in the UK, we've got Mind's Eye on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.
7371209	7373091	Stellar Blade on PC.
7373911	7379117	Wizard of Legend 2, also coming out of early access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
7379838	7384362	Memory Lost on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series, and Xbox One.
7384923	7393512	Five Nights at Freddy's, The Secret of the Mimic on PlayStation 5, and The Altars on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
7394487	7395352	All right.
7396664	7401030	Lots of games to add to your backlog this week, but not a ton, thankfully.
7401110	7404955	Get a little room to breathe and actually play all those games you bought for your Switch 2 last week.
7405095	7406077	Oops, wrong shot there.
7406097	7409902	Okay, let's move on to our listener roundtable.
7409922	7416311	We invite you guys to ask us questions in our Twitch chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, but we also welcome your emails.
7416331	7420156	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.
7420216	7421498	I should check Blue Sky as well.
7421538	7424562	I don't remember seeing anything, but I will take a peek.
7424542	7429768	Just to make sure, because I missed one last week, unfortunately, so I don't want to miss anything this week.
7431810	7433572	Yeah, let me read this, because I missed it last week.
7433612	7439078	DarkTetsuya had made a post to us on Blue Sky saying, Just a quick note, thanking all the folks for the support this week.
7439098	7444364	We had a medical emergency fall into our laps, so thanks everyone in the OLR VOG crew for their support.
7444724	7448228	Yeah, I'm glad to see Mish is doing great and is in our chat tonight, I believe.
7448248	7452473	So hello, Mish, and hope your recovery is going swimmingly from all of that.
7452453	7453955	We do have some emails tonight.
7454015	7455597	Believe it or not, two emails tonight.
7456038	7457159	Participate at Orange Launch Radio.
7457180	7461766	And they're both from people we don't hear from very often, which I love the emailers email us all the time.
7462166	7464349	I love hearing from people we don't hear from very often.
7464690	7465932	So let's get to the email bag.
7465972	7467774	Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
7468215	7470638	Our first email tonight from Bryguy2365.
7470758	7477127	Bryguy2365, who sent us an email and the subject was called...
7477107	7480030	How an old fart plays Fortnite Mobile.
7480050	7482152	Do you remember this discussion last week, Loki?
7482613	7489940	We were talking about Fortnite Mobile and I was like, but I'm so old, I don't understand how this works.
7489960	7490281	Right?
7490701	7491222	Remember that?
7491882	7494005	Yeah, with on-screen controls.
7494185	7498970	Yeah, well, here's... So we got this email and I'm gonna... It even has, like, photo evidence and everything.
7499030	7499871	I'm gonna get into this here.
7499911	7500592	Okay.
7500612	7501713	Hello, OLR friends.
7502033	7503695	Bryguy2365 here.
7503795	7504836	Last week...
7505272	7508419	Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
7508439	7521947	Oh, yeah.
7521927	7550955	well played I forgot about these controller attachments that you can put on your phone because it is a little weird that Apple doesn't have like at least as far as I know like an official official like first party controller like all these are supported through third parties to my knowledge and I don't you know again and then in the the Google verse there's kind of multiple phone makers anyway but yeah the minute I saw the picture which I'm showing for folks on Twitch uh I was like oh which by the way that's a fancy like gold is that like a gold
7551644	7574547	and DarkSakura.
7574527	7592248	Death Star Event
7592228	7614810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7614790	7617012	I'm going to get out of the house, which doesn't always happen.
7617433	7619855	I'm going to get out of the house and I'm going to go do raids downtown.
7619875	7622838	There were Gigantamax raids today in Pokemon.
7622858	7624980	And I went and I threw Campfire.
7625681	7627983	I found the local group and I was like, you know what?
7628003	7628444	Screw it.
7628504	7629565	I'll go and check it out.
7629925	7633028	And there was a decent, there was maybe like 12 people walking around.
7633349	7636252	But because of all the remote people that raided in, we had to ease it.
7636272	7637973	We took everything down super easy.
7638574	7641557	And I got three Gigantamax Cinder Aces.
7641537	7667055	none of them above a two-star appraisal which is sort of irritating but oh well what can you do all right uh let's go to the next email because I said we had two emails tonight our next email oh dang it I closed the tab that had it um Loki do you have something to buy me time while such as a last minute story while I pull up the email again because I foolishly closed it
7667812	7669274	Yeah, let's see.
7669354	7672178	So we were talking about Super Smash Bros.
7672378	7675923	Ultimate on Switch 2 and how there's some enhancements.
7675943	7678085	There's also some downsides to some of that.
7678105	7682932	Apparently there's some issues if you're playing against someone on Switch 1 and they have a Mii Fighter.
7683613	7684914	It kind of breaks the game.
7685375	7689360	And so be careful of that because it will kick you out of your game if you try to do that.
7690021	7692184	So, uh, yep.
7692985	7696029	Alright, I recovered the email.
7696069	7696890	Here we go.
7697073	7721764	Thank you very much.
7721744	7738133	Thank you for watching!
7738113	7740216	The honest answer to that is no.
7740657	7744162	I very rarely go back and look at older episodes.
7744303	7745424	I will say this.
7745444	7746987	This has been very interesting.
7747648	7762230	So one of our folks on Discord, who I've brought up on the show before, 13xForever, built this script that scrubbed all of our old shows from the OL Archive and basically did these transcriptions.
7762868	7783155	and although you know I always say about the old shows they are relics of the past and of their time and not all of them have aged well and I think you always need to keep that in the back of your mind if you're gonna go you know because there is if you wanted to listen to just about every episode of OLR that ever existed I think there's only maybe two that are gone forever from the live only days and
7783135	7800655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7800635	7804442	is this whole, you know, and I say this very tongue in cheek.
7804462	7807587	I'm very humble about this, but sometimes it is really funny.
7807607	7814981	This whole Rob Stradamus trend where I said something on the show and then, you know, years later it becomes a thing.
7815001	7822474	And I think the biggest example that I can think of was when the Nintendo Music app happened and I was like, what episode did I talk about that in?
7822454	7851162	and because you can search the transcripts now was able to find what episode I talked about it in so I could put that old clip on up on YouTube and go I am smart and you know and this happened also recently with I don't know something else where I was like didn't I talk about that oh it was the um it was this the Mortal Kombat thing I was like what episode did I talk about that in that came up and then you know well well actually you said it would be a gold master game and it's not a gold master game show you were wrong but
7851563	7860440	Yeah, and it was also, I think, when we were trying to figure out who coined the phrase TTP first.
7862143	7864507	Oh, yeah, you were trying to figure out the time to penis thing.
7864828	7865149	Yeah.
7865489	7866551	Yeah.
7866672	7868315	You found out you weren't first.
7869477	7872222	No, I think it was...
7872826	7877734	Spore is like someone I think may have mentioned it around Spore or something.
7877754	7877974	Oh, well.
7878134	7878976	Anyway.
7878996	7879236	Anyway.
7879837	7880799	Let me go back to the email.
7881139	7887970	So it's interesting how the older episodes have come in clutch for doing research and that sort of thing.
7888611	7893238	But no, I barely listen to the new shows.
7893258	7894680	I'm here now.
7894700	7895642	I'm hearing it now.
7896103	7898066	Like that's from my perspective.
7898767	7898867	Yeah.
7899337	7905123	I'm living it, so I don't often... But I will go back with the critical ear sometimes and be like, oh, how did that come across?
7905143	7905703	How did that sound?
7905723	7906244	Could it be better?
7906644	7911589	You know, once in a while, but I also try not to overthink it and just let it be because we are live.
7912710	7921599	So it's rare, but of course, once in a while, I'll come across an old clip or something on YouTube or something.
7921619	7923641	I'm just like, oh, that's kind of interesting.
7923661	7924922	Anyway...
7925172	7942725	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7942705	7950800	We got together live and we listened to episode one with our commentary over the very first episode.
7950840	7951942	We did this a couple years ago.
7951962	7953405	Actually, it was like three or four at this point.
7953425	7954407	This was during COVID, I think.
7954828	7958375	We listened to our 19th anniversary show, which, yeah, would have been 2021.
7959116	7959376	I'm sorry.
7959397	7961841	We listened to our first show with commentary.
7961861	7963685	And I think that one is still there.
7963785	7964967	I think some of those...
7965790	7968253	Oh no, it was deleted.
7969094	7970736	Oh, that sucks.
7970757	7971337	That's a bummer.
7971818	7972619	I don't blame you, Bobby.
7972659	7973300	I blame Twitch.
7973520	7974662	It is what it is.
7974682	7975322	So never mind.
7978066	7978807	Carl, never mind.
7978927	7980289	I didn't say anything about that.
7981551	7983093	Well, you know what that means?
7983113	7985195	We just have to do it again sometime.
7985316	7987719	Not episode one, but maybe episode 100.
7988380	7992405	Loki, if there's a night that DarkSakura isn't here, we need to go back and listen to episode 69.
7992805	7993266	Okay.
7994461	7998747	Only because I say that because DarkSakura wasn't there for the actual.
7998767	8002473	That was when Karaoke Revolution was played live on air.
8002493	8009484	And that was the notorious... That was the notorious Loki doing... I don't want to do that.
8009744	8014351	I didn't want to even like... I didn't want to even do that.
8014371	8016835	So I restrainly changed the lyrics.
8017175	8019018	Anyway, anyway.
8019178	8021822	It's also one of those things that didn't age well either.
8021842	8023725	No, it didn't age well with time, but...
8024313	8025567	I was right there, Loki.
8025588	8026458	You had permission.
8027206	8027510	All right.
8027550	8027995	Anyway.
8029173	8029954	Let's move on.
8031675	8033257	I wouldn't have given myself permission.
8033277	8038561	This email isn't really going anywhere to make at least some content out of it.
8039042	8046308	How many years or console generations do you think Rockstar will get out of Grand Theft Auto 6 when it finally arrives?
8047029	8048731	Or a million.
8048751	8049231	I don't know.
8049271	8059180	Do you think that might be their last single player GTA and they'll push towards GTA Online and expansions and versions thereof since it's such a cash cow?
8059160	8080662	No, because I think that they were originally talking about doing that back with 5 with online was supposed to be like that too like they were going to have different cities and stuff I think what they're going to realize much like with everybody like EA has already figured this out that like hey, yeah we could keep expanding this one thing
8080912	8085479	But then that means, you know, if we put out a new game, you gotta buy all that stuff again.
8085640	8090828	So, like, we'd rather you buy it again for a second time or third time or fourth time.
8090848	8091830	You know, that type of stuff.
8091990	8097098	And so that's why they will never just make one giant...
8097365	8119558	and so on.
8119538	8128052	So now we're paying for all this server space and stuff to run all this, and it's just not making us the infinite amount of money that we want to.
8129294	8134582	Yeah, it'd be cool if they had one giant universe, but I don't want to see how that's monetized.
8134602	8136866	Oh, I gotta pay for my flight to Liberty City.
8136906	8140592	It's gonna be $4 million because everything's inflated in that game.
8141613	8141954	I don't know.
8142695	8142795	Yeah.
8143788	8144129	All right.
8145010	8147854	I'm sure you'll be rammed with Switch 2 release news this week.
8148054	8149056	Good luck.
8149076	8151840	Wish you all the best and look forward to future shows.
8152060	8154043	Signed, Carl from Southampton, England.
8154103	8154924	Thanks for the email.
8155025	8158530	That was lovely to hear from some folks we don't hear from all the time.
8158570	8160513	So I encourage more folks.
8160533	8161033	Don't be shy.
8161694	8162576	Ask a silly question.
8162656	8163477	Get a silly answer.
8163697	8166421	Or participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8166682	8167763	Not that that was a silly question.
8167783	8168985	That was a good question.
8168965	8189438	it would be interesting like we're talking about older episodes it would be and I know like we talk about AI and stuff but this is where we talk about AI in the sense that it's a utility and not necessarily replacing something but like to throw those old audio files that were made for dial-up radio through something to enhance the audio on them
8189418	8191561	Yeah, I wonder if that would be a thing.
8191581	8192102	Maybe.
8192242	8193163	I don't know.
8193183	8193624	Check out.
8193945	8194966	Sure, we could check it out.
8195246	8197890	I'm not opposed to it because I look at that as kind of like a tool.
8199853	8200835	But I would want to know.
8200855	8206463	I would have a lot of questions about what's the tool and what's it going to save from what it listens to and those types of things.
8206483	8207805	But it could be interesting.
8208045	8209367	It could be very interesting.
8209887	8210288	All right.
8211310	8213295	Well, that's it for the listener roundtable.
8213315	8219328	And I think with all the news and things we've covered tonight, I think that's it for the show.
8220030	8221193	Thank you all for being here, though.
8221373	8221894	Appreciate you.
8221934	8223819	Wait, actually, Loki, did you have any other last minute stories?
8223919	8225382	I only let you do one.
8225362	8254963	yeah one quick thing is I didn't even know this was part of Street Fighter 6 but apparently Street Fighter 6 has a gallery section that you can play games in and so with their newest update with the DLC Fighter Alina they added some games to their game center so you can play Bionic Commando Street Fighter 2010 The Final Fight, Mighty Final Fight and Mega Man 3 they're fully playable oh yeah it's so random but I like that
8255399	8256721	All right.
8257262	8259646	Well, thank you as always for listening to Orange Rounds Radio.
8259666	8262631	If you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend about the show.
8262671	8263612	Help us spread the word.
8263632	8265035	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8265155	8266437	We need more voices to put out on air.
8267058	8271646	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show.
8271906	8273188	By the way, one of our...
8273168	8289220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8289200	8297112	I made a boo-boo and the wrong, in my naming commission, I uploaded the wrong file so you got the same episode twice.
8297493	8302441	So by the way, if you did not hear last week's episode, there was a new episode, 1049 on June the 1st.
8302461	8311955	If you did not hear it, go back in the podcast feed and grab it because it was corrected on Monday morning when I woke up to all the messages of, you fucked up!
8311975	8313498	But, you know, it happened.
8313518	8314279	Look...
8314259	8317924	Look, 1,049, now 1,050.
8319266	8320048	Mistakes happen.
8320508	8322371	Sorry.
8322391	8327719	But yeah, definitely check out last week's episode if you didn't, but also check out, you know, future episodes and all that good stuff.
8329001	8330503	Five-star reviews go a long way.
8330543	8331805	Thank you very much for that.
8331825	8333888	Let's get final thoughts and we'll get out of here for the night.
8334749	8336672	Loki, your final thought for tonight.
8337496	8351801	Hopefully they have to play more Mario Kart this week because my son's going to be taking... He's already played through, what is it, all of 50, 100, I think probably 150 at this point, like CC's unlocked almost everything already.
8352141	8357310	Thankfully it's on his profile and not mine, but like, you know, we'll see.
8357543	8382876	My final thought tonight I'm probably doing a late night Pokemon stream I mean late night, sorry, West Coast and I think a lot of my streams are going to end up late night just because it's the easiest time for me to game I'm probably going to do a Pokemon stream tonight but I'm not rating into myself after the show because I can't do that and I'm going to eat dinner so maybe in about an hour or so we're going to have a late night Pokemon stream so I'm looking forward to that play some more Pokemon so I hope to see you there if not though I understand and I'll be streaming more throughout the week
8382856	8385360	Next week we'll be back.
8385380	8387523	We'll talk about the latest and greatest that's developed over the week.
8387543	8387984	Who knows?
8388084	8390268	Maybe some more surprises, although I wouldn't hold my breath.
8390728	8393693	DarkSakura will be here and we'll catch up with her as well.
8393713	8396397	So we hope to see you all back here next week in seven days.
8396457	8398380	Until then, have a great night, everybody.
