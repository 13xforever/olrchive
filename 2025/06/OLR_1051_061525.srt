1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:14,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Builder Rocket Boy's debut title, Mind's Eye, has released a critical WTS.

2
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:20,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The game with a 10-year plan now rests on the credentials of a former GTA producer being able to pull the rabbit out of the flaming hat.

3
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Daikatana, eat your heart out.

4
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:27,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sad for the engineers who had to crunch to get the game out the door, now have to crunch to get the game up to some definition of par.

5
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:33,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Shrub Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

6
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:36,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

7
00:00:39,232 --> 00:00:46,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:56,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again June the 15th of 2025 with episode number 1051 of our show.

9
00:00:56,376 --> 00:01:01,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Here with you every week on Sunday nights live and throughout the week on our podcast available worldwide.

10
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:04,648
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever your fine podcasts are downloaded.

11
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Rob Roberts.

12
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with you every week.

13
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:14,404
[SPEAKER_03]: And my co-hosts, both with me back this week, no nights off tonight, say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,248
[SPEAKER_01]: My defense, I was dancing.

15
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

16
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, I'm the one missing next week, but we'll get into that a little bit.

17
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:23,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a busy time here.

18
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:24,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also missing, technically.

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you?

20
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:25,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you?

21
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:26,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Techmaster Loki, hello.

22
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:28,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You're missing as well.

23
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be missing as well, yes.

24
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:30,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

25
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's summer.

26
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are going on.

27
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are exciting.

28
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, DarkSakura, you weren't here last week.

29
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,765
[SPEAKER_03]: What was exciting for you in the last couple weeks?

30
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:39,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I was dancing.

31
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:40,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, dancing.

32
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dancing.

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dancing.

34
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:49,276
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a ballet recital, and then it went really well.

35
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:50,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked really, really good.

36
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:57,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We had issues with our cloaks for our first number, but the rest of it was okay.

37
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:57,923
[SPEAKER_01]: We did our best.

38
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:58,623
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

39
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:03,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet nobody noticed except you guys who know what's supposed to happen.

40
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:04,430
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few people who said something.

41
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you videotape it and watch it back later?

42
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:10,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

43
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:11,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people did.

44
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody in my group ever goes.

45
00:02:16,865 --> 00:02:21,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I get asked a lot with this podcast, do you listen to your own show?

46
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, hmm...

47
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I'm here.

49
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:29,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to hear it live.

50
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:32,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't usually listen to the recording.

51
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:39,150
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes I'm kind of like, I wonder how a certain bit sort of came across, you know, or how it kind of might sound.

52
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So once in a while, I'll listen to it.

53
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't.

54
00:02:42,193 --> 00:02:46,377
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because people will be telling me that something happened on a certain episode.

55
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:52,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't remember what happened last week, to be quite honest.

56
00:02:52,342 --> 00:03:15,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

57
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:24,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only the incredibly polished AAA, why I would say maybe even quadruple A game known as Mind's Eye.

58
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:25,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is this Mind's Eye?

59
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:31,564
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I know very little about this game, but I know it's all over the news this week and we'll get into that a little later.

60
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy, have you played this at all or just experienced the memes?

61
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not.

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Picking it up.

63
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:49,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I do kind of I do kind of want to play because it sounds like Saints Row in the sense that it's buggy as hell, but like in some hilarious ways, but also in some non-hilarious ways.

64
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:50,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

65
00:03:50,588 --> 00:03:52,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like it?

66
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:53,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks very Grand Theft Auto.

67
00:03:53,314 --> 00:04:06,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would say when I look at the game, like just the movement of the characters and how like they kind of interact with things reminds me a lot of Grand Theft Auto, which I mean makes sense because it's Leslie Benzies who was a producer of Grand Theft Auto.

68
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:10,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

69
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:18,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Mighty No.

70
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: 9

71
00:04:41,354 --> 00:05:03,075
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

72
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,778
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get into a lot of details.

73
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:10,328
[SPEAKER_03]: They just say there is a tentative detail for a new interactive media agreement with major video game companies.

74
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:19,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a union statement, they say, pursuant to the authority previously delegated by the national board with the advance and consent of the IMA negotiating committee, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

75
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:40,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

76
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,890
[SPEAKER_03]: on productions under the IMA.

77
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, especially big companies, Activision, Disney, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, and so on, will be able to go back to work.

78
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great news to hear that this has all finally come to a close.

79
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we still have a lot of questions.

80
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:02,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby says, did Variety say it was ended or was suspended?

81
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:03,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it's...

82
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:09,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It is suspended pending that agreement, but it is looking like it will end.

83
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:14,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a lot at this point for it to be held up.

84
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:23,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It would basically take a rejection of that vote for this to not end, which seeing as they are recommending that vote in a yes is very unlikely.

85
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:29,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And folks are able to return to work, which is also an important thing to note with that.

86
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Now...

87
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:40,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting, the timing, because to me, this goes back to, and this was something we said when Darth Vader was in Fortnite.

88
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:53,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I recall saying very explicitly when there were those clips within 15 minutes of Darth Vader AI going live in Fortnite and James Earl Jones having racial slurs, homophobic slurs.

89
00:06:53,553 --> 00:07:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Any shitty thing an internet person is going to make a person they have control over say was said within 15 minutes.

90
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:04,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, they did their best to patch that all out as fast as they can.

91
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:12,896
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe I said something to the effect of they just handed SAG-AFTRA the biggest bargaining chip in these negotiations.

92
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:17,862
[SPEAKER_03]: SAG-AFTRA can walk into that room Monday morning and go, what the fuck?

93
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:19,864
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we're demanding AI protections.

94
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:43,793
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

95
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Darth Vader in Fortnite, and all the shitty things the internet made poor James Earl Jones do, may he rest in peace.

96
00:07:52,301 --> 00:08:00,994
[SPEAKER_03]: All those things brought a lot of awareness to how AI can actually not be a good thing in a lot of circumstances, especially with open borders, be that as it may.

97
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:07,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as a reminder, and before I get corrected on it, SAG-AFTRA did already call out, well,

98
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:35,025
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

99
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:41,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Robin Williams was not able to provide the voice of the genie, and that was due to a dispute issue in the beginning, I believe, with Disney.

100
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:47,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan Castaneda, I believe, from The Simpsons, did the genie in a couple of the sequels.

101
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:48,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Robin Williams came back, and it was a big deal.

102
00:08:48,857 --> 00:08:54,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But voice parts do get handed off, so do we fucking need AI to do it?

103
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:54,883
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

104
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have other actors play the parts.

105
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, SAG-AFTRA had already taken issue to, and then here we are a

106
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the official tentative agreement.

107
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:34,560
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

108
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,205
[SPEAKER_03]: and so Mass Effect was the only thing we could not advertise as Mass Effect.

109
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Mass Effect or Dragon Age?

110
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Mass Effect because those were the voice actors that we had at the time.

111
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:54,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, Dragon Con's a little more about celebrating the culture as opposed to hyping upcoming things, so we were not hyping Dragon Age at that time.

112
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:57,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the voice actor cast was known that...

113
00:09:57,727 --> 00:10:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Carameldansen

114
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:32,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but excited to hear that the strike is finally getting resolved and it's very interesting the timing of it all.

115
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:46,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may inevitably actually be thanking Fortnite for bringing awareness to this issue of what bullshit is possible with AI having completely open borders on people's talent and likeness and things like that.

116
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:47,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

117
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

118
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SJ100Math in our chat says, I imagine they won't say anything for a bit.

119
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta wait for the agreement to be final final.

120
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:58,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's gotta be approved by the union insiders.

121
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:01,686
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be done, done, done.

122
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: More to come on that in the coming weeks.

123
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:10,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry about that, but it was an important thing to put out there because we just said it as recent as last week.

124
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,920
[SPEAKER_03]: The strike is still going on.

125
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to be able to say maybe not so much now.

126
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:20,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we're making some progress on some fair agreements for our hardworking voice actors.

127
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:26,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not believe the number of AI signs, though, I saw online.

128
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

129
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:34,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

130
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:36,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

131
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:42,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

132
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:49,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the, you know, I saw some footage from the event that was going on in Washington, D.C.

133
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:52,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously a lot of people had had some things to say about that.

134
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:55,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't help but notice... Nothing happened in Washington, D.C.

135
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing important happened in Washington, D.C.

136
00:11:57,776 --> 00:12:01,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I happened to notice a woman was wearing a shirt that was talking.

137
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It said something, the big, beautiful military.

138
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was an AI logo.

139
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's what we've resorted to?

140
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: As like, oh my God, it's just, it's wild.

141
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:11,897
[SPEAKER_01]: An everything computer.

142
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:12,578
Yeah.

143
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing nothing happened.

144
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:17,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I love a homemade protest sign.

145
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:24,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see one that my pal Aria Snark, Victoria, made for when she went in LA.

146
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:31,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And she made a sign that said, May I remind you that it does not say RSVP on the Statue of Liberty.

147
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was written and it had Alicia Silverstone from Clueless in the corner.

148
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what the quote is from.

149
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:35,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia Silverstone.

150
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:36,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had the Statue of Liberty.

151
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:39,129
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looked like a magazine collage.

152
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:41,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I love me a homemade sign.

153
00:12:41,633 --> 00:13:05,329
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's it's great so anyway I saw a Bianca Del Rio face in front of me just the eyes and mouth that just said not today Satan that's good and a new friend that we made there had a very tiny tiny little sign and it says a tiny sign for a light tiny man that's good that's good

154
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:06,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I love protest signs.

155
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:11,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad I wasn't able to do it, but my sister was in town yesterday, so we did Father's Day a little bit early.

156
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but I enjoyed seeing all the footage of so many people at those events, and then the little tires squeaking at the other event.

157
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty great.

158
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:22,673
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no other event.

159
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,434
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?

160
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:24,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

161
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into other gaming news we want to talk about at the top of the show here that I'm not injecting at the last minute.

162
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:31,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

163
00:13:32,242 --> 00:14:00,865
[SPEAKER_04]: yes let's talk about Sony and all of their accolades so I guess they must have had an investors meeting recently but there's a lot of different comments regarding their strategy coming out so of course it makes perfect sense Sony gonna double down on those live service games they are not to be perturbed by the failure of Concord they still are hoping that of course uh

164
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,319
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, something to the effect of Marathon is going to do really well.

165
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with that, though, is it hasn't really been received all that well.

166
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:13,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I mean, stolen art and all that stuff as well.

167
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

168
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, but the kind of outside of the kind of canned...

169
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:47,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Corpo speak it sounds like the game's probably gonna be delayed again um and it probably should be because I think it needs a lot more polish to make it something unique and something actually people want um along with that of course the whole reason that they're trying to use their internal studios to create these large titles that are trying to pull people to the platform is they're kind of going the opposite strategy of Microsoft in the sense that they don't really see

170
00:14:47,521 --> 00:15:15,199
[SPEAKER_04]: PC, etc.

171
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:23,084
[SPEAKER_04]: which I understand that but I think people have also realized that you can probably just wait for some of this stuff.

172
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:35,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we really need to have the FOMO of purchasing a $600 console plus these $80 games and all that for what may be something you can play on PC if you have a PC?

173
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:36,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

174
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:42,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, definitely they recognize how popular they are but

175
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:55,497
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not going to basically publish day and date with PC because they don't want to lose that edge that they have with these exclusive titles and

176
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:59,801
[SPEAKER_04]: along with that, of course, they are doing really well as it is.

177
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: They have had the most profitable generation so far in the PlayStation lifetime.

178
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:09,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been more profitable than the PlayStation 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined.

179
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

180
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:13,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, their revenue is up.

181
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you charge $70 for a video game, you're going to make a lot more money, aren't you?

182
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:25,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, their revenue is up and operating income is also up as well, which also kind of, it's a little bit of a head scratcher with some news we'll have later on that like

183
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:29,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so then why are you still laying off people?

184
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: If your revenue and your income is that high, I mean, we're talking about $13 billion versus the last highest generation was the previous generation, which was $9 billion operating income, so that's beyond all the actual cost.

185
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:49,385
[SPEAKER_01]: They needed just that little bit more to build their new summer home.

186
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, correct.

187
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:55,150
[SPEAKER_04]: How many summer homes do we really need?

188
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one summer?

189
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:58,033
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you travel to all these homes?

190
00:16:58,153 --> 00:16:59,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Climate change, Loki.

191
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:03,020
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to keep moving the summer home because it keeps getting hotter and hotter.

192
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:15,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I see in the chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Mike Deft says it was over 110 degrees Fahrenheit during the whole weekend, which is why they didn't protest down there in his area, even in other countries in Mexico.

193
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

194
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:26,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so like basically, I don't necessarily feel bad for these companies, but I think that right now Marathon doesn't stand.

195
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:32,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in a really good, have a good footing for jumping into the market right now.

196
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:33,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not unique enough.

197
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,173
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks extremely generic.

198
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:45,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking that they may just have to delay that a little bit longer to give it some personality because otherwise they're going to launch it and it's going to fail again.

199
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:46,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

200
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: In the words of the great Alyssa Edwards, global drag queen phenomenon, I smell a stunt.

201
00:17:55,427 --> 00:18:02,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like what's going to happen with Marathon is you're going to see some type of stunt to try to make it really stand out.

202
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that, I'm thinking – let me give you an example.

203
00:18:05,228 --> 00:18:11,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Keanu Reeves coming out on the stage and announcing that he's in Cyberpunk 2077 and being a character in that.

204
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:25,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to take some type of like stunt casting like that or some type of – because I don't know what within the game we get people talking as much as like a potential like celebrity that no one expects to be in a game.

205
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:25,667
Yeah.

206
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when Peter Dinklage was going to be the voice of whatever the hell that character is?

207
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they completely erased him out because he was terrible.

208
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:38,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they erased that, and that wasn't a big deal anyways for the whole Destiny 2 stuff.

209
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:39,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Destiny or Destiny 2?

210
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:45,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the original Destiny, and it kind of was a big deal, Loki, because they had to erase it with Destiny 2, so...

211
00:18:45,779 --> 00:19:08,479
[SPEAKER_03]: so like it's yeah I I don't know like stunt casting I know I'm not big on stunt casting but I don't look I'm not big on a lot of decisions made in the gaming industry but I mean depending on who they get it could make me laugh I say go for the memes go for go for something that's going to be funny get Taylor Swift I don't know

212
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:11,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

213
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

214
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: They got Travis Kelsey's mom to be on the new season of The Traitors, which, by the way, is a show I thoroughly enjoy.

215
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:22,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's always like freaking stunt casting stuff.

216
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, why not?

217
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

218
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Dylan Efron to be in Marathon.

219
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make people pay attention.

220
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:30,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it.

221
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:31,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

222
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says, get a marathon runner, an Olympian.

223
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're thinking.

224
00:19:37,003 --> 00:19:37,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're thinking.

225
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some marathon in my marathon.

226
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:57,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Stunt Casting Stunt Casting

227
00:19:57,953 --> 00:20:15,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But not the type of stunt you saw at Summer Game Fest where somebody made a very desperate plea to make their game stand out above all the others by sounding like a complete edgelord on stage and wearing a hat that wasn't very funny and, you know, ended up having to apologize for it this week, which we'll talk about later.

228
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:21,885
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole thing about that was we were trying to do something to make our game stand out.

229
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:25,489
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an idiot.

230
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:37,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just get sad when I think about all these people that sat in a boardroom and gassed themselves up to think that that was a good idea on how to do it.

231
00:20:39,230 --> 00:21:01,221
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

232
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:09,777
[SPEAKER_03]: to what gamers are actually looking for in games will sit around and hype themselves up to what a great idea they have to win gamers over.

233
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

234
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:16,141
[SPEAKER_04]: From an idea that's essentially Portal anyways.

235
00:21:16,622 --> 00:21:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Portal FPS.

236
00:21:17,763 --> 00:21:18,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

237
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,286
[SPEAKER_03]: It's FPS with portals.

238
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

239
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,228
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

240
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:22,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

241
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, great.

242
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the way Quest Buster phrased this in chat.

243
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:29,521
[SPEAKER_03]: People talked about it, but as for anyone playing it, it is another story.

244
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:33,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, talking and playing, because you still have to click that download button.

245
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:36,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are two very different actions.

246
00:21:36,925 --> 00:22:02,342
[SPEAKER_04]: so anyway yeah and just because like people now recognize what your game is it's like I get it there's that whole saying of like no publicity is bad publicity but I don't think that fits here like honestly like like that would be the equivalent of me like getting up there in the game wards or whatever like that and like announcing hey look at my pixel poops game and then taking a dump on the stage like

247
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that get attention?

248
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant!

249
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:06,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You should!

250
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:07,995
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

251
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we be doing that?

252
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:10,848
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

253
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:12,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously not.

254
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,873
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a stupid, stupid idea.

255
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But make sure you take a dump on another game.

256
00:22:18,696 --> 00:22:22,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you do it on copies of, I don't know, Mind's Eye or whatever the game is.

257
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you do it on Mind's Eye just to make your point.

258
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:34,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can't lift, you know, as was shown at the Summer Game Fest, you can't lift your own game up without saying, I'm sick of Call of Duty.

259
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:36,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't Call of Duty a terrible game?

260
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:38,978
[SPEAKER_03]: You should just shit on Call of Duty, Loki.

261
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:47,449
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd have to be Marathon, because obviously they're joggers running across the park, so that fits the best, I think, in alignment with Marathon.

262
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,693
[SPEAKER_04]: As runners, but like, yeah.

263
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:53,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, PodCulture in chat says, Call of Duty.

264
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,021
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be, if you ever do a Pixel Poops 3.

265
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

266
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:04,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying you need to, but if you ever do a Pixel Poops 3, it's gotta be Call of Duty.

267
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:21,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Pixel Poops 3D, Call of Duty Pixel Poops 3D, Call of Duty But when it's 3D it's gotta be the red and blue like Rad Racer or it just adds a little depth, that's all

268
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, before we get into our gaming weeks, we're going to talk about what's going on this week.

269
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:37,657
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just got a text message from my sister, actually, who says that my dad is watching right now, apparently, but can't figure out how to use the chat room, which is fine.

270
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:39,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So a big hello to dad.

271
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, and a happy Father's Day to you.

272
00:23:42,543 --> 00:23:49,532
[SPEAKER_03]: A happy Father's Day to all the father's figures and all that out there and to all of the special daddies in my life.

273
00:23:51,841 --> 00:24:05,800
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

274
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:36,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Palia, my usual stuff I mean I really I've been so busy with last week getting ready for recital and then this week I've had ballet more I'm starting a new class next Friday I was gonna start it this past Friday but I was tired and I was gonna go to the protest so but yeah just really my focus has been ballet and political action and just my usual games all right we'll go over to Loki how was your gaming week

275
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:40,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It was basically just Minecraft stuff, nothing really super productive.

276
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I did spend like a couple days coding in a data pack to make... So we have this game that's running on our server right now.

277
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it's called.

278
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's basically where you're not supposed to sleep.

279
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all the phantoms and stuff spawn above you and try to hunt you down.

280
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:01,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So I made those really annoying and deadly.

281
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:03,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

282
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:30,546
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

283
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see my gaming week.

284
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still enjoying my new Switch 2.

285
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:35,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing Mario Kart World.

286
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:44,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got through all of the 50cc tracks so I could unlock, you know, it's not really a spoiler for me to say Rainbow Road is the last track you're going to get.

287
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:46,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So it works.

288
00:25:46,034 --> 00:26:11,569
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

289
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: and like I don't want to get too far into it but I was bit by a dog on Tuesday which if you know me I've always had this like because I was bit by a dog when I was a kid so I've always had this weird aversion to big dogs and so the fact that one like actually bit me and yeah this actually I was going out for a walk um and I just had left my house and was starting to go through the neighborhood and this guy had a big huge dog this dog bit me in the stomach

290
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:58,566
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

291
00:26:58,546 --> 00:27:23,575
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

292
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:39,572
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

293
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:59,940
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

294
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: that just came out on PlayStation 5.

295
00:28:02,105 --> 00:28:04,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also on Switch 2, but I've been playing it on PlayStation 5.

296
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just, like, I've gone for... I've unlocked way more stuff.

297
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to finally get to, like, the next tier of crafting.

298
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:13,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I unlocked every job.

299
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:15,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Did at least... Well, no, because...

300
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:36,559
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:28:36,539 --> 00:29:01,062
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

302
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:06,674
[SPEAKER_03]: They craft their own homes with furniture that you can also build and craft.

303
00:29:07,094 --> 00:29:10,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying fantasy life a lot, so I'm excited to do more.

304
00:29:11,023 --> 00:29:14,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwell says there's seven chapters in the main quest.

305
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember seeing chapter numbers.

306
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

307
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably wasn't paying attention, but I could tell you I think I've unlocked three or four trophies.

308
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:31,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look, because unlike Switch, PlayStation has trophies, and I think you get trophies at the end of every major step in the main story.

309
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in the quest log, you can see them.

310
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'll have to bring it up and check.

311
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,443
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that play the game, I just went through a forest area

312
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:56,327
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's having me go unlock farming so actually that's probably the easiest benchmark I give because I can tell this is unlocking farming because you go to a giant farm where all these farmers are and I'm pretty sure that's where the story is headed so

313
00:29:56,982 --> 00:29:57,282
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

314
00:29:59,184 --> 00:30:03,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Mish in chat says, Oh, Rob, if you like that game, you might like Dinkum.

315
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too sure, though.

316
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:11,535
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the chill crafting genre is so big right now.

317
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we have so many games.

318
00:30:12,716 --> 00:30:16,800
[SPEAKER_03]: People obviously still play Animal Crossing.

319
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DarkSakura's down with the Palia.

320
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:22,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it, because I've played and spent a lot of hours on that game, too.

321
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:24,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably would play more if I just didn't have all these other games I was juggling.

322
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:25,167
[SPEAKER_01]: There's issues in Palia.

323
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:27,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, is there?

324
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,211
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

325
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,515
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a fun vibe.

326
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:51,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they're getting it fixed soon, but right now, if I load into my main property, whatever my first property I load into is fine, but if I switch properties, the furniture inside of buildings is gone, and on one of mine, the lines of books and lamps and things are floating amongst the trees a few meters away.

327
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got screenshots.

328
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:53,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.

329
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:56,191
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that's a bummer, but hopefully they get through that.

330
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:59,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But Disney Dreamlike Valley is another one I'd throw in that category.

331
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:03,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the chill crafting genre is having its heyday.

332
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:13,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, Fantasy Life is, it's kind of that, but it's a little bit, there's just a little bit of like Zelda Link to the Past style combat in there too.

333
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little dash of that thrown in.

334
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:21,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to call it a chill crafting game, but it's a low stakes game.

335
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:23,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

336
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:28,229
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster in chat says, it's so nice hearing how well Fantasy Life is being received.

337
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a game on my must-play sometime list.

338
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I recommend it.

339
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:37,609
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like those types of just like chill, casual games, I think there's a lot here for folks to enjoy.

340
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:42,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I do regret not waiting to get it on the Switch 2.

341
00:31:42,299 --> 00:32:06,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only reason to get it on the PlayStation 5 would be trophies like if you're that big of a trophy whore but I think that's a very very very small percent of the population and there is cross save I did notice that when you save you can cross save I think it is available on PC as well because it talked about needing an Epic Games account to do cross save but I would have got it on Switch too if I knew then what I knew now so but it is what it is

342
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Stardew Valley, Questmaster brings up as well.

343
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's never gone away.

344
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:13,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always been there.

345
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:16,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And Minecraft!

346
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:19,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we love a crafting game.

347
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:23,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to get into some more gaming news.

348
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick programming note.

349
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:29,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been mentioning this for a couple weeks, but just to make sure you all know, we will not be here next week.

350
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be in Atlanta, Georgia.

351
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:34,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be from Atlanta, Georgia next week.

352
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:47,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Nicole Page Brooks, I will be at Southern Fried Gaming Expo over the weekend.

353
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:48,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really looking forward to it.

354
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very fun convention.

355
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Smaller than DragonCon, but that's not a bad thing.

356
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:56,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I love being able to just pull up a chair and play some board games.

357
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Play some game room type games, whether it's pinball or arcade games.

358
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf and I will have a panel on Friday night about veteran podcasters talk about classic video games.

359
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:17,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be talking about classic video games that we think have been missed by most people.

360
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, sure, you could say Zelda or Katamari Damacy was brought up earlier.

361
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:25,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Katamari Damacy is a classic game you should play.

362
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:26,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not.

363
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:27,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, obscure.

364
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly, exactly.

365
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:32,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is a classic game, but I don't know if that's necessarily obscure enough.

366
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:37,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the bro camp thinks it's obscure, but you know, not everyone's into Madden.

367
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:45,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bobby has also called this panel Rob's excuse to get up on stage and talk about the Guardian legend for an hour.

368
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, he's not wrong.

369
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, drag me.

370
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you got me.

371
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:51,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

372
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yes.

373
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:54,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Accurate.

374
00:33:54,969 --> 00:33:55,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Accurate.

375
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't attack me this hard during Pride Month.

376
00:33:59,694 --> 00:34:01,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it is, yeah, absolutely.

377
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:04,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be talking about the Guardian Legend as one of the games.

378
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,340
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been calm for, okay?

379
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,502
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been calm for.

380
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:11,988
[SPEAKER_01]: He went in your dressing room and cut up all your wigs.

381
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:12,549
[SPEAKER_03]: What wig?

382
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:13,189
[SPEAKER_03]: What wig?

383
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:17,494
[SPEAKER_03]: The bitch is already bald, y'all.

384
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,936
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said wigs.

385
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:21,179
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

386
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but that'll be Friday night at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

387
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:27,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be, you know, I'll be around all weekend.

388
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:31,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leaving Sunday, but I have enough time Sunday to enjoy most of the show.

389
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:33,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it'll be good.

390
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:34,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited.

391
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:42,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf will also not be here next weekend as something about sports ball right after Southern Fried.

392
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:46,054
[SPEAKER_03]: He has to go to Southern Fried Sports Ball, but that'll be fun, too, I'm sure.

393
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:53,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be back in Atlanta in like seven or eight weeks after this weekend to go to DragonCon.

394
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:55,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming up real quick.

395
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Really excited for this year's DragonCon.

396
00:34:58,988 --> 00:35:06,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say I won't know what panels I'm doing until probably two weeks before, and even then they can probably change, so stay tuned to socials.

397
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:15,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say the one panel we know that – well, it's not really a panel, but the one event Bobby and I know that we will be doing at DragonCon, so you can put it on your calendars now –

398
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:37,928
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

399
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:44,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been podcasting for a little bit now and doing Twitch streaming, so maybe I have some insights somebody else might appreciate.

400
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:49,083
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be Thursday night at DragonCon, which is Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

401
00:35:49,263 --> 00:35:51,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Really excited about all of that.

402
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Not here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.

403
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, let's go over to Loki and start off our news of the week.

404
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's talk about the game that's behind me, Mind's Eye.

405
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, came out, AAA game, no complaints whatsoever, except, yeah, it sucked.

406
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:17,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been buggy as, it's basically cyberpunk all over again almost, except, you know,

407
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:45,748
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

408
00:36:45,728 --> 00:37:01,948
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been clips circulating around of cars clipping into each other and then of course as you touch the car they just explode in physics and there was another sponsored segment where we had some streamers basically having trouble

409
00:37:02,215 --> 00:37:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

410
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:39,445
[SPEAKER_03]: and if you want to pick up Mind's Eye it's available now on PC and all this stuff and he's like trying not to bust up laughing like he's got a face like and sorry I have to describe it for the podcasters but it's that like I'm trying not to bust up laughing but it's like just that whole irony of like what has my life become I'm sitting here recommending broken shit to people

411
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another one I saw as well.

412
00:37:42,450 --> 00:38:02,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So a Twitch streamer by the name of ConeCarnage was about to start a playthrough when he got an urgent email from the actual game developer saying that they're canceling the sponsored playthrough because it's been so poorly received.

413
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,563
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I've never had that happen.

414
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:06,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That is interesting.

415
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,428
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's been lots of pushback.

416
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony has even removed it from the PlayStation Store and has been issuing refunds for the PlayStation 5 version because it's been also crashing.

417
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:23,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so it's not in good shape right now.

418
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:33,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, like I said, you know, lots of poor reviews and just it's being dragged all throughout the Internet right now.

419
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:36,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have missed it.

420
00:38:36,538 --> 00:38:38,320
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the worst rated games this year, I think.

421
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have missed it, Loki, but Bobby in chat asked a very good question.

422
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this an $80 game?

423
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:46,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an $80 game.

424
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:49,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It is at least a $60 game.

425
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:54,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have it on my wish list right now.

426
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:59,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I didn't know it was going to be a piece of trash when it came out.

427
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:00,229
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important.

428
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:02,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki likes broken games.

429
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:03,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like...

430
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:06,778
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be fun, just like kind of sandboxing.

431
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:14,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I like a good sandbox game that's got glitchy traffic in ped physics or weapons or whatever the case may be.

432
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:18,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hear it's like a real slog to get through the whole thing.

433
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so Mind's Eye...

434
00:39:20,978 --> 00:39:36,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the $60 game.

435
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:59,845
[SPEAKER_03]: and Loki is the only person I know that would sit there and actually play Driver 3 for a significant amount of time not like the five minutes to do one thing and go lol this game sucks and go on to the next game actually sit there and go I can break it like this and I can break it like this and when I do it it's stupid I love it like Loki like loves broken games

436
00:40:00,382 --> 00:40:21,715
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

437
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:30,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Close proximity of them that was kind of like stupid and dumb and had them running around in their game because they thought they were so edgy and like, look at us.

438
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Our game is a Grand Theft Auto killer.

439
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, it's not.

440
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:36,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not at all.

441
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:39,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the old shenanigans.

442
00:40:39,836 --> 00:40:42,960
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the type of shenanigans that like, you know, this...

443
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:58,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Blitgate or whatever should be doing not wearing stupid hats making stupid bold assertions in your game you know you should have had Master Chief just getting destroyed super easy or something like that you know because your game is so good like that that's how you do it it's still bad but yeah

444
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:00,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

445
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:09,987
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBusterChat says, from what I understand, the game was supposed to leverage another project called Everywhere that was supposed to be like Roblox but with more realistic graphics like those in Mind's Eye.

446
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:16,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a linear experience set in a world designed for an open world experience but is treated like a very pretty obstacle course instead.

447
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:19,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you talking a little bit about this last week?

448
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't this the same game?

449
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:23,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I think someone brought up something like that.

450
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I know that they had that platform.

451
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:32,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, a bold assertion that anyone's going to want to do things on your platform.

452
00:41:32,983 --> 00:41:44,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I want to say that Fortnite tried doing... Or Epic had done something similar with that, where they had a platform that was essentially Unreal Engine, but it had...

453
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:47,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortnite stuff in it, but not actually Fortnite.

454
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,255
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be a game platform that they could make games on and stuff.

455
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:54,885
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think they ended up pivoting that into Fortnite to actually create games within that.

456
00:41:56,488 --> 00:42:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been done to death like several times where they're going to create these giant platforms because they want that Roblox money.

457
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my kids were telling me, was it that...

458
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:10,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow a Garden keeps gaining 2 million players every day.

459
00:42:12,983 --> 00:42:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the largest video game out there now.

460
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:21,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This no-name game made by some dude in their... probably some kid in their garage.

461
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:26,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... I'm talking about taking it back, but not in a good way, though.

462
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: These are bad games.

463
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not good games at all.

464
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people are playing them for some reason.

465
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:34,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

466
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

467
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:45,675
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have a deluxe edition for Mind's Eye for $80 so you can get that it has some skins in it for an extra you know more expense

468
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:49,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I feel like you know more about this game certainly than I do.

469
00:42:50,596 --> 00:42:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have an answer to this, but I look at a game like Cyberpunk 2077.

470
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:59,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Also had a pretty botched launch, ended up with refunds and all that stuff.

471
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:04,271
[SPEAKER_03]: But most people that played the game at this point would tell you they've turned that game around a lot.

472
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played Cyberpunk 2077, it's a good game and it's worth your time.

473
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,038
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time I was playing it on Stadia, it was a lot better.

474
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:22,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, well, wasn't Stadia, like, I remember a whole, like, thing where it was like, actually, it was best on Stadia because Stadia had the power to run it because it was a cloud thing.

475
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I remember that being a whole thing when that game came out.

476
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I digress.

477
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:32,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just that, too, is that you also didn't have to sit through a bunch of patching and everything, but you're right, it was an optimized system.

478
00:43:32,244 --> 00:43:33,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

479
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:35,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, Ranmari brings up Diablo 3.

480
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:36,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, pod culture.

481
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think Diablo 3 had like a bunch... Well, no, it did.

482
00:43:39,943 --> 00:43:41,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I mean, it was...

483
00:43:41,326 --> 00:43:47,876
[SPEAKER_03]: What I mean, like, I don't remember it being, like, buggy broken, but now I remember everybody got a login error that first day, so it was pretty screwed up.

484
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:50,059
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, the Auction House was a problem, yes.

485
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not saying Diablo III didn't have its issues.

486
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,144
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just different type of issues.

487
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And then PodCulture mentions No Man's Sky, which, again, I think different set of issues.

488
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:00,435
[SPEAKER_03]: The game wasn't, like, broken.

489
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:02,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't what people expected.

490
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Cyberpunk's a closer sort of thing.

491
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:08,127
[SPEAKER_03]: But, anyway, my point is...

492
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:14,513
[SPEAKER_03]: they turned all these games around and made them salvageable will this game be salvageable or are they fucked?

493
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:36,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that making them salvageable is kind of the exception to the rule because there's been a lot of games that have launched that they didn't really do that or didn't accomplish that completely so I don't know I don't know much about this development team so I can't really say that they would do that I would hope that you know

494
00:44:37,283 --> 00:44:43,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Leslie Benzie or whatever of Grand Theft Auto has made, you know, produced a lot of great games, is able to put out a good game.

495
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:53,419
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I mean, hey, we thought that the Mega Man creator could put out a good Mega Man game and... On a same...

496
00:44:54,108 --> 00:45:04,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the guy here with Mind's Eye should pick up the phone and call Sean Murray over at Hello Games, No Man's Sky, and just have a venting conversation, have a therapy discussion.

497
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I never want to see a game fail.

498
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to play, like, another Grand Theft Auto-looking game, you know, especially, like, a sci-fi one.

499
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks awesome, but...

500
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear this is dumb.

501
00:45:14,499 --> 00:45:20,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, already, like, speaking of, like, bad AI and the cops and stuff like that, like, I remember that was a thing with Cyberpunk.

502
00:45:20,807 --> 00:45:23,891
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit on the opposite side, whereas they were too deadly.

503
00:45:24,272 --> 00:45:31,041
[SPEAKER_04]: In this game, you could murder somebody right in front of the police robot and it just, like, keeps walking by.

504
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, whatever.

505
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what you're doing.

506
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:37,750
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty buggy and broken.

507
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:43,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay Helinski in chat says, that seems to be the world in which we live these days, though.

508
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:45,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Push out a turd and fix it in post.

509
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:49,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why everybody's pissed about $80 video games.

510
00:45:50,204 --> 00:45:53,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nintendo rarely pushes out

511
00:45:53,913 --> 00:46:18,081
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:21,326
[SPEAKER_03]: When I don't know the team making it, I don't know.

513
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:25,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's claiming to be a such and such killer without the evidence to back it up.

514
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:37,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think gamers are getting a lot more savvy to that type of stuff than when we lived in the era of getting all of our information from magazines where we can see it a lot more directly in real time.

515
00:46:37,649 --> 00:46:46,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-ordering a game previously was because you wanted to make sure that whatever game store you're purchasing at has a copy for you.

516
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

517
00:46:47,727 --> 00:47:12,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Day One Skin

518
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:15,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I buy a collector's edition for this game?

519
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:16,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

520
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,674
[SPEAKER_04]: This game is a brand new IP.

521
00:47:19,054 --> 00:47:20,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is going to be successful.

522
00:47:20,477 --> 00:47:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want some like tchotchke and collectible thing to put on my shelf?

523
00:47:23,902 --> 00:47:28,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like Grand Theft Auto where they've had several successful releases or something like that.

524
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,051
[SPEAKER_04]: One after another.

525
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, why would I purchase a collector's edition for this thing that's brand new that...

526
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, there's a good chance it might suck.

527
00:47:39,895 --> 00:47:40,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

528
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:45,159
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a bold assertion for a first in a franchise game.

529
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

530
00:47:47,026 --> 00:48:09,068
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

531
00:48:09,048 --> 00:48:36,861
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was confirmed during this Konami series of announcements that the original Silent Hill Silent Hill 1 will get a remake from Bloober Team the same group that recently did Silent Hill 2 and the way Jamie reacted is the way most of the internet is reacting is that yes which is funny though because like what we saw initially when Silent Hill 2 was like oh no like everyone's like it's got that Konami stank on it and now it's like oh well Bloober Team's good

532
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:37,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

533
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my plea.

534
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:52,470
[SPEAKER_03]: As your podcast elder in video game culture, this is my plea to all of you out there making your own podcasts and your YouTubes and your Twitch channels and all this stuff.

535
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:58,055
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to highlight the bad shit, like we just did in that last story, you should highlight the good shit too.

536
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So we should take a minute and acknowledge, you know what?

537
00:49:00,898 --> 00:49:10,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloober deserved this because they did, despite the expectations that people had, they did a great job with the Silent Hill 2 remake, and now they're being rewarded with this.

538
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:12,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are being rewarded because we will get to play it.

539
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:16,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the Silent Hill 1 remake something I'm likely to pre-order?

540
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:17,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

541
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:18,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

542
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:38,185
[SPEAKER_03]: because now you've got the tracker now if it's $80 I don't know about that I don't know about that because the original is still around but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it um the Silent Hill remake is something I'm absolutely you know excited for uh and it's yeah it's well done by Bloober so congrats

543
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:56,680
[SPEAKER_03]: of course we didn't see hardly anything don't don't expect that we have footage it's just it's just they're gonna do it yay it'll probably take them two or three years at least to do it so I would almost like rather than make a new Silent Hill game instead of just remaking one like why why remake one at this point it's kind of

544
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.

545
00:49:58,784 --> 00:50:02,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand the charm behind the remakes and so forth.

546
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:06,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say don't do it, but I don't disagree with you, Loki.

547
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, ooh, they've done such a good job with this.

548
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not see what they can do?

549
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's because some of their own original horror IPs have been a little bit more mixed on the

550
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:47,575
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know they don't want anything to conflict there's nothing to say Blooper's not working on something like that too but Konami doesn't want to talk about it until Silent Hill F is out the door and has had a little space to breathe so you know they wouldn't want to announce this competing Silent Hill original game now with Silent Hill F around the corner but it's very likely that they're going to wait and see how Silent Hill F lands to decide what direction they're going to go to for future updates in the game but yeah I'm

551
00:50:47,555 --> 00:51:01,869
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, you know, since we're talking about the Konami did their own series, they mentioned that that Suikoden game that's supposed to be for mobile phones will also be hitting Steam, which is a huge relief for folks that, you know, would prefer to play keyboard, mouse, and that whole thing.

552
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:07,835
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Konami's been on a bit of a win streak lately.

553
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, again, we need to give credit where credit is due.

554
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:15,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And for all the fuck Konami era, which was justified...

555
00:51:15,382 --> 00:51:23,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost as if somebody out there, hold on to your hats, it's almost as if somebody out there listened.

556
00:51:24,629 --> 00:51:26,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost as if somebody listened.

557
00:51:26,432 --> 00:51:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp!

558
00:51:27,714 --> 00:51:30,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And started making pivots and said, you know what?

559
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Rinmari in chat says, I feel like Konami are healing.

560
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:38,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it definitely does feel like that.

561
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:42,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rinmari also says they separated their arcade game division from their gambling division recently.

562
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we had that.

563
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:48,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Rinmari's a big fan of Gradius, talking about the first serious Gradius project in 15 years.

564
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

565
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:55,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami has done a great job giving their strong intellectual properties to other developers who can nurture it correctly.

566
00:51:55,618 --> 00:51:56,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a bad thing.

567
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

568
00:51:59,603 --> 00:52:02,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Gradius, I think that's a good segue to our next story, DarkSakura.

569
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, but I don't know.

570
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not unexpected, but a little sad.

571
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:13,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Gradius V is being delisted from PS3.

572
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:18,463
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, PS3 is an old machine.

573
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:19,743
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an older game.

574
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:24,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but it's happening.

575
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:41,363
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was because of a license for the software that's being used in Gradius V. There was a re-release in 2015, and then there's the delisting happening this, so it's likely a 10-year license.

576
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:49,231
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, we've got Gradius Origins, so they'll have the compilation.

577
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:54,537
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't look like it's going to include Gradius V. That's a bummer.

578
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:56,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Gradius Collection will be tight.

579
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually would love to pick that up.

580
00:52:58,322 --> 00:52:59,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the one on the PSP.

581
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:02,727
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a Gradius Collection on PSP that was fucking fire.

582
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad it's kind of coming around again.

583
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:08,194
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a bummer about Gradius V, but...

584
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:11,171
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks for game preservation.

585
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:17,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand contract agreements, you only get so many years, blah, blah, blah, but it still sucks.

586
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:21,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't... I think there's a physical copy.

587
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:22,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I...

588
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Gradius 2 is better I love Gradius 2 as well

589
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:57,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay, before we get to our next story, Loki, I have to ask because I've been watching the Minds Eye footage behind you.

590
00:53:57,342 --> 00:54:01,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a CPR minigame that was happening in there?

591
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:12,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I swear you were having to tap to the beat and I'm going, they're actually teaching you the right because I while I was watching the pattern, I was going, staying alive, staying alive.

592
00:54:13,421 --> 00:54:14,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know, that's the beat.

593
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:43,268
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're supposed to do CPR to and there's a bunch of other songs that people use too but Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees is the one I always remember and I was like, they're actually teaching you the rhythm for CPR that's actually kind of neat in a way they have to patch the game because it's too hard or too like I think you have to be right on the money for that stuff in order for it to work and as

594
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:47,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Questmaster is saying that the games go on too long.

595
00:54:47,775 --> 00:54:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

596
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is the thing, though, they have in this game.

597
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:53,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

598
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:57,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I had to ask because that caught my eye and I was like, is that like a legit CPR minigame?

599
00:54:57,777 --> 00:54:59,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so wild.

600
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,441
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

601
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, Loki.

602
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:06,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about another console selling like hotcakes.

603
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:07,659
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the Switch 2.

604
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:16,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, what have we really shown Nintendo that will buy the Switch 2 or anything they sell for any price that they put it out for?

605
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:17,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We are all consumer whores!

606
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

607
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:20,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And hell!

608
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sold 3.5 million units in four days.

609
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:27,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the biggest console launch of all time.

610
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job on us.

611
00:55:30,963 --> 00:55:32,447
[SPEAKER_04]: We are part of the problem.

612
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:33,830
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

613
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,837
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few other factors that go into this that I think are important.

614
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, Nintendo actually had the supply to meet demand.

615
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:45,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And to their credit, that's probably why this console got delayed several times.

616
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:52,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly believe this console, I think this console, a form of it was probably going to be out years ago when the OLED came out.

617
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:59,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Nintendo may have been ready to launch this thing last holiday, but just didn't have enough of them ready to go.

618
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they waited and they had plenty to go around.

619
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:24,484
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

620
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:44,785
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

621
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:58,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think another important factor outside of the price that is important is that the age of people that have grown up with video games all of their life have gotten older.

622
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:09,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you have just as many people in their 30s and 40s that are excited for Pokemon as there are teenagers, right?

623
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:28,137
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

624
00:57:28,117 --> 00:57:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: and even if we're talking since 2017, even eight years is a long time for people to have gotten older and the buying power to be with more generations that have grown up with video games in their lives.

625
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a lot of that plays into why the Switch 2 is doing well as well.

626
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:55,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yes, I'm not trying to poo-poo on their accomplishments because, sure, Nintendo has strong IPs, Mario Kart

627
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,543
[SPEAKER_03]: sells bananas copies for reasons.

628
00:57:59,003 --> 00:58:00,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always strong.

629
00:58:00,045 --> 00:58:01,487
[SPEAKER_03]: They always do well.

630
00:58:01,507 --> 00:58:06,714
[SPEAKER_03]: We always knew Switch 2, there was going to be a demand for it, that there's going to be enough Nintendo fans to substantiate it.

631
00:58:07,115 --> 00:58:14,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's also important to recognize that, you know what, just in general, there's more people willing to drop the money on game consoles.

632
00:58:16,008 --> 00:58:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I met someone in the line for the Switch 2 when I said that I was at the same place for the 360 launch.

633
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:32,718
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that the 360 was his first ever midnight console launch, and that night was his kids' first midnight console launch.

634
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great... Yeah, and I think that story...

635
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly encapsulates what I'm talking about.

636
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more gaming built into the family entertainment system, really.

637
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:47,627
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's see.

638
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:56,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Rinmari says, I remember when Pokemon was seen as an uncool for kids only thing and pod culture said those kids are now adults.

639
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:56,360
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

640
00:58:57,762 --> 00:59:01,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when we were collecting the Burger King toys.

641
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,228
[SPEAKER_03]: No kings, but Burger King.

642
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when we were-

643
00:59:07,088 --> 00:59:18,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember trying to get those Pokemon toys and the workers thought we were ridiculous because we were college age adults in line for Pokemon toys, really excited about it.

644
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, you're not kidding.

645
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:22,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they didn't say that to us, but you can feel the judgment.

646
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these toys are for kids.

647
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:25,435
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the kids meals toys.

648
00:59:26,275 --> 00:59:27,396
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?

649
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:28,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, guess what?

650
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:31,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all adults now.

651
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, are you kidding?

652
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay Helinski in chat says, OMFG, the BK toys.

653
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:39,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We won that sweepstakes as kids.

654
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:41,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding?

655
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you win?

656
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the one that like Mew was super rare or something?

657
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:47,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Mew or one of them was really rare.

658
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:51,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you got it, you won some type of Uber prize.

659
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:53,602
[SPEAKER_03]: What a small world.

660
00:59:53,662 --> 00:59:54,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

661
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I want to come back to that chat comment when I have more.

662
00:59:58,439 --> 01:00:04,796
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, let's talk about some other things going on in Nintendo's world, which includes what's next for Splatoon?

663
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:09,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we, you know, Splatoon was a pretty big part of the original Switch lineup.

664
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:11,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's coming next for Splatoon?

665
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:24,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Splatoon was not a part of the Switch 2 launch, of course, but the upgrade for Splatoon 3, where it will run a little bit better on the Switch 2, as a lot of the other games have, that did hit this last week.

666
01:00:24,444 --> 01:00:25,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that was on the 12th.

667
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:41,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was announced in a little, I don't want to call it a direct, it was more of a Squid Research Lab update that occurred from Nintendo, where they talked about the upgrades for Splatoon 3, but there is also going to be a brand new spin-off game,

668
01:00:41,099 --> 01:01:10,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Splatoon Raiders

669
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:11,766
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that called with all the posts?

670
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:13,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how the posts would feed into Splatoon?

671
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is still a thing.

672
01:01:16,611 --> 01:01:25,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Miiverse is gone, but they built a similar version of that mechanic in Splatoon, and so there's all these messages in Splatoon.

673
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:35,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody had posted on Blue Sky this week, and I saw it, that if you go into Splatoon 3 right now, there's all these happy pride messages, very heartwarming types of things.

674
01:01:35,968 --> 01:01:39,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Squid rights and trans rights types of things that were in the game.

675
01:01:39,732 --> 01:01:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like,

676
01:01:40,212 --> 01:01:43,302
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see gamers being wholesome very often.

677
01:01:43,362 --> 01:01:44,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, Splatoon community.

678
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: You did the thing.

679
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:48,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cute.

680
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

681
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved seeing that.

682
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:54,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually made me want to visit Splatoon 3 again, to be honest.

683
01:01:54,438 --> 01:01:55,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty cool.

684
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So more stuff coming in the Splatoon world very soon.

685
01:01:59,305 --> 01:01:59,585
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

686
01:01:59,685 --> 01:02:03,911
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, a follow-up to the earlier comment about winning the sweepstakes by Jay Helinski.

687
01:02:04,612 --> 01:02:09,438
[SPEAKER_03]: The gold plaques, the balls, and a bunch of cards and other merch.

688
01:02:10,119 --> 01:02:11,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild.

689
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:13,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

690
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:14,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I never won anything as a kid.

691
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:15,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's not true.

692
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:23,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I won a contest at Dimple Records, a local chain which no longer exists anymore.

693
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:23,938
Yeah.

694
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:40,062
[SPEAKER_03]: and they once had a wheelbarrow full of smashed vinyl records and the contest was guess how many records are in the wheelbarrow and to this day I remember my answer.

695
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:41,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 79.

696
01:02:42,245 --> 01:03:03,527
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was right myself and one other person split the prize which was like a hundred dollar gift card or something like that and I remember as a kid I won this when I was like 13 as a kid I remember my logic was it looks like it's about 80 but it's not gonna be a round number so I put 79 and I was right

697
01:03:03,507 --> 01:03:29,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I outsmarted them so um but I won a gift card and that was how I bought Castlevania 3 Simon's Quest because they sold they used to sell video games I I'm sure you recall a day when they sold NES games at Dimple Record they're no longer with us sadly but um they sold uh Nintendo games and I bought Castlevania 3 with the money from the sweepstakes and then six months later my copy of the game was stolen out of my backpack at school

698
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:44,584
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

699
01:03:45,391 --> 01:03:47,214
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some SEGA stuff?

700
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:47,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

701
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:58,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually said that the Initial D racing team influenced how they wanted Sonic Racing Crossworlds to feel.

702
01:04:00,058 --> 01:04:03,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The producer Taki Ryuichi said

703
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:22,435
[SPEAKER_01]: and Kobayakawa Masaru, their creative director, spoke about the work they had going into this and said how they were totally into Initial D and that the team behind that was really crucial to helping the game find its feel.

704
01:04:22,415 --> 01:04:33,174
[SPEAKER_01]: They were saying that they wanted part to be like OutRun and this part to be like Sega Rally and going through those various games to incorporate what they wanted most in there.

705
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:44,153
[SPEAKER_01]: But they said the biggest influence was Initial D and Kobayakawa, the quote is, I've been working on the Initial D series for almost 20 years in the past.

706
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:52,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The gameplay of driving through winding mountain passes was very difficult, but the latest work, Initial D the Arcade, is surprisingly easy to operate.

707
01:04:52,831 --> 01:05:00,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason we were able to introduce the feeling we've built up over the years into this work is because the development was centered around the Initial D development team.

708
01:05:00,588 --> 01:05:01,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

709
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

710
01:05:32,227 --> 01:05:36,111
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says there's a new initial D anime out.

711
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:37,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

712
01:05:37,758 --> 01:05:42,023
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still people that play Power, Power, Paradise.

713
01:05:42,043 --> 01:05:52,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my friends had the version for PlayStation 2 recently, like within the last two months, had the PlayStation 2 version with the pink biscuits and had some friends over.

714
01:05:52,534 --> 01:05:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the other guys there was somebody that goes to Fanime regularly and all that stuff and knew all the dances still to this day.

715
01:05:59,982 --> 01:06:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got out there, I'm like, I know one.

716
01:06:01,945 --> 01:06:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Boom, Boom, Fire.

717
01:06:03,066 --> 01:06:03,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, Boom, Fire.

718
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:04,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, Boom, Fire.

719
01:06:04,948 --> 01:06:05,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Like,

720
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:05,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that one.

721
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:07,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just muscle memory at that point.

722
01:06:07,371 --> 01:06:08,213
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know them all.

723
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:10,055
[SPEAKER_03]: But this guy actually knew a bunch.

724
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:12,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm always like, Eurobeat lives on in our heart.

725
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:13,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

726
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:17,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year at TwitchCon, they had Parapara.

727
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:19,188
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

728
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I did the same three songs over and over, but they were always my favorite.

729
01:06:24,516 --> 01:06:24,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

730
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:28,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, one of them was Deluxe.

731
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, the ass-shaking one Wasn't the Mickey Mouse March one of the ones you did too?

732
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:34,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember No?

733
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:55,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought it was No, my big ones were Night of Fire, Eurobeat Night of Fire I used to know Ice Dime Us, but I don't remember that one very well Anyway And I knew a few others, but those were my big three

734
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranmari in chat says the old Eurobeat producers and labels have band camps now remember Eurobeat musicians aren't mainstream big name actual acts you don't say they're closer to AA musicians yeah I get it I think they've always kind of lived in that realm but it's cute so alright anyway let's move on to some shitty news Loki

735
01:07:16,058 --> 01:07:24,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we have word that Bend Studios has basically laid off at least 40 of their developers.

736
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:31,194
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because, according to them, earlier this year, of course, they wrapped development on a live service concept.

737
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And at their careful consideration, they chose not to move forward with it.

738
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:44,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And as they're shifting towards their next project, they've made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success.

739
01:07:44,138 --> 01:08:03,514
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

740
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:04,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Live Service Game.

741
01:08:05,737 --> 01:08:11,950
[SPEAKER_04]: This is weird because Sony is all about the live service stuff and yet they're turning all the stuff down.

742
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:13,734
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going all in on one or two.

743
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:15,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe don't put all those things in that basket.

744
01:08:15,418 --> 01:08:16,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

745
01:08:17,743 --> 01:08:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wild.

746
01:08:19,306 --> 01:08:31,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So, do you think... I mean, you were mentioning earlier in the show that, like, this is wild that these layoffs are happening while, meanwhile, they're shattering records over here.

747
01:08:32,051 --> 01:08:34,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why can't they move them to another project or something?

748
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... It's silly.

749
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:36,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

750
01:08:37,021 --> 01:08:38,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... It's...

751
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's fine.

752
01:08:40,944 --> 01:08:42,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what they're going to keep doing.

753
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:51,678
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to show more profit, but then now that this is the most profitable generation, your shareholders are going to want more for next generation.

754
01:08:51,898 --> 01:08:53,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be infinite growth.

755
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,942
[SPEAKER_03]: $90 games, Loki.

756
01:08:54,962 --> 01:08:56,264
[SPEAKER_03]: $90 games.

757
01:08:56,324 --> 01:08:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't stop.

758
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:57,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Won't stop.

759
01:08:58,146 --> 01:09:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's a good thing that Minds Eye wasn't a $90 game, but the fact that there was a version that was even still...

760
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:27,484
[SPEAKER_04]: you know $80 that is ridiculous like honestly like stop stop putting out these incomplete games I don't care if you're AAA studio or if you're just a small studio put out a game that is in a playable state you know and if it needs to be held back it needs to be held back yeah

761
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:44,106
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

762
01:09:44,086 --> 01:09:45,508
[SPEAKER_03]: We played other Bomani games, too.

763
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: We loved music-infused games.

764
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:48,192
[SPEAKER_03]: There still do.

765
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:49,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say the past.

766
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:55,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we don't go to the arcades anymore to play these games because they're not often... Well, a lot of the landscapes change.

767
01:09:55,763 --> 01:10:05,637
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not often there, but now with the return of Round 1 and sort of this... Sorry, the arrival of Round 1 and sort of this resurgence of Konami's arcade products.

768
01:10:05,657 --> 01:10:10,143
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you all know there were many years where there weren't just a lot of DDR machines to be found.

769
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:11,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It was extremely niche and...

770
01:10:11,525 --> 01:10:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real, we all got older and have asthma and can't do the very hard songs that we used to be able to do.

771
01:10:19,074 --> 01:10:23,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the landscape of what many arcades look like has really changed.

772
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, you see, like the last time I was at Roseville Golf Land, where this is the place where Loki, myself, DarkSakura would meet every single week to play DDR.

773
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had, what, like three DDR machines at one point?

774
01:10:36,436 --> 01:10:37,257
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of other stuff too?

775
01:10:37,658 --> 01:10:39,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, you know...

776
01:10:39,520 --> 01:11:02,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Ticket Redemption Hubs

777
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:12,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's actually not surprising to see that Konami is location testing this week a version of Dance Dance Revolution that spits out tickets.

778
01:11:12,308 --> 01:11:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Dance Revolution Stomp Arrows

779
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:51,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Spider Stomp

780
01:11:51,543 --> 01:12:11,931
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

781
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

782
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It just plays.

783
01:12:38,235 --> 01:12:44,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, you know, from the location test, we know that Party Rock Anthem is one of the songs.

784
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,304
[SPEAKER_03]: LMFAO is one of the songs that can come up in this game.

785
01:12:47,784 --> 01:12:51,929
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a version of the William Tell Overture that's in this game as well.

786
01:12:51,949 --> 01:12:55,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's going to be other Konami covers and things like that as well.

787
01:12:55,072 --> 01:12:56,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a few licenses.

788
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:59,776
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, apparently you do not even get to pick.

789
01:12:59,796 --> 01:13:00,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Max 300.

790
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:00,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

791
01:13:01,678 --> 01:13:04,581
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

792
01:13:05,253 --> 01:13:07,797
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a randomized song.

793
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You get one song per credit.

794
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess you can do three credits at a time.

795
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:16,809
[SPEAKER_03]: The step zone is circle around edges of the screen.

796
01:13:16,829 --> 01:13:18,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not actually even sure.

797
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:20,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it might be like a diamond type.

798
01:13:20,615 --> 01:13:22,137
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not arrows floating at the top.

799
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a diamond.

800
01:13:23,178 --> 01:13:25,181
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes into the center.

801
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:28,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So imagine if you will, like Tempest or something like that.

802
01:13:28,105 --> 01:13:28,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitaroman?

803
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:29,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Guitaroman?

804
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:30,028
Yeah.

805
01:13:30,008 --> 01:13:36,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I was just thinking, like, what in the groove arrow modifiers are we looking at here?

806
01:13:36,866 --> 01:13:46,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it feels like something straight out of Stepmania, where it's, like, kind of coming towards the screen from, like, I don't know.

807
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere in Game.

808
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:52,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's weird to have like a big vertical screen like that and then have the arrows come out of the center of the screen.

809
01:13:52,503 --> 01:13:55,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, shouldn't it be vertical because the screen is vertical?

810
01:13:55,492 --> 01:13:57,718
[SPEAKER_04]: This is literally the perfect format for that.

811
01:13:57,758 --> 01:14:00,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, do something else, I guess.

812
01:14:01,042 --> 01:14:02,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

813
01:14:02,884 --> 01:14:05,626
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no e-amusement support, which isn't that surprising.

814
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:11,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is that after you clear a stage, a super bonus challenge will come up.

815
01:14:11,592 --> 01:14:16,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You step on the up arrow and it does a roulette and you get a random number of tickets.

816
01:14:16,937 --> 01:14:21,602
[SPEAKER_03]: The payout will increase per stage a possible jackpot of 1,000 tickets.

817
01:14:21,962 --> 01:14:22,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not here.

818
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:26,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Does your skill affect the amount of tickets you get at all?

819
01:14:26,146 --> 01:14:29,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just play DDR and gamble?

820
01:14:30,235 --> 01:14:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does, but then you also get a bonus amount at the end or something like that.

821
01:14:36,882 --> 01:14:46,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We started this show 23 years ago about a video game that has now literally become Gamble, Gamble, Gamble, Gamble, Die.

822
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:51,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That said... That's a Wonder Shows reference, people.

823
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,163
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had this back when we were playing DDR...

824
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:57,834
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have solved a lot of problems.

825
01:14:58,135 --> 01:15:03,586
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it would have given something for the babies to go stomp on instead of our... Yes, that's true.

826
01:15:03,606 --> 01:15:06,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, a game that we could get a lot of tickets from.

827
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:07,415
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

828
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:08,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a win-win.

829
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,363
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have all bought our Nintendo GameCubes with tickets.

830
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there it is.

831
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:18,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things have come full circle.

832
01:15:18,726 --> 01:15:20,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to check that out, it is location testing.

833
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:25,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long, but it's at round one in Puente Hills Mall.

834
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:26,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where it's location testing.

835
01:15:26,879 --> 01:15:30,145
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine within a couple months, it'll be everywhere.

836
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming to your round one near you.

837
01:15:32,955 --> 01:15:33,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

838
01:15:33,656 --> 01:15:34,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, probably.

839
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:37,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, the round ones, I wish they... I'm getting so lazy.

840
01:15:37,919 --> 01:15:40,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always like, I wish they'd build a round one in Sacramento.

841
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:42,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they'd build a round one in Sacramento.

842
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:43,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, they do.

843
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:45,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, but it's in Roseville.

844
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so far.

845
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:49,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they build one on the other side of town?

846
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Put one downtown or in Natomas.

847
01:15:53,273 --> 01:15:53,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

848
01:15:53,774 --> 01:15:58,398
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big old Macy's right by the arena that is no longer there.

849
01:15:58,478 --> 01:16:00,059
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a perfect spot for a round one.

850
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:00,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

851
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:24,702
[SPEAKER_03]: but no they won't do it because there's a punch bowl social already there which is a very very very similar thing but just with less games all right yeah yeah i know i know but to be fair a better brunch menu to be fair that's true they had really good brunch and and the alcohol comes in a punch bowl hence the name so there are there are pros and cons to be fair okay let's go

852
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob said brunch and I was like, let's go.

853
01:16:29,405 --> 01:16:34,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to our next segment, which is DarkSakura's walk down memory lane.

854
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:52,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

855
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:55,650
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

856
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,986
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great pick, DarkSakura.

857
01:16:58,006 --> 01:16:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you pick for our listeners tonight?

858
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:02,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Portopia!

859
01:17:02,874 --> 01:17:29,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Haha!

860
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:34,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's where the name came from.

861
01:17:35,354 --> 01:17:36,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with it.

862
01:17:37,578 --> 01:17:47,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you have to solve murder mysteries by going and looking for clues and exploration, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles.

863
01:17:47,594 --> 01:17:51,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a first-person perspective, non-linear, and an open world.

864
01:17:51,661 --> 01:18:01,176
[SPEAKER_01]: You have conversations with NPCs, branching dialogue choices, interrogations, plot twists, and again, non-linear storytelling.

865
01:18:01,156 --> 01:18:09,906
[SPEAKER_01]: The Famicom version also has a command menu system, point-and-click interface, and a 3D dungeon maze.

866
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:23,681
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very well-received series and quite influential on designers, specifically Kojima and Aonuma.

867
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway...

868
01:18:27,785 --> 01:18:31,211
[SPEAKER_01]: You have various events that are going to unfold.

869
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:35,659
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got still pictures with messages, you know, old school adventure game.

870
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:44,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And you interact with the game using a verb-noun parser, so you have to be very precise in typing your commands with the keyboard.

871
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:51,666
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, some people say that finding the words you need to type are part of the riddles to solve.

872
01:18:51,646 --> 01:18:58,277
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are sound effects but there's no music and a save function.

873
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:02,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said before you do have branching dialogue choices.

874
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:09,655
[SPEAKER_01]: The story develops through entering those commands and getting answers from either your sidekick or NPCs.

875
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:15,644
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can achieve your objectives at different times in different directions.

876
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:27,762
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very free that way and it's an open world and as you make your choices it determines dialogue and the order of events as well as getting alternative endings when you identify the culprit.

877
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:31,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Only one of the characters in the game is the true culprit.

878
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:41,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there are red herrings, you know, you can close the case with the wrong culprit and you will face criticism from the police chief and have to reopen the case.

879
01:19:42,772 --> 01:19:49,021
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a phone that you can dial any number which you need to contact NPCs.

880
01:19:50,443 --> 01:19:58,474
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have an inventory system that requires examination and collection of the items and you use this as evidence later in the game.

881
01:19:58,454 --> 01:20:05,046
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Famicom version, since there was no keyboard, you had the menu with 14 set commands.

882
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:22,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And this actually, you know, that system was in one of the later, I guess, kind of sequel games that Hori did called the Hokkaido Serial Murder Case, the Oktos Disappearance.

883
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:30,764
[SPEAKER_01]: which came out in 1984 and it was right in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia.

884
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:37,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a point and click interface that you could use as a command using your D-pad as a cursor.

885
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:40,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You look around for clues and hot spots.

886
01:20:40,713 --> 01:20:42,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Branching menu selections.

887
01:20:42,154 --> 01:20:43,655
[SPEAKER_01]: This is again the Famicom version.

888
01:20:44,176 --> 01:20:52,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Additional sequences, an underground dungeon maze that was very RPG-like in its style.

889
01:20:52,403 --> 01:21:02,223
[SPEAKER_01]: The story itself is fictional, but it's set in real Japanese cities, mainly Kobe.

890
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:14,327
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to their sequences in Kyoto and Sumoto, the president of a bank company, his name is Yamakawa Kozo,

891
01:21:14,307 --> 01:21:21,520
[SPEAKER_01]: is found dead by his secretary, Sawaki Fumie, inside a locked room in his mansion.

892
01:21:22,942 --> 01:21:27,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The signs look like Kozo stabbed himself, but the police still want an investigation.

893
01:21:28,452 --> 01:21:37,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Your detective you play is an unseen silent protagonist and is simply just called Boss.

894
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:45,102
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an assistant named Mano Yasuhiko, who is nicknamed Yasu, who is the only one who actually speaks and executes your commands.

895
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:47,327
[SPEAKER_01]: You have other characters.

896
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Yukiko.

897
01:21:50,453 --> 01:21:54,681
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the daughter of a man named Hirata.

898
01:21:54,921 --> 01:21:59,350
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Kozo's nephew and heir and Okoi, who is a dancer.

899
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:14,892
[SPEAKER_01]: and it goes on from there so the game was conceived in 1981 by Hori when he was 27 right after he bought his first computer and learned to program by modifying other games um

900
01:22:14,872 --> 01:22:36,745
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically he went from being influenced by other text adventure games and manga artists Chiba Tetsuya, Adachi Mitsuru and Otomo Katsuhiro and the game was built in basic so moving on from there was very innovative game in the in the genre

901
01:22:36,725 --> 01:22:58,294
[SPEAKER_01]: and it became very very popular so there were many various ports as I said there was the Famicom port in 1985 and it was the first adventure game to be released on the Famicom and it also was a collaboration between Hori and Nakamura Koichi of Chunsoft before Dragon Quest came out

902
01:22:58,628 --> 01:23:05,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Nakamura was 19 when the Famicom version was published.

903
01:23:08,701 --> 01:23:14,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the Famicom used a menu system from a follow-up game, Hokkaido Serial Murder Case.

904
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,856
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as...

905
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:33,767
[SPEAKER_01]: His system that he developed, he noted that the Famicom version for both Portopia and Hokkaido, that he wanted them to be appealing to a mature audience as opposed to the younger audience.

906
01:23:34,688 --> 01:23:38,391
[SPEAKER_01]: He was also playing Wizardry at the time, so that's why he put in the 3D dungeon maze.

907
01:23:39,592 --> 01:23:51,383
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never released in the West because of its mature content, which basically included themes like murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation, beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club.

908
01:23:51,363 --> 01:24:00,302
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of a Western release did lead to some ROM hacking groups, so there were unofficial translations for the Famicom.

909
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:07,718
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a mobile phone version of the game that was branded as part of the Horyuji Gekkijou,

910
01:24:07,698 --> 01:24:10,683
[SPEAKER_01]: as in Yuji Horii Theater.

911
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:20,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had mobile versions of the Hokkaido serial murder case and Karuizawa Yuki Anai.

912
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:24,909
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released in 2003 on EasyWeb and Yahoo!

913
01:24:24,929 --> 01:24:26,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Keitai Service.

914
01:24:26,412 --> 01:24:31,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It had mostly the Famicom system, but improved graphics, no free moving cursor.

915
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:34,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a save function.

916
01:24:36,481 --> 01:24:42,727
[SPEAKER_01]: The trilogy there was re-released in 2005-2006 on the same services.

917
01:24:42,747 --> 01:24:56,419
[SPEAKER_01]: The second Portopia version was basically just like the first of the mobile series, but also had updated graphics, background music, and a bonus function that you could get after completing the game, and a hint option.

918
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,878
[SPEAKER_01]: but it nullifies the ending bonus if you use it too much.

919
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:14,672
[SPEAKER_01]: The game also was featured as Square Enix's AI technology preview for GDC 2023 for natural language processing, including the functions like natural language understanding and natural language generation.

920
01:25:15,232 --> 01:25:25,807
[SPEAKER_01]: A public version was released worldwide on April 24, 2023 without the natural language generation features because they didn't want inappropriate content being created.

921
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:28,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't received very well.

922
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:49,272
[SPEAKER_01]: the Famicom version sold very well, 700,000 copies and they really liked the twist ending it was a game without a game over because there was technically no way to lose it was the first real detective adventure game according to Square Enix

923
01:25:49,403 --> 01:25:56,373
[SPEAKER_01]: and it influenced many later games including Metal Gear and Snatcher.

924
01:25:57,995 --> 01:26:09,150
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the PC-6001 version of Portopia was a Hidden Secret and Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain.

925
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:28,540
[SPEAKER_01]: it was one of the first games Aonuma ever played of course he went on to do the Legend of Zelda series starting with Ocarina of Time it had influenced games like Dragon Quest it influenced the whole visual novel genre in fact

926
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of different things.

927
01:26:30,402 --> 01:26:38,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It was ranked 19th in a poll to determine the 30 best Famicom games by the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2003.

928
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:44,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Retro Gaming Times Monthly even featured it.

929
01:26:44,339 --> 01:26:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an English language magazine.

930
01:26:46,162 --> 01:26:50,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And compared it to Shadowgate very similarly.

931
01:26:51,308 --> 01:26:57,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Other games, Deja Vu, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors,

932
01:26:57,055 --> 01:27:02,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Police Quest, Sherlock Holmes games, I mean, and even L.A.

933
01:27:02,053 --> 01:27:04,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Noire seemed to be influenced by the game.

934
01:27:05,124 --> 01:27:06,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there you go.

935
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:08,837
[SPEAKER_01]: The Portopia Serial Murder Case.

936
01:27:09,762 --> 01:27:10,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, alright.

937
01:27:10,984 --> 01:27:12,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a neat pick.

938
01:27:13,147 --> 01:27:15,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember anything like this ever being released over here.

939
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:17,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't.

940
01:27:17,793 --> 01:27:21,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it wasn't, but anything like it, even.

941
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:24,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe like a Shadowgate is the closest thing I can think of.

942
01:27:25,164 --> 01:27:35,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shadowgate was more fantasy, but it had some very similar... There's definitely a nod there, I'll put it that way.

943
01:27:35,218 --> 01:27:36,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.

944
01:27:37,381 --> 01:27:39,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, awesome pick.

945
01:27:39,277 --> 01:27:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

946
01:27:40,038 --> 01:27:45,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we are going to cover a few other headlines here real fast, and then we're going to get to the Lister Roundtable before too long.

947
01:27:45,525 --> 01:27:49,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we have emails tonight, which is funny because we had a couple last week, but not tonight.

948
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:54,476
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to send us emails for a future week, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.

949
01:27:55,196 --> 01:28:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also take calls potentially in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.

950
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:03,867

[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of updates on game projects and other things going on.

[SPEAKER_03]: Shmup away.

960
01:28:23,309 --> 01:28:23,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Shmup away.

961
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:27,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to Rapid Fire News.

962
01:28:27,623 --> 01:28:30,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a new Parodius game, please.

963
01:28:30,387 --> 01:28:36,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Check the Discord, because there was something announced this week at the Shum Shmup Fest or something.

964
01:28:37,798 --> 01:28:41,885
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like four YouTubes that they posted, and it's in there.

965
01:28:43,647 --> 01:28:44,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

966
01:28:44,228 --> 01:28:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

967
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:45,530
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

968
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:48,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some other headlines real quick.

969
01:28:48,234 --> 01:28:48,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

970
01:28:49,342 --> 01:28:59,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got word that there's going to be a new multiplayer mode added to the Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, the 4K remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.

971
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:06,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes sense because, you know, a lot has changed since back then with multiplayer.

972
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they have a brand new mode that takes place online.

973
01:29:10,335 --> 01:29:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Fox Hunt.

974
01:29:11,937 --> 01:29:38,822
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

975
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:42,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about this.

976
01:29:43,095 --> 01:29:47,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthion is coming to Switch on July 31st, 2025.

977
01:29:48,084 --> 01:29:50,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited Run Games put out a trailer for it.

978
01:29:50,448 --> 01:29:51,510
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks really fun.

979
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:58,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically an old, you know, kind of pixel game from Yuzo Koshiro.

980
01:29:59,364 --> 01:30:03,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music is great, and the game looks pretty, and I'm really looking forward to playing it.

981
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:06,822
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

982
01:30:06,922 --> 01:30:15,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And in sad news this week, it was brought to light that Masahiro Oki unfortunately passed away some time ago on October 6th of 2024.

983
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:21,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not recognize that name right off the bat, but they used a stage name that...

984
01:30:21,192 --> 01:30:31,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Benton Maru was the stage name used, and they were the composer of Edge of Soul, which of course was the iconic theme song for Soul Blade.

985
01:30:31,901 --> 01:30:36,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Benton Maru passed away back in 2024.

986
01:30:36,446 --> 01:30:42,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really, I mean, this was revealed by his wife on Facebook after a battle with illness.

987
01:30:42,591 --> 01:30:43,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else was really said there.

988
01:30:44,693 --> 01:30:50,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason why we're only finding out about this now is that the word traveled through a former band name, Mickey,

989
01:30:50,538 --> 01:30:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: who had, I guess, in interviews and comments had gotten the word out.

990
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:57,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of traveling around social media and gaming blogs this week.

991
01:30:57,908 --> 01:31:03,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, yeah, very, very epic gaming composer who has passed on.

992
01:31:03,855 --> 01:31:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So rest in peace.

993
01:31:05,197 --> 01:31:07,080
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a good song too.

994
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:09,543
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

995
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:14,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for some games coming out real soon.

996
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like, what year is this?

997
01:31:16,843 --> 01:31:22,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have Gex Trilogy coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

998
01:31:23,012 --> 01:31:27,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Loki, I have to interrupt because again, I'm watching this clusterfuck of a game behind you.

999
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this rally.

1000
01:31:29,002 --> 01:31:34,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this very obvious parody rally happening in this game behind you right now.

1001
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:35,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Help.

1002
01:31:35,553 --> 01:31:37,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Except this one's actually well attended.

1003
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:40,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Loki.

1004
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:45,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

1005
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, let's see.

1006
01:31:47,672 --> 01:31:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got, other than Gex Trilogy, a revival recolonization on Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1007
01:31:56,447 --> 01:32:01,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Date everything on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:02,517

1009
01:32:02,537 --> 01:32:02,918

01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:11,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play that.

1013

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1019
01:33:39,127 --> 01:33:41,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go over and check out some release dates in Japan.

1020
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:46,680
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to check out the Switch 2 starts us off this week.

1021
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:48,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing that Loki read in one of the U.S.

1022
01:33:48,864 --> 01:33:55,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan is also getting Raidou Remastered, The Mystery of the Soulless Army, which is an Atlus game that's getting a remaster, and that is coming to Switch 2.

1023
01:33:55,555 --> 01:34:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1024
01:34:15,822 --> 01:34:17,584
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that Cho Aniki series.

1025
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:19,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It sure is.

1026
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:22,269
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I have to point this out because this kind of cracks me up, all right?

1027
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:27,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on a popular retailer's website that imports a lot of games from Japan.

1028
01:34:27,555 --> 01:34:28,155
[SPEAKER_03]: It's PlayAsia.

1029
01:34:28,816 --> 01:34:32,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, here's the game, the Cho Aniki, and you can see all the screenshots and stuff.

1030
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,501
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not what I want to point out.

1031
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to point out is that they actually have an icon here.

1032
01:34:36,124 --> 01:34:38,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, not subject to U.S.

1033
01:34:38,346 --> 01:34:38,767
[SPEAKER_03]: tariffs.

1034
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:40,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So they let you know that the game is going to be $29.

1035
01:34:41,049 --> 01:34:42,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not subject to tariffs.

1036
01:34:42,871 --> 01:34:44,513
[SPEAKER_03]: But the way they market...

1037
01:34:44,493 --> 01:34:53,490
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1038
01:34:56,963 --> 01:34:57,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1039
01:34:58,145 --> 01:34:58,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

1040
01:34:58,685 --> 01:34:59,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Where were we?

1041
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Score one for PlayAsia.

1042
01:35:01,129 --> 01:35:03,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Hungry Meme is out this week as well.

1043
01:35:04,013 --> 01:35:07,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Toki no Kizuna for Nintendo Switch.

1044
01:35:07,738 --> 01:35:09,400
[SPEAKER_03]: If I said that already, sue me.

1045
01:35:10,282 --> 01:35:13,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Raidou Remastered is also on the original Switch as well.

1046

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we just have one news story for you left to go.

1066
01:37:08,788 --> 01:37:22,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to turn it over to Loki, but first I'm going to admit I purposely put this at the end of the show.

1067
01:37:23,886 --> 01:37:24,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm sick of this guy.

1068
01:37:25,648 --> 01:37:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's worth noting the update.

1069
01:37:28,651 --> 01:37:30,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So fine, Loki, take it away.

1070
01:37:31,572 --> 01:37:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had 1047 Games CEO and co-founder Ian Prolux talking about this whole make FPS great again hat debacle thing.

1071
01:37:45,934 --> 01:37:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise.

1072
01:37:49,966 --> 01:37:52,489
[SPEAKER_04]: and they didn't think it would really have an impact.

1073
01:37:52,509 --> 01:37:59,677
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he, of course, goes out to make a formal apology for doing this.

1074
01:37:59,737 --> 01:38:04,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, we did not intend for this to be taken political in any way whatsoever.

1075
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:05,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not an idiot.

1076
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, that's to be debated.

1077
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:11,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I knew there would be some level of controversy.

1078
01:38:11,391 --> 01:38:12,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hold on a second.

1079
01:38:12,452 --> 01:38:15,356
[SPEAKER_04]: You just said that there was not going to be any controversy.

1080
01:38:15,756 --> 01:38:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you just said.

1081
01:38:17,708 --> 01:38:19,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're saying that there was going to be controversy?

1082
01:38:20,773 --> 01:38:22,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, interesting.

1083
01:38:22,256 --> 01:38:33,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, we are disappointed with the state of the genre, and so we took it as a meme and thought it would be not nearly as received the way it was.

1084
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:37,501
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, like, upset at the state of the genre?

1085
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Because your game's not really pushing anything.

1086
01:38:40,186 --> 01:39:08,387
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1087
01:39:08,367 --> 01:39:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: NanoSwarm NanoSwarm NanoSwarm

1088
01:39:27,031 --> 01:39:29,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say, the $80 video game, here we are.

1089
01:39:29,594 --> 01:39:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: $80, and then of course people started asking us.

1090
01:39:33,758 --> 01:39:34,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a skin pack.

1091
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so what's going on?

1092
01:39:36,181 --> 01:39:39,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a lot of people ask me, how the hell did this happen in the first place?

1093
01:39:39,945 --> 01:39:42,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an $80 bundle, that's not the 1047 way.

1094
01:39:43,089 --> 01:39:46,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, and I thought I would just candidly tell you exactly what happened.

1095
01:39:46,973 --> 01:39:54,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll start by saying, no excuse of course, I should have been on this, and we should have been on top of this.

1096
01:39:54,942 --> 01:40:00,449
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, as the CEO of this company, not aware of what's going on in your own company?

1097
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:05,876
[SPEAKER_04]: The second I got off stage, I called Derek, our lead game designer, and I said, Derek, what did you do?

1098
01:40:06,216 --> 01:40:14,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The second he got off stage, if he knew about it, if he didn't know about it, then he couldn't have made that call the second he got off the stage.

1099
01:40:15,268 --> 01:40:21,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the second he got off the stage, maybe he was told about it, and then two seconds after he got off the stage, he could have made the call.

1100
01:40:21,536 --> 01:40:23,498
[SPEAKER_03]: But the math ain't mathin', buddy.

1101
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:25,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, as well, did you know we had an $80 bundle?

1102
01:40:25,676 --> 01:40:26,798
[SPEAKER_04]: This sounds like news to me.

1103
01:40:27,139 --> 01:40:29,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, you are the CEO of your company.

1104
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:33,474
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that you don't know what's going on in your company about their game... You have to sign off on this shit.

1105
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you have to sign off on this stuff.

1106
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:36,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how did you not know this was happening?

1107
01:40:37,624 --> 01:40:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1108
01:40:38,497 --> 01:40:40,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't make any sense whatsoever.

1109
01:40:40,138 --> 01:40:48,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially what happened is our former head of monetization who happens to come from Call of Duty Okay, well Call of Duty is not a company.

1110
01:40:48,326 --> 01:40:49,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty is a game, sir.

1111
01:40:50,988 --> 01:40:54,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Was with us for less than a year and was very aggressive on price.

1112
01:40:54,591 --> 01:41:00,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually prior to his departure, originally had a founder's pack for $100 and battle passes for $10.

1113
01:41:00,176 --> 01:41:04,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first thing that Derek and I did when we re-evaluated the game.

1114
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:06,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put the blame on other people.

1115
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:07,142
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1116
01:41:07,162 --> 01:41:08,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in the industry knows.

1117
01:41:08,483 --> 01:41:31,015
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy will throw you under the bus.

1118
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:34,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you're an idiot.

1119
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:36,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't understand.

1120
01:41:36,604 --> 01:41:38,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically it says, yeah, it fell through the cracks somehow.

1121
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:43,695
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it fall through the cracks when you just said that you were evaluating these prices a month ago?

1122
01:41:43,715 --> 01:41:47,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how are you unaware of it if you were aware of it a month ago?

1123
01:41:47,161 --> 01:41:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make any sense.

1124
01:41:51,464 --> 01:41:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you just did the thing, people got angry at you, and now you're trying to save face because your game sucks.

1125
01:41:56,971 --> 01:42:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to blame all of the people in the room that came up with this idea or whatever.

1126
01:42:01,656 --> 01:42:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to blame the person with the pricing.

1127
01:42:03,819 --> 01:42:11,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to blame... Did he, and maybe I missed it, did he blame himself in any of this?

1128
01:42:11,288 --> 01:42:11,588
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1129
01:42:11,668 --> 01:42:15,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he says... I'll start by saying...

1130
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,098
[SPEAKER_04]: No excuse, of course.

1131
01:42:17,238 --> 01:42:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have been on this.

1132
01:42:19,024 --> 01:42:20,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have been on top of this.

1133
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:21,472
[SPEAKER_04]: No excuse.

1134
01:42:22,255 --> 01:42:24,803
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have some excuses ready to go.

1135
01:42:25,486 --> 01:42:26,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some excuses.

1136
01:42:27,273 --> 01:42:31,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I called it no excuse, so therefore those aren't excuses.

1137
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say this.

1138
01:42:35,484 --> 01:42:43,475
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, while I blame the guy, he had a whole staff idea tank who also backed him on this bad idea.

1139
01:42:43,695 --> 01:42:47,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I want to ask one question.

1140
01:42:47,501 --> 01:42:48,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Ian, are you out there?

1141
01:42:48,202 --> 01:42:50,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a fan of Orange Launch Radio?

1142
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:54,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to guess probably not, but yeah, let's just pretend for a minute.

1143
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:55,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Ian's listening to the show.

1144
01:42:55,593 --> 01:42:58,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we have found out, other CEOs apparently do listen to the show.

1145
01:42:59,161 --> 01:43:00,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens.

1146
01:43:00,123 --> 01:43:02,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to have a conversation with Ian real quick.

1147
01:43:02,207 --> 01:43:05,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to ask you, Ian, I want to ask you one question.

1148
01:43:05,835 --> 01:43:06,396
[SPEAKER_03]: One question.

1149
01:43:06,777 --> 01:43:07,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing.

1150
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:09,904
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to answer this question.

1151
01:43:09,924 --> 01:43:10,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't.

1152
01:43:10,966 --> 01:43:12,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to answer this question.

1153
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:14,053
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to ask it anyway.

1154
01:43:15,063 --> 01:43:28,219
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were in that room coming up with this great idea, really novel idea on how to be so edgy at Summer Games Fest on how to stick out with this game.

1155
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:39,653
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were in the room with all of those people coming up with this idea, was everybody else in the room with you a cis, hetero, white guy of similar upbringing?

1156
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:42,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they conscious?

1157
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't expect an answer to that question.

1158
01:43:46,794 --> 01:43:48,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would like you to stew on that for a little bit.

1159
01:43:48,776 --> 01:43:49,157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1160
01:43:49,497 --> 01:43:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the answer would surprise me, in fact.

1161
01:43:53,141 --> 01:43:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would also then ask the follow-up question of how much did you listen?

1162
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:04,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all I'm going to say.

1163
01:44:04,254 --> 01:44:06,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of listening... Was he even actually there?

1164
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: well here's the funny the funny part about that like just real real fast like we know well like we don't have to have you make excuses about why it's $8 you made it $8 because you're trying to attract whales to your game and you want them to drop $80 on this when you have done nothing to sell people that this is even worth $80 worth of game like it's just it's stupid

1165
01:44:33,802 --> 01:44:40,749
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on and let's take a second to listen to our listeners as they interact with us every week.

1166
01:44:40,769 --> 01:44:42,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have an email, so I stand corrected.

1167
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:46,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Participate at OrangetonTrader.com is the place to send those emails.

1168
01:44:46,295 --> 01:44:49,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura is going to jump in.

1169
01:44:49,498 --> 01:44:51,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say one email?

1170
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:53,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I said two emails.

1171
01:44:53,362 --> 01:44:53,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

1172
01:44:53,883 --> 01:44:54,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Ho, ho.

1173
01:44:55,284 --> 01:44:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, for once.

1174
01:44:57,366 --> 01:44:59,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start off with the first one.

1175
01:44:59,268 --> 01:45:01,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just worried these are the same two.

1176
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:01,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1177
01:45:02,168 --> 01:45:09,795
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're two different... Wait, wait, did you not remove, clean out the mailbox?

1178
01:45:09,815 --> 01:45:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Not always.

1179
01:45:10,836 --> 01:45:11,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob!

1180
01:45:12,777 --> 01:45:13,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1181
01:45:14,779 --> 01:45:16,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1182
01:45:16,321 --> 01:45:18,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look at the calendar, because we may still be in luck.

1183
01:45:18,763 --> 01:45:19,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1184
01:45:20,104 --> 01:45:25,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you read one from... The last show was six... Eight was the last show.

1185
01:45:26,269 --> 01:45:30,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and did you read one from a UK listener?

1186
01:45:31,014 --> 01:45:31,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1187
01:45:33,151 --> 01:45:51,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for emailing us, people.

1188
01:45:51,298 --> 01:45:52,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do it again.

1189
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And Carl, hi.

1190
01:45:55,122 --> 01:46:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S is asking me, so DJ Ranma S sent me a care package this week, which had some fun treats.

1191
01:46:03,264 --> 01:46:04,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the funny thing.

1192
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a box and it came.

1193
01:46:05,871 --> 01:46:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1194
01:46:08,403 --> 01:46:09,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have something to add to that.

1195
01:46:09,765 --> 01:46:11,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a box that came from Japan.

1196
01:46:11,587 --> 01:46:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I opened it, it was like Hershey's Oreo-ish looking cookies, we'll say for lack of a better term.

1197
01:46:17,613 --> 01:46:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, neat.

1198
01:46:18,975 --> 01:46:20,216
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent cookies from Japan.

1199
01:46:20,256 --> 01:46:20,697
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

1200
01:46:21,277 --> 01:46:24,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I have diabetes.

1201
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:30,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really eat a lot of cookies, but I will save one for a special occasion when I'm going to be exercising after or something like that.

1202
01:46:30,948 --> 01:46:34,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he was like, open the box when Alan gets home.

1203
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:35,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what?

1204
01:46:35,597 --> 01:46:38,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I opened his, oh, it's not just cookies in here.

1205
01:46:38,662 --> 01:46:42,590
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually little rainbow Star Trek comm badge pins, which are super adorable.

1206
01:46:42,610 --> 01:46:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very thankful for that.

1207
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:47,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there actually, there was one cookie package still in there.

1208
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:50,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan ate it, but said it was good.

1209
01:46:50,945 --> 01:47:16,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I were really excited by our gift because we have a little UFO catcher Ryoga and Ukyo from Ranma Nibunouchi.

1210
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:17,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

1211
01:47:17,544 --> 01:47:17,644
Yeah.

1212
01:47:18,248 --> 01:47:44,863
[SPEAKER_01]: when Dan and I were first friends online I had the screen named Dark Ukyo or Dark Uchan for a while and he had Dark Ryoga that's so adorable I'm gonna barf and they are still in my heart the OTP they should have ended up together and my headcanon says they did alright, fair enough

1213
01:47:45,873 --> 01:47:49,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's do some last minute stories here.

1214
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:53,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have one I'd like to get into because I just found this one.

1215
01:47:54,447 --> 01:47:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and this is, it's a little different.

1216
01:47:56,009 --> 01:48:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a last minute story so much as it is, here I go again, get my soapbox, get it, because I gotta call somebody out, okay?

1217
01:48:04,823 --> 01:48:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's who I'm calling out and why.

1218
01:48:06,585 --> 01:48:13,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So I came across this headline, and it's from the website PC Gamer, which is usually a website that I'm pretty into.

1219
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the headline.

1220
01:48:15,816 --> 01:48:17,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, games fans.

1221
01:48:17,618 --> 01:48:25,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Enter the early stages of Silksong Syndrome after Light No Fire is a summer game fest no-show.

1222
01:48:25,468 --> 01:48:31,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes on to talk about how in 2023 the game was announced, all this stuff.

1223
01:48:31,435 --> 01:48:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you know where I'm going with this.

1224
01:48:33,579 --> 01:48:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fucking dangerous what you're doing.

1225
01:48:35,422 --> 01:48:35,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

1226
01:48:36,644 --> 01:48:37,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

1227
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:38,928
[SPEAKER_03]: This is dangerous what you're doing.

1228
01:48:39,208 --> 01:48:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Because literally, this tells me, do you have amnesia as to what happened with No Man's Sky?

1229
01:48:47,502 --> 01:48:55,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you forget what happened in that situation and how we got to that situation?

1230
01:48:55,516 --> 01:49:09,087
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was that massive hype machine building up towards a game that did not meet the hype machine that caused that game to have issues that we are still talking about years after its release.

1231
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me?

1232
01:49:11,342 --> 01:49:16,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to run this headline about this studio after that experience?

1233
01:49:16,749 --> 01:49:27,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be quite frank, I don't think you should be running a headline like this on any studio because this is just going to discourage game makers to finish.

1234
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:30,309
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to finish games before putting them out.

1235
01:49:32,111 --> 01:49:33,273
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?

1236
01:49:33,293 --> 01:49:33,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

1237
01:49:36,050 --> 01:49:37,875
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no story here.

1238
01:49:37,995 --> 01:49:41,204
[SPEAKER_03]: The story is there were no announcements.

1239
01:49:41,224 --> 01:49:43,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So we always joke about an announcement of an announcement.

1240
01:49:44,052 --> 01:49:45,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now here we go.

1241
01:49:45,115 --> 01:49:47,140
[SPEAKER_03]: An announcement of no announcements.

1242
01:49:48,301 --> 01:49:50,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them fucking cook their game.

1243
01:49:51,225 --> 01:49:54,809
[SPEAKER_03]: When it is done and in a state you can see it, you will see it.

1244
01:49:55,490 --> 01:50:06,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that Silksong is a meme for all other sorts of reasons, and Microsoft's kind of feeding that one, but for what it's worth, the same rules apply.

1245
01:50:07,125 --> 01:50:09,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave them alone.

1246
01:50:09,128 --> 01:50:12,452
[SPEAKER_03]: They will give you the information when the game is ready.

1247
01:50:13,934 --> 01:50:21,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt says you're tanking a game just for the sake of you wanting to get into Silksong News search lines.

1248
01:50:21,923 --> 01:50:22,743
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

1249
01:50:22,764 --> 01:50:26,968
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a website that usually does better and I expect to do better.

1250
01:50:27,789 --> 01:50:28,570
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crap.

1251
01:50:31,393 --> 01:50:32,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my last minute story.

1252
01:50:32,474 --> 01:50:34,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you have something more positive, Loki.

1253
01:50:35,537 --> 01:50:36,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nothing.

1254
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll leave it on a ranty note.

1255
01:50:41,069 --> 01:50:49,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just trying to remember all the bookmarking stuff or wishlisting stuff on Steam just as part of NexFest going on right now.

1256
01:50:50,608 --> 01:50:53,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw that the demo for Dispatch came out and that looks awesome.

1257
01:50:53,574 --> 01:50:54,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1258
01:50:54,676 --> 01:50:55,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that one?

1259
01:50:55,618 --> 01:50:55,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1260
01:50:55,999 --> 01:50:58,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you're dispatching superheroes?

1261
01:50:58,163 --> 01:51:14,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see if you can still sign up for that game that looked like Clue or Knives Out I want to see if that one had a demo because Square Enix sent an email on that I want to see if we can still get into that and then that Mixtape game

1262
01:51:14,701 --> 01:51:15,462
[SPEAKER_03]: looked really neat.

1263
01:51:15,482 --> 01:51:16,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see if there's a demo for that.

1264
01:51:16,844 --> 01:51:17,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks good.

1265
01:51:18,407 --> 01:51:21,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, what was the other two that I just bookmarked?

1266
01:51:21,852 --> 01:51:23,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Neon Inferno.

1267
01:51:23,475 --> 01:51:24,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely look that up.

1268
01:51:24,536 --> 01:51:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a Contra-looking game.

1269
01:51:26,299 --> 01:51:27,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks amazing.

1270
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:34,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Space Adventure Cobra, which is done in a style of some 80s anime type thing.

1271
01:51:35,032 --> 01:51:36,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's an actual anime.

1272
01:51:36,294 --> 01:51:37,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Cobra is an 80s anime.

1273
01:51:38,498 --> 01:51:41,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really badass.

1274
01:51:41,202 --> 01:51:41,282
Yes.

1275
01:51:41,431 --> 01:51:58,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Cobra, Urasayatsura

1276
01:52:00,787 --> 01:52:01,888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1277
01:52:01,908 --> 01:52:05,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with all that news, we are at the end of the show.

1278
01:52:05,492 --> 01:52:07,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to thank everybody for listening to our program.

1279
01:52:08,255 --> 01:52:10,558
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1280
01:52:10,578 --> 01:52:20,990
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're feeling so generous, a nice five-star review on a site where you found this podcast, such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show, all of that love goes an extra long way to helping grow our audience.

1281
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:22,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1282
01:52:22,631 --> 01:52:26,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1283
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:29,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really appreciate that.

1284
01:52:29,339 --> 01:52:34,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, as always, for being here live or on the podcast, however you listen to the show.

1285
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:34,685
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you.

1286
01:52:35,046 --> 01:52:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Reminder, we're not here next week, so we'll see you once again on June 29th, where we will be celebrating turning 23 years old as a show, if you can believe it or not.

1287
01:52:45,578 --> 01:52:46,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1288
01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:49,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I might do some Claire Obscure next week.

1289
01:52:49,022 --> 01:52:49,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, fun.

1290
01:52:50,043 --> 01:52:51,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like when the show would usually be on?

1291
01:52:52,289 --> 01:52:55,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or maybe as Nick says, wee-wee baguette.

1292
01:52:55,233 --> 01:52:56,675
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1293
01:52:57,917 --> 01:52:58,678
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it for the show.

1294
01:52:58,718 --> 01:52:59,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get final thoughts.

1295
01:52:59,759 --> 01:53:01,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, I assume you're going to stream.

1296
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,102
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you streaming tonight?

1297
01:53:02,182 --> 01:53:03,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to do Debbie or you going to play something?

1298
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mass Effect.

1299
01:53:04,105 --> 01:53:05,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass Effect, cool.

1300
01:53:05,086 --> 01:53:07,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass Effect is much easier for me to do with this short time.

1301
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:09,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only get a couple of games in on DVD.

1302
01:53:10,253 --> 01:53:20,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mass Effect is easy for me to find like a pausing spot, you know, instead of, do I want to do one more game and then have it be a Legion match that lasts five hours?

1303
01:53:20,247 --> 01:53:21,048
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1304
01:53:21,088 --> 01:53:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thought tonight.

1305
01:53:23,187 --> 01:53:26,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no kings, just queens.

1306
01:53:28,279 --> 01:53:28,600
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1307
01:53:29,162 --> 01:53:30,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, DarkSakura.

1308
01:53:30,806 --> 01:53:31,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

1309
01:53:31,547 --> 01:53:31,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

1310
01:53:32,911 --> 01:53:34,495
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, we'll go over to you then.

1311
01:53:34,555 --> 01:53:36,319
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your final thought for tonight?

1312
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:40,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I did have a technically last minute story.

1313
01:53:40,716 --> 01:53:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Real fast, I was going to say, Stellar Blades sold 1 million copies on PC, which is amazing.

1314
01:53:45,823 --> 01:53:55,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think because of that game selling so well, they've also removed the region restrictions for the other games that required Sony online logins, that type of thing.

1315
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:58,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1316
01:53:58,642 --> 01:53:58,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

1317
01:54:00,203 --> 01:54:02,746
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought for tonight is happy Pride.

1318
01:54:03,487 --> 01:54:15,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I marched in the Pride Parade today with the local horror cult movie contingent, like Rocky Horror and stuff, and I was handing out flyers for a show next week, which sadly I'm not even going to, but I want them to be successful.

1319
01:54:15,718 --> 01:54:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I do, because we're going to have a Halloween show, and I've loved this group for a long time.

1320
01:54:19,742 --> 01:54:22,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I was happy to be in the Pride Parade today and see so many people turn out.

1321
01:54:23,005 --> 01:54:26,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So it made my heart full of rainbows.

1322
01:54:26,148 --> 01:54:27,971
[SPEAKER_03]: and May Your Heart Be Full of Rainbows as well.

1323
01:54:28,031 --> 01:54:29,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a wonderful week, everybody.

1324
01:54:29,533 --> 01:54:30,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a wonderful two weeks.

1325
01:54:30,835 --> 01:54:35,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you back here in two weeks for our next show on June 20th.

1326
01:54:35,122 --> 01:54:36,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I say 26th, I meant 29th.

1327
01:54:36,624 --> 01:54:38,186
[SPEAKER_03]: June 29th will be our next show.

1328
01:54:38,206 --> 01:54:40,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 15 plus 14 is nine.

1329
01:54:40,570 --> 01:54:42,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will see you on June 29th.

1330
01:54:42,713 --> 01:54:44,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, have a wonderful week, everybody.

1331
01:54:45,157 --> 01:54:46,259
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you next time.

1332
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:46,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1333
01:54:49,183 --> 01:54:51,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1334
01:54:53,519 --> 01:55:22,092
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week.
