10105	14612	Builder Rocket Boy's debut title, Mind's Eye, has released a critical WTS.
14633	20743	The game with a 10-year plan now rests on the credentials of a former GTA producer being able to pull the rabbit out of the flaming hat.
20763	22445	Daikatana, eat your heart out.
22846	27975	I'm sad for the engineers who had to crunch to get the game out the door, now have to crunch to get the game up to some definition of par.
28536	33584	Now it's time for your hosts, Shrub Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
33604	36028	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39232	46082	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46102	56356	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again June the 15th of 2025 with episode number 1051 of our show.
56376	61543	Here with you every week on Sunday nights live and throughout the week on our podcast available worldwide.
61523	64648	wherever your fine podcasts are downloaded.
64908	65830	I am Rob Roberts.
65850	66892	I'm here with you every week.
66912	74404	And my co-hosts, both with me back this week, no nights off tonight, say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
76026	77248	My defense, I was dancing.
77609	78470	I know, I know.
78611	81575	And to be fair, I'm the one missing next week, but we'll get into that a little bit.
81595	83318	So it's a busy time here.
83378	84180	I'm also missing, technically.
84460	85201	Are you?
85221	85482	Oh, are you?
85742	86844	Techmaster Loki, hello.
86864	88206	You're missing as well.
88338	89719	I would be missing as well, yes.
89779	90280	That's right.
90300	91321	So it's summer.
91421	92181	Things are going on.
92261	93222	Things are exciting.
93542	95164	Well, DarkSakura, you weren't here last week.
95184	96765	What was exciting for you in the last couple weeks?
99067	99768	I was dancing.
100128	100989	That's right, dancing.
101469	102250	I'm dancing.
102270	103110	I'm dancing.
103251	109276	We had a ballet recital, and then it went really well.
109436	110637	It looked really, really good.
111418	117102	We had issues with our cloaks for our first number, but the rest of it was okay.
117122	117923	We did our best.
118122	118623	That's okay.
118663	123048	I bet nobody noticed except you guys who know what's supposed to happen.
123068	124430	There are a few people who said something.
124670	127894	Do you videotape it and watch it back later?
129876	130277	I don't.
130437	131058	Other people did.
132560	135804	Nobody in my group ever goes.
136865	141931	I get asked a lot with this podcast, do you listen to your own show?
141951	144214	And I'm like, hmm...
144397	146299	It depends.
146319	148341	Like, you know, I'm here.
148401	149381	I get to hear it live.
149762	152164	So I don't usually listen to the recording.
152184	159150	But sometimes I'm kind of like, I wonder how a certain bit sort of came across, you know, or how it kind of might sound.
159190	160852	So once in a while, I'll listen to it.
160872	161612	But I don't.
162193	166377	It's funny because people will be telling me that something happened on a certain episode.
166417	172362	And I'm like, I don't remember what happened last week, to be quite honest.
172342	195261	Loki, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
195241	204073	It's only the incredibly polished AAA, why I would say maybe even quadruple A game known as Mind's Eye.
204093	205455	Oh, is this Mind's Eye?
205475	211564	See, I know very little about this game, but I know it's all over the news this week and we'll get into that a little later.
212345	215990	Oh boy, have you played this at all or just experienced the memes?
216010	216591	I have not.
217010	218454	Picking it up.
218474	229685	I do kind of I do kind of want to play because it sounds like Saints Row in the sense that it's buggy as hell, but like in some hilarious ways, but also in some non-hilarious ways.
229706	230387	So I don't know.
230588	232032	Is it like it?
232012	233294	Looks very Grand Theft Auto.
233314	246598	Like I would say when I look at the game, like just the movement of the characters and how like they kind of interact with things reminds me a lot of Grand Theft Auto, which I mean makes sense because it's Leslie Benzies who was a producer of Grand Theft Auto.
246618	250425	So yeah.
251367	258393	It's another Mighty No.
258413	281374	9
281354	303075	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
303055	304778	They don't get into a lot of details.
304798	310328	They just say there is a tentative detail for a new interactive media agreement with major video game companies.
310348	319545	And in a union statement, they say, pursuant to the authority previously delegated by the national board with the advance and consent of the IMA negotiating committee, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
319525	340268	Thank you for watching.
340248	341890	on productions under the IMA.
341910	350863	So, you know, especially big companies, Activision, Disney, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, and so on, will be able to go back to work.
351785	355790	So that's great news to hear that this has all finally come to a close.
355810	360277	Of course, we still have a lot of questions.
360337	362881	And Bobby says, did Variety say it was ended or was suspended?
362961	363842	Sorry, it's...
363822	369528	It is suspended pending that agreement, but it is looking like it will end.
369708	374112	It's going to take a lot at this point for it to be held up.
374132	383601	It would basically take a rejection of that vote for this to not end, which seeing as they are recommending that vote in a yes is very unlikely.
383862	389307	And folks are able to return to work, which is also an important thing to note with that.
389907	390488	Now...
391514	400390	It's interesting, the timing, because to me, this goes back to, and this was something we said when Darth Vader was in Fortnite.
400550	413573	I recall saying very explicitly when there were those clips within 15 minutes of Darth Vader AI going live in Fortnite and James Earl Jones having racial slurs, homophobic slurs.
413553	420081	Any shitty thing an internet person is going to make a person they have control over say was said within 15 minutes.
420141	424726	And granted, they did their best to patch that all out as fast as they can.
424746	432896	But I believe I said something to the effect of they just handed SAG-AFTRA the biggest bargaining chip in these negotiations.
432916	437862	SAG-AFTRA can walk into that room Monday morning and go, what the fuck?
437882	439864	This is why we're demanding AI protections.
442392	463793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
463908	470959	Darth Vader in Fortnite, and all the shitty things the internet made poor James Earl Jones do, may he rest in peace.
472301	480994	All those things brought a lot of awareness to how AI can actually not be a good thing in a lot of circumstances, especially with open borders, be that as it may.
481074	487063	Now, as a reminder, and before I get corrected on it, SAG-AFTRA did already call out, well,
487043	515025	and DarkSakura.
515005	521351	Robin Williams was not able to provide the voice of the genie, and that was due to a dispute issue in the beginning, I believe, with Disney.
522171	527036	Dan Castaneda, I believe, from The Simpsons, did the genie in a couple of the sequels.
527056	528837	And then Robin Williams came back, and it was a big deal.
528857	534222	But voice parts do get handed off, so do we fucking need AI to do it?
534582	534883	No.
535343	537485	We can have other actors play the parts.
537505	543190	And that, SAG-AFTRA had already taken issue to, and then here we are a
543170	546160	We have the official tentative agreement.
546578	574560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
574540	579205	and so Mass Effect was the only thing we could not advertise as Mass Effect.
579646	582149	Was it Mass Effect or Dragon Age?
582169	585393	It was Mass Effect because those were the voice actors that we had at the time.
586133	594223	Remember, Dragon Con's a little more about celebrating the culture as opposed to hyping upcoming things, so we were not hyping Dragon Age at that time.
594523	597747	I don't think the voice actor cast was known that...
597727	623464	Carameldansen
624052	632923	Anyway, but excited to hear that the strike is finally getting resolved and it's very interesting the timing of it all.
632943	646421	So we may inevitably actually be thanking Fortnite for bringing awareness to this issue of what bullshit is possible with AI having completely open borders on people's talent and likeness and things like that.
646881	647562	So...
647542	648064	We'll see.
648304	652116	Yeah, SJ100Math in our chat says, I imagine they won't say anything for a bit.
652197	654524	Gotta wait for the agreement to be final final.
654925	658737	Yes, it's gotta be approved by the union insiders.
659038	661686	It's gotta be done, done, done.
662206	663768	More to come on that in the coming weeks.
663788	670077	Okay, sorry about that, but it was an important thing to put out there because we just said it as recent as last week.
670418	671920	The strike is still going on.
672240	675044	It's nice to be able to say maybe not so much now.
675064	680933	Finally, we're making some progress on some fair agreements for our hardworking voice actors.
680953	686020	I would not believe the number of AI signs, though, I saw online.
686000	689107	Really?
689868	694518	Oh.
694638	696121	Oh no.
696903	702996	Oh no.
703415	709544	Well, the, you know, I saw some footage from the event that was going on in Washington, D.C.
709844	712308	Because obviously a lot of people had had some things to say about that.
712829	715212	And I couldn't help but notice... Nothing happened in Washington, D.C.
715393	717135	Nothing important happened in Washington, D.C.
717776	721502	I happened to notice a woman was wearing a shirt that was talking.
721602	723204	It said something, the big, beautiful military.
723224	724306	And it was an AI logo.
724326	726729	And I was like, that's what we've resorted to?
727110	730195	As like, oh my God, it's just, it's wild.
730735	731897	An everything computer.
732478	732578	Yeah.
732912	735195	Good thing nothing happened.
735215	737058	I love a homemade protest sign.
737479	744008	I didn't see one that my pal Aria Snark, Victoria, made for when she went in LA.
744609	751018	And she made a sign that said, May I remind you that it does not say RSVP on the Statue of Liberty.
751038	754022	And it was written and it had Alicia Silverstone from Clueless in the corner.
754042	755304	Because that's what the quote is from.
755324	755925	Alicia Silverstone.
755945	756846	And it had the Statue of Liberty.
756886	759129	And it looked like a magazine collage.
759149	761653	And I was like, I love me a homemade sign.
761633	785329	because that's it's great so anyway I saw a Bianca Del Rio face in front of me just the eyes and mouth that just said not today Satan that's good and a new friend that we made there had a very tiny tiny little sign and it says a tiny sign for a light tiny man that's good that's good
785528	786449	I love protest signs.
786469	791136	I'm sad I wasn't able to do it, but my sister was in town yesterday, so we did Father's Day a little bit early.
791216	799689	So yeah, but I enjoyed seeing all the footage of so many people at those events, and then the little tires squeaking at the other event.
799929	801031	It's pretty great.
801912	802673	There was no other event.
802693	803434	What are you talking about?
803555	804216	I know, I know.
804236	810485	All right, let's get into other gaming news we want to talk about at the top of the show here that I'm not injecting at the last minute.
810545	811266	Loki.
812242	840865	yes let's talk about Sony and all of their accolades so I guess they must have had an investors meeting recently but there's a lot of different comments regarding their strategy coming out so of course it makes perfect sense Sony gonna double down on those live service games they are not to be perturbed by the failure of Concord they still are hoping that of course uh
841334	844319	You know, something to the effect of Marathon is going to do really well.
844820	849287	The problem with that, though, is it hasn't really been received all that well.
849408	853374	And, I mean, stolen art and all that stuff as well.
854176	854777	So, I don't know.
855378	860406	It's interesting, but the kind of outside of the kind of canned...
861905	887541	Corpo speak it sounds like the game's probably gonna be delayed again um and it probably should be because I think it needs a lot more polish to make it something unique and something actually people want um along with that of course the whole reason that they're trying to use their internal studios to create these large titles that are trying to pull people to the platform is they're kind of going the opposite strategy of Microsoft in the sense that they don't really see
887521	915199	PC, etc.
915432	923084	which I understand that but I think people have also realized that you can probably just wait for some of this stuff.
923104	935723	Do we really need to have the FOMO of purchasing a $600 console plus these $80 games and all that for what may be something you can play on PC if you have a PC?
936324	936725	I don't know.
938387	942874	But yes, definitely they recognize how popular they are but
943917	955497	they're not going to basically publish day and date with PC because they don't want to lose that edge that they have with these exclusive titles and
955797	959801	along with that, of course, they are doing really well as it is.
960081	965125	They have had the most profitable generation so far in the PlayStation lifetime.
965606	969790	It has been more profitable than the PlayStation 1, 2, 3, and 4 combined.
970270	971011	Wow.
971031	973053	And yeah, their revenue is up.
973073	976876	Well, when you charge $70 for a video game, you're going to make a lot more money, aren't you?
977296	985804	Yeah, their revenue is up and operating income is also up as well, which also kind of, it's a little bit of a head scratcher with some news we'll have later on that like
985784	989507	Okay, so then why are you still laying off people?
991109	1006062	If your revenue and your income is that high, I mean, we're talking about $13 billion versus the last highest generation was the previous generation, which was $9 billion operating income, so that's beyond all the actual cost.
1006082	1009385	They needed just that little bit more to build their new summer home.
1012027	1013068	Unfortunately, correct.
1013088	1015150	How many summer homes do we really need?
1015349	1016410	There's only one summer?
1016551	1018033	How do you travel to all these homes?
1018153	1019355	Climate change, Loki.
1019375	1023020	We have to keep moving the summer home because it keeps getting hotter and hotter.
1023080	1035537	I see in the chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Mike Deft says it was over 110 degrees Fahrenheit during the whole weekend, which is why they didn't protest down there in his area, even in other countries in Mexico.
1035638	1036699	But, yeah.
1038012	1046362	Yeah, so like basically, I don't necessarily feel bad for these companies, but I think that right now Marathon doesn't stand.
1046922	1052709	It's not in a really good, have a good footing for jumping into the market right now.
1052749	1053870	It's not unique enough.
1053930	1056173	It looks extremely generic.
1056593	1065724	So I'm thinking that they may just have to delay that a little bit longer to give it some personality because otherwise they're going to launch it and it's going to fail again.
1065907	1066809	I don't know.
1068212	1075147	In the words of the great Alyssa Edwards, global drag queen phenomenon, I smell a stunt.
1075427	1082081	I feel like what's going to happen with Marathon is you're going to see some type of stunt to try to make it really stand out.
1082101	1085248	And by that, I'm thinking – let me give you an example.
1085228	1091219	Keanu Reeves coming out on the stage and announcing that he's in Cyberpunk 2077 and being a character in that.
1091440	1105086	I think it's going to take some type of like stunt casting like that or some type of – because I don't know what within the game we get people talking as much as like a potential like celebrity that no one expects to be in a game.
1105567	1105667	Yeah.
1105647	1109473	Remember when Peter Dinklage was going to be the voice of whatever the hell that character is?
1109493	1111737	Yeah, and they completely erased him out because he was terrible.
1111877	1118227	And then they erased that, and that wasn't a big deal anyways for the whole Destiny 2 stuff.
1118287	1119329	Was it Destiny or Destiny 2?
1119349	1125799	It was the original Destiny, and it kind of was a big deal, Loki, because they had to erase it with Destiny 2, so...
1125779	1148479	so like it's yeah I I don't know like stunt casting I know I'm not big on stunt casting but I don't look I'm not big on a lot of decisions made in the gaming industry but I mean depending on who they get it could make me laugh I say go for the memes go for go for something that's going to be funny get Taylor Swift I don't know
1150737	1151398	Yeah.
1152198	1152519	Why not?
1152559	1159205	They got Travis Kelsey's mom to be on the new season of The Traitors, which, by the way, is a show I thoroughly enjoy.
1159786	1162869	And so it's always like freaking stunt casting stuff.
1162889	1164971	So, you know, why not?
1165231	1166412	Why not?
1166433	1168515	Get Dylan Efron to be in Marathon.
1168655	1170016	That'll make people pay attention.
1170036	1170336	Do it.
1170917	1171297	Oh, yeah.
1171357	1174621	Bobby Blackwell says, get a marathon runner, an Olympian.
1175161	1176983	Now you're thinking.
1177003	1177744	Now you're thinking.
1178104	1180086	Get some marathon in my marathon.
1181011	1197973	Stunt Casting Stunt Casting
1197953	1215557	But not the type of stunt you saw at Summer Game Fest where somebody made a very desperate plea to make their game stand out above all the others by sounding like a complete edgelord on stage and wearing a hat that wasn't very funny and, you know, ended up having to apologize for it this week, which we'll talk about later.
1215957	1221885	But the whole thing about that was we were trying to do something to make our game stand out.
1224667	1225489	You're an idiot.
1225650	1237444	And I just get sad when I think about all these people that sat in a boardroom and gassed themselves up to think that that was a good idea on how to do it.
1239230	1261221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1261201	1269777	to what gamers are actually looking for in games will sit around and hype themselves up to what a great idea they have to win gamers over.
1272035	1273117	Anyway.
1273137	1276141	From an idea that's essentially Portal anyways.
1276622	1277543	It's a Portal FPS.
1277763	1278204	Yeah, it is.
1278344	1279286	It's FPS with portals.
1279406	1280427	Exactly.
1280447	1281228	All right.
1281869	1282110	Yeah.
1282250	1282931	Oh, great.
1282951	1285154	I love the way Quest Buster phrased this in chat.
1285174	1289521	People talked about it, but as for anyone playing it, it is another story.
1289541	1293306	Yes, talking and playing, because you still have to click that download button.
1293747	1296591	And those are two very different actions.
1296925	1322342	so anyway yeah and just because like people now recognize what your game is it's like I get it there's that whole saying of like no publicity is bad publicity but I don't think that fits here like honestly like like that would be the equivalent of me like getting up there in the game wards or whatever like that and like announcing hey look at my pixel poops game and then taking a dump on the stage like
1323031	1324524	Would that get attention?
1324544	1325594	Brilliant!
1325755	1326340	You should!
1327289	1327995	No.
1329106	1330347	Should we be doing that?
1330367	1330848	No.
1331509	1332430	Obviously not.
1332450	1335873	It's just a stupid, stupid idea.
1335893	1338676	But make sure you take a dump on another game.
1338696	1342120	Make sure you do it on copies of, I don't know, Mind's Eye or whatever the game is.
1342300	1346064	Make sure you do it on Mind's Eye just to make your point.
1346365	1354733	Because you can't lift, you know, as was shown at the Summer Game Fest, you can't lift your own game up without saying, I'm sick of Call of Duty.
1355194	1356996	Isn't Call of Duty a terrible game?
1357016	1358978	You should just shit on Call of Duty, Loki.
1358958	1367449	It'd have to be Marathon, because obviously they're joggers running across the park, so that fits the best, I think, in alignment with Marathon.
1368290	1370693	As runners, but like, yeah.
1370713	1373917	Oh my god, PodCulture in chat says, Call of Duty.
1374558	1377021	That should be, if you ever do a Pixel Poops 3.
1377041	1378223	There you go.
1378243	1384611	And I'm not saying you need to, but if you ever do a Pixel Poops 3, it's gotta be Call of Duty.
1390210	1401773	Pixel Poops 3D, Call of Duty Pixel Poops 3D, Call of Duty But when it's 3D it's gotta be the red and blue like Rad Racer or it just adds a little depth, that's all
1402698	1408485	Alright, before we get into our gaming weeks, we're going to talk about what's going on this week.
1408525	1417657	But I just got a text message from my sister, actually, who says that my dad is watching right now, apparently, but can't figure out how to use the chat room, which is fine.
1418098	1419880	So a big hello to dad.
1419920	1422443	Hi, and a happy Father's Day to you.
1422543	1429532	A happy Father's Day to all the father's figures and all that out there and to all of the special daddies in my life.
1431841	1445800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1446944	1476073	Palia, my usual stuff I mean I really I've been so busy with last week getting ready for recital and then this week I've had ballet more I'm starting a new class next Friday I was gonna start it this past Friday but I was tired and I was gonna go to the protest so but yeah just really my focus has been ballet and political action and just my usual games all right we'll go over to Loki how was your gaming week
1476593	1480438	It was basically just Minecraft stuff, nothing really super productive.
1480478	1490012	Although I did spend like a couple days coding in a data pack to make... So we have this game that's running on our server right now.
1490272	1491293	I don't remember what it's called.
1491313	1493757	But it's basically where you're not supposed to sleep.
1494558	1498423	And then all the phantoms and stuff spawn above you and try to hunt you down.
1498443	1501768	So I made those really annoying and deadly.
1502509	1503310	And...
1503290	1530546	All right.
1531032	1532516	Let's see my gaming week.
1532536	1534361	I'm still enjoying my new Switch 2.
1534381	1535866	I was playing Mario Kart World.
1535886	1544269	I finally got through all of the 50cc tracks so I could unlock, you know, it's not really a spoiler for me to say Rainbow Road is the last track you're going to get.
1544289	1546054	So it works.
1546034	1571569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1571549	1597219	and like I don't want to get too far into it but I was bit by a dog on Tuesday which if you know me I've always had this like because I was bit by a dog when I was a kid so I've always had this weird aversion to big dogs and so the fact that one like actually bit me and yeah this actually I was going out for a walk um and I just had left my house and was starting to go through the neighborhood and this guy had a big huge dog this dog bit me in the stomach
1597199	1618566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1618546	1643575	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1643555	1659572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1660143	1679940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1679920	1682024	that just came out on PlayStation 5.
1682105	1684690	And it's also on Switch 2, but I've been playing it on PlayStation 5.
1685131	1688718	And I'm just, like, I've gone for... I've unlocked way more stuff.
1689259	1692065	I'm starting to finally get to, like, the next tier of crafting.
1692185	1693528	I unlocked every job.
1693969	1695432	Did at least... Well, no, because...
1695412	1716559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1716539	1741062	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1741042	1746674	They craft their own homes with furniture that you can also build and craft.
1747094	1750742	I'm enjoying fantasy life a lot, so I'm excited to do more.
1751023	1754149	Bobby Blackwell says there's seven chapters in the main quest.
1754249	1756895	I don't remember seeing chapter numbers.
1757175	1758578	I really don't.
1758558	1762903	I probably wasn't paying attention, but I could tell you I think I've unlocked three or four trophies.
1762923	1771132	I'd have to look, because unlike Switch, PlayStation has trophies, and I think you get trophies at the end of every major step in the main story.
1771933	1773855	Oh, in the quest log, you can see them.
1773875	1775897	Oh, I'll have to bring it up and check.
1777779	1781443	For those that play the game, I just went through a forest area
1781423	1796327	and it's having me go unlock farming so actually that's probably the easiest benchmark I give because I can tell this is unlocking farming because you go to a giant farm where all these farmers are and I'm pretty sure that's where the story is headed so
1796982	1797282	All right.
1799184	1803288	Mish in chat says, Oh, Rob, if you like that game, you might like Dinkum.
1803568	1804409	Not too sure, though.
1804729	1811535	You know, I think the chill crafting genre is so big right now.
1811555	1812656	Like, we have so many games.
1812716	1816800	People obviously still play Animal Crossing.
1816820	1818561	I know DarkSakura's down with the Palia.
1818982	1822144	And I get it, because I've played and spent a lot of hours on that game, too.
1822164	1824647	I probably would play more if I just didn't have all these other games I was juggling.
1824667	1825167	There's issues in Palia.
1825147	1827010	Oh no, is there?
1827130	1828211	That sucks.
1828452	1830515	That was a fun vibe.
1831596	1851726	Hopefully they're getting it fixed soon, but right now, if I load into my main property, whatever my first property I load into is fine, but if I switch properties, the furniture inside of buildings is gone, and on one of mine, the lines of books and lamps and things are floating amongst the trees a few meters away.
1852767	1853528	I've got screenshots.
1853548	1853989	It's weird.
1853969	1856191	All right, so that's a bummer, but hopefully they get through that.
1856211	1859815	But Disney Dreamlike Valley is another one I'd throw in that category.
1859855	1863058	Like, you know, the chill crafting genre is having its heyday.
1863118	1873268	And yeah, Fantasy Life is, it's kind of that, but it's a little bit, there's just a little bit of like Zelda Link to the Past style combat in there too.
1873348	1875230	Just a little dash of that thrown in.
1876211	1881496	So it's hard to call it a chill crafting game, but it's a low stakes game.
1882618	1883098	Yeah.
1883078	1888229	QuestBuster in chat says, it's so nice hearing how well Fantasy Life is being received.
1888249	1890554	Definitely a game on my must-play sometime list.
1890594	1892258	Yeah, I recommend it.
1892298	1897609	If you like those types of just like chill, casual games, I think there's a lot here for folks to enjoy.
1897629	1902319	I will say I do regret not waiting to get it on the Switch 2.
1902299	1926602	I think the only reason to get it on the PlayStation 5 would be trophies like if you're that big of a trophy whore but I think that's a very very very small percent of the population and there is cross save I did notice that when you save you can cross save I think it is available on PC as well because it talked about needing an Epic Games account to do cross save but I would have got it on Switch too if I knew then what I knew now so but it is what it is
1927308	1929731	Oh yeah, Stardew Valley, Questmaster brings up as well.
1929971	1931773	That game's never gone away.
1932153	1933555	That's always been there.
1933915	1936078	And Minecraft!
1936098	1939462	Yeah, we love a crafting game.
1939482	1943026	Alright, we're going to get into some more gaming news.
1943046	1944467	Just a quick programming note.
1944527	1949092	I've been mentioning this for a couple weeks, but just to make sure you all know, we will not be here next week.
1949573	1951795	I will be in Atlanta, Georgia.
1951876	1954058	I will be from Atlanta, Georgia next week.
1954038	1967383	Just like Nicole Page Brooks, I will be at Southern Fried Gaming Expo over the weekend.
1967403	1968585	I'm really looking forward to it.
1968645	1969948	It is a very fun convention.
1970368	1973454	Smaller than DragonCon, but that's not a bad thing.
1973474	1976620	I love being able to just pull up a chair and play some board games.
1976600	1982986	Play some game room type games, whether it's pinball or arcade games.
1983006	1991594	And Bobby Blackwolf and I will have a panel on Friday night about veteran podcasters talk about classic video games.
1991694	1997739	And we're going to be talking about classic video games that we think have been missed by most people.
1998440	2003384	Because, sure, you could say Zelda or Katamari Damacy was brought up earlier.
2003604	2005786	Katamari Damacy is a classic game you should play.
2005806	2006387	Yeah, it's not.
2006367	2007389	Yeah, obscure.
2007489	2009291	Exactly, exactly, exactly.
2009311	2012977	Yes, it is a classic game, but I don't know if that's necessarily obscure enough.
2012997	2017764	Maybe the bro camp thinks it's obscure, but you know, not everyone's into Madden.
2018084	2025035	So Bobby has also called this panel Rob's excuse to get up on stage and talk about the Guardian legend for an hour.
2025616	2027559	And to be honest, he's not wrong.
2028320	2029902	Like, drag me.
2029962	2031284	Like, you got me.
2031785	2031885	Yeah.
2031865	2034168	So, yes.
2034188	2034588	Accurate.
2034969	2035449	Accurate.
2037491	2039374	Don't attack me this hard during Pride Month.
2039694	2041836	But no, it is, yeah, absolutely.
2042097	2044520	I will be talking about the Guardian Legend as one of the games.
2044600	2045340	You've been calm for, okay?
2045360	2046502	You've been calm for.
2049145	2051988	He went in your dressing room and cut up all your wigs.
2052008	2052549	What wig?
2052709	2053189	What wig?
2053229	2057494	The bitch is already bald, y'all.
2057514	2058936	That's why I said wigs.
2060097	2061179	All right.
2061199	2065585	Anyway, but that'll be Friday night at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.
2065705	2067568	And I'll be, you know, I'll be around all weekend.
2068349	2071553	I'm leaving Sunday, but I have enough time Sunday to enjoy most of the show.
2071613	2073556	So, yeah, it'll be good.
2073576	2074518	So excited.
2075219	2082549	Bobby Blackwolf will also not be here next weekend as something about sports ball right after Southern Fried.
2082589	2086054	He has to go to Southern Fried Sports Ball, but that'll be fun, too, I'm sure.
2086034	2093942	I will be back in Atlanta in like seven or eight weeks after this weekend to go to DragonCon.
2093962	2095604	It's coming up real quick.
2095804	2098467	Really excited for this year's DragonCon.
2098988	2106276	I can say I won't know what panels I'm doing until probably two weeks before, and even then they can probably change, so stay tuned to socials.
2106456	2115045	But I will say the one panel we know that – well, it's not really a panel, but the one event Bobby and I know that we will be doing at DragonCon, so you can put it on your calendars now –
2115025	2137928	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2137908	2144277	I've been podcasting for a little bit now and doing Twitch streaming, so maybe I have some insights somebody else might appreciate.
2144497	2149083	That'll be Thursday night at DragonCon, which is Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.
2149263	2151326	Really excited about all of that.
2151787	2153509	Not here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.
2154891	2159477	With that, let's go over to Loki and start off our news of the week.
2160368	2163335	Yeah, let's talk about the game that's behind me, Mind's Eye.
2163355	2170290	Like I said, came out, AAA game, no complaints whatsoever, except, yeah, it sucked.
2170491	2177787	So it's been buggy as, it's basically cyberpunk all over again almost, except, you know,
2177767	2205748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2205728	2221948	There's been clips circulating around of cars clipping into each other and then of course as you touch the car they just explode in physics and there was another sponsored segment where we had some streamers basically having trouble
2222215	2239937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2239917	2259445	and if you want to pick up Mind's Eye it's available now on PC and all this stuff and he's like trying not to bust up laughing like he's got a face like and sorry I have to describe it for the podcasters but it's that like I'm trying not to bust up laughing but it's like just that whole irony of like what has my life become I'm sitting here recommending broken shit to people
2259425	2261769	There was another one I saw as well.
2262450	2282119	So a Twitch streamer by the name of ConeCarnage was about to start a playthrough when he got an urgent email from the actual game developer saying that they're canceling the sponsored playthrough because it's been so poorly received.
2282600	2284563	He's like, I've never had that happen.
2285244	2286546	That is interesting.
2286526	2288428	But yeah, it's been lots of pushback.
2289069	2298340	Sony has even removed it from the PlayStation Store and has been issuing refunds for the PlayStation 5 version because it's been also crashing.
2299381	2303746	And yeah, so it's not in good shape right now.
2304607	2313377	And of course, like I said, you know, lots of poor reviews and just it's being dragged all throughout the Internet right now.
2314876	2316118	I might have missed it.
2316538	2318320	One of the worst rated games this year, I think.
2318340	2321384	I might have missed it, Loki, but Bobby in chat asked a very good question.
2321485	2322446	Is this an $80 game?
2324448	2326010	It's not an $80 game.
2326311	2329735	It is at least a $60 game.
2329755	2334882	I think I have it on my wish list right now.
2335483	2339087	Just because I didn't know it was going to be a piece of trash when it came out.
2339468	2340229	This is important.
2340769	2342652	Loki likes broken games.
2342732	2343533	I'm like...
2343513	2346778	That could be fun, just like kind of sandboxing.
2347138	2354789	I like a good sandbox game that's got glitchy traffic in ped physics or weapons or whatever the case may be.
2354809	2358094	I just hear it's like a real slog to get through the whole thing.
2359256	2360998	But yeah, so Mind's Eye...
2360978	2376068	It is the $60 game.
2376048	2399845	and Loki is the only person I know that would sit there and actually play Driver 3 for a significant amount of time not like the five minutes to do one thing and go lol this game sucks and go on to the next game actually sit there and go I can break it like this and I can break it like this and when I do it it's stupid I love it like Loki like loves broken games
2400382	2421715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2421695	2430385	Close proximity of them that was kind of like stupid and dumb and had them running around in their game because they thought they were so edgy and like, look at us.
2430706	2433128	Our game is a Grand Theft Auto killer.
2433309	2435431	And it's like, no, it's not.
2435691	2436693	It's not at all.
2437253	2439776	That's the old shenanigans.
2439836	2442960	That's the type of shenanigans that like, you know, this...
2442940	2458941	Blitgate or whatever should be doing not wearing stupid hats making stupid bold assertions in your game you know you should have had Master Chief just getting destroyed super easy or something like that you know because your game is so good like that that's how you do it it's still bad but yeah
2459073	2460114	I don't know.
2460275	2469987	QuestBusterChat says, from what I understand, the game was supposed to leverage another project called Everywhere that was supposed to be like Roblox but with more realistic graphics like those in Mind's Eye.
2470328	2476616	It's a linear experience set in a world designed for an open world experience but is treated like a very pretty obstacle course instead.
2476636	2479039	Weren't you talking a little bit about this last week?
2479019	2480842	Wasn't this the same game?
2481002	2483327	I think someone brought up something like that.
2483347	2486292	But yeah, I know that they had that platform.
2486672	2492943	Once again, a bold assertion that anyone's going to want to do things on your platform.
2492983	2504183	I mean, I want to say that Fortnite tried doing... Or Epic had done something similar with that, where they had a platform that was essentially Unreal Engine, but it had...
2504163	2507370	Fortnite stuff in it, but not actually Fortnite.
2507530	2510255	It was supposed to be a game platform that they could make games on and stuff.
2510556	2514885	But I think they ended up pivoting that into Fortnite to actually create games within that.
2516488	2521959	Yeah, it's been done to death like several times where they're going to create these giant platforms because they want that Roblox money.
2522380	2525867	I mean, my kids were telling me, was it that...
2526134	2530680	Grow a Garden keeps gaining 2 million players every day.
2532983	2535987	It's the largest video game out there now.
2536007	2541254	This no-name game made by some dude in their... probably some kid in their garage.
2541895	2546361	It's just... I'm talking about taking it back, but not in a good way, though.
2546942	2548384	These are bad games.
2548404	2550787	They're not good games at all.
2550807	2553611	It's just people are playing them for some reason.
2553932	2554572	Yeah.
2554592	2554993	Wow.
2556273	2565675	but they have a deluxe edition for Mind's Eye for $80 so you can get that it has some skins in it for an extra you know more expense
2566111	2569655	Loki, I feel like you know more about this game certainly than I do.
2570596	2574560	I don't know if you have an answer to this, but I look at a game like Cyberpunk 2077.
2575441	2579305	Also had a pretty botched launch, ended up with refunds and all that stuff.
2579726	2584271	But most people that played the game at this point would tell you they've turned that game around a lot.
2584291	2587714	If you haven't played Cyberpunk 2077, it's a good game and it's worth your time.
2588455	2591038	By the time I was playing it on Stadia, it was a lot better.
2591018	2602020	Yeah, like, well, wasn't Stadia, like, I remember a whole, like, thing where it was like, actually, it was best on Stadia because Stadia had the power to run it because it was a cloud thing.
2602061	2605167	Like, I remember that being a whole thing when that game came out.
2605187	2606209	But anyway, I digress.
2606189	2612043	It wasn't just that, too, is that you also didn't have to sit through a bunch of patching and everything, but you're right, it was an optimized system.
2612244	2613066	Yeah.
2613086	2615592	And then, of course, Ranmari brings up Diablo 3.
2615752	2616775	Yes, pod culture.
2616815	2619522	I mean, I don't think Diablo 3 had like a bunch... Well, no, it did.
2619943	2621346	Actually, I mean, it was...
2621326	2627876	What I mean, like, I don't remember it being, like, buggy broken, but now I remember everybody got a login error that first day, so it was pretty screwed up.
2628096	2630059	But, of course, the Auction House was a problem, yes.
2630099	2632002	Like, I'm not saying Diablo III didn't have its issues.
2632042	2633144	There's just different type of issues.
2633765	2638252	And then PodCulture mentions No Man's Sky, which, again, I think different set of issues.
2638352	2640435	The game wasn't, like, broken.
2640535	2642699	It just wasn't what people expected.
2643119	2645403	I think Cyberpunk's a closer sort of thing.
2645864	2648127	But, anyway, my point is...
2648107	2654513	they turned all these games around and made them salvageable will this game be salvageable or are they fucked?
2656114	2676612	I think that making them salvageable is kind of the exception to the rule because there's been a lot of games that have launched that they didn't really do that or didn't accomplish that completely so I don't know I don't know much about this development team so I can't really say that they would do that I would hope that you know
2677283	2683577	Leslie Benzie or whatever of Grand Theft Auto has made, you know, produced a lot of great games, is able to put out a good game.
2683597	2693419	But then again, I mean, hey, we thought that the Mega Man creator could put out a good Mega Man game and... On a same...
2694108	2704447	Honestly, the guy here with Mind's Eye should pick up the phone and call Sean Murray over at Hello Games, No Man's Sky, and just have a venting conversation, have a therapy discussion.
2704467	2706411	Yeah, I mean, I never want to see a game fail.
2706431	2710979	I would love to play, like, another Grand Theft Auto-looking game, you know, especially, like, a sci-fi one.
2710999	2712522	That looks awesome, but...
2713177	2714419	I hear this is dumb.
2714499	2720787	Like, already, like, speaking of, like, bad AI and the cops and stuff like that, like, I remember that was a thing with Cyberpunk.
2720807	2723891	A little bit on the opposite side, whereas they were too deadly.
2724272	2731041	In this game, you could murder somebody right in front of the police robot and it just, like, keeps walking by.
2731061	2732122	Just, whatever.
2732924	2734486	I don't care what you're doing.
2736008	2737750	It's pretty buggy and broken.
2737730	2743125	Jay Helinski in chat says, that seems to be the world in which we live these days, though.
2743445	2745832	Push out a turd and fix it in post.
2745852	2749542	And this is why everybody's pissed about $80 video games.
2750204	2753713	Now, Nintendo rarely pushes out
2753913	2778081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2778061	2781326	When I don't know the team making it, I don't know.
2781406	2785211	It's claiming to be a such and such killer without the evidence to back it up.
2785652	2797629	You know, I think gamers are getting a lot more savvy to that type of stuff than when we lived in the era of getting all of our information from magazines where we can see it a lot more directly in real time.
2797649	2806361	Pre-ordering a game previously was because you wanted to make sure that whatever game store you're purchasing at has a copy for you.
2806441	2807022	Yeah.
2807727	2832283	Day One Skin
2832263	2835528	Why would I buy a collector's edition for this game?
2835849	2836530	I don't know.
2836931	2838674	This game is a brand new IP.
2839054	2840457	I don't know if this is going to be successful.
2840477	2843882	Why would I want some like tchotchke and collectible thing to put on my shelf?
2843902	2848390	It's not like Grand Theft Auto where they've had several successful releases or something like that.
2848410	2849051	One after another.
2849071	2855622	It's like, why would I purchase a collector's edition for this thing that's brand new that...
2856479	2859875	Probably, there's a good chance it might suck.
2859895	2860236	I don't know.
2860317	2865159	That's a bold assertion for a first in a franchise game.
2865220	2865983	I don't know.
2867026	2889068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2889048	2916861	and it was confirmed during this Konami series of announcements that the original Silent Hill Silent Hill 1 will get a remake from Bloober Team the same group that recently did Silent Hill 2 and the way Jamie reacted is the way most of the internet is reacting is that yes which is funny though because like what we saw initially when Silent Hill 2 was like oh no like everyone's like it's got that Konami stank on it and now it's like oh well Bloober Team's good
2916841	2917963	But you know what?
2919306	2921430	And this is my plea.
2922371	2932470	As your podcast elder in video game culture, this is my plea to all of you out there making your own podcasts and your YouTubes and your Twitch channels and all this stuff.
2932450	2938055	If you're going to highlight the bad shit, like we just did in that last story, you should highlight the good shit too.
2938536	2940658	So we should take a minute and acknowledge, you know what?
2940898	2950207	Bloober deserved this because they did, despite the expectations that people had, they did a great job with the Silent Hill 2 remake, and now they're being rewarded with this.
2950227	2952570	And we are being rewarded because we will get to play it.
2953190	2956934	Is the Silent Hill 1 remake something I'm likely to pre-order?
2957334	2957554	Yeah.
2958155	2958255	Yeah.
2958235	2978185	because now you've got the tracker now if it's $80 I don't know about that I don't know about that because the original is still around but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it um the Silent Hill remake is something I'm absolutely you know excited for uh and it's yeah it's well done by Bloober so congrats
2979312	2996680	of course we didn't see hardly anything don't don't expect that we have footage it's just it's just they're gonna do it yay it'll probably take them two or three years at least to do it so I would almost like rather than make a new Silent Hill game instead of just remaking one like why why remake one at this point it's kind of
2996660	2998503	Yes and no.
2998784	3002470	I understand the charm behind the remakes and so forth.
3002911	3006938	I'm not going to say don't do it, but I don't disagree with you, Loki.
3006958	3009943	I feel like, ooh, they've done such a good job with this.
3009963	3011626	Why not see what they can do?
3012668	3018077	Maybe it's because some of their own original horror IPs have been a little bit more mixed on the
3018057	3047575	and you know they don't want anything to conflict there's nothing to say Blooper's not working on something like that too but Konami doesn't want to talk about it until Silent Hill F is out the door and has had a little space to breathe so you know they wouldn't want to announce this competing Silent Hill original game now with Silent Hill F around the corner but it's very likely that they're going to wait and see how Silent Hill F lands to decide what direction they're going to go to for future updates in the game but yeah I'm
3047555	3061869	In general, you know, since we're talking about the Konami did their own series, they mentioned that that Suikoden game that's supposed to be for mobile phones will also be hitting Steam, which is a huge relief for folks that, you know, would prefer to play keyboard, mouse, and that whole thing.
3062329	3067835	You know, Konami's been on a bit of a win streak lately.
3067855	3071018	Like, again, we need to give credit where credit is due.
3071038	3075402	And for all the fuck Konami era, which was justified...
3075382	3083383	It's almost as if somebody out there, hold on to your hats, it's almost as if somebody out there listened.
3084629	3086412	It's almost as if somebody listened.
3086432	3086833	Gasp!
3087714	3090379	And started making pivots and said, you know what?
3091100	3096109	Yes, Rinmari in chat says, I feel like Konami are healing.
3096129	3098072	Yes, it definitely does feel like that.
3098854	3102821	And Rinmari also says they separated their arcade game division from their gambling division recently.
3102841	3104143	Yes, we had that.
3104183	3108170	Rinmari's a big fan of Gradius, talking about the first serious Gradius project in 15 years.
3108190	3108831	Yes.
3108811	3115598	Konami has done a great job giving their strong intellectual properties to other developers who can nurture it correctly.
3115618	3116940	And that's not a bad thing.
3117600	3119583	It's great.
3119603	3122966	Speaking of Gradius, I think that's a good segue to our next story, DarkSakura.
3124828	3126610	Oh, yeah, but I don't know.
3126630	3128873	I mean, it's not unexpected, but a little sad.
3129834	3133878	Gradius V is being delisted from PS3.
3134619	3138463	And I mean, PS3 is an old machine.
3138781	3139743	It's an older game.
3140504	3144051	I don't know why, but it's happening.
3144191	3161363	But it was because of a license for the software that's being used in Gradius V. There was a re-release in 2015, and then there's the delisting happening this, so it's likely a 10-year license.
3162963	3169231	But, I mean, we've got Gradius Origins, so they'll have the compilation.
3169611	3174537	But it doesn't look like it's going to include Gradius V. That's a bummer.
3175078	3176860	I mean, the Gradius Collection will be tight.
3176980	3178302	I actually would love to pick that up.
3178322	3179523	I love the one on the PSP.
3180204	3182727	They had a Gradius Collection on PSP that was fucking fire.
3182747	3184610	So I'm glad it's kind of coming around again.
3185571	3188194	But yeah, it's a bummer about Gradius V, but...
3189507	3191171	It sucks for game preservation.
3191512	3197589	I mean, I understand contract agreements, you only get so many years, blah, blah, blah, but it still sucks.
3198651	3201980	It wasn't... I think there's a physical copy.
3202020	3202622	I think I...
3203750	3229420	I still think Gradius 2 is better I love Gradius 2 as well
3230294	3237322	Um, okay, before we get to our next story, Loki, I have to ask because I've been watching the Minds Eye footage behind you.
3237342	3241547	Was that a CPR minigame that was happening in there?
3241567	3252580	Because I swear you were having to tap to the beat and I'm going, they're actually teaching you the right because I while I was watching the pattern, I was going, staying alive, staying alive.
3253421	3254682	Because you know, that's the beat.
3254662	3283268	that you're supposed to do CPR to and there's a bunch of other songs that people use too but Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees is the one I always remember and I was like, they're actually teaching you the rhythm for CPR that's actually kind of neat in a way they have to patch the game because it's too hard or too like I think you have to be right on the money for that stuff in order for it to work and as
3284227	3287093	Questmaster is saying that the games go on too long.
3287775	3288937	So, yeah.
3290180	3292826	Yeah, that is the thing, though, they have in this game.
3292846	3293067	Okay.
3293387	3297757	Sorry, I had to ask because that caught my eye and I was like, is that like a legit CPR minigame?
3297777	3299220	That's so wild.
3299240	3299441	All right.
3299461	3300463	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
3301591	3306177	Alright, let's talk about another console selling like hotcakes.
3306537	3307659	That would be the Switch 2.
3307819	3316009	Yes, what have we really shown Nintendo that will buy the Switch 2 or anything they sell for any price that they put it out for?
3316029	3317611	We are all consumer whores!
3317731	3319213	Yay!
3319313	3320434	And hell!
3320775	3324259	It's sold 3.5 million units in four days.
3324499	3327463	It's the biggest console launch of all time.
3328658	3330883	Good job on us.
3330963	3332447	We are part of the problem.
3333269	3333830	You know what, though?
3333910	3336837	There's a few other factors that go into this that I think are important.
3337318	3341247	Number one, Nintendo actually had the supply to meet demand.
3341267	3345958	And to their credit, that's probably why this console got delayed several times.
3345938	3352347	I truly believe this console, I think this console, a form of it was probably going to be out years ago when the OLED came out.
3352367	3359818	But I think Nintendo may have been ready to launch this thing last holiday, but just didn't have enough of them ready to go.
3359838	3363964	And so they waited and they had plenty to go around.
3363944	3384484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3384464	3404785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3405760	3418542	And I think another important factor outside of the price that is important is that the age of people that have grown up with video games all of their life have gotten older.
3420065	3429642	So like you have just as many people in their 30s and 40s that are excited for Pokemon as there are teenagers, right?
3430145	3448137	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3448117	3463000	and even if we're talking since 2017, even eight years is a long time for people to have gotten older and the buying power to be with more generations that have grown up with video games in their lives.
3463020	3468468	So I think a lot of that plays into why the Switch 2 is doing well as well.
3468488	3475879	I think, yes, I'm not trying to poo-poo on their accomplishments because, sure, Nintendo has strong IPs, Mario Kart
3475859	3478543	sells bananas copies for reasons.
3479003	3480005	It's always strong.
3480045	3481487	They always do well.
3481507	3486714	We always knew Switch 2, there was going to be a demand for it, that there's going to be enough Nintendo fans to substantiate it.
3487115	3494205	But I think it's also important to recognize that, you know what, just in general, there's more people willing to drop the money on game consoles.
3496008	3504203	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, I met someone in the line for the Switch 2 when I said that I was at the same place for the 360 launch.
3504223	3512718	He said that the 360 was his first ever midnight console launch, and that night was his kids' first midnight console launch.
3513199	3517206	I think that's a great... Yeah, and I think that story...
3517372	3520577	Exactly encapsulates what I'm talking about.
3520597	3525344	There's more gaming built into the family entertainment system, really.
3526205	3527627	And then let's see.
3528008	3536139	Rinmari says, I remember when Pokemon was seen as an uncool for kids only thing and pod culture said those kids are now adults.
3536159	3536360	100%.
3537762	3541006	I remember when we were collecting the Burger King toys.
3541027	3542228	No kings, but Burger King.
3543170	3546855	I remember when we were-
3547088	3558264	I remember trying to get those Pokemon toys and the workers thought we were ridiculous because we were college age adults in line for Pokemon toys, really excited about it.
3558765	3560127	And they're like, you're not kidding.
3560147	3562330	You know, they didn't say that to us, but you can feel the judgment.
3562350	3563432	Like these toys are for kids.
3563712	3565435	These are the kids meals toys.
3566275	3567396	What are you doing?
3567416	3568617	And it's like, guess what?
3569398	3571420	We're all adults now.
3571440	3573943	So anyway, are you kidding?
3574003	3577626	Jay Helinski in chat says, OMFG, the BK toys.
3577646	3579808	We won that sweepstakes as kids.
3579969	3581810	Are you kidding?
3581830	3582531	What did you win?
3582571	3586055	Was that the one that like Mew was super rare or something?
3586075	3587696	Mew or one of them was really rare.
3588137	3591400	And if you got it, you won some type of Uber prize.
3592661	3593602	What a small world.
3593662	3594443	I love that.
3595672	3598419	All right, I want to come back to that chat comment when I have more.
3598439	3604796	In the meantime, let's talk about some other things going on in Nintendo's world, which includes what's next for Splatoon?
3605116	3609287	Because we, you know, Splatoon was a pretty big part of the original Switch lineup.
3609307	3611132	So what's coming next for Splatoon?
3611112	3624424	Well, Splatoon was not a part of the Switch 2 launch, of course, but the upgrade for Splatoon 3, where it will run a little bit better on the Switch 2, as a lot of the other games have, that did hit this last week.
3624444	3625705	I believe that was on the 12th.
3626126	3641119	So it was announced in a little, I don't want to call it a direct, it was more of a Squid Research Lab update that occurred from Nintendo, where they talked about the upgrades for Splatoon 3, but there is also going to be a brand new spin-off game,
3641099	3670093	Splatoon Raiders
3670225	3671766	What was that called with all the posts?
3671786	3673628	Remember how the posts would feed into Splatoon?
3674409	3676471	And that is still a thing.
3676611	3685319	Like, Miiverse is gone, but they built a similar version of that mechanic in Splatoon, and so there's all these messages in Splatoon.
3685339	3695368	And somebody had posted on Blue Sky this week, and I saw it, that if you go into Splatoon 3 right now, there's all these happy pride messages, very heartwarming types of things.
3695968	3699411	Squid rights and trans rights types of things that were in the game.
3699732	3700232	And it's like,
3700212	3703302	You don't see gamers being wholesome very often.
3703362	3704746	Good job, Splatoon community.
3705268	3706713	You did the thing.
3707154	3708057	That's cute.
3708378	3708739	For sure.
3708980	3710184	I loved seeing that.
3710645	3714036	It actually made me want to visit Splatoon 3 again, to be honest.
3714438	3715139	Yeah, pretty cool.
3715720	3719285	So more stuff coming in the Splatoon world very soon.
3719305	3719585	All right.
3719685	3723911	By the way, a follow-up to the earlier comment about winning the sweepstakes by Jay Helinski.
3724612	3729438	The gold plaques, the balls, and a bunch of cards and other merch.
3730119	3731041	That's wild.
3731641	3733464	Congratulations.
3733484	3734786	I never won anything as a kid.
3735166	3735967	Actually, it's not true.
3736288	3743097	I won a contest at Dimple Records, a local chain which no longer exists anymore.
3743838	3743938	Yeah.
3744053	3760062	and they once had a wheelbarrow full of smashed vinyl records and the contest was guess how many records are in the wheelbarrow and to this day I remember my answer.
3760082	3761725	It was 79.
3762245	3783527	and I was right myself and one other person split the prize which was like a hundred dollar gift card or something like that and I remember as a kid I won this when I was like 13 as a kid I remember my logic was it looks like it's about 80 but it's not gonna be a round number so I put 79 and I was right
3783507	3809717	I outsmarted them so um but I won a gift card and that was how I bought Castlevania 3 Simon's Quest because they sold they used to sell video games I I'm sure you recall a day when they sold NES games at Dimple Record they're no longer with us sadly but um they sold uh Nintendo games and I bought Castlevania 3 with the money from the sweepstakes and then six months later my copy of the game was stolen out of my backpack at school
3809697	3824584	DarkSakura
3825391	3827214	How about some SEGA stuff?
3827234	3827335	Yeah.
3827355	3838054	So they actually said that the Initial D racing team influenced how they wanted Sonic Racing Crossworlds to feel.
3840058	3843484	The producer Taki Ryuichi said
3843464	3862435	and Kobayakawa Masaru, their creative director, spoke about the work they had going into this and said how they were totally into Initial D and that the team behind that was really crucial to helping the game find its feel.
3862415	3873174	They were saying that they wanted part to be like OutRun and this part to be like Sega Rally and going through those various games to incorporate what they wanted most in there.
3873194	3884153	But they said the biggest influence was Initial D and Kobayakawa, the quote is, I've been working on the Initial D series for almost 20 years in the past.
3884133	3892270	The gameplay of driving through winding mountain passes was very difficult, but the latest work, Initial D the Arcade, is surprisingly easy to operate.
3892831	3900267	I think the reason we were able to introduce the feeling we've built up over the years into this work is because the development was centered around the Initial D development team.
3900588	3901770	So there you go.
3903083	3931048	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3932227	3936111	DJ Ranma S says there's a new initial D anime out.
3936817	3937498	Yeah.
3937758	3942023	There's still people that play Power, Power, Paradise.
3942043	3952014	And one of my friends had the version for PlayStation 2 recently, like within the last two months, had the PlayStation 2 version with the pink biscuits and had some friends over.
3952534	3959962	And one of the other guys there was somebody that goes to Fanime regularly and all that stuff and knew all the dances still to this day.
3959982	3961925	And when I got out there, I'm like, I know one.
3961945	3962886	I know Boom, Boom, Fire.
3963066	3963707	Boom, Boom, Fire.
3963767	3964928	Boom, Boom, Fire.
3964948	3965068	Like,
3965048	3965909	I remember that one.
3966150	3967271	It's just muscle memory at that point.
3967371	3968213	But I don't know them all.
3968553	3970055	But this guy actually knew a bunch.
3970095	3972779	And I'm always like, Eurobeat lives on in our heart.
3972999	3973440	I love it.
3974682	3977926	Last year at TwitchCon, they had Parapara.
3978087	3979188	That's right.
3980230	3984356	And I think I did the same three songs over and over, but they were always my favorite.
3984516	3984796	Right.
3986178	3988221	Of course, one of them was Deluxe.
3988471	3992738	Oh yeah, the ass-shaking one Wasn't the Mickey Mouse March one of the ones you did too?
3992958	3994280	I don't remember No?
3994520	4015052	Oh, I thought it was No, my big ones were Night of Fire, Eurobeat Night of Fire I used to know Ice Dime Us, but I don't remember that one very well Anyway And I knew a few others, but those were my big three
4015100	4035842	Ranmari in chat says the old Eurobeat producers and labels have band camps now remember Eurobeat musicians aren't mainstream big name actual acts you don't say they're closer to AA musicians yeah I get it I think they've always kind of lived in that realm but it's cute so alright anyway let's move on to some shitty news Loki
4036058	4044787	Yeah, so we have word that Bend Studios has basically laid off at least 40 of their developers.
4044847	4051194	This is because, according to them, earlier this year, of course, they wrapped development on a live service concept.
4051634	4055178	And at their careful consideration, they chose not to move forward with it.
4055718	4064007	And as they're shifting towards their next project, they've made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success.
4064138	4083514	DarkSakura,
4083713	4084635	Live Service Game.
4085737	4091950	This is weird because Sony is all about the live service stuff and yet they're turning all the stuff down.
4092111	4093734	They're going all in on one or two.
4093754	4095217	Maybe don't put all those things in that basket.
4095418	4096280	Yeah.
4097743	4099326	It's wild.
4099306	4111931	So, do you think... I mean, you were mentioning earlier in the show that, like, this is wild that these layoffs are happening while, meanwhile, they're shattering records over here.
4112051	4114637	Like, why can't they move them to another project or something?
4114657	4116200	It's just... It's silly.
4116220	4116681	Exactly.
4117021	4118344	It's just... It's...
4118881	4120844	I mean, it's fine.
4120944	4122806	It's what they're going to keep doing.
4123046	4131678	They have to show more profit, but then now that this is the most profitable generation, your shareholders are going to want more for next generation.
4131898	4133320	It's got to be infinite growth.
4133340	4134942	$90 games, Loki.
4134962	4136264	$90 games.
4136324	4136784	Can't stop.
4136805	4137265	Won't stop.
4138146	4146357	I mean, I guess it's a good thing that Minds Eye wasn't a $90 game, but the fact that there was a version that was even still...
4147332	4167484	you know $80 that is ridiculous like honestly like stop stop putting out these incomplete games I don't care if you're AAA studio or if you're just a small studio put out a game that is in a playable state you know and if it needs to be held back it needs to be held back yeah
4169084	4184106	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
4184086	4185508	We played other Bomani games, too.
4185548	4187671	We loved music-infused games.
4187691	4188192	There still do.
4188252	4189233	I shouldn't say the past.
4189253	4195482	It's just we don't go to the arcades anymore to play these games because they're not often... Well, a lot of the landscapes change.
4195763	4205637	They're not often there, but now with the return of Round 1 and sort of this... Sorry, the arrival of Round 1 and sort of this resurgence of Konami's arcade products.
4205657	4210143	But I think you all know there were many years where there weren't just a lot of DDR machines to be found.
4210183	4211545	It was extremely niche and...
4211525	4218334	Let's be real, we all got older and have asthma and can't do the very hard songs that we used to be able to do.
4219074	4223961	But also the landscape of what many arcades look like has really changed.
4224121	4234013	And now, you know, you see, like the last time I was at Roseville Golf Land, where this is the place where Loki, myself, DarkSakura would meet every single week to play DDR.
4234033	4236416	And they had, what, like three DDR machines at one point?
4236436	4237257	A bunch of other stuff too?
4237658	4239540	It was really, you know...
4239520	4262254	Ticket Redemption Hubs
4262234	4272160	And so it's actually not surprising to see that Konami is location testing this week a version of Dance Dance Revolution that spits out tickets.
4272308	4295312	Dance Dance Revolution Stomp Arrows
4295562	4311563	Spider Stomp
4311543	4331931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4332991	4357294	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4357274	4358055	It just plays.
4358235	4364781	And there's, you know, from the location test, we know that Party Rock Anthem is one of the songs.
4364922	4367304	LMFAO is one of the songs that can come up in this game.
4367784	4371929	There is a version of the William Tell Overture that's in this game as well.
4371949	4375032	And I'm sure there's going to be other Konami covers and things like that as well.
4375072	4376273	Maybe a few licenses.
4376633	4379776	But no, apparently you do not even get to pick.
4379796	4380457	It's Max 300.
4380477	4380697	Why?
4381678	4384581	That's funny.
4385253	4387797	You get a randomized song.
4387817	4389719	You get one song per credit.
4390200	4392023	And I guess you can do three credits at a time.
4393184	4396809	The step zone is circle around edges of the screen.
4396829	4398352	So I'm not actually even sure.
4398712	4400555	It looks like it might be like a diamond type.
4400615	4402137	It's not arrows floating at the top.
4402397	4403158	It's like a diamond.
4403178	4405181	It comes into the center.
4405221	4408025	So imagine if you will, like Tempest or something like that.
4408105	4408886	Guitaroman?
4408987	4409748	Is it Guitaroman?
4409928	4410028	Yeah.
4410008	4416785	I don't know, but I was just thinking, like, what in the groove arrow modifiers are we looking at here?
4416866	4426009	Because it feels like something straight out of Stepmania, where it's, like, kind of coming towards the screen from, like, I don't know.
4426867	4427409	Somewhere in Game.
4427429	4432463	But yeah, it's weird to have like a big vertical screen like that and then have the arrows come out of the center of the screen.
4432503	4435010	It's like, shouldn't it be vertical because the screen is vertical?
4435492	4437718	This is literally the perfect format for that.
4437758	4440927	But no, do something else, I guess.
4441042	4442744	I don't know.
4442884	4445626	There is no e-amusement support, which isn't that surprising.
4446087	4451572	And what happens is that after you clear a stage, a super bonus challenge will come up.
4451592	4456817	You step on the up arrow and it does a roulette and you get a random number of tickets.
4456937	4461602	The payout will increase per stage a possible jackpot of 1,000 tickets.
4461962	4462483	So I'm not here.
4462603	4466126	Does your skill affect the amount of tickets you get at all?
4466146	4469209	Or is it just play DDR and gamble?
4470235	4476482	I think it does, but then you also get a bonus amount at the end or something like that.
4476882	4486533	We started this show 23 years ago about a video game that has now literally become Gamble, Gamble, Gamble, Gamble, Die.
4487334	4491419	That said... That's a Wonder Shows reference, people.
4491439	4495163	If we had this back when we were playing DDR...
4495970	4497834	That would have solved a lot of problems.
4498135	4503586	One, it would have given something for the babies to go stomp on instead of our... Yes, that's true.
4503606	4506633	And two, a game that we could get a lot of tickets from.
4506934	4507415	That's right.
4507555	4508276	That's a win-win.
4508337	4511363	We would have all bought our Nintendo GameCubes with tickets.
4515460	4517203	Anyway, there it is.
4517223	4518706	Some things have come full circle.
4518726	4520869	And if you want to check that out, it is location testing.
4520909	4525056	I don't know how long, but it's at round one in Puente Hills Mall.
4525076	4526859	So that's where it's location testing.
4526879	4530145	But I imagine within a couple months, it'll be everywhere.
4530833	4532895	Coming to your round one near you.
4532955	4533595	That's right.
4533656	4534536	Probably, probably.
4534576	4537879	But hey, the round ones, I wish they... I'm getting so lazy.
4537919	4540782	I'm always like, I wish they'd build a round one in Sacramento.
4540802	4542083	I wish they'd build a round one in Sacramento.
4542363	4543304	Finally, they do.
4543404	4545867	And I'm like, but it's in Roseville.
4545907	4547068	It's so far.
4547268	4549750	Why can't they build one on the other side of town?
4550170	4553253	Put one downtown or in Natomas.
4553273	4553734	Come on.
4553774	4558398	There's a big old Macy's right by the arena that is no longer there.
4558478	4560059	It's a perfect spot for a round one.
4560239	4560840	Come on.
4560820	4584702	but no they won't do it because there's a punch bowl social already there which is a very very very similar thing but just with less games all right yeah yeah i know i know but to be fair a better brunch menu to be fair that's true they had really good brunch and and the alcohol comes in a punch bowl hence the name so there are there are pros and cons to be fair okay let's go
4586082	4587944	Rob said brunch and I was like, let's go.
4589405	4594570	Let's go to our next segment, which is DarkSakura's walk down memory lane.
4603458	4612947	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4612967	4615650	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4616153	4617986	This is a great pick, DarkSakura.
4618006	4619920	What did you pick for our listeners tonight?
4620912	4622814	Oh, Portopia!
4622874	4649586	Haha!
4651102	4654058	I don't think that's where the name came from.
4655354	4656215	I'll go with it.
4657578	4667574	Anyway, you have to solve murder mysteries by going and looking for clues and exploration, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles.
4667594	4671641	It's a first-person perspective, non-linear, and an open world.
4671661	4681176	You have conversations with NPCs, branching dialogue choices, interrogations, plot twists, and again, non-linear storytelling.
4681156	4689906	The Famicom version also has a command menu system, point-and-click interface, and a 3D dungeon maze.
4690166	4703681	It was a very well-received series and quite influential on designers, specifically Kojima and Aonuma.
4705743	4707805	Anyway...
4707785	4711211	You have various events that are going to unfold.
4711912	4715659	You've got still pictures with messages, you know, old school adventure game.
4716320	4724293	And you interact with the game using a verb-noun parser, so you have to be very precise in typing your commands with the keyboard.
4725876	4731666	In fact, some people say that finding the words you need to type are part of the riddles to solve.
4731646	4738277	and there are sound effects but there's no music and a save function.
4739218	4742624	So like I said before you do have branching dialogue choices.
4743405	4749655	The story develops through entering those commands and getting answers from either your sidekick or NPCs.
4749635	4755644	and you can achieve your objectives at different times in different directions.
4755684	4767762	It's very free that way and it's an open world and as you make your choices it determines dialogue and the order of events as well as getting alternative endings when you identify the culprit.
4768872	4771596	Only one of the characters in the game is the true culprit.
4771636	4781189	Although there are red herrings, you know, you can close the case with the wrong culprit and you will face criticism from the police chief and have to reopen the case.
4782772	4789021	You have a phone that you can dial any number which you need to contact NPCs.
4790443	4798474	You also have an inventory system that requires examination and collection of the items and you use this as evidence later in the game.
4798454	4805046	For the Famicom version, since there was no keyboard, you had the menu with 14 set commands.
4807370	4822437	And this actually, you know, that system was in one of the later, I guess, kind of sequel games that Hori did called the Hokkaido Serial Murder Case, the Oktos Disappearance.
4822417	4830764	which came out in 1984 and it was right in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia.
4832966	4837470	You had a point and click interface that you could use as a command using your D-pad as a cursor.
4837490	4840272	You look around for clues and hot spots.
4840713	4842134	Branching menu selections.
4842154	4843655	This is again the Famicom version.
4844176	4852423	Additional sequences, an underground dungeon maze that was very RPG-like in its style.
4852403	4862223	The story itself is fictional, but it's set in real Japanese cities, mainly Kobe.
4863826	4874327	In addition to their sequences in Kyoto and Sumoto, the president of a bank company, his name is Yamakawa Kozo,
4874307	4881520	is found dead by his secretary, Sawaki Fumie, inside a locked room in his mansion.
4882942	4887811	The signs look like Kozo stabbed himself, but the police still want an investigation.
4888452	4897227	Your detective you play is an unseen silent protagonist and is simply just called Boss.
4897207	4905102	He has an assistant named Mano Yasuhiko, who is nicknamed Yasu, who is the only one who actually speaks and executes your commands.
4905884	4907327	You have other characters.
4907507	4908870	There's Yukiko.
4910453	4914681	She's the daughter of a man named Hirata.
4914921	4919350	There's Kozo's nephew and heir and Okoi, who is a dancer.
4919330	4934892	and it goes on from there so the game was conceived in 1981 by Hori when he was 27 right after he bought his first computer and learned to program by modifying other games um
4934872	4956745	and basically he went from being influenced by other text adventure games and manga artists Chiba Tetsuya, Adachi Mitsuru and Otomo Katsuhiro and the game was built in basic so moving on from there was very innovative game in the in the genre
4956725	4978294	and it became very very popular so there were many various ports as I said there was the Famicom port in 1985 and it was the first adventure game to be released on the Famicom and it also was a collaboration between Hori and Nakamura Koichi of Chunsoft before Dragon Quest came out
4978628	4985397	Nakamura was 19 when the Famicom version was published.
4988701	4994548	Like I said, the Famicom used a menu system from a follow-up game, Hokkaido Serial Murder Case.
4998293	5000856	As far as...
5001376	5013767	His system that he developed, he noted that the Famicom version for both Portopia and Hokkaido, that he wanted them to be appealing to a mature audience as opposed to the younger audience.
5014688	5018391	He was also playing Wizardry at the time, so that's why he put in the 3D dungeon maze.
5019592	5031383	It was never released in the West because of its mature content, which basically included themes like murder, suicide, fraud, bankruptcy, interrogation, beatings, drug dealings, and a strip club.
5031363	5040302	The lack of a Western release did lead to some ROM hacking groups, so there were unofficial translations for the Famicom.
5041665	5047718	There was a mobile phone version of the game that was branded as part of the Horyuji Gekkijou,
5047698	5050683	as in Yuji Horii Theater.
5051645	5060341	And it had mobile versions of the Hokkaido serial murder case and Karuizawa Yuki Anai.
5061824	5064909	It was released in 2003 on EasyWeb and Yahoo!
5064929	5066432	Keitai Service.
5066412	5071817	It had mostly the Famicom system, but improved graphics, no free moving cursor.
5072918	5074039	It had a save function.
5076481	5082727	The trilogy there was re-released in 2005-2006 on the same services.
5082747	5096419	The second Portopia version was basically just like the first of the mobile series, but also had updated graphics, background music, and a bonus function that you could get after completing the game, and a hint option.
5096399	5099878	but it nullifies the ending bonus if you use it too much.
5100432	5114672	The game also was featured as Square Enix's AI technology preview for GDC 2023 for natural language processing, including the functions like natural language understanding and natural language generation.
5115232	5125807	A public version was released worldwide on April 24, 2023 without the natural language generation features because they didn't want inappropriate content being created.
5126368	5128110	It wasn't received very well.
5128630	5149272	the Famicom version sold very well, 700,000 copies and they really liked the twist ending it was a game without a game over because there was technically no way to lose it was the first real detective adventure game according to Square Enix
5149403	5156373	and it influenced many later games including Metal Gear and Snatcher.
5157995	5169150	In fact, the PC-6001 version of Portopia was a Hidden Secret and Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain.
5169130	5188540	it was one of the first games Aonuma ever played of course he went on to do the Legend of Zelda series starting with Ocarina of Time it had influenced games like Dragon Quest it influenced the whole visual novel genre in fact
5188520	5190082	Lots of different things.
5190402	5198873	It was ranked 19th in a poll to determine the 30 best Famicom games by the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography in 2003.
5199053	5204279	Retro Gaming Times Monthly even featured it.
5204339	5205741	It's an English language magazine.
5206162	5210627	And compared it to Shadowgate very similarly.
5211308	5217075	Other games, Deja Vu, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors,
5217055	5222033	Police Quest, Sherlock Holmes games, I mean, and even L.A.
5222053	5224722	Noire seemed to be influenced by the game.
5225124	5226649	So, there you go.
5227071	5228837	The Portopia Serial Murder Case.
5229762	5230743	Wow, alright.
5230984	5232906	Quite a neat pick.
5233147	5235390	I don't remember anything like this ever being released over here.
5235450	5237172	It wasn't.
5237793	5241659	I know it wasn't, but anything like it, even.
5242219	5244583	Maybe like a Shadowgate is the closest thing I can think of.
5245164	5255077	And Shadowgate was more fantasy, but it had some very similar... There's definitely a nod there, I'll put it that way.
5255218	5256600	Yeah, for sure.
5257381	5259043	Alright, awesome pick.
5259277	5259738	All right.
5260038	5265404	Well, we are going to cover a few other headlines here real fast, and then we're going to get to the Lister Roundtable before too long.
5265525	5269810	I don't think we have emails tonight, which is funny because we had a couple last week, but not tonight.
5269830	5274476	But if you want to send us emails for a future week, participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to do it.
5275196	5281244	We will also take calls potentially in our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.
5282285	5283867	Just...
5283847	5285489	Join our Discord and talk to us throughout the week.
5285509	5287711	There's been a lot of great conversation happening in Discord lately.
5287831	5291195	A lot of updates on game projects and other things going on.
5291215	5293498	I get a lot of great insight from you all throughout the week over there.
5293518	5296101	So just appreciate our Discord community for sure.
5296681	5298563	And Rinmari, keep posting the updates about Gradius.
5298683	5299825	I like Gradius too.
5301046	5302147	You have my full permission.
5302488	5303188	Shmup away.
5303309	5303889	Shmup away.
5304370	5307373	Alright, let's go to Rapid Fire News.
5307623	5310327	Give me a new Parodius game, please.
5310387	5316617	Check the Discord, because there was something announced this week at the Shum Shmup Fest or something.
5317798	5321885	There's like four YouTubes that they posted, and it's in there.
5323647	5324208	Nice.
5324228	5324468	Yeah.
5325250	5325530	All right.
5326371	5328194	Let's do some other headlines real quick.
5328234	5328855	Loki.
5329342	5339658	So we got word that there's going to be a new multiplayer mode added to the Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, the 4K remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.
5340680	5346789	And it makes sense because, you know, a lot has changed since back then with multiplayer.
5347450	5350274	So now they have a brand new mode that takes place online.
5350335	5351957	It's called Fox Hunt.
5351937	5378822	DarkSakura
5380591	5382915	I'm excited about this.
5383095	5387263	Earthion is coming to Switch on July 31st, 2025.
5388084	5390428	Limited Run Games put out a trailer for it.
5390448	5391510	It looks really fun.
5393053	5398422	It's basically an old, you know, kind of pixel game from Yuzo Koshiro.
5399364	5403932	And the music is great, and the game looks pretty, and I'm really looking forward to playing it.
5405279	5406822	All right.
5406922	5415781	And in sad news this week, it was brought to light that Masahiro Oki unfortunately passed away some time ago on October 6th of 2024.
5416021	5421212	You may not recognize that name right off the bat, but they used a stage name that...
5421192	5431821	Benton Maru was the stage name used, and they were the composer of Edge of Soul, which of course was the iconic theme song for Soul Blade.
5431901	5436425	Unfortunately, Benton Maru passed away back in 2024.
5436446	5442251	So we're really, I mean, this was revealed by his wife on Facebook after a battle with illness.
5442591	5443972	Nothing else was really said there.
5444693	5450558	But the reason why we're only finding out about this now is that the word traveled through a former band name, Mickey,
5450538	5454864	who had, I guess, in interviews and comments had gotten the word out.
5454884	5457447	So it's kind of traveling around social media and gaming blogs this week.
5457908	5463735	So unfortunately, yeah, very, very epic gaming composer who has passed on.
5463855	5464877	So rest in peace.
5465197	5467080	That's such a good song too.
5469263	5469543	All right.
5470304	5474149	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates for some games coming out real soon.
5475260	5476782	Yeah, it's like, what year is this?
5476843	5482692	Because we have Gex Trilogy coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5483012	5487359	I'm sorry, Loki, I have to interrupt because again, I'm watching this clusterfuck of a game behind you.
5487380	5488902	Not this rally.
5489002	5494651	Not this very obvious parody rally happening in this game behind you right now.
5494671	5495533	Help.
5495553	5497195	Except this one's actually well attended.
5500300	5500761	Sorry, Loki.
5502563	5505408	Yeah, I don't know.
5506029	5507592	Anyways, let's see.
5507672	5516427	So we've got, other than Gex Trilogy, a revival recolonization on Xbox One and Xbox Series.
5516447	5521756	Date everything on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5521776	5522517	I'll sure try.
5522537	5522918	I need to get this.
5524214	5529546	FBC Firebreak on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5529566	5531229	That's the Control Universe game.
5531249	5531871	I want to play that.
5532192	5533735	One of my friends really wants me to try this, yeah.
5535078	5542915	Lost in Random, The Eternal Die on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5542895	5572497	We have Scum coming out of Early Access on PC Shadowverse Worlds Beyond on PC, iOS, and Android Songs of Conquest on Nintendo Switch Tron Catalyst on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Hell Clock on PC Broken Arrow on PC Fruit Bus on PlayStation 5
5572578	5591886	Hungry Meme on PC and Nintendo Switch Raito Remastered The Mystery of the Soulless Army on PC, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Rematch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series
5591967	5616102	Robots at Midnight on PC and Xbox Series Sea Fantasy on Nintendo Switch Spray Paint Simulator on Nintendo Switch Star Overdrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC Vessels of Decay on PC, Mac, and Linux Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series And that is it
5618005	5618586	All right.
5619127	5621912	We're going to go over and check out some release dates in Japan.
5622833	5626680	We're going to check out the Switch 2 starts us off this week.
5626780	5628543	Same thing that Loki read in one of the U.S.
5628864	5635575	Japan is also getting Raidou Remastered, The Mystery of the Soulless Army, which is an Atlus game that's getting a remaster, and that is coming to Switch 2.
5635555	5655842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5655822	5657584	It's that Cho Aniki series.
5658185	5659005	It sure is.
5659025	5662269	By the way, I have to point this out because this kind of cracks me up, all right?
5662649	5667455	So I'm on a popular retailer's website that imports a lot of games from Japan.
5667555	5668155	It's PlayAsia.
5668816	5672260	And, you know, here's the game, the Cho Aniki, and you can see all the screenshots and stuff.
5672280	5673501	But that's not what I want to point out.
5673541	5676044	What I want to point out is that they actually have an icon here.
5676124	5678266	It says, not subject to U.S.
5678346	5678767	tariffs.
5679167	5680949	So they let you know that the game is going to be $29.
5681049	5682851	It's not subject to tariffs.
5682871	5684513	But the way they market...
5684493	5693490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5696963	5697364	Alright.
5698145	5698565	I love it.
5698685	5699907	Where were we?
5699927	5701109	Score one for PlayAsia.
5701129	5703993	Alright, Hungry Meme is out this week as well.
5704013	5707678	I said Toki no Kizuna for Nintendo Switch.
5707738	5709400	If I said that already, sue me.
5710282	5713867	And then Raidou Remastered is also on the original Switch as well.
5713887	5718313	I know you're all excited about Barbie Project Friendship, which also releases on June 19th.
5718293	5723842	and Last Time I Saw You is a game also releasing on the 19th.
5723922	5728189	Let's check quickly the PlayStation 5 where Spidersaurus is out there as well.

5787171	5794018	Rematch for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, The Smurfs, Flower Defense for the MetaQuest.
5795079	5796360	Really?
5796340	5823816	Star Overdrive for PC, PS5, Xboxes, Spray Paint Simulator for Switch, Through the Nightmares, PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Architect Life, the house design simulator for all the things, for PC, Broken Arrow, for all the things again, Chronicles of the Wolf, on the 20th, Benny Bash for PC, After Light Phase for PC, BitCraft Online for PC, and Hexitin on PC.
5825264	5828748	Alright, we just have one news story for you left to go.
5828788	5842364	I'm going to turn it over to Loki, but first I'm going to admit I purposely put this at the end of the show.
5843886	5844987	Because I'm sick of this guy.
5845648	5848110	But it's worth noting the update.
5848651	5850293	So fine, Loki, take it away.
5851572	5864312	So we had 1047 Games CEO and co-founder Ian Prolux talking about this whole make FPS great again hat debacle thing.
5865934	5869800	It's really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise.
5869966	5872489	and they didn't think it would really have an impact.
5872509	5879677	But then he, of course, goes out to make a formal apology for doing this.
5879737	5884663	It says, we did not intend for this to be taken political in any way whatsoever.
5885004	5885804	I am not an idiot.
5886005	5887887	Obviously, that's to be debated.
5888568	5891131	Obviously, I knew there would be some level of controversy.
5891391	5892372	Well, hold on a second.
5892452	5895356	You just said that there was not going to be any controversy.
5895756	5897458	That's what you just said.
5897708	5899932	And now you're saying that there was going to be controversy?
5900773	5902135	Hmm, interesting.
5902256	5913495	Anyways, we are disappointed with the state of the genre, and so we took it as a meme and thought it would be not nearly as received the way it was.
5914476	5917501	How are you, like, upset at the state of the genre?
5917542	5920206	Because your game's not really pushing anything.
5920186	5948387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5948367	5966865	NanoSwarm NanoSwarm NanoSwarm
5967031	5969574	You don't say, the $80 video game, here we are.
5969594	5973738	$80, and then of course people started asking us.
5973758	5974980	That's a skin pack.
5975000	5976141	Yeah, so what's going on?
5976181	5979925	I've had a lot of people ask me, how the hell did this happen in the first place?
5979945	5982528	Like an $80 bundle, that's not the 1047 way.
5983089	5986913	I agree, and I thought I would just candidly tell you exactly what happened.
5986973	5994962	So I'll start by saying, no excuse of course, I should have been on this, and we should have been on top of this.
5994942	6000449	How are you, as the CEO of this company, not aware of what's going on in your own company?
6000910	6005876	The second I got off stage, I called Derek, our lead game designer, and I said, Derek, what did you do?
6006216	6014867	The second he got off stage, if he knew about it, if he didn't know about it, then he couldn't have made that call the second he got off the stage.
6015268	6021516	Because the second he got off the stage, maybe he was told about it, and then two seconds after he got off the stage, he could have made the call.
6021536	6023498	But the math ain't mathin', buddy.
6023731	6025635	Yeah, as well, did you know we had an $80 bundle?
6025676	6026798	This sounds like news to me.
6027139	6029665	Once again, you are the CEO of your company.
6030066	6033474	The fact that you don't know what's going on in your company about their game... You have to sign off on this shit.
6033494	6034777	Like, you have to sign off on this stuff.
6034797	6036722	Like, how did you not know this was happening?
6037624	6038145	Um...
6038497	6040098	I didn't make any sense whatsoever.
6040138	6048265	Essentially what happened is our former head of monetization who happens to come from Call of Duty Okay, well Call of Duty is not a company.
6048326	6049707	Call of Duty is a game, sir.
6050988	6054050	Was with us for less than a year and was very aggressive on price.
6054591	6060136	Actually prior to his departure, originally had a founder's pack for $100 and battle passes for $10.
6060176	6064640	That was the first thing that Derek and I did when we re-evaluated the game.
6064940	6066541	I'm going to put the blame on other people.
6066581	6067142	That's right.
6067162	6068503	Everybody in the industry knows.
6068483	6091015	This guy will throw you under the bus.
6090995	6094080	I'm sorry, you're an idiot.
6094100	6096444	So, I don't understand.
6096604	6098567	But basically it says, yeah, it fell through the cracks somehow.
6098968	6103695	How did it fall through the cracks when you just said that you were evaluating these prices a month ago?
6103715	6107141	So, how are you unaware of it if you were aware of it a month ago?
6107161	6108463	It doesn't make any sense.
6111464	6116951	I think that you just did the thing, people got angry at you, and now you're trying to save face because your game sucks.
6116971	6121556	Trying to blame all of the people in the room that came up with this idea or whatever.
6121656	6123799	Trying to blame the person with the pricing.
6123819	6131268	Trying to blame... Did he, and maybe I missed it, did he blame himself in any of this?
6131288	6131588	No.
6131668	6135733	Well, he says... I'll start by saying...
6135713	6137098	No excuse, of course.
6137238	6139004	I should have been on this.
6139024	6140770	I should have been on top of this.
6140790	6141472	No excuse.
6142255	6144803	But I have some excuses ready to go.
6145486	6146770	I have some excuses.
6147273	6151919	I called it no excuse, so therefore those aren't excuses.
6152660	6153722	I'm going to say this.
6155484	6163475	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, while I blame the guy, he had a whole staff idea tank who also backed him on this bad idea.
6163695	6167140	Okay, I want to ask one question.
6167501	6168162	Ian, are you out there?
6168202	6170244	Are you a fan of Orange Launch Radio?
6170264	6174310	I'm going to guess probably not, but yeah, let's just pretend for a minute.
6174290	6175372	Ian's listening to the show.
6175593	6178980	Because as we have found out, other CEOs apparently do listen to the show.
6179161	6180103	It happens.
6180123	6182187	So I'd like to have a conversation with Ian real quick.
6182207	6185274	I just want to ask you, Ian, I want to ask you one question.
6185835	6186396	One question.
6186777	6187379	And here's the thing.
6188060	6189904	You don't have to answer this question.
6189924	6190285	You don't.
6190966	6192269	You don't have to answer this question.
6192730	6194053	But I'm going to ask it anyway.
6195063	6208219	When you were in that room coming up with this great idea, really novel idea on how to be so edgy at Summer Games Fest on how to stick out with this game.
6208239	6219653	When you were in the room with all of those people coming up with this idea, was everybody else in the room with you a cis, hetero, white guy of similar upbringing?
6221388	6222209	Were they conscious?
6222970	6226774	Again, I don't expect an answer to that question.
6226794	6228756	I just would like you to stew on that for a little bit.
6228776	6229157	That's all.
6229497	6233121	And maybe the answer would surprise me, in fact.
6233141	6238728	But I would also then ask the follow-up question of how much did you listen?
6240810	6244234	And that's all I'm going to say.
6244254	6246737	Speaking of listening... Was he even actually there?
6247949	6272016	well here's the funny the funny part about that like just real real fast like we know well like we don't have to have you make excuses about why it's $8 you made it $8 because you're trying to attract whales to your game and you want them to drop $80 on this when you have done nothing to sell people that this is even worth $80 worth of game like it's just it's stupid
6273802	6280749	All right, let's move on and let's take a second to listen to our listeners as they interact with us every week.
6280769	6282571	And we do have an email, so I stand corrected.
6282611	6286275	Participate at OrangetonTrader.com is the place to send those emails.
6286295	6289478	And DarkSakura is going to jump in.
6289498	6291180	Did I say one email?
6291460	6293342	I said two emails.
6293362	6293803	Hooray.
6293883	6294724	Ho, ho.
6295284	6296425	Yay, for once.
6297366	6299248	So I'll start off with the first one.
6299268	6301030	I'm just worried these are the same two.
6301170	6301851	Go ahead.
6302168	6309795	No, they're two different... Wait, wait, did you not remove, clean out the mailbox?
6309815	6310816	Not always.
6310836	6311056	Bob!
6312777	6313738	You know what?
6314779	6316100	Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
6316321	6318663	Let me look at the calendar, because we may still be in luck.
6318763	6319103	Okay.
6320104	6325969	Did you read one from... The last show was six... Eight was the last show.
6326269	6330373	Okay, and did you read one from a UK listener?
6331014	6331534	Yes.
6333151	6351118	Thanks for emailing us, people.
6351298	6352260	Please do it again.
6352580	6354383	And Carl, hi.
6355122	6363224	DJ Ranma S is asking me, so DJ Ranma S sent me a care package this week, which had some fun treats.
6363264	6364588	So this is the funny thing.
6364608	6365831	It was a box and it came.
6365871	6367275	What?
6368403	6369684	Oh, I have something to add to that.
6369765	6371246	It was a box that came from Japan.
6371587	6377193	And when I opened it, it was like Hershey's Oreo-ish looking cookies, we'll say for lack of a better term.
6377613	6378955	And I was like, oh, neat.
6378975	6380216	He sent cookies from Japan.
6380256	6380697	That's fine.
6381277	6384000	I have diabetes.
6384180	6390968	I can't really eat a lot of cookies, but I will save one for a special occasion when I'm going to be exercising after or something like that.
6390948	6394535	And then he was like, open the box when Alan gets home.
6394555	6395316	And I was like, what?
6395597	6398622	And then when I opened his, oh, it's not just cookies in here.
6398662	6402590	There's actually little rainbow Star Trek comm badge pins, which are super adorable.
6402610	6404092	So I was very thankful for that.
6404112	6407739	But then there actually, there was one cookie package still in there.
6408260	6410965	Alan ate it, but said it was good.
6410945	6436222	Dan and I were really excited by our gift because we have a little UFO catcher Ryoga and Ukyo from Ranma Nibunouchi.
6436663	6437243	Oh, cool.
6437544	6437644	Yeah.
6438248	6464863	when Dan and I were first friends online I had the screen named Dark Ukyo or Dark Uchan for a while and he had Dark Ryoga that's so adorable I'm gonna barf and they are still in my heart the OTP they should have ended up together and my headcanon says they did alright, fair enough
6465873	6469759	Alright, let's do some last minute stories here.
6470020	6473966	I actually have one I'd like to get into because I just found this one.
6474447	6475969	Well, and this is, it's a little different.
6476009	6484843	It's not a last minute story so much as it is, here I go again, get my soapbox, get it, because I gotta call somebody out, okay?
6484823	6486565	Here's who I'm calling out and why.
6486585	6493073	So I came across this headline, and it's from the website PC Gamer, which is usually a website that I'm pretty into.
6493654	6495236	But here's the headline.
6495816	6497598	Hello, games fans.
6497618	6505448	Enter the early stages of Silksong Syndrome after Light No Fire is a summer game fest no-show.
6505468	6511455	And it goes on to talk about how in 2023 the game was announced, all this stuff.
6511435	6513559	I think you know where I'm going with this.
6513579	6515221	This is fucking dangerous what you're doing.
6515422	6515843	Stop it.
6516644	6517525	Stop it.
6517545	6518928	This is dangerous what you're doing.
6519208	6527082	Because literally, this tells me, do you have amnesia as to what happened with No Man's Sky?
6527502	6535536	Did you forget what happened in that situation and how we got to that situation?
6535516	6549087	and it was that massive hype machine building up towards a game that did not meet the hype machine that caused that game to have issues that we are still talking about years after its release.
6550180	6551322	Excuse me?
6551342	6556389	You're going to run this headline about this studio after that experience?
6556749	6567605	And to be quite frank, I don't think you should be running a headline like this on any studio because this is just going to discourage game makers to finish.
6567625	6570309	They need to finish games before putting them out.
6572111	6573273	What are you doing?
6573293	6573994	Stop it.
6576050	6577875	There's no story here.
6577995	6581204	The story is there were no announcements.
6581224	6583791	So we always joke about an announcement of an announcement.
6584052	6585014	Well, now here we go.
6585115	6587140	An announcement of no announcements.
6588301	6590544	Let them fucking cook their game.
6591225	6594809	When it is done and in a state you can see it, you will see it.
6595490	6606204	I get that Silksong is a meme for all other sorts of reasons, and Microsoft's kind of feeding that one, but for what it's worth, the same rules apply.
6607125	6609108	Leave them alone.
6609128	6612452	They will give you the information when the game is ready.
6613934	6621162	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says you're tanking a game just for the sake of you wanting to get into Silksong News search lines.
6621923	6622743	100%.
6622764	6626968	This is a website that usually does better and I expect to do better.
6627789	6628570	That was crap.
6631393	6632454	That's my last minute story.
6632474	6634016	Hopefully you have something more positive, Loki.
6635537	6636939	I have nothing.
6637760	6639942	We'll leave it on a ranty note.
6641069	6649746	I was just trying to remember all the bookmarking stuff or wishlisting stuff on Steam just as part of NexFest going on right now.
6650608	6653394	I saw that the demo for Dispatch came out and that looks awesome.
6653574	6654656	Oh.
6654676	6655357	Remember that one?
6655618	6655959	Yeah.
6655999	6658183	Where you're dispatching superheroes?
6658163	6674721	I need to see if you can still sign up for that game that looked like Clue or Knives Out I want to see if that one had a demo because Square Enix sent an email on that I want to see if we can still get into that and then that Mixtape game
6674701	6675462	looked really neat.
6675482	6676764	I want to see if there's a demo for that.
6676844	6677686	That looks good.
6678407	6681812	I got, what was the other two that I just bookmarked?
6681852	6683094	Neon Inferno.
6683475	6684516	Definitely look that up.
6684536	6685938	It's like a Contra-looking game.
6686299	6687501	Looks amazing.
6687521	6694992	And then Space Adventure Cobra, which is done in a style of some 80s anime type thing.
6695032	6696234	I don't know if it's an actual anime.
6696294	6697797	Cobra is an 80s anime.
6698498	6701182	And it's really badass.
6701202	6701282	Yes.
6701431	6718832	Cobra, Urasayatsura
6720787	6721888	All right.
6721908	6725472	Well, with all that news, we are at the end of the show.
6725492	6727915	So we want to thank everybody for listening to our program.
6728255	6730558	We hope you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6730578	6740990	If you're feeling so generous, a nice five-star review on a site where you found this podcast, such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show, all of that love goes an extra long way to helping grow our audience.
6741350	6742591	Tell a friend or two about the show.
6742631	6746876	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6746916	6749359	So we really appreciate that.
6749339	6754025	Thank you, as always, for being here live or on the podcast, however you listen to the show.
6754045	6754685	We appreciate you.
6755046	6765558	Reminder, we're not here next week, so we'll see you once again on June 29th, where we will be celebrating turning 23 years old as a show, if you can believe it or not.
6765578	6766619	So, yeah.
6766820	6769002	Maybe I might do some Claire Obscure next week.
6769022	6769943	Ooh, fun.
6770043	6771465	Oh, like when the show would usually be on?
6772289	6775113	Yeah, or maybe as Nick says, wee-wee baguette.
6775233	6776675	All right.
6777917	6778678	That does it for the show.
6778718	6779579	Let's get final thoughts.
6779759	6781321	And DarkSakura, I assume you're going to stream.
6781341	6782102	What are you streaming tonight?
6782182	6783724	You going to do Debbie or you going to play something?
6783744	6784085	It's Mass Effect.
6784105	6785026	Mass Effect, cool.
6785086	6787590	Mass Effect is much easier for me to do with this short time.
6787610	6789532	I can only get a couple of games in on DVD.
6790253	6800227	So Mass Effect is easy for me to find like a pausing spot, you know, instead of, do I want to do one more game and then have it be a Legion match that lasts five hours?
6800247	6801048	All right.
6801088	6802009	Final thought tonight.
6803187	6806996	Um, no kings, just queens.
6808279	6808600	All right.
6809162	6810685	Have a good one, DarkSakura.
6810806	6811467	Good night.
6811547	6811828	Good night.
6812911	6814495	All right, Loki, we'll go over to you then.
6814555	6816319	What is your final thought for tonight?
6816890	6820135	I guess I did have a technically last minute story.
6820716	6825362	Real fast, I was going to say, Stellar Blades sold 1 million copies on PC, which is amazing.
6825823	6835838	And I think because of that game selling so well, they've also removed the region restrictions for the other games that required Sony online logins, that type of thing.
6837500	6838662	That's good.
6838642	6838962	Good.
6840203	6842746	My final thought for tonight is happy Pride.
6843487	6855678	I marched in the Pride Parade today with the local horror cult movie contingent, like Rocky Horror and stuff, and I was handing out flyers for a show next week, which sadly I'm not even going to, but I want them to be successful.
6855718	6859662	Of course I do, because we're going to have a Halloween show, and I've loved this group for a long time.
6859742	6862665	So yeah, I was happy to be in the Pride Parade today and see so many people turn out.
6863005	6866168	So it made my heart full of rainbows.
6866148	6867971	and May Your Heart Be Full of Rainbows as well.
6868031	6869513	Have a wonderful week, everybody.
6869533	6870455	Have a wonderful two weeks.
6870835	6875082	We will see you back here in two weeks for our next show on June 20th.
6875122	6876344	I say 26th, I meant 29th.
6876624	6878186	June 29th will be our next show.
6878206	6880149	That's 15 plus 14 is nine.
6880570	6882353	So we will see you on June 29th.
6882713	6884676	Until then, have a wonderful week, everybody.
6885157	6886259	We will see you next time.
6886319	6886519	Bye.
6889183	6891767	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6893519	6922092	See you next week.
