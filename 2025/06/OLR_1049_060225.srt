1
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Hideo Kojima's career section on Wikipedia runs full circle.

2
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:17,033
[SPEAKER_06]: The film-trained, film-producing hopeful is finally making a movie and for one of his own creations.

3
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that isn't news.

4
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:19,896
[SPEAKER_06]: We've known that since 2023.

5
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Presumably its production wasn't as active along Death Stranding 2's production, but that is now an impending release.

6
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,584
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the anime adaptation is news.

7
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep on keeping on, Norman Reedus.

8
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:34,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

9
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:36,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

11
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:48,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:51,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:51,138 --> 00:01:00,547
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live once again with episode number 1049 of our show for tonight, June the 1st of 2025.

14
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,011
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined every week by my co-hosts.

15
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello, first and foremost, to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:13,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I?

17
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:14,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, there you are now.

18
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:15,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

19
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:16,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I said hi.

20
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:17,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

21
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:18,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it didn't come through.

22
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:20,423
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing?

23
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:22,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Tired.

24
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:22,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,832
[SPEAKER_04]: At ballet rehearsal.

26
00:01:24,273 --> 00:01:28,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We have recital next week, so...

27
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:51,612
[SPEAKER_07]: It certainly was fun.

28
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:58,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to watch Jamie drink a very dark beer that made her feel a little fuzzy right off the bat.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

30
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:03,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I have a shortened digestive system.

31
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:08,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, Mishi.

32
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Mishi, wish me good luck at the ballet recital.

33
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you'll get that.

34
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:14,578
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll get that.

35
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:20,200
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing The Witch's Road from Agatha All Along.

36
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:21,522
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun choice.

37
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're doing Dancing Through Life from Wicked.

38
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:26,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard.

39
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:27,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

40
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be fun.

41
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:32,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing the legit movie choreography for the last part of the song.

42
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:33,878
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really cool.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hard.

44
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:37,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, nice.

45
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,208
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

46
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:42,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

47
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:43,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how are you, Loki?

48
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:43,992
Hey.

49
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:45,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty good.

50
00:02:45,243 --> 00:02:45,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

51
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:46,810
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your weekend?

52
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's normal.

53
00:02:50,102 --> 00:03:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It's short.

54
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:23,707
[SPEAKER_07]: and Loki has these games that play behind him while we are broadcasting and I don't recognize this one.

55
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,519
[SPEAKER_07]: It says to a T. Oh, is this the new one from the Katamari guy?

56
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it kind of looks like it.

57
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:33,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

58
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:34,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen that on Game Pass.

59
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:36,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about that.

60
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you played it at all?

61
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:38,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.

62
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, all right.

63
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:41,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's adorable.

64
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,552
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll have to get more of your thoughts a little later when we get into our gaming weeks.

65
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,479
[SPEAKER_07]: But first off, we need to get into the news for this week.

66
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll get into our kickoff topic.

67
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very interesting week we're sitting at here because we are really on the eve of a big week.

68
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:00,873
[SPEAKER_07]: The Switch 2 is going to launch this week.

69
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Switch 2 comes out on Thursday.

70
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:03,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So I...

71
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:07,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the last time we sat here on the eve of a system launch.

72
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been like 2020 and that year was fucking weird to begin with.

73
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:21,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So this really feels like the first time in a very long time we're sitting here with people actually going to be going to the store to pick up Best Buy or wherever to pick up their consoles or maybe having it delivered though.

74
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazon didn't get in on the Switch 2 thing.

75
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:24,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they've had some fighting.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting, this whole new console feeling.

77
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:32,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Friday...

78
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:52,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Summer Game Fest Summer Game Fest

79
00:04:52,222 --> 00:05:11,800
[SPEAKER_07]: and so we're expected to get a lot of announcements out of that now of course Microsoft's doing their own thing too we have a couple other companies we'll get to that later on but we expect that there'll be quite a few announcements on Friday so this is a very big week for games so even though it didn't slow the news down for this week but we still have a lot of things to talk about but I know the Switch 2 is on everybody's mind right Loki?

80
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:13,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

81
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:27,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why, of course, people are paying attention to a Russian YouTuber who has allegedly already gotten their hands on a physical console.

82
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, I mean, that makes sense.

83
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:30,829
[SPEAKER_05]: They're out there already in the wild.

84
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, if retailers break street date, then...

85
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:58,577
[SPEAKER_05]: you know that you can get it so uh they've already been showing off what the console can do uh and that is not much because it needs a day one patch in order for it to actually unlock the console and allow it to play games using the cartridges and stuff like that but we got to see some menus so cool i guess um

86
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:00,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, menu.

87
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:03,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Menus, and it looks like the Switch.

88
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

89
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:12,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat, I guess, but also it's not super early.

90
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:16,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's next week or this week, so I don't know.

91
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:21,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm less excited about it, but yeah, it is weird.

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

93
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it makes sense to lock the console or whatever.

94
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:31,365
[SPEAKER_05]: It does kind of suck though for the people that maybe don't have good internet or something like that.

95
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:41,203
[SPEAKER_05]: You might not be able to play any games on it until you connect it to the internet but we live in the age of the internet so I guess it makes sense.

96
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but it's also interesting.

97
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:53,348
[SPEAKER_07]: What about for people that aren't going to have internet accessibility, but I assume maybe either the date is hard coded or perhaps, uh, there's a lot of talk about that.

98
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:58,074
[SPEAKER_07]: The early switch to games, which, you know, the few that are physical.

99
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:05,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So what Mario Kart world and maybe one or two others, uh, will have some sort of firmware update in it or some sort of unlock.

100
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:05,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

101
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

102
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:06,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

103
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,565
[SPEAKER_07]: This is probably very small.

104
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:12,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably more like a key that unlocks everything sort of thing.

105
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,574
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, yeah.

106
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:17,498
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, the system is kind of very online as well.

107
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess online isn't required, obviously, because it's portable.

108
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:24,909
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, so much of the game sales are now with these game key cards.

109
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:32,459
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like, I don't want to say internet connection is mandatory, but it's feeling pretty close.

110
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but it is.

111
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:35,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

112
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,890
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the direction that the industry is going.

113
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it.

114
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing is, if you don't like it, you have options, so...

115
00:07:42,895 --> 00:08:08,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

116
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,315
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but you have a point.

117
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:17,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Games don't leak when they are on this keycard download thing because you won't be able to download it until the official release.

118
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So it will stop games from leaking.

119
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:23,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess in that sense, but that's more of just like digital games.

120
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's Nintendo first party stuff, obviously.

121
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:27,386
[SPEAKER_07]: No, most likely not.

122
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we'll still see it happen there.

123
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:32,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But to what extent, who knows?

124
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:33,457
[SPEAKER_07]: It is interesting.

125
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:38,086
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any Mario Kart World footage outside of the official stuff and Treehouse and all that.

126
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have any leaks of that game yet.

127
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,939
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't anticipate there's going to be until the 5th of June.

128
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:53,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe the 4th because of time zones and Australia will be the first to get their go at it in that region.

129
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

130
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:57,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

131
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:58,713
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

132
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:03,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now, did you decide you're going to get a Switch 2, Loki, or no?

133
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Jamie wasn't going to get one.

134
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:05,421
[SPEAKER_07]: You are going to get one?

135
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:06,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

136
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:08,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan decided he wanted to keep his pre-order.

137
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:11,869
[SPEAKER_07]: We got two just to make sure I would get one, and Alan was like, I want to have one.

138
00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:13,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play it.

139
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:21,982
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's also super into the Elden Ring, Bloodborne stuff, and so there's that one game that's coming out on Switch 2 that's going to be, yeah, for that platform, and I know he wants to play that whenever it comes out.

140
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,523
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is reasons for it, but yeah.

141
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:24,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

142
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:28,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, we have one ordered, so as long as the retailers don't screw us.

143
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:33,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, I mean, no cancellation emails since we pre-ordered one month ago.

144
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hopefully everything's good.

145
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:39,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

146
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any point in getting one right now.

147
00:09:42,607 --> 00:10:08,715
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah that's fair there's not a lot of really like new games out the gate there's Mario Kart and like Donkey Kong isn't until next month I'm excited for the performance improvements to old games but I also understand that's not for everybody you know no I have not touched my Switch since other than playing Just Dance with the ballet group for Fuck It Friday yeah

148
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:31,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually excited to try in a weird way I'm excited to try Pokemon Scarlet again but I'm worried that maybe I'm setting my expectations for how it's going to fix the game a little high and the performance are probably going to be nominal at best and not really fix some of the real issues I have with that game but we'll see we'll see I'm going to try to have faith but I realize I may be disappointed

149
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:39,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what you're really forgetting is the true system seller for the Switch 2, and that is, of course, F-Zero GX.

150
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:43,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Being able to play that online with friends is going to be huge, actually.

151
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited for that.

152
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:47,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And Soul Calibur 2, quite frankly.

153
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of those are really exciting.

154
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:54,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, going to a chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night.

155
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:59,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Dolly Partner is in chat saying, I still am worried about the Switch 2 logo.

156
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It bothers me.

157
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:05,854
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I saw the post on Blue Sky about that too, where the logo is, it's just a giant 2.

158
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:11,805
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess there's only so many things you could do with it, but I get it, I get it.

159
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:18,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Rinmari in chat says, I did poke my Switch yesterday for an F-Zero community championship.

160
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:24,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, F-Zero is something I'm very hype about, the F-Zero GX.

161
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're talking about 99, but yeah, excited about that.

162
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for Animal Crossing, so that's it.

163
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:32,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that'll be huge.

164
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:38,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's one of those things where maybe we'll see it at Summer Game Fest, but I don't want to hype it too much.

165
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it might be a little early for that.

166
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a 3D Mario game.

167
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe fall, if anything, like a direct during the fall.

168
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:48,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine a

169
00:11:48,190 --> 00:12:17,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think an Animal Crossing would be next year at the earliest to be honest so it probably doesn't get announced till you know early next year but Nintendo would be foolish not to be working on one as we speak it was such a it sold such gangbusters I mean granted a worldwide pandemic really helped them with that and stay at home stuff but you know I think there's still enough of an audience well if you play your cards right again Nintendo you might get your second pandemic it's true

170
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they just discover their first measles cases here?

171
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,548
[SPEAKER_07]: They have so many options.

172
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,712
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

173
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:26,840
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to let you get a vaccine now.

174
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:32,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's whatever disease is going to come out of RFK from chugging shots of...

175
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:47,617
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

176
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:50,142
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

177
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect and Dead by Daylight, pretty much.

178
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:55,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Palia.

179
00:12:55,776 --> 00:13:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing a lot of Palia because I am working on a house on my new property that is entirely built in the air.

180
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, it's eight sets of stairs high with another two sets going to an upper loft.

181
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:21,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all also off of the property grid.

182
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Defying the laws of physics and property ownership.

183
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:27,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Because fuck their laws.

184
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck their boundaries and all of that.

185
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:36,833
[SPEAKER_04]: To hell with the landlord.

186
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:41,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Fruit Mountain because I love that stupid game.

187
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I really...

188
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:45,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

189
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm liking my same games.

190
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:49,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really been back into Mass Effect a lot.

191
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:58,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to be playing Mass Effect tonight instead of Dead by Daylight because I want to wait until the new stuff comes out, I think.

192
00:13:58,991 --> 00:13:59,532
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

193
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

194
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:05,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Mass Effect 2 is only one of the greatest games ever made, so not a bad choice at all.

195
00:14:05,306 --> 00:14:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Effect 3 is the best, but I'm on Mass Effect 2 right now.

196
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

197
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, playing them back-to-back really drives home just how much better the controls for Mass Effect 2 are, but it's a lot meaner, even in casual mode.

198
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:25,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm just playing it because, again, I just want to get to the Garrus dating part.

199
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,831
[SPEAKER_07]: The Garrus dating sim.

200
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

201
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still in the middle of calibrations, and I just want to smack him around and say, Stop!

202
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It's calibrated!

203
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:36,946
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

204
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:37,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll go over to Loki.

205
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:38,627
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

206
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:40,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all right.

207
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I did try to play a few things.

208
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:47,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Two of Tea is one that I did check out.

209
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:53,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I made it through the first one and a half episodes of it.

210
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:57,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they kind of bookend all the episodes with a little musical number.

211
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:26,539
[SPEAKER_05]: and it certainly does feel like it's out of the Katamari universe in fact it's funny the town itself that you're in initially it seems like it's like the end island of Katamari like I'm just waiting for the twist ending where this giant Katamari comes and just rolls up the whole island but wouldn't that be a gag though maybe that should happen it would be hilarious I don't think that's gonna happen since it's a different developer but um

212
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:45,928
[SPEAKER_05]: or different publisher I should say and so I don't think that they would be allowed to do that but that would be really funny so there was that and then I started up a campaign in Final Fantasy 3 or 6 essentially and I've been playing through that a little bit

213
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too far into that yet.

214
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also I ended up playing Smurfs for the ColecoVision just to show my kids how stupid of a game that was.

215
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,903
[SPEAKER_05]: The Smurfs Escape from Gargamel.

216
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, it's a really short game.

217
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can beat the whole game essentially in like a minute.

218
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It does get harder, though, as time goes on.

219
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:08,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's yeah, it's bad.

220
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And the emulation controls are not good either.

221
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:31,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

222
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:36,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, with some editing, you could have fixed all that.

223
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:40,556
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not much... Unless there was no mic audio.

224
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's what was missing.

225
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:43,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, okay.

226
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, yeah, the music itself just loops over and over.

227
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:48,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the jumping sound, so it really...

228
00:16:49,358 --> 00:17:11,839
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

229
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:13,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I played that.

230
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, lots of Minecraft.

231
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:20,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Put out my Cracker Barrel episode thing with that.

232
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a whole, like...

233
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:44,863
[SPEAKER_05]: you mean your legally distinct Cracker Barrel legally distinct Cracker Barrel yes yes yes highly inspired so I made that and put that video out and yeah now I just need to figure out what I'm going to do next because I don't know and probably lots of planning for the large project I'm going to be working on but content wise I don't know what I'm going to do right now

234
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:46,446
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

235
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:48,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then my gaming week.

236
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:49,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

237
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:53,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I also played a little bit of Hylia because I've, you know, suddenly become addicted to that.

238
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So making my way through that game.

239
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:01,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely don't have all the fancy shit that DarkSakura has, but I have a comfy...

240
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get there.

241
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:23,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get there.

242
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a separate island.

243
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:32,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a mechanic for the game that's very similar to some things they released in prior expansions, like Eureka.

244
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:40,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Bose Jan was the name of the one during, not Endwalker, but oh my gosh, everything's a blur with expansions now.

245
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Shadowbringers was the thing they put with that.

246
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:47,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have this new island and it's, you know, it's neat.

247
00:18:48,091 --> 00:18:53,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar in many ways, I think, to Eureka, but a little more streamlined.

248
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:58,289
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to worry about all the elemental stuff, but it's neat, but it's not very solo friendly.

249
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to admit, that's very disappointing.

250
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:05,279
[SPEAKER_07]: is that we just really haven't had that solo-friendly hardcore casual content.

251
00:19:05,499 --> 00:19:15,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Last expansion, we had the Island Sanctuary, which I found to be extremely friendly solo mid-core content that you could do and really get rewards from.

252
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And this, you can't really solo.

253
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:21,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can grind, but it's not really realistic.

254
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's definitely benefits to grouping up, except Party Finder doesn't work when you're in the zone.

255
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:41,554
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

256
00:19:41,534 --> 00:19:42,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say it.

257
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:46,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the Endwalker patches were not great with story, but at least the mechanics were decent.

258
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the weakest expansion, period.

259
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:58,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really hope that, you know, the 14 team is taking some of the feedback to light and is going to be instituting some changes with future expansions.

260
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:01,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, you know, just hope to see a little bit more.

261
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just don't understand why we couldn't have even had like an NPC that we could do stuff with.

262
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:05,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

263
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:06,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little bit...

264
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:24,045
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:30,992
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are saying MMOs are only to be played with other people and never to be played by yourself, guess what?

266
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,593
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a dated look.

267
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:35,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And the industry is saying very different things on that.

268
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how I feel about it.

269
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:49,530
[SPEAKER_07]: But interestingly enough, the right game came around at the right time to sort of scratch that interesting, I want to play an MMO, but I want to do it on my own schedule and by my own rules.

270
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's Fantasy Life came out.

271
00:20:51,532 --> 00:21:16,830
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

272
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should have waited for Switch 2.

273
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:22,919
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been a little bit even better on that, but it's still fine.

274
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:27,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I bought it yesterday and I've already put like six hours into the game.

275
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,228
[SPEAKER_07]: It's addicting.

276
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:29,808
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun.

277
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

278
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the DS version of the game.

279
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:34,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I never quite...

280
00:21:34,748 --> 00:21:53,398
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

281
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, damn.

282
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,544
[SPEAKER_07]: The treasure was a childhood picture of the... That's deep.

283
00:21:58,564 --> 00:21:59,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dark.

284
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:02,069
[SPEAKER_07]: It throws these things at you.

285
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:02,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat.

286
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm enjoying it.

287
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I need to unlock more of the jobs.

288
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,818
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's this whole side thing that's happening.

289
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:14,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does this whole Breath of the Wild thing where the world starts off very, very small.

290
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:17,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the world just explodes in size.

291
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:18,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, oh my gosh.

292
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, not to spoil, but these are all things that happen in the first couple hours of the game.

293
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm really, really enjoying it.

294
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:32,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will definitely be playing more of it, especially this week as we lead up to the eventual release of the Switch 2, which I know is coming.

295
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:33,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So very excited about that.

296
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:36,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, been playing quite a bit of Fantasy Life.

297
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:39,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my gaming week.

298
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:42,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into some more stories.

299
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick little housekeeping note before we do though.

300
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,430
[SPEAKER_07]: In three weeks, we won't be here live.

301
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:56,713
[SPEAKER_07]: June 22nd will not be here live because I will be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta, Georgia.

302
00:22:56,693 --> 00:23:23,545
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's my first of two trips this year because I'm going to DragonCon as well I did this a couple years ago and I really enjoyed Southern Fried and I was like you know I want to go back two trips a year is hard especially when it's so close together but this year because of like baseball play this venue where they have it at is like right across the freeway from where the Atlanta Braves play so when the Atlanta Braves have a game or something's going on at that stadium the hotel's full the parking lot's full all this stuff but

303
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:44,706
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

304
00:23:44,686 --> 00:24:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bobby and I, of course Bobby's there because that's his backyard But Bobby and I will be doing a panel And we're going to be doing a panel on classic games Obscure kind of classic games that have not gotten enough Because it is a classic gaming expo But like things that have not gotten enough love Like there's classic games that everybody knows about But what about the really obscure ones?

305
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:09,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well by the way, that reminds me

306
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I should mention this for my gaming week too, because I was at a friend's.

307
00:24:13,188 --> 00:24:16,917
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend has one of these, I think he bought it on Amazon or one of these things.

308
00:24:16,937 --> 00:24:18,601
[SPEAKER_07]: He has one of those arcade sticks, right?

309
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:23,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an arcade fighting stick, but it has a bunch of classic arcade games built in.

310
00:24:23,312 --> 00:24:25,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's of questionable legality.

311
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:25,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Pinterest box?

312
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:27,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's exactly what it is.

313
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Pandora's Box.

314
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:34,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what the splash screen says.

315
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:50,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've got one.

316
00:24:50,093 --> 00:25:19,999
[SPEAKER_07]: but we also played my friend was like oh let me show you this like hella weird obscure game I bet you've never heard of and it was Pepsi Man and I was like actually oh Pepsi Man actually thanks to our classic Game of the Week segment I have heard of this game before and so we played Pepsi Man which is it's like and even those of us that were kind of playing and watching were like this was like Temple Run's inspiration right here kinda it's one of those you know there's definitely a little bit of Sonic Adventure 2 but it's

317
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:20,660
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

318
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's well, I don't know if I should say it's great.

319
00:25:23,683 --> 00:25:27,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like it's it's cheesy movie.

320
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:27,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

321
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.

322
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,291
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

323
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:31,953
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's that it's that.

324
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:33,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I definitely recommend.

325
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:36,478
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, it makes it, though, is all the live action cuts.

326
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:37,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, 100 percent.

327
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:41,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm like, where is that strip mall today from the intro?

328
00:25:41,444 --> 00:25:46,550
[SPEAKER_07]: That just looked like a strip mall somewhere in like probably Woodland Hills or fucking Van Nuys or something.

329
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, where is that strip mall today?

330
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:48,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

331
00:25:48,532 --> 00:26:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: well on top of that just the original Pepsi Man commercials are hilarious so yes I had a good time with that game I'm trying to think if there's any other really obscure ones they were all playing this particular friend group of mine is really into fighting games and I will get into them once in a while but I don't I have to admit you guys I don't know them all so there is some game on PlayStation 5 that is I think based off an anime that is an up-dude version of a PlayStation 3 game

332
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:40,476
[SPEAKER_07]: and unfortunately and the characters have really funny names and like one of them shoots bubbles one of them shoots rockets from her tits like it's really funny like and that game was really fun to watch and unfortunately I could not tell you the name of it I bet if somebody shouts it out in chat I'll be like yes it was that so or I could text my friend and be like what was that game I'm gonna do that I'm gonna text my friend right now and be like what was that game we'll see if I get a response during the show

333
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now I really am done with my game of the week.

334
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:45,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I forgot the little classic nugget there.

335
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:47,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go to some more stories.

336
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play Segata Sanchiro?

337
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:52,687
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't that.

338
00:26:52,707 --> 00:26:54,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did watch a little bit.

339
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:56,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that wasn't the game that asked if you played it.

340
00:26:57,371 --> 00:27:08,221
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't play that, but I did watch Project Justice because that new Marvel Capcom collection, or excuse me, the new Capcom collection certainly came up with, you know, Capcom SNK and all that shit in it.

341
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:09,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, really good.

342
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Loki, you can go.

343
00:27:13,576 --> 00:27:17,163
[SPEAKER_05]: We got some more news regarding Pokemon Legends ZA.

344
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:31,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in October, and they are going to be charging $10 for the Switch 2 upgrade, which is pretty common according to all the other stuff that's been released out there for the Switch.

345
00:27:31,250 --> 00:28:00,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Switch 2 or those upgrades you know for the first gen stuff um along with that I guess so it looks like the 16th in Japan I'm not sure that also coincides with the 16th of October here as well in North America but maybe we'll see um and then along with that of course they also announced that the next uh Pokemon Presents is going to be July 22nd 2025 so look forward to that I guess and more news

346
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out about Pokemon.

347
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:09,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hope they drop a stealth update to updo Switch 1 Pokemon Legends for Switch 2, the Arceus.

348
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:10,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love that.

349
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:12,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to count on that, though.

350
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Legends was so good.

351
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.

352
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:18,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I might say, Derek, I say it's my favorite Pokemon game.

353
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:19,101
[SPEAKER_07]: It really was.

354
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really hyped for ZA.

355
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:21,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be buying that 100%.

356
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:24,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Really excited for that.

357
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:30,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But I finally stopped playing the trading card game that I was really into for a couple months.

358
00:28:31,122 --> 00:28:34,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of fell off the wagon for a few days, and then I just never brought it up again.

359
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:36,969
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know there's things to announce with that.

360
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's other things to announce too.

361
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Would it be time for a remake?

362
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:42,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might be.

363
00:28:42,716 --> 00:28:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the next thing that Pokemon would be due for, wouldn't it?

364
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,564
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Legends, and then next year there'll be a remake for Black and White.

365
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, would they do...

366
00:28:52,537 --> 00:29:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: more of like or even not even black and white would they do like um more of the early games like they redid for uh what was it the Eevee and Pikachu oh let's go let's go yeah there were always that rumors about like a gen 2 of that um I guess anything's possible but um I don't think that's on anyone's radar right now to be announced but that would be cute sure I mean I don't

367
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:43,485
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:29:43,465 --> 00:30:03,398
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't know if this is like a sense of false security they've been doing a lot of interesting things in Pokemon Go lately like they allowed people to give away a quest that they would usually charge 99 cents for for free as part of a event which was cute and then like Pikmin Bloom has been looking to a lot more corporate sponsorships lately

369
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:05,160
[SPEAKER_07]: to try to kind of maintain that game.

370
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,906
[SPEAKER_07]: They do a lot more local events or they might turn like a local event into a worldwide thing.

371
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:18,998
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I'm participating in the Hot Girl Walk, which starts tomorrow, which apparently is a real event like down in Santa Monica or something.

372
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:22,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But you are able to participate worldwide with the virtual Hot Girl Walk.

373
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,664
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course I'm participating.

374
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:25,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Get my hot girl on.

375
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:28,170
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, you know, that's something that

376
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It hasn't changed yet.

377
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,778
[SPEAKER_07]: And I completely understand all the reservations people have.

378
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Saudi Arabia, da-da-da.

379
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:35,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

380
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:42,190
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not going to rage quit those games until there is actually an action that substantiates the rage quit.

381
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to rage quit over a hypothetical.

382
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:46,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens.

383
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,299
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

384
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:50,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

385
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was it for Pokemon Legends then.

386
00:30:53,243 --> 00:31:23,183
[SPEAKER_07]: yes sure SG100 Matt does point out safe bet we'd see some Switch Online versions of classic games you know that is something we're missing and we haven't had in a while I mean we had the 3DS had the that's where like Pokemon Home kind of started you could do or it was called Pokemon Bank right you could play the classic games like Pokemon Yellow and then put your Pokemon in Pokemon Bank it would be nice if the Switch 2 would have something like that and that would be really cool if it was timed for Pokemon Legends maybe so that would be

387
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:27,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a neat little thing and maybe drive some more Pokemon Home subscriptions, but we'll see.

388
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's talk about...

389
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:31,413
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to say something?

390
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:32,515
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I said, yeah, that'd be a good idea.

391
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:33,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

392
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:35,520
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk about Dragon Quest.

393
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:44,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've been waiting a little bit now for the 1 and 2 HD 2D remake because, of course, last year brought us the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake and it did very well.

394
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:50,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this week it was announced that Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D will also be going to the Switch 2.

395
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,753
[SPEAKER_07]: They have confirmed they will be making a specific Switch 2 version.

396
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:54,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That is in addition...

397
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,577
[SPEAKER_07]: to a Switch version of the game.

398
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,685
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PC and all that good stuff.

399
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:06,032
[SPEAKER_07]: $60 is the price and it will be out on October 30th.

400
00:32:06,372 --> 00:32:18,651
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are feeling extra spendy, you can get the exclusive collector's edition exclusively through the Square Enix store for just $150.

401
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:42,478
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

402
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,902
[SPEAKER_07]: You get in-game items.

403
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:47,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You get exclusive digital wallpapers.

404
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, ah.

405
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:52,434
[SPEAKER_07]: And a very vague pre-order bonus, which really could be anything.

406
00:32:52,454 --> 00:33:01,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would assume maybe those Legos and having a complete collection of that might be... Or excuse me, legally distinct Legos might be alluring to some people.

407
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do have that.

408
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,112
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

409
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:29,847
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

410
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:31,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

411
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were in for it.

412
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bound to happen.

413
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:38,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that it's happening to this group.

414
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:43,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But Playtonic is having to lay off over a dozen staff.

415
00:33:43,652 --> 00:33:46,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We mean, we don't really know how many staff they have.

416
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:49,506
[SPEAKER_04]: They've listed about 50 people on LinkedIn.

417
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:58,856
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those who don't remember, this is the group that did Yooka-Laylee, which is the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie.

418
00:33:58,876 --> 00:34:02,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made by former Rare staff that worked on that game.

419
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:12,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, this is ahead of the release of Yooka-Replaylee.

420
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,992
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually kind of a clever name.

421
00:34:13,972 --> 00:34:40,030
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's I mean we don't really know how big the team is um but the people that are being laid off work in production art design game design narrative design and you uh UX design so UI UX so um I mean they've had issues with with funding you know before I mean that they they

422
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:43,093
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a good track record with games.

423
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:51,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, two, yeah, they launched on Kickstarter pretty much, but we expected quality.

424
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:56,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I don't know what's going to happen, if they're even going to make it through everything.

425
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:22,048
[SPEAKER_04]: that's unfortunate I feel like that Yooka-Laylee did pretty really well you see it everywhere I mean yeah well they had other games yeah of course but maybe that's a sign they were giving it away at some point but still I don't know like Demon Turf, Little Gator Game a few other things but and I mean and they have their past reputation with Rare sure you know but yeah it's sad

426
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:22,617
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

427
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:28,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially on the eve of the Switch 2 where you think would be a console that would lend itself very well to the types of games they're developing.

428
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,909
[SPEAKER_07]: This is very unfortunate.

429
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But look who's been tanking the economy.

430
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:33,916
[SPEAKER_07]: There is that.

431
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:35,659
[SPEAKER_07]: There is that.

432
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

433
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:36,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

434
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

435
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

436
00:35:41,249 --> 00:35:54,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a brand new game, and I keep forgetting about this, probably because it feels like it's so far off, but Mind's Eye, it was by Leslie Benzies, who was the original designer for Grand Theft Auto.

437
00:35:55,214 --> 00:36:05,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he was a lead designer as well for Grand Theft Auto 5, and still has his game coming soon, but also looking to try to...

438
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:09,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Get people to make content for it somehow.

439
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:23,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the studio will support the game through PlayMind's Eye with continuous new content, but also hoping to supplement that with user-made content as well.

440
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:52,971
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully we'll have some some of them will create compelling content and by some I mean a team at Build A Rocket Boy which is selling the game for $60 with a premium pass and stuff like that so they want me to pay for the game and also make content for it yeah I don't know this seems confusing as far as like you know how it's coming out and all that stuff but it does look like you know like a Cyberpunk Grand Theft Auto and those are two things I like so

441
00:36:54,757 --> 00:36:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see how it looks when it comes out.

442
00:36:57,963 --> 00:37:04,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, yeah, I don't like the idea of developers wanting people to make them content for free.

443
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a good game and then people will make content.

444
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, that was LittleBigPlanet's entire gimmick, paid for it to make content for it.

445
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... Well, that's the game.

446
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:17,440
[SPEAKER_05]: You're basically making...

447
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:21,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're making an editor, but, like, is this that type of game?

448
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:25,071
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't made to be, like, a little big planet.

449
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:32,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you could make that same argument with Grand Theft Auto as well because you have, like, the mission editor and, like, the race editor and stuff like that.

450
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:37,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And people coming up with their deep dive roleplay content on Twitch and all that stuff is pretty wild.

451
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:42,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's separate from all of that, but, yeah, it is...

452
00:37:42,817 --> 00:38:05,787
[SPEAKER_05]: it's both of them to ask for people to pay that money and then also make content for them make a good game, people will be happy to make additional content for them if they're excited about it, they're going to make content for it don't just lead with that let it happen a little bit organically

453
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:12,997
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, our next story is something that ought to be completely stinking obvious, but it's not.

454
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:16,280
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe, I don't know, maybe it isn't that obvious, but it seems pretty obvious to me.

455
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:31,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is that the Switch 2 is the cartridges they are saying with the game cards and the game key cards, they're saying, don't get them too close to magnets.

456
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:32,117
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

457
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:32,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

458
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:39,431
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some box art that has been released for Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster.

459
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:52,817
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a little bit of an underlined warning on the back of the box in Japanese, which says a game key card could become unusable if it comes into contact with a strong magnet.

460
00:38:53,388 --> 00:39:05,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth pointing out that warning is not on other game key card boxes, but I just feel like that shouldn't be completely unreasonable of a warming.

461
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,561
[SPEAKER_07]: You also shouldn't lick them.

462
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:10,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking it was common sense, but people don't have that.

463
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, to be fair...

464
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,487
[SPEAKER_07]: You may not realize some magnets that you have.

465
00:39:15,907 --> 00:39:22,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You may not want to put a GameKey card in your wallet if you have some type of magnetic clip on it.

466
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:23,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

467
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:27,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a lot of chargers now are magnetics.

468
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: You might not want to have your GameKey cards sitting out too close to chargers and things like that.

469
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:35,925
[SPEAKER_07]: But you also don't want your bank cards near those things.

470
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:39,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it should be obvious, but maybe not.

471
00:39:39,108 --> 00:39:41,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Allow me to present...

472
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring a lead case with you.

473
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:58,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just thinking, I mean, granted, I think it's engaged by electricity, so I don't know how strong they are outside of that, but the Switch has magnetic Joy-Cons.

474
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:01,495
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of funny.

475
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it, that it's engaged with an electromagnet,

476
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:11,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a magnet in there to get it on there, obviously.

477
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:12,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just always going.

478
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:18,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a relatively strong magnet if it's going to hold the weight of the system up.

479
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of a thing that you probably should have thought about.

480
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:24,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the idea.

481
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:27,028
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura said a lead carrying case, though.

482
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:32,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the idea of a DarkSakura lead Nintendo Switch 2 carrying case.

483
00:40:32,856 --> 00:40:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: It's heavy.

484
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:33,797
Yeah.

485
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And you might get cancer.

486
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:51,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I have a MagSafe pop socket for my phone and it totally demagnetizes those paper tickets that get you in and out of parking garages.

487
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:56,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I take the pop socket off my phone, the magnet there will demagnetize anything.

488
00:40:56,397 --> 00:41:02,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ranmari points out that DarkSakura's lead carrying case may need a Proposition 65 warning.

489
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:04,844
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that you see on the door of like every restaurant.

490
00:41:05,745 --> 00:41:07,767
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's the one thing that doesn't need it.

491
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:10,692
[SPEAKER_05]: May contain lead.

492
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:11,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Does contain lead.

493
00:41:12,254 --> 00:41:13,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It is lead.

494
00:41:13,256 --> 00:41:13,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It is lead.

495
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all lead.

496
00:41:16,381 --> 00:41:16,742
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

497
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:17,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Always has been.

498
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:19,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

499
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to you, Loki, for our next story.

500
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:23,393
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

501
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:29,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So Fortnite finally coming out of the darkness on the App Store or well,

502
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:34,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Off the App Store because it was banned off of the Apple App Store for the longest time.

503
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:39,840
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks to ongoing litigation, it is now back on the App Store.

504
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:44,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can download your Fortnites and play your Fortnites through the App Store.

505
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: You make it sound like Fortnite's been struggling through these dark times.

506
00:41:49,016 --> 00:41:51,521
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been struggling through these dark times.

507
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please.

508
00:41:52,162 --> 00:42:00,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine all of the possible collaborations that they've had to bypass because of all the litigation and money that's gone to it?

509
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even recognize this game anymore.

510
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:07,929
[SPEAKER_07]: All the spinoff games they weren't able to do with Fortnite Festival.

511
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:08,871
[SPEAKER_05]: We could have had...

512
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:19,710
[SPEAKER_05]: We could have had AI Luke and Darth Vader, but no, we had to suffer not having AI Luke and only Darth Vader because of this.

513
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,753
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the recession that we're in.

514
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:26,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope you understand, you know, the trouble we are all going through with this.

515
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sound so old.

516
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:40,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sound very Gen X, boomer, whatever, saying this, but I still don't understand how somebody plays Fortnite, Battle Royale specifically, on a phone in the first place.

517
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of whether it's iPhone or Google, I don't understand

518
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:50,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, especially, like, don't you snipe in that game?

519
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:51,464
[SPEAKER_07]: You have sniper controls and stuff?

520
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:53,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it just seems like it's a pain.

521
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:55,430
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know kids do it.

522
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess some adults do.

523
00:42:56,992 --> 00:43:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've all seen the videos of people sitting at, like, an important function or something, and somebody in the row in front of them is playing Fortnite.

524
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:08,288
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know people can do it, but it's just like, dang.

525
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:13,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I would think something like Fortnite Festival might be easier because you could like tap the screen.

526
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,077
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.

527
00:43:14,497 --> 00:43:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: That I get.

528
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,288
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, yeah, Bobby Blackwell for chat says touch controls are natural for younger players nowadays.

529
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:22,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

530
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:22,730
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wild.

531
00:43:23,411 --> 00:43:28,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your kids play Fortnite on mobile or like iPad or one of those types of things, Loki?

532
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not touch their tablets.

533
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:41,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got them nice tablets one year, and that lasted for about a year, and then they got laptops the next year, and then those tablets have never been used again.

534
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't play Fortnite.

535
00:43:44,976 --> 00:43:47,759
[SPEAKER_05]: They play dumb shit on Roblox.

536
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,943
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still playing... What was it?

537
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Forsaken, which is that... It's like a knockoff...

538
00:43:55,028 --> 00:44:24,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead by Daylight and then they also play I Saw My Son Hanging Out in that Grow a Garden just only because it's popular not because he wants to but because it's memeable right now there's like 11 million players on that thing which is stupid but yeah that trash is they've been playing Forsaken for days now days I'm like why don't you just play the regular Dead by Daylight but no

539
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:27,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

540
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:28,317
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

541
00:44:28,337 --> 00:44:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the killers are like, they're all Roblox lore.

542
00:44:31,445 --> 00:44:34,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like the hackers and stuff like that.

543
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:35,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the...

544
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic, like, noob and stuff is one of the survivors or something.

545
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:41,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

546
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:42,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's weird.

547
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I've seen, because it comes off around my TikTok once in a while.

548
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:52,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen, like, the Roblox, like, Dead by Daylight sort of port, like, with the Huntress and, like, killers that actually exist in Dead by Daylight.

549
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:55,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that they're playing in Roblox, which is wild to me.

550
00:44:55,494 --> 00:45:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also, the one I get most often on TikTok that does, I will admit, it makes me laugh.

551
00:45:01,183 --> 00:45:03,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people that are playing Squid Games.

552
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:18,280
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's some type of like Squid Games port on there and they're just screaming going bananas in those games because, you know, in the new season there's the one where they have to get so many people in a room or they get locked out, that type of thing.

553
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:23,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I get video upon video of people playing that and screaming it.

554
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,648
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the new trailer out for season three.

555
00:45:26,888 --> 00:45:28,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Jump rope's in there.

556
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see that.

557
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch that.

558
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,994
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I got an answer to my earlier question.

559
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:38,559
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the game I saw that started as a PS3 game, the fighting game?

560
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,008
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer is it was called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Stars Battle R. Oh, shit.

561
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:44,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that sounds about right.

562
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,470
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the game.

563
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a JoJo game.

564
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

565
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:49,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That was funny.

566
00:45:50,157 --> 00:45:50,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

567
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,781
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, DarkSakura, we'll go back to you.

568
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:56,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so...

569
00:45:57,237 --> 00:45:59,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it that I'm delivering all the bad news?

570
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the Black Panther game got cancelled.

571
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and thank you EA for being shitty again.

572
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:22,857
[SPEAKER_04]: They have actually ended the studio that's behind it, Cliffhanger Games, that was formed by former Monolith productions leaders.

573
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah the cuts are being instituted quote to sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities I mean um

574
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:49,768
[SPEAKER_07]: If the game was bad and wasn't doing Black Panther justice... Yes, this news is frustrating because we... You didn't say anything about that.

575
00:46:49,968 --> 00:46:50,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, I know.

576
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,533
[SPEAKER_07]: But we get layoff story after layoff story after layoff story, right?

577
00:46:54,114 --> 00:47:01,804
[SPEAKER_07]: But if the game was on track to be a Suicide Squad type of arrival type of game...

578
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:29,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand why EA games get cancelled sometimes sometimes it's quality, sometimes it's market demand but I don't think it's that I think people would have ate the fuck up out of a Black Panther game so I'm left to believe in the lack of any specifics because everything in this industry is so goddamn secretive I'm left to infer, believe that the game must not have been up to a certain level of quality and again, this was these screenshots look amazing

579
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:45,375
[SPEAKER_07]: it was almost certainly not the fault of the developers on the front line but probably some type of monetization direction they were trying to go with in the game and you know how that always gets things fucky especially at EA so you know it's a bummer

580
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually looks like there was some concept art and some... Looks like some other stuff from within the game that make it look really gorgeous.

581
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:09,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And that it was... You were going to be playing as T'Challa's son and you were going against Skrulls.

582
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:13,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And, I mean, it honestly looks...

583
00:48:16,118 --> 00:48:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

584
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:39,681
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

585
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:59,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's talk about another feature of the Switch 2.

586
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:18,913
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

587
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:23,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Just needing that little extra power to do a very simple graphic filter melted the Switch 1.

588
00:49:23,762 --> 00:49:26,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but it's something that's only going to be available on Switch 2.

589
00:49:26,687 --> 00:49:33,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can also view and change controls, meaning remap all of the buttons, which ought to be fucking standard for anything, but okay.

590
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:35,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that, no, I'm sorry.

591
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:40,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I correct myself, that feature will also be on original Switch when it rolls out.

592
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to pull it back a little bit.

593
00:49:42,476 --> 00:49:46,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So at least there will be the remapping ability on Switch and Switch 2.

594
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:50,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is all coming with the release of the Switch 2 on June 5th.

595
00:49:50,409 --> 00:49:52,292
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to wait any longer for that.

596
00:49:52,272 --> 00:50:10,888
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think I think it's funny I think there are a lot of people that like one of the first things they're going to play on their Switch 2 is like F-Zero GX and like the classics and stuff because again I can't wait for multiplayer on that stuff it's gonna be fun all right well speaking of classic stuff let's go to our bumper for the next segment

597
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:29,921
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

598
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:33,231
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

599
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:43,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, but once a month, DarkSakura flips the script a little bit and says, you know what, we're going to do a game that is a console to arcade.

600
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It originally was on consoles, but went to the arcade.

601
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:51,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And I never even realized this company ever made any arcade games ever.

602
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,502
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's hear more about this.

603
00:50:53,782 --> 00:51:03,641
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so first of all, the game in question came out in 1994 in the arcade from a console game, and it is Battletoads Arcade.

604
00:51:04,623 --> 00:51:11,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So it had also been known as Super Battletoads or just Battletoads, but it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up arcade game.

605
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:15,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It was developed by Rare and published by EA.

606
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:22,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It is up to three players, and you go through six levels to save the universe from the Dark Queen.

607
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:32,175
[SPEAKER_04]: You have vertical levels, bonus levels, everyone has their own attack, and they've also got some fourth wall breaking funds.

608
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I said funds.

609
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:34,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun stuff.

610
00:51:35,022 --> 00:51:39,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Rare went a little bit more with the violence on this one.

611
00:51:39,994 --> 00:51:47,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their first game to use 3D graphics that was later implemented in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct.

612
00:51:47,512 --> 00:52:06,740
[SPEAKER_04]: The gameplay tested pretty well and seemed viable but there was some hesitation behind releasing it and it ended up being unsuccessful and so Rare cancelled any ports that they had including a completely finished and tested Game Boy version.

613
00:52:08,682 --> 00:52:16,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, actually this game was the reason that there had been no more Battletoads until 2020.

614
00:52:16,013 --> 00:52:32,875
[SPEAKER_04]: it has since been released on console when it was emulated for Rare Replay it came out in 2015 a compilation of Rare games on Xbox One and people were like

615
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Really surprised at just how high quality the arcade release was and thought it was one of the best ones.

616
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:43,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really good quality game.

617
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:44,229
[SPEAKER_04]: The highlight of the series, they said.

618
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Of that package, sorry.

619
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

620
00:52:49,477 --> 00:53:07,266
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you have the usual Battletoads stuff, you eat flies to regenerate health you beat stuff up, you know and each level has a unique name, like you have Christmas Grotto and some of the bosses from earlier games come back, like General Slaughter and

621
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:27,060
[SPEAKER_04]: but it seemed that Rare developed it directly it was published by EA in 1994 it's the fifth Battletoads game they were really trying to follow the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game

622
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:53,402
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were also experimenting with 3D graphics that were using an application called Power Animator which later on became Autodesk Maya which I took some college classes in and it was their first rare game that used this and of course as I said earlier it was later implemented in Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country the game

623
00:53:54,344 --> 00:54:10,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

624
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: so for the rare replay version that I mentioned earlier they did put in the setting for Unlimited Continues a rewind and replay and a save game progress at any time but they said it bombed badly they said the sales were mediocre and the arcade release rode on the success of the console games and just did not do it um

625
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:59,080
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was though given a 4 out of 5 stars by some reviewers even comparing it to Turtles in Time and Simpsons Arcade and has been since considered while relatively obscure it's the best in the series and an absolute swan of a rare game

626
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:11,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It was put on par with the games from Konami and Sega and said it was humorous and funny and that it was absolutely a blast to play.

627
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:14,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So why it didn't do better?

628
00:55:14,697 --> 00:55:15,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

629
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's why you don't hesitate!

630
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as its legacy like I said the franchise did go on hiatus after this game and the re-release was 26 years later with a 2020 series reboot and then Rare considered doing a possible sequel in the mid 2000s but they really didn't want to make a failure like at the time the TMNT reboot had been

631
00:55:48,318 --> 00:56:08,065
[SPEAKER_04]: so but their expectations were low but people wanted it and so the newer ones caught on and this one sort of fell into obscurity until that compilation release so there you go, Battletoads Arcade

632
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:10,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great pick.

633
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:14,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of with some folks in chat who this was just not on their radar.

634
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost embarrassed to say it, but I never realized they did an arcade version of this game.

635
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,895
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, never played the arcade version.

636
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume it has those difficult stages later on.

637
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:26,728
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that would be one way to get your quarters, wouldn't it?

638
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:34,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should say that this was not really a port from any of the home versions, but it was a home franchise that came out in the arcade.

639
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:39,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, yeah, it looks way better than the home versions, to be quite honest.

640
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, it looks great.

641
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:46,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And they used, like, you know, they were using early...

642
00:56:46,402 --> 00:57:08,697
[SPEAKER_07]: 3D in these games yeah I always love that in the Battletoads games where like the giant like fist or the giant like shoe that comes out and kicks people I always thought that was such a neat piece of flair in the Battletoads games but yeah you know and I when I originally had brought up your long play of this and saw the Electronic Arts logo I was like

643
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:11,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they ever have arcade games?

644
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually was corrected in chat.

645
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:16,484
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya said EA had a few arcade games.

646
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,665
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a Madden game.

647
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I should have assumed that was a thing at some point.

648
00:57:19,948 --> 00:57:22,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And a couple of the Need for Speed games.

649
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, of course, those.

650
00:57:23,431 --> 00:57:25,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I did neglect those.

651
00:57:25,713 --> 00:57:27,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Got arcade ports randomly.

652
00:57:27,174 --> 00:57:30,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, it's not often you see the Electronic Arts logo on an arcade game.

653
00:57:30,598 --> 00:57:33,580
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very special sort of release, I think.

654
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

655
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:36,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat pick.

656
00:57:36,606 --> 00:57:37,067
[SPEAKER_07]: There it is.

657
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:41,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Battletoads, your classic console to arcade game of the month.

658
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:43,099
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

659
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:48,630
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, let's move into some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines real quick.

660
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:50,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we'll go to you first.

661
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:55,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some more details regarding the Switch game compatibility with the Switch 2.

662
00:57:56,534 --> 00:57:59,899
[SPEAKER_05]: We had kind of a long list of games that weren't supported initially.

663
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:10,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, at least of first-party games, that has been whittled down to quite a few games that are not compatible.

664
00:58:11,975 --> 00:58:15,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Only like five we have, so not too bad.

665
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the most obvious, Nintendo Labo VR.

666
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:24,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not going to work because the headset is just completely a different size.

667
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes perfect sense.

668
00:58:26,495 --> 00:58:31,100
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can still do Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 1, 2, and 3.

669
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to use that with the original Switch Joy-Cons instead because of the IR stuff and all that.

670
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:49,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Other games that are not compatible, their first party, Nico Nico, Abma, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Inkypen.

671
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:53,412
[SPEAKER_05]: are the five apps or whatever that are not compatible.

672
00:58:53,933 --> 00:59:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Other games that also require the Switch 1 Joy-Cons, Rig Fit Adventure, 1-2 Switch, Everybody 1-2 Switch.

673
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:05,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do yourself a favor and don't get those.

674
00:59:06,036 --> 00:59:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Builder Garage, Nintendo Switch Sports, WarioWare Move It, and then, of course, Nintendo Labo.

675
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I can definitely guess by WarioWare Move It, Switch Sports, and I'm guessing the other ones, it's all because of that IR sensor.

676
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:22,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you need the other ones.

677
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:28,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Third party, there's a lot more stuff outside of that, but that's at least what you have for first party stuff.

678
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:29,063
Okay.

679
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:47,760
[SPEAKER_07]: uh yeah Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out to be fair with many of these it's just certain features so yeah like certain yeah mini games in WarioWare are not going to work and things like that but it's important to know before you get into it especially when we talk about a very big backwards compatible library it's not all encompassing so uh DarkSakura

680
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:52,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, there's going to be more Death Stranding stuff.

681
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Kojima revealed that there is an anime in the works.

682
00:59:58,885 --> 01:00:05,774
[SPEAKER_04]: He just put it out, says, I'm currently working with A24 on a live-action film adaptation, he said.

683
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next quote is this, when it comes to adapting games into visual media, there are works like The Last of Us, which stay true to the original storyline, and films like the Super Mario Bros.

684
01:00:14,265 --> 01:00:16,268
[SPEAKER_04]: movie, which is more of a service to fans of the game.

685
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:17,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to keep reading.

686
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:44,460
[SPEAKER_04]: all these works have their own merits as a film enthusiast I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema I aim to create a Death Stranding that can be realized through film one could win awards at films like the Cannes Festival or Venice Festival in fact we are also currently working on an anime adaptation he's really ambitious for this he really really wants this to be a thing but you know the first game did pretty well yeah so yeah

687
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:48,225
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, I have some news on the Evercade front.

688
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:51,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'm a casual fan of the Evercade stuff.

689
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:52,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I like collecting them.

690
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one behind me.

691
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:53,753
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little hard to see.

692
01:00:53,773 --> 01:00:54,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes we're broadcasting live.

693
01:00:55,295 --> 01:00:59,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have one of these little smaller cabinets.

694
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I guess, a bar top arcade is what they call it, an alpha machine.

695
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:10,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have one that's Capcom, specifically Mega Man branded, and there's also a Street Fighter one that has games baked into the machine.

696
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:13,517
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not on cartridge, but they're games baked into the machine.

697
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:17,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably that's the only way they can get the license rights or whatever for it.

698
01:01:17,322 --> 01:01:25,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it turns out Taito is going to be teaming up with Evercade, and there's going to be a Taito-themed Bartop Arcade coming that is going to be Bubble Bobble-themed.

699
01:01:25,912 --> 01:01:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess by default, but the little light box above...

700
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:36,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They send you little sheets, little plastic sheets for all the games in the collection.

701
01:01:36,645 --> 01:01:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could make this a Strider cabinet if I wanted to because they gave me a sheet for that and all the games that are in it.

702
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:48,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would assume the title will have multiple besides just Bubble Bobble, but I don't want to assume either.

703
01:01:48,762 --> 01:02:00,379
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do know the games that will be in the bar top will be Bubble Bobble, Kadash, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Growl, The Legend of Kage, The New Zealand Story, Puzzle Bobble, Rastan.

704
01:02:00,399 --> 01:02:01,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I love New Zealand Story.

705
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,202
[SPEAKER_07]: and Space Invaders.

706
01:02:03,222 --> 01:02:10,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what's also interesting is that if you, I mentioned that it was probably due to rights that they're baked in.

707
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:14,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, they will be doing separate Taito cartridges.

708
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:18,996
[SPEAKER_07]: So the bar top arcade is pre-ordered on May 30th.

709
01:02:19,357 --> 01:02:20,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So it already happened.

710
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:23,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It will go for either 200 euros.

711
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, 200 pounds, 220 euros or $250.

712
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

713
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder why the dollars are more this time.

714
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:33,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't usually see that.

715
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:34,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

716
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:36,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder what happened.

717
01:02:36,158 --> 01:02:36,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

718
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:37,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

719
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Trump.

720
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:38,702
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

721
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,784
[SPEAKER_07]: But it will be launching in November.

722
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:43,828
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to get the cartridges separately, you can.

723
01:02:43,848 --> 01:02:46,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get separate cartridges and you would actually get more games.

724
01:02:47,112 --> 01:02:48,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Taito Arcade 1.

725
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:51,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I want both of these cartridges, especially when I tell you the lineup.

726
01:02:51,718 --> 01:02:57,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Taito Arcade 1, Bubble Bobble, Chack and Pop, Colony 7, Dandoko Dawn,

727
01:02:57,145 --> 01:03:03,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Growl, Space Invaders, Pirate Pete, Ranma S, and The Legend of Kage.

728
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:15,938
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Arcade 2 has Alpine Ski, The Electric Yo-Yo, Elevator Action, Kiki Kaikai, Liquid Kids, Rastan, Operation Wolf, The New Zealand Story, and Volfied.

729
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That second one sounds better because Kiki Kaikai, I mean, that was Haki and Raki.

730
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:31,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, so that's coming September, and those cartridges will cost you 20 euros, I'm sorry, 20 pounds, 25 euros, or $30.

731
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:40,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, now we feel the pain of the dollars being more than the others because of who we elected.

732
01:03:41,729 --> 01:04:06,471
[SPEAKER_07]: by the way I have more actually this is turning not so rapid but uh there's just a lot of Evercade news this week we know more Neo Geo cartridges are coming we already heard about Neo Geo Arcade 1 but we also announced uh this week in October Neo Geo Arcade 2 with Artifighting 2, Crossed Swords, Garou Mark of the Wolves, Metal Slug 2, Ninja Commando, and Sengoku 2

[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

735
01:04:19,136 --> 01:04:20,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Twinkle Star Sprites.

736

[SPEAKER_07]: All coming out.

737
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:27,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And those will be again, 20 pounds, 25 euros, $30.

[SPEAKER_07]: or DarkSakura.com.

739
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:46,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile... Maybe the world will burn.

740
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:48,057
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

741
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:56,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's move on to world release dates and check out what else is coming out a little sooner than those Evercade cartridges.

742
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,605
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, busy week, right, Loki?

743

[SPEAKER_07]: There's...

744
01:04:59,287 --> 01:05:00,950
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new console coming.

745
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,072
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a lot.

746

769
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:49,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to just say ditto for the Switch 2 releases for Japan because it's a very similar list worldwide and let's be real, I'm not going to read through that entire list of releases.

770
01:07:49,824 --> 01:07:50,686
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot.

771
01:07:50,786 --> 01:07:54,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just going to say ditto on Japan and UK, I guess.

772
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:56,198
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will just peak quickly.

773
01:07:56,278 --> 01:07:56,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to

774
01:07:56,879 --> 01:08:13,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at PlayStation 5 in Japan.

775
01:08:13,045 --> 01:08:14,647
[SPEAKER_07]: also on June 5th.

776
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:16,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may be of interest to you.

777
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:22,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Saga Frontier 2 Remastered also gets a physical release in Japan on the PlayStation 5.

779
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:32,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So otherwise, I'm just going to say ditto on the Switch 2 launch.

780
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, anything you want to clarify with UK outside of Switch 2?

781
01:08:37,331 --> 01:08:39,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe I answered that question already.

782
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:39,894
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

783
01:08:41,816 --> 01:08:42,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's nothing.

784
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:45,010
[SPEAKER_07]: All the same!

785
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:47,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, wait.

786
01:08:47,513 --> 01:08:48,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait.

787
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:49,575
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one thing.

788
01:08:49,595 --> 01:08:54,740
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Tour de France 2025 on June 5th.

789
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pro Cycling Manager.

790
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:01,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get to spin the sticks so hard you break your thumb on those games?

791
01:09:02,248 --> 01:09:03,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, no, I take that back.

792
01:09:04,751 --> 01:09:05,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

793
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:08,595
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an early access for Dune Awakening for PC.

794
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:09,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Cute.

795
01:09:10,257 --> 01:09:10,457
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

796
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:15,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, just a couple more stories and we'll get to the listener roundtable.

797
01:09:15,413 --> 01:09:16,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have an email or two.

798
01:09:17,798 --> 01:09:18,218
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one.

799
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:23,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, one email and then we'll get to any of your questions in chat or otherwise.

800
01:09:23,849 --> 01:09:25,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get to Loki.

801
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:33,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know how Nintendo has their news app that they put out?

802
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:37,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're trying to prevent people from sharing the news from the news app.

803
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:43,569
[SPEAKER_05]: They will actually black out the screen with the data, so preventing you from sharing the stuff.

804
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:47,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are ways around that.

805
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:50,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And why wouldn't they want you to share the news?

806
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:53,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have to go to the app, I guess.

807
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's the paywall.

808
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:55,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Silly.

809
01:09:55,428 --> 01:09:55,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It's silly.

810
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,591
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking stupid.

811
01:09:57,692 --> 01:10:00,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand that people need to get paid.

812
01:10:00,476 --> 01:10:00,576
Yeah.

813
01:10:02,564 --> 01:10:28,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand people need to get paid, but...

814
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:29,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Windows or whatever.

815
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:31,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dumb.

816
01:10:31,499 --> 01:10:39,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a dumb hurdle to get through for the casual person that's excited about your games and wants to share their excitement with other people.

817
01:10:40,517 --> 01:10:42,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't have that.

818
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:44,427
[SPEAKER_05]: God forbid, lock it all down.

819
01:10:44,668 --> 01:10:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's just an example, again, about this industry isn't transparent enough sometimes.

820
01:10:50,274 --> 01:10:52,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gets extraordinarily frustrating.

821
01:10:52,136 --> 01:11:00,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand the reason for some secrecy, but like the lack of transparency on some of the decisions that are made is just, you know, fine, you leave it to us to make up.

822
01:11:01,085 --> 01:11:04,829
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're not transparent, you let us fill in the gaps and we're going to just say you're ignorant.

823
01:11:04,849 --> 01:11:07,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where we land with this particular headline.

824
01:11:07,632 --> 01:11:08,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is...

825
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:12,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be great to have more insight, but we're never going to get it.

826
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:13,307
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

827
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:19,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to sort of remind people here at the end, Summer Game Fest is next week.

828
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:32,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have a lot of stuff that's coming that's not just that main event that's happening on Friday at 2 Pacific, 5 Eastern from the Keelyverse, which, by the way, we are going to co-stream here on VOG Network.

829
01:11:32,795 --> 01:12:02,751
[SPEAKER_07]: usually I can't do these types of things because they're during the day for me but I'm doing some different things at work and I'm going to be working a new schedule where I'm actually going to have Friday off so by a nice coincidence I am able to do this co-stream with Bobby Blackwolf so we're actually going to be watching the Summer Game Fest Keeley information I'm expecting it's probably going to be like four hours it's probably something ridiculously long but that is you know something to look forward to but that's not all there are a lot of other

830
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:05,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Showcase is coming.

831
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:10,181
[SPEAKER_07]: June 7th at 1pm, we have Green Games Showcase.

832
01:12:11,142 --> 01:12:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Shining a light on environmental issues and how to contribute to real world causes.

833
01:12:15,408 --> 01:12:19,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a little bit of PSA type information for the gaming industry.

834
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:26,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious if maybe it'll get into anything about how to make the games industry more green, but we'll see.

835
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have Frosty Games Fest.

836
01:12:29,676 --> 01:12:35,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the joke is it is currently winter in Australia and New Zealand.

837
01:12:35,463 --> 01:12:43,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have Frosty Game Fest that's going to be focusing on Australia and New Zealand types of games and things that have been built in those areas.

838
01:12:43,432 --> 01:12:46,276
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be on June 8th at 9 a.m.

839
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:47,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Australian.

840
01:12:47,477 --> 01:12:49,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Australian Eastern Standard Time.

841
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Sydney's time zone.

842
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So AEST.

843
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:53,004
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 11 a.m.

844
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:54,085
[SPEAKER_07]: New Zealand.

845
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:56,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the Xbox Games Showcase.

846
01:12:57,089 --> 01:12:59,992
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be Sunday, June 8th.

847
01:13:00,012 --> 01:13:01,614
[SPEAKER_07]: So the morning before our next show.

848
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:02,455
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a 10 a.m.

849
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Pacific though, so that's nice and early.

850
01:13:04,157 --> 01:13:08,783
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course they want the worldwide views because that's more the evening time in Europe when that is going to air.

851
01:13:09,624 --> 01:13:14,930
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the Southeast Asian Games Showcase is also happening.

852
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't currently see the date and time on that.

853
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's June 7th.

854
01:13:19,816 --> 01:13:24,307
[SPEAKER_07]: at, what time?

855
01:13:24,387 --> 01:13:25,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a time on that.

856
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:26,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I found it, 3 p.m.

857
01:13:26,613 --> 01:13:27,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern.

858
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:28,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all on a YouTube live stream for that.

859
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,934
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the Latin American Games Showcase, June 7th at 11 a.m.

860
01:13:34,954 --> 01:13:37,420
[SPEAKER_07]: 50 indie games in that one.

861
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,505
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Women-Led Games Showcase coming back for its second year.

862
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:45,127
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be June 7th at 10 a.m.

863
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:49,532
[SPEAKER_07]: on Twitch and YouTube, also through IGN and GameSpot.

864
01:13:49,912 --> 01:13:50,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So you check that out.

865
01:13:51,013 --> 01:14:01,283
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, that same team is also doing a Steam sale that is going to start June 6th and run through the 13th, also to support Women-Led Games.

866
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:03,285
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots and lots.

867
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:05,567
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have a Devolver Direct event

868
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:08,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Loki loves his Devolver Directs and many of you do.

869
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:09,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be there.

870
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:10,613
[SPEAKER_05]: They get weird.

871
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:12,234
[SPEAKER_07]: June 6th at 8.

872
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:18,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing is ever going to be the year that they put out a playable game that was like E3 Walking Simulator.

873
01:14:18,101 --> 01:14:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It was great.

874
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:20,384
[SPEAKER_07]: June 6th at 8 p.m.

875
01:14:20,404 --> 01:14:31,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Eastern for that Day of the Devs will also be indie games, of course, will be happening June 6th.

876
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:34,445
[SPEAKER_07]: 7pm Eastern for that.

877
01:14:35,288 --> 01:14:36,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Busy, busy, busy.

878
01:14:36,391 --> 01:14:38,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I hit all the big ones that I know of.

879
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get a surprise Nintendo Direct maybe?

880
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:43,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't hold your breath.

881
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:52,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like because the system's coming out, you might get one announcement or two to remind people it's out, but I don't know.

882
01:14:52,772 --> 01:15:00,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost worry a Nintendo Direct would be bad news because it could be a price increase because of everything going on now that the pre-orders have been filled.

883
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:02,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

884
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:21,204
[SPEAKER_07]: and don't count anything out I suppose but um yeah there'd be a lot of other noise going on right now I feel like if Nintendo just kind of waits a week they could really take the narrative next week you know what I mean so we'll see uh one more direct uh sorry a wholesome direct June 7th at 12 p.m.

885
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:25,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they've had these uh games before these are your cozy games

886
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:48,724
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

887
01:15:48,704 --> 01:15:49,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

888
01:15:49,947 --> 01:15:52,772
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, it's not just the big Keeley event.

889
01:15:52,792 --> 01:15:55,237
[SPEAKER_07]: There are all of these indie things happening.

890
01:15:56,199 --> 01:16:00,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, maybe more like, you know, not quite AAA studios, but, you know, the next tier.

891
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:04,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Also making announcements through these things.

892
01:16:04,296 --> 01:16:05,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's big.

893
01:16:05,638 --> 01:16:08,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tootsie is saying Nintendo will be at Summer Game Fest.

894
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:09,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean...

895
01:16:10,523 --> 01:16:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Why wouldn't they want to remind people the Switch 2 is out?

896
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:18,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe there could be a little stealth drop they do.

897
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:22,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe an update to the classic game library or something.

898
01:16:22,074 --> 01:16:25,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's your Pokemon idea that came up earlier in the show.

899
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:27,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I think that would get saved for the Pokemon Direct.

900
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:28,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But you never know.

901
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:34,366
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be just something a little... We're going to give away that Nintendo Tour for free.

902
01:16:34,526 --> 01:16:35,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Haha, just kidding.

903
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:36,328
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to do that.

904
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:39,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get to the listener roundtable.

905
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week we encourage your emails.

906
01:16:41,405 --> 01:16:44,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeOnRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

907
01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:48,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll go to DarkSakura for the reading of the email.

908
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,035
[SPEAKER_04]: The reading of the email.

909
01:16:52,397 --> 01:16:54,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi.

910
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say thanks for the well wishes.

911
01:16:56,602 --> 01:16:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing better.

912
01:16:57,162 --> 01:16:58,844
[SPEAKER_04]: First night back from the hospital.

913
01:16:59,044 --> 01:17:00,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, enough about that.

914
01:17:00,806 --> 01:17:04,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I am really enjoying this team deck a lot more than I thought I would.

915
01:17:05,271 --> 01:17:08,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask and I'll do my best to answer.

916
01:17:08,675 --> 01:17:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say thanks for the show.

917
01:17:10,337 --> 01:17:12,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And as always, I look forward to the show every Sunday.

918
01:17:12,819 --> 01:17:14,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay awesome and game on.

919
01:17:14,681 --> 01:17:16,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Sincerely yours, Mishi.

920
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:21,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Mishi had a little bit of medical ups and downs this week that I saw on Blue Sky.

921
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,879
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really glad you're in chat.

922
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,182
[SPEAKER_07]: You're with us tonight and chatting away.

923
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:28,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that means you're feeling good enough to be here.

924
01:17:29,006 --> 01:17:31,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate seeing you and having your presence here tonight.

925
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And congratulations on the Steam Deck.

926
01:17:34,093 --> 01:17:35,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any questions because I also have one.

927
01:17:35,975 --> 01:17:39,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my question is, have you tried the adventure of sideloading emulators yet?

928
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:42,285
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need some tips, I'll help.

929
01:17:43,447 --> 01:17:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some things that make it easier, but you're going to want to read the instructions unlike what I did because I got lost.

930
01:17:51,438 --> 01:17:51,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know why?

931
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:53,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you need to read the fucking instructions.

932
01:17:54,423 --> 01:17:55,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't do that.

933
01:17:55,344 --> 01:17:56,165
[SPEAKER_07]: So I own it.

934
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:58,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I own it.

935
01:17:58,108 --> 01:17:59,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

936
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:04,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Mish says is in chat and says, I would have found a way to watch the show for the emergency room.

937
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that, but please take care of your health first.

938
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:11,022
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why this is a podcast.

939
01:18:11,042 --> 01:18:13,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really okay if you're not here live.

940
01:18:13,609 --> 01:18:18,823
[SPEAKER_07]: There's many people that have never been here live that have been listening to this show for a very long time.

941
01:18:18,843 --> 01:18:20,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So we appreciate all of them as well.

942
01:18:20,748 --> 01:18:22,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, thank you.

943
01:18:22,773 --> 01:18:23,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well thanks for the email.

944
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:28,858
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to send us an email in a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send the email.

945
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, at this part of the show, enjoy taking your calls in our green room at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.

946
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:41,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would encourage you to join our Discord and talk with us throughout the week over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.

947
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:52,138
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of stories and a lot of the insight I kind of get on how y'all are feeling about it is because I read our Orange Lounge Radio channel and our general channel and the other stuff on the Discord channel throughout the week.

948
01:18:52,118 --> 01:18:59,568
[SPEAKER_07]: The admins have a no ping philosophy on Discord because we know so many Discords ping you every five minutes.

949
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:00,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've made a decision.

950
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:01,331
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't ping.

951
01:19:01,712 --> 01:19:05,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a channel if you want to see all the pingable announcements.

952
01:19:05,256 --> 01:19:07,960
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an announcements channel when new shows and things drop.

953
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:11,325
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will let you choose when you want to look at that.

954
01:19:11,305 --> 01:19:14,208
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, yeah, so if you're worried about that, just join.

955
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:17,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Come join the party with us on Discord, vognetwork.com.

956
01:19:18,312 --> 01:19:21,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can take your calls like we're going to do right now.

957
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:23,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure this person wanted to call in last week.

958
01:19:23,538 --> 01:19:25,300
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to talk to this person tonight.

959
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go to the telephone lines, the modern ones, and say hello.

960
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:30,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

961
01:19:30,405 --> 01:19:30,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

962
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's the Ranma.

963
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Ranma, good to see you.

964
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

965
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:41,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, how about y'all?

966
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:42,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, welcome back.

967
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize your shirt.

968
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:47,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a shirt from Super Nintendo World, isn't it?

969
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:48,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

970
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: In the extra large, I just put it on a minute ago.

971
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, it's a lot roomier than I thought it would be.

972
01:19:56,302 --> 01:19:58,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a different design.

973
01:19:58,786 --> 01:20:08,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So to describe for our podcast listeners, he's wearing a green Luigi t-shirt, and it has, I'm assuming, Luigi written in Japanese below that.

974
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:15,670
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's mostly green, but imagine more of a tank top sports shirt type of fit, but then the extended sleeves are blue.

975
01:20:15,886 --> 01:20:33,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think is interesting I know, I know, but the extended sleeves are blue The green is in that shape of a sports shirt I know, I just love the way that looks It looks like one of the VOG Network shirts we used to have That I really liked And there's also a Mario version too, which is really cool Yeah, and I have the Bowser hat I have a Bowser hat around here Actually, wait, I think it's right over here

976
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:35,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the funny thing.

977
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:40,094
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I bought my Bowser hat from when I was there, yeah.

978
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:42,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interesting thing.

979
01:20:42,498 --> 01:20:46,124
[SPEAKER_02]: The hat that I'm wearing, it is a Luigi bucket hat.

980
01:20:46,144 --> 01:20:51,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this hat at a convention earlier this year, and I said, this is going to be my Japan hat.

981
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:59,264
[SPEAKER_02]: For two straight weeks, I had people on the street just point and go, Luigi or Mario.

982
01:20:59,524 --> 01:21:04,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had tourists just come by and say the hat is awesome and give me high fives.

983
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:08,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in random people's selfies with this hat.

984
01:21:08,678 --> 01:21:11,642
[SPEAKER_02]: People thought I got it from Universal, but I didn't.

985
01:21:11,662 --> 01:21:17,230
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go to Universal, they have a reversible bucket hat for Mario and Luigi.

986
01:21:17,817 --> 01:21:18,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

987
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:19,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

988
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so funny that you ended up in selfies and stuff, too.

989
01:21:21,923 --> 01:21:22,504
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so cool.

990
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:31,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, I have a group of friends from online and some of the games I used to play that I'm following the Instagram stories of their adventures in Japan.

991
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:32,039
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like they're having such fun.

992
01:21:32,419 --> 01:21:35,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them said, we just got interviewed by a third grade class.

993
01:21:36,686 --> 01:21:40,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess people will really just walk right up to you.

994
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:47,157
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people at Narita and Haneda that will just interview tourists that are coming in.

995
01:21:47,317 --> 01:21:47,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

996
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:48,602
[SPEAKER_02]: That's neat.

997
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:52,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So, how is Japan?

998
01:21:53,002 --> 01:22:14,655
[SPEAKER_02]: was great now here's the thing I really wanted to call in while I was running around Osaka and Akihabara we just figured you were asleep the gaming stores but here's the thing 99% of the gaming stores open around 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning which is around the time you guys sign off sure

999
01:22:15,918 --> 01:22:20,185
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we figured, and I, you know, last week I was like, well, Ranma said he wanted to call in, but you know what?

1000
01:22:20,205 --> 01:22:24,112
[SPEAKER_07]: He's probably having fun and has better things to do than talk to us right now.

1001
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:24,974
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll hear from him later.

1002
01:22:25,014 --> 01:22:26,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So I figured you wouldn't call in.

1003
01:22:26,556 --> 01:22:26,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1004
01:22:27,839 --> 01:22:28,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Bull and shit.

1005
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on now.

1006
01:22:29,602 --> 01:22:38,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you, the first week there, my entire sleep schedule was thrown off by a few hours, which I was perfectly okay with because I woke up around...

1007
01:22:39,374 --> 01:22:45,715
[SPEAKER_02]: between 5 and 6, showered, relaxed, went to the Denny's across the street and had a damn good breakfast.

1008
01:22:45,996 --> 01:22:46,819
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I did.

1009
01:22:48,571 --> 01:22:49,051
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

1010
01:22:49,192 --> 01:22:50,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to go to Japan.

1011
01:22:51,994 --> 01:22:57,479
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've been saying this for a long time, but like the closer I get to 50, the more I'm like, I just need to fucking go.

1012
01:22:57,499 --> 01:23:06,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's, I don't know if it's going to happen next year because Alan and I are still trying to plan a Europe cruise, but maybe the year, maybe for my 50th birthday, who fucking knows.

1013
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:09,110
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would just, I would really just love to go, to be honest.

1014
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:09,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be so fun.

1015
01:23:10,872 --> 01:23:11,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.

1016
01:23:11,372 --> 01:23:15,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do not go between May and September.

1017
01:23:15,696 --> 01:23:16,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1018
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,482
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is sweltering hot.

1019
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I discovered that the hard way and thanks to one of my friends, I had to stop into Don Quixote and pick up these deodorant body wipes called Gatsby.

1020
01:23:28,674 --> 01:23:33,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Gatsby also makes the hair products I use, the moving rubber.

1021
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, yes.

1022
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: These are a godsend.

1023
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:41,730
[SPEAKER_04]: They also sell those at Oto's in town.

1024
01:23:43,162 --> 01:23:49,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you're probably going to do more of a full recap on your show, Anime Jam Session, on Tuesday.

1025
01:23:49,051 --> 01:23:52,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But what were some of the highlights of your trip, especially gaming-related things?

1026
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:53,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Nintendo World.

1027
01:23:53,939 --> 01:23:55,160
[SPEAKER_07]: How was Nintendo World in Japan?

1028
01:23:57,324 --> 01:24:07,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw the photo of you trying to get into the cart, and unfortunately, too bad, puffy American boy, no ride for you.

1029
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have fun because I was mostly there more for the ambience and the environment.

1030
01:24:15,534 --> 01:24:16,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

1031
01:24:16,375 --> 01:24:18,299
[SPEAKER_07]: You really didn't miss the ride.

1032
01:24:18,579 --> 01:24:19,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1033
01:24:20,282 --> 01:24:23,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool, but you'll be okay, Ranma.

1034
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:24,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1035
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:25,450
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1036
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends, she actually got me a personalized power band, so it was my name and Katakana on it, so that's cool.

1037
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:33,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I love that.

1038
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:33,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1039
01:24:34,044 --> 01:24:34,144
Okay.

1040
01:24:34,664 --> 01:25:03,523
[SPEAKER_02]: so I did try to do the whole three keys thing but we ran out of time for a small area Super Nintendo World is there are some pretty long lines and stuff so I did do one ride there I did the Detective Conan 4D Theater Adventure which was kind of fun I would have never thought all the different rides different movies over there well if you're into Jaws there's still the Jaws theme area that's still there nice

1041
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:31,232
[SPEAKER_02]: we're gonna need a bigger boat but um I did get some gaming stuff, not a lot I was trying to track down a couple of video games but a couple of the super potatoes I went to didn't have them but I will say this you will find tons of retro consoles floating around if you're looking to save a few dollars if you don't want a Japanese console I can take that

1042
01:25:31,938 --> 01:25:40,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I did stop by the Capcom Cafe and Mako-chan asked for a special request of something.

1043
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:43,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I assume we've all played Resident Evil, right?

1044
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,035
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point in our life, yeah.

1045
01:25:45,776 --> 01:25:50,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know how the herbs will give you, restore your energy and abilities and so forth?

1046
01:25:53,186 --> 01:25:58,272
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the herbs as teas?

1047
01:25:58,292 --> 01:25:59,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a cute idea.

1048
01:25:59,354 --> 01:25:59,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1049
01:26:00,136 --> 01:26:00,917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cute idea.

1050
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1051
01:26:01,418 --> 01:26:04,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Green, blue, red, and lemon.

1052
01:26:04,684 --> 01:26:05,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yellow.

1053
01:26:05,265 --> 01:26:07,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked these up for her.

1054
01:26:07,508 --> 01:26:10,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can have literally herbal tea.

1055
01:26:11,014 --> 01:26:11,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1056
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I went and picked up a couple of some albums.

1057
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I would have to say I have seen the Super Mario Brothers movie at least five times.

1058
01:26:24,257 --> 01:26:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in theaters.

1059
01:26:26,326 --> 01:26:55,489
[SPEAKER_02]: three times streaming and once on Blu-ray I actually have a CD version and all the limited edition Blu-rays that each retailer was putting out because that's how much I loved it so I feel you on the whole Mass Effect 3 thing so while I was in Japan and I was popping through some CDs and stuff like that and I apologize for the loud sound because the mic is right here so I picked up what did we talk about

1060
01:26:56,347 --> 01:26:59,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I picked up a lot more CDs than I thought I did.

1061
01:26:59,372 --> 01:27:02,056
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um... Oh, that was my controller.

1062
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:02,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well.

1063
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:03,578
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

1064
01:27:03,838 --> 01:27:04,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I have plenty more.

1065
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:14,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I picked up... There is a series of remix CDs, anime CDs, that came out in the early 2000s called Power Power Max.

1066
01:27:14,254 --> 01:27:18,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So I end up finding... Yeah, I know those.

1067
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1068
01:27:19,842 --> 01:27:23,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was only 300 yen.

1069
01:27:23,212 --> 01:27:25,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, one of those CDs you held up I've seen before.

1070
01:27:25,915 --> 01:27:27,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Jamie had it.

1071
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:29,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1072
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:30,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1073
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make sure because I think those are the ones I have.

1074
01:27:33,002 --> 01:27:37,527
[SPEAKER_07]: There's like a... Yeah, I have like a box set of those.

1075
01:27:37,567 --> 01:27:38,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that.

1076
01:27:39,949 --> 01:27:42,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the Tatsunoko one too.

1077
01:27:42,812 --> 01:27:43,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's a Tatsunoko one?

1078
01:27:44,013 --> 01:27:45,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know about that.

1079
01:27:45,114 --> 01:27:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: The Tatsunoko one is like 10 years old.

1080
01:27:49,879 --> 01:27:52,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and those are the four that I picked up.

1081
01:27:52,540 --> 01:28:00,748
[SPEAKER_02]: and while I was there, and I think this one you'll appreciate, Jamie, I grabbed this.

1082
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

1083
01:28:02,549 --> 01:28:03,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

1084
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:05,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Describe what you're holding up for the podcast, folks.

1085
01:28:05,532 --> 01:28:07,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting to that.

1086
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:16,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm holding up as a single to the song Equal Romance by the group Coco, which is that first ending, no, second ending theme to Ranma 1.5.

1087
01:28:17,864 --> 01:28:19,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that is classic right there.

1088
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:21,147
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was only...

1089
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:25,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I didn't even pay them 700 yen.

1090
01:28:27,657 --> 01:28:28,358
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad.

1091
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:33,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, CDs are really expensive, but the market for CDs is still pretty booming from what I understand.

1092
01:28:34,366 --> 01:28:40,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I did pick up both Persona 5 soundtracks for a friend because she's really into it.

1093
01:28:40,094 --> 01:28:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did get this.

1094
01:28:41,977 --> 01:28:46,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I did pick up the Super Mario Brothers movie Japanese soundtrack.

1095
01:28:46,403 --> 01:28:47,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had to.

1096
01:28:47,724 --> 01:28:48,485
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really cool.

1097
01:28:48,505 --> 01:28:48,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1098
01:28:49,409 --> 01:28:55,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could have gotten that Firebomber one, but I do have a bunch of Firebomber CDs already.

1099
01:28:55,475 --> 01:28:58,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranmari in chat is asking what store this all came from.

1100
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:09,068
[SPEAKER_02]: The Super Mario CD came from the Surugaya in Akihabara, which is like right by the Pachinko place.

1101
01:29:09,689 --> 01:29:14,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I found a couple of the Max CDs.

1102
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:15,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Equal Romance.

1103
01:29:15,654 --> 01:29:17,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where I actually found them all at.

1104
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:20,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went over to Animate.

1105
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:24,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like a little section for CD, for gaming soundtracks and CDs.

1106
01:29:24,107 --> 01:29:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's called Grate or Grato.

1107
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:31,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back and I picked up the Super Mario Brothers movie soundtrack on vinyl.

1108
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:34,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That's incredible.

1109
01:29:35,563 --> 01:29:35,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.

1110
01:29:36,083 --> 01:29:40,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm walking by and I saw, I'm like, I have it.

1111
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:42,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'll come back for it.

1112
01:29:42,813 --> 01:29:44,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came back and I picked it up.

1113
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I got for my... These are the bags that you get at Universal, which is kind of cool.

1114
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to what they give here, yeah.

1115
01:29:53,035 --> 01:29:54,236
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

1116
01:29:55,077 --> 01:30:04,988
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends... On a side note, one of my friends... Her favorite Sanrio character is one of the rarest ones to find stuff for, Choco Cat.

1117
01:30:05,008 --> 01:30:12,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happened to be in a Mega Don Quixote in Nagoya, and I found this purse for her, so...

1118
01:30:14,915 --> 01:30:33,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I find ChocoCat stuff at Daiso out here a lot.

1119
01:30:34,085 --> 01:30:41,314
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that does not surprise me, because I found a lot of ChocoCat stuff at Universal when I went back in December.

1120
01:30:41,795 --> 01:30:51,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But because ChocoCat's not that popular in Japan, you're not going to find much on that character, which was kind of shocking that I found stuff.

1121
01:30:51,106 --> 01:30:55,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I keep looking for Little Twin Stars stuff, because that's my jam.

1122
01:30:55,932 --> 01:30:59,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw some stuff here in Little Twin Stars, um...

1123
01:31:00,578 --> 01:31:28,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1124
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:31,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Ranma, when are you planning your next trip?

1125
01:31:32,572 --> 01:31:43,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm actually thinking next year because this time around, I have a few more friends in Japan and I want to spend more time hanging out with them because there's a few I have not seen in years.

1126
01:31:43,648 --> 01:31:56,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the things that happened with my trip this year was the friend that came with me was, this was like her related birthday gift from her parents and the trip was my birthday gift to myself, so we ran into a lot of

1127
01:31:56,384 --> 01:31:58,009
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to do a lot of culture stuff.

1128
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:00,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do a lot of weeb stuff.

1129
01:32:00,195 --> 01:32:05,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of compromises made here and there and some stuff had to get cut off.

1130
01:32:06,393 --> 01:32:07,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1131
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:12,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have at least one friend moving to Japan, maybe two in the next year.

1132
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:14,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's a big country.

1133
01:32:14,336 --> 01:32:17,499
[SPEAKER_07]: They may not be in the same place, but they have the transit to get you there.

1134
01:32:17,539 --> 01:32:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I love the transit system.

1135
01:32:21,323 --> 01:32:23,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three different tap cards.

1136
01:32:24,686 --> 01:32:28,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's six different tap cards, but they all work one with each other.

1137
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:31,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just certain areas have certain ones.

1138
01:32:32,173 --> 01:32:36,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that the Suika was the major one for just about everything.

1139
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:42,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically it is, but I have a Suica, I have a Pasmo, and an Iokoka card.

1140
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:44,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But they all work one and the same.

1141
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:47,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that different regions promote certain different ones.

1142
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:52,711
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want to do when I get to go?

1143
01:32:53,072 --> 01:32:56,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do what I am dubbing the Ekibentor.

1144
01:32:57,759 --> 01:32:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ekibentor?

1145
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:05,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I eat at every train station I can and have their signature bento.

1146
01:33:07,715 --> 01:33:14,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, riding the Shinkansen with a bento and a drink was top tier for me.

1147
01:33:18,028 --> 01:33:22,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, SJ100Bat was asking about games.

1148
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1149
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:30,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you the same thing when it comes to looking for games as is looking for, like, anime merch and so forth.

1150
01:33:32,867 --> 01:33:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I may...

1151
01:33:34,563 --> 01:33:40,950
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1152
01:33:45,455 --> 01:34:00,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

1153
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what would you say, Jamie?

1154
01:34:02,002 --> 01:34:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on, please.

1155
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:13,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, people would actually hate, I think, going with me, because one of the big things on my, like, bucket list is the Shikoku Pilgrimage.

1156
01:34:13,097 --> 01:34:15,040
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shikoku Pilgrimage?

1157
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:23,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an island of about 88 temples, and you walk the island and get stamped at each of the temples that you go to.

1158
01:34:23,131 --> 01:34:27,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a couple of days of a hike, and you can sometimes stay at some of the different shrines.

1159
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where I put it.

1160
01:34:31,972 --> 01:34:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably my bad.

1161
01:34:35,196 --> 01:34:40,844
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest thing to stamping I did was you can get stamped at the different train stations as you travel.

1162
01:34:40,864 --> 01:34:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to do that too.

1163
01:34:43,047 --> 01:34:43,928
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

1164
01:34:44,409 --> 01:34:47,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stampers are outside, others are inside.

1165
01:34:48,013 --> 01:34:52,579
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't see them, if you ask the station master, they'll tell you where to go.

1166
01:34:53,761 --> 01:34:55,864
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to deals, I'm going to tell you this right now.

1167
01:34:56,965 --> 01:35:00,510
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see something good in Akihabara, write it down.

1168
01:35:01,081 --> 01:35:03,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1169
01:35:03,844 --> 01:35:26,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1170
01:35:26,731 --> 01:35:27,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I will wait.

1171
01:35:27,512 --> 01:35:28,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not bad.

1172
01:35:28,573 --> 01:35:31,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Went to Nakano Broadway, found it sealed for $1,680.

1173
01:35:31,856 --> 01:35:32,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1174
01:35:32,636 --> 01:35:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: That's even better.

1175
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:37,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Because here's the thing.

1176
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're online and you see like these awesome T-Mode style, all these anime figures that are going for $30 and $40 and so forth, understand that's two to three times the retail price in Japan because it's covering cost of shipping and so forth.

1177
01:35:55,677 --> 01:35:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And here...

1178
01:35:56,718 --> 01:35:59,161
[SPEAKER_02]: These figures are rare.

1179
01:35:59,181 --> 01:35:59,942
[SPEAKER_02]: These are unique.

1180
01:35:59,982 --> 01:36:02,005
[SPEAKER_02]: These are one of a kind.

1181
01:36:02,025 --> 01:36:03,968
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, it's a dime a dozen.

1182
01:36:04,228 --> 01:36:08,434
[SPEAKER_02]: These are basically Tonka Toys in Japan.

1183
01:36:08,834 --> 01:36:12,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say Tonka Toys, but basically that's what it is.

1184
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Figures I've paid, I was going to pay anywhere between $30 and $40.

1185
01:36:17,566 --> 01:36:22,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid no more than $11 to $10 to $15 a pop.

1186
01:36:22,713 --> 01:36:22,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

1187
01:36:25,591 --> 01:36:27,173
[SPEAKER_01]: That's easier to eat cheaper.

1188
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:29,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

1189
01:36:29,194 --> 01:36:35,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're looking for rare games, yes, start in Akihabara, but go to the book-offs.

1190
01:36:36,221 --> 01:36:39,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Check for the book-off super bazaars, the book-off pluses.

1191
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:44,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will have a larger selection of retro games.

1192
01:36:46,591 --> 01:36:48,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The out-of-the-way animates.

1193
01:36:48,113 --> 01:36:55,140
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an animate in a mall in Kyoto that had tons of Famicom games there that you can go through.

1194
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:55,480
Ooh.

1195
01:36:56,928 --> 01:37:02,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to get a Famicom disc system at some point, although I imagine finding discs that still work could be a challenge.

1196
01:37:03,257 --> 01:37:04,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, usually no.

1197
01:37:05,059 --> 01:37:09,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a book off where they were selling a lot of the Famicom disc games.

1198
01:37:09,806 --> 01:37:10,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's cool.

1199
01:37:11,468 --> 01:37:15,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a book off in Ikebukuro near Sunshine City.

1200
01:37:15,834 --> 01:37:17,957
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like a whole display of them.

1201
01:37:18,224 --> 01:37:25,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to a Super Potato, I promise you, you will find one of them selling a Famicom Disk System to pick up.

1202
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:29,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say you're probably going to spend no more than $100 on it, give or take.

1203
01:37:30,296 --> 01:37:31,077
[SPEAKER_02]: $150 tops.

1204
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:31,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1205
01:37:32,899 --> 01:37:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Dr. Seuss says be careful of the drive belts.

1206
01:37:34,841 --> 01:37:40,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would be a pain to transport, but I think a neat collector's item.

1207
01:37:40,727 --> 01:37:41,047
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1208
01:37:41,828 --> 01:37:46,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that I did have to pick up a Sega Saturn for a friend because he moved to Germany and...

1209
01:37:47,755 --> 01:37:52,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Movers, moving his stuff, they damaged the Saturn, so I got him another one.

1210
01:37:53,883 --> 01:38:01,752
[SPEAKER_02]: US conversion, 92 bucks, and I think it was like $50 to ship to Germany, so it wasn't so bad.

1211
01:38:01,772 --> 01:38:03,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well Ranma, it sounds like you had a great trip.

1212
01:38:03,835 --> 01:38:09,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show here, but yeah, I enjoyed hearing about your adventures and making me a little jealous, I gotta be honest.

1213
01:38:10,623 --> 01:38:13,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, tell you what, I have a friend named Rose that

1214
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:16,992
[SPEAKER_02]: When you and Alan are ready, come out, talk to us.

1215
01:38:17,193 --> 01:38:19,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We will help you plan this so you can have a great time.

1216
01:38:19,982 --> 01:38:20,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1217
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm into it.

1218
01:38:21,648 --> 01:38:22,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm into it.

1219
01:38:23,093 --> 01:38:24,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's one thing.

1220
01:38:24,718 --> 01:38:25,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have a couple things.

1221
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: One,

1222
01:38:27,209 --> 01:38:31,116
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need a lot of cash on hand because so many places take card.

1223
01:38:31,536 --> 01:38:38,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you find yourself doing big shopping, just put it on your card, do the US equivalent, save a few dollars.

1224
01:38:38,308 --> 01:38:40,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You might pay two bucks on a $200 purchase.

1225
01:38:40,892 --> 01:38:43,377
[SPEAKER_07]: No, certain cards will even do the translation for free.

1226
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:44,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been able to do it in Mexico.

1227
01:38:44,679 --> 01:38:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought cheap fucking hats in Mexico that would cost me $80 here.

1228
01:38:47,824 --> 01:38:48,846
[SPEAKER_07]: It cost me like $15.

1229
01:38:49,407 --> 01:38:51,471
[SPEAKER_07]: They're probably knockoffs, but I can't tell the difference.

1230
01:38:51,491 --> 01:38:52,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So who cares?

1231
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:52,937
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1232
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:59,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if you don't need specialty like body soap and lotions and stuff, just use what they have in the hotel.

1233
01:38:59,344 --> 01:39:07,592
[SPEAKER_02]: But I promise you, your skin is going to be a lot cleaner, a lot nicer, and if you have dye in your hair, it's going to kind of come out.

1234
01:39:07,752 --> 01:39:08,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't have air, so it's fine.

1235
01:39:11,055 --> 01:39:11,375
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

1236
01:39:11,635 --> 01:39:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I am going to be going at all the skincare stores.

1237
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:16,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

1238
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,303
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just no ifs, ands, or buts about that.

1239
01:39:19,323 --> 01:39:20,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan loves that stuff, too.

1240
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:21,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1241
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:24,840
[SPEAKER_01]: y'all are gonna go into overload when you see all

1242
01:39:25,698 --> 01:39:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I'm staying in Akihabara is at least five to six drug and beauty stores, like literally right there.

1243
01:39:31,987 --> 01:39:34,871
[SPEAKER_02]: If not outside, we go down into the shopping mall.

1244
01:39:35,612 --> 01:39:38,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like one of the other highlights of my trip.

1245
01:39:38,776 --> 01:39:44,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fact that I'm going through these subway malls and these malls and it's not dead.

1246
01:39:44,364 --> 01:39:48,129
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people walking around shopping and enjoying themselves.

1247
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like a kid in the 90s going through the malls, okay?

1248
01:39:52,736 --> 01:39:52,836
Yeah.

1249
01:39:52,816 --> 01:40:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: also I want to go to the thrift stores in Shibuya that sell the resell designer stuff oh you don't have to go to Shibuya oh no there's like five specific stores there I want to go to

1250
01:40:08,543 --> 01:40:16,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, because there's like six in the Kyoto shopping arcade in the hotel that I stayed by, and it's just, yeah.

1251
01:40:17,534 --> 01:40:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did get some clothes.

1252
01:40:19,216 --> 01:40:25,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself a nice kimono for, you know, to wear during the winter, and a couple of jinbeis for the summertime, so I'm happy about that.

1253
01:40:26,746 --> 01:40:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1254
01:40:27,687 --> 01:40:28,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be comfortable.

1255
01:40:28,692 --> 01:40:32,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ranma, well we look forward to hearing more on Tuesday on Anime Jam Session.

1256
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:34,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be next Tuesday.

1257
01:40:34,579 --> 01:40:39,164
[SPEAKER_02]: This Tuesday I'm still resting, relaxing, and putting my notes together properly for a good show.

1258
01:40:39,224 --> 01:40:39,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fair.

1259
01:40:39,865 --> 01:40:40,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, next Tuesday.

1260

[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing stuff.

1270
01:41:51,886 --> 01:41:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, well, and he deserves it.

1271
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:55,571
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 years in business.

1272
01:41:56,733 --> 01:41:56,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1273
01:41:57,174 --> 01:41:58,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a staple.

1274
01:41:58,135 --> 01:41:59,677
[SPEAKER_04]: People have grown up with this place.

1275
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Earned that retirement.

1276
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:08,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just a little bit more of a local thing, but it's such a big part of, you know, Bay Area and Northern California.

1277
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:15,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy your retirement, Onishi-san.

1278
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:16,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You deserve it.

1279
01:42:18,144 --> 01:42:18,525
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1280
01:42:18,605 --> 01:42:21,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Loki, let me check in with you for any other last minute stories.

1281
01:42:22,463 --> 01:42:24,066
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1282
01:42:24,086 --> 01:42:28,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess we're just all eagerly awaiting the Switch 2 and Summer Game Fest this week.

1283
01:42:29,516 --> 01:42:31,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So next week is going to be a huge show.

1284
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:33,342
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a lot of ground to cover.

1285
01:42:33,362 --> 01:42:35,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope to see you here next week.

1286
01:42:35,506 --> 01:42:39,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Except, DarkSakura, you're not here because of a conflict with your ballet stuff.

1287
01:42:41,016 --> 01:42:41,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my ballet recital.

1288
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:44,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but that's certainly understandable.

1289
01:42:44,442 --> 01:42:47,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will hold down the fort while you're gone.

1290
01:42:48,130 --> 01:43:08,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you what, wish me no, in ballet you don't say break a leg, you say merd yes, it means shit yes, well they say that a lot in Claire Obscure too, so anyway I wanted to say thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio if you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show

1291
01:43:08,245 --> 01:43:12,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1292
01:43:12,511 --> 01:43:18,060
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found the show goes an awful long way.

1293
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,964
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for helping us to get the word out.

1294
