1
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I even write a June intro at this point?

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,624
[SPEAKER_02]: The headline has been a foregone conclusion for the entirety of the show's life.

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I can let the music run alone, it's a bop.

4
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:22,995
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I should, especially since I started avoiding the lead story, though that's harder when the entire show is basically made up of one overarching story.

5
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:29,143
[SPEAKER_02]: When I want to reference the lead, I pick one specific aspect about it, not quite burying the lead, but shining a light on an interesting aspect of it.

6
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:34,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just the intro voice, the warm-up act, the 30 seconds plus or minus 10 to bring you into the next few hours of news.

7
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:39,439
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the meta intro because you can probably guess what the show is going to cover, but which of the two stories are going to be the lead?

8
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:43,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the very active week in gaming news.

9
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:50,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.

11
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:55,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:58,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:03,349
[SPEAKER_01]: And poor Jason, our hardworking voiceover guy, I think has analysis paralysis with everything.

14
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:29,792
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

15
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:33,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week I'm joined by my co-host, except not tonight, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

16
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:40,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, was unable to attend tonight as, you know, she talks a lot about her ballet hobby and dance passion and stuff.

17
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:43,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has a big event for all of that going on tonight.

18
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So she wasn't able to be here as well, but she'll be back next week.

19
00:01:46,494 --> 00:01:49,318
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have the one and only Techmaster Loki here tonight.

20
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:49,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Loki.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,861
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?

23
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:53,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing all right.

24
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a busy week for games, hasn't it?

25
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:56,874
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure has.

26
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:03,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just me or is this the closest it's felt to like an E3 week since COVID lockdowns, since like 2020?

27
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:07,681
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, this feels the closest to like E3 week since those days.

28
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:13,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I mean, it feels like this every year when we do, when they have Summer Games Fest and all this stuff.

29
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:14,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it though?

30
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:24,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like the games from like Sony and Microsoft and, you know, maybe Nintendo hasn't had the announcements, but their console launch is sort of an announcement.

31
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of, you know, a similar thing.

32
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:29,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I feel like that sort of uplifts

33
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:55,011
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:02:54,991 --> 00:03:18,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Forge is overly generic.

35
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

36
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:24,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like Summer Game Fest has kind of always been in that weird sort of mid spot.

37
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:36,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when it comes to what they do with the Game Awards, I don't know if it's because it's a different time of year or what, but that's always felt like the announcements there are sort of a little bit elevated compared to what we have at Summer Game Fest.

38
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:39,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm trying to choose my words carefully here because I'm not trying to knock on it.

39
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the event.

40
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I know especially since there isn't an E3, it's something to do in the LA area.

41
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:49,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there were things that I liked in that as well, but I just, I don't know.

42
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:56,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get as excited about that as I do the Game Awards, and then I'm really taking the whole thing into account.

43
00:03:56,775 --> 00:04:01,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, just the fact, and honestly, Loki, it's not just also...

44
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:08,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo console, Sony event, Xbox event, Summer Game Fest, but then it's like everything else around Summer Game Fest, right?

45
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:20,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Day of the Devs, then there's a Devolver thing, then there's a women-fronted game announcements, there's, you know, BIPOC game announcements, there's all these, like, industry...

46
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:35,113
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I feel like it's kind of energizing.

47
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:51,769
[SPEAKER_01]: E3VL Overwhelmed by content

48
00:04:51,749 --> 00:05:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

49
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to catch up.

50
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:11,298
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty.

51
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,840
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what social media is for.

52
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:15,505
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what news gaming websites are for.

53
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:16,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I got caught up.

54
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:17,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what they talked about.

55
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,434
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't always watch everything live in the moment, and that's okay.

56
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,299
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't feel too overwhelmed this time of year.

57
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:34,075
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see every game on the E3 show floor back in the day, and you can't watch every single games announcement this time of year either.

58
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:46,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well then the other thing that sort of complicates people's ability to watch gaming wrap-ups and summaries and announcements is that a new console got dropped on people's laps this week.

59
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:47,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally!

60
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,831
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big week.

61
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that face you're making, Loki.

62
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a console.

63
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:54,677
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a console?

64
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:59,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're gonna call this ROGLI, which there have already been some in the past.

65
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the Switch 2, Loki!

66
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:15,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought you were talking about that.

67
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:29,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is a new console.

68
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:57,960
[SPEAKER_01]: so this and you know uh it's it's a big we haven't had a console launch since 2020 and we all know that 2020 was fucky and the consoles didn't really launch the same way we didn't have like the big midnight midnight releases and shit like we had so if you think about it this would be the first time we've had like a major midnight console release lines at best buy and shit since what the switch one probably the switch one was probably the last time we had this

69
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,887
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a throwback in some ways.

70
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk about the Switch 2.

71
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:06,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, you got yours over the weekend, right?

72
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:07,576
[SPEAKER_01]: How did the launch go for you?

73
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:08,678
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your console.

74
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,561
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you been kind of like playing on it?

75
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Mario Kart World.

76
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:17,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't really been playing because my son took it and I haven't been able to see it since then.

77
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:18,514
[SPEAKER_01]: The joys of family.

78
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:30,995
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I set it all up and everything, and I did play through Grand Prix, and I watched him play some of the stuff, but, like, yeah, I mean, you know, Mario Kart World is certainly a gorgeous-looking game.

79
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:41,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... It's, like, it's... I think everything with, like, the Switch 2 seems to be, like, this is really great, but then there's this one thing that's just, like, not quite right.

80
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:42,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why?

81
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this a thing?

82
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,421
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, in Mario Kart...

83
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,057
[SPEAKER_03]: World, one of the things that kind of stood out to me is kind of weird.

84
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:59,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from, like, the fact that you can't do co-op free roam split screen, which, like, really?

85
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:02,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Your console cannot handle that?

86
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm just...

87
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:09,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused as to why that's such a thing.

88
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Why your game is so unoptimized in that sense that it really cannot run that.

89
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it, the world is big and everything, but we were doing split-screen, open-world racing games back on the Xbox 360 just fine.

90
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:25,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is this any different?

91
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't...

92
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:44,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't fathom that.

93
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:55,456
[SPEAKER_03]: When you do that, the game drops down the level of detail incredibly low, and the framerate is so low on that.

94
00:08:56,158 --> 00:08:58,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, it's just like...

95
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Why was this even a thing that you added to the game?

96
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this a feature in the game when it doesn't represent the game very well?

97
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:13,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really add anything, and it really shows... This brand new console that you just put out shows how underpowered it is.

98
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:18,124
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so confusing to me why they would even treat it like that.

99
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:19,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

100
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:43,167
[SPEAKER_03]: and that aside too like you know I'm hearing now with like the teardowns of the Switch 2 and stuff like that and the Joy-Cons and how oh hey the Joy-Con it seems like that the thumbsticks are exactly the same as the old ones so cool so we're gonna get drifting issues with these $90 controllers in like a few months I mean like do we not learn our lesson with this stuff I just don't understand but

101
00:09:43,923 --> 00:09:51,250
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of like my whole take on it it's like it's a really good piece of hardware that game is you know really good but like

102
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm holding it to that $80 price point standard.

103
00:09:55,997 --> 00:10:03,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff that's in there just feels poorly implemented in this generation of gaming.

104
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.

105
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:08,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain games don't have split screen and stuff like that anymore.

106
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,529
[SPEAKER_03]: But it feels like you could have possibly been able to implement that somehow.

107
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:16,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine that...

108
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

109
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

110
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I agree.

111
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have to be honest.

112
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:47,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't spent a ton of time on Mario because I've been playing something else, and I'll talk about that in a minute.

113
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:57,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't been playing as much Mario Kart World because I've been going back and visiting Switch 1 upgraded games and playing them the way I really wish I would have been able to play them from the beginning.

114
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:15,372
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do think you have a point that like when you're in the free realm and maybe this is because of the fact that the tracks have been scoped out to hold 24 people when you're on them by yourself the the free roam actually kind of feels a little bit empty now I've played I've played a very which and

115
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:18,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Before y'all come at me, because I know the Nintendo fans are ready to snap.

116
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:31,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I've seen all the really cute artistic flares and some of the things that only Nintendo can do, like the buses loading up people and the drive-thru where Yoshi is actually working at the drive-thru and waves throughout the window.

117
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:36,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm not saying the world is devout of life, but it does seem very odd.

118
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:40,789
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like two very different sort of design choices, right?

119
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: You have racetracks that are wide enough to support...

120
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:47,460
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 people, which is a lot for a Mario Kart game.

121
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,648
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have this free roam that's limited to just you, right?

122
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:54,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, I know there's ways to... Yeah, there's the workaround.

123
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,455
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

124
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:59,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so we can do a workaround and get it to somewhat work.

125
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not just make that the thing?

126
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:07,696
[SPEAKER_01]: My honest question is, is free roam really bringing enough to this game?

127
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:09,159
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I don't know yet.

128
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that yet.

129
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:11,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it enough yet.

130
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'm going to come back in a couple months and change my mind.

131
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was a big highlight of their...

132
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:39,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even the most hardcore of the Nintendo fans need to really stop for a moment and pause and maybe consider the people bitching about the $80 price tag have a point.

133
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh... But, the game is fun!

134
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:46,964
[SPEAKER_03]: You could balance that.

135
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:50,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You could balance that with, you know, free roam.

136
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:56,101
[SPEAKER_03]: You could even tone it down, like, detail-wise for multiplayer, if you want.

137
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, like, multiplayer games have been doing forever when it comes to split-screen.

138
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:01,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

139
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,737
[SPEAKER_01]: The racing is really fun and I really like the knockout tour.

140
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:06,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the one giant long track.

141
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:08,750
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really fun, I'm going to say.

142
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:14,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that the free world approach, I guess, sort of brings to the game that wouldn't have been there otherwise.

143
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:17,192
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do really like the free roam element.

144
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:21,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, the knockout element and how it utilizes the free roam.

145
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:23,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that.

146
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:28,926
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does feel very different from other Mario Kart games, which isn't a bad thing.

147
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:29,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right?

148
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:35,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think we'd also be bitching if it was like, oh, it's just the same fucking Mario Kart game with some new tracks.

149
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the creative push to do something really different.

150
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:45,007
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a little bit jarring when the first eight Mario Kart games have essentially been the same thing.

151
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:45,407
Yeah.

152
00:13:45,387 --> 00:14:05,607
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

153
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally fine with the new take on it.

154
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:10,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good.

155
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:21,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoilers, sort of, I guess, but there is a Mario Circuit track that goes through the first three Mario Circuits from the Super Nintendo game, one after another.

156
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,916
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super cool.

157
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:32,024
[SPEAKER_01]: The end of that first circuit that has the Donkey Kong rafters, that's incredible.

158
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:34,847
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the course design is phenomenal.

159
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:35,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

160
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's really good.

161
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:37,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, hold on.

162
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:38,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Alan's here.

163
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:42,415
[SPEAKER_01]: He just made a Costco trip, and I think he brought me... Oh, boy.

164
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:43,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

165
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Tariff free.

166
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Look what Alan got me at Costco.

167
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,263
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller.

168
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know why this is important?

169
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:52,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from Costco?

170
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:54,014
[SPEAKER_01]: $75.

171
00:14:54,335 --> 00:15:00,869
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to pay for the tariffs and all that stuff because you get the Costco discount for being a Costco member.

172
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:01,550
[SPEAKER_01]: That's terrific.

173
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:03,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It is terrific.

174
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure is because we're going to buy all the food we fucking eat there anyway.

175
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no, it's great.

176
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:18,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want it to be like, you know, it's like, I'm not saying the game's bad at any means whatsoever.

177
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:23,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, like, I am going to scrutinize it extra hard because it is $80.

178
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:23,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

179
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fair.

180
00:15:26,804 --> 00:15:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

181
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,910
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first game to ever charge $80.

182
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:41,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we should be saying, what does this bring to the conversation that justifies $10 more than, you know, some of these new PlayStation 5 games and things like that?

183
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:42,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

184
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:50,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think... So here's my prediction here, and this is strictly based off of Mario Kart World.

185
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:56,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So my prediction in the future with how they're going to approach adding... Because how do you add new tracks to this?

186
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously...

187
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,016
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is already existing the way it is, so how do you add new tracks to it?

188
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they don't.

189
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:17,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think instead they go the route of Grand Theft Auto 5 Online, where you can basically take this big open world and then create your own courses based off of driving from place to place and setting up stuff along that route and save that and share that.

190
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be a thing I predict that will come in the future.

191
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with E3VL in chat.

192
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Islands, do it the way Forza does it.

193
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:24,910
Yeah.

194
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:37,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this game's, yeah, islands, warp pipes, warp pipes, you drive in a warp pipe, and you go, come on, the perfect Nintendo answer, warp pipes, that's how you're gonna do it.

195
00:16:38,542 --> 00:17:07,232
[SPEAKER_03]: so anyway what else about the Switch, so where did you get yours from because you got yours delivered to your house you didn't actually go to any midnight launches it's annoying because it did get delivered after the release date by a couple days despite the fact that I was literally their second one to order that thing so it's kind of annoying that somehow everybody got before me but whatever, we got it it's no big deal that it was a day or so late yeah

196
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:13,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's really, you know, Mario Kart was the only reason, you know, the only thing that we got on it right now.

197
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We did all the transfer stuff.

198
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:25,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I am scared to look at it because I've heard of horror stories where people have transferred their content and their saves and their Animal Crossing worlds are gone.

199
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:25,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.

200
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:28,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, I'm not...

201
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:51,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got it.

202
00:17:51,104 --> 00:18:10,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta go and delete that stuff yeah that's the kind of thing I wish it gave me the option to like toggle what I wanted to move over or just like hey move over like the game card stuff but don't re-download everything just allow you to download it that's how it should have been but I don't know it's fine I guess and then um

203
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:15,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the eShop seems a little bit better, slightly.

204
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usable, I guess.

205
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much snappier.

206
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,664
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing about the Switch.

207
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just snappier in every sense of the word.

208
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:28,933
[SPEAKER_01]: The interface is snappier, and the magnetic connection thing is so sad.

209
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:35,481
[SPEAKER_01]: People are calling it the fidget toy of the year, although I'm not sure I would want to sit there and attach, reattach, reattach, reattach over and over and over again.

210
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:41,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like at some point, you're going to run the risk of wearing that shit out.

211
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:53,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I had issues syncing my old Joy-Cons with it.

212
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have an older set of Joy-Cons I got back closer to when I got my Switch originally.

213
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have a newer set I just bought for my wife not that long ago that are pink or whatever.

214
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,673
[SPEAKER_03]: The pink ones were able to sync just fine.

215
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:08,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones...

216
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:19,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to connect them to one of those controller attachment things and then plug it in to the Switch directly to get it to recognize.

217
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:24,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I unplugged it and tried to use them again, it wouldn't sync again.

218
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:30,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of annoying as well on a $500 piece of hardware.

219
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,523
[SPEAKER_03]: That it should work just fine with your controllers because I got them to connect one time.

220
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:37,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they...

221
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Detected again.

222
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't that I had the other switch on or anything in the room, so I was confused as to which system to connect to.

223
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:49,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely shut off, so I don't know.

224
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of annoying.

225
00:19:52,115 --> 00:20:02,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I'm going to scrutinize this stuff extra hard because it is that expensive, and I expect perfect if I'm paying $80 for a game and $500 for a system.

226
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:07,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about my little launch night story.

227
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a pre-order from Best Buy.

228
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:16,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went over there and thankfully, and I didn't even realize this was going to be a thing until like two days before.

229
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,280
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently we get West Coast privilege being in California.

230
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were actually going to launch the system at 9pm our time because when it's 9pm here, it's midnight on the East Coast, which they do with some movies, right?

231
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,357
[SPEAKER_01]: We

232
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:55,787
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

233
00:20:55,767 --> 00:21:03,476
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think at some point the rule changed, but I wasn't really thinking about it until a couple days before the console launch.

234
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:04,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went over there.

235
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,720
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a little shopping beforehand.

236
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, they'll probably have separate lines.

237
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,728
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them will be for people who haven't gotten the console yet.

238
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:15,932
[SPEAKER_01]: One will be for pre-orders, and that pre-order will go fast.

239
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:20,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kind of rolled up around 9.15.

240
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:21,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And the line was already going.

241
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one line going all the way around the building to the back.

242
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,827
[SPEAKER_01]: We were out by the dumpsters.

243
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:33,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made some very funny tongue-in-cheek comments like, Happy Pride Month.

244
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,694
[SPEAKER_01]: They made us gaze-wait out by the dumpsters.

245
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:35,775
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, things like that.

246
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:36,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever.

247
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:37,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fair.

248
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,860
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew we were taking a chance, rolling in there late.

249
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not upset about it.

250
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:52,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny to look in the dumpster and see that there was Switch 1 standees and promo material for the original Switch that was sitting in the dumpster.

251
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:59,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised some of those Nintendo fanboys in line weren't dumpster diving to take that stuff because, I mean, people do that.

252
00:21:59,931 --> 00:22:00,612
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was there.

253
00:22:01,713 --> 00:22:04,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So we waited and waited and waited and we got towards the front of the line.

254
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:08,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they started splitting it to two when you got towards the front.

255
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:31,063
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

256
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:46,842
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:22:46,822 --> 00:23:02,569
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

258
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:09,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought of it like Disneyland, except instead of getting on Space Mountain at the end, I was going to get a new console, which I haven't had in five years.

259
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:10,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what?

260
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:11,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Wee!

261
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:12,369
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.

262
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:14,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for a ride.

263
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:14,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was fine.

264
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:19,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got our system, came home, and then it was that long process of transferring everything over.

265
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:23,190
[SPEAKER_01]: But props to Nintendo for the servers not melting down.

266
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't too bad.

267
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:30,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that Mario Kart World was going to be a code instead of an actual full game.

268
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:34,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a code, and so I had to put the code in and download it, but it went through.

269
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:40,394
[SPEAKER_01]: It was relatively fast, and I was playing Pokemon Scarlet, which was the first game I wanted to play.

270
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:44,340
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute I heard it was 60 frames a second, and when I saw the early footage, I was like, oh my god.

271
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So my old save to load up by default in Scarlet, I was just blown away.

272
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is...

273
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:59,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I was torn between this is an all-new game and this is the game we should have had the first time.

274
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:01,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't help Loki.

275
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people wish I would shut up.

276
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

277
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is no.

278
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:13,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get out of my head that this really was supposed to be how it was supposed to be for us when this game launched.

279
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,743
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just...

280
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:23,818
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too smooth and too good and too fast for this to be made or whatever for me not to believe that this is the way it was really supposed to be the whole time.

281
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:27,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think this Switch 2 was supposed to happen around the time we got the OLED Switch.

282
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:39,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not with the same specs, maybe not in the exact same way, but I really believe that technology is, you know, it was out there for some developers and they were developing to it.

283
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:41,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why some of the later Switch games

284
00:24:41,707 --> 00:24:56,728
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

285
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not perfect.

286
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:04,801
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some weird bugs with floating Pokeballs and shadows do weird things, but it feels like the world is alive.

287
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:07,966
[SPEAKER_01]: You really do see the Pokemon in the background doing things.

288
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:11,091
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just walking by like a game and watch.

289
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:16,059
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually walking, doing the thing in the grass, watching what's happening, getting behind you.

290
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,463
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like the world's alive.

291
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:20,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a better game now.

292
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:26,841
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just saying that because I happened to catch a shiny Fletchling like 15 minutes into my play when I was streaming the other night.

293
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does feel like an elevated experience.

294
00:25:29,306 --> 00:25:33,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a stupid take on social media, which what a surprise.

295
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:34,858
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of stupid takes.

296
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But I saw a stupid take that was...

297
00:25:37,023 --> 00:25:43,952
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just got a Switch 2 to play Switch 1 games, you're a problem because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

298
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:45,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And my answer to that is, fuck you.

299
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:46,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit down.

300
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:46,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

301
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everything needs to be posted on the internet.

302
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:50,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know what?

303
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:56,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do people buy higher-end PCs so that they can play their PC games at a better frame rate?

304
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:02,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Do people buy new PCs, new MMOs, like when a new World of Warcraft expansion comes out?

305
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:03,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I play on my higher-end PC?

306
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:04,178
Yeah.

307
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:05,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Minecraft, right?

308
00:26:06,822 --> 00:26:07,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

309
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:10,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

310
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:13,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Let people enjoy things.

311
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:21,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to buy a Switch 2 to re-enjoy your Switch 1 games, that's one of the best things this console has going for it out the gate.

312
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:22,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's be real.

313
00:26:22,585 --> 00:26:27,052
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like one new game that isn't on another console right now.

314
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:29,355
[SPEAKER_01]: One new game exclusive to Switch.

315
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: in the moment and that's Mario Kart World now next month we'll have the Donkey Kong game soon we'll have Metroid Prime we'll see more stuff from third parties you know and I'm not saying things like Fantasy Life are probably a better experience on Switch 2 because of its portability than PlayStation 5 but that's the reality there isn't a lot to make this really special so I just don't understand where a take like that comes from to be honest

316
00:26:56,673 --> 00:27:06,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see, uh, Rinmari68k in chat says gamers think politics and game communities are bad, but would gladly break toes of people who buy a Nintendo game they want.

317
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:07,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

318
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Truxius, I hope I said that name right.

319
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:13,179
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's True, True, Truexius, Truexius, I think.

320
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:13,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if I'm saying that wrong.

321
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:17,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Says I played PS4 games on my PS5 for a long time.

322
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:18,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

323
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:19,189
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

324
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:23,035
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still releasing PlayStation 4 games on PlayStation 5.

325
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:25,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, a lot of the things that weren't out.

326
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,182
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 4.

327
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,389
[SPEAKER_01]: That brand new Capcom fighting collection.

328
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,712
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a PS4 game.

329
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:32,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are still playing it.

330
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:34,780
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with it.

331
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:36,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

332
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:38,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

333
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.

334
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Rin Mari in chat says, honestly, as obnoxious as Nintendo stands can be, Nintendo haters can be not right in the head either.

335
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:47,052
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for sure.

336
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:47,873
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.

337
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:51,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the gorilla 72 in chat asks, damn, where did he get that Donkey Kong cap?

338
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:51,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I want one.

339
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.

340
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:54,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't remember where this came from.

341
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:56,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to say it's a few years old, but look at the best part.

342
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:22,722
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

343
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:27,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, entire class says you can probably find it online.

344
00:28:27,826 --> 00:28:34,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably look for, I should probably look up the tag on who made this hat and see what other gaming hats they might have.

345
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would like to see if they have maybe some Zelda themed ones or some other ones that have the stuff.

346
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:42,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just when I also, and this last thing I'll say that we can best switch to.

347
00:28:42,057 --> 00:29:01,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like hats that bend I like the bendy look on hats you know like some more like baseball hats no baseball hats are flat and trucker hats bend so I like the trucker hats a little better but this one's more of a flat one this is just taking a long time to get like just a little bendy so I don't love the flat ones as much as the bendy ones

348
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:04,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that's my hat hot take.

349
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,442
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, back to Switch 2 hot takes.

350
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:11,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Loki, what are you looking forward to next on Switch 2?

351
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you think happens with Switch 2 a few months down the line?

352
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll probably get the Donkey Kong game just because it looks alright.

353
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:22,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not super excited about Donkey Kong.

354
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:32,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, probably we'll end up getting the new Sonic Racing Crossworlds game for obvious reasons.

355
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:35,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

356
00:29:36,373 --> 00:29:38,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really interested in Metroid Prime 4.

357
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to see what else gets announced.

358
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really.

359
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:47,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unlike you, I'm very interested in Metroid Prime 4, so that's going to be next on my list.

360
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:49,496
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if I'm sold on Donkey Kong.

361
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:50,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to wait and see.

362
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking a wait-and-see approach to that one.

363
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:54,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I need that one launch day, but I'll wait.

364
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to see how the GameCube collection expands.

365
00:29:57,152 --> 00:29:59,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, have you tried any of the GameCube stuff?

366
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not yet, no.

367
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:01,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice.

368
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:10,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's just an effect of the emulator that you're using or whatever, but similar to some things you see on PC and like Dolphin and stuff.

369
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:23,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those emulators are operating on a more level of trying to enhance the experience, whereas I think Nintendo is probably trying to do something that's really portable.

370
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:27,546
[SPEAKER_01]: But because you now have things that are more textures and less sprites...

371
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:38,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when I'm playing... I didn't play F-Zero yet because I'm going to do that on stream, but I played a little bit of Soul Calibur 2, and it was kind of neat to see that, wow, on the TV, this looks a little sharper.

372
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:45,549
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anything is up-res per se, but it's the Illustrator versus Photoshop, right?

373
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:52,758
[SPEAKER_01]: When you up-res a vector graphic, it's going to look a little better than a bitmap graphic that Photoshop makes because it's just that resolution.

374
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:53,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's also because...

375
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:57,426
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you first played it, you were playing it on a CRT TV as well.

376
00:30:57,446 --> 00:30:58,047
[SPEAKER_01]: That is fair.

377
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:58,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally fair.

378
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

379
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:01,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looked a little different back then.

380
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:10,068
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Ranma S in chat, I think he's talking about something else, but the comment made about it doesn't connect to your phone, which I think is about a smartwatch, which is a different topic.

381
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But that reminded me one other thing.

382
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:15,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you look at this if you haven't seen this yet.

383
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:18,323
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo Switch app got way better.

384
00:31:18,303 --> 00:31:39,214
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

385
00:31:39,194 --> 00:32:05,134
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

386
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely check that feature out if you haven't seen it.

387
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:13,285
[SPEAKER_01]: E3VL says, you can do stop charge at 90% in settings and save your battery long term.

388
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's another good feature to look for, that's for sure.

389
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bobby Blackwell says, you can see the pixelation in the sprites they use for the UI in Soul Calibur.

390
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:21,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you can.

391
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:26,642
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the bitmap versus vector, the equivalent of that in the game design, for sure.

392
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:31,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And F0GX cutscenes look rough.

393
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:31,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

394
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:31,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

395
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:37,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pokemon Scarlet cutscenes look rougher than the game now, which wasn't the case on Switch 1.

396
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:43,817
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they were rendered for the Switch 1 screen, which was a lower resolution, they don't look as good on the Switch.

397
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:45,621
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not bad, but you can tell.

398
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:50,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, it's a little pixelated, a little rough around the edges.

399
00:32:52,145 --> 00:33:10,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of neat.

400
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:14,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Night on VOG where we can all race each other since it's, you know, these huge races.

401
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:18,372
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do something before Southern Fried, which is in two weeks.

402
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:22,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta is in two weeks.

403
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,722
[SPEAKER_01]: So we won't be here live that night.

404
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:24,724
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the 22nd.

405
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:26,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually be flying...

406
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:31,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be at the Gaming Expo that morning, but I'm going right to the airport from the Expo to come home on Sunday.

407
00:33:31,652 --> 00:33:34,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be on an airplane by the time this show is on the air.

408
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will not be live in two weeks on Sunday.

409
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,542
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that Expo happens, we will do a Mario Kart night.

410
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:48,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to give you guys time to unlock things, get a little more used to it, because I have to be honest, I haven't played it a lot.

411
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:53,151
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm a little hesitant to share some of my opinions, because I fully admit they may still change.

412
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:56,053
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I explore a free world, maybe my thoughts will change.

413
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:03,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only cleared a few of the knockout and a few of the Grand Prix on 50cc to start the unlock process.

414
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:09,997
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we'll get to it maybe the end of this week or middle of next.

415
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm still leaving it wide open, but I want to check with Bobby and my own schedule and stuff and just see what lines up.

416
00:34:15,406 --> 00:34:31,896
[SPEAKER_01]: so more to come on that but if you want to join in on that which I hope you will please join our discord server over at vognetwork.com that's vognetwork.com slash discord that'll get you to our discord server and when that happens we will have all the info on discord in fact

417
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:50,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you connect to rooms and stuff, but if there's a code or something like that, it will be in the Discord to prevent randos on Twitch from joining, which I notice the more I've been streaming Pokemon Scarlet and that stuff again, people are like, oh, I'll get you a shiny so-and-so.

418
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:51,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me end the game.

419
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:52,785
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a shiny so-and-so.

420
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:55,808
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, bitch, I know that's hacked.

421
00:34:55,788 --> 00:35:06,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to interact with people I don't have at least a little bit of familiarity with because unfortunately some people on Twitch just want to Twitch bomb other users and, you know, whatever.

422
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:12,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will post any codes and things like that in our Discord server.

423
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:13,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

424
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

425
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:19,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked a lot about Switch too, but maybe there's some other things we want to talk about as well.

426
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, I will let you start.

427
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, I mean, there's so much.

428
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:27,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess, yeah, we could start with Sony real quick.

429
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,297
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, your gaming week.

430
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:30,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Your gaming week, Loki.

431
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gaming week.

432
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:31,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gosh.

433
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:39,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Mario Kart World and watching a lot of these different game events.

434
00:35:39,342 --> 00:35:51,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of Bellatro, a tiny bit of Minecraft actually because I've been still setting up like a mod pack for... I'm still setting up a mod pack for modded series.

435
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a balance between what features I want and not melting my CPU and GPU from...

436
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the mods running at once.

437
00:36:00,432 --> 00:36:17,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And it literally is, you know, I'm not exaggerating when I say not melting my CPU because I was getting up to 95 degrees Celsius on the CPU while it was processing, creating chunks with a bunch of mods running.

438
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's with like an AIO of like 100% too.

439
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:21,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like...

440
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, need to take that one out.

441
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.

442
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:34,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, hopefully I'll be working on new stuff very soon in Channel 64.

443
00:36:35,107 --> 00:36:51,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I'm at the point now where I have to start working on the Mega Game stuff, so it kind of slows everything down quite a bit, because I have to essentially do a lot of design work and planning behind the scenes before I can kind of

444
00:36:51,331 --> 00:37:00,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to the next step in my next episode, which would be making the external part of the the actual dungeon, I guess.

445
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:15,254
[SPEAKER_03]: But being that I don't know what the size of the dungeon is or what it's going to look like or how it's going to be laid out, I kind of have to figure all that stuff out first before I start putting stuff into the world because I don't know how much space I need to allocate for myself and everything.

446
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:19,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been doing like other like making

447
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:45,165
[SPEAKER_01]: you know quests and um just farms and stuff in between because at least that I can kill time with all right uh my gaming week outside of the Switch 2 I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 and last week on the show I talked about how I wasn't really enjoying the solo adventure on the new Crescent Island uh Occult Crescent the that whole content that they just patched in

448
00:37:45,145 --> 00:38:13,043
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

449
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:39,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing a lot of Fantasy Life.

450
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:59,112
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

451
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:06,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a fun game and something I will sink more time into around all these other games I need to be playing right now.

452
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good time to be gaming, though.

453
00:39:07,884 --> 00:39:09,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's just so much.

454
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:28,373
[SPEAKER_01]: The Switch 2 is really, despite the criticisms and feedback of things in particular about Mario Kart World, I still think it really is just energized a lot in a way that we needed energy in the industry because unfortunately there's still a shit ton of layoffs going on.

455
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:52,048
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

456
00:39:52,028 --> 00:40:10,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Outriders, thank you DJ Ranma S, that was the name of it.

457
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,099
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

458
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:12,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's our Gaming Weeks.

459
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:18,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Loki, we can try to tackle some of these announcements from the weekend.

460
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:20,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's start with Sony's State of Play.

461
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:24,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of came out first the day before the Switch launch.

462
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:28,118
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other interesting thing is they didn't give us any warning.

463
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:29,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the day before.

464
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The day before, they said, tune in tomorrow.

465
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:37,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And they gave us what you would expect to have been probably an E3 type of presentation.

466
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,872
[SPEAKER_01]: It had that many heavy-hitting games in it, right?

467
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:41,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely, yeah, would agree with that.

468
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was, yeah, quite a bit of stuff that was kind of exciting coming out of that.

469
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:54,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously for us, like right off the bat, we have Luminous Rise, which is essentially Tetris Effect, but Luminous.

470
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:55,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

471
00:40:55,445 --> 00:41:20,305
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already amazing.

472
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:46,140
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cheap now, I think.

473
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:49,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I do miss the licensed music.

474
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:58,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I do miss, there was a certain charm that Luminous 2, I almost said Shinen 2 because I was looking at Renmari's comment.

475
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:08,770
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain charm that Luminous 2 on the PSP had with all that silly licensed music in it that we were supposed to get on the 360 that never happened.

476
00:42:09,307 --> 00:42:17,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told this story before, but I remember at E3, I got to play Madonna in Luminous Xbox 360, which never happened.

477
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: They never released it.

478
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,568
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only ever at that E3 where you could play Sorry by Madonna in Luminous.

479
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:24,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what happened.

480
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Licensing disagreements or something.

481
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Rimari says, the pleasure of making colored squares to holla back, girl.

482
00:42:31,703 --> 00:42:34,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, there's something kind of charming about that whole thing.

483
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a great song list.

484
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,203
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good songs in it.

485
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:45,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will miss the licensed songs a little bit, but...

486
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:49,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know if there's no licensed songs on it?

487
00:42:49,293 --> 00:43:06,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we don't for sure, but the trailer had what was almost certainly the same creative minds, which I think is just Tetsuya Mizuguchi's group or something, but the same creative minds around I'm Yours Forever, which was the Tetris Effect song, almost certainly did that song that was in the Luminous trailer.

488
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:11,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't know for sure, but you know, that's a safe prediction for me.

489
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,136
[SPEAKER_01]: But Luminous Rise, really excited about it.

490
00:43:15,156 --> 00:43:16,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to play it.

491
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:18,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looked really good.

492
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:22,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We had another game, Pragmata, which looked interesting.

493
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:28,295
[SPEAKER_03]: It had this little girl and some AI robot thing.

494
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:31,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it was kind of sci-fi-ish sort of thing, right?

495
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:32,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was interesting.

496
00:43:33,343 --> 00:43:37,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I was getting Megan vibes from it, but not quite.

497
00:43:38,912 --> 00:43:39,353
[SPEAKER_03]: If only.

498
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:40,114
Yeah.

499
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:48,609
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Romeo is a Dead Man, which I immediately pegged the Suda51 grasshopper manufacturer vibes from.

500
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yep, yep, yeah, that's it.

501
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a hack and slash game, so it looks pretty cool.

502
00:43:54,799 --> 00:44:00,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an extended trailer for Silent Hill F, which is coming out September 25th.

503
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:03,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty good.

504
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:25,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloodstained the Scarlet Engagement so I guess a sequel to Bloodstained and it's going to be at least have two player co-op in it it looks pretty cool we have a Digimon Story Time Stranger I don't know I'm not a huge Digimon fan but it looks neat

505
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy Tactics, The Eyeless Chronicles.

506
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:34,511
[SPEAKER_01]: God, the worst kept rumor secret in the fucking industry, finally.

507
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:34,891
[SPEAKER_01]: We know.

508
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:46,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And Creative Business Unit 3, the Final Fantasy XIV team working on it, which is not too big of a shock when you consider that team is made up of a lot of the people that worked on the Evil East games to begin with.

509
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:49,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of folks there that worked on the original.

510
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:51,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Very curious to see what else they put in the enhanced version.

511
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have the enhanced version and the original version, right?

512
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I don't think we should expect anything from advanced or nothing outside of what was in vanilla.

513
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We should expect.

514
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:07,163
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will be curious what changes they might make to the difficulty, if any.

515
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:10,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Tactics was a fucking hard game.

516
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:12,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

517
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:14,635
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

518
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:22,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like other people.

519
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:22,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.

520
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:37,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

521
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:56,987
[SPEAKER_03]: and fine, but let other people you know, have the little tweaks that help them see the whole story I'll be curious if they rebalance stuff, for sure but I'm really excited this is coming Baby Steps got another trailer, that's the one from Developer Digital, it's kind of like QWOP as a walking sim, but you know, obviously

522
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,269
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be frustrating.

523
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,114
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out September 8th on PlayStation 5.

524
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:11,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Hirogami, which is a cool-looking origami paper-inspired RPG type thing.

525
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:12,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool aesthetic on that.

526
00:46:12,907 --> 00:46:15,991
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out on PlayStation 5 on September 3rd.

527
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:26,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, brand new entry into that, including they have some unlockable characters with Pac-Man they showed off in the trailer.

528
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:29,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gets excited about Pac-Man in golfing games?

529
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

530
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:31,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Not me.

531
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:33,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But September, coming out there.

532
00:46:34,279 --> 00:46:38,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Another trailer for Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, which I think we saw.

533
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:38,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that looked cool.

534
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:39,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

535
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:40,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

536
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:42,252
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd seen it before, but still.

537
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was either at the Game Awards or maybe at another PlayStation Direct or something.

538
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:50,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it looked really cool.

539
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:56,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Karen, which is a survival climbing experience.

540
00:46:56,795 --> 00:47:01,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember talking about this one before, but that's coming now on November 5th.

541
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:04,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a demo out for that.

542
00:47:04,427 --> 00:47:07,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.

543
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:08,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we got to talk about that.

544
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go do a deep dive on this one, but go ahead.

545
00:47:11,386 --> 00:47:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

546
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:34,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Would people be interested in that?

547
00:47:34,294 --> 00:47:41,904
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy a fight stick, wouldn't you rather get one that a lot of the other fighting game players use?

548
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:44,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, because I'm expecting this to be expensive.

549
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:47,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe, but that fight stick looked really good, Loki.

550
00:47:49,154 --> 00:47:51,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I kind of listen to that.

551
00:47:52,207 --> 00:48:07,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

552
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:30,060
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com.

553
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:50,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Digital Eclipse, Ninja Turtles, Gold Master Series

554
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:55,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby, our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who's live before we are on Sunday nights, the Voice Geeks Network.

555
00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:01,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby actually asked, so the head of Digital Eclipse is actually on Blue Sky and uses it.

556
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:09,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Mika is studio head for Digital Eclipse, Atari, and actually responded to a question Bobby asked that was basically like, what...

557
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,182
[SPEAKER_01]: What made... Okay, so you're saying... I'm paraphrasing.

558
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:21,601
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying this isn't a gold master game, but it looks like it has a lot of that same stuff that Atari 50 had, which kind of felt very... What is a gold master game and what is not a gold master game?

559
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:25,309
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm paraphrasing the answer here, but essentially, the...

560
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:31,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Collection are kind of a celebration of the game and they are game focused first.

561
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Game emulation and the game experience is first.

562
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:42,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have sort of like the catalog of the deeper dives of the documentary pieces and the game elements and that is second.

563
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold Master Series is the other way around.

564
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:54,537
[SPEAKER_01]: The narrative takes the spotlight and the documentary side of things, which you really see it in the Tetris collection that they did recently.

565
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:57,100
[SPEAKER_01]: You really see it in the Tetris one, in my opinion.

566
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:04,549
[SPEAKER_01]: How they weave in the games into that story they're telling about getting the rights and how Japan had their own version on their Famicom.

567
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,410
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one of those.

568
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:08,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes together with the story.

569
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:21,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I say that is because you might remember some time ago on this show, after we played the very first Gold Master Series game, Karateka, I said, the next one will probably be Mortal Kombat.

570
00:50:21,863 --> 00:50:28,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's an interview with, I think it was Tobias, was in that Karateka, and I was like...

571
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:31,526
[SPEAKER_01]: What he doesn't really have anything to do with Karateka.

572
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,832
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a short little clip in this.

573
00:50:33,852 --> 00:50:40,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were already filming him for something else and asked him to comment on Karateka because, you know, it was a fighting game.

574
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, Mortal Kombat, something's coming.

575
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:45,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, here we are.

576
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:50,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to be fair, I said it would be a gold master game and technically it's not, but I still want half a win.

577
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:53,319
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other funny interaction on Blue Sky.

578
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:58,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was writing a bunch of just fucking, you know, posts about what was going on with the Sony thing.

579
00:50:58,024 --> 00:51:01,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put one that said Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.

580
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:07,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I did say when one of the creators showed up in Karateka Gold Series, it was likely Mortal Kombat was next.

581
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:11,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's not technically a gold master, but it's getting the same TLC so close enough.

582
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Must buy for me.

583
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:21,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Mika, who by the way, at the time I didn't even follow, replies to my post and says, we saw your post.

584
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:46,553
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

585
00:51:46,533 --> 00:52:06,685
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know who's looking at stuff on social media.

586
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:14,134
[SPEAKER_01]: But let this be a note to all of you that the game developers and the people that work on this stuff are watching.

587
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:20,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you make your criticisms, which you have every right to do, keep that in mind in the back of your head.

588
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:23,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say this to the developer's face, yes or no?

589
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:24,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you probably are.

590
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:26,650
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be.

591
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was interesting.

592
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:33,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I love that he replied and I just replied, you slipped.

593
00:52:33,462 --> 00:52:34,223
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said that.

594
00:52:34,243 --> 00:52:35,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I said you slipped.

595
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:36,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kidding.

596
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:39,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you got, you know, the typical... And it's from the heart.

597
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:39,631
[SPEAKER_01]: It's honest.

598
00:52:40,372 --> 00:52:41,334
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing great stuff.

599
00:52:41,654 --> 00:52:43,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Love what you're doing for game preservation.

600
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:47,142
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever want to do a podcast when Mortal Kombat's coming out, please let me know.

601
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

602
00:52:51,028 --> 00:52:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100Matt says, Use your Rob Stradama's powers to get a Miyamoto Gold Master game before he retires.

603
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:59,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish, but that's a big ask.

604
00:52:59,701 --> 00:53:01,384
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big ask.

605
00:53:01,404 --> 00:53:02,305
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

606
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:08,167
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not going to say it's not plausible, your favorite, but anyway.

607
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:12,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

608
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:17,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Tigerclaw says, I still think it's going to include Deadly Alliance, Deception, and Armageddon, the console versions.

609
00:53:18,998 --> 00:53:19,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It might.

610
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:23,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess they're not done announcing what's in it, but I would be careful where you set the bar.

611
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,966
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be very careful where you set the bar.

612
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:27,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

613
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:29,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.

614
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:35,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think maybe some of the weird hacks and things that came out of the original Mortal Kombat and some of that maybe is what you'll see.

615
00:53:35,901 --> 00:53:39,307
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if we'll get full on other games.

616
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:42,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, could we get that whole Sub-Zero side story game on PlayStation 1?

617
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know if that fits in.

618
00:53:45,097 --> 00:54:11,222
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless the first four arcade games by themselves with the deeper dive that Digital Eclipse does I think it's going to be worthy of the collection and I'm not just saying that because now I know they might be listening I would have said this even without the blue sky interaction this week so but I did think I did find that humorous so all right that's all I wanted to say on the Mortal Kombat collection um but very happy for Digital Eclipse and very happy for Mortal Kombat it deserves it deserves this nice sort of um museum treatment

619
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:18,445
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll be watching for what cameos don't make sense in that either, just so you know yep

620
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:23,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We got yet another trailer for Melgar's Solid Delta Snake Eater.

621
00:54:25,568 --> 00:54:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: They teased also Melgar Online at the end with that as well.

622
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:38,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Nioh 3 is going to be getting its launch in 2026 and they have a demo out for that as well.

623
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:44,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Thief VR Legacy of Shadow coming to PlayStation VR 2.

624
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:50,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Tides of Tomorrow, I don't remember what that was.

625
00:54:50,926 --> 00:55:18,283
[SPEAKER_03]: but neat Astrobot getting some new levels so they've got some new challenge levels including special bots Atsu from Ghosts of Yotai and they also have five new levels which are going to be coming out later this month and they had another Astrobot DualSense controller or I don't know if they're bringing the old one back or if they changed it slightly but it's coming back one way or the other

626
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

627
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Anchors Away, which kind of look like Sea of Thieves, but not quite.

628
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:28,372
[SPEAKER_03]: But very Sea of Thieves-like.

629
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be coming next year.

630
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:50,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Sword of the Sea which looks pretty cool as well that's going to be coming out August 19th that's from the makers of Journey and Flower and certainly has that kind of same vibe with the whole sand surfing type stuff those games are some of the best games ever made so I'm really excited for this

631
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:53,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it looks really good.

632
00:55:53,956 --> 00:56:00,087
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the first look at 007 First Light, the new 007 game by IO Interactive.

633
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:03,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, it is James Bond.

634
00:56:05,135 --> 00:56:06,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That's next year as well.

635
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:14,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost of Yotai, which is... They had a new teaser for that.

636
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:15,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

637
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:33,613
[SPEAKER_03]: and then ending things off totally unexpected but I am super hyped about this game a brand new Marvel fighting game, Marvel Token Fighting Souls done by the folks, Arc System Works Marvel vs. Capcom minus Capcom plus Arc

638
00:56:34,538 --> 00:56:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus Japanese anime stylings and stuff.

639
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:42,347
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all in plus arc if you've played Guilty Gear.

640
00:56:42,748 --> 00:56:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very true, yes.

641
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,312
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am all about this.

642
00:56:46,492 --> 00:56:48,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks incredible.

643
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:50,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The roster already looks good.

644
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,119
[SPEAKER_03]: The character designs look amazing.

645
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:54,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about this.

646
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait.

647
00:56:55,322 --> 00:56:57,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's PlayStation 5 and PC next year.

648
00:56:57,505 --> 00:57:20,560
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

649
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:37,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom Auto Hookup for a fighting game is Sega

650
00:57:38,393 --> 00:57:39,975
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like, huh.

651
00:57:40,816 --> 00:57:41,697
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be interesting.

652
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,420
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be really interesting.

653
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:46,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that train of thought.

654
00:57:46,424 --> 00:57:49,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Who does Capcom shack up with now?

655
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:58,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was like, well that could be an interesting little like, could Capcom maybe be involved with the future of Smash?

656
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:05,031
[SPEAKER_01]: and what happens there because I don't know if Sakurai wants to necessarily do Smash anymore.

657
00:58:05,492 --> 00:58:10,220
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like how we've seen... But that doesn't mean there's not going to be another Smash game.

658
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:16,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sort of feel like how we're seeing some very different creative thoughts and processes go into Mario Kart World.

659
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:21,259
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see some different thoughts and processes go into...

660
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:21,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash.

661
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I ultimately don't think the Capcom thing is just mostly tongue-in-cheek.

662
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:26,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't think there's anything to that.

663
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:31,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that maybe creatively, there's going to be a lot of changes with the next Smash.

664
00:58:31,953 --> 00:58:35,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you want to play Smash the way you remember it, you have that game.

665
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:36,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is here.

666
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's the capstone to Smash, looking like that.

667
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:43,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see where it goes from here.

668
00:58:43,328 --> 00:59:11,344
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could be interesting if Capcom's like we want to give our input because some of our characters like Mega Man are in the game anyway so we'll see anyway anyways yes so like that trailer is amazing yeah I'm not even that into fighting games and that looked like wow this is I'm not that into Marvel either I respect both but I'm just not like but I was like oh I'll play that that was hot

669
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks really good.

670
00:59:14,606 --> 00:59:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a day one purchase for me, for sure.

671
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you feel about the Sony thing overall?

672
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:21,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty good.

673
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:27,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have any expectations for it when it came in, but certainly there was some nice surprises in there.

674
00:59:28,404 --> 00:59:29,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's all right.

675
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:30,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they did a really good job.

676
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:39,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially considering they're having to contend with a new console from one of their competitors launching the next day and Microsoft doing their own thing today.

677
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:41,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

678
00:59:42,668 --> 01:00:04,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

679
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:09,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And cheap plug, we did a live stream here at VOG Network on Friday, and that'll be in the archives for 14 days.

680
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:15,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we no longer keep archives beyond 14 days because Twitch capped us, as they did everybody.

681
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:18,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have about another week to watch if you want.

682
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:24,441
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand the show itself wasn't for everybody.

683
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:27,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like there's something in it for you.

684
01:00:28,122 --> 01:00:37,660
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

685
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:43,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so kind of going over how they announced stuff over there.

686
01:00:43,418 --> 01:00:51,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially, they made a big focus about dev team size, it felt like.

687
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:54,753
[SPEAKER_03]: They were talking about, you know, different indie games.

688
01:00:54,894 --> 01:01:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the top games on Steam right now included like several indies, including, you know, Repo, Claire Obscure, Expedition 33, Split Fiction, that type of stuff.

689
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:11,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to figure out, what was the endgame with those comments?

690
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:15,590
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the intention behind repeating that so much?

691
01:01:15,731 --> 01:01:22,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a veiled sort of poke at something like Ubisoft or the AAA games?

692
01:01:22,406 --> 01:01:24,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, yeah.

693
01:01:24,772 --> 01:01:49,125
[SPEAKER_01]: or was it more like a it's going to be okay game devs we've got all these small studios doing great things although there have been a lot of rightful points that have come out after the fact going okay so Clare Obscure was made by a team of 30 on paper but you have a lot of groups that do outsource work what about the voice actors what about the music what about you know and so when you look at the credits for a game there are more than 30 people in it

694
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

695
01:01:51,047 --> 01:02:13,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

696
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it may have also been just pushing to... He was also promoting GameDiscover.co as well, that site.

697
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about the game industry and stuff.

698
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:28,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

699
01:02:28,735 --> 01:02:36,831
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think maybe it was just like, hey, AAA industry, the way you guys are operating and everything...

700
01:02:37,115 --> 01:02:37,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not working.

701
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: You're putting out these games, but this cookie cutter stuff that you're doing, but these smaller games that are taking unique approaches to things or just listening to their fan base and putting out stuff that there's a hole in the market for it, they're doing well.

702
01:02:55,125 --> 01:03:03,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas Team Shooter number 457 that's released out on the marketplace...

703
01:03:03,862 --> 01:03:05,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not doing as well.

704
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:11,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think there's a message in there about how the way games are developed is going to really change.

705
01:03:12,518 --> 01:03:16,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And engines like Unreal 5 are kind of doing that.

706
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:20,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And for better or for worse, AI is going to be a part of this conversation as well.

707
01:03:20,953 --> 01:03:22,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be whether you like it or not.

708
01:03:22,736 --> 01:03:25,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly you all know I have my opinions on it.

709
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I like AI in tool-based situations.

710
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:32,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I dislike AI in trying to replace art with generative stuff type of situations.

711
01:03:32,712 --> 01:03:40,944
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, that Jurassic World 3 game has an AI warning on Steam that the little user avatars are generated by AI.

712
01:03:41,024 --> 01:03:41,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

713
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:42,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

714
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:44,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

715
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:45,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

716
01:03:45,703 --> 01:04:09,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

717
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:15,185
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes more like smaller groups working together as one large group.

718
01:04:15,746 --> 01:04:18,850
[SPEAKER_01]: But the advantage of that, I'm not saying I'm advocating for that.

719
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering out loud if that's where things are going.

720
01:04:21,894 --> 01:04:35,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I will say the one advantage I do see in that situation, you don't have the potential for as much fat sack CEOs to be sitting on the top of this and ruining everything.

721
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:39,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, just something interesting.

722
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:45,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, but yeah, game reveals, obviously, were the name of the game.

723
01:04:45,839 --> 01:05:03,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kicked things off with a trailer for Mortal Shell 2, which features one of the several genres that were in the Summer Game Fest presentation, which was a Dark Souls-like game that is bloody and creepy.

724
01:05:03,881 --> 01:05:08,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that definitely fit the bill for that.

725
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That is coming out next year.

726
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:16,477
[SPEAKER_03]: They also talked about some sort of, what was it, they had Death Stranding 2.

727
01:05:16,858 --> 01:05:20,783
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed off a new cutscene for that as well.

728
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:26,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I am getting kind of tired of seeing Death Stranding 2 at this point, but it does look good.

729
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:31,318
[SPEAKER_01]: It is getting to that point where it's like, enough, release the damn game.

730
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,643
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good news is, the damn game's being released in like two weeks, so yay.

731
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have a Chronicles Medieval trailer narrated by Tom Hardy, maybe, or at least someone that sounds like Tom Hardy.

733
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:48,749
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out on Steam in 2026.

734
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:50,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

735
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,294
[SPEAKER_03]: This one really was something I got excited about.

736
01:05:53,674 --> 01:05:55,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Sonic Racing Cross Worlds.

737
01:05:55,296 --> 01:06:00,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sonic Racing games have been always pretty good, and this time they have...

738
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:19,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

739
01:06:19,763 --> 01:06:45,687
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they unveiled because the game is called Cross Worlds that they're going to be essentially having characters from other franchises and levels in there and one of their first collaborations is with Minecraft so they're going to have Steve Alex and the Creeper as characters and a Minecraft actual level I heard the rumor that there is Spongebob is supposed to be another crossover that they're going to have

740
01:06:45,667 --> 01:07:07,793
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a bunch, yes.

741
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:30,422
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know and that's that's i could that's a hard one to make up and get right you know what i mean yeah i could see the nickelodeon thing because that makes sense because if you think about sonic the movie was produced by paramount paramount owns nickelodeon okay okay i can see that you know what else is on paramount plus rupaul's drag race

742
01:07:31,634 --> 01:08:00,190
[SPEAKER_01]: could we finally oh my god you have race you have race to the title that's right could we get RuPaul's Drag Race but it's actual racing oh my god please let Jujubee be one of the playable characters why not it's Jujubee again why not Jujubee and Ginger Minj should absolutely be in Sonic Crossworld Racing why not Crossdressing Racing yeah let's do it let's do it Crossdressing Racing

743
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:16,660
[SPEAKER_03]: uh Crossworld there you go that that sounds like a RuPaul Drag Race season right there like Crossworld I mean yeah they're gonna run out of twist ideas for all stars eventually so we might as well go to Cross Crossworld and there you go uh let's see

744
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:20,534
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a bunch of trailers.

745
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:24,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So Code Vein 2 had a reveal trailer.

746
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty awesome.

747
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:26,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out later this year.

748
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:37,753
[SPEAKER_03]: End of the Abyss, a top-down isometric-looking game, and that's by Epic Games as well as Section 9 Interactive.

749
01:08:37,733 --> 01:09:00,433
[SPEAKER_03]: and we had a new updated trailer for Mouse PI for Hire this is the one that looks like the old 1920s cartoons but it's an FPS and of course because he voices almost every character in the world when it comes to gaming Troy Baker is going to be doing the main character voice as well so

750
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:06,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of Thrones War of Westeros looks pretty awesome.

751
01:09:06,251 --> 01:09:10,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like a few years too late, but it looks neat.

752
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:14,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Atomic Heart 2, I'm actually pretty psyched for.

753
01:09:14,602 --> 01:09:17,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be a spiritual successor to the original game.

754
01:09:18,568 --> 01:09:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly kind of expands upon everything.

755
01:09:21,372 --> 01:09:26,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They are horny as fuck, though, when it comes to the content in that game.

756
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:32,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, tying with that, though, is also the cube in the Atomic Universe.

757
01:09:32,954 --> 01:09:33,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that MMO.

758
01:09:33,857 --> 01:09:35,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an MMORPG shooter.

759
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:40,392
[SPEAKER_01]: That rotating cube thing looked kind of neat, though, like as a concept about how the world could kind of, like, rotate and stuff.

760
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:41,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like the idea.

761
01:09:41,274 --> 01:09:42,537
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting concept, yeah.

762
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be coming out at some point.

763
01:09:47,403 --> 01:09:54,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got a brand new trailer for Marvel Cosmic Invasion by Tribute.

764
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks awesome.

765
01:09:56,253 --> 01:10:00,297
[SPEAKER_03]: They're adding Rocket Raccoon and She-Hulk joining the cast as well.

766
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly love everything Tribute does.

767
01:10:02,499 --> 01:10:03,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I love their beat-em-up games.

768
01:10:03,941 --> 01:10:04,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great.

769
01:10:05,082 --> 01:10:09,167
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the big X-Men 90s beat-em-up, Ninja Turtles arcade game, Simpsons arcade.

770
01:10:09,187 --> 01:10:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that same vibe.

771
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:13,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're into that, this is going to be for you for sure.

772
01:10:13,617 --> 01:10:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Onimusha, Way of the Sword looks pretty cool and that's going to be coming out next year I was really excited about this one because it's just such a unique idea but felt that boxing it's a boxing game with puppets

773
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:35,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like I'm watching The Muppet Show or something like that because it's so well executed.

774
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:36,242
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very X-rated, though.

775
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:37,383
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very X-rated.

776
01:10:37,423 --> 01:10:38,284
[SPEAKER_01]: They were cursing.

777
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:42,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was Meet the Feebles as the arcade game.

778
01:10:43,471 --> 01:10:46,134
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was one of the highlights of the whole damn thing for me.

779
01:10:46,494 --> 01:10:53,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm not sure what the game is because I gotta say the game kind of was starting to look like... Is this like a 3DO...

780
01:10:54,573 --> 01:11:06,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Like little mini game game because I just I really hope the game itself is better than that or it's really funny to make up for it because I wasn't I was like, what's the game here?

781
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I have concerns.

782
01:11:10,148 --> 01:11:11,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it looks funny.

783
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm willing to check it out when that is released.

784
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,696
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Killer Inn.

785
01:11:17,457 --> 01:11:19,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a murder mystery action game.

786
01:11:20,061 --> 01:11:21,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this looks really cool.

787
01:11:21,863 --> 01:11:32,596
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one that's like Among Us, but it's like Clue or Knives Out, but with like actual murder instead of like playing Clue, but like you full on are killing the other characters.

788
01:11:33,237 --> 01:11:36,742
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like implied or suggested or something like that.

789
01:11:36,762 --> 01:11:38,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 24 player game.

790
01:11:38,684 --> 01:11:39,886
[SPEAKER_01]: That looked fun.

791
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:45,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an email from Square Enix after for a beta test or something.

792
01:11:45,695 --> 01:11:47,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm not supposed to say that.

793
01:11:47,919 --> 01:11:49,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into that.

794
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:50,182
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check it out.

795
01:11:50,363 --> 01:11:55,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure all the Final Fantasy subscribers got one so that's why I'm yapping.

796
01:11:55,357 --> 01:11:57,421
[SPEAKER_03]: New trailer for Ark Raiders.

797
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their release trailer.

798
01:11:58,664 --> 01:12:00,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out October 30th.

799
01:12:01,169 --> 01:12:06,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently that's been doing pretty well in their early tests that they did earlier this year.

800
01:12:07,601 --> 01:12:10,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Dune Awakening got a new trailer as well.

801
01:12:10,848 --> 01:12:12,471
[SPEAKER_03]: That looked pretty good.

802
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:30,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Chrono Odyssey Not to be confused with Chrono Trigger or Cross Completely different And so that's going to be coming out on Steam The playtest is coming out in a few weeks We had M.I.O.

803
01:12:30,861 --> 01:12:35,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Memories in Orbit They announced a demo for that

804
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:59,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Outworlds looked pretty cool this one is done in the style of like stop motion and so it looks a little bit like a Coraline or something like that but I kind of got that whole split fiction or takes two vibes with that the controls look like VVVVV where you were like flipping gravity that's what the gameplay was looking like to me yeah yeah

805
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

806
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:03,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Mafia The Old Country.

807
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:06,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a new trailer for that that's coming out in August on the 8th.

808
01:13:08,386 --> 01:13:11,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I just never get into Mafia.

809
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:12,494
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense.

810
01:13:12,694 --> 01:13:14,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, you can't love everything.

811
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:15,861
[SPEAKER_01]: No disrespect.

812
01:13:16,061 --> 01:13:16,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

813
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:26,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We had LEGO Voyagers, which is kind of a... Also, once again, like a split fiction or something like that.

814
01:13:26,766 --> 01:13:28,108
[SPEAKER_01]: That looked really interesting.

815
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:33,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, little bricks and you kind of... The graphics were very shiny in that game.

816
01:13:33,516 --> 01:13:35,179
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked very crisp.

817
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very much like... I don't remember the last LEGO puzzle game that they had, but similar to that.

818
01:13:41,148 --> 01:13:45,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Unreal 5 makes everything look just amazing, so...

819
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:51,265
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do look like real physical, tangible bricks.

820
01:13:51,285 --> 01:13:52,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty cool.

821
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like a lot of fun.

822
01:13:54,712 --> 01:13:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicktoons and the Dice of Destiny.

823
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:00,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Nicktoons D&D-like adventure.

824
01:14:00,923 --> 01:14:03,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it had Diablo vibes to me.

825
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Nicktoons Diablo.

826
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that sounds like a lot of fun to me.

827
01:14:07,237 --> 01:14:11,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Some were thinking it was Baldur's Gate, Nickelodeon, which I think is also a great idea.

828
01:14:11,467 --> 01:14:14,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure exactly how it plays, if it's more actiony or more RPG-ish.

829
01:14:14,394 --> 01:14:16,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked actiony to me, but we'll see.

830
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:20,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks a little bit like Minecraft Dungeon-y, almost.

831
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:23,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So, curious to check that out.

832
01:14:24,463 --> 01:14:29,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Liza P. Overture, I believe that's, yeah, DLC that came out today!

833
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Drop, yeah.

834
01:14:31,253 --> 01:14:31,974
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple days ago.

835
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:34,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

836
01:14:35,159 --> 01:14:41,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Fractured Blooms, that was like a weird Silent Hill-looking type of game.

837
01:14:41,829 --> 01:14:42,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

838
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:48,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Blade and Soul Neo and Blade and Soul Heroes.

839
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:53,453
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's expansions to their ongoing MMOs.

840
01:14:54,515 --> 01:14:57,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course Jurassic World Evolution 3.

841
01:14:58,781 --> 01:15:03,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had Jeff Goldblum doing the voiceover on that.

842
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:06,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not really sure much.

843
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really played any of the Jurassic World games.

844
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:14,353
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave one of them away during, like, it was either an Epic Free Game of the Week or a PlayStation something.

845
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:17,737
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's honestly just been sitting in my backlog.

846
01:15:18,118 --> 01:15:20,702
[SPEAKER_01]: In concept, it sounds really good.

847
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:23,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little put off by...

848
01:15:23,847 --> 01:15:26,772
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole AI thing that apparently is in the third game.

849
01:15:26,932 --> 01:15:41,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to have more information to make an informed decision, but if they are just using generative AI to make art that looks silly, it's going to ruin the experience, sorry to say.

850
01:15:41,534 --> 01:15:47,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think they would have learned from... I can't even remember the game now.

851
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,428
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was Splatoon, but with bubbles.

852
01:15:51,775 --> 01:15:53,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Foam Stars.

853
01:15:53,077 --> 01:15:53,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Foam Stars.

854
01:15:53,538 --> 01:15:54,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
01:15:54,099 --> 01:15:54,860
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

856
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You think they would have learned from that?

857
01:15:56,723 --> 01:16:00,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that game honestly wasn't bad.

858
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:09,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But they really sucked the air out of the room by taking one shortcut, they really could have just not had album art.

859
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:10,527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy, anyway.

860
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:17,379
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Mina the Hollower, which is a new game from Yacht Club Games.

861
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked a lot like a Legend of Zelda type of game.

862
01:16:22,028 --> 01:16:23,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely had NES vibes.

863
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:28,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it had like NES or Game Boy Color vibes on that.

864
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be coming out October 31st.

865
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Deadpool VR.

866
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:36,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited about that, except I don't have a MetaQuest 3, so I can't really play that.

867
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:39,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Another VR game that got me excited, except it's the wrong VR.

868
01:16:40,544 --> 01:16:41,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

869
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:44,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil Patrick Harris is playing Wade Wilson, so that sounds awesome.

870
01:16:44,888 --> 01:16:45,709
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll look great.

871
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:47,270
[SPEAKER_01]: That trailer was very sharp.

872
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:47,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

873
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:49,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks cool.

874
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Dying Light is getting a spinoff game, Dying Light the Beast, and that is coming out August 22nd.

875
01:16:58,465 --> 01:17:04,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we had, uh, Living in the 90s, The Game, or Mixtape.

876
01:17:04,838 --> 01:17:06,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new game by Annapurna.

877
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Oh, God.

878
01:17:09,326 --> 01:17:10,689
[SPEAKER_01]: All those references.

879
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,793
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely made for people our age.

880
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:15,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna have to get it.

881
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:16,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

882
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:16,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately.

883
01:17:17,162 --> 01:17:17,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

884
01:17:17,888 --> 01:17:25,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had Toa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, or basically Buff Corgi Monk and Distinguished Fish.

885
01:17:25,987 --> 01:17:30,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that game looked cool, because that was also kind of a Diablo-y looking game, if I'm not mistaken.

886
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:35,830
[SPEAKER_01]: The character design was really neat, and then they were saying it was inspired by...

887
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:48,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to misattribute it, but it seems like there's more to it than just coming up with creative characters that is actually inspired by art and other things in the past history.

888
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:50,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very curious about that game.

889
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:51,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked neat.

890
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:57,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We had another game called Acts of Blood, which is like a beat-em-up game.

891
01:17:59,014 --> 01:18:00,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked kind of interesting.

892
01:18:01,717 --> 01:18:01,817
Yeah.

893
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:25,864
[SPEAKER_03]: but speaking of beat-em-up games though right after that they uh showed off a trailer for Scott Pilgrim EX yeah wow that was a very pleasant exciting yeah it's exciting as we got you know it's Anamona Gucci back with Tribute Games again uh a different story right a new story a brand new story four-player co-op uh I think it was like seven characters or something like that

894
01:18:25,844 --> 01:18:49,017
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

895
01:18:49,132 --> 01:18:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks awesome.

896
01:18:51,095 --> 01:18:55,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the first Descendants breakthrough.

897
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,426
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a trailer for that.

898
01:18:57,447 --> 01:18:59,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what this was.

899
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:05,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's some sort of mech-y combat thing.

900
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:10,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be confused with the Disney Descendants.

901
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:13,755
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely not related at all.

902
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:17,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say that's... Here's a deep cut here.

903
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:27,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the first Descendants has enough to do with the Descendants from Disney as did the Final Fantasy Legend of the... Was it Legend of the Crystals?

904
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: The movie had to do with Final Fantasy.

905
01:19:32,354 --> 01:19:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically how close those were.

906
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:58,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Scum, it's Rust Plus, essentially It's crass humor, the game Oh, that trailer was a hot mess, but yes There were butts in that trailer So that's how you know it's edgy There's so many butts Yet still not the edgiest thing that was at Summer Game Fest

907
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

908
01:20:18,265 --> 01:20:45,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitman, World of Assassins or Assassination we got the Madden Mickelson cameo or uh he's playing um Leigh Shreve I guess from Casino Royale because you know obviously IO Interactive is making the the Bond game so they're gonna obviously do some sort of Bond kind of tie in with that for a little bit so you can check that out now um and then the most obvious thing or um

909
01:20:46,497 --> 01:20:59,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Legally Distinct Mario Party Lego Party It's Mario Party but with Lego and on more than just Nintendo systems So that's coming out later this year It actually looks kind of fun

910
01:20:59,575 --> 01:21:02,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, then we've got, what was it?

911
01:21:02,182 --> 01:21:02,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild Gate.

912
01:21:03,144 --> 01:21:08,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was, I was ranting and I was muted, but, um, it, I was gonna say for Legally Distinct, it looked really good.

913
01:21:08,799 --> 01:21:12,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I'm kind of excited for Mario to get a little, little run for its money.

914
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:15,316
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the little competition will be good.

915
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:16,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Lego thing looked cool.

916
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:36,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Wildgate announced an open beta which is going to be actually out during Steam Next Fest which is launching on July 24th It's like a space warfare game Blighted, that's another roguelike game that's going to be out on Steam as well

917
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:48,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a thing called Ill, which is going back to the very first game we talked about in that gross, nasty, creepy-looking survivor horror game in Unreal 5.

918
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:51,690
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that looks kind of cool.

919
01:21:52,812 --> 01:21:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Mecha Break got yet another trailer.

920
01:21:55,596 --> 01:21:56,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

921
01:21:56,477 --> 01:21:58,439
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's coming out July 1st.

922
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I'm also starting to get tired of seeing Mecha Break as well.

923
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: and Infantessimals.

924
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:15,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very grounded looking game where you play little bug-like creatures and you fight in mechs and big bugs and stuff like that.

925
01:22:15,223 --> 01:22:15,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked kind of neat.

926
01:22:17,629 --> 01:22:20,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had the whole tease before the tease.

927
01:22:20,797 --> 01:22:24,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did this thing with the...

928
01:22:23,984 --> 01:22:52,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Resident Evil 30th Anniversary teaser and they talked about how like oh look we're doing this stuff and don't worry we'll talk about Resident Evil the next Resident Evil soon later on you know what the fuck was the point of that like what the fuck was the point of that I don't my my thought my honest reaction is that the ultimate Resident Evil announcement was a very late edition like they were going into that with like 50 50 yes or no we're gonna pull the trigger on this thing

929
01:22:52,402 --> 01:23:20,991
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think they may be left in the commercial anyway just because somebody thought it was funny at that point to keep it in but like maybe what was the point of that I don't understand I don't know it's just a trick people like I get I get the trolling element look it's not lost on me it's it's cute whatever but I just was like Capcom you spent money on that ad that was that was an interesting play but okay okay sure it's your money spend it how you want

930
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:27,210
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little LOL, but it was LOL in lowercase, where you weren't really laughing out loud.

931
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:30,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You were... You were just making a little breath.

932
01:23:30,134 --> 01:23:32,216
[SPEAKER_01]: You were making a snort.

933
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:33,298
[SPEAKER_01]: You snorted out loud.

934
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:34,099
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't laughing out loud.

935
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:38,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be GTM, guffaw to myself.

936
01:23:38,845 --> 01:23:40,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's it.

937
01:23:40,607 --> 01:23:41,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, perfect.

938
01:23:41,728 --> 01:23:43,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, perfect, perfect.

939
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:48,477
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not an LOL, it was a GTM.

940
01:23:48,597 --> 01:23:49,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm LOLing.

941
01:23:50,485 --> 01:24:16,189
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

942
01:24:16,169 --> 01:24:21,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or Mortal Kombat, I guess.

943
01:24:21,115 --> 01:24:23,818
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of, yeah.

944
01:24:23,838 --> 01:24:36,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got Last Flag, which is supposed to be like a 1970s retro team shooter capture the flag game, which I couldn't help but just think it looks exactly like Team Fortress 2.

945
01:24:36,913 --> 01:24:37,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, exactly.

946
01:24:38,034 --> 01:24:39,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the classes even.

947
01:24:39,136 --> 01:24:40,577
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a scout class even.

948
01:24:40,657 --> 01:24:41,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like...

949
01:24:42,292 --> 01:25:04,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Wuchang Fallen Feathers Rise of the Deceiver

950
01:25:05,073 --> 01:25:07,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Unexpected, but great.

951
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Co-op action RPG game.

952
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:10,379
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't show much of it though.

953
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little tease.

954
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:13,263
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

955
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we had another weird looking game, kind of had some Conker vibes on it, but Into the Unwell.

956
01:25:21,613 --> 01:25:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It sort of looked a little bit like Maus as well, but just kind of has that retro cartoon style to it, but also a little bit twisted and weird.

957
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:55,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got to the next announcement, which we had the dev for, I don't remember which studio, but he was promoting Splitgate 2, and it's that combat game with portals in it.

958
01:25:55,073 --> 01:26:00,043
[SPEAKER_03]: He came out with a stupid hat saying, make FPS great again.

959
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And said, I want Titanfall 3.

960
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:07,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And then proceeded to show a game that looked very bland and bog standard.

961
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:08,761
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

962
01:26:08,882 --> 01:26:10,585
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's getting a new Battle Royale mode.

963
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:11,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

964
01:26:11,226 --> 01:26:11,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Nailhead.

965
01:26:12,007 --> 01:26:16,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, you made a choice, young man, to come out there on stage and be edgy.

966
01:26:17,252 --> 01:26:27,463
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, I'm going to be edgy McEdgelord today, and I'm going to say these things so I either get invited back or I can pout that I don't get invited back next time.

967
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:33,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say these edgy, edgy things and talk about how fucking great this game is and how, you know, da-da-da.

968
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:40,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you prepare to roll the scissor wheel on a game we've seen a million fucking times with portals.

969
01:26:41,783 --> 01:26:44,146
[SPEAKER_01]: You made a choice, sir.

970
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:45,048
[SPEAKER_01]: You made a choice.

971
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:46,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.

972
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:48,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all these fucking dog whistles, too.

973
01:26:49,033 --> 01:26:50,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know exactly what I'm talking about.

974
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:51,537
[SPEAKER_01]: You know exactly what I'm talking about.

975
01:26:51,937 --> 01:26:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: All these fucking dog whistles and what he was saying, too, let alone the hat that he was wearing.

976
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:57,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I literally had to go, is this parody?

977
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:04,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a joke that is going on and what's happening here?

978
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:06,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Ranma says it was parodies.

979
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:07,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you listen to what he said, though?

980
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of what he was saying that was very coded.

981
01:27:10,744 --> 01:27:11,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they're always saying.

982
01:27:11,585 --> 01:27:13,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, here's the thing.

983
01:27:13,307 --> 01:27:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: You made a choice to turn off what could have been a crowd that maybe would have taken interest in your free-to-play game otherwise.

984
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:26,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're going all in on the other half, which, fine, maybe that'll work out for you.

985
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:30,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll help your free-to-play game get noticed, where a lot of them don't get noticed.

986
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:32,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll help get noticed.

987
01:27:32,152 --> 01:27:36,377
[SPEAKER_01]: But just remember, it's also the crowd of some of the...

988
01:27:36,644 --> 01:27:58,838
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

989
01:27:59,206 --> 01:28:06,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to bring up the whole parody argument because we hear that a lot nowadays, especially in, or like, I was just joking, I was trolling.

990
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, we hear that a lot even in the political landscape when someone says something controversial or something to the point it's like, no human should be saying that type of thing.

991
01:28:17,942 --> 01:28:18,042
Look,

992
01:28:18,241 --> 01:28:27,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, when you have the attention of millions of people in a press thing like this, and you're going to make a joke, you better make damn sure it's funny.

993
01:28:27,475 --> 01:28:28,297
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

994
01:28:28,597 --> 01:28:29,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

995
01:28:29,298 --> 01:28:33,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if you're joking or doing a parody.

996
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:35,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you have to do that in the first place?

997
01:28:35,408 --> 01:28:38,032
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a show where you showcase your game.

998
01:28:38,272 --> 01:28:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to go, look at me, I'm a character.

999
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:45,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who you are, and I am literally not going to be thinking about you ever again.

1000
01:28:45,764 --> 01:28:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from the stupid things that you did.

1001
01:28:47,927 --> 01:28:53,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, why, like, why take the focus off of your game?

1002
01:28:53,717 --> 01:28:56,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why not talk about what makes your game different?

1003
01:28:56,701 --> 01:28:58,244
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes your game special?

1004
01:28:58,384 --> 01:28:59,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should I check out your game?

1005
01:29:01,088 --> 01:29:07,899
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think my favorite comment, though, and I don't remember who, somewhere on social media I saw where they compared it.

1006
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, he's a pizza cutter.

1007
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,767
[SPEAKER_03]: All edge, no point.

1008
01:29:13,777 --> 01:29:18,106
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, no further discussion on that game is going to be on this program.

1009
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:18,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move on.

1010
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:23,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do, and yeah, to Ranma's point on chat, he got the spotlight on his company to get people to talk.

1011
01:29:23,637 --> 01:29:23,978
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked.

1012
01:29:24,138 --> 01:29:24,519
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

1013
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,343
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't be giving this any more exposure.

1014
01:29:26,363 --> 01:29:26,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Next.

1015
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:31,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same studio.

1016
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:48,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same studio, yeah.

1017
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,323
[SPEAKER_03]: So, looks great.

1018
01:29:53,085 --> 01:30:10,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, oh my god, shock, because they told us, wait, you told us you weren't going to discuss this game, and then, boom, Resident Evil Requiem, Resident Evil 9, it's coming out February 27th, unless it gets delayed, because, you know, games be doing that.

1019
01:30:10,911 --> 01:30:12,133
[SPEAKER_01]: But the trailer did look good.

1020
01:30:12,113 --> 01:30:19,004
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a minute to figure out what it was, and then you saw the ruined Raccoon City Police Department.

1021
01:30:19,044 --> 01:30:20,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, this is Resident Evil.

1022
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:23,511
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was it.

1023
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:24,893
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot.

1024
01:30:25,174 --> 01:30:26,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they crammed a lot into two hours.

1025
01:30:27,918 --> 01:30:29,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

1026
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I kind of look back on the things that I was into, and there was...

1027
01:30:33,764 --> 01:30:56,717
[SPEAKER_01]: XBOX did their showcase!

1028
01:30:57,608 --> 01:30:59,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a lot of things shown off.

1029
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:05,758
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big ones, obviously, is The Outer Worlds 2, which is coming out October 29th.

1030
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks pretty great.

1031
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:19,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to also, they're going to be, since the launch is going to be, I don't know, it's day and date on PlayStation 5 as well.

1032
01:31:20,236 --> 01:31:23,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also their first $80 game.

1033
01:31:24,963 --> 01:31:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll take that as well.

1034
01:31:26,465 --> 01:31:27,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty good, though.

1035
01:31:29,389 --> 01:31:31,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But is $8 good?

1036
01:31:31,191 --> 01:31:31,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1037
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1038
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:32,693
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1039
01:31:33,634 --> 01:31:36,378
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a trailer for Haya on Life 2.

1040
01:31:37,419 --> 01:31:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely a little bit more sci-fi.

1041
01:31:40,784 --> 01:31:43,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Your character, of course, was like skateboarding around in this one.

1042
01:31:44,328 --> 01:31:45,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks really cool.

1043
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:50,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that will be coming out sometime in the near future.

1044
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:58,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Resonance A Plague Tale Legacy They revealed that, that's coming out next year

1045
01:31:59,506 --> 01:32:01,609
[SPEAKER_03]: and... what else?

1046
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:08,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got the announcement of the ROG Xbox Ally and... Ally!

1047
01:32:09,662 --> 01:32:12,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's... Just in time for Pride Month.

1048
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:13,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Ally!

1049
01:32:13,188 --> 01:32:16,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Portable PC, you know, like a Steam Deck type thing.

1050
01:32:17,034 --> 01:32:19,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the ROG Ally's been a thing for a while now.

1051
01:32:19,898 --> 01:32:21,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they're doing one that's Xbox-branded.

1052
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:24,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally that leak we talked about two weeks ago was it.

1053
01:32:24,886 --> 01:32:26,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we got confirmation.

1054
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:27,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1055
01:32:28,295 --> 01:32:41,477
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's no price is announced yet but it's getting powered by why would they announce a price but aren't you supposed to announce a price Loki why would you not announce a price

1056
01:32:42,014 --> 01:32:42,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1057
01:32:43,096 --> 01:32:45,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see what it's going to be.

1058
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:52,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty big competitive space right now with all the different Steam decks and stuff.

1059
01:32:52,649 --> 01:32:53,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a neat idea.

1060
01:32:53,931 --> 01:32:58,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I have room for another handheld, but it's not like I don't support Microsoft in other ways.

1061
01:32:58,738 --> 01:33:00,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this will be neat for a certain audience.

1062
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:16,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just a PC, so what's great about it, though, and one of the things that they, you know, touted, I mean, which is true for any PC, but it's like, hey, you know, you can play your Xbox games out here, but you're not just limited to that, you know, you also can get stuff from Steam, you can get stuff from good old games and all that stuff, which is like...

1063
01:33:17,502 --> 01:33:19,746
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run your emulators from desktop.

1064
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,028
[SPEAKER_03]: You can run your emulators.

1065
01:33:21,068 --> 01:33:23,973
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play Nintendo Switch games on this thing.

1066
01:33:24,013 --> 01:33:28,842
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download PlayStation games because they're on PC as well.

1067
01:33:30,184 --> 01:33:32,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see that ad.

1068
01:33:32,528 --> 01:33:35,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox just says fuck it to the legal stuff.

1069
01:33:35,794 --> 01:33:38,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, obviously that's not happening.

1070
01:33:38,748 --> 01:33:42,074
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Blood of the Dawnwalker.

1071
01:33:42,435 --> 01:33:45,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another RPG game.

1072
01:33:45,601 --> 01:33:50,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done by XCD Project Red Devs who formed the Rebel Wolves.

1073
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:52,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks kind of cool.

1074
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:55,538
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, uh, this one looked really neat.

1075
01:33:55,798 --> 01:33:58,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Super Meat Boy 3D.

1076
01:33:58,683 --> 01:34:02,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're doing a sequel, but it is, you know, it's a 3D platformer now.

1077
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:06,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Still all the same Meat Boy stuff, you know, lots of blood, lots of saws.

1078
01:34:07,218 --> 01:34:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard as hell, for sure.

1079
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:10,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, uh, looks cool.

1080
01:34:10,964 --> 01:34:13,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait to see speedruns on that.

1081
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:15,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Ninja Gaiden 4 got a new trailer.

1082
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:20,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be coming out here in the near future as well.

1083
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:22,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from the Ninja Gaiden game at Sony.

1084
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:24,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sony's was the retro flared one.

1085
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,059
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the retro one.

1086
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:27,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the modern take on Ninja Gaiden.

1087
01:34:27,301 --> 01:34:27,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1088
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:28,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1089
01:34:28,802 --> 01:34:33,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got the announcement of story DLC coming to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

1090
01:34:33,487 --> 01:34:38,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Order of the Giants, which is coming out September 4th.

1091
01:34:38,952 --> 01:34:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And that looks pretty awesome.

1092
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see we've got Beast Reincarnation which is by Game Freak and it's a Souls-like game that's coming out next year it's kind of interesting

1093
01:34:56,474 --> 01:35:26,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Clockwork Revolution Grounded 2 Honey, I Shrunk the Kids Again

1094
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:28,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey, it blew up the kids.

1095
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

1096
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:32,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

1097
01:35:32,172 --> 01:35:33,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Honey, we shrunk ourselves.

1098
01:35:33,733 --> 01:35:35,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1099
01:35:35,395 --> 01:35:35,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1100
01:35:35,515 --> 01:35:36,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1101
01:35:36,476 --> 01:35:38,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, looks cool.

1102
01:35:38,298 --> 01:35:40,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got new bugs and stuff in that.

1103
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be hitting early access July 29th.

1104
01:35:44,063 --> 01:35:45,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That's soon.

1105
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:49,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, I guess, I felt like Grounded was still being worked on.

1106
01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:53,032
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be fair, I played that like a little bit when it was first on Game Pass, then never again.

1107
01:35:53,112 --> 01:35:55,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, it's a cute game.

1108
01:35:55,154 --> 01:35:56,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be curious about it.

1109
01:35:56,870 --> 01:36:04,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Blooper Team is back with a new horror game, Kronos the New Dawn, which is going to be arriving next year.

1110
01:36:05,605 --> 01:36:07,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a space horror game.

1111
01:36:07,449 --> 01:36:08,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks kind of cool.

1112
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're having a good year with Silent Hill.

1113
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:16,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know a lot of their stuff hit kind of mediocre, but the Silent Hill 2 remake hit all the right notes, so.

1114
01:36:17,086 --> 01:36:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an announcement of another expansion to Elder Scrolls Online with Elder Scrolls Online Seasons of the Worm Cult Part 1 which is going to be launching in about a week.

1115
01:36:30,133 --> 01:36:31,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And no more Elder Scrolls for you.

1116
01:36:32,518 --> 01:36:34,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stay tuned for next year.

1117
01:36:34,282 --> 01:36:45,614
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, very important correction from DJ Ranma S in chat, our Rick Moranis expert, clearly, who says, I blew up The Kid was the second movie, and We Shrunk Ourselves was the third film.

1118
01:36:46,154 --> 01:36:50,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a whole Honey, We Shrunk the Universe.

1119
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:56,785
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole... I'm almost positive there was a fourth film at some point, too, that Rick Moranis had nothing to do with.

1120
01:36:57,426 --> 01:36:58,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1121
01:36:58,801 --> 01:37:00,505
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they're up to like five.

1122
01:37:01,067 --> 01:37:01,388
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1123
01:37:01,709 --> 01:37:02,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm joking.

1124
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a universe of those movies.

1125
01:37:04,436 --> 01:37:05,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1126
01:37:05,438 --> 01:37:08,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's like five Home Alone movies at this point, right?

1127
01:37:08,767 --> 01:37:10,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't count.

1128
01:37:11,354 --> 01:37:11,895
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1129
01:37:11,915 --> 01:37:13,439
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a TV series.

1130
01:37:13,459 --> 01:37:14,903
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.

1131
01:37:15,068 --> 01:37:16,950
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a TV series they had for that whole thing.

1132
01:37:17,912 --> 01:37:24,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and then there was the, oh, I'm well aware of the Disney ride, Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which was terrible.

1133
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I was terrible.

1134
01:37:25,742 --> 01:37:26,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1135
01:37:27,123 --> 01:37:28,966
[SPEAKER_01]: It was neat.

1136
01:37:29,526 --> 01:37:32,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody agrees with my hot takes sometimes, and that's fine.

1137
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:36,435
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's something you want to ride, I'll be in queue for Space Mountain again.

1138
01:37:39,233 --> 01:37:43,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if I am with Captain Neo, Captain Neo was way better, way better.

1139
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:44,560
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

1140
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, yes.

1141
01:37:47,844 --> 01:37:50,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it was the cutting edge thing with the shrug.

1142
01:37:50,968 --> 01:37:56,035
[SPEAKER_03]: The audience was like, we're going to blow air at you and like we're going to make a little rat tail spin around.

1143
01:37:56,095 --> 01:37:58,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So it feels like rats are running underneath your seat.

1144
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was silly, but.

1145
01:38:01,137 --> 01:38:05,144
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, on that note, RIP Muppet Vision 3D, officially.

1146
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:14,441
[SPEAKER_01]: The Disney California Adventure one closed years ago, but the Disney World attraction finally officially closed this last week.

1147
01:38:14,802 --> 01:38:17,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they making Avatar out of that, too?

1148
01:38:17,647 --> 01:38:17,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1149
01:38:17,948 --> 01:38:18,970
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being turned into something else.

1150
01:38:19,511 --> 01:38:21,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Muppet will be relocated to the Aerosmith, right?

1151
01:38:21,975 --> 01:38:24,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Aerosmith is being evicted from Disneyland, which, you know...

1152
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:30,748
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are going to make that rock and roller coaster, the Doctor Mayhem ride, which will be badass.

1153
01:38:30,788 --> 01:38:33,652
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm excited about, but RIP to Honey, I Shrunk the Audience.

1154
01:38:35,935 --> 01:38:37,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1155
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: They even had a game called, was that Felion?

1156
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:45,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a narrative-driven sci-fi adventure game by DotNod.

1157
01:38:45,227 --> 01:38:51,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminded me of like a Tomb Raider, but in space on a desolate planet.

1158
01:38:52,897 --> 01:38:52,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1159
01:38:53,686 --> 01:38:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever this space person is, it is their very bad day.

1160
01:38:58,111 --> 01:38:59,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.

1161
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:00,033
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of space games.

1162
01:39:01,215 --> 01:39:01,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1163
01:39:02,496 --> 01:39:08,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a weird looking game called There Are No Ghosts at the Grand.

1164
01:39:09,524 --> 01:39:15,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like some thing where you are an interior decorator who also hunts ghosts.

1165
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:16,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a cozy sim thing.

1166
01:39:17,153 --> 01:39:19,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And you vacuum up ghosts just like Luigi.

1167
01:39:19,176 --> 01:39:20,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So, kind of neat.

1168
01:39:21,739 --> 01:39:22,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1169
01:39:23,302 --> 01:39:29,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Age of Mythology Retold is getting a Heavenly Sphere.

1170
01:39:29,789 --> 01:39:35,136
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Japanese pantheon to the game.

1171
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:40,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That era is now coming with 12 new mission campaigns.

1172
01:39:41,463 --> 01:39:42,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 12 mission campaigns.

1173
01:39:43,605 --> 01:39:43,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

1174
01:39:45,307 --> 01:39:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

1175
01:39:46,509 --> 01:39:50,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Mundang Two Hearts, which looks just like Splinter Cell.

1176
01:39:50,733 --> 01:39:52,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be...

1177
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:57,202
[SPEAKER_03]: using Unreal 5 and no word on when that's coming out.

1178
01:39:58,946 --> 01:40:05,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Planet of Lana 2 looks gorgeous with the little kitty thing.

1179
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a cat, but it looks like a cat.

1180
01:40:07,926 --> 01:40:09,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a 2D cinematic game.

1181
01:40:11,632 --> 01:40:16,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Fallout 76 getting a fishing DLC.

1182
01:40:16,027 --> 01:40:18,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of surprised they're still cranking out stuff for Fallout 76.

1183
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's probably making money.

1184
01:40:21,364 --> 01:40:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Gone Fission.

1185
01:40:22,087 --> 01:40:24,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know people that play it.

1186
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:25,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the pun, yeah.

1187
01:40:25,922 --> 01:40:28,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So fishing, you get fishing rods and fishing in the game.

1188
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:30,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't eat those fish.

1189
01:40:30,873 --> 01:40:33,679
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that TV show probably brought more people to it, too.

1190
01:40:33,839 --> 01:40:35,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, you know.

1191
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:42,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Fallout 76 has also been given away for free a few times.

1192
01:40:42,679 --> 01:40:45,064
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of another one of those games that had a comeback story.

1193
01:40:46,090 --> 01:41:10,545
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah uh we have uh let's see solo leveling um they have Arise Overlord or Overdrive so they're showing that off and that's going to be an action RPG I think co-op RPG and that's coming later this year on PC and Xbox or I'm sorry later this year on PC Xbox next year um

1194
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:17,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have Animo, which is like, it looks like a Pal World type game, but it's not.

1195
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:20,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another one, another game.

1196
01:41:20,394 --> 01:41:22,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Even more legally distinct, yeah.

1197
01:41:22,617 --> 01:41:29,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but you, yes, but you, like, it looks like you transform into the animals and actually directly control them, which is kind of neat.

1198
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:31,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1199
01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:33,394
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they get, that's how they make it legally distinct.

1200
01:41:33,965 --> 01:41:35,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1201
01:41:35,367 --> 01:41:41,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got another look at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, which is out July 11th, but they put out a demo for it.

1202
01:41:41,939 --> 01:41:43,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I saw something on Game Pass today.

1203
01:41:44,904 --> 01:41:45,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1204
01:41:46,046 --> 01:41:55,122
[SPEAKER_03]: At Fate's End is a 2D game from the Spiritfarer team and looks like a really cool art style with that.

1205
01:41:56,224 --> 01:41:58,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be probably out later this year.

1206
01:41:59,395 --> 01:42:03,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War Reloaded showed off some gameplay.

1207
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:12,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly looks like Gears of War and they're going to be launching the pre-release beta later this week, I think, actually on the 13th.

1208
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:17,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check that out as well very soon.

1209
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Persona 4 Revival is finally revealed.

1210
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of teased that off a bit and looks gorgeous.

1211
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:29,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking forward to seeing how that does.

1212
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: More DLC for Sea of Thieves.

1213
01:42:32,974 --> 01:42:35,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe it or not, it's season 17.

1214
01:42:35,277 --> 01:42:39,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now they're adding smugglers and Tide.

1215
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:48,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually have, you know, they're making an emphasis on explosions and you're able to salvage for new weapons.

1216
01:42:49,095 --> 01:42:52,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it is, you know, of course, now multi-platform.

1217
01:42:52,179 --> 01:42:53,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a thing, too.

1218
01:42:55,243 --> 01:42:57,887
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those where the...

1219
01:42:58,222 --> 01:43:04,689
[SPEAKER_03]: The cinematic cutscene looked incredible, and then when they showed the game, I was like, eh, alright, I guess.

1220
01:43:04,709 --> 01:43:10,615
[SPEAKER_03]: But Invincible is getting a game, so Invincible Versus, it's a fighting game, three on three.

1221
01:43:11,717 --> 01:43:22,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I had high hopes, really high hopes for it when they were actually showing off the story cutscene stuff, because it looked straight out of the actual show and everything, but...

1222
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:40,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrate Xbox One

1223
01:43:40,038 --> 01:43:41,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe very soon.

1224
01:43:41,559 --> 01:43:47,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they also announced that Final Fantasy 16 is shadow dropping for today.

1225
01:43:48,185 --> 01:43:49,206
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the sales.

1226
01:43:49,226 --> 01:43:51,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Please pick up this game right now.

1227
01:43:51,528 --> 01:43:52,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1228
01:43:52,229 --> 01:43:53,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So buy it.

1229
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:53,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy now.

1230
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:54,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Consume.

1231
01:43:56,392 --> 01:44:09,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeper, which is a weird looking game where you are playing like a living lighthouse and I don't really know what you do with that, but you are a lighthouse creature and it's coming out October 17th.

1232
01:44:10,835 --> 01:44:11,776
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

1233
01:44:13,398 --> 01:44:18,866
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Phil Spencer teasing that there's also going to be more stuff coming later on.

1234
01:44:18,946 --> 01:44:20,648
[SPEAKER_03]: More announcements.

1235
01:44:21,209 --> 01:44:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: They said there's a new Forza game coming as well as some stuff with a return of a classic game.

1236
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:32,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a new Halo game or something like that.

1237
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1238
01:44:33,886 --> 01:44:47,710
[SPEAKER_03]: and last but not least they showed off a really neat looking sci-fi thing with like robots and stuff and then at the very end it was revealed to be Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and I was like oh never mind I'm not excited anymore

1239
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:53,140
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an interesting... It has the guy from Heroes in it, right?

1240
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:56,004
[SPEAKER_01]: He had an interesting teaser, too, about next year.

1241
01:44:56,164 --> 01:45:00,229
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, there'll be a new Forza next year, Fables next year.

1242
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:01,591
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one other one.

1243
01:45:01,611 --> 01:45:05,876
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said something about... And then we're coming back to one of our 25-year-old games where it all began.

1244
01:45:05,977 --> 01:45:10,322
[SPEAKER_01]: All but confirming these rumors that Halo Combat Evolved is getting yet another...

1245
01:45:10,302 --> 01:45:19,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Redo, because if you think about it, Master Chief Collection was a redo, but it's going to get yet another one that'll be out, which also kind of makes sense because Halo's kind of due for a new game, right?

1246
01:45:20,419 --> 01:45:22,643
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would make a lot of sense for next year.

1247
01:45:22,963 --> 01:45:25,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Halo Infinite didn't work out, did it?

1248
01:45:25,467 --> 01:45:25,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1249
01:45:25,928 --> 01:45:33,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was interesting that he kind of teased like laid up 2026's calendar too, which you don't usually see game companies do, which I thought was very interesting.

1250
01:45:33,908 --> 01:45:36,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still like more opportunity than out some of that stuff.

1251
01:45:36,335 --> 01:45:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do that closer towards the end of the year during game awards or like even...

1252
01:45:41,588 --> 01:45:47,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's going to be a lot being done at Gamescom or anything like that, but yeah, maybe.

1253
01:45:47,355 --> 01:45:50,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Gears of War was the other thing he had mentioned for 2086, something in that.

1254
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:58,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, but that was, yeah, so the Microsoft thing, I didn't get to watch it live, but it seems like it was fine.

1255
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:03,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think the sort of thing where like maybe there was some stuff in it for you, but maybe a lot of it wasn't.

1256
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:07,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what, you know, game companies have to kind of try to appeal to everybody, right?

1257
01:46:08,022 --> 01:46:08,943
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be tricky sometimes.

1258
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:10,465
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1259
01:46:10,445 --> 01:46:21,636
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1260
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:31,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Missed opportunity to maybe drip feed a couple more games into the retro classics that just came out a couple weeks ago and has not had any new games added to it yet.

1261
01:46:31,535 --> 01:46:34,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it would be a weekly cadence like AntStream.

1262
01:46:34,059 --> 01:46:35,822
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears not to be.

1263
01:46:36,402 --> 01:46:40,228
[SPEAKER_01]: The notifications are still not working on my system on PC.

1264
01:46:40,288 --> 01:46:42,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they work on an actual Series X. I don't know.

1265
01:46:42,551 --> 01:46:48,320
[SPEAKER_01]: But a little surprise that that one is already starting to wither away a little bit.

1266
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:50,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that they will...

1267
01:46:50,523 --> 01:47:16,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Put some attention on that as well in the coming weeks Alright, well, that was a lot of announcements So we had Switch 2 releases, Xbox, State of Play, Summer Game Fest But there were a lot of smaller announcements that happened too Loki, I don't know if there's anything that caught your eye I don't want to necessarily recap the 20 other shows that happened this week But were there anything you want to bring up?

1268
01:47:17,287 --> 01:47:46,197
[SPEAKER_03]: not a whole lot I know there was the Day of the Devs but they kind of covered some of the same games that some of the other ones did so like Mixtape was shown, Big Walk Marvel Cosmic Invasion that type of stuff so I don't really know if there was anything there that was interesting I did look into the Devolver Digital thing I didn't see their showcase at all but there's a game called Ball Pit

1269
01:47:46,733 --> 01:47:55,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ball X Pit, and it's a roguelike game that kind of has a mechanic... It's... I don't remember the name now.

1270
01:47:55,232 --> 01:48:01,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was, like, it's like Wizorb or something like that that was on the Xbox 360 that was kind of like a...

1271
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:09,392
[SPEAKER_03]: RPG, but it had the Arkanoid type breakout mechanics with the balls bouncing around and stuff like that.

1272
01:48:10,093 --> 01:48:12,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to that, but there's no brick breaking in this.

1273
01:48:13,037 --> 01:48:22,731
[SPEAKER_03]: But you basically fire balls and they bounce off the walls and it does damage against the enemies and you get different balls that enhance your attack and stuff like that.

1274
01:48:22,771 --> 01:48:23,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looked kind of cool.

1275
01:48:24,394 --> 01:48:26,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that's coming out a little bit later on.

1276
01:48:27,699 --> 01:48:27,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1277
01:48:29,225 --> 01:48:29,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

1278
01:48:29,946 --> 01:48:31,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really noticed any other stuff.

1279
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of thing, even with E3, back when that was a thing, is that there's just a lot.

1280
01:48:37,281 --> 01:48:40,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to visit every booth and play every game, right?

1281
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:41,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

1282
01:48:41,530 --> 01:48:50,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to keep track of everything, so certainly Steam Next Fest will be a nice way to check some of these things out.

1283
01:48:50,588 --> 01:48:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went through when I saw a lot of these and kind of wishlisted a bunch of stuff so I don't forget about it.

1284
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:00,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also like wait and see when stuff goes on sale.

1285
01:49:00,208 --> 01:49:02,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Avowed just went on sale for 25% off.

1286
01:49:02,894 --> 01:49:05,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll look into that.

1287
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:06,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know.

1288
01:49:06,642 --> 01:49:08,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I may play it on Xbox Free.

1289
01:49:08,426 --> 01:49:08,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Pass it.

1290
01:49:09,869 --> 01:49:10,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well...

1291
01:49:11,227 --> 01:49:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, unfortunately, like my other game consoles, my kids are monopolizing them.

1292
01:49:17,797 --> 01:49:24,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So my son is playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for like the third or fourth time now playing through that again.

1293
01:49:24,428 --> 01:49:26,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's doing that.

1294
01:49:26,531 --> 01:49:31,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess PC Game Pass.

1295
01:49:31,479 --> 01:49:32,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do that.

1296
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:32,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1297
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:32,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm complaining.

1298
01:49:34,303 --> 01:49:34,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

1299
01:49:34,884 --> 01:49:36,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it being through Steam, though.

1300
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:37,789
Okay.

1301
01:49:37,809 --> 01:49:37,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1302
01:49:38,009 --> 01:49:38,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1303
01:49:38,817 --> 01:49:39,258
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1304
01:49:39,278 --> 01:49:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?

1305
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:45,991
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty more weeks in the year, and there'll be plenty more news to come and follow-ups, and we'll stay on top of it best we can here at OLR.

1306
01:49:46,632 --> 01:49:49,277
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were expecting Nintendo to make announcements.

1307
01:49:49,337 --> 01:49:49,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

1308
01:49:49,998 --> 01:49:51,120
[SPEAKER_01]: They launched a console this week.

1309
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:55,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they're going to... I mean, they could do something next week.

1310
01:49:55,529 --> 01:49:57,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I just... I wouldn't hedge my bets there.

1311
01:49:57,693 --> 01:49:58,935
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess...

1312
01:49:58,915 --> 01:50:07,724
[SPEAKER_01]: If Nintendo does summer announcements, they'll be in July because they're going to want to remind people that that Donkey Kong game is coming out and to pick it up and all the cool features happening with that.

1313
01:50:07,764 --> 01:50:09,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll definitely be some sort of deep dive with that.

1314
01:50:10,006 --> 01:50:14,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe a Nintendo Direct to go with that, that maybe will date some of the holiday releases.

1315
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:16,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think they want to date the holiday releases.

1316
01:50:16,553 --> 01:50:24,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there will be something in the coming months, but I would put my money on July around the time the Donkey Kong game releases is probably a safer bet.

1317
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:24,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1318
01:50:24,481 --> 01:50:24,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1319
01:50:25,883 --> 01:50:26,283
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1320
01:50:26,944 --> 01:50:29,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into the classic game of the week.

1321
01:50:29,287 --> 01:50:31,070
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura isn't here.

1322
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:32,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means one of us gets to pick.

1323
01:50:32,452 --> 01:50:33,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided to pick tonight, Loki.

1324
01:50:33,974 --> 01:50:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have fun with this.

1325
01:50:35,436 --> 01:50:41,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to have fun with this segment tonight because you're going to laugh when you hear what I picked because I did not pick a game because it was a good game.

1326
01:50:42,005 --> 01:50:43,106
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm going to say about it.

1327
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:46,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's roll the bumper, shall we?

1328
01:50:56,408 --> 01:51:24,407
[SPEAKER_01]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week okay and reminder DarkSakura is not here tonight so I get to pick instead and the game I decided to pick you know it's E3 week and you know what would have been E3 week historically but it's no more and we have all these other things instead but I thought you know what let's go back

1329
01:51:24,387 --> 01:51:27,436
[SPEAKER_01]: to a real E3 moment with our classic game choice tonight.

1330
01:51:27,456 --> 01:51:31,246
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, tonight's classic game is Genji Days of the Blade.

1331
01:51:31,346 --> 01:51:32,770
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the game that I have picked tonight.

1332
01:51:33,693 --> 01:51:38,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Genji Days of the Blade was a game that was published by Sony Computer Entertainment.

1333
01:51:38,627 --> 01:51:39,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a direct...

1334
01:51:39,389 --> 01:51:41,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Game for the PlayStation 3.

1335
01:51:42,034 --> 01:51:45,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released under the newly rebranded Japan Studio.

1336
01:51:45,961 --> 01:51:47,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, Japan Studio was around forever.

1337
01:51:48,326 --> 01:51:50,750
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess they had rebranded for the PlayStation 3 or whatever.

1338
01:51:50,991 --> 01:51:52,614
[SPEAKER_01]: They're no longer around.

1339
01:51:53,436 --> 01:51:57,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of their folks are on Team Asobi now, which of course makes Astro Bot.

1340
01:51:58,345 --> 01:52:01,110
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very much not Astro Bot.

1341
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:16,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based off of historically accurate things.

1342
01:52:16,666 --> 01:52:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

1343
01:52:42,451 --> 01:52:44,521
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a battle with a giant enemy crab.

1344
01:52:45,103 --> 01:52:45,666
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1345
01:52:46,048 --> 01:52:49,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Genji Days of the Blade is the giant enemy crab game.

1346
01:52:49,443 --> 01:52:50,689
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this game.

1347
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:55,436
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this game, you know, it's essentially this game at the end of the day.

1348
01:52:55,496 --> 01:52:56,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to Onimusha.

1349
01:52:57,359 --> 01:52:59,503
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, you know, Sony's take on that whole thing.

1350
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But it did, I mean, the last game did pretty well.

1351
01:53:01,546 --> 01:53:06,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only reason this game didn't do well was probably because of what happened at E3.

1352
01:53:07,396 --> 01:53:10,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise it looks like a pretty competent fighter game.

1353
01:53:11,063 --> 01:53:14,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I've maybe played it once and that might be being generous.

1354
01:53:14,529 --> 01:53:16,592
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's be real, for a game of its era...

1355
01:53:16,572 --> 01:53:37,602
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1356
01:53:37,582 --> 01:53:45,216
[SPEAKER_01]: The game did get an award though from IGN, Best Artistic Design for the PlayStation 3 in 2006.

1357
01:53:45,256 --> 01:53:49,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the real legacy of this game is the giant enemy crab meme.

1358
01:53:50,386 --> 01:53:54,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Producer Bill Rich, I'm so sorry Bill.

1359
01:53:54,153 --> 01:54:11,048
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1360
01:54:11,028 --> 01:54:31,551
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's real time weapon change the power of the PlayStation 3 although in all seriousness I mean the PlayStation 3 a lot of the content being on the hard drive which wasn't a thing that was on the PS2 or PS1 actually having that stuff without loading times actually was somewhat of a technical you know it's not like it never occurred in PlayStation 2 games but

1361
01:54:31,531 --> 01:55:01,470
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to switch things in and out that fast was something that games having installation footprints to the hard drive on the PlayStation 3 would allow it just wasn't articulated in that particular way so yikes you know the official US PlayStation magazine scored this game 4.5 out of 10 when your own propaganda machine can't even give your game a good review it doesn't look that bad there were worse games on the PlayStation 3 but

1362
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:03,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there it is.

1363
01:55:04,011 --> 01:55:05,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the classic game of the week.

1364
01:55:05,693 --> 01:55:07,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know, but here's the thing.

1365
01:55:07,296 --> 01:55:11,401
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, she doesn't always pick great legendary games.

1366
01:55:11,902 --> 01:55:23,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes she's picking a game because of its history, and that's why I have picked this game as well, is its footprint that it left on the memes and the giant enemy crab.

1367
01:55:23,257 --> 01:55:24,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Genji, Days of the Blade.

1368
01:55:24,779 --> 01:55:26,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy your classic game of the week.

1369
01:55:28,544 --> 01:55:29,145
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1370
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:36,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, we've covered a lot of the news, so I think now we just need to get maybe some of these quick hitting things again.

1371
01:55:36,608 --> 01:55:38,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do some rapid fire news, Loki.

1372
01:55:39,352 --> 01:55:44,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we got some news regarding the PlayStation Plus Classic catalog.

1373
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:47,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe this was during the PlayStation Showcase thing.

1374
01:55:47,766 --> 01:55:59,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially that they're going to be adding Deus Ex on June 17th, Twisted Metal 3 and 4 on July 15th, and Resident Evil 2 and 3 later this summer as well.

1375
01:55:59,646 --> 01:56:02,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So look forward to those.

1376
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:12,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, uh, we've got news that the Switch 2 is selling out, but they are expected or they believe that they can meet the demand through the holiday.

1377
01:56:14,106 --> 01:56:18,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I'm curious to wonder how, how the tariff situation is going to go.

1378
01:56:18,332 --> 01:56:19,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the unknown.

1379
01:56:19,794 --> 01:56:21,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Between now and then, there's a lot of days.

1380
01:56:22,177 --> 01:56:25,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, Japan hasn't been like kind of, um,

1381
01:56:25,522 --> 01:56:47,057
[SPEAKER_01]: and the crosshairs with that but you never know I will say this I think we need to give credit where credit is due for all the shit we've given Nintendo about hardware launches in the past and rightfully so I think they got this one pretty good it does seem like if you tried to get a Switch 2 and correct me in chat if I'm wrong but if you tried to get a Switch 2 you got one

1382
01:56:47,037 --> 01:56:55,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'm wrong, but there were a bunch of people that walked up at Best Buy at midnight and still walked away with one, and there were more on the shelf the next day.

1383
01:56:56,110 --> 01:57:04,562
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is because they never said that Costco was going to be a retailer for Switch 2, that Costco probably still has these on shelves.

1384
01:57:04,582 --> 01:57:07,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're in bundles, but the bundle's not bad.

1385
01:57:07,546 --> 01:57:16,318
[SPEAKER_01]: The bundle is a, because you buy things in bulk at Costco, but it's a Switch, it's Mario Kart, and it's a year of Nintendo Online.

1386
01:57:16,298 --> 01:57:40,365
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1387
01:57:41,088 --> 01:57:57,612
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1388
01:57:57,592 --> 01:58:00,277
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Ranma S says, also, we're in an endemic state.

1389
01:58:00,557 --> 01:58:02,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Products are plentiful now.

1390
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:08,130
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use that excuse with how the NES Classic and the SNES Classic and so many things before went, though.

1391
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:15,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo doesn't usually nail hardware, or it's been a long time since I remember Nintendo nailing a hardware launch.

1392
01:58:15,122 --> 01:58:17,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So this seemed to go pretty darn well.

1393
01:58:17,746 --> 01:58:20,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give him credit for that.

1394
01:58:20,711 --> 01:58:21,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1395
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:25,825
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's talk about some other headlines in rapid-fire news.

1396
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:38,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the Switch 2, there are some unannounced improvements to old Switch games, maybe because they didn't get a new patch, but due to the nature of the hardware, the emulation, they are running slightly differently in a good way.

1397
01:58:38,861 --> 01:58:40,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean by that, Smash Bros.

1398
01:58:41,023 --> 01:58:44,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimate, improved loading speeds, but you'd expect that, right?

1399
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:48,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Bayonetta 3 is now running at 60 frames a second.

1400
01:58:48,520 --> 01:59:15,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Batman Arkham Knight is running at a steady 30 frames a second Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity now has an uncapped frame rate so it runs like really good on Switch too Witcher 3 is running a steady 30 frames a second it's so wild to think that it wasn't running that smooth before but it was the OJ Switch we're talking about Pokemon Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl improved loading speeds and Animal Crossing New Horizons also improved loading speeds so generally

1401
01:59:15,706 --> 01:59:38,035
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1402
01:59:38,015 --> 01:59:39,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was interesting.

1403
01:59:40,178 --> 01:59:42,782
[SPEAKER_01]: A prototype of Duke Nukem D-Day.

1404
01:59:43,142 --> 01:59:48,149
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a Duke Nukem game from Rockstar that was in development in the early 2000s.

1405
01:59:48,630 --> 01:59:50,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now leaked to the internet.

1406
01:59:50,493 --> 01:59:53,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be released in 2001.

1407
01:59:53,897 --> 01:59:57,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockstar was supposed to publish it, but it didn't end up happening.

1408
01:59:58,324 --> 02:00:01,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of Duke Nukem things, it ended up getting screwed.

1409
02:00:03,911 --> 02:00:06,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, though, this

1410
02:00:06,415 --> 02:00:34,363
[SPEAKER_01]: a build of the game was found apparently Apogee and 3D Realms founder Scott Miller had an industry insider friend who found a build of the game or covered one and a screenshot of the game made its way out and it was never publicly shared but now it's been publicly shared and if you want to go to archive.org you can find it and check out Duke Nukem D-Day for yourself but do remember it was a prototype so you can expect it's going to be a little bit buggy so but it's probably better than Duke Nukem Forever

1411
02:00:35,272 --> 02:01:04,772
[SPEAKER_03]: uh probably I don't know all right let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games coming out real soon um I know we're slowing down a little bit after last week but there's still still a little energy going this week right still some things yeah yeah we still got a few things so we've got uh this week of course Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion on PlayStation 4 PlayStation 5 Dune Awakening on PC Mind's Eye on PC PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series

1412

[SPEAKER_03]: StarTrucker on PlayStation 5, Warhammer 40k Space Marine Master Crafted Edition on PC and Xbox Series, Stellar Blade on PC, Forgotlings on PC, Virtual Girl at World's End on PC and Nintendo Switch,

1413
02:01:25,981 --> 02:01:46,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Wizard of Legend 2 coming out of early access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series The Altars on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series And finally, Five Nights at Freddy's Secret of the Mimic on PC and PlayStation 5 Nice

1414
02:01:47,041 --> 02:01:48,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's go to Japan.

1415
02:01:48,683 --> 02:01:55,210
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing on the Switch 2 this week, because I have to work that in my releases now, because obviously we had the big blitz last week.

1416
02:01:55,270 --> 02:02:02,859
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have some releases on the OG Switch still, and of course these games play on Switch 2, including we have the Irem Collection Volume 3.

1417
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:09,066
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes Mr. Heli, as in helicopter or battle chopper, depending on the part of the world you were in.

1418
02:02:09,086 --> 02:02:09,767
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is in it.

1419
02:02:09,847 --> 02:02:14,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Mystic Riders and Dragon Breed are all a part of this collection.

1420
02:02:14,152 --> 02:02:16,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's on the OG Switch, but, you know, it

1421
02:02:16,555 --> 02:02:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtual Girl at World's End, also on the Switch in Japan this week.

1422
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:25,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Asande Chess is also out on the Switch this week.

1423
02:02:25,723 --> 02:02:30,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that's it for the Switch in Japan.

1424
02:02:30,428 --> 02:02:32,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look at the PlayStation 5, though.

1425
02:02:34,572 --> 02:02:39,316
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are... Oh, that same Irem collection is out on the PlayStation 5, but that's it.

1426
02:02:39,376 --> 02:02:40,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty quiet week in Japan otherwise.

1427
02:02:41,158 --> 02:02:42,018
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the UK?

1428
02:02:42,038 --> 02:02:43,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have that, Loki?

1429
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:44,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1430
02:02:44,922 --> 02:02:50,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the UK, we've got Mind's Eye on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.

1431
02:02:51,209 --> 02:02:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Stellar Blade on PC.

1432
02:02:53,911 --> 02:02:59,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Wizard of Legend 2, also coming out of early access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

1433
02:02:59,838 --> 02:03:04,362

1435
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:15,352
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1436
02:03:16,664 --> 02:03:21,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of games to add to your backlog this week, but not a ton, thankfully.

1437
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:24,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a little room to breathe and actually play all those games you bought for your Switch 2 last week.

1438
02:03:25,095 --> 02:03:26,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, wrong shot there.

1439
02:03:26,097 --> 02:03:29,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's move on to our listener roundtable.

1440
02:03:29,922 --> 02:03:36,311
[SPEAKER_01]: We invite you guys to ask us questions in our Twitch chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, but we also welcome your emails.

1441
02:03:36,331 --> 02:03:40,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Participate at orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send your emails.

1442
02:03:40,216 --> 02:03:41,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I should check Blue Sky as well.

1443
02:03:41,538 --> 02:03:44,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember seeing anything, but I will take a peek.

1444
02:03:44,542 --> 02:03:49,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to make sure, because I missed one last week, unfortunately, so I don't want to miss anything this week.

1445
02:03:51,810 --> 02:03:53,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let me read this, because I missed it last week.

1446
02:03:53,612 --> 02:03:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkTetsuya had made a post to us on Blue Sky saying, Just a quick note, thanking all the folks for the support this week.

1447
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:04,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a medical emergency fall into our laps, so thanks everyone in the OLR VOG crew for their support.

1448
02:04:04,724 --> 02:04:08,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm glad to see Mish is doing great and is in our chat tonight, I believe.

1449
02:04:08,248 --> 02:04:12,473
[SPEAKER_01]: So hello, Mish, and hope your recovery is going swimmingly from all of that.

1450
02:04:12,453 --> 02:04:13,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some emails tonight.

1451
02:04:14,015 --> 02:04:15,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe it or not, two emails tonight.

1452
02:04:16,038 --> 02:04:17,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Participate at Orange Launch Radio.

1453
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:21,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both from people we don't hear from very often, which I love the emailers email us all the time.

1454
02:04:22,166 --> 02:04:24,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I love hearing from people we don't hear from very often.

1455
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get to the email bag.

1456
02:04:25,972 --> 02:04:27,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1457
02:04:28,215 --> 02:04:30,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first email tonight from Bryguy2365.

1458
02:04:30,758 --> 02:04:37,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Bryguy2365, who sent us an email and the subject was called...

1459
02:04:37,107 --> 02:04:40,030
[SPEAKER_01]: How an old fart plays Fortnite Mobile.

1460
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:42,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember this discussion last week, Loki?

1461
02:04:42,613 --> 02:04:49,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about Fortnite Mobile and I was like, but I'm so old, I don't understand how this works.

1462
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:50,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

1463
02:04:50,701 --> 02:04:51,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that?

1464
02:04:51,882 --> 02:04:54,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with on-screen controls.

1465
02:04:54,185 --> 02:04:58,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, here's... So we got this email and I'm gonna... It even has, like, photo evidence and everything.

1466
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna get into this here.

1467
02:04:59,911 --> 02:05:00,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1468
02:05:00,612 --> 02:05:01,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR friends.

1469
02:05:02,033 --> 02:05:03,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Bryguy2365 here.

1470
02:05:03,795 --> 02:05:04,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week...

1471
02:05:05,272 --> 02:05:08,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

1472
02:05:08,439 --> 02:05:21,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1473
02:05:21,927 --> 02:05:50,955
[SPEAKER_01]: well played I forgot about these controller attachments that you can put on your phone because it is a little weird that Apple doesn't have like at least as far as I know like an official official like first party controller like all these are supported through third parties to my knowledge and I don't you know again and then in the the Google verse there's kind of multiple phone makers anyway but yeah the minute I saw the picture which I'm showing for folks on Twitch uh I was like oh which by the way that's a fancy like gold is that like a gold

1474
02:05:51,644 --> 02:06:14,547
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.

1475
02:06:14,527 --> 02:06:32,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Death Star Event

1476
02:06:32,228 --> 02:06:54,810
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1477
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:57,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get out of the house, which doesn't always happen.

1478
02:06:57,433 --> 02:06:59,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get out of the house and I'm going to go do raids downtown.

1479
02:06:59,875 --> 02:07:02,838
[SPEAKER_01]: There were Gigantamax raids today in Pokemon.

1480
02:07:02,858 --> 02:07:04,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and I threw Campfire.

1481
02:07:05,681 --> 02:07:07,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the local group and I was like, you know what?

1482
02:07:08,003 --> 02:07:08,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Screw it.

1483
02:07:08,504 --> 02:07:09,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go and check it out.

1484
02:07:09,925 --> 02:07:13,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a decent, there was maybe like 12 people walking around.

1485
02:07:13,349 --> 02:07:16,252
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of all the remote people that raided in, we had to ease it.

1486
02:07:16,272 --> 02:07:17,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We took everything down super easy.

1487
02:07:18,574 --> 02:07:21,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got three Gigantamax Cinder Aces.

1488
02:07:21,537 --> 02:07:47,055
[SPEAKER_01]: none of them above a two-star appraisal which is sort of irritating but oh well what can you do all right uh let's go to the next email because I said we had two emails tonight our next email oh dang it I closed the tab that had it um Loki do you have something to buy me time while such as a last minute story while I pull up the email again because I foolishly closed it

1489
02:07:47,812 --> 02:07:49,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's see.

1490
02:07:49,354 --> 02:07:52,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were talking about Super Smash Bros.

1491
02:07:52,378 --> 02:07:55,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate on Switch 2 and how there's some enhancements.

1492
02:07:55,943 --> 02:07:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also some downsides to some of that.

1493
02:07:58,105 --> 02:08:02,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's some issues if you're playing against someone on Switch 1 and they have a Mii Fighter.

1494
02:08:03,613 --> 02:08:04,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of breaks the game.

1495
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:09,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And so be careful of that because it will kick you out of your game if you try to do that.

1496
02:08:10,021 --> 02:08:12,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yep.

1497
02:08:12,985 --> 02:08:16,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I recovered the email.

1498
02:08:16,069 --> 02:08:16,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.

1499
02:08:17,073 --> 02:08:41,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

1500
02:08:41,744 --> 02:08:58,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

1501
02:08:58,113 --> 02:09:00,216
[SPEAKER_01]: The honest answer to that is no.

1502
02:09:00,657 --> 02:09:04,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I very rarely go back and look at older episodes.

1503
02:09:04,303 --> 02:09:05,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this.

1504
02:09:05,444 --> 02:09:06,987
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been very interesting.

1505
02:09:07,648 --> 02:09:22,230
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our folks on Discord, who I've brought up on the show before, 13xForever, built this script that scrubbed all of our old shows from the OL Archive and basically did these transcriptions.

1506
02:09:22,868 --> 02:09:43,155
[SPEAKER_01]: and although you know I always say about the old shows they are relics of the past and of their time and not all of them have aged well and I think you always need to keep that in the back of your mind if you're gonna go you know because there is if you wanted to listen to just about every episode of OLR that ever existed I think there's only maybe two that are gone forever from the live only days and

1507
02:09:43,135 --> 02:10:00,655
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1508
02:10:00,635 --> 02:10:04,442
[SPEAKER_01]: is this whole, you know, and I say this very tongue in cheek.

1509
02:10:04,462 --> 02:10:07,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very humble about this, but sometimes it is really funny.

1510
02:10:07,607 --> 02:10:14,981
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole Rob Stradamus trend where I said something on the show and then, you know, years later it becomes a thing.

1511
02:10:15,001 --> 02:10:22,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the biggest example that I can think of was when the Nintendo Music app happened and I was like, what episode did I talk about that in?

1512
02:10:22,454 --> 02:10:51,162
[SPEAKER_01]: and because you can search the transcripts now was able to find what episode I talked about it in so I could put that old clip on up on YouTube and go I am smart and you know and this happened also recently with I don't know something else where I was like didn't I talk about that oh it was the um it was this the Mortal Kombat thing I was like what episode did I talk about that in that came up and then you know well well actually you said it would be a gold master game and it's not a gold master game show you were wrong but

1513
02:10:51,563 --> 02:11:00,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it was also, I think, when we were trying to figure out who coined the phrase TTP first.

1514
02:11:02,143 --> 02:11:04,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, you were trying to figure out the time to penis thing.

1515
02:11:04,828 --> 02:11:05,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1516
02:11:05,489 --> 02:11:06,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1517
02:11:06,672 --> 02:11:08,315
[SPEAKER_01]: You found out you weren't first.

1518
02:11:09,477 --> 02:11:12,222
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it was...

1519
02:11:12,826 --> 02:11:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Spore is like someone I think may have mentioned it around Spore or something.

1520
02:11:17,754 --> 02:11:17,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.

1521
02:11:18,134 --> 02:11:18,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1522
02:11:18,996 --> 02:11:19,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1523
02:11:19,837 --> 02:11:20,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back to the email.

1524
02:11:21,139 --> 02:11:27,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting how the older episodes have come in clutch for doing research and that sort of thing.

1525
02:11:28,611 --> 02:11:33,238
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I barely listen to the new shows.

1526
02:11:33,258 --> 02:11:34,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here now.

1527
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:35,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing it now.

1528
02:11:36,103 --> 02:11:38,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's from my perspective.

1529
02:11:38,767 --> 02:11:38,867
Yeah.

1530
02:11:39,337 --> 02:11:45,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm living it, so I don't often... But I will go back with the critical ear sometimes and be like, oh, how did that come across?

1531
02:11:45,143 --> 02:11:45,703
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that sound?

1532
02:11:45,723 --> 02:11:46,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be better?

1533
02:11:46,644 --> 02:11:51,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once in a while, but I also try not to overthink it and just let it be because we are live.

1534
02:11:52,710 --> 02:12:01,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's rare, but of course, once in a while, I'll come across an old clip or something on YouTube or something.

1535
02:12:01,619 --> 02:12:03,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, oh, that's kind of interesting.

1536
02:12:03,661 --> 02:12:04,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway...

1537
02:12:05,172 --> 02:12:22,725
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1538
02:12:22,705 --> 02:12:30,800
[SPEAKER_01]: We got together live and we listened to episode one with our commentary over the very first episode.

1539
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:31,942
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this a couple years ago.

1540
02:12:31,962 --> 02:12:33,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was like three or four at this point.

1541
02:12:33,425 --> 02:12:34,407
[SPEAKER_01]: This was during COVID, I think.

1542
02:12:34,828 --> 02:12:38,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We listened to our 19th anniversary show, which, yeah, would have been 2021.

1543
02:12:39,116 --> 02:12:39,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1544
02:12:39,397 --> 02:12:41,841
[SPEAKER_01]: We listened to our first show with commentary.

1545
02:12:41,861 --> 02:12:43,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one is still there.

1546
02:12:43,785 --> 02:12:44,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of those...

1547
02:12:45,790 --> 02:12:48,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, it was deleted.

1548
02:12:49,094 --> 02:12:50,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sucks.

1549
02:12:50,757 --> 02:12:51,337
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bummer.

1550
02:12:51,818 --> 02:12:52,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame you, Bobby.

1551
02:12:52,659 --> 02:12:53,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame Twitch.

1552
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:54,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.

1553
02:12:54,682 --> 02:12:55,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So never mind.

1554
02:12:58,066 --> 02:12:58,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, never mind.

1555
02:12:58,927 --> 02:13:00,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say anything about that.

1556
02:13:01,551 --> 02:13:03,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what that means?

1557
02:13:03,113 --> 02:13:05,195
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to do it again sometime.

1558
02:13:05,316 --> 02:13:07,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Not episode one, but maybe episode 100.

1559
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:12,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, if there's a night that DarkSakura isn't here, we need to go back and listen to episode 69.

1560
02:13:12,805 --> 02:13:13,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1561
02:13:14,461 --> 02:13:18,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Only because I say that because DarkSakura wasn't there for the actual.

1562
02:13:18,767 --> 02:13:22,473
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when Karaoke Revolution was played live on air.

1563
02:13:22,493 --> 02:13:29,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the notorious... That was the notorious Loki doing... I don't want to do that.

1564
02:13:29,744 --> 02:13:34,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to even like... I didn't want to even do that.

1565
02:13:34,371 --> 02:13:36,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So I restrainly changed the lyrics.

1566
02:13:37,175 --> 02:13:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, anyway.

1567
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:41,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also one of those things that didn't age well either.

1568
02:13:41,842 --> 02:13:43,725
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it didn't age well with time, but...

1569
02:13:44,313 --> 02:13:45,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I was right there, Loki.

1570
02:13:45,588 --> 02:13:46,458
[SPEAKER_01]: You had permission.

1571
02:13:47,206 --> 02:13:47,510
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1572
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:47,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1573
02:13:49,173 --> 02:13:49,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.

1574
02:13:51,675 --> 02:13:53,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have given myself permission.

1575
02:13:53,277 --> 02:13:58,561
[SPEAKER_01]: This email isn't really going anywhere to make at least some content out of it.

1576
02:13:59,042 --> 02:14:06,308
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years or console generations do you think Rockstar will get out of Grand Theft Auto 6 when it finally arrives?

1577
02:14:07,029 --> 02:14:08,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a million.

1578
02:14:08,751 --> 02:14:09,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1579
02:14:09,271 --> 02:14:19,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that might be their last single player GTA and they'll push towards GTA Online and expansions and versions thereof since it's such a cash cow?

1580
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:40,662
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I think that they were originally talking about doing that back with 5 with online was supposed to be like that too like they were going to have different cities and stuff I think what they're going to realize much like with everybody like EA has already figured this out that like hey, yeah we could keep expanding this one thing

1581
02:14:40,912 --> 02:14:45,479
[SPEAKER_03]: But then that means, you know, if we put out a new game, you gotta buy all that stuff again.

1582
02:14:45,640 --> 02:14:50,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, we'd rather you buy it again for a second time or third time or fourth time.

1583
02:14:50,848 --> 02:14:51,830
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that type of stuff.

1584
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why they will never just make one giant...

1585
02:14:57,365 --> 02:15:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

1586
02:15:19,538 --> 02:15:28,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're paying for all this server space and stuff to run all this, and it's just not making us the infinite amount of money that we want to.

1587
02:15:29,294 --> 02:15:34,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'd be cool if they had one giant universe, but I don't want to see how that's monetized.

1588
02:15:34,602 --> 02:15:36,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I gotta pay for my flight to Liberty City.

1589
02:15:36,906 --> 02:15:40,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be $4 million because everything's inflated in that game.

1590
02:15:41,613 --> 02:15:41,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1591
02:15:42,695 --> 02:15:42,795
Yeah.

1592
02:15:43,788 --> 02:15:44,129
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1593
02:15:45,010 --> 02:15:47,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you'll be rammed with Switch 2 release news this week.

1594
02:15:48,054 --> 02:15:49,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

1595
02:15:49,076 --> 02:15:51,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish you all the best and look forward to future shows.

1596
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:54,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Signed, Carl from Southampton, England.

1597
02:15:54,103 --> 02:15:54,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the email.

1598
02:15:55,025 --> 02:15:58,530
[SPEAKER_01]: That was lovely to hear from some folks we don't hear from all the time.

1599
02:15:58,570 --> 02:16:00,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage more folks.

1600
02:16:00,533 --> 02:16:01,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be shy.

1601
02:16:01,694 --> 02:16:02,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask a silly question.

1602
02:16:02,656 --> 02:16:03,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a silly answer.

1603
02:16:03,697 --> 02:16:06,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Or participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1604
02:16:06,682 --> 02:16:07,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that that was a silly question.

1605
02:16:07,783 --> 02:16:08,985
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good question.

1606
02:16:08,965 --> 02:16:29,438
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be interesting like we're talking about older episodes it would be and I know like we talk about AI and stuff but this is where we talk about AI in the sense that it's a utility and not necessarily replacing something but like to throw those old audio files that were made for dial-up radio through something to enhance the audio on them

1607
02:16:29,418 --> 02:16:31,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wonder if that would be a thing.

1608
02:16:31,581 --> 02:16:32,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

1609
02:16:32,242 --> 02:16:33,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1610
02:16:33,183 --> 02:16:33,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out.

1611
02:16:33,945 --> 02:16:34,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we could check it out.

1612
02:16:35,246 --> 02:16:37,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not opposed to it because I look at that as kind of like a tool.

1613
02:16:39,853 --> 02:16:40,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would want to know.

1614
02:16:40,855 --> 02:16:46,463
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a lot of questions about what's the tool and what's it going to save from what it listens to and those types of things.

1615
02:16:46,483 --> 02:16:47,805
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could be interesting.

1616
02:16:48,045 --> 02:16:49,367
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be very interesting.

1617
02:16:49,887 --> 02:16:50,288
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1618
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:53,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's it for the listener roundtable.

1619
02:16:53,315 --> 02:16:59,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with all the news and things we've covered tonight, I think that's it for the show.

1620
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:01,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for being here, though.

1621
02:17:01,373 --> 02:17:01,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you.

1622
02:17:01,934 --> 02:17:03,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, actually, Loki, did you have any other last minute stories?

1623
02:17:03,919 --> 02:17:05,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I only let you do one.

1624
02:17:05,362 --> 02:17:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah one quick thing is I didn't even know this was part of Street Fighter 6 but apparently Street Fighter 6 has a gallery section that you can play games in and so with their newest update with the DLC Fighter Alina they added some games to their game center so you can play Bionic Commando Street Fighter 2010 The Final Fight, Mighty Final Fight and Mega Man 3 they're fully playable oh yeah it's so random but I like that

1625
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:36,721
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1626
02:17:37,262 --> 02:17:39,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you as always for listening to Orange Rounds Radio.

1627
02:17:39,666 --> 02:17:42,631
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend about the show.

1628
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Help us spread the word.

1629
02:17:43,632 --> 02:17:45,035
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1630
02:17:45,155 --> 02:17:46,437
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more voices to put out on air.

1631
02:17:47,058 --> 02:17:51,646
[SPEAKER_01]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show.

1632
02:17:51,906 --> 02:17:53,188
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, one of our...

1633
02:17:53,168 --> 02:18:09,220
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1634
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:17,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a boo-boo and the wrong, in my naming commission, I uploaded the wrong file so you got the same episode twice.

1635
02:18:17,493 --> 02:18:22,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the way, if you did not hear last week's episode, there was a new episode, 1049 on June the 1st.

1636
02:18:22,461 --> 02:18:31,955
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did not hear it, go back in the podcast feed and grab it because it was corrected on Monday morning when I woke up to all the messages of, you fucked up!

1637
02:18:31,975 --> 02:18:33,498
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it happened.

1638
02:18:33,518 --> 02:18:34,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Look...

1639
02:18:34,259 --> 02:18:37,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, 1,049, now 1,050.

1640
02:18:39,266 --> 02:18:40,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Mistakes happen.

1641
02:18:40,508 --> 02:18:42,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

1642
02:18:42,391 --> 02:18:47,719
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely check out last week's episode if you didn't, but also check out, you know, future episodes and all that good stuff.

1643
02:18:49,001 --> 02:18:50,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Five-star reviews go a long way.

1644
02:18:50,543 --> 02:18:51,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that.

1645
02:18:51,825 --> 02:18:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get final thoughts and we'll get out of here for the night.

1646
02:18:54,749 --> 02:18:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, your final thought for tonight.

1647
02:18:57,496 --> 02:19:11,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they have to play more Mario Kart this week because my son's going to be taking... He's already played through, what is it, all of 50, 100, I think probably 150 at this point, like CC's unlocked almost everything already.

1648
02:19:12,141 --> 02:19:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully it's on his profile and not mine, but like, you know, we'll see.

1649
02:19:17,543 --> 02:19:42,876
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought tonight I'm probably doing a late night Pokemon stream I mean late night, sorry, West Coast and I think a lot of my streams are going to end up late night just because it's the easiest time for me to game I'm probably going to do a Pokemon stream tonight but I'm not rating into myself after the show because I can't do that and I'm going to eat dinner so maybe in about an hour or so we're going to have a late night Pokemon stream so I'm looking forward to that play some more Pokemon so I hope to see you there if not though I understand and I'll be streaming more throughout the week

1653
02:19:48,084 --> 02:19:50,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some more surprises, although I wouldn't hold my breath.

1654
