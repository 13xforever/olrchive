9785	12728	Hideo Kojima's career section on Wikipedia runs full circle.
13008	17033	The film-trained, film-producing hopeful is finally making a movie and for one of his own creations.
17453	18394	Okay, that isn't news.
18514	19896	We've known that since 2023.
20156	24581	Presumably its production wasn't as active along Death Stranding 2's production, but that is now an impending release.
24961	27584	However, the anime adaptation is news.
27604	29226	Keep on keeping on, Norman Reedus.
29246	34051	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34391	36754	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
42050	44132	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
44152	48316	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48396	51078	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
51138	60547	We are live once again with episode number 1049 of our show for tonight, June the 1st of 2025.
61628	65011	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm joined every week by my co-hosts.
65031	68935	Say hello, first and foremost, to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
73083	73805	Am I?
73985	74768	Yep, there you are now.
74828	75108	Hello.
76151	76613	I said hi.
76913	77154	Hi.
77395	78117	Well, it didn't come through.
79901	80423	How are you doing?
82007	82368	Tired.
82729	82990	Yeah.
83010	83832	At ballet rehearsal.
84273	88324	We have recital next week, so...
88473	111612	It certainly was fun.
111592	118340	I got to watch Jamie drink a very dark beer that made her feel a little fuzzy right off the bat.
118380	118820	It was fun.
120983	123646	Hey, I have a shortened digestive system.
124567	128471	Oh, thank you, Mishi.
128491	130954	Mishi, wish me good luck at the ballet recital.
131835	133577	Yeah, you'll get that.
133677	134578	You'll get that.
135233	140200	We are doing The Witch's Road from Agatha All Along.
141121	141522	That's a fun choice.
141542	144906	And then we're doing Dancing Through Life from Wicked.
146288	146548	It's hard.
146568	147610	I love that song.
147970	148471	That'll be fun.
148491	152797	We are doing the legit movie choreography for the last part of the song.
153217	153878	That's really cool.
155160	157003	Yeah, it's hard.
157023	157483	Nice, nice.
158024	161208	All right, well, let's say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
162490	162971	Hello.
162991	163752	Hey, how are you, Loki?
163912	163992	Hey.
164714	165060	Pretty good.
165243	165508	Yeah?
165752	166810	How was your weekend?
167819	170082	It's normal.
170102	197556	It's short.
197536	203707	and Loki has these games that play behind him while we are broadcasting and I don't recognize this one.
205290	210519	It says to a T. Oh, is this the new one from the Katamari guy?
211080	212242	Because it kind of looks like it.
212422	213203	Okay, okay.
213223	214646	And I've seen that on Game Pass.
215327	216329	I'm curious about that.
216349	217150	Have you played it at all?
218152	218493	I have.
219234	220717	Oh, all right.
220737	221518	It's adorable.
221667	225552	All right, I'll have to get more of your thoughts a little later when we get into our gaming weeks.
226053	230479	But first off, we need to get into the news for this week.
230499	231701	And we'll get into our kickoff topic.
232562	238490	This is a very interesting week we're sitting at here because we are really on the eve of a big week.
239211	240873	The Switch 2 is going to launch this week.
240933	243056	So the Switch 2 comes out on Thursday.
243277	243557	So I...
243537	247001	I can't remember the last time we sat here on the eve of a system launch.
247041	250384	It would have been like 2020 and that year was fucking weird to begin with.
250484	261256	So this really feels like the first time in a very long time we're sitting here with people actually going to be going to the store to pick up Best Buy or wherever to pick up their consoles or maybe having it delivered though.
261716	263398	Amazon didn't get in on the Switch 2 thing.
263418	264940	I think they've had some fighting.
265640	269805	So it's interesting, this whole new console feeling.
270165	272768	And then Friday...
272748	292242	Summer Game Fest Summer Game Fest
292222	311800	and so we're expected to get a lot of announcements out of that now of course Microsoft's doing their own thing too we have a couple other companies we'll get to that later on but we expect that there'll be quite a few announcements on Friday so this is a very big week for games so even though it didn't slow the news down for this week but we still have a lot of things to talk about but I know the Switch 2 is on everybody's mind right Loki?
312404	313646	Yes, it is.
314126	327605	And that's why, of course, people are paying attention to a Russian YouTuber who has allegedly already gotten their hands on a physical console.
327625	328726	Which, I mean, that makes sense.
328766	330829	They're out there already in the wild.
331430	335155	It's just, you know, if retailers break street date, then...
335607	358577	you know that you can get it so uh they've already been showing off what the console can do uh and that is not much because it needs a day one patch in order for it to actually unlock the console and allow it to play games using the cartridges and stuff like that but we got to see some menus so cool i guess um
359249	360851	Ooh, menu.
361372	363455	Menus, and it looks like the Switch.
364516	366479	I don't know.
366679	372067	It's neat, I guess, but also it's not super early.
372087	376453	I mean, it's next week or this week, so I don't know.
376553	381620	I'm less excited about it, but yeah, it is weird.
381720	382962	I mean...
383110	386115	I guess it makes sense to lock the console or whatever.
386296	391365	It does kind of suck though for the people that maybe don't have good internet or something like that.
391465	401203	You might not be able to play any games on it until you connect it to the internet but we live in the age of the internet so I guess it makes sense.
401875	403737	Um, but it's also interesting.
403757	413348	What about for people that aren't going to have internet accessibility, but I assume maybe either the date is hard coded or perhaps, uh, there's a lot of talk about that.
413368	418074	The early switch to games, which, you know, the few that are physical.
418194	425382	So what Mario Kart world and maybe one or two others, uh, will have some sort of firmware update in it or some sort of unlock.
425402	425943	Yeah.
425963	426063	Yeah.
426163	426263	Yeah.
426243	427565	This is probably very small.
427605	432071	It's probably more like a key that unlocks everything sort of thing.
432091	434574	So that's, yeah.
434594	437498	But I mean, the system is kind of very online as well.
437619	440262	I mean, I guess online isn't required, obviously, because it's portable.
440282	444909	But, you know, so much of the game sales are now with these game key cards.
444929	452459	It's almost like, I don't want to say internet connection is mandatory, but it's feeling pretty close.
452479	453921	Yeah, but it is.
454795	455318	I don't know.
455780	457890	It's just the direction that the industry is going.
458111	459458	I don't like it.
459478	462814	And the thing is, if you don't like it, you have options, so...
462895	488211	I don't know.
488191	489315	No, but you have a point.
489435	497003	Games don't leak when they are on this keycard download thing because you won't be able to download it until the official release.
497464	499652	So it will stop games from leaking.
499852	503879	I guess in that sense, but that's more of just like digital games.
503960	506404	And I don't know if it's Nintendo first party stuff, obviously.
506424	507386	No, most likely not.
507667	509851	So yeah, we'll still see it happen there.
510432	512215	But to what extent, who knows?
512235	513457	It is interesting.
513477	518086	We do not have any Mario Kart World footage outside of the official stuff and Treehouse and all that.
518106	520290	We don't have any leaks of that game yet.
520270	525939	and I don't anticipate there's going to be until the 5th of June.
526419	533470	So maybe the 4th because of time zones and Australia will be the first to get their go at it in that region.
533631	536575	So we'll see.
536791	537091	Yeah.
538273	538713	All right.
538733	543239	Well, now, did you decide you're going to get a Switch 2, Loki, or no?
543259	544741	I know Jamie wasn't going to get one.
544761	545421	You are going to get one?
545862	546543	Yeah.
546643	548465	Alan decided he wanted to keep his pre-order.
548485	551869	We got two just to make sure I would get one, and Alan was like, I want to have one.
551989	553211	I want to play it.
553251	561982	But he's also super into the Elden Ring, Bloodborne stuff, and so there's that one game that's coming out on Switch 2 that's going to be, yeah, for that platform, and I know he wants to play that whenever it comes out.
562002	563523	So there is reasons for it, but yeah.
563964	564064	Yeah.
564044	568492	Yeah, yeah, we have one ordered, so as long as the retailers don't screw us.
568633	573862	So far, I mean, no cancellation emails since we pre-ordered one month ago.
575966	578731	So, hopefully everything's good.
579493	579713	Yeah.
580775	582238	I don't see any point in getting one right now.
582607	608715	yeah that's fair there's not a lot of really like new games out the gate there's Mario Kart and like Donkey Kong isn't until next month I'm excited for the performance improvements to old games but I also understand that's not for everybody you know no I have not touched my Switch since other than playing Just Dance with the ballet group for Fuck It Friday yeah
608847	631446	I'm actually excited to try in a weird way I'm excited to try Pokemon Scarlet again but I'm worried that maybe I'm setting my expectations for how it's going to fix the game a little high and the performance are probably going to be nominal at best and not really fix some of the real issues I have with that game but we'll see we'll see I'm going to try to have faith but I realize I may be disappointed
631763	639542	I mean, what you're really forgetting is the true system seller for the Switch 2, and that is, of course, F-Zero GX.
639803	643071	Being able to play that online with friends is going to be huge, actually.
643151	644013	I'm really excited for that.
644033	647081	And Soul Calibur 2, quite frankly.
647181	649266	Both of those are really exciting.
649246	654695	Yeah, going to a chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night.
655076	659363	Dolly Partner is in chat saying, I still am worried about the Switch 2 logo.
659383	660525	It bothers me.
660545	665854	You know, I saw the post on Blue Sky about that too, where the logo is, it's just a giant 2.
666458	671805	But I guess there's only so many things you could do with it, but I get it, I get it.
671925	678433	Let's see, Rinmari in chat says, I did poke my Switch yesterday for an F-Zero community championship.
679214	684581	Yes, F-Zero is something I'm very hype about, the F-Zero GX.
684601	687825	I know you're talking about 99, but yeah, excited about that.
689088	691553	I'm waiting for Animal Crossing, so that's it.
691654	692957	Yeah, that'll be huge.
693197	698870	And that's one of those things where maybe we'll see it at Summer Game Fest, but I don't want to hype it too much.
699792	701515	Yeah, it might be a little early for that.
701535	703259	I think a 3D Mario game.
703279	706847	Maybe fall, if anything, like a direct during the fall.
706927	708210	I can't imagine a
708190	737033	I would think an Animal Crossing would be next year at the earliest to be honest so it probably doesn't get announced till you know early next year but Nintendo would be foolish not to be working on one as we speak it was such a it sold such gangbusters I mean granted a worldwide pandemic really helped them with that and stay at home stuff but you know I think there's still enough of an audience well if you play your cards right again Nintendo you might get your second pandemic it's true
737013	740804	Didn't they just discover their first measles cases here?
740824	742548	They have so many options.
742909	743712	That's right.
743752	746840	They're not going to let you get a vaccine now.
747141	752777	Here's whatever disease is going to come out of RFK from chugging shots of...
753787	767617	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
767917	770142	How was your gaming week?
771151	773854	Mass Effect and Dead by Daylight, pretty much.
775136	775756	Oh, and Palia.
775776	786489	I've been playing a lot of Palia because I am working on a house on my new property that is entirely built in the air.
788912	796180	I have, it's eight sets of stairs high with another two sets going to an upper loft.
797442	801649	And it's all also off of the property grid.
803291	805895	Defying the laws of physics and property ownership.
806376	807458	Because fuck their laws.
808960	811063	Fuck their boundaries and all of that.
811244	816833	To hell with the landlord.
817854	821440	I've been playing Fruit Mountain because I love that stupid game.
821620	822842	I really...
824577	825158	I don't know.
825379	827263	I'm liking my same games.
827283	829629	I've really been back into Mass Effect a lot.
829749	838971	I'm probably going to be playing Mass Effect tonight instead of Dead by Daylight because I want to wait until the new stuff comes out, I think.
838991	839532	We'll see.
840220	840681	Good times.
840721	845286	Well, Mass Effect 2 is only one of the greatest games ever made, so not a bad choice at all.
845306	848369	Mass Effect 3 is the best, but I'm on Mass Effect 2 right now.
848389	849190	Yeah.
849210	861184	And actually, playing them back-to-back really drives home just how much better the controls for Mass Effect 2 are, but it's a lot meaner, even in casual mode.
861704	865228	Which I'm just playing it because, again, I just want to get to the Garrus dating part.
866870	867831	The Garrus dating sim.
868958	869639	Exactly.
869659	873302	He's still in the middle of calibrations, and I just want to smack him around and say, Stop!
873322	876325	It's calibrated!
876345	876946	All right.
876966	877927	Well, we'll go over to Loki.
877947	878627	How was your gaming week?
880009	880669	It was all right.
881010	883012	I did try to play a few things.
883112	887716	So, Two of Tea is one that I did check out.
887796	893222	I made it through the first one and a half episodes of it.
893362	897666	I like how they kind of bookend all the episodes with a little musical number.
897646	926539	and it certainly does feel like it's out of the Katamari universe in fact it's funny the town itself that you're in initially it seems like it's like the end island of Katamari like I'm just waiting for the twist ending where this giant Katamari comes and just rolls up the whole island but wouldn't that be a gag though maybe that should happen it would be hilarious I don't think that's gonna happen since it's a different developer but um
926519	945928	or different publisher I should say and so I don't think that they would be allowed to do that but that would be really funny so there was that and then I started up a campaign in Final Fantasy 3 or 6 essentially and I've been playing through that a little bit
945908	947610	Not too far into that yet.
947891	955420	And then also I ended up playing Smurfs for the ColecoVision just to show my kids how stupid of a game that was.
956181	957903	The Smurfs Escape from Gargamel.
958504	960086	I'm like, yeah, it's a really short game.
960106	963170	Like you can beat the whole game essentially in like a minute.
964331	966194	It does get harder, though, as time goes on.
966254	968657	But it's yeah, it's bad.
968837	971140	And the emulation controls are not good either.
971120	991795	Thank you for watching!
993057	996987	I mean, with some editing, you could have fixed all that.
997007	1000556	There's not much... Unless there was no mic audio.
1000576	1002220	No, that's what was missing.
1002782	1003423	Oh, okay, okay.
1003504	1006351	I was going to say, yeah, the music itself just loops over and over.
1006371	1008737	It's just the jumping sound, so it really...
1009358	1031839	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1032224	1033508	So, yeah, I played that.
1034070	1036037	And, of course, lots of Minecraft.
1036138	1040332	Put out my Cracker Barrel episode thing with that.
1040493	1041998	And there's a whole, like...
1043007	1064863	you mean your legally distinct Cracker Barrel legally distinct Cracker Barrel yes yes yes highly inspired so I made that and put that video out and yeah now I just need to figure out what I'm going to do next because I don't know and probably lots of planning for the large project I'm going to be working on but content wise I don't know what I'm going to do right now
1066025	1066446	All right.
1067528	1068691	Well, then my gaming week.
1069172	1069633	Let's see.
1069794	1073683	I also played a little bit of Hylia because I've, you know, suddenly become addicted to that.
1074204	1076269	So making my way through that game.
1076689	1081300	I definitely don't have all the fancy shit that DarkSakura has, but I have a comfy...
1081280	1082583	I'll get there.
1082603	1103203	I'll get there.
1103183	1105407	It's a separate island.
1106389	1112662	It's a mechanic for the game that's very similar to some things they released in prior expansions, like Eureka.
1112682	1120738	I think Bose Jan was the name of the one during, not Endwalker, but oh my gosh, everything's a blur with expansions now.
1121339	1124044	Shadowbringers was the thing they put with that.
1124024	1127811	So they have this new island and it's, you know, it's neat.
1128091	1133240	It's very similar in many ways, I think, to Eureka, but a little more streamlined.
1133621	1138289	You don't have to worry about all the elemental stuff, but it's neat, but it's not very solo friendly.
1138309	1140733	And I have to admit, that's very disappointing.
1140713	1145279	is that we just really haven't had that solo-friendly hardcore casual content.
1145499	1155131	Last expansion, we had the Island Sanctuary, which I found to be extremely friendly solo mid-core content that you could do and really get rewards from.
1155151	1157674	And this, you can't really solo.
1157694	1161599	I mean, you can grind, but it's not really realistic.
1162180	1166485	And there's definitely benefits to grouping up, except Party Finder doesn't work when you're in the zone.
1166465	1181554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1181534	1182135	I'm going to say it.
1182415	1186981	And I know the Endwalker patches were not great with story, but at least the mechanics were decent.
1187201	1189264	This is the weakest expansion, period.
1189625	1198296	So I really hope that, you know, the 14 team is taking some of the feedback to light and is going to be instituting some changes with future expansions.
1199317	1201440	I really, you know, just hope to see a little bit more.
1201560	1205365	You know, I just don't understand why we couldn't have even had like an NPC that we could do stuff with.
1205385	1205726	I don't know.
1205946	1206647	It's a little bit...
1206627	1224045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1224025	1230992	If you are saying MMOs are only to be played with other people and never to be played by yourself, guess what?
1231212	1232593	That's a dated look.
1232613	1235136	And the industry is saying very different things on that.
1235156	1236737	So that's how I feel about it.
1238519	1249530	But interestingly enough, the right game came around at the right time to sort of scratch that interesting, I want to play an MMO, but I want to do it on my own schedule and by my own rules.
1249550	1251552	And that's Fantasy Life came out.
1251532	1276830	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1276810	1279053	Maybe I should have waited for Switch 2.
1279534	1282919	It might have been a little bit even better on that, but it's still fine.
1282939	1287325	Honestly, I bought it yesterday and I've already put like six hours into the game.
1287866	1289228	It's addicting.
1289288	1289808	It's fun.
1290109	1291070	I like it.
1291170	1292893	I liked the DS version of the game.
1292913	1294515	I never quite...
1294748	1313398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1313378	1314439	Oh, damn.
1314519	1318544	The treasure was a childhood picture of the... That's deep.
1318564	1319165	That's dark.
1319466	1322069	It throws these things at you.
1322209	1322850	It's neat.
1322870	1324632	So yeah, I'm enjoying it.
1324892	1327195	And yeah, I need to unlock more of the jobs.
1327215	1329818	But there's this whole side thing that's happening.
1329879	1334865	And it does this whole Breath of the Wild thing where the world starts off very, very small.
1334885	1337208	And then the world just explodes in size.
1337228	1338289	And you're like, oh my gosh.
1338269	1342555	So yeah, not to spoil, but these are all things that happen in the first couple hours of the game.
1342975	1345419	So yeah, I'm really, really enjoying it.
1345439	1352489	And I will definitely be playing more of it, especially this week as we lead up to the eventual release of the Switch 2, which I know is coming.
1352509	1353931	So very excited about that.
1354792	1356875	So yeah, been playing quite a bit of Fantasy Life.
1357496	1359298	So that's my gaming week.
1359751	1362037	Alright, let's get into some more stories.
1362057	1364663	Just a quick little housekeeping note before we do though.
1365004	1367430	In three weeks, we won't be here live.
1367530	1376713	June 22nd will not be here live because I will be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta, Georgia.
1376693	1403545	and that's my first of two trips this year because I'm going to DragonCon as well I did this a couple years ago and I really enjoyed Southern Fried and I was like you know I want to go back two trips a year is hard especially when it's so close together but this year because of like baseball play this venue where they have it at is like right across the freeway from where the Atlanta Braves play so when the Atlanta Braves have a game or something's going on at that stadium the hotel's full the parking lot's full all this stuff but
1403525	1424706	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1424686	1447738	And Bobby and I, of course Bobby's there because that's his backyard But Bobby and I will be doing a panel And we're going to be doing a panel on classic games Obscure kind of classic games that have not gotten enough Because it is a classic gaming expo But like things that have not gotten enough love Like there's classic games that everybody knows about But what about the really obscure ones?
1447758	1449580	Well by the way, that reminds me
1449880	1453168	I should mention this for my gaming week too, because I was at a friend's.
1453188	1456917	My friend has one of these, I think he bought it on Amazon or one of these things.
1456937	1458601	He has one of those arcade sticks, right?
1458641	1463252	It's like an arcade fighting stick, but it has a bunch of classic arcade games built in.
1463312	1465016	I'm sure it's of questionable legality.
1465036	1465577	Like a Pinterest box?
1465557	1467460	I think it's exactly what it is.
1467480	1468481	Yeah, Pandora's Box.
1468501	1474350	I think that's what the splash screen says.
1474831	1490113	Yeah, I've got one.
1490093	1519999	but we also played my friend was like oh let me show you this like hella weird obscure game I bet you've never heard of and it was Pepsi Man and I was like actually oh Pepsi Man actually thanks to our classic Game of the Week segment I have heard of this game before and so we played Pepsi Man which is it's like and even those of us that were kind of playing and watching were like this was like Temple Run's inspiration right here kinda it's one of those you know there's definitely a little bit of Sonic Adventure 2 but it's
1519979	1520660	It's great.
1521100	1523123	Yeah, it's well, I don't know if I should say it's great.
1523683	1527007	It's like it's it's cheesy movie.
1527147	1527468	Good.
1527888	1528829	It's so bad.
1529150	1530291	It's good.
1530311	1531953	It's it's that it's that.
1531973	1533114	But yeah, I definitely recommend.
1533234	1536478	But you know, it makes it, though, is all the live action cuts.
1536498	1537439	Oh, 100 percent.
1537459	1541384	Because I'm like, where is that strip mall today from the intro?
1541444	1546550	That just looked like a strip mall somewhere in like probably Woodland Hills or fucking Van Nuys or something.
1546570	1548172	Like, where is that strip mall today?
1548452	1548552	Yeah.
1548532	1577543	well on top of that just the original Pepsi Man commercials are hilarious so yes I had a good time with that game I'm trying to think if there's any other really obscure ones they were all playing this particular friend group of mine is really into fighting games and I will get into them once in a while but I don't I have to admit you guys I don't know them all so there is some game on PlayStation 5 that is I think based off an anime that is an up-dude version of a PlayStation 3 game
1578164	1600476	and unfortunately and the characters have really funny names and like one of them shoots bubbles one of them shoots rockets from her tits like it's really funny like and that game was really fun to watch and unfortunately I could not tell you the name of it I bet if somebody shouts it out in chat I'll be like yes it was that so or I could text my friend and be like what was that game I'm gonna do that I'm gonna text my friend right now and be like what was that game we'll see if I get a response during the show
1600456	1603419	Okay, now I really am done with my game of the week.
1603439	1605821	Sorry, I forgot the little classic nugget there.
1605861	1607743	So let's go to some more stories.
1607943	1609764	Did you play Segata Sanchiro?
1610965	1612687	No, it wasn't that.
1612707	1614689	But I did watch a little bit.
1614889	1616711	I mean, that wasn't the game that asked if you played it.
1617371	1628221	No, I didn't play that, but I did watch Project Justice because that new Marvel Capcom collection, or excuse me, the new Capcom collection certainly came up with, you know, Capcom SNK and all that shit in it.
1628241	1629602	So yeah, really good.
1630831	1633336	Okay, Loki, you can go.
1633576	1637163	We got some more news regarding Pokemon Legends ZA.
1637404	1651270	It's coming out in October, and they are going to be charging $10 for the Switch 2 upgrade, which is pretty common according to all the other stuff that's been released out there for the Switch.
1651250	1680666	Switch 2 or those upgrades you know for the first gen stuff um along with that I guess so it looks like the 16th in Japan I'm not sure that also coincides with the 16th of October here as well in North America but maybe we'll see um and then along with that of course they also announced that the next uh Pokemon Presents is going to be July 22nd 2025 so look forward to that I guess and more news
1681152	1682654	Coming out about Pokemon.
1682674	1689586	I really hope they drop a stealth update to updo Switch 1 Pokemon Legends for Switch 2, the Arceus.
1690087	1690868	I would love that.
1691188	1692370	I'm not going to count on that, though.
1692651	1694033	Pokemon Legends was so good.
1694153	1695816	It really is.
1695836	1698460	I think I might say, Derek, I say it's my favorite Pokemon game.
1698661	1699101	It really was.
1699121	1700383	So I'm really hyped for ZA.
1700423	1701225	I'll be buying that 100%.
1701525	1704510	Really excited for that.
1705115	1710361	But I finally stopped playing the trading card game that I was really into for a couple months.
1711122	1714766	I kind of fell off the wagon for a few days, and then I just never brought it up again.
1715067	1716969	But you know there's things to announce with that.
1717470	1719832	I'm sure there's other things to announce too.
1719933	1721234	Would it be time for a remake?
1722095	1722676	I think it might be.
1722716	1725519	That would be the next thing that Pokemon would be due for, wouldn't it?
1725539	1729564	There's Legends, and then next year there'll be a remake for Black and White.
1730605	1732067	Yeah, would they do...
1732537	1760316	more of like or even not even black and white would they do like um more of the early games like they redid for uh what was it the Eevee and Pikachu oh let's go let's go yeah there were always that rumors about like a gen 2 of that um I guess anything's possible but um I don't think that's on anyone's radar right now to be announced but that would be cute sure I mean I don't
1760296	1783485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1783465	1803398	and I don't know if this is like a sense of false security they've been doing a lot of interesting things in Pokemon Go lately like they allowed people to give away a quest that they would usually charge 99 cents for for free as part of a event which was cute and then like Pikmin Bloom has been looking to a lot more corporate sponsorships lately
1803378	1805160	to try to kind of maintain that game.
1805180	1809906	They do a lot more local events or they might turn like a local event into a worldwide thing.
1809967	1818998	For example, I'm participating in the Hot Girl Walk, which starts tomorrow, which apparently is a real event like down in Santa Monica or something.
1819018	1822463	But you are able to participate worldwide with the virtual Hot Girl Walk.
1822483	1823664	So of course I'm participating.
1823985	1825306	Get my hot girl on.
1825326	1828170	So it's, you know, that's something that
1828150	1829672	It hasn't changed yet.
1830333	1833778	And I completely understand all the reservations people have.
1833858	1834960	Saudi Arabia, da-da-da.
1835360	1835981	I get it.
1836001	1842190	But I'm not going to rage quit those games until there is actually an action that substantiates the rage quit.
1842210	1843893	I'm not going to rage quit over a hypothetical.
1844554	1846777	So we'll see what happens.
1846797	1848299	We'll see.
1848319	1850663	Anyway.
1850743	1852285	Well, that was it for Pokemon Legends then.
1853243	1883183	yes sure SG100 Matt does point out safe bet we'd see some Switch Online versions of classic games you know that is something we're missing and we haven't had in a while I mean we had the 3DS had the that's where like Pokemon Home kind of started you could do or it was called Pokemon Bank right you could play the classic games like Pokemon Yellow and then put your Pokemon in Pokemon Bank it would be nice if the Switch 2 would have something like that and that would be really cool if it was timed for Pokemon Legends maybe so that would be
1883163	1887987	That would be a neat little thing and maybe drive some more Pokemon Home subscriptions, but we'll see.
1888007	1890118	Anyway, let's talk about...
1890571	1891413	You want to say something?
1891433	1892515	No, I said, yeah, that'd be a good idea.
1892575	1893416	Yeah, yeah, for sure.
1893917	1895520	All right, let's talk about Dragon Quest.
1895560	1904296	You know, we've been waiting a little bit now for the 1 and 2 HD 2D remake because, of course, last year brought us the Dragon Quest 3 HD 2D remake and it did very well.
1904717	1910026	Well, this week it was announced that Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D will also be going to the Switch 2.
1910106	1913753	They have confirmed they will be making a specific Switch 2 version.
1913773	1914975	That is in addition...
1914955	1916577	to a Switch version of the game.
1917038	1921685	And of course, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PC and all that good stuff.
1921705	1926032	$60 is the price and it will be out on October 30th.
1926372	1938651	But if you are feeling extra spendy, you can get the exclusive collector's edition exclusively through the Square Enix store for just $150.
1938631	1962478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1962458	1964902	You get in-game items.
1964962	1967446	You get exclusive digital wallpapers.
1967766	1968227	Ooh, ah.
1968748	1972434	And a very vague pre-order bonus, which really could be anything.
1972454	1981668	But I would assume maybe those Legos and having a complete collection of that might be... Or excuse me, legally distinct Legos might be alluring to some people.
1981688	1983331	So you do have that.
1983351	1984112	So...
1984362	2009847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2010822	2011844	Oh, yes.
2012326	2014230	Well, we were in for it.
2014330	2015393	It was bound to happen.
2016034	2018801	I hate that it's happening to this group.
2019242	2023512	But Playtonic is having to lay off over a dozen staff.
2023652	2026659	We mean, we don't really know how many staff they have.
2026719	2029506	They've listed about 50 people on LinkedIn.
2029486	2038856	But for those who don't remember, this is the group that did Yooka-Laylee, which is the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie.
2038876	2042159	It's made by former Rare staff that worked on that game.
2043241	2052290	And I mean, this is ahead of the release of Yooka-Replaylee.
2052510	2053992	That's actually kind of a clever name.
2053972	2080030	so it's I mean we don't really know how big the team is um but the people that are being laid off work in production art design game design narrative design and you uh UX design so UI UX so um I mean they've had issues with with funding you know before I mean that they they
2080668	2083093	They had a good track record with games.
2083113	2091993	I mean, two, yeah, they launched on Kickstarter pretty much, but we expected quality.
2092655	2096483	And now I don't know what's going to happen, if they're even going to make it through everything.
2097779	2122048	that's unfortunate I feel like that Yooka-Laylee did pretty really well you see it everywhere I mean yeah well they had other games yeah of course but maybe that's a sign they were giving it away at some point but still I don't know like Demon Turf, Little Gator Game a few other things but and I mean and they have their past reputation with Rare sure you know but yeah it's sad
2122096	2122617	It is.
2122757	2128206	Especially on the eve of the Switch 2 where you think would be a console that would lend itself very well to the types of games they're developing.
2128367	2129909	This is very unfortunate.
2129929	2132213	But look who's been tanking the economy.
2133215	2133916	There is that.
2133936	2135659	There is that.
2135679	2136500	Alright, moving on.
2136540	2136861	Loki.
2138684	2139065	Alright.
2139986	2140527	Uh...
2141249	2154793	So there's a brand new game, and I keep forgetting about this, probably because it feels like it's so far off, but Mind's Eye, it was by Leslie Benzies, who was the original designer for Grand Theft Auto.
2155214	2165873	I think he was a lead designer as well for Grand Theft Auto 5, and still has his game coming soon, but also looking to try to...
2165853	2169181	Get people to make content for it somehow.
2169481	2183794	It says the studio will support the game through PlayMind's Eye with continuous new content, but also hoping to supplement that with user-made content as well.
2183774	2212971	hopefully we'll have some some of them will create compelling content and by some I mean a team at Build A Rocket Boy which is selling the game for $60 with a premium pass and stuff like that so they want me to pay for the game and also make content for it yeah I don't know this seems confusing as far as like you know how it's coming out and all that stuff but it does look like you know like a Cyberpunk Grand Theft Auto and those are two things I like so
2214757	2217943	Let's see how it looks when it comes out.
2217963	2224115	But right now, yeah, I don't like the idea of developers wanting people to make them content for free.
2224195	2226219	Make a good game and then people will make content.
2227441	2233893	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out, that was LittleBigPlanet's entire gimmick, paid for it to make content for it.
2233913	2235536	I mean... Well, that's the game.
2235556	2237440	You're basically making...
2237842	2241847	Yeah, you're making an editor, but, like, is this that type of game?
2241867	2245071	This isn't made to be, like, a little big planet.
2245091	2252039	Like, you could make that same argument with Grand Theft Auto as well because you have, like, the mission editor and, like, the race editor and stuff like that.
2252059	2257165	And people coming up with their deep dive roleplay content on Twitch and all that stuff is pretty wild.
2257245	2262111	Well, that's separate from all of that, but, yeah, it is...
2262817	2285787	it's both of them to ask for people to pay that money and then also make content for them make a good game, people will be happy to make additional content for them if they're excited about it, they're going to make content for it don't just lead with that let it happen a little bit organically
2286290	2292997	All right, well, our next story is something that ought to be completely stinking obvious, but it's not.
2293077	2296280	And maybe, I don't know, maybe it isn't that obvious, but it seems pretty obvious to me.
2296800	2311335	And that is that the Switch 2 is the cartridges they are saying with the game cards and the game key cards, they're saying, don't get them too close to magnets.
2311315	2312117	That's right.
2312137	2312577	Of course.
2313379	2319431	There's some box art that has been released for Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster.
2319952	2332817	There is a little bit of an underlined warning on the back of the box in Japanese, which says a game key card could become unusable if it comes into contact with a strong magnet.
2333388	2345015	It's worth pointing out that warning is not on other game key card boxes, but I just feel like that shouldn't be completely unreasonable of a warming.
2346218	2347561	You also shouldn't lick them.
2347581	2350327	I was thinking it was common sense, but people don't have that.
2350648	2352392	And, you know, to be fair...
2352524	2355487	You may not realize some magnets that you have.
2355907	2362613	You may not want to put a GameKey card in your wallet if you have some type of magnetic clip on it.
2362753	2363814	I don't know.
2364114	2367257	Or a lot of chargers now are magnetics.
2367317	2372242	You might not want to have your GameKey cards sitting out too close to chargers and things like that.
2373102	2375925	But you also don't want your bank cards near those things.
2376145	2379088	So yeah, it should be obvious, but maybe not.
2379108	2381670	Allow me to present...
2381650	2383332	Bring a lead case with you.
2384834	2398211	Well, I'm just thinking, I mean, granted, I think it's engaged by electricity, so I don't know how strong they are outside of that, but the Switch has magnetic Joy-Cons.
2400253	2401495	That is kind of funny.
2401595	2407843	I get it, that it's engaged with an electromagnet,
2408144	2411008	But there is a magnet in there to get it on there, obviously.
2411068	2412970	It's not just always going.
2413010	2418437	But it's a relatively strong magnet if it's going to hold the weight of the system up.
2418457	2422963	So kind of a thing that you probably should have thought about.
2424125	2424785	I love the idea.
2424846	2427028	DarkSakura said a lead carrying case, though.
2427048	2432395	And I love the idea of a DarkSakura lead Nintendo Switch 2 carrying case.
2432856	2433437	It's heavy.
2433697	2433797	Yeah.
2437760	2441003	And you might get cancer.
2441023	2451052	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I have a MagSafe pop socket for my phone and it totally demagnetizes those paper tickets that get you in and out of parking garages.
2451452	2456377	Like if I take the pop socket off my phone, the magnet there will demagnetize anything.
2456397	2462562	And Ranmari points out that DarkSakura's lead carrying case may need a Proposition 65 warning.
2462582	2464844	You know, that you see on the door of like every restaurant.
2465745	2467767	No, that's the one thing that doesn't need it.
2467747	2470692	May contain lead.
2470852	2471934	Does contain lead.
2472254	2473116	It is lead.
2473256	2473937	It is lead.
2475119	2475860	It's all lead.
2476381	2476742	All right.
2477002	2477723	Always has been.
2479086	2479667	Moving on.
2479707	2481369	Let's go back to you, Loki, for our next story.
2482872	2483393	All right.
2483513	2489603	So Fortnite finally coming out of the darkness on the App Store or well,
2489903	2494792	Off the App Store because it was banned off of the Apple App Store for the longest time.
2494812	2499840	But thanks to ongoing litigation, it is now back on the App Store.
2500141	2504709	And you can download your Fortnites and play your Fortnites through the App Store.
2504729	2508836	You make it sound like Fortnite's been struggling through these dark times.
2509016	2511521	They've been struggling through these dark times.
2511541	2512182	Please, please.
2512162	2520937	Can you imagine all of the possible collaborations that they've had to bypass because of all the litigation and money that's gone to it?
2521138	2524163	I don't even recognize this game anymore.
2524203	2527929	All the spinoff games they weren't able to do with Fortnite Festival.
2527949	2528871	We could have had...
2528851	2539710	We could have had AI Luke and Darth Vader, but no, we had to suffer not having AI Luke and only Darth Vader because of this.
2540171	2541753	This is the recession that we're in.
2542595	2546742	So I hope you understand, you know, the trouble we are all going through with this.
2546722	2549206	I'm going to sound so old.
2549246	2560947	I'm going to sound very Gen X, boomer, whatever, saying this, but I still don't understand how somebody plays Fortnite, Battle Royale specifically, on a phone in the first place.
2562610	2566637	Regardless of whether it's iPhone or Google, I don't understand
2566617	2570102	Like, especially, like, don't you snipe in that game?
2570122	2571464	You have sniper controls and stuff?
2571504	2573507	Like, it just seems like it's a pain.
2573527	2575430	But I know kids do it.
2575450	2576511	I guess some adults do.
2576992	2584743	You know, we've all seen the videos of people sitting at, like, an important function or something, and somebody in the row in front of them is playing Fortnite.
2585224	2588288	So I know people can do it, but it's just like, dang.
2588268	2593155	Now I would think something like Fortnite Festival might be easier because you could like tap the screen.
2593175	2594077	That makes sense.
2594497	2595199	That I get.
2595840	2601288	But, you know, yeah, Bobby Blackwell for chat says touch controls are natural for younger players nowadays.
2601308	2602109	I don't know.
2602129	2602730	It's wild.
2603411	2608639	Do your kids play Fortnite on mobile or like iPad or one of those types of things, Loki?
2608737	2610819	They do not touch their tablets.
2610960	2621352	Yeah, we got them nice tablets one year, and that lasted for about a year, and then they got laptops the next year, and then those tablets have never been used again.
2622373	2624295	And they don't play Fortnite.
2624976	2627759	They play dumb shit on Roblox.
2627960	2630943	They're still playing... What was it?
2631063	2635048	Forsaken, which is that... It's like a knockoff...
2635028	2664782	Dead by Daylight and then they also play I Saw My Son Hanging Out in that Grow a Garden just only because it's popular not because he wants to but because it's memeable right now there's like 11 million players on that thing which is stupid but yeah that trash is they've been playing Forsaken for days now days I'm like why don't you just play the regular Dead by Daylight but no
2666652	2667474	Weird.
2667915	2668317	All right.
2668337	2671405	And all the killers are like, they're all Roblox lore.
2671445	2674153	So it's like the hackers and stuff like that.
2674193	2675717	Like the...
2675883	2681512	Classic, like, noob and stuff is one of the survivors or something.
2681652	2681993	I don't know.
2682033	2682413	It's weird.
2682433	2685118	I know I've seen, because it comes off around my TikTok once in a while.
2685218	2692389	I've seen, like, the Roblox, like, Dead by Daylight sort of port, like, with the Huntress and, like, killers that actually exist in Dead by Daylight.
2692449	2695474	Like, that they're playing in Roblox, which is wild to me.
2695494	2700602	But I also, the one I get most often on TikTok that does, I will admit, it makes me laugh.
2701183	2703527	It's people that are playing Squid Games.
2703507	2718280	because there's some type of like Squid Games port on there and they're just screaming going bananas in those games because, you know, in the new season there's the one where they have to get so many people in a room or they get locked out, that type of thing.
2719642	2723425	I get video upon video of people playing that and screaming it.
2724766	2726648	They have the new trailer out for season three.
2726888	2728530	Jump rope's in there.
2728590	2729451	I didn't see that.
2729471	2732113	I don't watch that.
2732330	2734994	By the way, I got an answer to my earlier question.
2735435	2738559	What was the game I saw that started as a PS3 game, the fighting game?
2738860	2744008	The answer is it was called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Stars Battle R. Oh, shit.
2744028	2744789	Yeah, that sounds about right.
2744829	2745470	That was the game.
2745550	2746652	That sounds like a JoJo game.
2746772	2747072	Yeah.
2748795	2749997	That was funny.
2750157	2750357	Yeah.
2751239	2752781	All right, DarkSakura, we'll go back to you.
2754644	2756667	Okay, so...
2757237	2759240	Why is it that I'm delivering all the bad news?
2759260	2762846	Anyway, the Black Panther game got cancelled.
2763827	2767173	Yeah, and thank you EA for being shitty again.
2768575	2782857	They have actually ended the studio that's behind it, Cliffhanger Games, that was formed by former Monolith productions leaders.
2782837	2798027	but yeah the cuts are being instituted quote to sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities I mean um
2800235	2809768	If the game was bad and wasn't doing Black Panther justice... Yes, this news is frustrating because we... You didn't say anything about that.
2809968	2810789	Yeah, I know, I know.
2810809	2813533	But we get layoff story after layoff story after layoff story, right?
2814114	2821804	But if the game was on track to be a Suicide Squad type of arrival type of game...
2821784	2849412	I can understand why EA games get cancelled sometimes sometimes it's quality, sometimes it's market demand but I don't think it's that I think people would have ate the fuck up out of a Black Panther game so I'm left to believe in the lack of any specifics because everything in this industry is so goddamn secretive I'm left to infer, believe that the game must not have been up to a certain level of quality and again, this was these screenshots look amazing
2849392	2865375	it was almost certainly not the fault of the developers on the front line but probably some type of monetization direction they were trying to go with in the game and you know how that always gets things fucky especially at EA so you know it's a bummer
2866182	2879834	It actually looks like there was some concept art and some... Looks like some other stuff from within the game that make it look really gorgeous.
2881095	2889083	And that it was... You were going to be playing as T'Challa's son and you were going against Skrulls.
2889103	2893827	And, I mean, it honestly looks...
2896118	2916473	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2918258	2919681	All right.
2919701	2939338	Well, let's talk about another feature of the Switch 2.
2939318	2958913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2958893	2963642	Just needing that little extra power to do a very simple graphic filter melted the Switch 1.
2963762	2966247	I don't know, but it's something that's only going to be available on Switch 2.
2966687	2973861	And then you can also view and change controls, meaning remap all of the buttons, which ought to be fucking standard for anything, but okay.
2973881	2975063	Oh, that, no, I'm sorry.
2975043	2980011	Actually, I correct myself, that feature will also be on original Switch when it rolls out.
2980031	2982115	So I'm going to pull it back a little bit.
2982476	2986222	So at least there will be the remapping ability on Switch and Switch 2.
2986342	2990389	So that is all coming with the release of the Switch 2 on June 5th.
2990409	2992292	You don't have to wait any longer for that.
2992272	3010888	so I think I think it's funny I think there are a lot of people that like one of the first things they're going to play on their Switch 2 is like F-Zero GX and like the classics and stuff because again I can't wait for multiplayer on that stuff it's gonna be fun all right well speaking of classic stuff let's go to our bumper for the next segment
3022478	3029921	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3030362	3033231	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3033751	3043447	Alright, but once a month, DarkSakura flips the script a little bit and says, you know what, we're going to do a game that is a console to arcade.
3043507	3046592	It originally was on consoles, but went to the arcade.
3046793	3051060	And I never even realized this company ever made any arcade games ever.
3051180	3052502	So let's hear more about this.
3053782	3063641	All right, so first of all, the game in question came out in 1994 in the arcade from a console game, and it is Battletoads Arcade.
3064623	3071396	So it had also been known as Super Battletoads or just Battletoads, but it is a side-scrolling beat-em-up arcade game.
3072619	3075925	It was developed by Rare and published by EA.
3075905	3082718	It is up to three players, and you go through six levels to save the universe from the Dark Queen.
3083259	3092175	You have vertical levels, bonus levels, everyone has their own attack, and they've also got some fourth wall breaking funds.
3092155	3093558	I said funds.
3093699	3094180	Fun stuff.
3095022	3099934	Also, Rare went a little bit more with the violence on this one.
3099994	3107532	It was their first game to use 3D graphics that was later implemented in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct.
3107512	3126740	The gameplay tested pretty well and seemed viable but there was some hesitation behind releasing it and it ended up being unsuccessful and so Rare cancelled any ports that they had including a completely finished and tested Game Boy version.
3128682	3136033	And yeah, actually this game was the reason that there had been no more Battletoads until 2020.
3136013	3152875	it has since been released on console when it was emulated for Rare Replay it came out in 2015 a compilation of Rare games on Xbox One and people were like
3153732	3159882	Really surprised at just how high quality the arcade release was and thought it was one of the best ones.
3161104	3163007	It was a really good quality game.
3163027	3164229	The highlight of the series, they said.
3164649	3166052	Of that package, sorry.
3168255	3169497	But...
3169477	3187266	you know, you have the usual Battletoads stuff, you eat flies to regenerate health you beat stuff up, you know and each level has a unique name, like you have Christmas Grotto and some of the bosses from earlier games come back, like General Slaughter and
3188360	3207060	but it seemed that Rare developed it directly it was published by EA in 1994 it's the fifth Battletoads game they were really trying to follow the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game
3208087	3233402	and they were also experimenting with 3D graphics that were using an application called Power Animator which later on became Autodesk Maya which I took some college classes in and it was their first rare game that used this and of course as I said earlier it was later implemented in Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Country the game
3234344	3250210	Thank you for watching!
3251945	3276788	so for the rare replay version that I mentioned earlier they did put in the setting for Unlimited Continues a rewind and replay and a save game progress at any time but they said it bombed badly they said the sales were mediocre and the arcade release rode on the success of the console games and just did not do it um
3278405	3299080	and it was though given a 4 out of 5 stars by some reviewers even comparing it to Turtles in Time and Simpsons Arcade and has been since considered while relatively obscure it's the best in the series and an absolute swan of a rare game
3299060	3311830	It was put on par with the games from Konami and Sega and said it was humorous and funny and that it was absolutely a blast to play.
3312953	3314296	So why it didn't do better?
3314697	3315800	Who knows?
3315820	3317524	But that's why you don't hesitate!
3318500	3348338	as far as its legacy like I said the franchise did go on hiatus after this game and the re-release was 26 years later with a 2020 series reboot and then Rare considered doing a possible sequel in the mid 2000s but they really didn't want to make a failure like at the time the TMNT reboot had been
3348318	3368065	so but their expectations were low but people wanted it and so the newer ones caught on and this one sort of fell into obscurity until that compilation release so there you go, Battletoads Arcade
3369108	3370150	Yeah, great pick.
3370170	3374260	I'm kind of with some folks in chat who this was just not on their radar.
3374320	3378028	I'm almost embarrassed to say it, but I never realized they did an arcade version of this game.
3378710	3380895	TigerClaw says, never played the arcade version.
3380975	3383340	I would assume it has those difficult stages later on.
3384403	3386728	You know, that would be one way to get your quarters, wouldn't it?
3387367	3394721	And I should say that this was not really a port from any of the home versions, but it was a home franchise that came out in the arcade.
3394901	3399449	Right, yeah, it looks way better than the home versions, to be quite honest.
3399509	3401132	Like, yeah, it looks great.
3402134	3406422	And they used, like, you know, they were using early...
3406402	3428697	3D in these games yeah I always love that in the Battletoads games where like the giant like fist or the giant like shoe that comes out and kicks people I always thought that was such a neat piece of flair in the Battletoads games but yeah you know and I when I originally had brought up your long play of this and saw the Electronic Arts logo I was like
3428677	3431400	Did they ever have arcade games?
3431420	3433822	But I actually was corrected in chat.
3433862	3436484	DarkTetsuya said EA had a few arcade games.
3436504	3437665	There was a Madden game.
3437725	3439467	I guess I should have assumed that was a thing at some point.
3439948	3442170	And a couple of the Need for Speed games.
3442210	3443371	Of course, of course, those.
3443431	3445072	Yes, I did neglect those.
3445713	3447154	Got arcade ports randomly.
3447174	3450578	But still, it's not often you see the Electronic Arts logo on an arcade game.
3450598	3453580	This is a very special sort of release, I think.
3454001	3455342	So, yeah.
3455744	3456586	Neat pick.
3456606	3457067	There it is.
3457087	3461415	Battletoads, your classic console to arcade game of the month.
3462798	3463099	All right.
3464021	3468630	With that, let's move into some rapid fire news and talk about some other headlines real quick.
3469231	3470614	Loki, we'll go to you first.
3471067	3475894	We have some more details regarding the Switch game compatibility with the Switch 2.
3476534	3479899	We had kind of a long list of games that weren't supported initially.
3480460	3490974	And now, at least of first-party games, that has been whittled down to quite a few games that are not compatible.
3491975	3495440	Only like five we have, so not too bad.
3495460	3500787	Of course, the most obvious, Nintendo Labo VR.
3501070	3504233	Just not going to work because the headset is just completely a different size.
3504734	3506075	So that makes perfect sense.
3506495	3511100	However, you can still do Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 1, 2, and 3.
3511440	3520710	You just have to use that with the original Switch Joy-Cons instead because of the IR stuff and all that.
3520730	3529018	Other games that are not compatible, their first party, Nico Nico, Abma, Hulu, Crunchyroll, and Inkypen.
3528998	3533412	are the five apps or whatever that are not compatible.
3533933	3542400	Other games that also require the Switch 1 Joy-Cons, Rig Fit Adventure, 1-2 Switch, Everybody 1-2 Switch.
3542532	3545235	Just do yourself a favor and don't get those.
3546036	3553805	Game Builder Garage, Nintendo Switch Sports, WarioWare Move It, and then, of course, Nintendo Labo.
3554306	3560853	I can definitely guess by WarioWare Move It, Switch Sports, and I'm guessing the other ones, it's all because of that IR sensor.
3560893	3562475	That's why you need the other ones.
3563056	3568943	Third party, there's a lot more stuff outside of that, but that's at least what you have for first party stuff.
3568963	3569063	Okay.
3570528	3587760	uh yeah Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out to be fair with many of these it's just certain features so yeah like certain yeah mini games in WarioWare are not going to work and things like that but it's important to know before you get into it especially when we talk about a very big backwards compatible library it's not all encompassing so uh DarkSakura
3588652	3592958	So, well, there's going to be more Death Stranding stuff.
3593078	3598345	Kojima revealed that there is an anime in the works.
3598885	3605774	He just put it out, says, I'm currently working with A24 on a live-action film adaptation, he said.
3606335	3614245	And then the next quote is this, when it comes to adapting games into visual media, there are works like The Last of Us, which stay true to the original storyline, and films like the Super Mario Bros.
3614265	3616268	movie, which is more of a service to fans of the game.
3616789	3617730	I'm going to keep reading.
3617710	3644460	all these works have their own merits as a film enthusiast I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema I aim to create a Death Stranding that can be realized through film one could win awards at films like the Cannes Festival or Venice Festival in fact we are also currently working on an anime adaptation he's really ambitious for this he really really wants this to be a thing but you know the first game did pretty well yeah so yeah
3645301	3648225	All right, well, I have some news on the Evercade front.
3648245	3651409	So, you know, I'm a casual fan of the Evercade stuff.
3651469	3652190	I like collecting them.
3652210	3653032	I have one behind me.
3653052	3653753	It's a little hard to see.
3653773	3654954	Sometimes we're broadcasting live.
3655295	3659060	But I have one of these little smaller cabinets.
3659200	3663546	It's, I guess, a bar top arcade is what they call it, an alpha machine.
3663526	3670514	So I have one that's Capcom, specifically Mega Man branded, and there's also a Street Fighter one that has games baked into the machine.
3670534	3673517	They're not on cartridge, but they're games baked into the machine.
3673577	3677302	Probably that's the only way they can get the license rights or whatever for it.
3677322	3685811	Well, it turns out Taito is going to be teaming up with Evercade, and there's going to be a Taito-themed Bartop Arcade coming that is going to be Bubble Bobble-themed.
3685912	3691558	Well, I guess by default, but the little light box above...
3691538	3696405	They send you little sheets, little plastic sheets for all the games in the collection.
3696645	3702093	So I could make this a Strider cabinet if I wanted to because they gave me a sheet for that and all the games that are in it.
3702173	3708322	So I would assume the title will have multiple besides just Bubble Bobble, but I don't want to assume either.
3708762	3720379	But we do know the games that will be in the bar top will be Bubble Bobble, Kadash, Elevator Action, The Fairyland Story, Growl, The Legend of Kage, The New Zealand Story, Puzzle Bobble, Rastan.
3720399	3721140	I love New Zealand Story.
3721120	3723202	and Space Invaders.
3723222	3730048	Now, what's also interesting is that if you, I mentioned that it was probably due to rights that they're baked in.
3730088	3734192	Actually, they will be doing separate Taito cartridges.
3734212	3738996	So the bar top arcade is pre-ordered on May 30th.
3739357	3740518	So it already happened.
3740538	3743300	It will go for either 200 euros.
3743660	3747304	I'm sorry, 200 pounds, 220 euros or $250.
3747344	3748765	Okay.
3749470	3752354	I wonder why the dollars are more this time.
3752374	3753415	You don't usually see that.
3753495	3754096	Hmm.
3754116	3756138	I wonder what happened.
3756158	3756419	Thanks.
3756659	3757060	Hmm.
3757080	3758421	Thanks, Trump.
3758441	3758702	All right.
3759222	3760784	But it will be launching in November.
3761365	3763828	If you want to get the cartridges separately, you can.
3763848	3766752	So you can get separate cartridges and you would actually get more games.
3767112	3768354	Taito Arcade 1.
3768855	3771698	I want both of these cartridges, especially when I tell you the lineup.
3771718	3777165	Taito Arcade 1, Bubble Bobble, Chack and Pop, Colony 7, Dandoko Dawn,
3777145	3783035	Growl, Space Invaders, Pirate Pete, Ranma S, and The Legend of Kage.
3783476	3795938	And then Arcade 2 has Alpine Ski, The Electric Yo-Yo, Elevator Action, Kiki Kaikai, Liquid Kids, Rastan, Operation Wolf, The New Zealand Story, and Volfied.
3797020	3801347	That second one sounds better because Kiki Kaikai, I mean, that was Haki and Raki.
3801327	3811020	Yeah, yeah, so that's coming September, and those cartridges will cost you 20 euros, I'm sorry, 20 pounds, 25 euros, or $30.
3811080	3820753	Again, now we feel the pain of the dollars being more than the others because of who we elected.
3821729	3846471	by the way I have more actually this is turning not so rapid but uh there's just a lot of Evercade news this week we know more Neo Geo cartridges are coming we already heard about Neo Geo Arcade 1 but we also announced uh this week in October Neo Geo Arcade 2 with Artifighting 2, Crossed Swords, Garou Mark of the Wolves, Metal Slug 2, Ninja Commando, and Sengoku 2
3846451	3858294	and Neo Geo Arcade 3 with Ghost Pilots, Metal Slug 3, Samurai Showdown 2, Super Sidekicks, King of Fighters 97 and Twinkle Star Sprites.
3858314	3859116	Awesome.
3859136	3860238	Oh, Twinkle Star Sprites.
3860459	3861220	All coming out.
3861621	3867733	And those will be again, 20 pounds, 25 euros, $30.
3869198	3883900	or DarkSakura.com.
3884167	3886774	Meanwhile... Maybe the world will burn.
3887837	3888057	We'll see.
3888699	3896620	Anyway, let's move on to world release dates and check out what else is coming out a little sooner than those Evercade cartridges.
3896640	3898605	This week, busy week, right, Loki?
3898906	3899307	There's...
3899287	3900950	There's a new console coming.
3900970	3902072	There's going to be a lot.
3902092	3902933	Switch 2 stuff.
3903174	3904877	So I hope you're ready for Switch 2 things.
3906299	3910807	So we've got Rise of Industry 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

3986245	3989549	We have Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour.
3989569	3990490	Just don't buy that game.
3990771	3992473	Seriously.
3992842	4012825	Nobunaga's Ambition Awakening Complete Edition on Switch 2 and PlayStation 5 Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S on Switch 2 The Red Bell's Lament on Nintendo Switch Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2

4058519	4060483	Alright, I'm going to just keep it real.
4060503	4069804	I'm going to just say ditto for the Switch 2 releases for Japan because it's a very similar list worldwide and let's be real, I'm not going to read through that entire list of releases.
4069824	4070686	There's a lot.
4070786	4074093	So we're just going to say ditto on Japan and UK, I guess.
4074474	4076198	But I will just peak quickly.
4076278	4076899	I do want to
4076879	4093065	Look at PlayStation 5 in Japan.
4093045	4094647	also on June 5th.
4094767	4096409	So that may be of interest to you.
4096429	4102015	And then Saga Frontier 2 Remastered also gets a physical release in Japan on the PlayStation 5.
4102415	4108962	Nobunaga's Ambition Rebirth also hits Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.
4109403	4112786	So otherwise, I'm just going to say ditto on the Switch 2 launch.
4113447	4116130	Jamie, anything you want to clarify with UK outside of Switch 2?
4117331	4119253	I believe I answered that question already.
4119613	4119894	All right.
4121816	4122917	Yeah, there's nothing.
4122948	4125010	All the same!
4125030	4127072	Oh, wait, wait.
4127513	4128153	Wait, wait.
4128174	4129575	There's one thing.
4129595	4134740	There's Tour de France 2025 on June 5th.
4134760	4136202	And Pro Cycling Manager.
4137583	4141247	Do you get to spin the sticks so hard you break your thumb on those games?
4142248	4143610	Oh, actually, no, I take that back.
4144751	4145151	Never mind.
4145512	4148595	There's an early access for Dune Awakening for PC.
4149116	4149456	Cute.
4150257	4150457	That's it.
4151686	4155393	Alright, just a couple more stories and we'll get to the listener roundtable.
4155413	4156716	I think we have an email or two.
4157798	4158218	We have one.
4158539	4163448	Alright, one email and then we'll get to any of your questions in chat or otherwise.
4163849	4165773	So let's get to Loki.
4167796	4173407	So you know how Nintendo has their news app that they put out?
4173674	4177941	Well, they're trying to prevent people from sharing the news from the news app.
4178061	4183569	They will actually black out the screen with the data, so preventing you from sharing the stuff.
4185472	4187075	I mean, there are ways around that.
4187195	4190180	And why wouldn't they want you to share the news?
4191241	4193245	So you'd have to go to the app, I guess.
4193265	4194066	Because it's the paywall.
4194967	4195408	Silly.
4195428	4195909	It's silly.
4196450	4197591	It's fucking stupid.
4197692	4200276	I mean, I understand that people need to get paid.
4200476	4200576	Yeah.
4202564	4228099	I understand people need to get paid, but...
4228433	4229515	Windows or whatever.
4230397	4231399	It's dumb.
4231499	4239895	It's just a dumb hurdle to get through for the casual person that's excited about your games and wants to share their excitement with other people.
4240517	4242240	Can't have that.
4242305	4244427	God forbid, lock it all down.
4244668	4250254	You know, and it's just an example, again, about this industry isn't transparent enough sometimes.
4250274	4252116	And it gets extraordinarily frustrating.
4252136	4260645	And I understand the reason for some secrecy, but like the lack of transparency on some of the decisions that are made is just, you know, fine, you leave it to us to make up.
4261085	4264829	When you're not transparent, you let us fill in the gaps and we're going to just say you're ignorant.
4264849	4267232	That's where we land with this particular headline.
4267632	4268413	So this is...
4269862	4272185	It would be great to have more insight, but we're never going to get it.
4273007	4273307	All right.
4273948	4279596	I do want to sort of remind people here at the end, Summer Game Fest is next week.
4279616	4292815	But we have a lot of stuff that's coming that's not just that main event that's happening on Friday at 2 Pacific, 5 Eastern from the Keelyverse, which, by the way, we are going to co-stream here on VOG Network.
4292795	4322751	usually I can't do these types of things because they're during the day for me but I'm doing some different things at work and I'm going to be working a new schedule where I'm actually going to have Friday off so by a nice coincidence I am able to do this co-stream with Bobby Blackwolf so we're actually going to be watching the Summer Game Fest Keeley information I'm expecting it's probably going to be like four hours it's probably something ridiculously long but that is you know something to look forward to but that's not all there are a lot of other
4322731	4325214	Game Showcase is coming.
4325234	4330181	June 7th at 1pm, we have Green Games Showcase.
4331142	4335388	Shining a light on environmental issues and how to contribute to real world causes.
4335408	4339774	I guess a little bit of PSA type information for the gaming industry.
4340735	4346443	I'm curious if maybe it'll get into anything about how to make the games industry more green, but we'll see.
4346592	4348915	We also have Frosty Games Fest.
4349676	4355002	I think the joke is it is currently winter in Australia and New Zealand.
4355463	4363412	And so we have Frosty Game Fest that's going to be focusing on Australia and New Zealand types of games and things that have been built in those areas.
4363432	4366276	That will be on June 8th at 9 a.m.
4366536	4367357	Australian.
4367477	4369500	I think it's Australian Eastern Standard Time.
4369520	4370681	I think it's Sydney's time zone.
4370701	4372043	So AEST.
4372063	4373004	That's 11 a.m.
4373024	4374085	New Zealand.
4374065	4376928	We also have the Xbox Games Showcase.
4377089	4379992	That is going to be Sunday, June 8th.
4380012	4381614	So the morning before our next show.
4381634	4382455	That's a 10 a.m.
4382475	4384137	Pacific though, so that's nice and early.
4384157	4388783	But of course they want the worldwide views because that's more the evening time in Europe when that is going to air.
4389624	4394930	We also have the Southeast Asian Games Showcase is also happening.
4395110	4397373	I don't currently see the date and time on that.
4397393	4399836	I believe it's June 7th.
4399816	4404307	at, what time?
4404387	4405610	I don't have a time on that.
4405631	4406593	Oh, I found it, 3 p.m.
4406613	4407154	Eastern.
4407174	4408899	And that's all on a YouTube live stream for that.
4409440	4414934	We also have the Latin American Games Showcase, June 7th at 11 a.m.
4414954	4417420	50 indie games in that one.
4417400	4422505	We have the Women-Led Games Showcase coming back for its second year.
4422925	4425127	That will be June 7th at 10 a.m.
4425288	4429532	on Twitch and YouTube, also through IGN and GameSpot.
4429912	4430993	So you check that out.
4431013	4441283	By the way, that same team is also doing a Steam sale that is going to start June 6th and run through the 13th, also to support Women-Led Games.
4442064	4443285	So lots and lots.
4443345	4445567	We also have a Devolver Direct event
4445767	4448550	I know Loki loves his Devolver Directs and many of you do.
4448991	4449872	That will be there.
4449892	4450613	They get weird.
4450733	4452234	June 6th at 8.
4452595	4458081	Nothing is ever going to be the year that they put out a playable game that was like E3 Walking Simulator.
4458101	4458542	It was great.
4458922	4460384	June 6th at 8 p.m.
4460404	4471977	Eastern for that Day of the Devs will also be indie games, of course, will be happening June 6th.
4471957	4474445	7pm Eastern for that.
4475288	4476271	Busy, busy, busy.
4476391	4478659	I think I hit all the big ones that I know of.
4479040	4481528	Are we going to get a surprise Nintendo Direct maybe?
4482132	4483775	I wouldn't hold your breath.
4484236	4492572	I feel like because the system's coming out, you might get one announcement or two to remind people it's out, but I don't know.
4492772	4500486	I almost worry a Nintendo Direct would be bad news because it could be a price increase because of everything going on now that the pre-orders have been filled.
4500566	4502470	So I don't know.
4502737	4521204	and don't count anything out I suppose but um yeah there'd be a lot of other noise going on right now I feel like if Nintendo just kind of waits a week they could really take the narrative next week you know what I mean so we'll see uh one more direct uh sorry a wholesome direct June 7th at 12 p.m.
4521224	4525470	I know they've had these uh games before these are your cozy games
4525450	4548724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4548704	4549626	I love it.
4549947	4552772	So, yeah, it's not just the big Keeley event.
4552792	4555237	There are all of these indie things happening.
4556199	4560568	Or, you know, maybe more like, you know, not quite AAA studios, but, you know, the next tier.
4561229	4564275	Also making announcements through these things.
4564296	4565618	So that's big.
4565638	4568745	Dark Tootsie is saying Nintendo will be at Summer Game Fest.
4569025	4569987	Well, I mean...
4570523	4575388	Why wouldn't they want to remind people the Switch 2 is out?
4575668	4578411	And maybe there could be a little stealth drop they do.
4578871	4582054	Maybe an update to the classic game library or something.
4582074	4585357	Maybe there's your Pokemon idea that came up earlier in the show.
4585397	4587580	Although I think that would get saved for the Pokemon Direct.
4587860	4588420	But you never know.
4588761	4594366	There could be just something a little... We're going to give away that Nintendo Tour for free.
4594526	4595327	Haha, just kidding.
4595347	4596328	They're not going to do that.
4597473	4599740	Alright, let's get to the listener roundtable.
4599820	4601325	Every week we encourage your emails.
4601405	4604696	Participate at OrangeOnRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
4605358	4608006	And we'll go to DarkSakura for the reading of the email.
4608813	4611035	The reading of the email.
4612397	4614279	Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi.
4614740	4616562	I just wanted to say thanks for the well wishes.
4616602	4617062	Doing better.
4617162	4618844	First night back from the hospital.
4619044	4620786	Anyway, enough about that.
4620806	4624670	I am really enjoying this team deck a lot more than I thought I would.
4625271	4628214	And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask and I'll do my best to answer.
4628675	4630177	I just wanted to say thanks for the show.
4630337	4632799	And as always, I look forward to the show every Sunday.
4632819	4634041	Stay awesome and game on.
4634681	4636103	Sincerely yours, Mishi.
4636690	4641917	Yeah, Mishi had a little bit of medical ups and downs this week that I saw on Blue Sky.
4641937	4643879	So I'm really glad you're in chat.
4643899	4646182	You're with us tonight and chatting away.
4646222	4648906	So I know that means you're feeling good enough to be here.
4649006	4651710	So I appreciate seeing you and having your presence here tonight.
4652230	4654073	And congratulations on the Steam Deck.
4654093	4655715	I don't have any questions because I also have one.
4655975	4659660	Yeah, my question is, have you tried the adventure of sideloading emulators yet?
4660703	4662285	If you need some tips, I'll help.
4663447	4671418	There are some things that make it easier, but you're going to want to read the instructions unlike what I did because I got lost.
4671438	4671999	And you know why?
4672059	4673982	Because you need to read the fucking instructions.
4674423	4675264	And I didn't do that.
4675344	4676165	So I own it.
4677106	4678088	I own it.
4678108	4679810	But yeah.
4679830	4684517	Oh, Mish says is in chat and says, I would have found a way to watch the show for the emergency room.
4686370	4689057	I appreciate that, but please take care of your health first.
4689318	4691022	That's why this is a podcast.
4691042	4693368	It's really okay if you're not here live.
4693609	4698823	There's many people that have never been here live that have been listening to this show for a very long time.
4698843	4700728	So we appreciate all of them as well.
4700748	4702793	So thank you, thank you.
4702773	4703774	Alright, well thanks for the email.
4703834	4708858	If you want to send us an email in a future week, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send the email.
4709779	4716465	We also, at this part of the show, enjoy taking your calls in our green room at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
4716865	4721369	And I would encourage you to join our Discord and talk with us throughout the week over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
4721409	4732138	A lot of stories and a lot of the insight I kind of get on how y'all are feeling about it is because I read our Orange Lounge Radio channel and our general channel and the other stuff on the Discord channel throughout the week.
4732118	4739568	The admins have a no ping philosophy on Discord because we know so many Discords ping you every five minutes.
4739649	4740790	So we've made a decision.
4740810	4741331	We don't ping.
4741712	4745176	So we have a channel if you want to see all the pingable announcements.
4745256	4747960	There's an announcements channel when new shows and things drop.
4747980	4751325	But we will let you choose when you want to look at that.
4751305	4754208	But otherwise, yeah, so if you're worried about that, just join.
4754709	4757832	Come join the party with us on Discord, vognetwork.com.
4758312	4761195	And we can take your calls like we're going to do right now.
4761215	4763518	I'm sure this person wanted to call in last week.
4763538	4765300	I really want to talk to this person tonight.
4765320	4769404	So let's go to the telephone lines, the modern ones, and say hello.
4769464	4770385	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4770405	4770746	Who's this?
4773148	4775951	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's the Ranma.
4776271	4777212	Hey, Ranma, good to see you.
4777232	4777853	How are you?
4779689	4781154	Good, how about y'all?
4781435	4782619	Good, welcome back.
4782760	4784747	I recognize your shirt.
4784767	4787657	That's a shirt from Super Nintendo World, isn't it?
4788110	4788991	Yes, it is.
4789913	4792156	In the extra large, I just put it on a minute ago.
4792196	4796001	I'm like, oh, it's a lot roomier than I thought it would be.
4796302	4798645	Oh, that's a different design.
4798786	4808339	So to describe for our podcast listeners, he's wearing a green Luigi t-shirt, and it has, I'm assuming, Luigi written in Japanese below that.
4808680	4815670	But it's mostly green, but imagine more of a tank top sports shirt type of fit, but then the extended sleeves are blue.
4815886	4833827	Which I think is interesting I know, I know, but the extended sleeves are blue The green is in that shape of a sports shirt I know, I just love the way that looks It looks like one of the VOG Network shirts we used to have That I really liked And there's also a Mario version too, which is really cool Yeah, and I have the Bowser hat I have a Bowser hat around here Actually, wait, I think it's right over here
4834465	4835707	But here's the funny thing.
4836428	4840094	See, I bought my Bowser hat from when I was there, yeah.
4840795	4842478	Here's the interesting thing.
4842498	4846124	The hat that I'm wearing, it is a Luigi bucket hat.
4846144	4851833	I got this hat at a convention earlier this year, and I said, this is going to be my Japan hat.
4851813	4859264	For two straight weeks, I had people on the street just point and go, Luigi or Mario.
4859524	4864552	I've had tourists just come by and say the hat is awesome and give me high fives.
4864932	4868658	I am in random people's selfies with this hat.
4868678	4871642	People thought I got it from Universal, but I didn't.
4871662	4877230	But when you go to Universal, they have a reversible bucket hat for Mario and Luigi.
4877817	4878478	I love that.
4878959	4879460	I love that.
4879540	4881903	That's so funny that you ended up in selfies and stuff, too.
4881923	4882504	That's so cool.
4883946	4891137	Apparently, I have a group of friends from online and some of the games I used to play that I'm following the Instagram stories of their adventures in Japan.
4891198	4892039	It looks like they're having such fun.
4892419	4895825	And one of them said, we just got interviewed by a third grade class.
4896686	4900652	So I guess people will really just walk right up to you.
4901358	4907157	There are a lot of people at Narita and Haneda that will just interview tourists that are coming in.
4907317	4907558	Wow.
4908200	4908602	That's neat.
4910026	4912093	So, how is Japan?
4913002	4934655	was great now here's the thing I really wanted to call in while I was running around Osaka and Akihabara we just figured you were asleep the gaming stores but here's the thing 99% of the gaming stores open around 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning which is around the time you guys sign off sure
4935918	4940185	No, we figured, and I, you know, last week I was like, well, Ranma said he wanted to call in, but you know what?
4940205	4944112	He's probably having fun and has better things to do than talk to us right now.
4944152	4944974	We'll hear from him later.
4945014	4946496	So I figured you wouldn't call in.
4946556	4946937	It's fine.
4947839	4948580	Bull and shit.
4948600	4949481	Come on now.
4949602	4958517	Let me tell you, the first week there, my entire sleep schedule was thrown off by a few hours, which I was perfectly okay with because I woke up around...
4959374	4965715	between 5 and 6, showered, relaxed, went to the Denny's across the street and had a damn good breakfast.
4965996	4966819	That's what I did.
4968571	4969051	That's great.
4969192	4970953	I really want to go to Japan.
4971994	4977479	You know, I've been saying this for a long time, but like the closer I get to 50, the more I'm like, I just need to fucking go.
4977499	4986768	So I think that's, I don't know if it's going to happen next year because Alan and I are still trying to plan a Europe cruise, but maybe the year, maybe for my 50th birthday, who fucking knows.
4986788	4989110	But I would just, I would really just love to go, to be honest.
4989130	4989731	It'd be so fun.
4990872	4991112	Go.
4991372	4995256	Just do not go between May and September.
4995696	4996637	Okay.
4996820	4998482	because it is sweltering hot.
4998842	5008514	I discovered that the hard way and thanks to one of my friends, I had to stop into Don Quixote and pick up these deodorant body wipes called Gatsby.
5008674	5013780	Gatsby also makes the hair products I use, the moving rubber.
5014541	5015242	Oh yes, yes.
5015382	5016704	These are a godsend.
5018947	5021730	They also sell those at Oto's in town.
5023162	5029031	I'm sure you're probably going to do more of a full recap on your show, Anime Jam Session, on Tuesday.
5029051	5032877	But what were some of the highlights of your trip, especially gaming-related things?
5032917	5033919	Like Nintendo World.
5033939	5035160	How was Nintendo World in Japan?
5037324	5047920	I saw the photo of you trying to get into the cart, and unfortunately, too bad, puffy American boy, no ride for you.
5048643	5055514	I still have fun because I was mostly there more for the ambience and the environment.
5055534	5056275	It was fun.
5056375	5058299	You really didn't miss the ride.
5058579	5059681	It's okay.
5060282	5063427	It's cool, but you'll be okay, Ranma.
5063447	5064308	It's okay.
5064328	5065450	I know.
5065470	5072842	One of my friends, she actually got me a personalized power band, so it was my name and Katakana on it, so that's cool.
5072862	5073423	Oh, I love that.
5073643	5073884	Okay.
5074044	5074144	Okay.
5074664	5103523	so I did try to do the whole three keys thing but we ran out of time for a small area Super Nintendo World is there are some pretty long lines and stuff so I did do one ride there I did the Detective Conan 4D Theater Adventure which was kind of fun I would have never thought all the different rides different movies over there well if you're into Jaws there's still the Jaws theme area that's still there nice
5104330	5131232	we're gonna need a bigger boat but um I did get some gaming stuff, not a lot I was trying to track down a couple of video games but a couple of the super potatoes I went to didn't have them but I will say this you will find tons of retro consoles floating around if you're looking to save a few dollars if you don't want a Japanese console I can take that
5131938	5140069	I did stop by the Capcom Cafe and Mako-chan asked for a special request of something.
5140529	5143813	So, I assume we've all played Resident Evil, right?
5143833	5145035	At some point in our life, yeah.
5145776	5150282	And you know how the herbs will give you, restore your energy and abilities and so forth?
5153186	5158272	How about the herbs as teas?
5158292	5159313	Oh, that's a cute idea.
5159354	5159734	Yeah.
5160136	5160917	That's a cute idea.
5161038	5161398	Okay.
5161418	5164303	Green, blue, red, and lemon.
5164684	5165245	I mean, yellow.
5165265	5167328	So I picked these up for her.
5167508	5170453	So now you can have literally herbal tea.
5171014	5171455	I love it.
5174140	5177345	Now, I went and picked up a couple of some albums.
5177786	5184077	Now, I would have to say I have seen the Super Mario Brothers movie at least five times.
5184257	5185519	Once in theaters.
5186326	5215489	three times streaming and once on Blu-ray I actually have a CD version and all the limited edition Blu-rays that each retailer was putting out because that's how much I loved it so I feel you on the whole Mass Effect 3 thing so while I was in Japan and I was popping through some CDs and stuff like that and I apologize for the loud sound because the mic is right here so I picked up what did we talk about
5216347	5219351	Oh, I picked up a lot more CDs than I thought I did.
5219372	5222056	But, um... Oh, that was my controller.
5222296	5222616	Oh, well.
5223117	5223578	That's fine.
5223838	5224539	I have plenty more.
5225100	5234174	So, I picked up... There is a series of remix CDs, anime CDs, that came out in the early 2000s called Power Power Max.
5234254	5238240	So I end up finding... Yeah, I know those.
5238260	5239802	Oh my god.
5239842	5243147	And one of them was only 300 yen.
5243212	5245855	I swear to God, one of those CDs you held up I've seen before.
5245915	5247156	I think Jamie had it.
5247516	5249639	Yeah.
5250359	5250920	Hold on.
5250940	5252842	Let me make sure because I think those are the ones I have.
5253002	5257527	There's like a... Yeah, I have like a box set of those.
5257567	5258167	I've seen that.
5259949	5262212	I have the Tatsunoko one too.
5262812	5263933	Oh, there's a Tatsunoko one?
5264013	5265054	I did not know about that.
5265114	5267056	The Tatsunoko one is like 10 years old.
5269879	5272442	Yeah, and those are the four that I picked up.
5272540	5280748	and while I was there, and I think this one you'll appreciate, Jamie, I grabbed this.
5280768	5282409	Oh, cool.
5282549	5283330	Very cool.
5283430	5285392	Describe what you're holding up for the podcast, folks.
5285532	5287814	I was getting to that.
5287834	5296302	Well, I'm holding up as a single to the song Equal Romance by the group Coco, which is that first ending, no, second ending theme to Ranma 1.5.
5297864	5299425	Yep, that is classic right there.
5300066	5301147	And that was only...
5303371	5305093	Wow, I didn't even pay them 700 yen.
5307657	5308358	That's not bad.
5308678	5313645	Because I mean, CDs are really expensive, but the market for CDs is still pretty booming from what I understand.
5314366	5320074	I mean, I did pick up both Persona 5 soundtracks for a friend because she's really into it.
5320094	5321836	But I did get this.
5321977	5326262	I did pick up the Super Mario Brothers movie Japanese soundtrack.
5326403	5327244	I just had to.
5327724	5328485	That's really cool.
5328505	5328906	Nice.
5329409	5335415	I wish I could have gotten that Firebomber one, but I do have a bunch of Firebomber CDs already.
5335475	5338918	Ranmari in chat is asking what store this all came from.
5340960	5349068	The Super Mario CD came from the Surugaya in Akihabara, which is like right by the Pachinko place.
5349689	5354413	And that's where I found a couple of the Max CDs.
5354433	5355634	And that's Equal Romance.
5355654	5357256	Yeah, that's where I actually found them all at.
5357978	5360281	And I went over to Animate.
5360321	5364067	They have like a little section for CD, for gaming soundtracks and CDs.
5364107	5365989	I think it's called Grate or Grato.
5366650	5371517	And I went back and I picked up the Super Mario Brothers movie soundtrack on vinyl.
5373359	5374481	That's incredible.
5375563	5375903	Love it.
5376083	5380329	I'm like, I'm walking by and I saw, I'm like, I have it.
5380810	5382793	I said, I'll come back for it.
5382813	5384475	And I came back and I picked it up.
5385147	5390352	This is what I got for my... These are the bags that you get at Universal, which is kind of cool.
5391133	5393015	It's very similar to what they give here, yeah.
5393035	5394236	It's cute.
5395077	5404988	One of my friends... On a side note, one of my friends... Her favorite Sanrio character is one of the rarest ones to find stuff for, Choco Cat.
5405008	5412235	I just happened to be in a Mega Don Quixote in Nagoya, and I found this purse for her, so...
5414915	5433362	I find ChocoCat stuff at Daiso out here a lot.
5434085	5441314	See, that does not surprise me, because I found a lot of ChocoCat stuff at Universal when I went back in December.
5441795	5451086	But because ChocoCat's not that popular in Japan, you're not going to find much on that character, which was kind of shocking that I found stuff.
5451106	5455912	Yeah, I keep looking for Little Twin Stars stuff, because that's my jam.
5455932	5459957	I saw some stuff here in Little Twin Stars, um...
5460578	5488881	Hmm.
5489367	5491170	Well, Ranma, when are you planning your next trip?
5492572	5503287	Well, I'm actually thinking next year because this time around, I have a few more friends in Japan and I want to spend more time hanging out with them because there's a few I have not seen in years.
5503648	5516286	Because one of the things that happened with my trip this year was the friend that came with me was, this was like her related birthday gift from her parents and the trip was my birthday gift to myself, so we ran into a lot of
5516384	5518009	You want to do a lot of culture stuff.
5518390	5520175	I want to do a lot of weeb stuff.
5520195	5525249	So there was a lot of compromises made here and there and some stuff had to get cut off.
5526393	5527255	Sure.
5527910	5532334	Yeah, I have at least one friend moving to Japan, maybe two in the next year.
5532374	5534296	Of course, it's a big country.
5534336	5537499	They may not be in the same place, but they have the transit to get you there.
5537539	5541262	Oh my god, I love the transit system.
5541323	5543945	I have three different tap cards.
5544686	5548389	I think there's six different tap cards, but they all work one with each other.
5548449	5551392	It's just certain areas have certain ones.
5552173	5556837	I thought that the Suika was the major one for just about everything.
5556968	5562216	Well, technically it is, but I have a Suica, I have a Pasmo, and an Iokoka card.
5562256	5564159	But they all work one and the same.
5564219	5567363	It's just that different regions promote certain different ones.
5569066	5572711	You know what I want to do when I get to go?
5573072	5576216	I want to do what I am dubbing the Ekibentor.
5577759	5578520	The Ekibentor?
5579421	5585490	Where I eat at every train station I can and have their signature bento.
5587715	5594924	Jamie, riding the Shinkansen with a bento and a drink was top tier for me.
5598028	5602734	Now, SJ100Bat was asking about games.
5602754	5604076	Okay.
5604096	5610263	I will tell you the same thing when it comes to looking for games as is looking for, like, anime merch and so forth.
5612867	5613908	I may...
5614563	5620950	You know what?
5625455	5640030	Huh?
5641141	5641982	No, what would you say, Jamie?
5642002	5642343	Go on, please.
5642603	5653077	I was going to say, people would actually hate, I think, going with me, because one of the big things on my, like, bucket list is the Shikoku Pilgrimage.
5653097	5655040	The Shikoku Pilgrimage?
5655060	5663051	It's an island of about 88 temples, and you walk the island and get stamped at each of the temples that you go to.
5663131	5667758	It's a couple of days of a hike, and you can sometimes stay at some of the different shrines.
5669760	5670962	I don't know where I put it.
5671972	5674575	is probably my bad.
5675196	5680844	The closest thing to stamping I did was you can get stamped at the different train stations as you travel.
5680864	5683027	Yeah, I want to do that too.
5683047	5683928	That was fun.
5684409	5687713	Some of the stampers are outside, others are inside.
5688013	5692579	If you don't see them, if you ask the station master, they'll tell you where to go.
5693761	5695864	When it comes to deals, I'm going to tell you this right now.
5696965	5700510	If you see something good in Akihabara, write it down.
5701081	5703704	Hmm.
5703844	5726211	Wow.
5726731	5727492	I will wait.
5727512	5728553	That's not bad.
5728573	5731816	Went to Nakano Broadway, found it sealed for $1,680.
5731856	5732136	Wow.
5732636	5734978	That's even better.
5735799	5737501	Because here's the thing.
5738221	5755397	When you're online and you see like these awesome T-Mode style, all these anime figures that are going for $30 and $40 and so forth, understand that's two to three times the retail price in Japan because it's covering cost of shipping and so forth.
5755677	5756738	And here...
5756718	5759161	These figures are rare.
5759181	5759942	These are unique.
5759982	5762005	These are one of a kind.
5762025	5763968	In Japan, it's a dime a dozen.
5764228	5768434	These are basically Tonka Toys in Japan.
5768834	5772339	I don't want to say Tonka Toys, but basically that's what it is.
5772880	5777446	Figures I've paid, I was going to pay anywhere between $30 and $40.
5777566	5782693	I paid no more than $11 to $10 to $15 a pop.
5782713	5782793	Hmm.
5785591	5787173	That's easier to eat cheaper.
5789034	5789174	Mm-hmm.
5789194	5795981	And if you're looking for rare games, yes, start in Akihabara, but go to the book-offs.
5796221	5799825	Check for the book-off super bazaars, the book-off pluses.
5800165	5804409	Those will have a larger selection of retro games.
5806591	5808013	The out-of-the-way animates.
5808113	5815140	There's an animate in a mall in Kyoto that had tons of Famicom games there that you can go through.
5815400	5815480	Ooh.
5816928	5822876	I'd love to get a Famicom disc system at some point, although I imagine finding discs that still work could be a challenge.
5823257	5824739	Well, usually no.
5825059	5829766	I was at a book off where they were selling a lot of the Famicom disc games.
5829806	5830367	Oh, that's cool.
5831468	5835173	It's a book off in Ikebukuro near Sunshine City.
5835834	5837957	They had like a whole display of them.
5838224	5845772	And if you go to a Super Potato, I promise you, you will find one of them selling a Famicom Disk System to pick up.
5845792	5849936	And I would say you're probably going to spend no more than $100 on it, give or take.
5850296	5851077	$150 tops.
5851518	5851738	Yeah.
5852899	5854821	Yeah, Dr. Seuss says be careful of the drive belts.
5854841	5860707	Yeah, it would be a pain to transport, but I think a neat collector's item.
5860727	5861047	True.
5861828	5866493	I will say that I did have to pick up a Sega Saturn for a friend because he moved to Germany and...
5867755	5872541	Movers, moving his stuff, they damaged the Saturn, so I got him another one.
5873883	5881752	US conversion, 92 bucks, and I think it was like $50 to ship to Germany, so it wasn't so bad.
5881772	5883615	Alright, well Ranma, it sounds like you had a great trip.
5883835	5889762	I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show here, but yeah, I enjoyed hearing about your adventures and making me a little jealous, I gotta be honest.
5890623	5893527	Well, tell you what, I have a friend named Rose that
5893962	5896992	When you and Alan are ready, come out, talk to us.
5897193	5899521	We will help you plan this so you can have a great time.
5899982	5900444	Seriously.
5900544	5901527	Alright, I'm into it.
5901648	5902170	I'm into it.
5903093	5904598	And here's one thing.
5904718	5905722	I will have a couple things.
5905942	5906183	One,
5907209	5911116	You don't need a lot of cash on hand because so many places take card.
5911536	5918028	So if you find yourself doing big shopping, just put it on your card, do the US equivalent, save a few dollars.
5918308	5920532	You might pay two bucks on a $200 purchase.
5920892	5923377	No, certain cards will even do the translation for free.
5923417	5924519	I've been able to do it in Mexico.
5924679	5927804	I bought cheap fucking hats in Mexico that would cost me $80 here.
5927824	5928846	It cost me like $15.
5929407	5931471	They're probably knockoffs, but I can't tell the difference.
5931491	5932272	So who cares?
5932437	5932937	There you go.
5933238	5939043	And also, if you don't need specialty like body soap and lotions and stuff, just use what they have in the hotel.
5939344	5947592	But I promise you, your skin is going to be a lot cleaner, a lot nicer, and if you have dye in your hair, it's going to kind of come out.
5947752	5948993	Well, I don't have air, so it's fine.
5951055	5951375	No, no.
5951635	5955619	You know, I am going to be going at all the skincare stores.
5955639	5956680	Oh, yes.
5956700	5959303	There's just no ifs, ands, or buts about that.
5959323	5960444	Alan loves that stuff, too.
5960564	5961685	So, yeah.
5961901	5964840	y'all are gonna go into overload when you see all
5965698	5971967	Where I'm staying in Akihabara is at least five to six drug and beauty stores, like literally right there.
5971987	5974871	If not outside, we go down into the shopping mall.
5975612	5978756	And that was like one of the other highlights of my trip.
5978776	5984124	I love the fact that I'm going through these subway malls and these malls and it's not dead.
5984364	5988129	There are people walking around shopping and enjoying themselves.
5988530	5992195	I felt like a kid in the 90s going through the malls, okay?
5992736	5992836	Yeah.
5992816	6007855	also I want to go to the thrift stores in Shibuya that sell the resell designer stuff oh you don't have to go to Shibuya oh no there's like five specific stores there I want to go to
6008543	6016894	I was going to say, because there's like six in the Kyoto shopping arcade in the hotel that I stayed by, and it's just, yeah.
6017534	6019116	And I did get some clothes.
6019216	6025544	I got myself a nice kimono for, you know, to wear during the winter, and a couple of jinbeis for the summertime, so I'm happy about that.
6026746	6026986	Nice.
6027687	6028408	That'd be comfortable.
6028692	6032456	Alright, Ranma, well we look forward to hearing more on Tuesday on Anime Jam Session.
6033658	6034559	It'll be next Tuesday.
6034579	6039164	This Tuesday I'm still resting, relaxing, and putting my notes together properly for a good show.
6039224	6039804	That's fair.
6039865	6040685	Alright, next Tuesday.
6041546	6049515	That and I'm still in the process of divvying stuff up and mailing stuff out and Jamie, expect a package in the next week or two.
6050396	6050496	What?
6050516	6051438	Oh my god, thank you.
6051638	6055442	You're the best.
6055582	6056723	Thanks for that, Ranma.
6057124	6057404	Take care.
6057444	6058125	Have a good one.
6058780	6059341	Bye!
6059361	6083472	Bye!
6084447	6111906	Amazing stuff.
6111886	6114269	But yeah, well, and he deserves it.
6114289	6115571	40 years in business.
6116733	6116973	Yeah.
6117174	6118115	And it's been a staple.
6118135	6119677	People have grown up with this place.
6119697	6120739	Earned that retirement.
6121680	6128650	Yeah, it's just a little bit more of a local thing, but it's such a big part of, you know, Bay Area and Northern California.
6129251	6135420	So enjoy your retirement, Onishi-san.
6135921	6136482	You deserve it.
6138144	6138525	All right.
6138605	6141589	Well, Loki, let me check in with you for any other last minute stories.
6142463	6144066	All right.
6144086	6148975	Well, I guess we're just all eagerly awaiting the Switch 2 and Summer Game Fest this week.
6149516	6151339	So next week is going to be a huge show.
6151379	6153342	We got a lot of ground to cover.
6153362	6155466	So we hope to see you here next week.
6155506	6159834	Except, DarkSakura, you're not here because of a conflict with your ballet stuff.
6161016	6161958	It's my ballet recital.
6162158	6164422	Yeah, but that's certainly understandable.
6164442	6167087	But we will hold down the fort while you're gone.
6168130	6188265	I'll tell you what, wish me no, in ballet you don't say break a leg, you say merd yes, it means shit yes, well they say that a lot in Claire Obscure too, so anyway I wanted to say thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio if you enjoyed what you heard here, tell a friend or two about the show
6188245	6192131	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6192511	6198060	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found the show goes an awful long way.
6198080	6200964	So thank you for helping us to get the word out.
6200984	6204489	So with that, Jamie, Mass Effect coming up.
6204650	6205791	Any last thoughts?
6205811	6207173	Yep, I'm moving some things around.
6207995	6215586	After Recital, I'm actually going to be changing one of my Friday nights to a Dead by Daylight night called Friday in the Fog.
