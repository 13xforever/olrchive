9869	13755	Look, to be completely honest, I'm too busy being a porter to write anything witty this week.
13955	19123	But I will toot my own horn for putting Mind's Eye Management on blast last episode and I didn't even get paid for it.
19143	22629	And I'm at least 93% sure I'm not a bot nor operated by one.
23170	25734	People get paid to generate news-relevant noise?
25754	26976	How did I miss that memo?
28618	33105	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about two weeks in gaming news.
33386	36130	Beep boop beep boop beep, where every gamer has a voice.
39822	58708	Thank you, Jason Bond.
58688	62855	Oh yeah, it's me.
66201	77541	Happy 23rd birthday.
78955	81538	Yeah, 23rd.
81638	82259	That's right.
82399	84642	It's Resident Evil, the 23rd birthday.
84762	88546	No, we turned 23 while we were gone.
88707	91850	This show started June 23rd of 2002.
92731	95074	And here we are 23 years later.
95315	95895	That's right.
96216	100020	Just like the 23rd Magus and all the consequences he brought this show when he was with us.
100040	101362	That's a deep cut.
101382	102623	I'm sorry to any of our listeners.
102643	103364	That's a deep cut.
103384	104205	We used to have this guy.
104345	106107	Actually, you're still friends with him.
106127	107369	Well, we're all friends with him.
107389	108070	You see him more.
108090	108270	Oh, yeah.
108250	134562	I'm on a work thing in San Diego right now.
134542	160498	23rd Magus 23rd Magus
161677	163560	Booked and blessed, as they say.
163580	163900	All right.
164281	165203	Also booked and blessed.
165343	167366	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
168287	168748	Hello.
168768	169249	Hi, Loki.
169289	169670	How are you?
170731	171152	I'm all right.
171653	172314	We're back.
172334	173456	We were gone last week.
173656	177422	I was at a little show called Southern Fried Gaming Expo out in Atlanta.
177742	178664	There was a lot of fun.
178684	180527	I'll tell you more about it during my gaming week.
180547	184613	But you, Mr. Loki, went on a family trip because I saw the pictures.
184711	187276	You went down to San Diego San Diego How was that?
187296	206652	Yeah, it was a little too early for TwitchCon, unfortunately Yeah, well, you can always go back Not this year I'm not going back this year They were doing a fire sale earlier, I noticed They were like 10% off tickets I'm still kind of on the fence I kind of want to go If you buy it, please, please, please use my referral link
206918	218792	I just can't swing that kind of money to do that again this year after taking a trip to San Diego just last week.
218872	221075	So yeah, I'm okay.
222196	225180	I'll just feel the FOMO out here, I guess.
225460	227863	Is TwitchCon the week of the 10th, 11th, and 12th?
229615	255218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
255198	259362	I have to make sure that Hubby got our pre-reg in for California Extreme.
259402	261043	If not, we're just going to pay when we get there.
261183	264006	Now that I might actually go to this year.
264026	265507	I'm actually free that weekend.
265967	270912	I have a friend here locally who develops for games and has never been.
270932	273154	And I was like, you would have so much fun at this show, my friend.
273574	275516	So I, in fact, I need to text him.
275536	280740	I haven't talked to him in like a week, but I need to text him and be like, hey, you need to keep this weekend clear for me because we're going to go to California Extreme and you're going to have fun.
281181	281961	Mandatory fun.
282542	283703	So...
283683	310618	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
310598	334547	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
334527	355270	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
355250	366289	I think there are definite differences between the two now, even though maybe at its core it's hobbyists and enthusiasts bringing their stuff all to one place so the rest of the fans in the area can have a good time.
367010	368813	At the end of the day, that's what both shows are.
369995	373020	Are you going to take any tables to California Extreme, Jamie?
373040	373842	That's kind of a track.
374002	374583	We never do.
375084	376927	I thought I would ask.
377027	378870	I mean, that's a drive.
379511	380633	It is, yeah.
381288	390140	And then we just do, if we're going to bring anything to anywhere, we do a Golden State Pinball Festival.
390380	390561	Yeah.
390581	392263	Because it's like in Lodi.
392463	393344	Yeah, Lodi's real close.
393364	397310	Well, you know, this was the year that we had the Portal prototype.
397830	398832	Yes, yes.
398852	400093	Yeah, I remember that.
400113	400995	You didn't come play.
401315	401796	I know.
402977	406162	Do you have a Dungeons & Dragons machine?
406182	406382	No.
406682	406983	Damn.
407523	410147	Right now, we don't have anything big on our radar.
410498	411565	That machine was so good.
411585	413598	I got to play that at Southern Fright.
413618	414685	It was so good.
415510	417100	Oh, geez.
417232	419615	Wait, why would you ever open the garage door?
419735	422379	Oh, I guess you have to to probably ventilate it in there.
423220	426505	No, we have a wall.
426545	430610	So the reason why I'm asking is... We have to be able to move the tables.
431351	431932	Oh, yeah.
431952	434335	Okay, that makes sense.
434896	437099	Dan and Jamie keep all... Well, not even all.
437119	438180	I can't even say all the pinball tables.
438561	442446	Half the pinball tables are in the garage and the other half are in the dining room.
443658	446387	No, three are in Dan's office.
446527	447791	Three are in the dining room.
447811	449216	The rest are all in the garage.
449236	449918	They're all spread out.
450339	452807	The three in the dining room are always my choice.
452956	453677	Oh, okay.
453757	458643	So it's Theater of Magic, Black Knight 2000, and World Cup.
459845	459945	Yeah.
459965	460446	Good times.
460766	461147	Good times.
462068	462368	All right.
463309	465572	Let's get into some headlines for tonight.
465592	467915	We're going to get in and talk about what's going on in video games.
468075	473462	Since we weren't here last week, I thought we could start by touching on some headlines from last week.
474163	475785	Do you want to do this, Loki, or do you want me to?
475805	477828	I got all the headlines up if you want me to jump in here.
479010	479871	Either way, I don't care.
480211	480972	All right.
480952	483938	Go for it, and I'll touch on anything you missed.
484299	490833	Yeah, so they had the Donkey Kong Bonanza Direct that kind of talked a little bit more about the game.
490853	496024	We got to see Young Pauline, I guess, in there as well.
496004	497566	Looked pretty cool.
497586	502773	Yeah, it definitely helped sell the game for me a little more than I think what we saw previously.
503414	507780	And my coworkers were kind – hello, because I know some of you listen.
509061	513367	My coworkers were kind enough to get me a gift card for Nintendo for my birthday because my birthday was also last week.
514008	516932	And they were kind enough to get me a big –
516912	519536	They pulled together and got me a big Nintendo gift card.
519556	521558	So I was like, I wasn't originally going to get this game.
521939	523862	But now I'm like, well, I got the money.
524002	525704	I might get this game after all.
525784	527186	So that's kind of where I'm at now.
528829	530751	Yeah, so they announced a few things.
531072	533135	Some of the different game modes in there.
533155	535478	So they have one that's like a race to the core.
535898	538442	So you have to just dig down as quickly as you can.
538482	543529	There's another one that basically is like a creative game mode.
543569	546413	Allows you to...
546393	548356	Do like a photo mode or stuff like that.
548396	550319	I know they have like a carving tool.
550520	553525	You get to like carve stuff, which is interesting.
554166	554967	So they've got that.
555808	558232	They announced, of course, that Minecraft.
558393	560196	Are we Minecrafting in our Donkey Kong now?
560296	560877	Kong craft?
561758	562379	Not quite.
562459	563261	Mine Kong?
563441	563541	Yeah.
564415	586474	different collectibles co-op you can play as Pauline if you have you know play two player which is the correct choice honestly because Pauline in Mario Kart World is serving serving blue shells to the person in first place consistently but Pauline is serving in Mario Kart World we love Pauline
587230	590614	Yeah, so yeah, lots of interesting things that they showed off there.
591014	592816	And it is like right around the corner.
593497	596861	It's such a few weeks away, so it looked all right.
597641	609474	Then, of course, we had the news that the process of decompiling the GameCube version of Animal Crossing is almost complete.
609494	612698	So that's going to open it up for a PC port.
612678	614080	Maybe mods.
614100	614841	Oh, God.
614901	615421	Who knows?
615582	616242	Oh, God.
616383	622090	When the modders and PC port get Animal Crossing, Nintendo is going to try to shut that down at every opportunity.
622150	625594	But once it's on the Internet, it will always be on the Internet.
625614	630741	I mean, we have probably more news regarding another game that's also gone through that treatment.
630761	635166	And so far with those versions, they have not shut it down yet.
635186	636468	So, yeah, we'll see.
636548	637369	We'll see.
637872	656978	I don't think Pali is anything like Animal Crossing, really.
657025	659771	I guess, yeah, I guess, I guess.
660373	663861	Fantasy Life has a little more in common with Animal Crossing, but yeah.
664141	669654	But anyway, there's a whole, there's all sorts of like clones of Animal Crossing on Steam and that sort of thing.
669834	671538	So there's always that.
672941	676249	Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see what happens with that.
677444	685036	Usually with some of these decompiling efforts and stuff like that, because they're porting it to PC, it still requires you to have a ROM of it.
685056	698717	So if they don't include the Nintendo ROM and game data with the patch or whatever they create for the ROM to port it to PC or something like that, then they might be in the clear there.
699178	700600	I was wondering how they'd be around that.
700968	703952	They're not really facilitating piracy at that point.
704012	707917	It's like you kind of have to do your own piracy in order to play it.
709379	712583	But yeah, it'll be interesting to see what comes of that.
712724	713885	I think that'll be really crazy.
714005	725961	We have a very important chat comment from our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because we do tape live every Sunday night, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
726242	728865	And Rinmari68k is in chat saying, squeak?
728845	737700	is the interior decoration part of Animal Crossing, but you solve P-Cross puzzles to get furniture and outfits.
737720	739984	Well, I just found Bobby Blackwolf's Game of the Year.
740004	746314	I don't know about y'all, but I think those are like Bobby Blackwolf's two favorite games are Animal Crossing and P-Cross.
746783	752073	I was going to say, and Bobby, you saying TTP and Animal Crossing mods, they didn't need mods to do that.
752113	752935	That's already been a thing.
752955	753676	Yeah, it's already happened.
753857	754358	It's already happened.
754378	756782	There's lots of phallic mushrooms in that game already.
756822	760710	Remember, you could do, you could put whatever you want on those signboards, remember?
761191	767122	Or you could... Because I remember DarkSakura had a big pride flag outside one of her villagers' houses because, you know, ally.
767964	768505	So...
769497	795505	yeah so yeah you can you can do all sorts of things ally well you know it no because it was your your uh one that had all the fitness uh equipment in her basement you were like she's a lesbian she's a lesbian and so you were showing your allyship anyway it was it was it was for Dina anyway sorry Loki yeah there's always time for Animal Crossing jokes
796801	802110	Some other stuff that's kind of interesting, Beat Sabers ended support for PlayStation VR and PlayStation VR 2.
803192	804314	I guess it's fine.
804494	808721	It's basically that they're just not making any more content for it, is what it is.
808741	814230	And considering how old those games are, yeah, that makes sense.
814250	819940	As long as content's not being removed, which I don't think is the case yet, but we'll see.
820342	821984	Um, what else?
822504	826549	Final Fantasy Tactics Remastered are not going to include the PSP War of the Lions content.
827029	828071	That sucks.
828091	828451	Why?
828471	832255	I mean, I know that they had issues with that game in the first place.
832475	835479	So they can sell it to you as DLC later on.
835659	836440	That's why.
836760	838362	Yeah, of course that's why.
838382	845690	They're not saying that, but... Just food for thought on that.
845790	846210	That's all.
846711	847972	Breathing motherfuckers.
848333	848713	Okay.
850155	850315	Um...
850733	876724	by the way with Beat Saber I was distracted by chat but Bobby reminds me because he was getting into it on his show a little bit because he follows VR Meta owns Beat Saber now so why would they want to continue it on PlayStation they want you to get it on Meta they're continuing it on Steam I think to avoid pushback from the modder community which is huge for that game but there's no reason for them to be in business with PlayStation anymore so rip rest in PlayStation
877177	877778	It's alright.
877798	881423	I mean, to be fair, PlayStation forgets they have PlayStation VR half the time anyway.
881443	881963	That is true.
882023	885648	It's not really like they're competing with you, Meta.
886029	892698	If I'm not mistaken, you could still play your PlayStation VR 2 on Steam.
893579	894880	You could play your Beat Saber there.
896302	896603	Right?
897223	902931	So, you just have to connect the leg bones connected to the... Alright, anyway.
903198	904946	What else do you have?
905809	911715	Digital Eclipse bringing Golden T to home arcades, I guess.
911735	912297	Okay.
912935	915499	Or is it home arcades or is it just like a collection?
915779	916380	I don't even know.
916400	920265	It's a collection because Arcade 1-Up has had this in their series for years.
920325	922368	I was going to say Arcade 1-Up had that.
922428	925753	No, this is almost the exact same thing as the Mortal Kombat thing they're doing.
926514	930419	So Digital Eclipse also does those Gold Master series, and this is not in that.
930880	939972	But because Digital Eclipse is so well known for their preservation of game series, like the cult game series, like Mortal Kombat and like Golden Tee,
939952	943637	are getting preserved, I guess, or whatever, in this digital clips collection.
943677	945379	Except, here's the thing.
945399	946801	Who's playing Golden Tee games?
946841	949004	I mean, somebody out there must be, but I'm not.
949104	951287	The extremely old people?
951827	952288	I don't know.
952528	954431	Are y'all in chat?
954691	957875	Are y'all Golden Tee fans out there?
957955	958956	Who's buying the Golden Tee?
959097	960238	I like the golf.
960218	967330	No, Bobby does point out, this is very popular in bar arcades.
967470	972599	You won't see a Street Fighter anymore, you're going to see a Golden Tee machine in the corner.
972699	979510	I do feel like at your Walmart, you always have a big Buck Hunter or whatever in a Golden Tee, so I guess it makes sense.
979743	1007978	that does make sense and it makes sense for like the home arcade stuff I just don't see this as why I need this on PC I don't know maybe people like it who knows I assume it might digital clips has been killing it in the preservation department so I guess maybe I'm just like maybe I'm just being a little selfish and I'm like there are other arcade series I would like those resources to be on first but fine fine golden tea fans have your moment enjoy it and then get to the next one
1010759	1011420	Anyway.
1011440	1021321	I was, yeah, I was like, you know, the one game I had won, I don't think it's Golden Tee, I don't even remember what it was, I just remember they had it at our local Scandia, which was a golf game.
1021401	1027754	I just remember one of the levels, you knocked it off of the roof of a skyscraper, tall building of some sort.
1027774	1029898	Oh yeah, it was like a zany golf type of thing.
1030115	1056139	Yeah, that was fun.
1056119	1057341	is selling pretty well.
1057401	1060205	This is all from a report from the game business.
1060926	1070742	Apparently, most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers, and one third-party publisher said it was below our lowest estimates, despite strong hardware sales.
1070782	1075369	I'm gonna guess that's Square Enix, because Square Enix never hits their sales targets that they have.
1075409	1077292	So it must be Bradley Default's fault.
1077312	1077673	I don't know.
1078233	1079275	But...
1079255	1101955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1102188	1103370	I'm shocked.
1103390	1114144	I'm not shocked, but I'm going to pretend to be shocked that the third-party publishers are acting foolish like this when you are re-releasing all the stuff that was already out there.
1114245	1117209	What did you think was going to happen by re-releasing Street Fighter VI?
1117549	1119071	That game's been out a year.
1119091	1122776	What did you think was going to happen with these Yakuza games that have already been out for a while?
1123357	1124118	Like, hello?
1125300	1127723	Did you all forget the Wii U?
1129390	1134059	In the words of Kathy Bates in Misery, do you all have amnesia?
1134780	1136844	He didn't get out of the cocky duty car.
1138648	1142455	The same thing happened with the Wii U sales.
1144274	1153007	Do you all have amnesia that people are not interested in rebuying the game a year later when they already had it for PlayStation and other stuff?
1153027	1165827	And I think the difference and what's different, what's working with Cyberpunk 2077 is that that game got so blasted when it first came out that most people avoided it.
1165807	1185109	and now sort of in a No Man's Sky Diablo 4 kind of way, people are willing to give that particular game another look because we're talking about an expansion, we're talking about, you know, the game is now in its state that it probably should have been in when it released originally and now it's on the Switch.
1185130	1193299	So I think that's why that game in particular is bucking that trend because most people forgot it already came out before because it wasn't in great shape when it did come out.
1196283	1197368	I'm going to chat.
1197408	1201306	Bobby Blackwolf says the game I'm playing the most on my Switch 2 is a third-party title.
1201326	1202290	Well, dare to be different.
1202310	1203998	Hashtag dare to be different.
1204332	1208016	And I would imagine, I mean, do we have the full sales numbers?
1208036	1210059	I don't even know if we get a real list.
1210299	1214744	But I was going to say, I would bet that... Sorry, there was an autoplay YouTube.
1214764	1215245	I hate that shit.
1215265	1215745	They came through.
1217127	1228720	I would bet that a Fantasy Life or something that is new alongside PlayStation 5 and stuff is going to be selling better than...
1228700	1250602	I don't know what the audience is, to be honest, for some of these games.
1251703	1255467	Some people are saying this is a pushback on GameKey cards.
1256864	1258407	I mean, I don't know.
1258568	1261534	I still find a lot of that to be really overblown.
1261694	1265242	I got into a discussion of this on Blue Sky, and I do see the point.
1265302	1275463	I will say I do see the point and why people are pushing back on GameKey cards from a game preservation point is that at some point those cartridges will be worthless.
1275443	1280530	When the Switch systems do come down inevitably in the future, those cards are essentially going to be worthless.
1280951	1290685	So I do get it from that perspective, but I still also argue there are so many games on other platforms that are also doing this to you.
1290765	1299097	The day one patches are so fucking big and the game that's on the disc is not even the game it is now that there's so much out there that's already like this.
1299317	1303223	So I think some of this is a little unfair
1303203	1320432	But I get why people are frustrated, but I don't know if the public, your Golden T fans, shall we say, are aware enough of what's going on to really care about that whole situation.
1320453	1324399	But I mean, I guess I could be wrong, but I don't know.
1324419	1324840	Yeah.
1326187	1333857	Um, and Rinmari in chat says, to be fair, non-keycard Switch games can be corrupt if you don't run them for like a decade or more.
1334418	1335499	Hmm, true.
1335519	1336060	True, true, true.
1337682	1344411	Some folks in chat also commenting that the Switch 2 port of Cyberpunk is pretty good, and that might be another reason why it's doing pretty well.
1344431	1345893	So, all right.
1346654	1347655	Well...
1347989	1366420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1367243	1371953	I have been playing Mass Effect.
1372113	1373296	I beat Mass Effect 2.
1373316	1377204	I actually had to beat it twice because I screwed up the first time and accidentally got Morden killed.
1377865	1378366	Oh no!
1379329	1380391	Yeah, we can't have that.
1380431	1381774	We need him in Mass Effect 3.
1383076	1384780	For the time that you get him.
1386110	1387834	So I went back and did it again.
1388736	1389918	And everybody lived.
1390059	1390740	It was great.
1390760	1391903	And I started Mass Effect 3.
1392023	1398116	And the first thing I did, well, I mean, honestly, it's the second thing I did, I guess, was go get Garrus.
1398677	1400962	I was lurking a little on your stream last night.
1400982	1402946	And that's the part I saw was you going after Garrus.
1402986	1404169	And I was like, of course she is.
1405583	1424402	I just like the difference in interaction if you romanced him in the last game because instead of just going to shake your hand at that first meet back up again you go to shake hands and then he puts his other hand on top of her arm and I'm like, oh!
1425800	1455503	That's cute.
1455483	1458757	Even though Anderson punched you, Dina, in the first game, but still.
1459922	1461730	I'm playing Palia.
1461997	1469806	I was gonna say, you know, another game that gets a lot of those types of comparisons about wow, did it predict and you I know you were following this game for a while was Death Stranding, right?
1470227	1473991	And a big game that came out this last week of Death Stranding 2, which I haven't gotten around to yet.
1474392	1486806	But I'm very curious how that game hits now, especially since it was developed in a post COVID type of world, whereas the first game kind of predicted COVID not really, but you know, it's still if it
1486786	1503107	I also played Palia
1503475	1509605	I have another property now that I decided to move all my farming and crafting and everything onto.
1510326	1512509	And I've been experimenting with builds.
1513291	1516376	So I built a tiny house.
1516396	1517978	I'm still in the process of it.
1517998	1521884	I managed to make stairs from scratch, like spiral stairs.
1522625	1526732	I've been really getting into the kind of glitching modding, but like...
1526712	1535224	I have a complaint, and it's all these people who just make their properties so busy that it's overwhelming.
1536285	1541652	And while, yeah, I'm doing the glitching and I'm making interesting things, I do kind of like it.
1541673	1544957	I wouldn't say like utter maximalist or utter minimalist.
1545713	1568093	but I like things to be balanced and that's been the feedback I've gotten from people is that they think that my properties are pretty balanced even the busy ones so there's that but yeah those are pretty much what I've been playing are those okay well then we'll move on to Loki how was your gaming week?
1568950	1571535	I didn't play a whole lot because vacation and all.
1572016	1574561	I did bring my little retro console with me.
1575223	1581475	But my son basically took it the entire time to play Roblox on it.
1582282	1587888	I did play a different game this week.
1587908	1592153	I did play Peak, which is a co-op mountain climbing game.
1592253	1592994	It's kind of fun.
1593835	1595557	So I was able to do that with some friends.
1595817	1597979	And then, you know, Minecraft.
1598520	1599781	Doing the Minecraft stuff as well.
1601623	1607650	Basically what I've been able to do in the few days that I've had to actually play stuff since we came back.
1609772	1610533	Alright, that's it.
1611037	1612559	Well, then I'll talk about my gaming week.
1612639	1614241	So mine's been a little busier.
1614722	1616304	I went to Southern Fright Gaming Expo.
1616324	1618687	That's why I missed the show last week.
1619007	1624675	And they were good enough to have me back as a guest getting to do speaking on panels, which was fun.
1625556	1634648	Bobby and I got to do a fun little panel on games that ought to be better acknowledged as retro classics.
1634628	1655067	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1655047	1661093	So we'll record something for our YouTube channel, especially because Twitch doesn't really let us store things anymore.
1661193	1662734	So we'll probably have to grow out YouTube.
1662814	1667699	But we're going to record our panel for that for you to all watch at a later time if you weren't there.
1667759	1670982	But I was actually really – I'm going to be dead honest.
1671042	1674586	I was expecting four people in the room because I know not a lot of people are going to know.
1674626	1676127	Like, oh my god, it's VOG Network and stuff.
1676508	1678470	But people actually showed up.
1678870	1680091	We had a decent turnout in the room.
1680712	1682273	It was probably about two-thirds full.
1682293	1684075	And some people were really getting into it.
1684055	1691582	So we got to hear about some classics in turn, because of course in the last 10 minutes I was like, alright, your turn to pitch classics to us.
1691602	1695746	And so Bobby and I kind of fielded some classics from them, which was great.
1695846	1696687	And so we had a good time.
1696867	1700651	I wish we could do that sort of thing at more conventions.
1700791	1704774	So if you happen to run a convention out there, let me know.
1704914	1709158	Especially if it's on the West Coast, because it's Bobby's turn to come out to the West Coast for a convention.
1709299	1712982	Although I guess he did do TwitchCon in Vegas, but still.
1713299	1714403	So there's that.
1714484	1719804	I'm sure, hey, if it was on the West Coast, I'm sure Jamie and Matt would love to talk about obscure classics.
1720186	1723579	Jamie would need a three-hour panel to talk about obscure classics.
1725500	1746057	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1746037	1765075	Thanks for watching!
1765055	1769821	It felt a lot like that kind of like decompression sort of thing that's kind of in between.
1769841	1771424	And I love it as a show.
1771484	1772525	It's great.
1772585	1774508	But I was asked to do a celebrity panel.
1774568	1781257	The celebrities in this case were motion capture actors from the original Mortal Kombat trilogy.
1781277	1785563	So I actually had John Parrish who played Jax in Mortal Kombat 2 and 3.
1786043	1793273	And then I had Leah Montelongo who played Sindel in Mortal Kombat 3.
1793253	1812342	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1813553	1828322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1828758	1855069	they're all fitness people from Chicago that's who got recruited into all those games in the beginning it's a circle of fitness instructors in the Chicago area and they all are still very active in the fitness world and actively promoting fitness products I think uh Leah is doing like a pageant she's looking for support in like a Miss Petite I think this is the name of it it's on her Instagram uh Leah Montelongo if you want to um see all that and I'm sure she'd appreciate the love and the votes for that but um
1855049	1859073	Yeah, it was great to just talk to them about their experiences with making the Mortal Kombat games.
1859553	1869202	Also very interesting to sort of understand that like when they made those games, there were no performance actor or voice actor unions.
1869962	1876248	There were no agreements to payment or what somebody would get out of this sort of thing.
1876268	1877689	And let me put it this way.
1877709	1884195	I have a feeling that doing these conventions, I have a feeling, I haven't been confirmed one way or the other, but I have a feeling...
1884175	1893122	Doing these conventions and selfies and autographs is the only way that these folks see money from these games that are getting republished over and over again.
1893575	1897260	Just because games were made differently in the 1990s.
1897280	1898541	And they were made very differently.
1898562	1904129	So yeah, if you see the motion capture folks come through your local convention, toss a coin to your Witcher.
1904669	1905771	Toss a coin to your Sindel.
1905851	1910918	Because they made these characters what they are, really.
1910938	1915043	And they talked a lot about, you know, like Leah talked about the Scream.
1915023	1918107	And that the scream came from that she was given direction.
1918427	1920911	What will you do if somebody was about to attack you?
1920951	1923314	A big demon beast is coming at you and about to attack you.
1923334	1924836	And she said, I'd probably scream.
1925417	1926939	And that's where the Sindel scream came from.
1927279	1930744	So they really had a lot to do with the creation of their character.
1930784	1934148	And Jon had a lot to say about the creation of Jax.
1934549	1936772	About why Jax was put in the game in the first place.
1937112	1939415	And how he got the robotic arms in 3.
1939535	1940577	And where that really came from.
1940597	1941638	Because I asked...
1941618	1949168	I said, is the underground legend true about, like, it's Jax had his own fatality performed on him?
1949649	1957619	And the reaction John gave me was the biggest what-the-fuck look I've ever gotten in my life on one of these panels.
1957639	1960343	So, no, it's not what that is.
1960964	1968013	But I will let you all hopefully check out the panel on his YouTube or Instagram to get the complete answer to that when it comes out.
1968685	1972108	But I'll give you, you want the short version?
1972128	1973170	I'll give you the short version.
1973230	1975292	I'm just going to give you the honest answer the way he said it.
1975972	1988465	The reason why he has metal arms is that from his perspective, he went to Ed Boon, John Tobias, and said, the black guy should have magical powers too, is basically what he said.
1989046	1990907	And so that's why he has metal arms.
1991368	1993410	So that's...
1993390	1993911	Fair enough!
1994771	1998596	But then he had to go through six-hour makeup sessions to get those arms on.
2000918	2002680	Anyway, I really enjoyed doing that panel.
2002700	2003581	That was a lot of fun.
2005523	2010568	It was a great time, and I thank Southern Fried for having me host that panel.
2010628	2011950	It was great.
2011970	2015654	And then, yeah, I just got to play games out there all weekend.
2015674	2016895	So I played a lot of pinball.
2017055	2019398	I played the Dungeons & Dragons table, which I think I talked about before.
2019418	2020078	It was great.
2020459	2021760	I loved it.
2021740	2043293	I was hoping Jamie would have that table because I'd like to play more but I guess I'll just have to find a place locally that has it and sink some more quarters into it because I really enjoyed that table I played the King Kong table too which was fun Jersey Jack was mainly showing off a table I'm not interested in but they did have one table I was interested in well they had several but one that I did play was
2043273	2044054	Elton John.
2044555	2045956	And that table was great.
2046177	2047438	I loved it.
2047458	2052985	Man, that table is like a 4th of July show because it's just like lights, sound with all the Elton John music.
2053166	2055128	I could have played that table the entire weekend.
2055148	2059474	But of course, these tables, they have lines, you know, people or other people want to play.
2059714	2061276	But I really like their Elton John table.
2061296	2062798	So that was my favorite Jersey Jack table.
2063098	2068325	My favorite Stern table was probably Dungeons and Dragons, but they had that new Elvira table.
2068345	2071609	And I'm always going to play Elvira for my husband, even if he's not there.
2071589	2077684	I'm always going to play Elvira for my husband because Elvira is his favorite pinball table, even if it's not really the new one.
2077724	2081012	I don't think he has as much in his brain as the other ones.
2081433	2083097	But that's a fun table, too.
2083117	2085002	So, yeah, played a lot of pinball.
2085664	2087067	Really enjoyed the...
2088734	2089134	Excuse me.
2089154	2090015	You'll have to excuse me.
2090035	2090996	I brought back a little cold.
2091017	2096563	I brought back con crud because, you know, my immunocompromised ass always gets sick going to conventions.
2096583	2097804	No, it's not the big one.
2097844	2101608	I tested multiple times for that, but it is annoying nonetheless.
2101788	2109237	So if you hear me coughing and all that stuff, that's me getting over the SFGE plague or actually, actually, I think it's the Delta Airlines plague.
2109557	2112620	Based on when I got it, I'm pretty sure I picked it up on the flight home.
2112640	2114302	So I don't think I can blame the con for this one.
2114643	2117846	But airplanes are probably worse than cons in that regard.
2118647	2118707	Um,
2118687	2124913	Anyway, where was I going with the rest of this?
2125153	2128577	I saw some cool vintage computing stuff and indie stuff.
2128597	2132340	There was a really cool little double screen Commodore 128 game.
2132360	2137265	Bobby talked a little bit about it on his show, but I love that people are still doing new things with vintage computers.
2137685	2138766	I thought it was really cool.
2138786	2144152	So yeah, there's a lot going on at Southern Fried that's not just the pinball and console rooms.
2145313	2146294	It's a good time for a weekend.
2146314	2147715	It's just so compressed.
2147695	2151163	I was done with it in like two days.
2151183	2153428	And it's like, whoa, I'm so used to DragonCon being a week.
2153448	2155312	But this is the appetizer.
2156595	2158159	Oh, yeah.
2158279	2161205	Bobby Blackwolf reminds me about this.
2161225	2164573	They had a full motion afterburner cabinet there.
2164553	2188502	and I plopped in that and I played that and I think Bobby got video of it I don't think I ever posted the video I need to post it on my blue sky because I never got I never edited it down because my phone was almost out of battery that day but I have video of me playing a full motion afterburner cabinet oh my god that was so fun so fun yeah rotate rotating like full like I was going to what
2189512	2191374	I was making a lot of sounds playing that game.
2191675	2192316	It was a lot of fun.
2192716	2194178	I actually get really motion sick in it.
2194679	2196261	Yeah, it moves a lot.
2196281	2199164	So it's probably a reason they haven't made one like it in a long time.
2199264	2202028	So I'll get that video edited and up on my Blue Sky.
2202108	2203950	I literally forgot it was on there.
2205092	2206674	True, true.
2206954	2212041	And it's a lot more motiony, but it's more fluid and it actually moves.
2212521	2216346	And so just like the slide back and forth thing, it's full on.
2216579	2236444	F-Zero Cabinet
2236424	2239929	and I think I've been playing it for 25 hours, which for me is a lot.
2240530	2256154	It's less than what Bobby, Bobby said he was up to 40 hours, but I think I'm at like 25 hours and I've just been trying to level up all my crafting and get my little town, little stuff built for my town and lay it out to increase my little, because it's very Animal Crossing.
2256134	2259679	It's very like Animal Crossing meets Zelda Link to the Past.
2259939	2261281	Because you actually have action.
2261641	2265446	The action parts are pretty simple.
2265506	2266627	I'm going to be real.
2266768	2269071	It's not a lot more complex than button mashing.
2269411	2273396	I would say it's about the similar to the combat in Zelda Link to the Past.
2273656	2275138	Is what the combat is in Fantasy Life.
2275198	2275659	But I don't know.
2275679	2277722	I find it very satisfying.
2277862	2280245	It's an MMO without the other people.
2280265	2281146	So...
2281514	2283756	That's, yeah, Bobby says I'm also at the same place you are.
2283776	2288540	Yeah, I just got to the area where chapter six starts.
2288560	2294866	And then I said, oh, I need to go back and mine more silver because I have a shit ton of crafting to do, especially because I just got another blacksmith.
2295327	2299591	So I stopped there to catch up on my crafting because I have a lot.
2299791	2305996	My one thing that's holding me back right now is I do not have anyone to assist with, what do they call it?
2306057	2307618	Woodcutting, I think is what it's called.
2307658	2308979	Chopping down trees.
2308999	2310981	I do not have any woodcutters.
2310961	2312263	Besides just me.
2312724	2317072	So that's what I've got to find.
2317092	2319397	I've got to find one in Jaina Morsar or something like that.
2320198	2324086	I have two minors as well, but not a woodcutter.
2324887	2325789	Anyway, Fantasy Life.
2326430	2327552	It's been a lot.
2327532	2331118	Next week we have a new Diablo 4 season, so I'll be back on that.
2331138	2341797	I also learned during our downtime, I'll mention this real quick, I learned during our downtime, I got access to Twitch's stream in 2K thing.
2341817	2345043	So I did a Mario Kart stream in 2K randomly during the week.
2345063	2347768	It was kind of unannounced for the moment, I just wanted to test 2K.
2348269	2350232	It ran perfectly.
2350212	2351594	Perfectly.
2351794	2354578	And so I'm excited because I can run those streams.
2355299	2367317	And since I mentioned my birthday was last week and Alan's is coming up in a little over a week, we sometimes buy ourselves matching birthday presents.
2367337	2372524	So a few years ago in 2022, we bought ourselves matching computers.
2372504	2390412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2390695	2396790	and I agreed we're going to get brand new video cards for our machines that will work.
2397271	2402904	So I'm really excited for the beefy power it's going to allow me for streaming PC games pretty soon.
2403005	2408518	So yeah, very excited about that coming up in a few weeks.
2408937	2411842	Video cards are a little bit of a wait right now, of course.
2412343	2413725	So that's good.
2414827	2415568	All right.
2416049	2417151	I think that's it for my gaming week.
2417492	2419535	And that's all I have to say as far as updates.
2419555	2421018	So I think y'all want some more gaming news.
2421218	2421999	So let's get to it.
2422160	2424023	Loki starts off with some gaming news.
2424043	2425105	All right.
2425125	2427449	Let's talk about some Xbox updates.
2427689	2432818	Well, first, a pretty bad update, which is that they're going to be laying out more people.
2433473	2441868	According to Bloomberg, there's another big layoff coming by the end of the fiscal quarter, which is tomorrow.
2443551	2445254	So that's not great.
2445274	2455212	And apparently they're expecting substantial cuts across Xbox, though it's not clear which teams or studios are going to be hit the hardest by it.
2456394	2456494	Yeah.
2457588	2487156	Yeah, so that sucks.
2487136	2491884	I feel so sorry for those folks, especially because Microsoft's having a pretty good year.
2492365	2493868	Game Pass, better than ever.
2494249	2495932	So this doesn't fucking make sense.
2495972	2496332	I'm sorry.
2496352	2508033	And yes, I know, yes, you can tell me the logic side of it, that it's about projections for the future year, and perhaps Microsoft is scaling back in the hardware space because of the, you know, and all this stuff.
2508053	2509956	Yes, you can logic this and stuff.
2509976	2511439	It still sucks.
2512060	2520265	there's no easy way to put that especially when the board the CEO makes a lot of money it just sucks
2522489	2522789	Yeah.
2523911	2526496	So I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens with that.
2527577	2534208	The other thing was there's an update for the Xbox 360 after, what, 20-some years?
2534429	2534990	The 360.
2535050	2536612	Yeah, the Xbox 360.
2537494	2538335	And what's it do?
2538455	2540238	Well, not much.
2540559	2543704	Apparently it's...
2543802	2569000	it also it basically adds two large ads to the home screen now this isn't just like advertising for like everything you're not going to see like Mountain Dew on there or something like that it is just basically a large static picture showing the new Xbox have you thought about upgrading your Xbox yeah and a QR code that says experience next gen performance upgrade today um
2568980	2577969	So, I guess just reminding you that, hey, there's new consoles out there, which, I mean, yeah, you probably know that already.
2577989	2579831	I mean, it's been 20-some years.
2579851	2582413	You can go, oh, when did that new Xbox come out?
2582433	2584395	When did that newfangled Xbox come out?
2584476	2585677	Actually, go to the Best Buy.
2585817	2595166	I got the last one was the Xbox One, and I have the 360, so it's going to be 360 more consoles before it's brand new, I guess.
2596327	2596928	Um...
2597397	2599400	You know, so I don't know.
2599420	2601964	I think it's more shocking that they, like, did an update.
2603066	2604729	It seems wholly unnecessary.
2604749	2607674	Especially because they pulled down the fucking store, so why did they do an update?
2607694	2608234	It's weird.
2608254	2616628	Like, you spent developer time to do this, and, like, is that really good to increase sales?
2616648	2619793	Is it possible it also patched up hacking exploit type of things?
2620702	2623405	I don't know.
2624426	2626489	I don't think so.
2626509	2631174	But yeah, essentially other than that, I don't know.
2631234	2634538	It says also it fixed a strange graphical bug that's been a problem.
2636821	2638963	But I don't know what that bug was necessarily.
2639003	2640985	But it did at least fix something.
2642567	2643028	All right.
2645090	2646692	Cool.
2646959	2654367	All right, well, I guess since Loki brought up layoffs, I will continue this unfortunate trend here.
2655307	2661694	This one's a little less surprising considering the news, but it is very unfortunate how fast this is happening.
2661714	2667480	And yep, it's the studio that made Mind's Eye, which, you know, they did not have a great launch.
2667720	2668901	It did not go very well.
2669502	2675548	So over at Build a Rocket Boy, which was the studio, apparently...
2675528	2685033	The Redundancy Process, which is what they call the layoff process overseas, has been initiated for the 300-person office that's located over in the UK.
2685835	2691951	Laws do require a 45-day process before people are fired when it is more than 100.
2691931	2697565	So that means they're probably looking at probably a good chunk of that studio being closed.
2698568	2703280	So there's also 200 people for that company working abroad.
2704162	2705606	So that's just really unfortunate.
2705666	2708573	But as y'all know, Mind's Eye did not
2708553	2727338	and DarkSakura.
2727318	2734827	And by the way, Build A Rocket Boy did confirm upcoming layoffs in a statement to IGN who reached out for comments.
2735147	2742837	But they say they are focused on continuing to update Mind's Eye and developed on the one-year post-launch content.
2742857	2749665	So maybe they had something bigger in store or a sequel that now nobody wants to invest in because of how this game went.
2749685	2750987	It's just a bummer.
2751007	2753730	It's, you know, just...
2753710	2754671	It's rough, man.
2754691	2758796	And that's less than two weeks after this game came out.
2761058	2765523	Yeah, especially since it's not even necessarily the developers' problems with this.
2765703	2771450	It's more of like, you know, some executive said, okay, release it in the state.
2771490	2776155	We need to release it to meet some goal or get some bonus or something like that.
2776936	2781000	And it could have been fixed, but... It could have.
2781487	2786795	Yeah, well, and you know, technically it could still end up on a path like Cyberpunk, like No Man's Sky.
2786815	2799092	I feel like we say these, we say this, No Man's Sky comes up on this show every fucking week because I feel like there is, and not just because I love the game, because there's some other game where we go, well, they could always make it like No Man's Sky and turn it around.
2799493	2801976	Well, they could always do a Diablo 3.
2801956	2803037	Here's the thing.
2803057	2804219	Okay, so here's the thing.
2804499	2806562	And there's that argument that's made all the time.
2806582	2808704	It's like, well, we can turn around like No Man's Sky.
2808744	2809345	That's right.
2809826	2810106	Right.
2810166	2813290	But No Man's Sky had good bones to begin with.
2814071	2816013	This game does not.
2816053	2818736	I think there's a dozen people that work at Hello Games.
2818756	2819297	Right.
2819317	2822621	This game is essentially Saints Row.
2822641	2824583	The reboot is what this game is.
2824704	2825745	The bones are bad.
2826105	2828568	And when they fix it, it's still going to be a bad game.
2829009	2830090	So...
2830357	2831599	Yeah, no thanks.
2831619	2833781	I'm not interested in them fixing it.
2836024	2838367	Sure they could, but it's gonna be bad either way.
2840009	2844415	Alright, well let's move into a segment of stories.
2844435	2848840	We have multiple stories on this big topic going on in the industry right now.
2849701	2851103	Jamie, would you like to start us off?
2854087	2855048	So...
2855551	2861321	Runway is looking to go into the video game industry with Generative AI.
2862764	2870658	They have recently partnered with AMC Networks for their business and are now trying to go into gaming.
2870999	2872682	They have...
2872662	2875225	A platform that they're going to launch called Game Worlds.
2876106	2886616	It says next week, but the tool lets users create interactive text-based games that can generate text and images from AI.
2888478	2898028	It can only do basic designs for now, but they are hoping this is the first step toward more generative AI in the industry.
2898008	2914305	and their CEO Cristobal Valenzuela said that, and this is a quote, generated video games are coming later this year and that they want to partner with other companies too.
2915127	2917131	I don't think this is going to go down very well.
2917685	2937457	And in fact, they've even, you know, had their own controversies about training their AI from YouTube videos and pirated movies, you know, but they are wanting to try to do what they did in film and TV with video games.
2938058	2941684	And I mean,
2943166	2947503	Ubisoft already has Ghost Rider and Barf.
2947523	2949892	But still.
2949912	2952703	I feel completely ill at ease.
2953122	2982825	I'm failing to see what contribution this is going to bring to the industry because to create these text-based games out of AI I feel like just like a lot of times when I see the stuff AI and then it is presented to us straight up as AI I feel like there's no soul inside of it inside a lot of the art that you see come out of it inside of a lot of the you know things that are being automatically built there's no fucking soul in it and you know if we're to accept video games as art
2982805	3007513	DarkSakura.com
3008472	3009154	R.I.P.
3017412	3027375	The Vivian
3027355	3029318	Yeah, I remember.
3030880	3053312	I remember.
3053292	3073444	A&I
3074015	3075717	That's the key thing with AI.
3075938	3077780	AI can be a jumpstart.
3077800	3084630	AI can maybe help you lay down the foundation, help you solve a coding crisis, help you get that type of information.
3084650	3087995	But AI cannot replace the soul of the artist.
3088756	3089296	And what is there?
3089336	3091319	And especially that comes with telling stories.
3091339	3092200	Ubisoft.
3092221	3097047	But we all know Ubisoft is run by a bunch of fucking morons at this point who's not going to get it.
3097067	3099090	They make the same game every time anyways.
3099150	3102315	It's been Far Cry for however long now.
3102335	3103296	I think the last...
3103276	3107122	Game of theirs that I played was Avatar and it was really good.
3107322	3108684	Yeah.
3108704	3111228	But that's about that's about it.
3111248	3115033	I think they've abandoned that franchise as good as that game was.
3115053	3120101	I mean, but this is the thing is that I'm fine with assistive AI.
3120541	3124908	Like, for example, an app I use all the time, Pixelmator.
3125509	3126330	Right.
3126310	3132436	It has a super resolution tool that can actually help upscale things that I'm resizing.
3133136	3134017	And that's useful.
3134718	3141084	It's mildly generative, I would reckon, but it's only trained on the material I present before it, right?
3143446	3146769	Something that might check my grammar.
3148110	3155777	That's kind of early days of machine learning, right?
3157073	3161117	Oh yeah, AI of some form has been around forever, right?
3161137	3165782	It's just this whole language learning is the new thing.
3165802	3173830	Yeah, and also to correct fifth dream, AI facilitates the taking of jobs.
3173850	3177373	I kind of agree with this point, though.
3177394	3183840	If a CEO could create robots, like, for example, self-checkout at a grocery store,
3185356	3195314	and Fire, then technically it's the fact that that technology exists and the CEO made the decision that is ending any kind of job.
3195755	3199462	The whole fact that people are relying on it.
3199482	3206595	Saying that AI takes jobs is just a short way to say that the CEOs making the decision to use it are taking the jobs.
3207336	3209440	Stop arguing over semantics.
3209420	3218934	I would agree that a smart CEO, I think at the core of the point, a smart CEO doesn't say, how can AI replace workers?
3219054	3223742	A smart CEO says, how can AI make my existing workers even better to put out a better product?
3223782	3224743	No, that's not a smart CEO.
3224783	3226946	That's an ethical CEO, and there's a difference.
3229450	3232695	I guess it depends on your perspective.
3232735	3238043	The job of the CEO is to make money and keep the company afloat and make their shareholders happy.
3239002	3242107	So a smart CEO is someone who can do that successfully.
3242608	3248639	An ethical CEO is the one who does it with the best interest of the employees at heart.
3248739	3251624	Ranmari in chat says that would require CEOs to have a heart.
3252485	3253467	Some do.
3254577	3256259	Where I work, it's pretty good.
3256800	3261186	Yeah, and I've had a very fortunate experience in my career as well.
3261206	3270419	But I absolutely, especially after commenting on video games for the last 23 years, I think we all know there's plenty of CEOs in this industry, the gaming industry, that are dumpster fires.
3270439	3271741	But there's also been some good ones.
3271761	3272442	Iwata, right?
3272562	3275406	Everybody holds Iwata to like the gold standard of like gaming CEOs.
3275626	3280092	So there's good ones, you know, but there's also the Bobby Kotick's of the world.
3280112	3281935	So anyway.
3283636	3295332	And the biggest thing, again, that I have with anything that is generative AI is how they have trained their models.
3297074	3305665	If they are out there, just like we were saying with Runway, they trained their shit on pirated movies and YouTube.
3307007	3307548	Why?
3308049	3310332	That is... No.
3310512	3310572	No.
3311547	3315471	or just like the ones that are just like, for example, DeviantArt.
3315551	3320617	If you post art on DeviantArt, I would take it the fuck down unless you want it to train their AI.
3322479	3324301	Well, and tweets now, right?
3324481	3337835	So if you're still on Twitter, their twat is scraping all the tweets and powering Grok, which is now supposed to go over to Telegram for whatever goddamn reason we need Grok over there.
3337955	3340558	It's silly.
3341922	3343984	The name sums up how I feel about it.
3344525	3348870	All right.
3348910	3358921	Yeah, I'm sure this show has been used to train AI, even though no permission has been given, no coin has been seen.
3358942	3359903	But what can you do?
3359923	3361024	It's on the internet, right?
3361144	3363086	So people just feel they can do whatever they want with it.
3364808	3368993	It's the same thing as right-click saving a Shutterstock image.
3371116	3376400	Okay, there's no real way to watermark audio, I guess.
3376741	3377987	Yeah.
3378642	3385008	But you can watermark an image, of course, anyone with actual graphical skill can do that.
3385288	3388311	Don't you remember downloading MP3s on Napster back in the day?
3388391	3397880	Don't you remember there would be the one that occasionally you would get that would play the song and then in the middle of it it would be like, Cracked by DJ Loki or whatever would play in the background.
3397900	3405527	There used to be shit MP3 rips like that that would be watermarked or the radio station would do it during premieres.
3405507	3407050	They would put their call sign on it.
3407390	3408091	W-A-B-C.
3408191	3411437	You know, during a premiere that gets ripped and then put out on Napster.
3412058	3415323	So... Anyway.
3415343	3417607	We have plenty more on this subject, don't we, Loki?
3418989	3419770	Mm-hmm.
3419790	3420932	Yeah.
3420952	3421373	Well...
3422618	3444863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3444843	3460675	So I was reading up on this a little bit.
3460655	3463899	This is a bummer because I want to play this game.
3463939	3464740	I played the demo.
3465221	3466422	It looked really interesting.
3466442	3468184	It was pretty fun from what I played.
3468204	3470767	I actually don't believe the bulk of the game is using AI.
3471408	3482401	I think what happened, and I think this gets into it, some of the things that came up at the last minute, rushing to production, some of the – because where's the AI script being seen?
3482421	3487067	It's like flavor text in the background on a computer screen somewhere where they left in the –
3487047	3488710	Sure, I can look that up for you.
3488730	3490975	And then it happened in some of the translations.
3491295	3499111	But there's actually a translator who worked on the game who said, I worked on this game, translating it into Korean or whatever language they did.
3499732	3500834	I worked on this.
3500854	3505984	This is probably them changing something at the last minute, and they didn't want to bring me back to do it.
3505964	3509108	and that's what you get, essentially, at the end of the day.
3509368	3511772	That's what you get for not using a human being.
3511792	3514555	And they used AI to speed up the process.
3514876	3516558	Well, y'all got sloppy.
3516578	3532859	And now your game's going to have the AI stank label on it because, and I do truly believe they did not use AI in the bulk of the game, but somebody cut a corner and they did it really sloppily and now this entire game's going to pay for it.
3534361	3535583	That's a bummer.
3536390	3540542	Yeah, so that's what's going on release with that one.
3540842	3552154	Then we have Jurassic World Evolution 3, which angered fans by having AI-generated scientist portraits in the game.
3552134	3569539	This was disclosed on their Steam page already, but with the fan backlash, they've put out a message on their social media saying, We removed the use of generative AI for scientist portraits in Jurassic World Evolution 3.
3570019	3575307	Following some initial feedback, the teams are continuing their diligent work.
3575287	3579232	On the game and are very much looking forward to launching on October 21st.
3579953	3583898	Don't let that headline get lost in the shuffle.
3584118	3589745	The feedback, as harsh as it was, the feedback worked.
3590646	3595472	Pushing back on the AI worked.
3595792	3598155	Don't underestimate the power of this headline.
3599654	3629239	and then we also have another game disclosing use of AI and that is the brand new Everybody's Golf Hot Shots brand new golf game coming out and it says the AI tools were used on or it says generative AI is used in this game and the usage is for tree and leaf textures in golf courses were created using AI generated images it sounds like it's kind of
3630215	3635521	They should have just paid for SpeedTree or something like that, some sort of middleware to do that.
3635581	3638325	This is just cutting corners, it sounds like.
3640347	3645133	But once again, it's not necessarily up front, it's kind of way in the background.
3646214	3653623	So you might not even necessarily notice it, but still gross, because that's still a person's job to...
3653840	3656804	Do textures and make geometry like that.
3657325	3664194	So the fact that they just skipped that whole process and went to AI to generate it is kind of lame.
3666036	3670322	Well, we'll see what kind of bad quality comes out of that decision to cut the corner there.
3670442	3674447	So because again, when you just replace, you're asking for a disaster.
3674787	3676149	So we'll see what happens.
3676169	3678312	What's going to happen when like, I mean...
3679372	3688105	I don't know if they would do this, but let's just say, what's going to happen when we find out Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot of degenerative AI in it or something like that?
3688125	3693072	They used it to, I don't know, write text or something.
3693172	3707573	Loki, I would consider that story on the altars a warning, because to me, that's what happens the next time GTA 6 has to push, push, push and miss a deadline, is you're going to start sloppy use of AI trying to cut corners.
3707772	3712060	I think the Alters is a warning shot in that debate.
3712260	3714024	I don't think they would risk that.
3714885	3730995	Granted, like the last time with Generative AI and the Definitive Editions, that was because they outsourced it to a company and the company thought they could just throw it into a tool and it would automatically be able to work for them, which is not true.
3732427	3760813	so I have a story on AI as well this one's interesting because this is an accusation where it hasn't been confirmed but this game has been getting a lot of shit because it looks like it used a lot of AI and the game is Front Mission 3 a remake just launched on the Switch and you know people are generally excited to see Front Mission 3 get a remake but then some screenshots and comparisons started to come out that made people go sniff sniff
3760793	3776322	I smell a chat GPT so you know for those of you that are watching live I'll show you some of the posts from Blue Sky so you can check it out for yourself that are comparing the original to the remake this was the thing that caught my eye immediately off the guard oh you see it Jamie?
3776723	3778086	Yeah.
3778487	3779670	Yeah.
3779891	3784241	Yeah.
3784822	3794766	Yeah.
3794746	3806480	Something else I noticed is that the microphone seems to have that sort of garbled text you usually see when AI doesn't know exactly how to generate a text.
3806500	3808443	But this is the biggest damning thing to me.
3808463	3809504	I want you to notice this.
3810065	3815571	In the original, we have the Japanese Defense Force Forum, D-E-F-E-N-S-E.
3815972	3821158	And then you see it said here again, J-D-F, Japan Defense, D-E-F-E-N-S-E.
3821138	3833471	Then in the remake, Japanese Defense Forum, Japan, D-E-F-E-N-S-E But look down here, Japan, D-E-F-E-N-C-E Not S-E, did I say C-E?
3833531	3844783	Sorry, my brain might have been getting to the conclusion C-E would have been European, yeah But my point is, they changed it It was consistent in the original, it was changed in the remake
3846282	3858981	and there's some other comparison screens as well that do make it look like they may have just enhanced, tried to run something through, you know, a thing that makes these weird things that I'm not even sure would otherwise actually exist.
3859261	3864229	The thing that gets me, what is like this old ass car doing in this very modern, it's so strange.
3864569	3868856	But somebody, the first reply I thought was so wild.
3869356	3875125	The first, this is a reply, but somebody showing that AI doesn't always get it right.
3875105	3878395	So anyway, there is nothing confirmed on the front.
3878415	3886621	And for the folks on the podcast, it is a pixelated picture of Barack Obama and the AI turned him into somebody that very much did not look like Barack Obama.
3886641	3887865	So...
3888908	3890730	Very interesting what's going on there.
3890790	3894014	But I'm hearing that remake get raked through the coals.
3894054	3895156	It's not just the AI thing.
3895196	3898340	It sounds like a lot of slop and cut corners on that remake.
3898760	3900102	So, yeah, it's unfortunate.
3900122	3912277	It certainly doesn't look like... Because you would think that what they would do with something like this is if you're going to improve the graphics, you have the original... Obviously, these were scanned in a long time ago.
3912297	3914720	I don't think that this pixel art was created by hand.
3914740	3917363	It was probably some sort of like...
3917343	3923633	concept art or something that they had that they generated and scanned in or digitized some way.
3924074	3932007	And that's how, you know, obviously after scaling it down a ton resolution wise, that's how you came out with this.
3932107	3936735	But yeah, a lot of this doesn't look right at all.
3937357	3938519	I'm going to chat.
3938559	3943086	TigerClaw in chat says, Generative AI will be incorporated to many games, even if they don't have it in them.
3943446	3948934	A lot of the newer GPUs use what's called frame generation, which use generated AI to create fake frames.
3949415	3955745	Look, again, I understand that AI is a tool that's not going away, and AI is a necessary tool in the industry as well.
3955785	3958809	We're not going to get to 8K art and video games.
3958829	3960892	We're not going to get to the super duper HD.
3960912	3964057	We don't get to the holodeck without some form of AI.
3964518	3965980	But the question is,
3965960	3967944	What is that AI specifically doing?
3968466	3969668	How is it trained?
3970430	3972094	And what is it really replacing at the end of the day?
3972234	3975100	Especially that one that looks like it's like an internal office scene.
3975200	3978327	So that's a fountain that's right there in there.
3978408	3983158	And they converted it into some sort of just like lobby without a fountain there.
3983138	4009483	and then there's a person that has like a weird backwards knee or something that's like standing there as well I believe just for the live listeners you are referring to this picture here that's the lobby and in the first one there's like very clearly a couple fountains there in front of the bush and then in the other one it looks like they put a chair yeah like look at that look at the person look at the person right there like or I'm assuming that's a person that's like right there
4009666	4012515	Just to the left of the bush.
4012856	4014420	Like, how is that leg?
4014621	4016707	No, no, all the way to the right there.
4017209	4019556	Not that one, the one next to it.
4020118	4022545	The one to the... No, you're...
4022744	4025910	Just saying, just saying, the podcast folks can't see me pointing anyway.
4025930	4035588	Yeah, so on the left, just right, or left of the bush in the middle there, there's like a profile of a person, and their leg looks like it goes backwards.
4035608	4038774	They have like weird bird legs or something like that.
4038794	4040077	Well, and this person has one leg.
4041640	4042321	Yes, one leg.
4043363	4043503	Mm-hmm.
4043787	4047692	And there's a reflection of a person that doesn't exist on there, too.
4049414	4052198	Look, therein is the problem.
4052218	4057765	And just to illustrate, they used AI to do all of the work.
4057785	4065515	If AI had helped them start the work and then realized, came in here and said, you got a dude with one leg in the background here.
4065595	4066256	We need to go in.
4066356	4067538	We need to clean this up by hand.
4067838	4068959	These are supposed to be fountains.
4068979	4070481	We need to go in and clean this up.
4071583	4073305	This would be a lot less of a problem.
4075715	4079062	Yeah, some AI upscaling isn't necessarily bad.
4079142	4082990	It does a pretty good job of it, but the resolution has to be something decent.
4083010	4093892	You can't just take like 240p and expect to pump it up to 4K without it completely changing what it is because it's very hard to tell what it is
4093872	4097937	just from, there's not a lot of data there for it to upscale.
4097997	4114696	So that's why having the original image that they would have referenced or used to create this image in the first place, because it does look digitized, obviously, that would have been able to, they would have been able to bring those assets in or even just upscale them from the originals.
4114716	4116278	But they probably don't have that anymore.
4116338	4123626	And so instead of paying an artist that would look at it and be able to like recreate it, they just like, ah, it's good enough.
4126002	4130694	Alright, I need something not about AI to cleanse the palate here.
4130794	4133521	DarkSakura, are there games out there without AI?
4135045	4136248	How about on Wikipedia?
4137460	4147335	Yeah, Wikipedia is getting into the whole daily game thing with, you know, kind of like what Wordle is and Washington Post and Atlantic and all of that business doing.
4148336	4149298	Yeah.
4149318	4150600	LinkedIn has games.
4150960	4152422	Some of them are actually kind of fun, though.
4152582	4153263	I hate to say it.
4153304	4154545	Like LinkedIn has that.
4154565	4159613	There's one where you draw a line and you have to use every I can't remember the name of it, but I like it.
4160294	4161696	A little puzzle game can be fun.
4162756	4184376	well this one's called which came first so it's like a wikipedia quiz and you just answer the questions from what i can see um i don't really play a lot of those games every so often i'll do like wordle if i'm bored um but uh yeah they're they're
4185470	4187353	doing more games.
4188194	4204538	I mean, I don't know what else to say about it, although with New York Times putting up Wordle and making very weird changes to it, there are so many clones of it out and about.
4206321	4212229	But this is one that at least works to try to improve people's knowledge.
4212770	4214633	So there you go.
4214798	4224851	You know, I'm glad Wikipedia is adding a new game besides the one I already play, which is how late can I stay up reading useless bullshit articles that might come up as a Jeopardy question someday.
4225011	4227434	That's the current game that I play on Wikipedia.
4227454	4228996	So I'm glad we have something with more structure.
4230118	4230498	It's great.
4232481	4235144	Loki.
4235164	4237968	Well, we had somewhat positive news.
4237988	4240351	Now let's talk about Randy Pitchford.
4240892	4240992	Okay.
4241292	4252616	Randy Pitchford, as you may remember, opened his dumb mouth about Borderlands 4 and talking about how real fans would pay for it no matter whatever the price.
4253258	4257968	And now he continues to double down on that with talking about the
4257948	4263794	Borderlands 3, 95% off sale, you know, which everyone's like, well, I'll just wait for a sale when it gets discounted.
4264736	4273585	And he's like, sales like this in Borderlands 3 showing up on console subscription programs took over five years from the game's launch to happen.
4274046	4276128	Take advantage of it when it's here.
4277209	4285018	It's like, sir, yeah, it wasn't 95% off a month later, but...
4286770	4288031	It was discounted.
4288051	4291175	Yeah, these discounts are not set by him either, oftentimes.
4291235	4295339	As we saw in that story about the Splitgate, which they had layoffs too.
4295399	4296801	I think that was when we were out.
4296821	4298042	That studio had layoffs too.
4298583	4306131	Wait, we need to mention, that guy's big fucking mouth at Summer Game Fest cost jobs at that studio.
4307413	4309695	Sorry, I just needed to point.
4309875	4312598	Your big mouth can really get you into trouble in this industry.
4312618	4313419	Be careful, folks.
4313579	4314280	Be careful.
4315424	4330519	So once again, with this, it's just that price point is the time to just jump into games, you know, just pre-ordering games and stuff like that.
4330539	4342090	We don't live in the era of gaming where updates weren't really possible, you know, unless you come out with a new version of your disc or something like that.
4342407	4354662	Thank you for watching!
4355080	4369199	Now that we are living in that environment where unfortunately a lot of these studios are taking advantage of that by, oh, we'll release the game and we'll patch it later and fix stuff or bring the actual functionality that it should have had from the get-go in there.
4369900	4374667	I think people are going to be a lot more cautious, especially when you're talking about $90 games.
4375147	4377070	It doesn't make sense to pre-order.
4377350	4380835	I think folks are going to start getting over this FOMO with...
4380815	4381777	Some of these newer games.
4381897	4384080	I like Borderlands.
4384101	4386184	I haven't heard too much about Borderlands 4 yet.
4386725	4391513	I know the initial trailer didn't really do it for me, but I like Borderlands.
4391533	4393977	I'm curious to see what they do with it.
4394698	4396401	But I'm not buying it day one.
4396561	4399887	I'm going to wait and see how the reviewers like it.
4399867	4408254	Which is, to be fair, Loki, which is unfortunate because, and I'm not shading your decision because I think a lot of people are making that, you laid it out.
4408735	4417923	But we had that earlier story about Mind's Eye and how it did so bad in its first week that now we've got layoffs.
4417943	4423467	So I understand Randy's passion and I understand why they're trying to move pre-orders and day one sales.
4423988	4426830	But I think the entire industry has to evaluate that.
4426850	4428672	But it's the same thing in the film industry.
4428812	4428912	Yeah.
4428892	4442580	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4442864	4446190	Well, bad in the, bad, not in a good way bad.
4446470	4451859	Like, bad as in just, like, not bad, like, not, not campy enough.
4451899	4459692	It just, like, kind of, it's like, one of the comparisons I heard to it was, like, Godzilla, where it's like,
4459672	4464637	I go to a Godzilla movie to see Godzilla fighting other monsters and stuff like that.
4464737	4468100	I don't give a shit about the humans that are there or like Transformers.
4468200	4471784	I don't give a shit about the fucking humans that are in the Transformers movie.
4471964	4473926	I want to see robots fighting each other.
4473946	4478851	So in a Megan movie, I want to see Megan fighting other robots.
4478911	4483135	But instead, she's out of her body for at least an hour of the movie.
4483496	4484937	It is just shit.
4484917	4495804	so Megan 2.0 is fourth place or fourth place at the box office it made less money than Elio which apparently was already considered a bust pretty bad yeah uh that's too bad
4496105	4512225	But, yeah, going back to Borderlands though, like, I feel that if these publishers want your day one money, the thing is they have to show a track record of, like, look, we put out polished games, our games are good, there's no reason that you shouldn't trust us with your money.
4512785	4518332	Back in, when, you know, we were, like, mainly physical media, pre, like,
4518312	4522578	Digital games out there, it was mostly physical.
4523018	4534474	Yeah, pre-order was important because if you're ordering from your local GameStop or smaller store, they are limited in what they can bring in as far as number of copies.
4534634	4539401	And it was, if you wanted to play a game day one, you had to pre-order that copy in order to do that.
4539801	4541704	Now that we live in a digital world,
4541684	4546835	There is no reason to pre-order a game at all because it is available right away.
4546855	4550042	There's not an issue of, oh, there's only X number of copies.
4550062	4554832	It is an infinite amount of copies of that game available as soon as you get it.
4555193	4557538	And what, they're going to give you some free skins or some shit?
4557878	4559021	Come on, you're better than that.
4559121	4560604	Like, just...
4560584	4577074	don't give them money up front and just wait and see how it is I'm gonna be honest like I mean Grand Theft Auto 6 same thing I mean I kind of want to wait and see how it is I mean I'm still gonna probably get it but like I still am gonna be hesitant to pick that up right away
4579670	4580411	All right.
4580992	4589448	Well, let's move on and talk about something that you can check out for free, although for how long is left to see.
4589589	4589909	Oops, sorry.
4589929	4596121	I didn't mean for the audio to come through, but I do want to show you this YouTube because it's pretty incredible.
4596141	4601070	So for those of you that are watching live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network tonight, I want to show you
4601050	4606337	Over here, some actual footage from the PC version of Mario Kart 64.
4607058	4607518	That's right.
4607558	4612304	So this was something that Loki had been referencing earlier in the show, talking about the Animal Crossing decompiling.
4612705	4616350	So what happened is that now Mario Kart 64 can be played on PC.
4616930	4620976	And so far, Nintendo does not seem to be challenging this.
4621736	4623098	Perhaps they're building a case.
4623118	4623959	Who knows?
4623979	4626062	But you have to have a ROM.
4626042	4649215	4K 120 frames per second.
4650359	4672637	so yeah it was reversed engineered from Mario Kart 64's original code and recreated to be able to play on the PC yeah wow a track editor in the game and all that too that's amazing so um yeah looks awesome I kind of want to I kind of want to stream this later maybe that might be something I need to do not like later tonight but later this week looks like fun
4673714	4675015	So, I'm going to check that out.
4675476	4677517	Because, of course, I own Mario Kart 64 illegally.
4677598	4678178	Actually, I do.
4678478	4682082	I have the cartridge somewhere in the closet because I bought it when I bought my 64-set.
4682122	4683243	It is really exciting.
4683523	4688988	Even in the modded space, as far as Mario Kart Wii has a lot of modded tracks.
4689028	4697175	I have a couple versions of the game on my handheld emulator thing that have 400-some tracks on it.
4697195	4701499	It's a ridiculous amount of stuff that people have created, like fan tracks and stuff.
4701559	4702540	So,
4702520	4706427	I'm very excited to see what they do with Mario Kart and stuff like that.
4706447	4709733	Can you imagine like level sharing or something like that, creating your own?
4709753	4712378	Like they really need like a Mario Kart maker would be kind of cool.
4712398	4715444	Just like a retro one, you know, like it would be kind of fun.
4716345	4720833	In chat, SJ100 Matt says, again, Nintendo is sleeping on doing this themselves.
4720854	4721254	Yes.
4722456	4726063	However, I can see why there's a certain coat of polish there.
4726043	4751545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4751525	4778494	but you get a little bit of that Final Fantasy 8 remake y'all remember that when that came out where it put like the 4k textures on the old backgrounds that I'm sorry that game looked terrible you either do it all or you do none of it um and so that's I think there's a certain sense of polish that might be missing for Nintendo but of course Nintendo could always put the resources into a little bit of that polish but they they don't see the value in it I guess
4778474	4808295	and the best part with something like this is you're going to have high resolution texture updates or mods that are going to be made for it so that you'll be able to replace that with something that looks better so yeah I'm very excited to see what they do with that and the reason why right now at least Mario Kart's hard to say but other games they have done as well in the past like this where they've reverse engineered them haven't been hit by Nintendo so far so it's you know
4808275	4810918	We'll see, but I don't know.
4810938	4814542	It's not really competing with Mario Kart World at all.
4814602	4817926	It's not, and Mario Kart 64 is on Nintendo Switch Online.
4818146	4821109	So, I mean, just let it go.
4821249	4824633	Yeah, look at how it maybe will generate some interest in Mario Kart World.
4824853	4828277	This isn't going to stop people from buying the newest Mario Kart.
4829018	4833102	I mean, I understand Nintendo has a legal obligation to protect their IPs and stuff, but...
4833925	4851124	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4861617	4869015	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4869496	4872083	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4873045	4875311	You picked a fun one for tonight, DarkSakura.
4875331	4876413	What did you pick for us tonight?
4877696	4878799	I picked Virtua Cop.
4879943	4884288	Honestly, I hadn't done it.
4884328	4886391	I was actually surprised that I haven't done it.
4887332	4887973	So here we go.
4888714	4890396	It is a game that came out in 1994.
4890536	4895602	It is a light gun shooter game that was developed and published by Sega.
4896323	4907757	It was developed for Sega Model 2 system and ported to the Saturn in 1995 and for Windows as Virtua Squad in 1996.
4908682	4924902	We will keep going a little bit more about the Saturn version in a moment, but it used real-time 3D polygon graphics with texture mapping, and Sega advertised it as the world's first texture-mapped polygon action game.
4924882	4954652	that's their words not mine and it was more of a real time sort of game where there would be different reactions from enemies based on where they were shot and what they were doing and you could shoot through glass and so this was definitely in their whole Virtua series which included Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter and Virtua Striker so
4955324	4958490	It really went on to be a big success.
4959752	4960914	Loads of people loved it.
4961295	4970751	It led to many more 3D shooter games and even more things that eventually came out on the Saturn.
4970771	4972053	I mean, there was Time Crisis.
4972094	4975780	That came out on PlayStation, which I had the gun con for that.
4975760	5002948	House of the Dead yeah and then even some of those first person shooters starting to incorporate 3D graphics so there were two sequels, there was Virtua Cop 2 and Virtua Cop 3 and it actually was bundled with Virtua Cop 2 in Japan and Europe on PS2 as Virtua Cop Elite Edition or Virtua Cop Rebirth in Japan in 2002 so
5003148	5032260	there was even an N-Gage version developed but it was cancelled there are a few beta units out there if you want to look for them but the thing with the PlayStation version is that it did have support for the gun con too so you play as police officers you play in first person you use a light gun to shoot the bad guys and try to avoid civilians and you have a
5032240	5041643	extra justice shots where you can if you disarm an enemy without killing them then you have to shoot their hand and you have bullseye shooting um
5043158	5056116	The game was developed by lead developers Itai Katsunori and Hiroyoshi Akito with Yu Suzuki.
5056376	5058559	I do names backwards, but everyone knows him as Yu Suzuki.
5059961	5061283	As the supervisor.
5062024	5069875	And it was inspired by a commercial for Poka Kilimanjaro Coffee.
5070310	5083054	The Navigator for Sega Rally Championship, Kenneth Abraham, Voices of Aliens
5083658	5110375	so the Saturn version was under development by Sega AM2 and it was one of the first ones in the Sega Graphics Library operating system along with Virtua Fighter 2 the port director Isono Takashi this is a quote we're trying to keep the quality of the arcade if three of us agree for improvement then we try to modify the graphics
5110355	5137881	so Saturn version had a full motion video sequence of the police arriving at the dockyard and apparently the designer Ohashi Kazahumi animated the bad guy Kong flipping the bird but that got rejected and Ohashi got moved to work on the training mode instead so
5138114	5166214	the playable demo was first available at Tokyo Toy Show in June of that year and they finished working on the various different levels but that third level was hardest to convert because of the office building walls and ceiling so there are nods to the game in other games so Tiger Electronics made a version of Virtual Cop for the R-Zone
5166751	5175986	The gun in Virtua Cop can be used in Ghost Squad, but it is obtained by using the IC card or Evolution versions.
5176747	5182296	And in Sega Superstars Tennis, there's a minigame based on Virtua Cop called Virtua Squad.
5182715	5210578	so Game Machine in Japan listed the arcade version in their November 1st 1994 issues being the second most successful upright cockpit cabinet arcade cabinet of the month replay labeled I can't make words happen said it was the fifth most popular arcade game in April 1995 and it became the highest grossing dedicated arcade cabinet of 1995 in Japan and one of America's best sellers
5210558	5237545	it got pretty positive reviews across the board the GamePro actually was really into the Saturn version giving it a 19.5 out of 20 so yeah, people were really into it and it is a really great game although there were some people who were like 3D polygons, is that gonna work?
5238385	5258908	you know they did some comparisons to like Lethal Enforcers for example but they it went on I mean we see where things are now um so yeah there's the Saturn version it sold over 300,000 copies in its first week of release in Japan um
5259530	5289537	and it went to 455,396 units by the end of 1994 reaching a total of 482,362 in the US it sold more than 500,000 bundled copies by December 1996 and so it sold almost a million worldwide in Japan and the United States the Saturn version had very positive reviews including the accuracy of the port
5289517	5301906	and the general gameplay but said that it lacked some longevity for the console release but yeah overall
5302578	5304021	Pretty, pretty good.
5304081	5311034	Even at EGM, all their reviewers said it was a flawless conversion, but they thought the game was too short.
5311415	5319229	PC, there was a PC version that was kind of jerkier and less intense since you couldn't use a light gun, but you could use a mouse.
5319670	5324299	And in fact, the Saturn version not just uses a light gun, it can use the Saturn mouse.
5324937	5333807	So it was a major, major influence on the light gun shooting genre and in first-person shooters.
5334688	5341655	And when people saw what was possible with, you know, polygon games, more people were into it.
5341816	5344278	You know, sometimes you got to be that first one to do it, right?
5345740	5347081	And there you go.
5348243	5350405	It's a virtual cop.
5351498	5364563	Alright, yeah, Ranmari in chat says every arcade and arcade style game is too short for professional reviewers, lol Bonds006 remembering this game in our chat This is the Saturn version I was referring to
5364762	5366665	Well, arcade style game, right?
5366745	5367667	So I get it.
5368027	5368448	Yeah.
5368468	5375980	Bons006 says, this and House of the Dead in the arcade are two games that really took my quarters, not counting the Capcom games.
5376040	5382511	And then Orange Right says, of course, the arcade game is too short reviews since you can credit feed in the home versions.
5382531	5383733	So anyway.
5383932	5398482	good pick, good pick not one I played a lot but I've definitely played this at some point in my life Virtual Cop good times our thing was really playing a lot more House of the Dead but
5399407	5405216	I mean, we were a little bit more of a Namco fan house when it came to the gun games.
5405597	5406639	I hear ya, I hear ya.
5407961	5414091	Alright, well let's hit on a few more headlines from this week's gaming news in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5414111	5414732	Loki.
5415826	5423894	Alright, well, got some leaks coming out about Marvel Rivals Season 3, thanks to Twitch promo posts.
5424775	5439529	They unfortunately announced Phoenix and Blade are going to be coming as new characters for Season 3, as well as there's going to be new Venomized costumes that are going to be coming as well.
5439549	5445175	So, I guess look forward to that soon, when they officially announce it.
5446437	5447398	What else?
5447479	5452706	We've got... You know, I asked this question to myself before.
5453047	5454529	What is Black Ops anymore?
5454569	5455851	What is Call of Duty anymore?
5455971	5457173	Is it just Fortnite?
5457193	5459236	I think we're just Fortnite now.
5459256	5460718	A miserable little pile of secrets.
5461038	5467288	Serious, like, you know, it was pretty arcade-y, but still a pretty serious war game.
5467308	5468209	And now we have what?
5469134	5472199	We had Jay and Silent Bob.
5473341	5476305	We've had and we now have Beavis and Butthead.
5476345	5479170	Wasn't Nicki Minaj in one of them or something?
5479250	5480231	I swear that was a thing.
5480431	5481453	I might as well.
5481834	5483316	I might as well.
5483336	5483897	Of course.
5483997	5484358	Yeah.
5485079	5489185	So I'm sure I'm sure there's like, you know.
5489840	5490421	things.
5492004	5494148	But anyways, yeah, so Beavis and Butthead are coming.
5494389	5508355	They're going to have two new maps, two new weapons, some weapon balancing changes, new Black Ops 6 zombie mode, and new events for Season 4.
5509651	5510232	I don't care.
5511494	5512675	I just don't.
5512695	5514458	That's how I feel about this series.
5516060	5517762	Seriously, it's like, oh, it's Fortnite.
5518363	5520987	DarkTetsuya says, Beavis and Butthead made me laugh.
5521087	5523110	We're really trusting them with guns?
5523130	5525613	Well, look at this country, my friend.
5527516	5531001	Anyway, on that depressing note, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5533175	5535278	Well, I'm sad.
5535338	5540884	Cotton Reboot High Tension is delayed.
5540904	5541585	I'm going to cry.
5543567	5547152	It has been delayed until July 31st in Japan, so it's just a one week delay.
5548473	5549014	I'll see it.
5549034	5555882	Well, you know what they say, a bad game is bad forever, but a good game... Barf.
5557023	5558105	Just one week.
5558185	5562490	And then I can do like in a
5563027	5574252	Rainbow Cotton She's addicted to candy that makes her throw up I mean, mood
5575008	5579815	Uh, let's talk about PlayStation Plus free games.
5579835	5586104	Well, free with an asterisk because you have to be a PlayStation Plus member in order to get the free games.
5586144	5588808	The big whopper for July is Diablo 4.
5588908	5589288	That's right.
5589308	5590550	Diablo 4 will be free.
5590951	5595898	So if you have yet to jump in on the Diablo 4 hype train or you don't have Game Pass, here's your chance.
5595998	5596679	It's coming out.
5596699	5599463	But there's a big asterisk.
5599443	5609800	I noticed they don't point out that I think you should know is that Diablo 4 has an expansion and the expansion is not a part of this giveaway from what I can say.
5609820	5612525	I think they would have been pretty clear that they'd be giving away the expansion.
5612545	5621860	So you can have the base Diablo 4 game and you get that for free and that I'm going to imagine is just enough to try and get you hooked to decide to spend money on the expansion.
5621880	5623122	But I will say...
5623102	5641684	The King of Fighters 15
5642525	5644048	You can check that out.
5644108	5656468	And then just for PlayStation 5, an action puzzle climbing game called Jusant, which I'm not familiar with, but I can get familiar with it when it goes to the July 2025 monthly games lineup.
5657590	5658031	Let's see.
5658632	5662759	I was trying to also look for, I guess they're doing some other types of activities.
5662779	5664361	There's some online tournaments they're doing.
5664401	5666765	It's all sports games and Tekken 8.
5667326	5669089	Sony Pictures stuff.
5669069	5689238	through August 12th you can get discounts on movies they're having a free well it's over I was gonna say they're having a free multiplayer weekend but it's just about over tonight and there are still some savings on some PlayStation games until the end of tonight Civ 7 is one of them Star Wars Outlaws I still need to pick those up so neat
5689623	5695113	Alright, well, if you decide not to buy those games on sale, why don't you check out some upcoming games?
5695153	5697437	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5697517	5699260	Loki, what's coming out in the US?
5699360	5700523	Not a lot.
5700583	5701064	Not a lot.
5701785	5702727	We're in July.
5702767	5704289	Slow time of the year.
5704390	5705792	Well, it's a holiday week, too.
5706312	5708016	That is also true.
5708136	5717836	So we've got Angerfoot on PlayStation 5, Irem Collection Volume 3 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5718557	5724810	Finally, so I don't have to see the stupid trailers anymore, Mecha Break on PC and Xbox Series.
5724790	5729415	We have Firmament on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5730055	5735581	And then Harvest Moon, The Lost Valley, and Harvest Moon, Skytree Village on Nintendo Switch.
5736361	5738924	And that's it.
5738984	5740786	Japan has nothing.
5740806	5741346	I'm not sure why.
5741386	5743949	There's no new releases of Note in Japan this week.
5745370	5746431	That's it.
5746451	5749675	There's some accessories, but those aren't games.
5750295	5754139	They'll pick up again on the 10th of July, but for this week, nothing.
5754220	5756044	DarkSakura, what about the game?
5756064	5773242	I had to look around because my usual source didn't say anything for the first week of July but I did find from Metro.co.uk they said on July 1st there's Mecha Break for the Xbox's PC and Echo Paradox for PC
5773998	5784489	Alright, I think we have just one more news story for you and then we'll get to maybe some last minute stories and then the listener roundtable if you have anything you want to ask.
5784529	5785770	We'll take your questions in chat.
5785810	5790715	We also are known to take calls through our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
5790795	5795420	If you want to join the green room, we'll try to fit in some voice calls as well tonight.
5795440	5798503	But first, Loki has another bit of news for us.
5799226	5814079	Yep, so the Minecraft Killer Hytale, which was created by Hypixel Studios, they're also, I think that Hypixel is also a...
5815088	5822120	Minecraft server that's very popular, but they're trying to spin off their own Minecraft as well, called Hytale.
5822180	5834582	It's been in development for almost 10 years, started in 2018, and they even had support from Riot as well, but now it's officially been cancelled.
5834562	5842230	they announced on the 23rd that over time as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us the bar kept rising.
5842310	5852081	Our technical ambitions grew more and more complex and even after a major reboot of the game engine the team found that Hytale still wasn't far along as it needed to be.
5852742	5858248	So it sounded like a scope creep quite a bit and also taking a long time.
5858648	5860991	It's Duke Nukem Forever all over again.
5861371	5863033	You're trying to develop a game but the
5863790	5866155	The technology is going too fast.
5866215	5867999	It's just evolving too quickly.
5868560	5875615	And 10 years for a Minecraft clone is... I mean, it did look a little bit different, but yeah.
5875635	5878060	It's just... What are you going to do?
5878441	5880946	Yep.
5880966	5882189	All right.
5882209	5884313	Well, with that... Excuse me.
5885525	5904883	Just garbage.
5905218	5911086	If you want to send us an email for a future week, participate at OrangeLawnsRadio.com Was there more garbage in there?
5911206	5916453	I actually went in that mailbox at like 5 o'clock, no, 2 o'clock and cleaned it out 100%.
5917214	5920438	So any more garbage got sent in like the last 4 hours.
5920458	5920999	So annoying.
5921039	5921319	Yes.
5922881	5925325	I'm gonna have to look at one of my resources.
5925345	5925485	Ugh.
5927247	5928429	Alright.
5928549	5932474	Well, Loki, let me check in with you and see if there's any last minute stories, things you want to talk about tonight.
5933011	5962427	just one that apparently Death Stranding 2 is causing some Playstation 5s to overheat apparently when you pause the game and bring up the map screen the fans suddenly go crazy into overdrive and you get an overheat warning apparently a new patch was released recently but it doesn't sound like it's resolved the problem so I don't know if it's affecting a lot of people but yeah that sucks
5963673	5968144	I do want to check out Death Stranding 2, but I feel an obligation to actually beat the first game first.
5969588	5969869	You know?
5970310	5970590	So.
5970991	5972054	Yeah.
5972074	5973658	We'll get to it eventually.
5973678	5974300	But there's just so many.
5974360	5977969	But Fantasy Life and other games in my backlog.
5978725	5982171	and games that never stop, like Final Fantasy XIV, Diablo, you name it.
5982191	5985776	There's just so many games as a service that keep serving.
5986878	5996834	Yeah, I wanted to play more Mario Kart World this week, but I ain't bringing a Switch 2 on a plane and trusting that it doesn't get stolen by somebody.
5996854	5997936	You know, no thanks.
5997956	5999859	That's how you bring it in your carry-on.
5999999	6003825	I understand that, but even if it goes through, like, you know, I don't know.
6003866	6005408	I just still don't trust any...
6005388	6008154	I brought mine all the way to Atlanta and never touched it.
6008174	6009897	I was like, oh, Bobby and I will play some Mario.
6009918	6010098	Nope.
6010679	6011240	Never happened.
6011721	6012222	Never happened.
6012483	6013024	But it's fine.
6014146	6016511	Yeah, and I didn't even end up playing it on the plane either.
6016592	6017714	I just kind of slept.
6019137	6019838	I didn't even watch movies.
6019858	6021001	Usually I watch movies on the plane.
6021021	6022384	I didn't even really do that this time.
6022464	6023566	I just slept.
6023586	6023987	So...
6025537	6035080	But I will tell you, I finally, I sprung to get the, not first class, I wish, but you know how there's the comfort plus, the extra legroom seats?
6035542	6036364	It's worth it.
6036384	6037386	It's worth it.
6038125	6039507	I lucked out both times.
6039808	6044735	So we flew twice, obviously, down and back from San Diego.
6045035	6049622	And both times, I lucked out as a full plane.
6050844	6053068	They say full plane, but it's not really a full plane.
6053468	6055331	There's like one or two seats open.
6055732	6060238	The first time, my entire row was completely empty other than me.
6060579	6061981	The rest of the plane was completely full.
6062542	6064605	And then the second time...
6064585	6066187	There was no one sitting next to me.
6066227	6068549	I was on the window side, but the middle seat was empty.
6068970	6071552	So both times, I had room to stretch out.
6071572	6073214	And this was a Southwest flight?
6073414	6074736	Southwest, yeah.
6074756	6075957	I just looked at both times.
6075997	6079941	Southwest has like seven flights a day between SAC and San Diego, so wow.
6079961	6086067	Yeah, we just sat in the back, and so it just worked out.
6086088	6086748	It was funny.
6086768	6087089	Perfect.
6087529	6092314	Yeah, but if you drive, you can stop by the Bravo Cheese Farm.
6094150	6095152	Oh my gosh.
6095172	6098377	Yeah, I want to make that drive, what, 12 hours or whatever?
6098678	6099499	Yeah, no thanks.
6099519	6101383	It was only 10, and it was fine.
6101583	6103747	Keep in mind, he's got the restless kids in the back, too.
6103767	6108174	Even if they're getting to a more adult age, they're still going to be like, I gotta go to the bathroom.
6108194	6109096	It's not even that.
6109296	6110078	Kidding, kidding.
6110198	6112041	No, it's just we have...
6112021	6121072	We have, like, my wife needs to stop every once in a while because of the Crohn's and everything, so we have to be near rest stops and stuff.
6121092	6123134	It's just, a long drive like that's really rough.
6123234	6128541	Jesus Christ, your oldest is going to be able to drive next year, isn't he?
6128641	6130103	He's going to be 15 this year.
6130583	6131264	Oh my god.
6131504	6132626	In Mississippi, he can drive.
6133607	6140235	But, yeah, so, like, I had to rent, what was it, a what was it?
6140255	6141977	It was a Hyundai...
6143628	6145051	Oh gosh, I don't remember now.
6145371	6145792	A Honda.
6146794	6147475	Yeah, it was a Honda.
6147495	6153406	It was a big ol' much bigger of a car than I'm used to driving, so that was fun.
6153426	6155029	Felt like I was driving a boat the entire time.
6155711	6157013	It's all fancy and new.
6157381	6163768	Uh, Loki, the game that's playing behind you tonight, I didn't ask about it earlier, but is this that game that's all the rage on, like, Twitch and stuff right now?
6163808	6164188	Peak?
6164208	6164669	Yeah.
6164689	6165350	Yeah, it's Peak.
6165430	6166511	It's the one I played earlier.
6166611	6167732	Yeah, it's a mountain climbing game.
6167752	6176982	You're, like, scouts or whatever, and you're playing crashes, and you have to, like, help each other, like, climb a mountain, and, like, it kind of has, like, five different sections in there.
6177342	6187253	They start off in, like, kind of a beachy area, which is kind of getting used to the game, and then they have a jungly thing with rain that makes stuff slippery, and, uh,
6187233	6191700	One that is in snow that you have to hide from the wind or otherwise you'll freeze.
6192020	6196126	And you have to do that without eating your party?
6196347	6198149	Yeah, you can't eat the party.
6198209	6202416	You can eat food that you find in suitcases that are strewn about the mountain.
6202476	6209687	And it's randomly generated in the sense that they generate a new island either every day or every... I don't know.
6209727	6213192	It's several hours that they regenerate the island.
6213252	6216717	So you can play the same island over and over, but it...
6216950	6218613	Changes every once in a while.
6218633	6219374	Huh.
6219394	6219755	Interesting.
6219995	6220937	But it's Landfall games.
6220977	6225786	I love Landfall, you know, ever since, like, Cluster Truck and stuff like that.
6225806	6230614	Uh, SSJ100Matt had brought up in chat, Steam's summer sale going on to add to your backlog.
6230915	6232678	Has anyone fallen prey to that yet?
6232718	6234120	I've managed to hold off so far.
6234301	6235944	Yes.
6236064	6237827	I'm hovering over Hades, too.
6238168	6239710	Ooh, good pick.
6240071	6241253	Good pick.
6241553	6270514	but things are what they are and someone else bought me I was going to say I considered Oblivion Remastered but it's only 20% off so I'm just waiting for a deeper discount someone else acquired a certain Dead by Daylight chapter for me oh okay because I'm not giving any of my money I'm not playing any of it on stream but I did get my Adept just to get it out of the way right
6271338	6275543	And I'm sure you can't control what killers you go against.
6277425	6278366	Yeah.
6278386	6283512	I mean, it was okay.
6283532	6285475	I just really didn't enjoy it.
6286916	6290621	Yeah, check out To a T. I meant to play more of that this week.
6290641	6291882	It's such a lovely game.
6292723	6294105	I do want Date Everything.
6294743	6297049	Yeah, I've been asked about Date Everything.
6297109	6298854	That looks like a game I'd be into.
6298894	6300839	And there's so many good voice actors in there.
6300859	6302182	I saw the trailer so long ago.
6304629	6305070	All right.
6305431	6307015	I still have my Pallia.
6307265	6309048	I think we'll go ahead and wrap it up.
6309068	6313656	I think we're about done for this week and that's fine because my voice is giving out as y'all can hear.
6313696	6316100	So we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
6316120	6316721	Thank you always.
6316741	6317482	Be less sick.
6317502	6318003	Thank you.
6318043	6318745	I'm trying.
6318765	6319706	I'm trying.
6319786	6321730	Thank you as always for listening to Originals Radio.
6321750	6323012	Thank you for downloading our show.
6323032	6326638	We are the show where every gamer has a voice but we need more voices to put out on air.
6326718	6328221	So tell a friend or two about the show.
6328261	6329543	Help us spread the word.
6329523	6334991	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show goes an awful long way.
6335412	6337374	Yes, I do see the YouTube comments.
6337555	6341841	So I saw, did I read that YouTube comment from, I think it was from a week or two ago?
6343163	6350133	Hold on, I gotta find it, because it was really, was that the one where they said, no, maybe that was an email I was thinking of.
6350153	6350554	Hold on.
6351495	6355060	This is important if it's what I'm thinking of.
6355120	6355781	Where's the comments?
6355862	6356863	Oh, here it is, here it is, here it is.
6359678	6364630	So we had a comment on our last episode, which was from June 15th, episode 1051.
6365372	6368700	And this comment was from RememberTheAlamo2885.
6368860	6376860	There is no basement at the Alamo.
6377667	6382453	Remember the Alamo in the basement.
6382473	6383014	I fucking love it.
6383034	6385617	I need to watch that Pee Wee Herman documentary so bad.
6386057	6386418	So bad.
6386998	6389842	Anyway, remember... Oh, they also have the Jim Varney one too.
6389862	6390523	Have you seen that?
6390883	6391324	No.
6391704	6393887	The Jim Varney documentary?
6394167	6397251	Well, let me get to the comment here from Remember the Alamo.
6397631	6398853	Holy shit.
6398873	6402257	I can't believe you guys are still doing this podcast.
6402237	6407806	I remember listening to you guys on my RSS feed for my Gen 1 PSP back in 2006.
6408106	6414616	I didn't even know what a podcast was and I would download your episodes to listen while I went to sleep, lol.
6415037	6418743	I didn't really understand what you guys were talking about because I was so young then.
6419384	6423250	I was 12 then and now 31.
6427752	6429617	But loved hearing all three of your voices.
6429677	6430418	Very soothing.
6430839	6432283	Very nostalgic and simple.
6432343	6433586	Great time in my life.
6433747	6436393	Keep it going, guys, and do what you love.
6436453	6437055	Well, thank you for that.
6437075	6438538	I even gave it a little heart and a thumbs up.
6438598	6440142	So there you go.
6441607	6467732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6467712	6475242	So Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays are going to be my Dead by Daylight days with Saturday, Sunday for Mass Effect.
6476123	6480749	My Tuesday, though, might change if I take that third ballet class.
6480770	6482111	So we'll see.
6483273	6484535	We'll see what happens.
6484555	6486077	Fair enough.
6486097	6489822	It might end up becoming a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday thing.
6489982	6490422	I don't know.
6490603	6495649	But if anyone, you know, if anyone cares, there you go.
6496691	6496791	Yeah.
6498627	6503475	Alright, well, we will hop on over to your stream in just a little bit.
6503495	6506860	Alrighty, well, as soon as Mass Effect updates.
6506880	6507702	Alright.
6508263	6511307	Hey, everybody, y'all are awesome.
6512409	6513511	Alright, have a good one, Jamie.
6513531	6514893	We'll see you in a little bit.
6515394	6515674	You too.
6515695	6515975	Bye.
6516596	6518219	Then, Loki, I think we're over to you.
6518779	6522085	What's your... Why are all my... Oh, wait, maybe I need to do that.
6522145	6522566	There we go.
6523607	6524228	So annoying.
6524288	6525951	Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight.
6526808	6547602	my final thought is I have to work on more Minecraft stuff I'm trying to get my modded series going I was waiting for somebody to port over a mod for me and I don't think it's working out so thankfully I found an alternative but yeah that's kind of annoying
6548628	6554136	Alright, and my final thought is, I completely neglected to talk about Pokemon Go Fest today.
6554998	6560987	I went out to San Francisco yesterday to play, and I went to Pride out there for a little bit, just to check it out, because I hadn't been in years.
6561007	6565273	And I had a pretty good day getting shiny yesterday.
6565293	6566355	Today was hot.
6566375	6567376	I had to play here in SAC.
6567416	6568979	It was 100 degrees today.
6568999	6571142	This was very hot, and I didn't get to play the entire time.
6571443	6575749	But I did, so even though I had less time, I caught two shiny Zacians.
6576387	6602158	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkDragon
6602138	6604180	Otherwise, I hope everybody had a happy pride.
6604581	6608966	I saw some chat about that earlier, so I hope you all had a good one celebrating and all that good stuff.
6608986	6615433	And yeah, hopefully July will be okay.
6615453	6616574	Have a good week, everybody.
6616654	6618696	We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6618716	6619357	Have a great night.
6619377	6624222	Thank you so much for watching or listening, downloading, all that stuff.
6624242	6625043	We'll see you next week.
6625063	6627706	Bye.
6627726	6630289	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6632075	6660732	See you next week.
