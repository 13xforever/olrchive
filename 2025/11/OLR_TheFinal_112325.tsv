9818	14604	My rule for these intros is not to bite off the lead story, but tonight is nearly all about the lead story.
14784	18709	The story of 23 and a half years that chronicles the evolution of a broadcast.
18729	21032	From PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 5 Pro.
21052	23255	From DDR Solo 2000 to DDR World Tour.
23455	25297	From Guitar Freaks to Fortnite Festival.
25317	28741	23 and a half Guinness record-setting years of gaming news.
28761	30844	Take a bow and a drink.
30864	34609	It's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you all about it.
34629	37412	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39653	42779	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42939	49130	Welcome back one more time to the show where every gamer has a voice.
49150	51334	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
51454	59629	We are live tonight, November the 23rd of 2025 with this, our final episode tonight, OLR The Final.
60090	62033	Been in the works since...
62013	80663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
80643	106144	and Jamie Summers.
108014	110979	In the flesh tonight, even.
113443	116928	Except that it's not coming through on the mic, unfortunately.
116948	119672	What would a final show be without some final... The fuck?
119753	120193	There we go.
120273	120554	Hey!
121595	123318	Well, an appropriate first word.
124059	127064	I'm on camera until I cry my makeup off.
127825	129187	I've also come prepared.
129788	134075	I have... You can't really see the etching, but it's an N7 etched glass.
134937	135237	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
135588	137390	and I have a beer.
137991	141835	And if you look behind me, I've trapped Midna in the office.
141855	145279	That's right, Midna the kitty joining us here tonight as well.
145660	147161	And also, damn it, Grandpa.
147582	155671	Yeah, so you mentioned that Matt from Horde House or Grandpa got you a present and I was sitting here going, he didn't send me anything.
156232	159235	Well, apparently something did just get delivered.
159315	163620	That's your cue, Alan Alchemy, because I don't even know what it is.
163988	185760	How much pumpkin spice is in it?
186415	188137	I'm okay.
188558	189059	I look a mess.
189239	189740	That's okay.
190060	190561	Hi, Alan.
190621	192604	My ever-loving husband is here for the last episode.
192964	194026	Hi, Alan.
194106	195387	I don't see flowers.
195407	196189	No, hold on.
196389	199373	It's a story in two parts.
199553	200474	Okay, a story in two parts.
200495	201796	You're not doing the podcast anymore.
202898	204059	Well, I'm doing the podcast tonight.
204260	205842	Well, I mean, after this.
205862	209227	So you're of no use to him, so he wants to kill you.
209747	211770	Are you... Grandpa!
212211	212711	Grandpa!
212972	213132	Grandpa!
214647	216610	I have diabetes.
217913	219656	Why would you send me?
222200	223022	You dumbass.
223182	226127	What kind of gift is this?
226207	228451	It's the gift you bring over to Jamie's house.
228732	236966	For the podcast listeners, this is a bunch of small trick-or-treat sale Snickers, Twix, Milky Way type of assorted thing here.
237848	239811	I'll be donating that to the homeless, I guess.
239791	242153	Oh, yay, flowers for my funeral.
242754	243354	Oh, I love it.
243414	244155	Thank you.
244595	246437	No, in all seriousness, I do appreciate it.
246657	252643	Also, I am in love with these lavender roses and I am going to press them.
252663	256166	Put the candy away from my equipment.
256186	261651	I will have to make sure that the lilies stay far away from Midna because every lily breed is poisonous to cats.
262752	263853	But she will not come up here.
264174	264814	Oh, yeah.
265335	269038	If those are lilies, Alan, keep them away from the cats.
272933	274274	They're too fat to get on the countertop.
274475	274875	That's true.
274915	275436	That is true.
275456	276397	They're not going to get on the countertop.
276417	281582	Yeah, but Midna, even though she goes, I'm old lady!
282343	282523	No.
282823	285105	She will get up and smell everything.
285125	288329	But right now, it is very full up on my desk.
288769	291111	Oh, they're so pretty.
291412	294955	This is the same color as the skirt I got married in.
296897	297037	Oh.
297898	301021	You know, all three of us got married during the course of this program.
301982	302603	Yes, we did.
302633	305581	Yeah, so, love that.
305601	309231	Also, it's kind of ace colors, a little bit, the white and the purple.
309251	310274	I was actually thinking that.
310294	314466	I was wondering if he planned that to Summer Guard when he did that, so...
314716	317779	But yeah, you're here in the flesh, DarkSakura.
317799	319641	It is great to see you tonight.
319881	325006	And thank you for beating your face for the show tonight.
325026	326588	She's full coverage tonight.
326908	333114	Hey, I ran the razor and trimmed my beard up, but I was threatening online.
333234	338099	I was like, ooh, should I go full 2007 Britney Spears and shave my beard off?
338119	342563	I'm already bald, so I can't shave my head, but maybe shave my beard off as like a...
342543	343505	Thanksgiving Crisis.
343525	344527	That's something I'm thinking about doing.
344848	346731	Loki, what do you say?
347112	354427	Let's turn No Shave November into, not to take away from any charity causes or anything that month is about, but let's do things different and make it Shave Our Beards November.
354507	355830	What do you think?
355850	356711	No.
356732	358014	I already shaved today.
358114	359978	I can't wear my next beard.
360768	361390	You know what?
361591	361972	You know what?
361992	363035	You know what?
363296	363757	I shaved.
364700	365422	Good, good.
365543	366486	At least one of us did.
367388	373427	Actually, I do like once a month shave my face with a dermaplane.
373998	403549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
403529	404931	Thank you.
405052	408818	Just a big thank you to everybody who's saying hello.
408898	410160	Just pulling out some comments here.
410501	413706	Also, I recognize the Level 6 hype train that just happened in chat.
413726	415950	I don't usually read all those things out on air tonight.
416491	420758	We are going to do things a little different at the end of our show tonight, so I do want to caution you.
420798	423883	Unfortunately, I will not be taking the time to read every
423863	427767	VOG is forever.
428048	430430	Kneel before VOG!
430490	450613	That was our old thing.
450593	452316	Angel!
452676	469463	Angel!
469443	477153	If tonight's show feels a little more unstructured and a little more unhinged, whatever you want, that's because it is.
477393	481358	We already mentioned last week, we wanted to end with episode 1069.
481759	482039	Nice.
483181	486004	As far as the news and the normal stuff goes.
486024	489549	So tonight really is just taking a trip back down memory lane.
489890	491632	We have a few things for you.
491652	493314	Maybe we have a few surprises for you.
493334	495477	So we hope you'll stay till the very end.
495657	497239	Drew, the ferret died finally.
499227	523497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
523696	548505	um how is how is this for an old throwback to a meme no one cur well but you and I were on the bar with him and he was there for the discussion I'm curious and I also saw what really bad photoshopping looks like I I wish him health and wellness I don't you know I hope he's doing well whatever the fuck he's doing but um he was there for that initial conversation but you and I still
548485	556415	I don't even remember how it started, but you and I sort of were like, why didn't we do that sort of thing that we have going with it?
556476	558959	Was it because we knew Travis was leaving at that point?
559059	560581	I don't think we did.
560601	563124	Because things were running parallel for a little bit.
563204	576602	If you think I'm busy now and getting to that point where I'm like, time to free up my weekend, I was doing Under Sedation Live on Saturday nights, and then I was going to Rocky Horror, and then I was doing Orange Lounge Radio on Sunday nights.
576582	582515	I was doing Under Sedation with you at the very end.
582535	583738	Oh yeah, at the very end, yeah.
584800	587927	Yeah, and Jessica was doing DDR Freak Radio at the time.
588047	595283	Well, and that was funny because you knew that we were starting Orange Launch Radio and you knew about DDR Freak Radio.
595263	599649	But neither one of because and I've been very transparent about this since then.
599669	602554	Jessica and I at the time were not speaking to each other.
602574	605959	Our friendship was in a hard place and we were not speaking to each other.
606219	612188	So we we were developing these things in tandem and Jamie knew about both while she was balancing her personal friendships.
612569	617676	But it was funny because you sort of had to play that role of like nudging us to be different.
617656	634365	and that's why for those that don't know that's why when Orange Launch Radio started as a live 365 station so we didn't start as a podcast we started as a live 365 station that would play Bomani music not just DDR but 2DX and more
634345	641992	We took the Dance Mania albums that a lot of the early DDR music came from and songs that we thought should be in DDR.
642112	644134	I don't remember what our theming was around that.
644154	644814	We had a thing.
645915	649198	We had a little bit more of a diversity to our playlist.
650219	652942	To DDR Freaks Radio credit, because I'm not going to shade what they were doing.
652962	654503	They did a great thing at that time.
654804	661029	They were a complete DDR archive of music, whereas ours was more curated.
661610	661990	Yeah.
661970	664196	It allowed us to do our different things.
664557	671397	And it was really interesting because even though we launched right around the same time and we ran in tandem, we had our own listeners, we had the own thing.
671417	674646	And then it did get to a point, Jessica and I
675385	694795	Mended Fences and we're cool now everything's everything's cool with us um and um we were able to work together towards the end of DDR Freak because DDR Freak as a whole closed I don't even remember what year it was but it was it was a while um it was a while we had been to what two or three E3s by then mm-hmm
695787	697410	Yeah, that's right.
697450	701516	JD says the radio station was how I discovered OLR because we started partnering up at the end.
701536	703960	They would syndicate Orange Lounge Radio.
703980	717121	So we would do our thing on Sunday and then they played the episodes on Monday or Tuesday because it got to a point, thanks to some of our friends that worked at Konami and some of the friends, we started debuting DDR music on our live show, which was a really cool thing.
717161	722470	And I'm very grateful to this day that we got to debut the Ultramix 4 soundtrack here on this show.
722450	738923	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
738903	748968	And I want to say Echo Image was number one or number two, because we were all fanboys, fangirls, fan people of Echo Image back in the day.
749449	750993	So they were number one or number two.
751013	753760	And I want to say maybe, yeah, well, let me get to that, DarkSakura.
755023	755123	Yeah.
755558	758542	So yeah, we had a great partnership with DDR Free Radio.
758762	760945	And then podcasting kind of became a thing.
761626	766673	And we got into, we were doing our live show on Live 365.
767394	771159	And we started doing, and if tonight's show seems scatterbrained, it's because it is.
771199	773883	It's an emotional mess, it's scatterbrained, and it's ADHD.
773943	777167	Put all of that together and you got a hot mess.
778509	781313	So you...
781293	784757	We split off into the podcast and was doing that for a little while.
785938	790364	A little while, just like 18 years or so, however, to get us to where we're at today.
790384	793167	But we were doing the podcast separately from the live show.
793187	795890	So we did the podcast for what was supposed to be 20 minutes.
796250	797932	Do you remember the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition?
798493	804600	It was 20 minutes we taped after the live show that was about all video games.
804580	819855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
820814	849842	and you went to the ceremony yeah I did in San Diego I got to see my sister who was stationed well she was out but her husband at the time was stationed in Coronado and I got to see my brother who was at Camp Pendleton nice because he was still enlisted he was still in the Marines so that was a fun little trip for you and I went to the zoo yeah
850480	852404	Coronado is pretty.
852424	854048	I'm like, I want to I like Coronado.
854188	854810	It's expensive.
856293	865975	So at some point, the podcast part got longer and longer and then iTunes launched podcasting and we were in there day one in the podcast directory.
865955	869462	And that just, like, our exposure went through the roof.
869542	874351	That's when the news came out and did a bit on Governor Schwarzenegger's getting into podcasting.
874391	876856	Here's some local nerds who've been podcasting for a bit now.
877156	877938	You know, and that whole thing.
877978	880322	It's still, that thing's still on YouTube.
880663	881945	And there's that.
882065	883508	And then...
883488	890259	So we had that, but it became, it started to become, we were taping for like four and a half hours on a Sunday night.
890800	893083	And remember the show was in person.
893103	897210	So DarkSakura and Loki were driving to the apartment I lived in at the time.
897230	902818	And some of that may have overlapped with when it was at Jamie's house and I drove to Jamie's house, but there was a little bit of driving involved.
902838	904181	That's a long Sunday night.
904641	907826	So finally, at some point we said, all right, we're going to merge these two things.
908127	909529	And Shermie was your foot warmer.
909509	910511	Yes, yes.
910531	917842	There wasn't a lot of DDR talk happening and, you know, because Konami waited years to put out a new game.
918163	926556	And so we said, you know what, let's just kind of merge a lot of the things we've learned from doing live show with what we've learned doing the podcast and we'll do our live show as a podcast.
926536	949742	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
949722	968473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
968453	970315	Which for us, no big deal, right?
970335	971897	Our show wasn't until Sunday.
971917	973539	But for everybody else, they had to hold on the press.
973659	978485	And then it turned out one outlet got to spill the Metal Gear Solid thing early.
979065	983270	One outlet got to spill the Karaoke Country Revolution or whatever else was there early.
983551	988657	And you saw how they... I kind of thought that was kind of dirty, but it's whatever.
988697	990759	It's what the industry is sometimes for coverage.
991059	994984	But nobody had the DDR thing.
994964	998387	And when that news came out, that's all we talked about.
998427	999829	And we had it on our website.
999889	1002651	Thank you to Dekeman, who built our website at the time.
1002671	1003732	It was newer stuff.
1003752	1008597	And we had the DDR song list and all that stuff was on there.
1009177	1013842	And that got us a lot of looks, too, because nobody was under NDA for that.
1014002	1017646	And we didn't care as much about the other stuff as we did that.
1018306	1020568	So we got the jump on that, and that was a lot of fun.
1021189	1021309	Yeah.
1021289	1024654	It's okay, Naoki got to watch me play the game, so... That's right.
1025175	1025735	That's right.
1026396	1029541	I just still remember... Oh my god.
1030883	1031283	Wow.
1031304	1034829	I'm like, right now I'm flooded and overwhelmed thinking about E3 2006.
1034909	1039295	Oh yeah, E3... I have that picture of us.
1039315	1047167	E3 2006 was wild, and I'm looking at Justin's comment in chat, hello, saying, I remember meeting you guys at E3 in like 2006 and being totally starstruck.
1047227	1048208	Dude...
1048188	1050292	You helped me cut the Wii line.
1051173	1055761	I was obsessed with you because you got me to cut the line.
1056202	1057284	I was so happy about that.
1057684	1064536	And that is such an ironic statement considering I know where your path took you, Justin, through everything.
1064556	1067241	It's very humbling and very kind of you to say that.
1067261	1068804	But yeah, I forgot about that.
1068924	1069605	I didn't.
1069585	1070947	That was huge.
1070967	1073550	You helped me cut that gigantic fucking line to go see the Wii.
1074090	1076153	And I super appreciate that.
1076373	1083322	Always know, when I saw you doing the other work that you did in your career, you can tell people who you are if you want.
1084683	1088988	I was so proud of you when I saw all that, what you were up to and what you were doing.
1089609	1092913	And I never forgot that kind gesture in 2006.
1092953	1094395	So thank you, thank you.
1094915	1098262	Yeah, got to meet at DragonCon, says PodCulture.
1098362	1103312	Yeah, DragonCon is an amazing family.
1103332	1107319	One of these days, I'll get DarkSakura and Loki to go, even if the show's ending.
1108442	1110325	I sent you that picture of us, by the way.
1110646	1111708	Okay, don't...
1111688	1112329	It's there!
1113652	1115054	Why am I still getting alert?
1115515	1121165	Sorry if you're getting Discord alerts, but those are supposed to be suppressed during the show.
1121245	1122387	I don't know why they're coming through.
1122407	1123009	I didn't hear anything.
1123489	1124832	It's coming through on my end, but that's alright.
1125994	1126575	Anyway.
1127298	1129142	Um, where was I?
1129162	1129924	We got all distracted.
1130024	1134735	Oh, I never talked about... Well, we got to the... We talked about the awards and we talked about E3 2006.
1135296	1140087	But an important thing that happened in between that point was our partnership with All Games Radio.
1141009	1144176	Because, you know, we were going to be... Well...
1144156	1146840	So Bobby told it on his show and I think he forgot.
1146880	1148283	That's okay.
1148523	1155334	Because Bobby, I'll talk about how great Bobby is later in this and working with us for literally 20 years.
1156937	1162165	Bobby had us syndicated on All Games Radio for about a year as well.
1162145	1182128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1182108	1201635	and yeah I know we didn't stay there for the entirety of our run but we had some great memories and some great years with All Games Radio and working with the folks and then when Live 365 was like we're gonna like triple our fees because of and it wasn't their fault it was what the government was doing with royalty fees and everything we said you know what
1201615	1220923	and DarkSakura.com.
1220903	1221905	to an extent.
1221925	1223709	And that was huge for both of our stations.
1223769	1225654	And I think it was great.
1225674	1228921	And I'm really thankful to the new audience who got through that to this day.
1228941	1233952	And that takes me to E3 2006, where DarkSakura sent that picture.
1235015	1237039	Was this E3 2006?
1237407	1238249	I think that was.
1239031	1240896	Or maybe the year after, but I think it was 2006.
1240936	1243964	Sorry, it's going to take me a minute to bring this up for the podcast folks.
1244646	1246390	I'm sorry, for the folks listening live.
1246450	1253408	And for the podcast folks, you won't be able to see it, sorry, but it's a picture of a very young Rob with hair.
1253388	1259338	and DarkSakura at, you can see the ESA thing in the back there, but that's us at E3 2006.
1259679	1260440	Oh yeah, it is.
1260740	1261902	You can actually see it in the background.
1261922	1263104	Yeah, E3 2006.
1263164	1264326	Yeah, that was us.
1264527	1266129	Yeah, that was us.
1266470	1270637	But that was also the year that All Games Radio did the whole
1270617	1275345	That was great.
1276327	1286584	I felt like a professional.
1286564	1288367	That was the first time I felt pro.
1288467	1288727	I know.
1288808	1291011	I kind of felt like a rock star a little bit.
1291031	1291552	A little bit.
1292373	1297641	I mean, we were with a lot of other people that were in the same boat we were, but that was a really cool year.
1297661	1299644	So I really appreciated that for sure.
1300786	1302088	Absolutely.
1302469	1303551	Absolutely.
1303991	1305814	Mike Def says, Ginger Rob.
1305854	1306054	Yep.
1306115	1309119	Before I went gray, I actually had hair and it was red.
1309139	1310922	So you can actually see my old hair color.
1311763	1314107	I guess it was still dying her hair red back then.
1314087	1340719	uh Burr11 says same found you from all games haven't been around but had to dip in for this last episode thanks for getting me through a lot of work days over the years thank you for that thank you thank you thank you um yeah Rob the red turned Rob the white dude COVID did a number on all of us all right and and so for the record you can't see her but I do have Midna in the room I might bring her on camera against her will later
1342100	1344843	God, what else do we say about this journey?
1344863	1350531	So we merged with All Games Radio, and then we were doing our thing for several years.
1350651	1356378	E3 changed, and we didn't do E3 again until 2010, and I don't think we all went.
1356518	1357379	I think I went.
1358440	1360904	No, I went too.
1361084	1361945	Did you go that year too?
1362305	1363587	I'm trying to remember.
1363607	1365289	It gets fuzzy at that point.
1365590	1381573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1381553	1383719	Yeah, of course we did Disneyland.
1383799	1385985	Yeah, so it's all a blur.
1386908	1390899	But around that time, 2012 is when we started VOG Network.
1391000	1395753	We did leave all games, and I don't want to get into negativity because it wasn't negative.
1395833	1396896	It was just...
1396876	1399519	It was going this direction, and we wanted to go this direction.
1399539	1400200	And we said, you know what?
1400220	1405065	It's probably best we kind of fill out these things and do our visions in the way we want to do them.
1405565	1409510	And so Bobby and I started VOG Network, and that's where we started.
1409750	1420601	We also had pulled in several of our friends we met through the podcasting realm, like PodCulture was there at the beginning, Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wow was with us for a while, Horde House.
1420742	1426748	There's a lot of shows there at the beginning, and we've been with the Voice Geeks Network ever since on this really great journey.
1426728	1432103	So yeah, that was like 23 and a half years of history all kind of compressed down.
1432545	1436676	But it's wild to think just really how long it's been.
1437037	1440708	And it's been every Sunday for those, you know, 23 years.
1440728	1441851	And...
1441831	1444674	Just grateful to those of you that show up here and make it worth it.
1444755	1447378	Whether you're here live or on the podcast feed.
1447398	1450381	Because there's an awful lot of you here live tonight and I really appreciate it.
1450982	1451803	But also on the podcast feed.
1451823	1453345	I know many of you listen on the podcast feed.
1453605	1454767	Some of you in Discord.
1455207	1457550	And somebody in chat had said y'all should join the Discord.
1458631	1461775	Sorry, it's scrolling by faster than I. I'm not sure who said what.
1461795	1464138	But somebody said you should join the Discord server.
1464438	1465340	And yes, I agree.
1465440	1467162	VOGnetwork.com.
1467462	1471467	Because again, even though this show is ending...
1471447	1483144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1483968	1513249	I'm a little drunk right now, so probably more beer.
1514073	1514754	No driving.
1516436	1517637	I'm at my house, Rob.
1517657	1518539	Where am I going to go?
1518659	1521462	I'm going to go drive to the ballet studio.
1521482	1522844	Maybe you want taquitos.
1522864	1523605	I don't fucking know.
1524326	1525387	We got DoorDash now.
1526028	1527169	That's what Dan's for.
1527550	1534138	I have a bunch of peanut M&M's that I'm sure Dan's going to steal a bag from me because those are his favorite.
1537723	1542949	I can't talk about one of them because you're all going to find out.
1543469	1545810	Oh yes, you'll find out.
1546375	1548433	You must stay for the end, but you will find out.
1549207	1553772	Other than that, I am going to still be streaming.
1554132	1557136	I'm going to put a lot more effort into my channel.
1558717	1564644	In fact, I'm hoping to petition friends to help me to build.
1564884	1571031	I didn't think I would really enjoy streaming as much as I do.
1571351	1575196	I kind of got scared off Twitch for a little while.
1575236	1577458	I've been on there since 2017.
1577438	1594323	But coming back and finding how much I love Dead by Daylight and having a place that I can play Hot to Full Boyfriend, Holiday Star once a year, and all of the people I've met, I've had a lot of support and I appreciate the continued support.
1594864	1597708	And honestly, it really...
1598667	1627408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1629059	1635168	And then me passing out in the car on the way back and getting a stripe across my chest from the seatbelt.
1636950	1637831	Thank you, Matt, for that.
1639894	1640956	That was fun.
1640976	1643479	And that is honestly the last time I've been to Pensacola.
1645822	1650409	And then I remember going for another trip and going to a DDR tournament.
1652932	1653653	Was it in Metairie?
1653713	1654915	I think it was in Metairie.
1655249	1657592	Yes, you bought me a penis cookie.
1657632	1660176	It was the macaroon, and I ate all of that.
1660857	1663100	That macaroon, it was actually really delicious.
1663141	1664282	Remember the podcast.
1664863	1666165	Jamie's been drinking a little bit.
1666245	1668608	Remember, we got the podcast listeners.
1669149	1670892	Hey, I can do what I want.
1671032	1671873	I do what I want.
1672134	1673736	She's responding to a lot of comments in chat.
1673756	1675358	We have a very crowded chat room tonight.
1675378	1675659	Thank you.
1675679	1677882	Thank you for being here.
1677862	1679324	You know, one more person and it'll be 69.
1679364	1679564	Nice.
1681207	1681507	Anyway.
1682488	1683790	But yeah.
1684151	1685332	So that's going to be my thing.
1685352	1693985	I'm doing a sub-a-thon on next Sunday to fill the blazing, aching gap in my soul.
1695467	1695867	Rob!
1696929	1697349	Loki!
1698090	1698531	Midna!
1700113	1703398	But yeah, I'm going to be doing a sub-a-thon next week.
1703818	1707143	I'm going to be doing Dead by Daylight, trying to get Pig to P100.
1707899	1709622	Because I am a filthy, dirty pig main.
1711785	1716792	And apart from that, I'm still doing graphic work.
1716912	1718755	Things are going well for me at my job.
1719656	1721519	And yeah.
1722220	1725284	And of course, there's the new thing.
1725304	1727988	Or is it new?
1728008	1728509	Or is it?
1729611	1730232	What is butter?
1731033	1731814	Think about it.
1733347	1745890	Honk if you exist Oh, I'm sorry, I'm channeling Omega Mart Jamie, just remember as you drink, this is the episode that will be it for some people You know what?
1747412	1753864	I have a rule for everybody right now Why aren't y'all drinking?
1754325	1756148	Because I have to work tomorrow
1756583	1758206	Girl, I took tomorrow off.
1758266	1760310	I have to play.
1760370	1761111	I'm not drunk.
1761652	1763295	I'm buzzed.
1763315	1763977	Anyway, all right.
1765058	1765459	Let's see.
1766080	1769306	I'm almost done with this Guinness, and we've been live for 30 minutes.
1770669	1771370	Go into our chat room.
1771390	1772512	This is my last Guinness, too.
1772993	1774916	There was a comment that was made.
1775017	1775217	Let's see.
1776209	1805305	There was a comment from ImmortalKing who said,
1805285	1807807	Can't you do a poll in Twitch?
1807827	1809289	We can totally do a poll in Twitch.
1809349	1810229	I already looked into that.
1810330	1812632	The maximum is five responses in Twitch.
1812652	1819157	Girl, there are poll sites on the internet that you can use for free.
1820339	1820739	It's fine.
1820759	1828346	We will look back on the gaming headlines in different ways, but we didn't want to do that.
1828406	1835292	And plus, usually we would have a fourth chair for a list list, and tonight it's just the three of us for now.
1835272	1840057	That's okay.
1840377	1841578	SurveyMonkey!
1842139	1845663	We'll do a look back on 23 and a half years of gaming news in just a little bit.
1846063	1847885	Maybe, I have an idea, Rob.
1848065	1848646	What?
1848666	1855012	In a little bit, why don't we each put up a memory and have our listeners vote on it?
1855032	1855493	There you go.
1855693	1856754	Yes, we can do that.
1856814	1857995	Oh, I got someone knocking on my door.
1858015	1858456	One sec.
1858856	1859657	Okay, uh-oh.
1860157	1861359	Tell them to bring me a pizza!
1861759	1861819	No!
1862440	1863021	or Waffles.
1863081	1867585	So, Jamie, is there anything else you want to share for your future and what that looks like?
1869026	1876513	My future probably has me opening up that bottle of wine because I'm not going to get through the night sober.
1878015	1884280	I am too emotionally over... If you see my camera turn off, it's because my ass went for another beer, okay?
1885301	1889565	My ass went for another... And the rest of me went with my ass to get that beer.
1890927	1891367	And...
1892410	1897619	We're tempted to actually make a cocktail.
1897639	1900223	I'm gonna make a cocktail.
1900423	1901185	What happened, Loki?
1901405	1902026	And you know what?
1902547	1905131	I also got a delivery.
1905151	1905652	What'd you get?
1906493	1909939	I got the flowers in peanut butter M&M's.
1910600	1910941	Yum.
1911422	1912343	Peanut butter?
1912123	1912343	!
1913960	1916142	Well, these are going to go to the kids.
1917303	1917824	The flowers?
1917864	1919525	That's what I see to give the flowers to the kids.
1919545	1924630	No, dude, I will trade you one of these peanut ones for your peanut butter ones.
1925111	1926072	I really appreciate it.
1926252	1928814	I hate peanut butter chocolate together.
1928834	1929515	No offense.
1929715	1931617	It's just, it's not, I don't like that.
1931637	1933059	No, Loki, Loki, Loki.
1933259	1936582	Do you want my bag of diabetes candy?
1936642	1937263	No, I'm good.
1937643	1941807	Loki, save one of those bags for me and I will give you the peanut ones.
1942512	1947291	it's all good no I want the peanut butter ones I volunteer as tribute
1948807	1950469	No, no, it's all good.
1951070	1952311	They will be eaten.
1952331	1953633	We have so much candy.
1953813	1956276	We have Halloween candy that lasts a whole year, so it's all good.
1956756	1957857	Savalas, don't be sorry.
1957877	1959679	You're trying to do a good thing.
1959780	1960300	No, no, no, no.
1960320	1960821	Seriously, I'm sorry.
1960841	1962022	The kids were going to get it anyway.
1962403	1963384	The kids were going to get it anyway.
1963404	1964485	I'm a bad recipient.
1964505	1968570	I should never have seen anything like this.
1968590	1969190	It's all good.
1969210	1970492	I really appreciate it.
1970572	1971573	You didn't have to do that.
1971793	1975417	It's very well appreciated, so no, don't feel bad.
1975477	1975978	It's...
1976347	1983694	Just because I don't eat those, and I don't eat a lot of candy nowadays anyways, but the family will go through it.
1985156	1986717	It'll be gone.
1986737	1989600	Do you see what's on camera right now, everyone who's watching in chat?
1990441	1992663	This is called a fucking crime.
1994224	1996407	A fucking crime against me.
1997147	2001932	Alright, Loki, what's next for you?
2002722	2005146	No, I'm going to get more into streaming.
2005487	2009214	So I'm going to keep myself busy with a lot of the Minecraft stuff.
2009234	2010617	I'm already... Oh, gosh.
2010677	2013382	I've already lined up another SMP to join.
2013442	2014303	Oh, wow.
2014323	2015986	To be doing Create Mods stuff with.
2016708	2020034	And then... But I don't know if that's going to be streaming necessarily.
2020375	2021517	That might be just something else.
2022038	2023380	And then...
2024018	2028622	I have my other create mod series I was actually working on starting.
2028642	2032366	So that should be hopefully ready to go next week.
2032526	2044917	The one on the SMP that I'm doing, I'm going to be building in, it's not going to be exact because I don't want to build a huge massive project, but it's going to be Bioshock Infinite themed.
2044957	2051423	So I spent many hours today putting together my Booker DeWitt skin for my character.
2051523	2054025	So I've got that.
2054005	2061002	Yeah, Starter Base in the Lighthouse and then, you know, Flying City as the mega base, if you will, for that.
2061644	2066055	And Create Mods is fun because there's a lot of like cog wheels and like motion and stuff.
2066095	2071508	So be able to get like a really cool level of detail with that, which I'm hoping to be able to do.
2071488	2089598	and then yeah it'll be fun just to mess around with that and I've got my other stuff that I'm going to try to get to you know with Child 64 getting you know my projects done with that next season it should be even more fun I already have an idea of what I'm going to do for that
2089578	2112514	and yeah it's just gonna be just kind of uh focusing more on streaming in fact actually this week too i'm gonna try to stream a few times because i'm actually off for the week um we'll see how that works out though i if i find when i take time off suddenly i have all these chores i gotta do funny how that works um it's already like that this week but i've got uh
2112663	2118831	I'm not doing the live stream, but I'm appearing on someone's live stream on Tuesday at 11 Pacific.
2118951	2121775	It's this thing called Walking with Dippy.
2121795	2124579	It's one of our friend's Dippy brothers.
2124619	2130607	She's in the UK and she invites people on and you just play Minecraft and chat for a few hours.
2130867	2131849	So I'll be doing that.
2132850	2136295	I don't have any events scheduled anytime soon, but you never know.
2137016	2137236	But
2138330	2147124	Yeah, I'm going to be very busy and try to get into regular streaming and really build up my channels that way too.
2147164	2153374	Because right now with just the SMP content, YouTube is not really doing... It's flat if not negative.
2154435	2155978	It is flattening out, which is good.
2155998	2160625	Because I'm hoping that that means that whatever bot accounts are on there...
2160605	2185870	you're getting rid of those and getting accounts to actually engage with the content but the create mod stuff should help with that a lot of people like modded series and it'll be fun to kind of put it's going to be a few different spins on that stuff so I'm hoping to stay busy with that alright what's next for me well what's interesting is that I have already taped the first episode of my next podcast
2186862	2191727	But unless you and I work at the same place, you will never hear it.
2192247	2197833	So I got roped into leading a podcast project at my day job, which is great.
2198073	2203379	And obviously, I have a lot of stuff that I can lend to that.
2204279	2207022	But yeah, it's meant for my day job stuff.
2207082	2210546	And I don't like to cross the streams a lot for my day job and what I do at night.
2210666	2214810	So unless y'all want to pay me a salary...
2215853	2219417	No, but that's, so that's something I'm working on with my day job.
2220158	2224604	And looking in chat, JD says, did they know you had experience?
2225024	2226426	The answer is yes.
2226526	2229230	My current boss is actually a listener of this show.
2229250	2230992	So a big hello to Carol.
2231252	2232994	I'm sure you're out there listening.
2233435	2234056	Thank you for that.
2234096	2235898	Thank you for that support and all that.
2236118	2239463	Rob is a very good worker and you should give him 50 raises.
2241165	2241365	All right.
2241385	2242266	Anyway.
2242685	2244307	Let's not say too much about work.
2244327	2251093	But anyway, so that's – and obviously that's a very – realistically, none of you would want to hear it anyway.
2251113	2252655	It's not about video games.
2252675	2253396	It's about work.
2253656	2254377	It's very different.
2254917	2256579	We have podcasts at my job too.
2256919	2257039	Yeah.
2257059	2258541	It's like this leadership thing.
2258981	2265167	It's a nice evolution of the type of work that I do to have those types of discussions.
2265187	2267730	So that will be –
2267710	2268751	That'll be good to get into.
2268891	2270973	Anyway, that's all I really want to say about that.
2271253	2278019	But otherwise, in all honesty, outside of my day jobs, my next project is rest.
2278039	2287568	I am going to stick to not doing anything for the rest of this year, which there isn't a whole lot, but it's still a good six weeks where I'm not going to do anything in this space.
2287628	2294534	I'm not going to stream personally, so sorry if you were looking for those types of personal streams, but I need to prioritize rest right now.
2294634	2297717	I think I can recognize that, and so that's exactly what I plan on doing.
2297697	2303786	In 2026, I'll probably continue to do personal streams here and there.
2304086	2308914	I look forward to continuing with the Voice Geeks Network as an individual contributor.
2308934	2311057	That doesn't mean that I'm doing the Rob Roberts show.
2311077	2311818	That's not what that means.
2312078	2319950	That means I'm going to be looking to, you know, what are some other ways we can get the network's name out there?
2320210	2323435	You know, meaning like, we don't really do anything on TikTok right now.
2323415	2325157	How can we push that presence forward?
2325218	2326319	We don't do a lot.
2326339	2331186	And when I say TikTok, I mean Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, all those sorts of things.
2331927	2339658	How can we sort of leverage that and continue to potentially have content on demand on YouTube or whatever it is?
2339798	2341841	I'll be working on some of those types of things.
2341901	2343183	That's what the future looks like for me.
2343524	2346147	And it's something that can be a little more flexible on my schedule.
2346167	2351515	So it'll allow me to hopefully with weekends back, I'm looking to maybe try to do some more conventions,
2351495	2354139	I've really loved doing panel hosting and moderating.
2354660	2357524	I am looking forward to returning to DragonCon 2026.
2357724	2365576	I don't know what capacity until I have my schedule, but looking forward to participating with that and having fun.
2366717	2370203	And hopefully work with some more conventions in the future.
2370223	2372546	Also, I still do live hosting.
2372566	2380017	So even though I say I am resting, there is one show I am obligated to host and I am looking forward to it in December.
2379997	2394150	So if you happen to be in the Sacramento area, you can check out Nevermore Gorlesque or Love Horror Events on Instagram or Facebook or they're not on Twitter.
2394751	2398039	So I'm trying to remember if there's another place, but you check that out.
2398019	2425309	and that will have the upcoming shows including December 13th we're hosting the Krampus Cabaret and it's going to be a fun little cabaret burlesque comedy variety music show headlined by Dolly the winner of season four of the Boulay Brothers Dragula so that will be here thank you Midna that will be here in Saturday December 13th here locally and then I'm going to be hosting my first brunch
2425289	2426631	in January.
2426651	2429374	So more info on that is coming shortly.
2429394	2438344	So again, that's all local to the Sacramento area, though I am hoping there is a very good chance I will be doing something in the Bay Area in May next year.
2438364	2440367	I know it's a way out, but there's a very good chance.
2440407	2448276	So I'm looking for events and things to hopefully grow, and that's really where a lot of my heart is right now and what I really want to push on while I'm still
2448256	2450403	of an age where I can do it all.
2451326	2456022	So I'll be really pushing forward in that event space in the coming...
2456812	2480777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2480757	2481800	in the next few weeks.
2482902	2485108	Rob's going to do a blog like he's a 90s mom.
2485188	2492286	No, it's not going to be a blog, but it's to put my name out there for live event hosting and try to book some more conventions and things of that sort.
2493289	2494512	That's what I'm hoping for.
2495695	2497078	That's what's next for me.
2499421	2500843	And hello again to everybody in chat.
2500863	2502344	You guys are chatting so much tonight.
2502364	2503666	Oh, Angel joined us.
2504127	2504587	I miss you.
2505208	2507070	I miss everybody that used to come in person.
2507110	2508732	We had such a vibe when we were in person.
2509052	2516301	And I realized that, you know, COVID changed things and then that leads to the personal life obligations change.
2516321	2520286	So it just never got together or never was in the cards for us to be back in person again.
2520686	2521547	But...
2521527	2527398	There were so many people that came in and out of the place, especially when it was like Loki and I living together.
2527418	2530924	And it was like our lives were centered around this show practically.
2531325	2533249	And so many people would show up on Sunday nights.
2533409	2535212	It was a lot of fun.
2535232	2536134	It was really good.
2536154	2540041	So Sterlok says, I would have loved to show up in person one day.
2540081	2541103	Well, we would have loved to have you.
2541684	2544970	But that doesn't mean that there isn't a new project coming.
2544950	2546773	Yeah.
2546813	2568814	Yeah.
2568895	2574664	I also thought we could take an opportunity tonight to look back on 23 years of gaming news.
2574684	2576447	23 and a half, really.
2576467	2576868	Oh, fuck.
2577849	2583358	So SSJ100Matt did a really good job of... Oh, actually, I pulled this up.
2583378	2586023	Sorry, tangent, but I promise this will happen a lot tonight.
2586383	2587825	So a quick tangent here.
2589027	2592753	We actually got these pictures from Bobby Blackwolf.
2592773	2593755	You ready for this?
2594258	2594819	Oh, Lord.
2594879	2596822	This is E3 2006.
2597463	2600408	So that's that stage.
2600428	2602652	And that's Loki right there.
2602732	2604675	That's Bobby Blackwolf on the end.
2604695	2606338	And these are two other podcasters.
2606438	2612588	I want to say, is that Evan who worked with Electric Sisterhood for a minute was kind of affiliated with them?
2612568	2613590	I don't know.
2613610	2614914	I think it is.
2614934	2616397	Or I just don't recognize this person.
2616798	2621229	And that's Elan from that show Chatterbox Radio, which they faded a few years ago.
2621269	2622692	But that was E3 2006.
2623133	2625619	And then I have another picture too.
2625840	2629168	I have the one of Jamie at the table too.
2629228	2631032	Why am I blurry?
2631907	2632808	I don't know.
2632888	2636213	This one's really big when I zoom in, so I'm going to have to show it this way.
2636233	2639177	So this is Bobby, DarkSakura.
2639377	2641039	I literally don't remember who this person is.
2641059	2642281	I'm so sorry.
2642301	2643282	And also Alon.
2643382	2645285	Isn't that Alon's little scooter he rode?
2645345	2646507	I remember that being a thing, too.
2647148	2648109	But look at that stage.
2648429	2651033	It's on the air, had that little logo.
2651053	2653476	So anyway, that was...
2653456	2654838	A lot of fun.
2654858	2656339	Yeah, sorry to this man.
2656359	2657581	Sorry to that man.
2657741	2658882	I don't remember who you are.
2658902	2659603	I'm sorry.
2660284	2663988	I've met a lot of people over the years and I have a very hard time remembering people's names.
2664008	2667112	Please don't take it as personal or any of that.
2668213	2673519	You remember when we went to John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza and we met another friend?
2674180	2675361	Yeah, there was a listener there.
2675542	2676222	I did, yeah.
2676242	2676943	There was a listener there.
2677824	2680307	Do you know I ran into that same individual years later?
2680827	2681267	Really?
2681368	2683129	Years later, we had like a mutual friend.
2683770	2686673	And still into Mamadi and music games all these years later.
2686773	2688095	Yeah, I ran into that individual.
2688595	2695062	And then there was the time you guys were waiting in line for the Nintendo Wii at Target.
2695082	2697205	And somebody was like listening to us on their iPod.
2697225	2699087	That was me and Chris.
2699127	2699707	You and Chris, yeah.
2701189	2701810	Oh my God.
2703992	2704192	Yeah.
2704693	2705153	Memories.
2705173	2708657	And we bribed our place in line with coffee and donuts.
2708677	2709518	It worked though.
2709970	2711051	It worked!
2711072	2711893	Still got my Wii.
2712934	2715918	I had my roommate stay in line for me, and it worked great.
2716078	2718121	Extifer stayed and got that.
2718261	2723589	I think that was the last launch I had been in line for, because before that was the Dreamcast.
2723609	2723829	Yeah.
2724770	2725852	On 9-9-99.
2726092	2728876	Hi, I'm in line for a Dreamcast, even though I already own one.
2730298	2731139	Where was I going?
2731680	2733803	Oh yeah, biggest gaming story is the 23 and a half years.
2733823	2734864	So, SSG...
2735519	2737841	Jamie, Jamie, it's the final show.
2737861	2738762	I've been drinking!
2738782	2740264	Is that how you want to be remembered?
2740725	2742086	Is that how you want to be remembered?
2743708	2745269	Well, I mean, there's worse.
2746691	2749354	I could shart on the thing, I don't know.
2749374	2750715	Keep drinking and you just might.
2751416	2753698	Hey, you gotta pace it yourself in this show, okay?
2753718	2755020	And we're gonna see that towards the end.
2755340	2755680	Alright.
2756261	2757062	Okay, okay.
2757242	2760365	Remember, I had the surgery.
2760385	2763889	I drink, I get drunk really fast, and then I sober really fast.
2764645	2794163	There you go.
2795813	2798257	Loki, you're the you're the Grand Theft Auto fan.
2798277	2799199	You remember Vice City?
2801543	2805691	Yeah, I think I don't remember if I took time off to play that one.
2805711	2809999	I know I did for three, but I don't remember if I did that for Vice City as well.
2810600	2811862	I don't remember Vice City that much.
2813164	2814146	2003.
2814727	2820117	Did you know it was 2003 after the show started when the Nintendo Game Boy Advance was released?
2821025	2825250	And it's also when Steam released and was a thing.
2825270	2825751	I remember.
2826592	2827673	I remember the orange box.
2827913	2828594	I remember that.
2828614	2829976	I definitely remember the orange box.
2830577	2831277	Portal 2.
2831317	2832399	That was years later, but yes.
2832979	2840609	Yeah, Portal, or is it Portal 1 had Steam support on the PlayStation 3, which is like a big deal.
2840849	2841329	Oh, yeah.
2841390	2842130	That was years later.
2842170	2842611	Is it?
2842591	2847057	Yeah, that was years later because the PlayStation 3 doesn't exist yet, so that's right.
2847077	2849540	And then I remember the Game Boy Advance.
2849621	2854427	I remember how it wasn't backlit, but a friend of mine at the time backlit it for my birthday, and that was a great thing.
2854467	2855989	The Game Boy Advance had some really good games.
2856009	2857511	Remember I had that pink one?
2857611	2862218	Me, who hates the color pink, got a pink one on purpose and had an afterburner in it?
2862358	2863259	Rules are made to be broken.
2864060	2865342	I still have it, too.
2866300	2872370	In 2004, the Nintendo Revolution was teased.
2872550	2875334	Remember when the Project Revolution became the Wii?
2876376	2876736	So much potential.
2876756	2879881	And everybody was like, why did you change the fucking name?
2880022	2883247	Anyway, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was released in 2004.
2884369	2885951	That took time off work, I remember that.
2886251	2889777	Half-Life 2 was released in 2004.
2890178	2906601	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2906716	2909721	with Nintendo, which was a huge moment as well.
2909801	2911504	A great face for a gaming company.
2911925	2917053	I will never forget when he leaned into the meme and did, my body is ready at one of those E3s.
2917093	2918656	Remember, I think that was E3 2006.
2918876	2919377	I feel like.
2919838	2920459	I think it was.
2920519	2922582	I think it was.
2922848	2947270	World of Warcraft
2947250	2950137	I became an MMO addict.
2950338	2952643	Oh, Bobby Blackwell says it was on this day.
2952763	2955069	It was November 23rd, 2004.
2955791	2960382	I still think that Slykick and I should have launched Hillsbrad Blues.
2960402	2962407	You should have.
2963062	2965166	Am I saying this correctly?
2965366	2971837	SP Azure in chat says, not going to lie, WoW is what moved me from casual into a gaming addict.
2972217	2982715	And a lot of love in chat for Horde House, which I'm sure Savalus or Grandpa Warcraft is wrapping himself into a blanket with all that kind look back there on Horde House.
2982735	2983416	Yeah, Horde House was a fun one.
2983396	2998560	It's a bummer WoW sort of flopped for a little while and sort of caused us to sort of fall, I don't want to say out of love with it because I'll always have a place in my heart for WoW, but it's just a bummer that everybody kind of went their own direction.
2998580	3003729	That project ended too, but that's because everybody just kind of went their own directions because we weren't all playing WoW anymore.
3003829	3008897	And we tried to do it, but it didn't hit the same when it wasn't...
3009383	3012527	Seekers in chat saying, let Horde House stay dead forever.
3012647	3013067	Yay.
3014930	3016612	So it just wasn't bringing the same joy.
3016952	3019876	But I am playing Final Fantasy XIV to this day.
3019896	3027465	If we were looking at my gaming week, I would say I played Final Fantasy XIV for the first time in months this week because I wanted to grind the tomes.
3027485	3030208	And that's still about, yeah.
3030228	3036596	Captain Spike says, I'd still listen to Horde House about Final Fantasy.
3036616	3038158	That was considered at one point.
3039252	3043199	I like Slaggy's suggestion.
3043219	3043940	Mog House.
3044161	3045302	Mog House.
3045323	3049309	Well, as I said, we're not committing to any new projects right now.
3050071	3052495	But look, there's the idea.
3052575	3053657	I'm going to put it on the table.
3054038	3060028	If Grandpa and Shane and, I don't know, Spike and Slaggy all want to do a Mog House...
3060768	3062370	Good blessings to you.
3062430	3063131	Good luck.
3063732	3065113	Yeah, that's it.
3066435	3069018	But I'm not committing to any new projects at this time.
3070139	3076667	One of the best compliments I think we possibly get from doing this show is your show has inspired me to do my own show.
3077047	3081012	And we've been fortunate enough to hear that several times from some of you out there.
3081553	3084316	And so it's very thankful for that.
3084516	3087720	Ragnarok Online Podcast win.

3098068	3101552	I still have that picture of your little guy with a flower in his hair somewhere.
3101712	3102994	I love that character.
3103014	3104235	Anyway, where were we?
3104255	3104536	That was 2004.
3104556	3105076	2005.
3105096	3108801	The Xbox 360 is announced and released.
3108861	3109221	That's right.
3109282	3110843	We're at the 20th anniversary of Xbox 360.
3110863	3112245	A lot of people are talking about that this week.
3113106	3116290	Xbox Live really takes off when the 360 takes off.
3117181	3137417	Hot Coffee Hot Coffee Hot Coffee Hot Coffee
3138578	3140841	And that's not just going at your cat.
3142062	3149130	No, but remember, so what SHO and Hunter Matt forgot to list there, OLRPSP.com.
3149150	3149831	That was huge.
3149871	3154215	I've said this a lot as we've been sunsetting over the last few weeks.
3154235	3157419	So many people found this show because of OLRPSP.com.
3157439	3162104	That was single-handedly probably one of the best marketing things that ever happened to this show.
3162124	3163766	And that was all Loki.
3163886	3165368	It was 100% Loki that did that.
3165748	3167370	So good job.
3168245	3197526	Thank you.
3198383	3204571	I was impressed with the stylistic choice, even though it's, you know, dated.
3204792	3210440	It's very much so a time capsule of design of its time, and I remembered just being so happy with it.
3211020	3214585	Oh, and DarkTetsuya says, bit.ly slash olrpsp.
3214765	3217429	I forgot that you made the shortener for that.
3217449	3220273	So you can use bit.ly olrpsp.
3220372	3222054	There's that.
3222174	3222534	Let's see.
3222614	3227179	But if Bit.ly tries to put a virus on your PSP, we don't endorse that.
3227219	3228640	Guitar Hero came out in 2005.
3228660	3234666	And that, of course, was when they came to DarkSakura's house to film DarkSakura and Loki for the news.
3235486	3238489	I was teaching a class at work that day and could not go.
3238509	3239911	I could not get out of it.
3239931	3242794	So you guys were on the news showcasing that.
3243534	3245476	And was that the It's So Much Fun?
3245796	3246998	No, that was the podcast story.
3247018	3248539	No, that was the podcast story.
3248519	3249480	That was the podcast story.
3249981	3252944	You'd think that would be about Guitar Hero, but it wasn't.
3253165	3255748	Wasn't that the whole, I'd give it an 8 out of 10?
3256709	3262957	They made me hide my Guitar Freaks guitars, but this keyboard was still in the background.
3263498	3269926	Yes, I gave it a solid 8 or 9 out of 10, and DarkSakura was like, I'll give it an 11 out of 10.
3269946	3273290	I'm like, that's not within the metrics of what they put me on the news.
3273330	3274171	I'll give it an 11.
3275432	3276754	But this one goes to 11.
3279046	3307264	but that was fun let's see what else do we have 2006 that was the year that the PS3 released and the Wii released those were huge stories right there right we covered we covered those launches we went out to the lines we interviewed people that was a lot of fun that was I feel like there hasn't the Nintendo Switch 2 launched recently and that's the closest we've come to that but it doesn't compare it doesn't compare it's not the same as when the Wii released
3308155	3310078	Did both systems come out the same day?
3310799	3311681	No, they didn't.
3311901	3312983	They were slightly apart.
3314325	3315627	I want to say we were out there both nights.
3316889	3330491	They were slightly apart because I remember I had already purchased the Wii and I wasn't going to get a PlayStation 3, but then one of my accounts, they're like, hey, we're just going to give you one.
3331051	3331632	I'm like, cool.
3333255	3335158	I want my Switch at work.
3335392	3342800	In 2007, Rock Band released and music games took over sports games in terms of popularity.
3342820	3350329	And Justin.TV started in 2007, which of course was the website that became where we're broadcasting now, Twitch Television.
3351170	3353593	The iPhone was released in 2007.
3354253	3360100	That is hard for me to wrap my head around because I have to-
3360535	3363680	and Dan was playing with it and he's like, okay, we're going to go get one.
3364000	3369389	Well, I just think, I'm like, what phone was I using when this show started?
3369409	3372053	But it was that shitty little flip phone I had.
3372073	3373475	I can tell you exactly what I was using.
3373495	3374497	Dan was using a Razer.
3374517	3375699	I had a Sony Ericsson.
3376119	3376620	Wow.
3377630	3380416	It's just, it's weird to me that, yeah.
3380456	3383823	S2100Matt says, iPhone is on my list list of most important stories.
3383843	3384404	I get it.
3384584	3386368	And Will Wheaton signed mine.
3386668	3389414	It wore off by the end of the day, but he signed it and did one of one.
3390977	3396328	My other big story would be related to this, but it's not this, but it's closely related.
3396949	3397891	We haven't gotten there yet though.
3397911	3399334	We got to go about 10 more years.
3399314	3405384	2008, The Red Ring of Death Controversy, and finally Microsoft acknowledges it.
3405464	3413598	It's weird to me that that never resulted in a class action thing, to be honest.
3413618	3415562	So that's, yeah, it's wild.
3417064	3417525	Um...
3418349	3423195	Actually, it probably did become clap, but those things never actually go to report.
3423215	3424878	Yeah, they did the repair program out of that.
3424898	3425619	Yeah, yeah, you're right.
3426520	3428202	PlayStation Home launched.
3428322	3429063	Oh, my God.
3429404	3434651	Do you remember the listener that was obsessed with PlayStation Home and was such an advocate for it?
3434991	3437875	And he built out this elaborate space in PlayStation Home.
3437895	3439197	It was legit impressive.
3439217	3440338	This isn't me being shady.
3440358	3442461	I was legit impressed with that.
3443042	3443142	Yeah.
3443122	3445369	There was so much more potential in PlayStation Home.
3445389	3447235	God damn it, I wish Sony had stuck with it.
3447255	3448880	There still is potential in PlayStation Home.
3448900	3449422	I agree.
3450886	3453013	I totally agree.
3453702	3458188	Jason says, fun fact, Rob and I used the same phone when we met in person in 2004.
3458889	3460311	Qualcomm something something.
3460331	3467502	Yeah, it was a little silver flip phone, and it played the more complex cell phone games that were big in Japan at the time.
3467842	3469064	Like the Castlevania game.
3469184	3472909	A lot of games you can't play anymore that were on that cell platform.
3473410	3475653	Old Game Boy fucking games.
3475733	3476875	Although...
3476855	3480520	There are some of the preservation people have put those in playable formats now.
3480680	3482243	Yeah, I remember a story on that a few.
3482263	3484446	Yeah, not that long ago.
3485748	3487490	Thank God for the preservationists.
3487510	3489733	2009, Little Big Planet.
3490034	3493538	One of the best series of all times.
3493558	3494119	I miss that.
3494159	3495822	I really wish that series would come back.
3496563	3497684	Batman Arkham Asylum.
3498846	3500348	Minecraft was released.
3500902	3501703	There you go.
3501804	3503246	And Loki's future was made.
3503707	3506191	League of Legends was released.
3506211	3506692	Oh my God.
3506712	3508595	A lot of big games in 2009.
3508916	3510098	Like Arkham Asylum was huge.
3510118	3514506	I didn't mean to gloss over that, but I just thought it was huge and led to one of the all-time greatest trilogies.
3514526	3515367	Wow.
3515819	3519668	2010, the 3DS was revealed.
3519688	3525582	The original Final Fantasy XIV started, which, yeah, I played the original Final Fantasy XIV.
3525602	3526545	It was wild.
3527487	3530715	2011, the Wii U revealed.
3530795	3532579	The 3DS released.
3532559	3546448	I must have been at E3 that year because I remember going to E3 the year that the models had the strap around their belt and they had the 3DSs and they would actually come to you in line so you could see like a little demo.
3546468	3551117	And it was a legit like a champagne bottle cork pop thing or like little effects.
3551237	3552881	It was just little tech demos.
3552901	3553943	But like...
3553923	3559832	Do you all remember, those of you that are old enough, do you all remember the first time you saw the 3DS?
3559852	3563999	Because it was legitimately 3D without glasses.
3564019	3570249	And it was one of those things where it's like, I don't believe that that's possible or it's going to look like shit.
3570269	3575577	And then you see one for the first time and it's like, oh, oh shit.
3576670	3577693	This actually works.
3577793	3584229	It's so weird that it never took off, though, because they literally just said, oh, well, we're not going to use it.
3584249	3587958	Dan had a phone at the time, by the way, that had lenticular 3D.
3588359	3589161	Oh, boy.
3589985	3614676	yeah yeah and I yeah I agree it would hurt your eyes after you played it for a long time and I Nintendo did kind of walk away from it I I wish they had leaned more into the media part of it they did a little bit remember when they were like we're gonna put Spongebob episodes on it but I distinctly remember it was a Game Boy Advance that they did that they did that hard in the Game Boy Advance because do you know what else came out in 2010 Tron Legacy
3614740	3623805	the the good Tron came out in 2010 and I swear hey the first one was good no it was it was too but you know what I'm shading um
3624241	3653100	but uh in 2010 uh am I am I making it up or was there a Tron Legacy trailer on one of those 3DSs in full 3D like I swear that was a thing they were showing like movie trailers and movie previews I don't remember Tron but I remember there was the Tekken animated movie that had it well that also came out fully 3D um on the 3DS as well as like a digital video or something but they had the trailer for that and
3653485	3655768	I don't remember if Tron ever had that.
3655808	3656889	I don't think they did.
3657270	3658852	I'm looking at the internet.
3659172	3662597	It might be one of those Mandala Effect things.
3663257	3668063	But maybe I saw it on another platform and thought it was a 3DS.
3668624	3669786	Maybe one of those cell phones.
3670567	3674191	I'm not getting anything out of the internet.
3675493	3676254	Let's see.
3676314	3678617	I'm just surprised they never released a 3D Netflix.
3679238	3681180	Especially with how big 3D Netflix was.
3682831	3684015	ZenMonkey says there was.
3684035	3685399	Thank you!
3685420	3686323	Somebody else remembers that.
3686343	3686965	Okay, I'm not crazy.
3687005	3687547	Okay.
3687567	3690256	Duke Nukem Forever finally comes out in 2011.
3690817	3693145	Twitch launches officially in 2011.
3693985	3723267	uh 2012 Mass Effect 3 ending controversy actually you know what if you don't buy into the hype the controversy is not so bad I that was right when I got into Mass Effect as well and I remember the series being I I played one two and three and got to see the original ending of three and that was maybe two months before the extended cut came out so I got to see it all eventually I didn't think it was that bad I understand the concerns people had with it and I am glad the continuity was shit
3723247	3731301	This is why when they do the Mass Effect TV series or whatever, they're not going to even attempt to do the same story.
3731661	3733264	They would never be able to get it right.
3734106	3740096	I am going to say that whether or not people complained about it, it needed to be amended because the continuity was bad.
3740256	3745806	I don't hate the extended cut by any means, but I think gamers took the original thing way too far.
3745826	3746186	That's all.
3746827	3747769	As they tend to do.
3749065	3753004	Um, the Jeff Gertzman, Kane, and Lynch controversy.
3753024	3754189	I barely remember this.
3754209	3755616	This was the whole...
3756203	3785198	Bobby Blackwolf Mode
3785701	3805836	that he had one of those people Bobby had one of those people on his podcast and actually invited that and said you can call it Bobby Blackwolf mode because I'm bad at video games or whatever it was and and that's where that came from because Bobby said you know I I like to use these type of assisted modes when I play video games so we can have a Bobby mode but I remember him
3805816	3807661	I remember there was a question Bobby asked.
3807681	3810147	I'll have to put it in chat because he probably remembered better than I can.
3810568	3813736	He asked them something about their take on a current controversy.
3814437	3820753	And his answer was basically something like, I'm glad you asked because nobody has yet.
3821172	3824737	And it was really obvious in that whole situation.
3824757	3826860	It was something like, why did you do this?
3827201	3830065	And he's like, I'm glad you asked because nobody has yet.
3830346	3833130	Yet there's been tons of stories and tons of think pieces on it.
3833991	3836415	But nobody had actually said, thank you.
3836455	3839078	Bobby Blackwell says, why did you call it girlfriend mode?
3839119	3840000	That was the question.
3840420	3842183	So Bobby asked them, why did you do that?
3842263	3846149	And nobody else had asked him that question yet.
3846169	3846910	Think about that.
3849455	3851258	Good job, investigative reporter, BlackWolf.
3852079	3853541	All right.
3853581	3854062	Let's see.
3854082	3857967	We also had the Oculus Rift was released.
3857987	3859249	Hmm.
3859269	3873249	I did not get big into VR early on, but obviously, you know, Bobby was, and it was probably one or two Dragon Cons late, because 2012 would have been around my first Dragon Con, too, because that was when VOG Network started, which you left off the list, Matt.
3873269	3874531	VOG Network starts 2012.
3874711	3875412	Yeah.
3875392	3902513	just kidding but that would have been my first Dragon Con as well would have been that same year and so I don't know if I don't think it was that year I saw the Rift for the first time because it was when Bobby and I did the suite years later so probably 2016 but yeah Bobby Bobby in chat says I carried the VR torch for all of us and that's accurate 2013 Grand Theft Auto 5 revealed PlayStation 4 revealed with a big E3 announcement the Ouya is released and fails it doesn't feel like it was that long ago
3903438	3906105	and the Xbox One reversal.
3906185	3906907	Oh, that was huge.
3907448	3909433	I am running through these fast so we can get to some other things.
3909734	3911999	2014, Facebook buys Oculus.
3912200	3913443	Amazon buys Twitch.
3913583	3918215	Again, that feels like that happened right before COVID, not over 10, 11 years ago.
3918736	3921042	Five Nights at Freddy's released.
3921022	3922844	That game is that old?
3922864	3924526	It feels like that game blew up overnight.
3924606	3925467	We're all that old.
3925567	3926088	Oh my god.
3926108	3929471	2015, Iwata passes away.
3930132	3930833	Ooh, that was rough.
3931073	3933116	That was, yeah, that was really sad.
3933196	3943247	I remember the show we did because that news came out on a Sunday and we pivoted our entire show that night to do a special opening in Tribute.
3943267	3944088	And that was really sad.
3944448	3946911	Everybody in the industry was hit hard by that one.
3947633	3949237	It still is, really.
3949317	3951202	Konami and Kojima divorce.
3951343	3953288	Konami and Kojima do their nasty divorce that year.
3953468	3954992	And Discord launches in 2015.
3955012	3958782	2016.
3959103	3960146	Okay, here it is.
3960166	3961369	My other big headline.
3961429	3962512	Biggest headline we've ever had.
3962793	3964377	Pokemon Go launches.
3965082	3971971	And before you all comment on your feelings about Pokemon Go, especially today, first, I realize there's a lot of people that still play it.
3972351	3978459	But I want you all to think about when I say that, I really want you to think about the summer of 2016.
3980682	3986429	And when you were like, I'm going to leave the house today and I'm going to go catch some Pokemon.
3986469	3989453	And I've been wanting to say that ever since I was a kid.
3991711	4014546	and that was the reality and I realized for a lot of people that weren't happy with the game's direction it started to really die off after that summer and then everything in the world started going topsy-turvy with Pokemon Go to the polls and all that stuff and what happened that November and there's a lot of people that sometimes joke Pokemon Go was that last hurrah before it all went to shit.
4016872	4022719	But I... I really did... Despite... Yeah, the closest to world peace, says JV Mon.
4022739	4023443	That's so true.
4024126	4024789	I...
4025512	4028795	That summer was so special for so many people.
4028815	4042567	And I just think people, like if you weren't playing Ingress or another AR game before that, which the reality was most people weren't, you didn't experience a game like that that made you go outdoors and walk around and find things.
4042727	4046431	It transformed a way that people game.
4047051	4053477	And I think what it ties into the phone thing, it made a really good case for here is a gaming experience.
4053457	4078468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4079630	4082294	Yeah, and Mike Deft in chat says, do I want to go back to that time?
4082334	4082855	Heck no.
4082955	4084418	Original Pokemon Go sucked.
4084438	4094875	Yeah, the game has come a long way and they've changed a lot over the years and so forth, but I think there was something very special about that summer and the way that it changed the way a lot of people thought about video games.
4094895	4101486	Now, I was ahead of the curve because I was playing Ingress at that time, so I already was leaving the house to capture portals, but...
4101466	4106312	I know the reality is most people had not been introduced to that concept.
4106372	4113441	And it really took Pokemon and marrying with that concept to really get a lot of people to do that.
4113501	4116946	Zaku says, my fiance still plays Pokemon Go and drives.
4116966	4118107	Hopefully not at the same time.
4118548	4121071	But yes, I still play Pokemon Go.
4121352	4126078	I play a lot with Bluetooth, but I will walk and I'll play Pokemon Go and do all that.
4126238	4127980	Uh-oh, are you on another drink, DarkSakura?
4128787	4135918	It is a mocha made with borjata and tuaca whipped.
4136940	4139644	The only milk I had was chocolate protein shake, but it's still going to be delightful.
4140445	4142949	And some hazelnut mocha coffee.
4144031	4146755	It will be chocolatey and alcoholy and delicious.
4146855	4151943	Plus the glass I won on another friend's stream.
4152083	4153325	Thank you, Pie Fanatic.
4153345	4154267	That's a lovely looking glass.
4155409	4156971	It does kind of look like good night cream, doesn't it?
4157103	4158845	And a couple more headlines in here.
4158905	4162408	2017, the Nintendo Switch OG released.
4162428	4167893	2018, Telltale Games shuts down and the Epic Game Store released.
4168113	4171476	Burr added to this with an extra item from 2006.
4172637	4176701	The Horse Armor DLC was released for Oblivion, which was the beginning of the end.
4176721	4176941	Yeah.
4177121	4185869	And then I'll also add from 2010, EA announces online pass for Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11.
4186249	4187110	Oh, yeah.
4187090	4197184	Remember when my Xbox got hacked for somebody trying to get EA FIFA passes or something?
4197464	4197805	Oh boy.
4198365	4204534	I told you, I think the two biggest stories there are probably World of Warcraft is probably my number one and then Pokemon Go is a close number two.
4205055	4207338	What do you all think was the biggest?
4207398	4208459	Is it on that list or something?
4208680	4213246	What do you all think was the biggest thing that happened in gaming in 23 years?
4213266	4215349	The biggest thing that influenced where we're at now?
4215729	4216270	Loki.
4218055	4244299	um gosh I don't know um try to think of like what the current landscape looks like I think certainly Fortnite adding loot boxes is like a major story I don't know when that happened but that's definitely during the time um and I mean sadly probably a lot of the yeah it's all Fortnite stuff um
4245494	4248147	Other than that, I would say...
4251704	4254187	I don't know, it's hard to imagine.
4254347	4256190	It's hard to pick one thing.
4256450	4257591	Yeah, I get it, I get it.
4259073	4267404	There's so many criteria, like what's most impactful in the gaming industry, like what I was most excited about, I don't know what was I most excited about.
4267424	4272210	Probably Grand Theft Auto 5 and 4, for sure, like when 4 came out.
4272811	4275073	All the Saints Row games, except for the last one.
4276195	4276395	Um...
4277928	4278289	I don't know.
4279210	4281493	Lots of great answers in chat here.
4281733	4286761	Redertainment says Fortnite, Burr11 adding to that, Fortnite switching from PvE to Battle Royale.
4287802	4290146	SheHulk10 says the Wii was obviously huge.
4290226	4292910	FifthDream says required online for everything.
4292930	4297756	I can't help but think about SimCity's original launch and what that did.
4297917	4298257	Let's see.
4298277	4300120	And Bobby Blackwolf, I love this insight too.
4300520	4305808	For me, it would be the proliferation of game engines available to the common person to expand the art form.
4305788	4308817	We didn't have Unity or Unreal Engine when OLR started.
4308837	4310663	Oh my god, pixel poops, right?
4310763	4313452	That's a big thing that happened in our history.
4313472	4317705	Not just the one that YYR made, but the one that Loki made, the sequel, which is now free on Steam.
4320132	4341704	and Bungie Ferritazine and Zaku that's a name I haven't seen in a long time, good to have you back Zaku says, Twitch launching the careers of content creators, that's right Twitch and YouTube and all that made a whole new industry in gaming, which is so wild DarkSakura, I gotta make sure we don't miss your pick what do you think is the biggest headline in the last 23 years?
4343366	4348654	fuck if I know it's all just the way that I see it it's
4350153	4352336	Everything has built on everything else.
4352456	4353678	It's all interconnected.
4353898	4367817	And for me, I think that it's hitting that point where I could look back on any news story that's ever come out and go, I've seen this shit.
4367837	4368578	Think about it.
4368598	4369379	No, I got it.
4369499	4369820	I got it.
4369840	4371282	Seeing the cycle.
4371302	4374005	I mean, and even today now people are like, oh, video games.
4374166	4376008	I'm like, shut up, Tipper Gore.
4377743	4385471	But I'm probably going to say that it's not really one thing.
4385491	4391498	I think it's just seeing, well, yeah, the Guinness Book of World Records, I guess that's a big thing, you know, us being in there.
4392038	4406434	But honestly, my whole thing is looking at this sort of from maybe a sociological point of view, an anthropological point of view, is the way our culture has evolved based on
4408405	4431983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4433836	4453093	we're the ones they come to because we know what's going on and that to me is bigger than just about any news that's ever come out is seeing the dynamic shift in gaming culture I'm also a big nerd I love that shit
4454879	4456301	Also, spreadsheets are cool.
4457061	4460265	Ooh, I have to agree with this comment from JD in chat.
4460285	4460746	This is huge.
4460766	4465991	I can't believe this is off a radar, but because it is such a negative, I'm going to bring up the biggest negative.
4466232	4468715	The biggest negative of the last 23 years.
4468735	4474181	Speaking of cultural impact, says JD, Gamergate was a big story of the past 23 years in negative ways.
4474501	4479086	You can draw a direct line to that and the politics of today.
4479106	4481149	And it's fucking disgusting.
4482170	4482490	Um...
4483583	4485966	And I don't know what else to say about it, to be quite honest.
4486126	4494397	I think... I hope a lot of us have been able to use that moment to sort of like grow the fuck up.
4494417	4502147	I think it made... I think it also made... In some ways, I'm trying to think of what possible positive spin I could put on this.
4503329	4503809	And it's hard.
4504771	4508916	And I think what I could say is that that whole negativity...
4510938	4518309	I think we can go and we can see... You know how we've been talking a lot lately about the people that like to say, don't mix politics and video games.
4518329	4521354	And we're saying like, dude, the tariffs are driving the prices of consoles.
4521714	4524458	Mixing politics and video games is already here.
4524478	4528144	I think a lot of people are now aware.
4528164	4534093	Video games and gaming culture and the gaming industry is not just a fucking...
4534765	4537529	basement dwelling nerd thing.
4537549	4541274	It's not an underground zine type of thing.
4542035	4551168	It is a very full-fleshed for better and for worse industry that has serious political implications.
4551188	4555294	As YYR succinctly put it in chat, politics affect everything.
4555314	4563726	And I think we all, now all of us that live through that and watch that play out when that happened, we all have an acute awareness of that shit now.
4563773	4588212	so there is that for what it's worth okay um let's move on let's talk about something positive and I want to reflect on any show memories I know there's so much we could probably talk about in 23 years but does anybody have does anybody have a particular moment of a show memory that was like one of the best you eating Loki's waffles that was like one of the first drunk episodes right
4588833	4597142	Oh, also me and Seeger coming up with the word dunk for drunk and just being completely obsessed with dunk.
4598283	4598523	I do.
4598623	4599444	I remember that too.
4601606	4602167	Yeah.
4602187	4607433	Speaking of Ingress, one of my favorite episodes was when we had all the ladies that play the game here.
4607473	4616342	Not all of them, but a good chunk of the ladies that play the game here locally came to the studio and we all did a show and that was like my fucking favorite because
4617655	4629016	I want to look back on that and go uplifting all these badass fucking women that are putting together sting operations in video games.
4629036	4630800	I loved that we could showcase that.
4631581	4635208	And that was that's I'm very proud of that particular moment.
4635188	4639676	I would say, though, honestly, you know, right around that same era, what else really made me happy?
4640116	4648831	Our partnership that we had with our indie game development scene for a while here, which was SAC IGDA for a hot minute, and then it became the Capital Creators Showcase.
4648851	4657126	I will admit, we've sort of kind of lost direction with that since COVID and everything, but I get the emails now and then, and I'm like, damn it, I really need to go reconnect with that group.
4657146	4660251	Because I actually did go to one of their shows, it was last year, I think.
4660231	4662336	Which was really good.
4662357	4667269	And so I'm really glad that we could uplift and support indie voices in that regard.
4667289	4669716	So that was also a really favorite memory of mine.
4670177	4675270	If I were to go old school... God...
4678135	4679917	I have to really think about that.
4679937	4684182	I would probably say when we got to debut Ultramix 4 soundtrack songs.
4684202	4685824	That felt fucking incredible.
4686285	4694755	That this franchise that we were such fans of and had created a show to support the community of came full circle and really recognized us.
4695577	4699381	And the person that was behind that, Stillwind was the producer's name.
4699441	4702024	He passed away some time ago, unfortunately.
4702044	4705729	And I will always be thankful to him for...
4705709	4725945	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4725925	4735396	There's a lot of stuff in OLR's history where I go, it hasn't aged well, be careful, things change, and the way society looks at things change, so be careful.
4735856	4742103	But that particular episode and a lot of the things that came up, that is great still, I think.
4745447	4750212	Let's see, any other, DarkSakura, Loki, well you said Dunk, Loki, anything for you?
4750647	4774461	uh i think just like some of the even like the remote shows that we did like from tournaments were kind of fun uh well i guess it wasn't necessarily uh podcast shows but like some of those were pretty fun um like from e3 and everything um the pixel poops direct was fun oh yeah you really blew us away on that fried twinkies
4775926	4776587	Let's see.
4777208	4790827	I think like having everybody just in like the apartment and everything back when we had the webcam through the eye toy that was every 10 seconds was just fun to just hang out with everybody.
4790987	4792409	And can we all pour one out?
4792429	4798158	You know, with the show ending, it is obvious that now the Eye of Judgment will never sell a million copies.
4798218	4800521	And unfortunately, Loki will never dress up as Tingle.
4801142	4803645	And that's that's maybe the saddest news of all.
4803665	4805528	That's the saddest news of all.
4807094	4808556	We had the artwork that was made.
4809096	4816966	I won a thing from... It was for kickstarting a game that one of our listeners was a part of.
4816986	4817466	I don't remember.
4818007	4820049	I think it was JVmon?
4820410	4820690	Maybe?
4821291	4822532	I don't know.
4822673	4828540	They kickstarted a game and one of their artists would draw something.
4828620	4830442	So I had them draw me as Tingle.
4830642	4833085	We posted that a long time ago on social media.
4833706	4835431	It tingles in our album right now.
4835672	4839864	I have more pictures to share with our live folks that came through for Discord.
4839884	4840265	You ready?
4840786	4842010	Y'all are dumping old pictures here.
4842030	4847485	And if you, on the podcast feed, if you want to see it, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and these are all on the OLR channel.
4847505	4848548	You'll just have to scroll up a little bit.
4848568	4849150	I'm going to have to find it.
4849130	4871982	and some pictures again.
4872181	4885300	I'm sure Grandpa would love to tell you the story of somebody else in that community who at this same event, I'm sitting down and this person runs up and open mouth kisses me to say hello.
4888085	4890488	There's some very strange memories I have from the past.
4893372	4893893	Oh my god.
4894654	4897539	Oh my god, this picture I just found.
4898079	4899842	Let's see, this is...
4901915	4922472	GamerX, Captain Spike, Slaggy, Gameboy.org
4922452	4924235	And that's Jason.
4924355	4928941	And I can't remember the name of his podcast, but I know his name was Jason because we're still in touch on LinkedIn.
4929382	4932326	That's Jeremy and Phil from Koopa Club at the time.
4932706	4936091	And that's Fox Van Allen, who is moderating that panel in the corner.
4936131	4938555	And then that's me over here on the left.
4938735	4939356	Game Bar.
4939416	4939776	That was it.
4939796	4940277	Thank you, Slaggy.
4940297	4940918	It was Game Bar.
4940958	4941879	G-A-Y-M-E Bar.
4942480	4943582	So that was fun.
4943602	4950872	That was the first... That was right... This was moments before I had a claustrophobia panic attack because these...
4950852	4953795	Look how low that ceiling is.
4953815	4959401	And these doors led to a very crowded hallway that I had a claustrophobia panic attack.
4959541	4959801	Yay.
4961223	4970592	This is a clip from PodCulture of us presenting at the Parsec Awards one year where Bobby was doing some VR joke.
4970752	4975877	And I don't remember the joke, but you'll have to take my word it was really funny.
4975897	4976438	Um...
4977515	4980779	And then I can't believe this got left out.
4981741	4983603	Bobby Blackwolf with this picture.
4987068	4992135	Us broadcasting live at PAX 2008 with all games right there.
4992195	4992675	Look at that.
4992996	4994318	There's Bobby Blackwolf.
4994638	4995439	There's me.
4996280	4999084	I do not remember her name.
4999486	5001349	She was on Dead Pixel Live.
5002050	5002811	Thank you, Loserly.
5003632	5005054	DarkSakura's over there and Loki's over here.
5005675	5009180	So that was us broadcasting at PAX.
5010021	5011343	That was pretty incredible.
5011924	5013025	So, yeah.
5015348	5016730	Why did she call herself Loser?
5016831	5017992	She was not a loser.
5018293	5019975	She was a nice person from what I remember.
5021120	5023344	Even if I have a hard time remembering people's names.
5023865	5024085	All right.
5024105	5025708	And then what are these last pictures you're sending me?
5025748	5026710	Oh, these are more recent.
5026730	5026830	Okay.
5026850	5027711	I'm gonna start with this one.
5028092	5028893	One is more recent.
5028913	5029114	Okay.
5029134	5031518	This one is, I'm gonna start with the second one.
5031598	5035865	So this is you and Jennifer Hale at Gamer X2, right?
5036727	5036967	Yeah.
5037168	5037388	Yeah.
5038350	5039472	That was before my surgery.
5039492	5040313	Or was it three?
5040333	5040513	No.
5041034	5042577	Three was at the San Jose.
5042617	5044240	This is the San Jose Convention Center.
5044400	5044881	This is three.
5044901	5045001	Okay.
5045521	5047143	Yeah, that was three, because I didn't go to the first one.
5048384	5048624	Yeah.
5048804	5062899	And then, probably the most recent picture, this is us getting together for episode 1000, about two years ago at this point, if you can believe it, at Sunsplash, and we are having a cry because our old stomping grounds kind of sucks now.
5064921	5065641	For reals.
5065661	5066402	Yeah, kinda.
5066802	5069805	Or, like, really sucks right now.
5069825	5070166	Alright.
5070766	5071327	That was fun.
5071347	5074330	I think I found some California Extreme stuff, but...
5074411	5075332	That's all right.
5075673	5080419	And every time you send me a message, the entire listenership is hearing a Discord ping, so it's all right.
5080619	5081280	Sorry!
5081300	5081621	No, it's fine.
5081641	5083183	Don't worry about sending me any more right now.
5083363	5086067	Sorry, I'm in streamer mode, so it's supposed to be muted.
5086347	5091755	But it might be because I have the website open as well, because I have to have like two copies of Discord open to show these things.
5092215	5092516	So anyway.
5092536	5094659	Well, I can't really find any others right now.
5094679	5096261	Can I ping you one more time then?
5096281	5097422	All right, one more time.
5097583	5099025	I don't have the good picture.
5099045	5100807	All right, incoming Discord ping.
5100787	5101688	Here we go.
5101948	5116707	This is when I was, like, mocking up t-shirts, so I pasted the image onto the t-shirt, but it's not the full... But in case people haven't seen the Loki's Tingle drawing, there you go.
5117448	5120372	Why didn't we ever... Why didn't we ever sell that shirt?
5121794	5123196	We could have made money off that.
5123876	5124297	Oh, well.
5126690	5151853	I'm just going to go ahead and put this out right now I always wanted to do that memory book
5151968	5153770	and I still fucking want to do it.
5154792	5164524	So I want everyone to find me on Discord and I want to write up and pictures because I'm going to make the damn book.
5165165	5165806	It's going to happen.
5167068	5169110	I say this full of alcohol and spite.
5169250	5169891	It's going to happen.
5169931	5171293	All right.
5172303	5173806	We have a few headlines left.
5173826	5179057	We do talk about video game news, and I said if anything big happened this week, we talk about it.
5179538	5188436	So Loki, I'd like you to walk us through a few news stories that happened here, here on our last news rundown, so we can give our big fat opinions on them.
5188456	5189839	Loki, what happened in the news this week?
5189819	5214763	so they they made the nominees for the game awards um and it was all basically everything everything Expedition 33 um you know clear obscure so that's great um and uh with that though of course uh there's also a little bit um coming out of that as far as
5214743	5230242	We had one of the nominees actually decline the nomination, and that would have been for Best Independent Game, or no, I'm sorry, Best Debut Indie Game, which was Megabonk.
5230262	5233466	And, you know, it's because it's Danny Dev, okay?
5233486	5238192	Like, he puts his name backwards on there, but it's still Danny Dev, and he's released other games.
5239013	5239333	Um...
5240275	5242279	but yeah, we'll pretend he's a different person, that's fine.
5243160	5261915	Anyways, nominees with the Game Awards, we had some of the notable stuff, let's see, so Game of the Year, Claire Obscure, Expedition 33, Death Stranding 2, On a Beach, Donkey Kong, Bonanza, Hades 2, Hollow Knight, Silksong, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.
5263238	5263498	Um...
5263478	5265061	And we don't need every category.
5265201	5266223	Let's be real.
5266704	5268047	Claire Obscure is going to sweep.
5268207	5275981	This is like the year Titanic got nominated for like 11 billion Oscars and then it won them all.
5276843	5279167	And that's what's going to happen with Claire Obscure this year.
5279288	5280610	And it's not like...
5280590	5282034	It's deserved.
5282054	5284863	It's one of those things where I feel like there's so much.
5284883	5294110	And for all the arguments of, is Claire Obscure really an indie game and all this, it is a game that was sort of necessary this year.
5294242	5310985	and I think for that reason it's going to get recognized the only way this doesn't win is if people feel some sort of backlash to that inevitable conclusion that it's going to run away and that's where I could see a Silksong or a Hades
5310965	5317432	to take it, is that maybe they want to uplift an even indier game than 33.
5317572	5322077	But I just don't see this ending any other way than Expedition 33 winning.
5322398	5323479	And that's okay.
5323499	5326862	Sometimes that foregone conclusion is the right one.
5326882	5330587	It probably is the game of the year.
5331307	5337394	Even if it's not technically an indie game, the fact that it harkens back to...
5337560	5340584	What you would consider old school game mechanics.
5340644	5348654	Not everything has to be, you know, real-time action and full of microtransactions and with all this other stuff.
5348674	5354942	Like, it can be just, hey, remember how we used to make games, Japanese RPGs back in the day?
5355283	5356244	Yeah, let's do that again.
5357586	5358767	And wow, look, it worked.
5359388	5362372	Who would have thought that people liked the things that they liked before?
5362813	5364034	That's so crazy.
5364615	5364715	Yeah.
5364779	5367410	That they would do that and like the things.
5368293	5369759	Nobody likes nostalgia?
5369920	5370402	No!
5370422	5372089	Of course not.
5372474	5377421	I just think, yeah, and Bobby is saying, but it's very time focused.
5377441	5380285	You need very fast Twitch reflexes to do well in it.
5380746	5393163	And that makes me think about how people are always like, oh, or the creators of Final Fantasy, even Yoshi P, who I respect greatly because he saved 14, says, you can't do a Final Fantasy.
5393343	5394825	That's not what people want on next gen.
5395086	5397289	And Claire Obscure really proved that wrong.
5397609	5400473	And I think Claire Obscure is going to impact
5400453	5401615	Final Fantasy 17.
5402177	5413500	I think the reason why we haven't had a Final Fantasy 17 reveal yet is now that development team is basically having to say, how do we make this more like Claire Obscure?
5414324	5438998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5440480	5469272	yes one quick other note on Game Awards obviously we did not get the Half-Life 3 news this week, big shock left at the altar again by Gabe although it's our fucking fault for buying these fucking rumors every single god damn time they fool us, do you think on the wheel of plausibility, 0 being no, 10 being yeah it's gonna happen, on the wheel of plausibility Half-Life 3 showing up at the Game Awards
5474517	5502820	I can see that, or maybe...
5502800	5508769	I don't know if they're going to be showing this stuff off more at like CES or something.
5508809	5512215	Although they don't really do game announcements around CES, but maybe.
5512235	5512535	Who knows?
5513156	5513457	I don't know.
5514258	5515240	We'll announce it when they're ready.
5515380	5516662	I give it a one.
5516782	5517824	I give it a one.
5517844	5518805	I don't think it's happening either.
5520848	5521209	All right.
5522110	5522691	Let's move on.
5522731	5526297	Some sad news this week, but we need to pay our respects.
5526337	5527018	Right, Loki?
5527640	5538254	Yeah, so unfortunately Rebecca Heinemann has died at age 62 after a battle with... Very aggressive cancer.
5538754	5540396	Yeah, very aggressive cancer.
5541738	5552792	But if you don't recognize the game, she had worked on lots of different games including Baldur's Gate, Wasteland, and Fallout.
5552812	5554795	A whole ton of Mac ports too.
5555939	5557541	Yeah, a whole bunch of games.
5558041	5562206	And, excuse me.
5563708	5568333	Yeah, so lots of classic games from, I know, our youth.
5568773	5580787	And, of course, you know, mentioning Myth 3, The Wolf Age, Heroes of Might and Magic 4, Baldur's Gate 2, also the 3D Outport of Doom.
5581087	5581187	Yeah.
5581623	5586790	And she is a trans pioneer as well in the industry.
5587371	5594200	And that's why you probably don't recognize her name being associated with those games because she was credited under another name.
5594641	5596803	She was on the GLAAD board of directors as well.
5598826	5603192	From my understanding from people that have worked in the industry, this woman touched
5603172	5632875	almost everything like you don't even know the things that she influenced and it's pretty incredible her impact so I really hate that this is a headline on our last show but we have to pay our respects so rest in power now moving on to things that got the internet set ablaze this is oh Loki the entire internet's panties are on fire yeah the internet already shit itself this week we don't need a Half-Life 3 trailer
5633277	5640825	They just had the first official pictures of the Legend of Zelda movie.
5640845	5644288	You know how they do those kind of set shots and stuff like that.
5644969	5647592	Screenshot out of the thing.
5647632	5657221	There's also been more production videos that have been leaking as well, which don't really show a whole ton, but everybody wants to speculate about what they're seeing.
5657922	5659243	Yeah, I mean, I think it'll be cool.
5659363	5660164	The casting looks good.
5660645	5660905	Yeah.
5662150	5664894	It's giving me definitely a Breath of the Wild vibe.
5666157	5670624	Yeah, so it'll be interesting to see what it was actually going to what's going to look like.
5670704	5672246	But yeah, I'm excited.
5674210	5676053	I have to call this out a little bit.
5676193	5678076	This is what's wild to me about this story.
5678096	5679478	We get three pictures, right?
5679538	5681762	And yeah, the actors look good.
5683413	5686377	The content some people make around this.
5686397	5687538	I want to show you guys something.
5687578	5690041	And this is a live YouTube search.
5690061	5690302	Okay.
5690682	5695308	This is a live YouTube search for Zelda movie for things in the past week.
5695909	5696029	Okay.
5696589	5697511	And you've got things.
5697611	5699733	Actually, what is the longest video?
5699773	5700635	Oh, we can't sort by.
5701275	5702797	Oh, duration over 20 minutes.
5702817	5704199	Do we have anything that's over 20 minutes?
5704459	5705080	We sure do.
5705100	5707463	23 minute first look discussion.
5707443	5734868	three three pictures leads to this uh first look discussion uh one hour three minutes i mean these and to be fair these are podcasts where this is probably just one particular topic but it is wild to me that like how long people will talk about basically what is like three pictures and then there's just like this weird shit weird shit i don't even know what else to call this meltdown legend of zelda movie casting causes outrage from the they thems
5735962	5738605	12 Minutes, The Legend of Zelda.
5738685	5740106	Oh, no, that's a different one.
5740186	5740667	Fake Trails.
5740687	5742408	I'm actually watching a little bit of a short.
5742829	5743450	Seven Minutes.
5744030	5747994	I thought there was another one that was like, oh, libs are so mad about this sort of thing.
5748014	5749996	And I'm just like, what the fuck?
5750697	5752378	What the fuck?
5752399	5755602	Like, you literally can say anything on the internet.
5756202	5759666	You literally can say anything on the internet.
5759686	5761868	And people do it on YouTube.
5761848	5766615	and it's hard to compete with some of that, which is so sad.
5766636	5767196	So sad.
5767216	5769720	Yeah, rage generates clicks, says Bobby Blackwolf.
5769740	5770762	It's sad, but it's true.
5771163	5772124	And I hope, you know what?
5773346	5780878	There are several parting messages I'm sure we will give you throughout the night, but there is one big thing we can give you to take away.
5780898	5783502	It's please don't
5784578	5792268	Please don't give these rage baiters, these rage debaters, please do not uplift these rage debaters.
5793049	5802502	There are so many positive indie shows and people that really enjoy video games and people that uplift this industry.
5802522	5804684	Those are the things that need to be retweeted.
5804704	5806887	Those are the things that need to be quote posted about.
5806947	5810432	Those are the things that need to be uplifted and shared with friends.
5811133	5813556	Leave the rage debaters behind.
5814498	5817742	They're not good enough for your attention.
5817762	5820566	And yeah, it all goes back to one of those topics we were talking about earlier.
5820586	5821787	Absolutely.
5821807	5822909	Anyway.
5822929	5823209	All right.
5823590	5825612	I just had to bring that up because it was one of those things I just knew.
5825632	5831880	When I saw those three pictures, I was like, where are the 17-minute YouTubes talking about these three pictures?
5831900	5832921	Never disappointed.
5832941	5835385	Never disappointed in those types of predictions.
5835405	5837567	But also a little disappointed.
5837587	5839269	All right.
5839870	5840251	One more.
5840611	5842113	One more big thing that happened this week.
5842173	5842834	Loki.
5843270	5845033	Xbox said things.
5845353	5848378	They have games coming out by their partners.
5848759	5851804	And yeah, and more Game Pass announcements and stuff.
5851824	5852184	I don't know.
5852685	5853466	Some of it looked good.
5854929	5855810	Anything that caught your eye?
5857353	5867930	There's the one that's based off of, oh God, it's called... I'll say the Vampire Survivors card game while you're thinking.
5867950	5868711	There was that.
5868731	5869292	I did see that.
5869312	5870053	That looked cute.
5870573	5898673	Vampire Crawlers, thank you Captain Spike, I couldn't remember the name at the moment
5898907	5911059	Yeah, other than that, like, I didn't, I kind of skimmed through some of the other stuff, and there wasn't a whole lot that, like, jumped out at me as, like, kind of, wow, you know, I gotta, I gotta get me this.
5911660	5913421	Um, I don't know.
5914963	5921049	But, yeah, I mean, it, I'm always, uh, good to see new games coming up.
5921690	5924693	I, Microsoft kind of needed to play a card this week.
5925373	5926274	Zoopunk, that's what it was.
5926514	5927175	Zoopunk.
5927392	5951577	All right.
5952130	5961161	I was going to say, Microsoft sort of needed some good news and needed to play this card this week because that news, I mean, there's just been a lot of negative, negative news.
5961602	5963164	I still don't think they're really in the clear.
5963364	5966788	I still think they have a long way to justify the new price of Game Pass.
5968050	5976220	But, you know, and a lot of people are noting that the Fortnite partnership started, but I don't know anybody that is excited about Game Pass right now.
5976240	5978222	And this is Microsoft's attempt to do that.
5978624	5979746	That's the other thing, though.
5979886	5987416	So, Zoopunk looks cool, but then, as Mike Deff pointed out, is apparently a game that's going to let people use AI to create mods.
5989599	5994266	So, yeah, you have a good game, and then they mar it with that nonsense that doesn't need to be in there.
5994406	5995647	Like, ugh, fine.
5996789	5999653	But, the Echo Generations 2, I guess.
6000089	6009594	Well, from new games to classic games, one more time, DarkSakura is here with a retro pick for us.
6009614	6013103	Let's get to the bumper one last time here on Orange Launch Radio.
6023596	6046532	DarkSakura.com
6047086	6075895	Sukiban Shacho Rena for the Wii.
6077765	6078967	Yes, of course.
6079508	6080289	Come on.
6080329	6082032	How could we not?
6082052	6085497	I think most people are going to be like, how did you not pick this yet?
6087340	6089343	Because I just haven't.
6089784	6097556	So it is an action game that was developed by Jorudan for the Wii, and it was available only in Japan.
6099219	6103806	It is also the last known video game to be developed by Jorudan.
6103786	6116910	Um, but you play as, uh, a cat named Rena, who is the mascot for a blog named Neckle Punch and is also the CEO of a fictional company called Cat Queen Incorporated.
6117552	6123703	And so your job is you're a new employee and you have to appease Rena.
6124965	6126368	So, um,
6126483	6148457	Yeah, so you have a bunch of mini-games to play where you take control of a cat or some other humans and you have to play the piano or dodge cats or take money from a cat when it's not looking or dance for Rena and you use the Wii Remote or the Nunchuk to play the game.
6150961	6152423	This game...
6152588	6154190	We wanted it to be great, y'all.
6154210	6155551	We wanted it to be great.
6155731	6158574	This was the game that got us put on Destructoid.
6163259	6168644	Because I was trying to describe the name of what a Shacho was.
6170626	6172528	Because I knew what these words meant, right?
6173409	6177874	And Sukiban is like a delinquent.
6177894	6180216	You get more of the...
6180787	6188336	Cultural, the appearance one would think of would be like the girl in the really long... Think Zaki from Rival Schools.
6189618	6190940	Think Zaki from Rival Schools.
6191400	6198830	It'd be like the long skirt and, you know, like with a yo-yo or like chains or something.
6198850	6199871	She's the delinquent girl.
6201453	6209443	But Shacho is...
6211533	6212234	Nevermind.
6212254	6212534	Sorry.
6215677	6217498	But anyway... Yes, thank you.
6217518	6219140	There you go.
6220161	6223363	But Shacho is like the head of a company.
6223604	6224665	The president of a company.
6225205	6227467	And that was where we were getting President Cat from.
6228468	6232712	So it was like more like delinquent CEO Rena.
6235975	6237496	I do not know if you can pet the cat.
6237616	6239818	Loki can answer that because Loki has the game.
6240068	6241771	I haven't played it enough.
6241791	6243254	And he won't let me steal it from him.
6244096	6245979	You have it, I think.
6245999	6246741	I thought I gave it to you.
6246761	6247863	You can pirate it now.
6248844	6249325	Did you?
6249386	6250427	I don't think you did.
6251650	6254134	Someone has it, but maybe I still do.
6254555	6257401	But yeah, I have it on my portable handheld thing.
6257541	6259004	Because I want to play the shit out of it.
6259304	6259965	I'm going to stream it.
6259985	6261889	I was hoping someone would fan translate it.
6261909	6262971	That would be nice, but...
6263913	6268464	You can find it out there on the internet archive somewhere.
6268825	6270649	Excellent point that Loki brings up.
6271551	6276002	Let me wait until Jamie's done because I don't want to cut her off with anything that has to do with us.
6276022	6278428	Well, at any rate...
6279910	6300383	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6301190	6310405	People thought it was really funny, but that it really didn't have a lot of different content and the minigames weren't all that great.
6310425	6314832	There wasn't really a lot of variety.
6315734	6322164	And the Neko Punch blog is gone, although I think you can weigh back it.
6324388	6325189	But I mean...
6326435	6334003	For us, this was just a thing for us, you know?
6334684	6338207	We made something trend, okay?
6338548	6339569	We made it trend.
6342272	6350400	And let me see, because there is a link to the Destructoid article, and I will...
6352979	6359072	Oh god, it links back to our article on the OLR website, so I'll put that in there.
6359193	6360476	There's the link.
6361317	6364244	You'll have to look around for it.
6364264	6370658	It's the grassroots effort to localize President Kat Rena Begins.
6370678	6372422	But yeah, we tried.
6372841	6373783	We tried, everybody.
6373983	6374344	We tried.
6374524	6384704	And that's kind of what I wanted to say in follow-up to what Loki was saying about this game and the localized and all that stuff is that I do not regret what we tried to do.
6385265	6391877	I do not regret it, and I'm not going to apologize for it because in many ways, I know it kind of got taken as a joke.
6392298	6393921	It wasn't a fucking joke.
6393901	6408366	I don't remember if it was this site or another site that sort of very tongue-in-cheek said, don't know if it would really be worth it for them to localize this because it's probably not a very good game at the end of the day, so maybe we shouldn't be getting their hopes up that it would actually do well here.
6408747	6409648	Here's the fucking thing.
6410129	6417141	Do you remember, since we're reflecting back, do you remember just how much shovelware and piss we were getting on the Nintendo Wii?
6417121	6420565	Absolutely piss games we were getting on the Nintendo Wii.
6420946	6425412	It was so bad it was like throwing back to the Atari 2600 before the game crashed.
6425432	6428495	There were so many terrible games.
6429036	6436966	And it's not that President Cat was necessarily going to be like a fucking Claire Obscure of its time, that it was going to be a winning game.
6436986	6439810	But look at this mini game that's playing right now on Twitch.
6439850	6446318	And for those of you in the podcast feed, it's a music game with a person and a cat playing the piano.
6446551	6448895	Right?
6448915	6470972	Right?
6470952	6487138	you will never know how this game would do in America and if it would have been a big meme success because you didn't try and I get that maybe this game had some licensing things and some other things were but there were other games similar enough where I'm just like I really wish more
6487118	6488720	GameMakers in this time.
6488740	6491903	And I feel like it is better now because a lot more consoles are region free.
6492204	6493826	The Wii wasn't region free.
6493846	6496689	We're now in more of a global economy when it comes to video games.
6497009	6505138	But I just, I don't regret trying to make President Cat happen because I think we could have used a big stupid game like this.
6505158	6507681	It's cats being silly.
6507701	6517092	You tell me how that was going to be any worse than like Barbie Gem Adventure, you know, things.
6517291	6520377	Yeah, Drew String in chat says, sometimes we just want to play a silly, dumb game.
6520497	6521880	Exactly.
6521900	6528272	Now, funny enough, there was a game that came out years later called Cap President, which had nothing to do with this or the campaign.
6528312	6529174	The guy had no idea.
6529194	6533863	It was more of a commentary on political elections going on at the time because we reached out to that guy.
6533903	6535646	Did he come on the show?
6535866	6536608	He did.
6536628	6538251	Okay, he did come on the show and promote it.
6539133	6539333	Aww.
6539313	6548041	So, you know, it's funny because it had nothing to do with this game, but, you know, it ended up, we ended up getting a President Cat type of game, but it was very, very, very, very, very different.
6549622	6550683	Yeah, I still want President Midna.
6553065	6553225	Yeah.
6553245	6557189	Okay, anything else to say about President Cat, DarkSakura, our final classic game of the week?
6558269	6564495	I'm just awing at, like, the flowery picture of Renna running toward the dude with love.
6568038	6568138	Sigh.
6569215	6571298	Oh my gosh, this is so funny.
6571318	6576546	So, SSJ100Map found this and apologized for giving us this website.
6576626	6577908	No, this is okay.
6577928	6582796	The RenaWe Twitter account is still active and it says, thank you so much.
6583497	6586742	Talked about it on their radio show and it looks like an interesting game to play.
6586802	6591129	This was the tweet that proves President Cat knows we exist.
6591149	6592370	And Actdeft, for what it's worth.
6593953	6594313	You know what?
6594734	6595495	Screenshot time.
6596196	6597298	This is going in the book.
6597869	6626020	yeah it should you might want to look through some of their other tweets around that period because it was legendary stuff the official account for female president Rena Wee see they took the name alright for the record I actually had for the longest time my Webex picture was Rena oh funny at work
6626320	6629705	That's funny.
6629725	6630045	Alright.
6630206	6633030	And then I changed it to Charlie the Unicorn.
6635533	6639579	I want to go to our next segment, which usually we would talk about release dates.
6639899	6642984	Obviously that seems... What's that, Jamie?
6643004	6644245	Oh, I'm just being right back.
6644265	6645227	Oh, okay.
6645347	6652137	I want to get into our next segment about release dates, which usually we would travel around the world and read out what's coming out to you this week.
6652157	6655922	But since, you know, we're done...
6660492	6675413	I thought maybe we could just kind of look generally at the rest of 2025 and if there's anything that you are excited about that's coming out like any notable things that are coming out that maybe you want to talk a little bit about here coming out for the rest of the year.
6676540	6687694	Um, I'd probably pick up Sonic Racing Crossworlds when it comes out on the Switch 2, which is supposed to be in a week or so on the 4th of December.
6687835	6690038	So that's something I've been looking forward to picking up.
6690118	6692581	I think I might also have it on PC, though.
6693662	6696967	But I know we'd get more play out of it on the Switch 2.
6696987	6698869	Um...
6699743	6700805	I don't know what this is.
6700865	6703570	This Terminator 2D No Fate.
6703971	6707797	I don't know if that's based off of like the old arcade game or if that's some new thing.
6708659	6710082	Might be cool to check out.
6711644	6720961	And there was another one that was just I think I got to look at that Dinkum game that came out earlier this year.
6721883	6722344	Dinkum?
6722364	6723726	I hardly knew him.
6724246	6724668	Exactly.
6724848	6729826	Actually, I've seen Mish on socials really praising that game, so there must be something about it.
6730629	6734564	Yeah, there's that one, and then there's another one, too, I just wish-listed.
6735226	6735808	Um...
6736463	6738927	I just wishlisted it yesterday, actually.
6739628	6741210	Let me, I gotta pull this up real quick.
6741911	6745516	It was, it's another game similar to that.
6745536	6758635	It reminded me of, like, an Animal Crossing crossed with, like, almost, like, gang beasts in the sense that, like, you're running around as a little animal, like, anthropomorphic animals.
6758655	6760077	But it looked pretty cool.
6760257	6764143	It was Pow Pow is what it's called.
6764203	6765525	P-A-O-P-A-O
6766805	6769466	and yeah, look kind of interesting.
6770292	6770655	All right.
6771732	6774735	Looking at Japan, obviously there's a lot of similar releases.
6774755	6780661	I don't think there's anything coming out drastically different from here, especially with the AAA games.
6781042	6786407	Obviously Metroid Prime 4 is probably the biggest thing I'm still looking forward to that we're going to have on December 4th.
6786427	6789811	And that's going to be a big release in Japan, Switch and Switch 2 edition.
6790351	6792994	Octopath Traveler I think will be on a lot of people's radars as well.
6793074	6798600	And Octopath Traveler Zero is getting its release on the 4th of December, which I know is going to be exciting for a lot of people.
6798580	6821044	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6821024	6823468	and I think really that's most of the stuff on my radar.
6823488	6829238	I'm looking really quick to see if there's anything on PlayStation 5 for the rest of the year that might be on my radar.
6833144	6834226	I don't think so for me.
6835889	6841858	They are selling the Final Fantasy 7 remake, integrate and rebirth as a dual pack, which I think is interesting.
6841878	6844062	But I think most people are caught up on that at this point.
6845510	6849899	Maybe people are excited for Yakuza being redone, the original.
6850620	6852404	Zero, one, and two are all happening.
6852424	6855389	I'm more excited about all these indie games that we don't know about.
6856191	6859237	I have to even go back to my wish list and stuff.
6859257	6860980	There's this one right now that just came out.
6861862	6864868	Actually, just came out on Friday.
6865203	6868087	Last week, called Neon Inferno.
6868728	6869649	And it looks amazing.
6869749	6877819	It's like a Gunstar Heroes, Contra, Metal Slug-looking game.
6878761	6879802	And it's like a little indie game.
6880042	6881404	It's definitely worth picking.
6881424	6883447	I mean, it's gorgeous.
6883787	6884268	Check it out.
6884428	6887532	I mean, there's so many that are out there.
6888777	6909381	DarkSakura, as you look at Europe release dates, is there anything you're looking forward to for the rest of the year?
6914407	6916489	Bubble Bobble Sugar Dimensions?
6917228	6944400	Star Ocean is my classic, not my classic game, but my retro game.
6944971	6953057	I'm trying to decide but yeah nothing really maybe Bubble Bobble I like Bubble Bobble who doesn't?
6953527	6963976	Actually, it was pointed out to me that one of these machines, my little Evercade, the Mega Man one I have, apparently they're going to be doing one for Taito as well.
6963996	6966859	And so Bubble Bobble will be on that, I think, New Zealand story.
6967259	6969981	But the Evercade cartridges already exist.
6970001	6975106	So technically I could just get the cartridges and it would be like the same thing, but if I wanted like a branded machine.
6975146	6979950	But maybe – I don't know if you have any interest in one of these, DarkSakura, but maybe a Taito one would be up your alley.
6980170	6981591	But yeah.
6981611	6983533	I've been keeping an eye on the Evercade stuff.
6983513	6986959	you know how much crap I have in my house I hear ya, I hear ya
6987412	6988393	We got too much pinball.
6988954	6989895	All right.
6989915	6996382	After this segment, we will be opening up our phone lines over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6996462	6999485	Depending on how many of you are in there, we may have a time limit tonight.
6999505	7005272	So I just would ask before you call in, please try to keep your thoughts succinct, if you will.
7005372	7011759	We also have, if there are multiple people waiting in the green room, we have a channel called, we made something, we did something new tonight.
7012280	7014482	We made a channel called You Are Next.
7014462	7020154	So at any point you may be zooped into that channel that says you are next and that'll let you know you're going to be the next one on.
7020174	7021016	So be ready for it.
7021157	7022941	So just be ready for that.
7022961	7028392	So we will be opening up the... You can go to the green room now if you want, but we will be opening it up officially in just a moment.
7028412	7031880	But we have one more segment to get to and that is...
7032603	7034064	An OLR Foodio.
7034925	7046915	Because it came to our attention, and this is really dark to see it, it said, you know, you collected all those points in chat to do an OLR Foodio and you never did one.
7047215	7050118	And I think the listeners all understand why.
7050138	7059846	They know that right when that happened, I ended up getting diagnosed with diabetes and I had a little bit of like food association kind of rough stuff for a minute there.
7059906	7061968	So I didn't really want to talk about food.
7061948	7083332	DarkSakura, how was your foodie week?
7083835	7095255	Well, I'm eating chocolate powdered cashews with espresso coated powdered hazelnuts.
7096256	7102587	But Dan made fillets tonight with mac and cheese.
7102988	7131814	And it was alright, you know, it felt kind of like fancy, yet college And I've just basically gone off my diet all week because I didn't give a shit Took Monday off of ballet I'm just eating, I'm enjoying myself Because I'm back on getting ready for ballet recital But yeah, I made a really good quesadilla the other day
7132030	7138718	I really am addicted to the BB Go chicken and vegetable soup dumplings.
7138738	7141761	Really addicted, really.
7143884	7150732	Oh, work had this amazing mushroom Swiss burger and really good fries.
7151933	7153255	And I had that this week.
7153315	7155657	I actually ate at work.
7155677	7159442	Although I was thinking about getting one of the pizza, but I mean, the food at my work.
7159482	7160603	I can't say where I work.
7161157	7185460	but the food at work is really freaking good when they don't put like peppers all over the fucking place and oh yeah I did have carrot cake last week and I made poutine for myself actually since Fantas mentioned it I didn't really have like legit poutine stuff but I had some curry gravy
7186132	7206098	DarkSakura.com
7208643	7209745	I would say that's about it.
7209765	7211768	Well, that and I'm also boozing.
7212769	7213430	Yes, you are.
7213670	7218417	So I will tell you right now, the Borgiata chocolate liqueur is better than Godiva.
7219519	7220581	You get dark chocolate.
7220641	7221742	You can get chocolate mint.
7221762	7223866	You can get orange chocolate.
7224046	7226309	And it's cheaper and more delightful.
7226890	7228933	And it's thick, like with two C's.
7229834	7232118	And it makes a really fucking good drink.
7232398	7233840	I always pronounce thick with two C's.
7233880	7234341	Chlanta.
7234401	7235022	Thick-k.
7237533	7238334	L'chaim!
7239976	7241198	Loki, how was your foodie week?
7242720	7244802	Pretty uneventful, I would say.
7244842	7245323	You didn't eat?
7246464	7247466	I didn't get that much.
7247646	7252933	I got these cool sweet heat snack mix from Costco.
7253193	7254014	So I got that.
7256617	7259241	My sage and brown butter popcorn.
7259781	7263506	That's a thing that Safeway's been putting out for the holidays as well.
7263886	7264367	I bought...
7265495	7267578	I think these are going to be good.
7267598	7270323	Every time I see weird flavored lays, I pick them up.
7271404	7274169	They had salted caramel today.
7274950	7275912	Yeah, what's that like?
7275952	7277995	I mean, I hate caramel, but is it good?
7278015	7278336	I don't know.
7278356	7279998	I haven't tried them yet.
7280018	7281781	I have not tried them yet.
7281801	7282542	Live on air.
7282743	7283464	Live on air.
7285006	7285427	One sec.
7286251	7290399	I guess I'm going to talk about my foodie week then while you get prepped for that so we don't have dead air.
7290980	7292402	So my foodie week.
7293504	7294887	We went to Chili's last night.
7294987	7295729	That was exciting.
7295749	7300057	We do date night once a week, and we did fine dining at Chili's this week.
7300077	7303483	But I will say the thing that Chili's does that I think is really –
7303463	7304104	Did you know?
7304284	7306808	So they're selling these special margaritas right now.
7306828	7309793	The Wicked Witch Brew and the Good Witch Brew or something like that.
7310234	7313879	So it's like implied that they are Wicked tie-ins.
7314420	7314941	But here's the thing.
7314961	7315942	They're not.
7315963	7316483	They're not.
7316503	7319468	Nowhere on their advertisement does it say the movie Wicked.
7319869	7322653	Does it show Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande?
7323054	7323494	None of that.
7323955	7325057	It doesn't show any of that.
7325077	7329724	So it's like when you have the Super Bowl and the restaurant does the specials for the big game.
7329704	7342741	And on Chili's part, this is so smart because we were right across from a table of like six women who were probably either going to or coming back from seeing the movie who all had one of those margaritas.
7343141	7346986	And all over TikTok, I see people drinking them both at once.
7347327	7354516	I think that's one of the most genius marketing things Chili's has particularly done is those branded drinks without actually being branded.
7355337	7356218	Wild.
7356552	7378307	well otherwise yeah i i like i like the soup even even though don't tell me how Chili's makes their soup i know i'm gonna be disappointed let me have shitty comfort food let me have shitty comfort food exactly it's just like the olive garden minestrone it's from a can or it's like a big barrel that they make it but you know what craft mac and cheese is from a box what
7378878	7384565	They did have at BJ's like a bathtub that you could get a little ducky wearing a witch hat and drink whatever was in it.
7384905	7387949	I wasn't going to pay for that shit, but it was cute.
7387969	7390211	BJ's is one of the spots we go, which is a brewery.
7390252	7392094	Don't get it twisted because it has that name.
7392815	7398141	That is a place that we would go to a lot, but we, yeah.
7398301	7398641	What else?
7398661	7400163	So this is very salted caramel.
7400343	7402586	Oh, like it smells very.
7402606	7403087	Did you eat one?
7403107	7403707	It smells good.
7403888	7405129	I haven't eaten it yet.
7405710	7406691	So I would hate it.
7407700	7411837	Oh, I bet I would love them, but they're probably not within my diet.
7411857	7415913	It's not very strong, but certainly tastes like salt caramel.
7416716	7417660	Oh, then I would hate it.
7419243	7427510	The other thing I will share for my foodie week is there was a day, Friday, that I had pizza for lunch and pizza for dinner.
7428211	7429852	And I didn't intend for it to happen this way.
7429912	7430513	No, it wasn't Friday.
7430533	7431354	It was Thursday.
7431594	7432114	It was Thursday.
7432394	7433335	Pizza for lunch, pizza for dinner.
7433696	7438320	Because I was in the office at work, and one of my coworkers and I agreed to get together.
7438340	7440982	We were working on our little podcast project I talked about at the beginning of the show.
7441002	7443564	I'm hosting it with one of my coworkers.
7444145	7446587	And her and I were like, oh, we're going to have a fun day in the office.
7446627	7448068	We'll go out and get lunch.
7448048	7464522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7464502	7466184	For me, I like Mt.
7466204	7468407	Mike's pizza, and the reason why I like Mt.
7468427	7475095	Mike's pizza is it's like 90% the quality of a Roundtable pizza, but without being that expensive.
7475115	7475956	Like half the price.
7477177	7477958	That's why I like Mt.
7477998	7479140	Mike's.
7479200	7483765	I like how they have the little grease-cut pepperonis, the tiny ones.
7483785	7484666	Those are so good.
7485247	7490053	There is no better pizza than Roundtable as far as chain pizza places go, but it's too expensive now.
7490033	7493197	Well, yeah, it depends on which one you go to as well nowadays.
7493817	7499344	But I don't think that they're necessarily cheaper, though, than Roundtable either.
7499404	7502368	They are still pretty expensive.
7502388	7502528	Sorry.
7502608	7506132	I like the pizza bill that's near me.
7507394	7510497	Sometimes this show does get Sacramento specific because this is our backyard.
7510517	7512259	But I think about Mike's is West Coast, right?
7512480	7514282	They have them in like Arizona, Colorado.
7514302	7515543	It's pretty West Coast.
7515563	7516645	I just don't think they have them back east.
7516905	7517646	Same thing with Roundtable.
7517726	7519568	I think Roundtable is pretty West Coast.
7519548	7522554	Yeah, I had a round table until I moved out here.
7522654	7525420	Of course, you know what the first question I asked was?
7525440	7526482	Where's the Waffle House?
7526663	7527785	Nope, never.
7527925	7528747	Not in this stage.
7529288	7529548	Nope.
7529909	7532815	Hey, I found that out firsthand.
7533065	7534447	So anyway, my pizza story.
7534948	7538994	So we split like a little baby pizza, which is perfect for lunch, just right about a food.
7539014	7539955	And then we do our podcast.
7539975	7544762	And then I come home and I'm like, yeah, Alan, what are you thinking about for dinner tonight?
7544822	7546064	He's like, oh, we're gonna do pizza.
7546825	7550010	Because we get these cauliflower crust pizzas from...
7549990	7550731	Costco.
7550751	7558859	And when he's like, I don't want to do a big to-do meal, he's like, I'm just going to put something in the oven, do a pizza for like a lazy night.
7558879	7559780	And he did.
7559800	7561602	And it was fine because I like this pizza.
7561622	7562283	So at least it was two.
7562303	7562843	Yes.
7562863	7563624	Burr 11 and Chezza.
7563664	7565946	At least it was two different kinds of pizzas.
7565966	7567408	Yes, it was.
7567428	7568649	Yes, it was.
7568950	7572753	Rin Mari talking about local chains saying, we just got a Raising Cane's here lately.
7572834	7573274	I'm sorry.
7573314	7573795	That is the most.
7573815	7575877	And I know I piss some listeners off when I say this.
7575937	7576257	Too bad.
7576517	7577058	What are you going to do?
7577198	7577659	Fire me?
7578059	7578499	I quit.
7578980	7579120	I quit.
7581243	7589785	Raising canes is the most overrated fucking fast food I've never been there that has ever arrived to California overrated
7591537	7595385	I remember, Loki, when you were all about the firehouse or whatever that was.
7595545	7603341	Number one, anything where the key lore to that place is mayonnaise based is a hard no.
7604664	7608431	Number two, the chicken strips are exactly the same as Carl's Jr.
7608411	7609193	's chicken strips.
7610095	7611638	I said what I said.
7611905	7633013	but I will say their french fries do slap that's the one thing and the fact that they serve everything with Texas toast I can get down with Texas toast but it's not something that I think is worth losing your mind over Mike Def says oh go ahead I miss Crystal Crystal?
7633574	7640022	oh the burger place the southern answer to White Castle I seen that in Nashville when I was there yeah yeah
7640305	7644251	Yeah, I wasn't obsessed with any place called Firehouse.
7644792	7651643	I think you may be remembering it's either Von's Chicken, which is the Korean chicken place.
7651684	7652845	They still are around, actually.
7652865	7655470	They opened up more.
7655830	7657693	They went away for a second, then they came back.
7657733	7659697	But yeah, that's still pretty good.
7660518	7664845	And then the other thing I like is the Nashville Hot Chicken stuff, which now...
7665449	7673219	and funny enough, Roostars, which is now Cosmic Roosters in the old Hooters that was over there in Rancho Cordova.
7674641	7678767	But yeah, they've been there for a while now and I think they're pretty good.
7679368	7683513	I used to like, there was this food truck called Nash & Proper.
7684595	7684995	Oh yeah.
7685035	7686617	They're downtown.
7687138	7687238	Yeah.
7687218	7694890	Yeah, they have a place downtown and they have ghost kitchens, but I ordered it through DoorDash or whatever from the ghost kitchen.
7694910	7696031	It was not good.
7696592	7697714	It was not good anymore.
7698555	7700738	National Tender was another kind of knockoff chain.
7700778	7701359	It was also good.
7701640	7706627	They only have one in Lodi now because the Folsom location closed, but yeah, Roostars is pretty good.
7706667	7711875	I think they have multiple locations, but yeah, anyway, the Nashville hot stuff's pretty good.
7711855	7725261	Uh, Pieology's where I've been, or uh, Mod Pizza's where we've been going pretty much weekly now What's that place, what's that place called in Nashville that's like the, somebody in chat's gotta know this, it's like the home of that stuff So, was it Hattie's?
7725281	7727084	Was that the name of it?
7727105	7733577	It's like, they have a big one downtown in that food court Somebody's gotta know Nashville and know what I'm talking about
7733877	7742890	and that was pretty fucking incredible to be honest but a huge line at that place you know what I'm very sad about that's gone?
7745513	7748257	pizza orgasmica oh they're gone?
7749319	7758872	yeah they're gone I haven't thought about them in a while I mean it's been a few years but I loved that baked potato pizza that they had
7760270	7761072	Oh, God.
7761913	7765882	One more comment here from Mike, because we got eight people in the green room right now.
7765982	7766944	So I want to get to that.
7766964	7768928	But where is it?
7769349	7774519	Mike Deft in chat says, I'm Mexican and I loathe American style tacos, but Jack in the Box tacos slap.
7775161	7776844	I think Jack in the Box is- On what planet?
7776824	7779608	I think Jack in the Box is an underrated fast food chain myself.
7779808	7784374	I think I never have a problem because they have such a diverse menu that I never have.
7784394	7788100	And their egg rolls are like the hidden gem on that whole menu.
7788280	7789602	Those egg rolls are a perfect snack.
7789622	7791184	I get sick almost every time I eat there.
7791204	7791905	Oh my God.
7792325	7793307	No, I love Jack in the Box.
7793507	7797673	But I will say as far as now, if you want me to get whoever said Sacramento specific, here you go.
7797693	7805143	Because this is a very controversial opinion because I find people either love or hate and you can put me down and love Jim Boy's Tacos.
7805512	7824668	I fucking love Jim Boy's tacos, but some people can't, like, Seeger can't fucking stand them and says, like, he'd rather eat, I'm pretty sure he said he'd rather eat vomit I like the taste of Jim Boy's tacos, I cannot eat Jim Boy's without being violently ill, every time Yeah, it makes, it does, I don't know, there's something in it that makes people violently ill, I don't know
7824935	7827497	Everything I've eaten at Jim Boyce has made me really sick.
7827758	7830560	Like, Dan took me there the first, when I first moved out here.
7831461	7833483	And I'll just put it this way.
7833503	7836846	I basically, you know, set up an extra bedroom in the bathroom.
7837947	7838788	Oh, no.
7839028	7840850	But, oh, yeah, it was bad.
7840870	7841931	It was bad.
7842131	7842831	I was sick.
7844233	7851860	But we have a place called Felipe's that's out in Citrus Heights, like close to where I used to live.
7852460	7853481	You know, the old Shermie house.
7854262	7854402	Mm-hmm.
7854736	7872643	and um okay it was it was like where that same shopping center that the bingo place is at on greenback i think or auburn but anyway wow yeah um but i'm just trying to put in perspective for local folks um but anyway uh they have the best chicken tacos
7874260	7895695	The Best Chicken Tacos
7895675	7897838	Chondos is delicious, but it also made me sick.
7897858	7900581	And that is another hyper-specific Sacramento thing.
7900601	7903985	Except they had one location in the Buckhead District in Atlanta.
7904946	7905246	I don't know.
7905527	7908791	I think it's something like the cousin lived out in Atlanta and tried to start Chondos out there.
7909391	7919323	I was also sad that they closed a long time ago, but we had a Sharky's up by us, and that had literally the best salsa ever.
7919343	7920385	They had a salsa bard.
7920425	7922047	It was just so good.
7922527	7923168	And then it's gone.
7923528	7924990	And going back...
7924970	7940700	and DarkSakura.com.
7940680	7965540	and not that I'm going to spend any money there but the food is fucking good every time I crave it I get actually when we had that Nash thing that Loki was talking about they do a really good knockoff sandwich that was really good but we don't their their ghost kitchen closed so now I just have McDonald's before I knew better when I lived in Alabama and I worked in the mall
7966330	7980570	Um, my friend worked at the Chick-fil-A, and when I had to pull a 13-hour shift on a Saturday, they would keep the, um, the hash brown, the little hash brown nuggets, um, thawed out for me, just for me.
7980590	7984455	Because I would get my chicken nuggets and my hash brown nuggets.
7984475	7991545	So, so, but I, yeah, I won't spend money there now, but I just want to say that, you know, people...
7991930	7993673	If you truly don't like it, that's fine.
7993713	8000343	But there are a lot of people out there who will say, oh, I don't like that thing when they're boycotting it for some sort of political or social reason.
8000964	8009297	And the thing is, is that you can say, yeah, I actually like the food or I like the product, but I don't like the company, so I'm going to do without.
8009969	8012032	That's kind of how I feel about Target.
8012172	8015597	I used to love going there because we used to go to dinner and then we'd go to Target for no reason.
8015897	8020884	Did you hear about that shit about them saying you have to smile and make eye contact?
8021124	8021645	Fuck no.
8021665	8023207	That's a reason for me not to go.
8023287	8024989	It's so misguided.
8025009	8030256	I would like to mention along the lines of that that they force them to do this.
8030637	8031778	It's always awkward.
8032019	8033901	I hate that they have to do this.
8034252	8034973	Burger King.
8035393	8038698	Every time that they greet you at Burger King, they have to tell you, you rule.
8041622	8043164	I don't need a Burger King.
8043184	8044806	I didn't know that.
8044886	8045907	That's terrible.
8047349	8053577	Well, I actually kind of inherited a vendetta against Burger King thanks to Becky.
8055481	8062256	Um, the only thing I ever liked there was their, uh, their onion rings and sometimes I could get Surge.
8062276	8065323	I don't think there's anything I like at Burger King.
8065343	8066405	Yeah, I will, I will.
8066425	8067548	I always go for the breakfast sandwiches.
8067628	8069011	That's it.
8069031	8070574	I just don't eat fast food.
8070594	8071436	That's the thing.
8071476	8073220	I mean, sometimes I do.
8073368	8093942	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says but I do rule yes you do Bobby you do but like it's just it's so like like just don't make your employees do it you're like barely paying them like it's not gonna make the customer go wow I rule oh wow I feel so special now I'm gonna keep coming back here like it it really it's just it's so gross it's just all right cringy yeah
8093922	8097090	Alright, we've got like nine people in the green room.
8097110	8098013	I want to get two calls.
8098393	8099115	But there you go.
8099516	8100399	Food discussion.
8100679	8101842	Ample food discussion.
8101923	8104469	Taking over the final episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
8104489	8108078	Thank you for being patient with us and I hope some of it was worth the wait.
8108098	8110665	Now we can think about a different point, Radim, for the channel.
8110645	8114912	Anyway, okay, we are going to be going to listener final thoughts.
8115012	8117355	We have emails, we have videos, we have calls.
8117375	8127451	So because we have so much tonight, I am going to ask our listeners, when I pull you into the You Are Next room, if you could make sure your camera is on if you want it to be on.
8127471	8129254	You don't have to be on camera if you don't want to.
8130376	8131978	So that way when I pull you
8131958	8134921	Okay, and if I put you in that you are next room, stay in there.
8135982	8137163	Otherwise, I'm pulling someone else in there.
8137723	8141007	So turn your camera on, and then I will pull you in on the air.
8141487	8144250	And then if you don't want to be on cam, that's fine.
8144270	8144830	You don't have to.
8145351	8146772	Oh, do cameras turn off when you change rooms?
8146792	8147553	That's good to know, Bobby.
8147593	8149455	Then try to turn it on right away.
8149475	8154019	I am going to be limiting calls to like two to three minutes tonight, just because we have a lot to get through.
8154039	8155240	So I hope you'll bear with us, okay?
8155580	8156321	And we have emails.
8156601	8158303	Whatever you want to say.
8158283	8167878	We love you all for being here, but I would ask you to just be succinct and get to the point type of thing, okay?
8168279	8169921	We have nine emails, by the way.
8170422	8171604	Are you fucking serious?
8172565	8173106	Oh my God.
8173266	8174368	All right, here we go.
8174388	8175049	Did I joke?
8175069	8176712	No, but I just, all right, here we go.
8177733	8178895	We're going to get to our first caller.
8178955	8181299	Hi there, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8181319	8182080	Who's this?
8184811	8186113	You are muted, my friend.
8186133	8187295	You gotta hit that mute button.
8187315	8188457	It is so good to see you, though.
8190601	8192124	I am still not hearing you.
8195910	8197272	Nope, still don't hear you.
8197293	8198274	So why do y'all do me a favor?
8198314	8208051	I'm gonna put you, Zaku, I'm gonna put you back in the lobby so you can test with the people in there, and then I'm gonna get to the next call, and then we will...
8208622	8212265	Real quick, I'm just going to read a message that came from Dan, which he won't come in here and say himself.
8212445	8212706	Okay.
8213606	8216329	Congratulations, OLR, on a wonderful run.
8216349	8218451	Good luck with whatever you decide to do with the future.
8218551	8219351	Hearts.
8219371	8220172	Oh, that's very kind.
8220613	8221153	I appreciate that.
8221413	8221814	Thanks, Dan.
8222454	8223775	Dan!
8223795	8225016	Dan, I said thank you!
8225797	8226298	And coffee.
8227379	8229120	And coffee!
8229140	8229901	Alright.
8229921	8231943	Let's get to our next call.
8232023	8233764	Hello, you are on Orange Lawns Radio.
8233804	8237007	Who's this?
8237027	8238088	I like vodka.
8238659	8240002	Hi Grandpa, how are you?
8241004	8242507	I'm doing special, how are you?
8242828	8244431	I am doing fantastic.
8244451	8247197	I'm assuming you're not wearing pants and that's why you're not on cam tonight.
8248460	8256237	Yes, and I feel and look like shit because I got really, really drunk yesterday and I didn't shower today.
8256257	8256718	You have hangover boys.
8256738	8256938	I'm sorry.
8257441	8260565	and I have Hangover Voice and I've got a pussy on my lap.
8260585	8264189	Well, thank you for the presence that you sent.
8264209	8265911	You're not SSJ100, Matt.
8265951	8267173	Thank you for the presence that you sent.
8267333	8270537	I do appreciate it, even if my doctor does not.
8270557	8273220	Well, you know, it's all about moderation, Robbie Kins.
8273340	8274101	It's about moderation.
8274602	8276204	Well, now I know what I'll bring to Friendsgiving.
8276765	8278967	Honestly, that works too.
8279127	8285355	I just wanted to call in and say I really like the show and I'm looking forward to next week's topics.
8286044	8291131	Well, I'm sorry to say, but we're passing away after tonight.
8291712	8292933	What?
8292953	8293915	You guys are so good.
8293935	8298101	I think there's a niche for this type of podcast about video games.
8298121	8302066	You guys should do this on a weekly basis and see what happens.
8302286	8302747	You know what?
8302927	8304209	That is a great idea.
8304489	8308715	And I would point you to a podcast called GameBooey.org because they'll be live next week.
8308735	8310938	Not live, but they'll have a show next week.
8310958	8312640	Do you know of any Star Trek podcasts?
8312841	8313722	I really like Star Trek.
8313882	8314703	Not any good ones.
8315124	8315224	Yeah.
8315525	8316767	Okay, thank you for that.
8319031	8323479	No, I just, look, I've told you Rob many times, even after you broke my heart all those years ago.
8324080	8325883	I give you a lot of shit.
8326424	8331913	I give you a lot of shit, and you deserve about three quarters of it, but I distinctly remember...
8332687	8334811	It might have been a date we were on or whatever.
8334831	8336173	He said, come on over to my house.
8336353	8337876	I won't say the city.
8337896	8339779	I do this thing called a podcast.
8339799	8341081	I don't live there anymore, to be fair.
8341421	8342303	That's fair.
8342684	8343445	It was in a garage.
8343585	8344447	It wasn't insulated.
8344607	8345328	I was cold.
8346330	8354764	And you helped me start to really appreciate my own nerdiness that I was never proud to have.
8356246	8357428	So thank you for like
8357746	8358993	Help me motivate that.
8359013	8359938	This is actually kind of fun.
8360019	8361568	I think I could do this.
8361588	8362272	I mean, look at Rob.
8362312	8363800	If he can do it, anyone can do this, right?
8364263	8364685	But
8365390	8367273	I really appreciate that.
8367293	8373885	And of course, I've told you and our groups of friends that I started dating you when I was emerging from the closet.
8373905	8377250	You gave me a lot of confidence to come out and do all that too.
8377351	8379434	So you're always in my heart for that.
8379875	8385304	So I will be serious for once in front of your fans and your co-hosts.
8385324	8386406	Jamie, you are a hoot.
8386787	8390453	You make me laugh every single time, even when you're eating penis cookies.
8390433	8418685	You are a hoot That was your fault That was my fault, I bought that, that's for sure We're never changing the shower Matt, I want to mention I think once or twice in person but you always have the deadpan straight man humor that I deeply appreciate because if I wasn't drunk on Horde House that actually would have been my type of sense of humor so thank you from one Matt to another for having that stalwart
8419677	8422361	Even Kiel, just delivery.
8422501	8423843	And I love it.
8423863	8427047	So thank you for being consistent.
8427107	8431934	But I'd like to announce preemptively before Rob hangs up on me.
8432575	8435659	Horde House 2 The Second Coming is going to be happening.
8435679	8437301	That's one of his unannounced projects.
8437321	8438223	Not The Second Coming.
8440065	8443610	It's one of his unannounced podcasts that's coming.
8444091	8445853	So be on the lookout for that.
8446070	8475250	and before I round out not to make it depressing or sad on a sad note but again all my best to you guys I do want to call out the Starboard Power Coupling podcast that the Starboard Power Coupling finally did fail but it did fail but I do want to call out a podcaster that's no longer with us from my show who lost his battle with cancer just a little over a year ago and I think it's worth noting there's a lot of good content creators a lot of good people out there that we've lost in the
8475719	8486539	Rob on HordeHouse
8487008	8489290	Yeah, may his memory be a blessing.
8489891	8490372	Absolutely.
8490392	8490832	Thank you.
8490992	8492234	Thank you for bringing that up.
8492254	8496278	I absolutely want to give a shout out to Lieutenant Commander Eddie.
8497079	8498821	And we have lost members of the O.L.
8498881	8501784	Army, sadly, over these few years.
8501824	8503365	And I'm afraid I would leave somebody out.
8503385	8504587	And we've lost people.
8504607	8506729	But yeah, we've lost people in our personal lives as well.
8506749	8509432	So it's, yeah.
8510313	8511314	Thank you for bringing that up.
8511334	8514197	I think that is important to show that, you know...
8514177	8519604	There's a little piece of you in our hearts and I appreciate it.
8519684	8520365	Even you, Grandpa.
8522127	8523028	Thanks, bitch.
8523168	8530798	I look forward to seeing you next week and we can party on the cruise and I'll bug you about when are you bringing back the Starboard Power Coupling podcast.
8530818	8531538	But you know what?
8531819	8536865	If you're doing Horde House The Second Coming, I think that's the fucking best name ever and I actually hope you do it.
8536945	8537926	I hope that wasn't a joke.
8538868	8540910	I still have my...
8541515	8542837	My WoW characters.
8542897	8545040	I think that's the end of the WoW account, so I can go right back.
8546302	8548284	Do you remember my monk's name?
8550267	8551489	It was probably racist.
8551669	8551990	I don't know.
8552030	8553391	It was racist.
8553411	8554433	Then don't say it now.
8554673	8555554	Don't say it now.
8555955	8556496	No, I won't.
8556516	8558579	Why don't you say goodnight, Rob, Jamie, and Matt.
8558599	8559019	Goodnight.
8560061	8561803	Goodnight, you amazing people.
8561923	8562784	All the best to you.
8562865	8567271	Congrats on 23 years and hearts and kisses, especially Robbie Kins.
8567291	8567992	Alright, thanks, bitch.
8568112	8568973	Goodnight.
8569156	8598792	Bye, bitches!
8599396	8606067	and 23 years of you being here with us.
8606087	8615763	And again, like I said last week, I'm really thankful for you and for being part of my life for pretty much almost half my life.
8616945	8617827	I'm 43 now.
8617867	8619750	I recently turned 43.
8620574	8626081	and you basically have been like half of my life here.
8626101	8628144	So it's like- Half of our lives too.
8628164	8628965	Half of our lives too.
8629325	8633370	So yeah, it's, you know, and again, this was by no means an easy decision.
8633390	8635133	A little less than half of mine, but yeah.
8635433	8642602	It was by no means an easy decision, but as difficult as it is, I know it's the right one in many ways.
8642622	8650412	And, you know, we will continue to the future and whatever may be in store for us next.
8650392	8662140	so well most of all I also and something you said earlier on the show it's that you inspired a lot of us to create our own stuff
8662542	8672073	And again, I was talking about last week, mostly of my own podcast, GFM Cast, which sadly had to end.
8672774	8681344	But there's also a lot of projects I worked on with you personally on OLR and also VOG, where I love that song.
8681785	8688533	I also wrote game reviews, and I think I wrote one or two movie reviews, too.
8689542	8715499	but yeah that's also a lot of things I worked on and who knows maybe I will work on something in the future I do have some ideas to get back to something like I love that music I love that song maybe in like shorts or in that short media form maybe love it
8715850	8743478	but yeah, I'm gonna see if I can work something out and how I can work it out you introduced me to Aurelio Voltaire before I got to introduce him twice on stage here in Sacramento I actually found out about his music through your articles so it's funny how the world works sometimes yeah, definitely it's like really how that works, like really funny how all that works in some ways but
8743795	8759601	But yeah, again, I want to work on something like that to promote or at least make things that maybe people haven't heard or haven't noticed and bring it up to light so everyone can enjoy.
8759641	8761083	So yeah.
8761704	8763627	But again, I'm thankful.
8763910	8766593	And again, it's not a goodbye.
8767073	8767534	That's right.
8767654	8770917	It's not, yeah, it's not, oh, this is all ending.
8771198	8776163	We're going to see each other in blue sky or discord or whatever.
8777004	8778846	And it's like not the end.
8778866	8788416	But again, it is going to be like weird, at least for a while, to not have all our on Sundays.
8789425	8792152	Well, you never know what the future might have in store.
8792613	8800312	And I would say, I look forward to collaborating with you on future stuff and still having you in the VOG family.
8800332	8801154	I'm thankful for that too.
8801555	8802397	All right.
8802638	8803280	Take care, Deft.
8803540	8804142	Until next time.
8804442	8805285	Thank you so much for the call.
8805545	8805806	All right.
8805926	8806227	Bye, buddy.
8806247	8806708	Thanks.
8807853	8810298	All right, let's get to our next call.
8810318	8814747	We're going to try going back to the first person that called in and see if the audio is... Hi, you're on Orange Isles Radio.
8814767	8815649	Let's try this again.
8815689	8816831	We got you loud and clear.
8817132	8818314	Who is this?
8818435	8819597	Okay.
8819617	8819697	Hey.
8819717	8820158	What's up?
8821454	8823216	All right, hopefully this time it works, yeah?
8823457	8824298	It does, long time.
8825079	8825720	What's on your mind, buddy?
8825740	8838096	Yeah, I know, it's been 20, well, for me it's been like, what, since 2004, so it's like, what, hey, I'm already old enough to drink since I first heard you guys.
8838116	8839498	Exactly what I'm doing right now.
8839658	8841100	Yeah, I know, our show's old enough to drink.
8841120	8841781	That makes two of us.
8841801	8843043	Our show's old enough to rent a car.
8844725	8846247	But yeah, it's like a lot...
8847037	8865653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8866274	8869840	Yes, that's what age does.
8870321	8878013	Oh my god, I just remember the Skype days when it was like jet black, but you know what, my hair used to be bright red, so yeah.
8878033	8881499	Yeah, now it's like, yeah, that's what happens when you age, you know?
8881920	8883022	I'm an eternal redhead.
8883883	8884624	Thank you, L'Oreal.
8884865	8893058	I gotta keep the call short tonight because we have a lot of people to get through, Zaku, but is there anything, well, what do you want to say here on the final show?
8893696	8895298	Thank you.
8895358	8896480	Thank you.
8912923	8920834	Thank you.
8920814	8925576	You've definitely, I mean, the fact that you have the Guinness World Record in there.
8926012	8931699	And the fact that you probably could hold on to that until some other show decides to do more than 23 years.
8932841	8940370	I have a feeling there's another show that cannot wait to claim that title, but it's fine.
8940931	8941412	You know what?
8942213	8945637	Because there's a lot of hardworking indie podcasters out there, and it's all good.
8945697	8949342	But at this point in time, it was us.
8949362	8953167	And we did something nobody else did at this point in time.
8953727	8954989	And, you know...
8956589	8956849	Yeah.
8957952	8975003	Yeah.
8975438	8976579	as well.
8976659	8977360	It goes both ways.
8977380	8980543	I wouldn't have known Ranma S, Adam.
8980603	8982124	I wouldn't have known him without you guys.
8983285	8986208	Neither would I. He's the best guy.
8986348	8986748	Yeah, I know.
8986768	8987909	He's a close friend of mine.
8988570	8991492	Going from the DDR days to still kind of playing.
8992273	8995116	Every now and then, a lot of my friends still play heavily.
8995156	8997198	They're all in the tournament scene.
8997338	9005445	A lot of the friends that I made through that, through OLR, that kind of did help me get through college and beyond.
9005425	9033002	and now looking back at things you definitely did a good run 23 years at least you're not the Simpsons which is going to push 40 at some point you finally got out Ranma says he's going to be your best man at upcoming wedding, that's incredible I'm going to do podcasts until I'm 100 yes, that is happening in the next less than a year and a half from now in the Bronx Zoo so
9033134	9037491	I have to shell out 40, you know, it's a 40 grand expense, but...
9038517	9039619	Yeah, for a zoo wedding.
9040179	9041581	Hey, it's going to be beautiful and memorable.
9042102	9045046	Zaku, thank you so much for being here and tonight.
9045126	9047590	And thank you for the impact you've had on the show over the years.
9047610	9052657	It's always been your calls have been a highlight of the show for quite some time.
9052677	9055942	And even if we haven't heard him in a while, but I just, yeah.
9055962	9057224	I came back for this.
9057244	9058245	Well, I appreciate it.
9058265	9059327	And thank you for spending your time with us.
9059347	9060608	Thank you for choosing to hang out with us.
9060789	9061430	We appreciate it.
9061570	9061890	Oh, yeah.
9062331	9063833	Mazel tov on your upcoming wedding.
9064420	9064861	Thank you.
9064881	9065664	Congratulations.
9065684	9066226	Good luck.
9066647	9068432	And hang in a hundred years.
9068453	9068794	All right.
9068854	9069355	Take care, buddy.
9070519	9071061	Bye.
9071081	9072084	Bye.
9072104	9072505	All right.
9072545	9074150	Let's get to our next call.
9074251	9074752	Hello.
9074772	9075876	You are on Orange Haunts Radio.
9075896	9076658	Who's this?
9077768	9080792	I don't know, it's some blind guy or something.
9081774	9082575	Sterlok, yeah.
9082835	9085760	Sterlok, it is so good to hear from you.
9086100	9088424	And I finally got to meet you recently.
9088444	9090467	My fellow Death Star drinker.
9090567	9093932	Yes, I hope they have it next time we go.
9094012	9095915	I'm sad that Rob didn't get to try the Death Star.
9096335	9097577	I know, you would have liked it.
9097637	9100461	It was good.
9100481	9101483	Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9102725	9106290	Well, just, man, just...
9107890	9114178	I guess really just to reflect on the show and how long I've been a part of it.
9116121	9135906	I started back in around 2006, 2007 through All Games, which I found out about, I mentioned this last year, through my friend Brandon, who unfortunately passed away last year, but he was a fellow blind gamer like me.
9137405	9149432	And he got on the show, and I was like, whoa, an entire radio network for video games?
9149913	9153220	Sure, yeah, I'll listen to the other shows here.
9154128	9158273	I became a fan of Bobby and you guys in particular.
9159275	9165062	Well, it's been great to have you here, Sherlock, and I really appreciate your perspective as well.
9167145	9179221	Hearing from somebody who is such a fan of video games but also has to deal with being blind, being differently abled than other folks, and how you kind of see your way through video games.
9179421	9180823	Sorry, I realize that's an ironic statement.
9181384	9184067	I do it all the time, so don't worry about it.
9184047	9210966	but you know I just I really appreciate that perspective because it also really emphasizes the importance of accessibility in games and that's a topic that we've heard about more and more in the last 10 years and I really I really feel like that's like so like something that you've been able to champion here on this show and help use this platform to do that and so I just yeah I really appreciate what you've been able to do for that and I'd like to think you have again you're gonna really need to forgive the pun open people's eyes to this
9210946	9213209	I know you would laugh at it.
9213249	9213829	Not everybody would.
9213849	9214811	I know you'll laugh at it.
9214831	9217674	But to the different perspectives, I really, really appreciate it.
9217854	9219236	Sterlux played DBD with me.
9219696	9220037	I have.
9220517	9221839	I got to a generator.
9222520	9223981	And did a skill check.
9224001	9224502	Oh, that's right.
9224602	9224962	He did.
9224982	9225964	Did I pass the skill check?
9225984	9226785	I think I did.
9226925	9229227	You passed the skill check, but then you got grabbed.
9229488	9230008	Yeah.
9230028	9230209	Yeah.
9230229	9231830	We're going to have to do that again.
9232331	9235755	No, it's been amazing because, like, I mean –
9236410	9242295	I never thought Jamie and I would become as good friends as we are, you know?
9242315	9245087	Because, you know, you listen to a podcast and you're like, yeah, whatever, you know?
9245557	9246559	I'm never going to meet these people.
9247200	9249904	No, Jamie and I are like super good friends.
9249944	9253049	We've met each other twice now and we're going to meet a third time here in a few weeks.
9253149	9255193	I have many great friends because of OLR.
9255413	9260541	And I kind of go back to what I said to Zaku is that you all impact us.
9260561	9264467	It is – and I have some of this – my final thoughts are like 15 minutes long.
9264568	9267953	But there's a piece in there that talks about that –
9269013	9298615	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9299523	9303350	Especially really in the AI space of all things.
9303370	9310403	AI has actually given us, thanks to the modding scene, some accessible experiences.
9310603	9311665	Interesting.
9313128	9315552	Many of them this year alone.
9316373	9317235	Hades 2.
9317435	9321843	We've had Hades 1 accessible for quite some time now.
9322885	9323927	Disco Elysium.
9325038	9352598	Terraria and the big ones for me especially Final Fantasy 6 and 9 which are both ongoing but you still need to stream those I do I do need to stream them yes and DarkSakura you said it in chat this is what assistive AI is good for yeah AI isn't necessarily evil and I think a lot of us you know in a certain realm politically need to need to really push back some of the perceptions that all AI is bad
9352578	9355905	I do understand the environmental impact and such.
9356547	9358411	People think in absolutes.
9358511	9359413	Exactly.
9359574	9364004	And again, I've said this over and over and I still feel this way.
9364024	9368173	AI is a tool, not a replacement tool.
9368153	9369315	Especially when it comes to art.
9369555	9372360	AI is not a replacement for art, but AI can be a tool.
9372781	9379353	And if that tool is helping folks with accessibility and helping, I think there can be a good thing in that space.
9379413	9382679	And I'm thankful for AI and where technology is going.
9383380	9390212	I couldn't imagine even a year ago, if I had told Brandon, hey man, in a year we're going to be playing...
9391154	9392595	Two Final Fantasy games.
9392635	9393917	He would have been like, what?
9395338	9400082	And he was even more of a champion for accessibility than I was.
9400462	9401784	So he lived it.
9401824	9404386	That was his job for years.
9405467	9406708	It's pretty crazy.
9407109	9410792	I gotta let you go to get to these other calls, but I appreciate your perspective so much.
9410852	9414555	And I hope you have a great whatever the future holds for you.
9414736	9416537	And I know I'll see you again.
9416918	9418579	See you soon!
9418559	9419320	Yeah, absolutely.

9422683	9424345	Bye-bye.
9424365	9424745	All right.

9426146	9426547	Hello.
9426647	9428088	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
9428108	9428529	Who's this?
9432353	9434034	That's a... Hello.
9434254	9435135	Hey, how's it going?
9436677	9437958	It's Fantaz.
9437978	9439039	Fantaz.
9439179	9439460	Hi.
9439620	9441421	What's up, buddy?
9441442	9442903	Greetings from Canada.
9443363	9444585	First time calling in.
9444965	9445866	Well, what a night.
9445946	9447047	I call in...
9447263	9448425	Where in Canada?
9451049	9451690	Where in Canada?
9453152	9453653	Toronto.
9453673	9457499	I have some sister friends in Toronto.
9457539	9460644	I've never been to Toronto, but my husband has and he wants to go back.
9460664	9461566	So I think we will sometime.
9461766	9465712	That's audio from my phone.
9465752	9467014	I'm just figuring that out.
9467736	9469879	And I'm getting echoes from my headphones.
9470281	9496879	I used to watch you guys a lot I found out on Rob's Instagram that OLR was ended so I popped in here
9497467	9523002	I used to watch you guys a lot back in the All Games days with the other shows on there but not at all recently like all the way back to 98 or something like that like I started when I was really really young and it's pretty wild how you guys won the Guinness record for the longest running English video game podcast and like screw those other guys
9524450	9525431	I'm really tired.
9525512	9529598	I went on a two-day bender Friday, Saturday, so I look like shit.
9529938	9530919	Turn off my webcam.
9530939	9532582	You're fine.
9532962	9539412	Well, hey, I appreciate your first call being in on such a monumentous episode, and I appreciate those types of memories back to all games.
9540153	9543157	Yeah, that was an important part of our growth in that collaboration.
9543898	9544900	Hello back at you.
9545020	9546943	Anything else you want to share with the audience before we let you go tonight?
9548024	9548645	Alright, yeah.
9548665	9550949	I didn't prepare at all, so I wasn't sure what to say.
9551109	9553933	I'm just really another video game tech fan on the internet.
9554707	9557652	We've been around a long time, so just pop and say hi.
9557932	9559815	You've really been a big inspiration to me.
9560296	9560597	Thank you.
9560617	9562099	That really does mean a lot.
9562199	9563962	And thank you for taking the time to call in tonight.
9564082	9570132	And thank you for coming back after, you know, we understand not everybody can stay with us for 23 years consistently.
9570152	9571534	So thank you for coming back to say hello.
9571935	9575280	But with that, I'm going to put you in the sobriety tank with Grandpa, okay?
9576362	9577764	You mean I could have taken a break?
9578285	9578486	All right.
9578526	9579347	Take care, buddy.
9579985	9580586	Take care.
9580626	9581567	Come to Canada.
9581807	9582128	I will.
9582188	9583109	Come try a poutine.
9583389	9583870	I will.
9584410	9585472	Stay tuned to my Instagram.
9585512	9585892	I will.
9585912	9586132	All right.
9586153	9586573	Take care, buddy.
9586893	9587955	Absolutely.
9587975	9588235	Bye.
9589256	9589577	All right.
9589617	9590498	Love that.
9590538	9591539	Let's go to our next caller.
9591599	9592680	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9592700	9593061	Who's this?
9596946	9598467	Hey, this is Brad from PodCulture.
9598608	9601291	Well, hello, Brad from PodCulture.
9601471	9602532	How you doing?
9602593	9603393	Hi, Brad.
9604435	9606297	I'm on Discord and I kind of know how to use it.
9607036	9613430	I know you were so pissed when we left Skype, but joke's on you, Skype's done now.
9614372	9615454	There is no Skype.
9618120	9624454	I get used to my routines and I just hate changing them.
9624805	9625566	I get it.
9626527	9627188	That part.
9627669	9628390	That part.
9628410	9631394	But sometimes we have to force ourselves to change a little bit.
9631815	9633958	And so it is what it is.
9633978	9636802	Yes, Slaggy, Skype did finally die.
9636822	9638304	Oh my god, you're wearing this shirt!
9638465	9643011	Hold on, and I'm gonna fix the camera thing here to get this to work right.
9643071	9644834	Oh, you're wearing one of DarkSakura's streaming shirts.
9644854	9645354	It's really cute.
9645374	9646476	Oh yeah, how about it?
9646793	9650497	Oh, I love it.
9650517	9651918	I'm so proud of those two.
9652018	9656322	Thank you for modeling my neon Sakura shirt.
9656403	9657564	It actually looks like a nice quality.
9658625	9662589	It is, but if you want to order one, order up a size or two.
9662609	9663570	It runs a little small.
9663910	9665471	Okay, good to know.
9665491	9668354	Well, what did you want to talk about here at the end?
9668815	9669676	Anything on your mind tonight?
9670556	9676142	No, I just wanted to call and say thanks for 20-odd years of
9676392	9687448	Sunday Night Entertainment you're welcome if it hadn't been for you guys I wouldn't have done my show so thank you
9688188	9692016	Well, I was going to raise a toast, but I got a little nervous, so never mind on that.
9692036	9692877	You drank it.
9692897	9693418	It's okay.
9693779	9694280	You know what we'll do.
9694601	9696004	There, that's all right.
9697006	9698088	Well, that was what was left.
9698749	9699270	I don't know.
9699430	9703458	I don't know if Ranma's planning on jumping in at some time, but I'm sure he'd say something along the line.
9703498	9704080	Here's to you.
9704200	9704861	Here's to me.
9705302	9706885	Best of friends will always be.
9707346	9708829	But if we should ever disagree.
9708809	9738580	Fuck you and here's to me
9739100	9744448	Well, Brad, I know this is not the end of our collaboration, and I will sue you again in the future.
9744629	9745790	That's all I'm going to say about that.
9746271	9748455	But thank you.
9748575	9749516	Thank you for being along for the ride.
9749536	9757008	You've been here for a very long time, and I appreciate getting to meet you at DragonCon a couple of times, and I'm sure I will see you again in the future.
9757028	9757629	All righty.
9757649	9758911	Well, you guys have a good show.
9759091	9759452	All right.
9760133	9760513	You too.
9760654	9761154	Take care, buddy.
9761535	9761815	All right.
9761996	9762897	Bye-bye.
9763113	9765156	Alright, let's get to our next call.
9765196	9766499	We have a few more to get through here.
9766559	9769063	Hi, but I'm loving hearing from all these people.
9769083	9770025	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9770045	9770385	Who's this?
9774272	9776055	Hey, you gotta mute on Discord.
9776075	9776956	Hi, this is Orange Right.
9776996	9778118	Hey, Orange Right!
9779043	9782127	I guess everyone has that problem, I guess.
9782227	9785371	It's been a while since I've done this kind of Discord call.
9785391	9791359	We go like six months with no Discord calls, and then everybody wants to call in the same night for one reason, so everybody's testing it now.
9791379	9791879	Yeah, I know.
9791899	9792480	It's fine, it's fine.
9792800	9793381	What's up, buddy?
9794463	9799549	So, I just wanted to say congratulations on such a great run.
9800238	9803604	I couldn't even believe how long I've been listening.
9803704	9812659	The first time I realized how long I was listening was when I was editing the listless page on the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki.
9813721	9816326	Thank you for the work on the Wiki, by the way.
9816386	9817027	Thank you, thank you.
9817407	9818650	Thank you very much.
9818670	9820052	You're welcome.
9820657	9822640	I'm already messing up already.
9822660	9833478	So, I was editing the list lists on the wiki page, and one of the ones I remembered listening to was the worst song in DDR that has not let them move.
9835121	9837965	And I didn't know what it was, but I knew that was one of them.
9838025	9842412	So I put that in, I put number signs, question mark, question mark, question mark.
9843394	9844656	Turned out to be episode four.
9845395	9861278	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9861410	9888615	I don't know
9888747	9889889	Let me check.
9890169	9896521	I mean, to be fair, that was also early on in DDR's history, so the answer maybe has changed.
9897142	9900548	That's probably plenty of songs that are worse than Let Them Move Now.
9900568	9906418	God, yeah, there's plenty of songs that are pretty bad now at this point, but...
9906533	9908776	Immortal King thinks it was Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
9908836	9911639	We used to razz the hell out of that song.
9912440	9915163	Well, all of their... Get a new song!
9915203	9917626	Get a new song, bitch!
9918527	9921110	So, number three, Let the Beat Hit Him by Stone Bros.
9921350	9922372	Oh, that is a bad song.
9922492	9922772	Okay.
9924174	9928338	Two, Beul by Team, which is a song from... Oh, God!
9928359	9929480	That's a deep cut.
9929520	9932523	Okay, that's a... No, but that's a third mix Korean.
9932644	9933064	Yeah.
9933449	9936352	Yeah, and number one was that guy got it correct.
9936552	9938073	Bye Bye Baby Balloon by Joga.
9938093	9938574	All right.
9938594	9940275	Oh, but Mortal King gets this gold star.
9940335	9940896	There it is.
9940916	9941376	All right.
9941396	9943018	Bye Bye Baby Balloon.
9943278	9944619	I love that.
9944679	9945740	All right.
9945760	9946861	Orange, anything else you want to say?
9946881	9948703	And thank you again for all your work on the wiki behind the scenes.
9948863	9949403	Appreciate it.
9949463	9952206	And it's the part of the show with this and the archive.
9952586	9954328	The show isn't being deleted.
9954348	9956250	So there's still lots of stuff to do.
9956330	9963456	As you and Matt, I think, put on social media, there is more hours of this show than Saturday Night Live.
9963436	9966881	I think was the stat that he pulled somewhere.
9966901	9967803	Isn't that wild?
9967823	9968244	I know.
9968264	9968524	I know.
9969005	9975795	So I guess I guess like, yeah, well, how long is I don't even know how long on top of my head, I guess.
9975815	9977578	90 minutes.
9977598	9983848	So and a lot of episodes of this show have been three hours, especially in the early days was three hours, maybe more recently, two hours.
9983968	9985330	But yeah, still a lot.
9985510	9987413	So.
9987433	9987734	All right.
9988155	9989697	Anything else, Orange, right before I let you go?
9990622	10009238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10009218	10012142	Now, thank you for being a part of my Sunday nights.
10012162	10013384	Well, thank you for being here.
10013484	10016648	You've always had very insightful chat comments, and I really appreciate it.
10017189	10018711	And best of luck with your streaming.
10018731	10022075	I know you're a streamer, and I just want to wish you the best of luck with all that in the future.
10023877	10024298	Well, thank you.
10024518	10025500	You are most welcome.
10025520	10026301	All right, take care, my friend.
10027222	10027622	All right, bye.
10027903	10028343	Bye.
10028483	10035353	All right, I totally forgot to pull somebody into the You Are Next room, so this person is going to get caught a little off guard probably, but let's get to it.
10035733	10037235	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
10037255	10037976	Who's this?
10042327	10043390	There we go.
10043410	10044454	Hi, I can.
10044494	10046018	Hi, who is this?
10046480	10047784	Hi, this is Garth the Wolf.
10047804	10049429	Hey, Garth Wolf, how are you?
10050953	10051375	Pretty good.
10051495	10055728	I just wanted to call in and say I had Raising Cane's last night and it was delicious.
10056181	10056902	Thank you very much.
10057182	10057563	Fuck off.
10057583	10061327	I don't give a shit.
10061347	10061548	All right.
10061568	10062128	I'm happy for you.
10062148	10062689	No, no, no.
10062709	10066634	On a real note, I just want to say thank you guys for the years and years of this show.
10066874	10071640	I've been listening since I discovered back on DDR Freak.
10071680	10077247	I saw a vivid post by Sky, and I see the flashing photo.
10077267	10078408	I'm like, ooh, they're important.
10078568	10079629	So I'm like, what's this show?
10079649	10080130	And then...
10080110	10081371	Ooh, they're important.
10081472	10091183	No, I just, I guess the official determination was because we had new DDR songs that we were playing on show.
10091203	10092765	Now we were officially tied to it.
10092785	10094787	And that's why I got a vivid foot.
10095268	10095548	Yeah.
10095568	10095668	Yeah.
10095688	10097130	Yeah.
10097150	10098031	DarkSakura was a mod.
10098051	10098792	She had a green foot.
10098912	10099633	I was a mod.
10100554	10101776	I do remember seeing that.
10101796	10102016	Yeah.
10102356	10105560	I did a couple of very controversial bands too.
10107160	10107542	Spicy.
10109088	10111578	Garth, how old were you when you started listening to OLR?
10111699	10117322	I swear to God, you were like 17 years old when you started listening to this show, and now I'm looking at you and I'm like...
10117403	10118324	That's a man!
10118585	10122892	Like, that's... You're not... You were, like, 17, and now you're, like, all grown up.
10123152	10123973	My God.
10124194	10124955	Which tracks.
10124975	10127659	You should be... You should be in your late 30s at this point.
10128260	10128480	Right?
10128500	10128661	Mid-30s?
10128681	10129522	It might have been middle school.
10130544	10132006	Jesus Christ.
10132687	10137114	So, no, you're... Because, yeah, I was like, wait, you're, like, low to mid-30s, but you've been listening for, like, 20 years.
10138296	10138516	Yeah.
10139377	10140059	Oh, my God.
10140079	10142923	No, it's been a minute, but I've... I've really enjoyed it.
10144405	10145487	I was one of the...
10146530	10167964	Thank you for being here all these years.
10168754	10169535	I really appreciate it.
10169555	10172919	There is no greater compliment than something like that.
10173139	10175142	So you're welcome.
10175202	10181269	And I'm so happy to see you thriving and still here for this last episode and coming into your own in so many ways.
10181289	10186956	You've taught me a lot about, you know, certain communities and things that you hang out with and have come on shows and stuff.
10187137	10190321	And oh, I got the I got the please hold sign.
10190701	10193485	And there it is a new furry mask there.
10193505	10194906	Is that your latest outfit?
10194986	10195487	I love it.
10195973	10197636	Yeah, this is my main character, Garth.
10198938	10199820	Resident furry here.
10200781	10203726	Well, I'm sure this isn't the first time you've heard this, but party on, Garth.
10204929	10205189	Thanks.
10206371	10209036	Garth, you've seen what's happened to me about my VTuber.
10210178	10215507	Yeah, I mean... My inner ferret has emerged and is about to become a possum.
10215527	10215908	Really?
10217530	10221357	Yeah, I think I'm leaning toward the possum end of the force.
10221995	10222879	Hey, that's fun.
10223501	10226433	I go on walks throughout my neighborhood at night and I see them running around.
10227638	10230149	Just because if you back me into a corner, I'll hiss too.
10230751	10231012	Yeah.
10231635	10231735	Yeah.
10232187	10236452	Garth, before I let you go, SP Azura is wondering, is that the Secret Labs Final Fantasy chair?
10236853	10237954	And I think I clocked that too.
10237974	10239757	Oh, yeah.
10240398	10241519	It sure is.
10242040	10243862	Oh my gosh, you nerd.
10244162	10245184	Wow, that looks really good.
10245284	10246445	I could not resist it.
10246505	10248969	I needed a better chair for the longest time, and then I saw that.
10249109	10249449	No.
10249970	10250871	Justified.
10250891	10251892	Absolutely justified.
10252173	10252513	Love that.
10252613	10253114	It's comfortable.
10253775	10256338	All right, Garth, any other final thoughts before we let you go?
10257601	10282680	uh just looking forward to everything that's next and whenever Kylie releases new tracks I know I can look to your blue sky and get that there 100% Kylie's a goddess there's a Christmas thing I think right now so uh I saw that yeah there's only one woman above Kylie and that is Stevie Nicks all right true true all right take care guys have a good one you too bye

10287551	10291976	Who's this?
10291996	10292536	Hey, you're muted.
10292656	10294298	God damn it, people.
10295519	10301786	Just assume when you get brought into this channel, I think you're getting muted by default.
10301806	10302607	I think that's what happens.
10302627	10303628	I think Discord is muting you.
10303869	10304349	What's up, buddy?
10306592	10307593	Still not hearing you.

10341723	10342445	Hi!
10342805	10344309	Oh my god, a working microphone.
10344349	10344890	Hi!
10346193	10346935	Hi!
10347917	10348779	Well, oh my gosh.
10349902	10351706	So I'm not good at being concise.
10351986	10353430	I know Captain Spike's listening.
10353490	10354412	He can attest to that.
10354552	10356677	As can I, to be honest.
10357450	10360416	I've got Mr. Timer ready, so I'm going to try to keep this short.
10360877	10364303	I really just want to congratulate all of you for your legendary run.
10365345	10373801	Obviously, you've inspired many people, including myself, but really, nobody else does it like you, and I don't think anyone else ever will.
10374423	10378851	There's never going to be another OLR, and there shouldn't be, because...
10380147	10381512	No one's ever gonna compare to you.
10381813	10389820	I feel really lucky that I actually got to come to LLR Studios a couple times and be a part of the LLR legacy.
10390576	10394462	All I can say is that it's really incredible what you all have done.
10395484	10400112	Unless you're going to pull a share and this is not really a farewell tour, you're going to be greatly missed.
10400152	10405761	But I'm glad that you're going out on a high note and you're all going on to great things.
10405781	10411331	So thank you for the memories and letting me be a part of it and all the LL Army.
10411431	10415217	And I look forward to your next ventures.
10415804	10417466	Holy shit, that was pretty concise.
10417547	10418127	Good job.
10418248	10420130	No, we appreciate you.
10420511	10421953	We appreciate you so much, Slykick.
10421973	10424377	And I'm so happy that GameBooey.org is back.
10424457	10425839	I'm so happy for you and Spike.
10426500	10428964	And it's just such a good and well-informed show.
10429104	10432469	So thank you for being here and thank you for joining us on this journey at VOG Network.
10432489	10434572	Thank you for being on panels.
10434552	10437516	that represent gamers and podcasting.
10437536	10447430	Because as you heard in the last call, and I'm sure you've heard in your experiences as well, it's important for us to be visible because we touch people sometimes in ways that we don't expect by being visible.
10447510	10449032	Or the way that they don't expect.
10449273	10449493	Yeah.
10449613	10449833	Yeah.
10449893	10450334	100%.
10450354	10451796	100%.
10452978	10454159	So, yeah.
10454219	10456062	Thanks to you for being along for this ride.
10456883	10457985	Really appreciate you sliding.
10458085	10458906	Thank you.
10459409	10459970	Oh, thank you.
10460010	10466577	And I just have to point out, I was already super gay when I met you, but you taught me to be fabulous, Rob, so thank you.
10466597	10467318	Oh, thank you.
10467338	10468399	You're welcome.
10469500	10484016	Well, I know you got other people waiting, so thank you for having me on your last show, and I guess I'll just say... Wait, wait, since my co-host won't do this, can I promote your show and have you echo it back the way you would do with Spike, just this one time?
10483996	10484717	Of course!
10484997	10490824	Well, I hope you will all tune into the GameBooey.org video game podcast.
10490844	10492906	GameBooey.org video game podcast.
10492926	10493327	Thank you.
10493907	10496510	I've always wanted somebody to echo me, just like you, Echo Spike.
10496550	10497151	Alright, thank you.
10497491	10498813	Aw, thank you.
10498833	10500535	Aw, thank you.
10500555	10502137	Alright, I hope everybody will listen.
10502157	10507002	I'll echo you anytime, and I guess all I can say is, bye-bye, Baby Balloon!
10507963	10509565	Bye-bye, Baby Balloon!
10510169	10525712	Bye bye baby balloon Oh my god, I'm screaming Alright, let's get to our next call Hi, you are on, oh, they said, oh no, there we go Hi, you're on Orange, sorry, my list just changed right there Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio, who's this?
10525732	10531300	Somebody who has to hit that mute button on Discord Hopefully What is a man?
10531465	10532206	I had it.
10532968	10533108	Hi!
10533569	10534290	How are you?
10534490	10536013	Oh my god.
10536033	10536453	Holy shit.
10536874	10537435	Hi.
10537715	10538276	Oh, I'm up here.
10538597	10539839	God, you look so familiar.
10539879	10542063	Where have I seen you before?
10543085	10543826	My goodness.
10543886	10546711	I've met two of these people in person before.
10546851	10548133	One of them remembers me, I'm sure.
10549315	10550537	Absolutely.
10550517	10555245	Yeah, so, yeah, I wasn't planning to call in until about five minutes ago.
10556086	10556727	I'm glad you did.
10556747	10559532	Yeah, it's a long-time listener, first-time caller.
10559993	10561035	Looking forward to more.
10562677	10572914	Yeah, I wanted to call in and join the chorus of gratitude, as I mentioned in chat, for such a wonderful show that you guys have brought to us incessantly for decades now.
10573876	10575158	I remember...
10575138	10585396	Working at the Apple Store back in the mid-2000s and driving to work listening to you guys every day back in the early podcast days because we were slinging podcasts, you know?
10585656	10586398	It was a big thing.
10586418	10587079	It was a big deal.
10587199	10590926	So I recommended you guys a lot.
10591026	10594632	So hopefully got you guys a few extra listeners.
10594612	10597177	Yeah, I've met a couple of you.
10597578	10600343	Loki, I don't think I ever got the chance to meet you in person, unfortunately.
10600363	10603229	But I feel like I know you, having listened to you for so long.
10603930	10605273	You seem like an old friend.
10605714	10608860	And Rob, obviously, you and I keep in touch once in a while.
10609121	10609802	Anyway...
10609782	10621196	God, but looking at you now, and I'm having this reaction all night as I'm seeing people that I haven't seen in some time, you are a literal dad now.
10621396	10627363	I was laying in bed, putting my son to bed, and I was like, I'm thinking about calling into this.
10628064	10630928	And Carissa, my wife, was like, she was like, just go do it.
10631188	10632209	Please tell Carissa I said hi.
10632269	10633951	She's such a perfect cinnamon roll.
10633971	10636274	I will, and she has a message for you that I'm going to save until the very end.
10636394	10637055	Okay.
10637035	10662418	and I but I just I remember when you were like 18 like this is just it always blows my fucking mind anyway I messaged you I was digging through some old files I found a uh an email that a letter that I emailed into you guys during that first or second year that I was listening to you and I sent it to you and you're like dude what the hell this is crazy this is like 20 years ago so uh yeah it's it's been a long time like you guys have been a major part of my life um
10662854	10665601	But I did want to contribute something.
10665662	10668289	I have just a fun little exercise real quick.
10668610	10670956	I've been getting really into retro handhelds.
10671538	10675007	You know, your Anberniks, your MIUs for the people who are aware of these things.
10675375	10679481	and I got one, one of the little clamshell ones reminiscent of the GBASP.
10679521	10680603	I got one and I put it together.
10681103	10684689	I curated a list of games for my son and I gave it to him for his fourth birthday.
10684709	10686431	He's five now and he loves it.
10686471	10687292	He plays it all the time.
10687353	10697087	I wanted to ask if there's one game each of you could contribute from any era of gaming history to this five-year-old's gaming handheld, what would it be?
10697167	10698649	Holy moly.
10698967	10703958	Well, there's that part of me that's always going to go, the Guardian legend is like a must.
10704078	10705020	Not for a five-year-old.
10705040	10705942	Not for a five-year-old.
10705962	10709710	You have to be able to read a little bit to play that game because there's all the hints in there.
10709730	10713599	I'm enticing him to get better at learning how to read by telling him he can start his own Pokemon.
10713659	10716906	He can start his Pokemon adventure once he learns how to read.
10716926	10718730	That's a good one.
10718710	10722697	A classic game that would be great for a child.
10722817	10725341	I really have to noodle on this one a minute.
10725381	10728246	And tell you what, it doesn't need to be limited to a five-year-old.
10728266	10730210	Feel free to tell me, hold this one until he's 10.
10730310	10731672	Hold this one until he's 15.
10731692	10734577	Well, definitely hold Guardian Legend until he's like 10 or 11.
10734597	10738203	And Gunstar Heroes.
10738223	10739485	You have children, Loki.
10739505	10741729	You've been faced with this question before, I'm sure.
10741829	10742811	You should start.
10743668	10750013	I mean, it just depends on how comfortable the games they are.
10750033	10752522	He's very comfortable with games.
10752663	10753325	Okay, okay.
10753988	10754269	Uh...
10756257	10785876	I have what I want to suggest actually anything that's just like a classic good game like a Super Mario RPG yeah we're getting bigger Mario's your Sonic's all that he's working his way through Astro Bot he beat Astro's Playroom and he's about two thirds of the way through Astro Bot so yeah he's got the fundamentals and yeah we're starting to work on some of those more classic 2D reflex based type things wow yeah anything like that would be good cause like I know like with my kids they tend to like now
10786463	10804523	I would say Fantasy Zone, but it might be a little frustrating for the boss fights.
10805026	10824486	I remember that's something that we're working on with him is making sure he knows that games can be frustrating and knows that he knows that he can step away if he starts to feel that way so it might be a good exercise when my little sister was much younger we would play Dr. Mario together and she'd get mad when I went
10824803	10854304	um and then uh when my my bestie Becky when her son would come over he was maybe eight or nine or so Dan sat with him and they played through um the D&D game that was in the Saturn collection um why can't I remember which one it is um I'd love to just come in and be like oh yeah yeah but yeah and Golden Axe the Duel and I mean there's stuff like that
10854588	10855751	Yeah, cool.
10856172	10857296	Lots of great recommendations.
10857316	10857998	Lots of classics.
10858519	10860766	We've got a lot of gaming history to get through.
10860806	10863233	I'm going to lean towards the music.
10863493	10865078	It was Tower of Doom.
10866542	10866943	That was it.
10867193	10874727	I'm going to lean towards the music games, of course, and I'm going to say it might be he might be a little young because this game can be incredibly frustrating.
10874767	10877953	But I just think if I were a kid, I would have been obsessed with Parappa the Rapper.
10878474	10882281	I think should be or I'm going to send you a picture of his Halloween costume.
10882521	10883062	Oh, my God.
10883082	10883884	OK, OK, OK.
10884064	10886068	My and my wife's accompanying.
10886188	10890636	I should tell you what, I'll I'll I'll I'll I'll message you after the show.
10890616	10899109	but along those lines, think about the Dreamcast classics like Space Channel 5, 1 and 2 that I think would also be really good and really, you know, bright and stuff.
10899390	10905960	And then that leads me to a game like Crazy Taxi because I'm thinking about, I was thinking about games that have a great loop.
10906301	10910527	And I think, especially at that age, you need things that sort of like hit and they have a quick loop.
10910547	10916236	Like, cause I think I grew up on a lot of Atari 2600 games and most of those were just really, you know, basic loops.
10916257	10918480	Like I think a game like Kaboom
10918460	10922945	as simple as that game is with the paddle, that can be very entertaining.
10922965	10931074	I think when it has just a very quick hit sort of, you know, dopamine hit loop that you don't have the time to get frustrated because by the time you get frustrated, you're already starting over.
10931454	10942847	So I would really lean into that classic library and think about like your pitfalls of the past and those sorts of-
10943232	10946138	You said Crazy Taxi, and that's a great recommendation.
10946158	10947902	That's something I'm going to bookmark because I love that game.
10947922	10953955	That's the ultimate distillation of Sega at the peak of their arcade to home console peak.
10953995	10956421	They just, oh man, they nailed that one.
10956561	10959568	If only we had gotten Planet Harriers.
10959588	10962193	But whatever you do, do not do Donkey Kong Jr.
10962233	10962574	math.
10965676	10968066	I just recently played DK, was it 94?
10968267	10969371	The Game Boy one.
10969833	10975517	Finally got back and played that, and man, that's a... If you guys haven't played that one, you gotta give it a shot.
10975598	10976339	All right.
10976359	10977500	Well, my friend, I'm so sorry.
10977700	10979302	But due to time, I got to let you go.
10979322	10979762	But thank you.
10979862	10980964	We still have nine emails to get through.
10981004	10982225	But thank you so much.
10982485	10983766	I appreciate hearing from you.
10983786	10986409	And the last thing that Carissa wanted me to pass along to you.
10986449	10987730	Yes, but really quick, really quick.
10987751	10990213	I did want to say what I meant earlier.
10990513	10995038	Watching your growth and your journey through everything you did, I felt very, very proud.
10995078	10996419	Like, I knew him when.
10996680	10997481	I knew him when.
10998482	10999703	Well, you still let me know.
11001104	11001825	What's that?
11002345	11003167	You still know me now.
11003287	11005152	Of course I still know you now.
11005272	11007397	I'm not going to leave you alone just because the show's ending.
11007477	11008118	Good, good.
11008419	11009201	That's the right answer.
11009221	11010324	All right, what do you want to say?
11010604	11012408	Anyway, my wife says, bye, bitch.
11014714	11016759	Tell her I said, girl.
11018984	11019966	Bye.
11020958	11023081	Hey Rob, you know I still have that cross-stitch you got me?
11023101	11023682	Oops!
11023702	11026327	I dragged Loki to the wrong channel.
11026487	11030513	Justin dropped out so fast I put Loki in the channel.
11031695	11033198	I put Loki in the drunk tank.
11033298	11033739	No.
11034900	11038246	Hey Rob, I still have that cross-stitch you got me of the unicorn that says later, bitch.
11038887	11039488	I love it.
11039508	11040169	I love it.
11040189	11041351	Loki, turn your camera back on.
11041371	11042713	Sorry, that's my bad.
11043031	11045195	Justin, peace the fuck out.
11045235	11047478	And I couldn't get you back quick enough.
11047919	11048240	All right.
11049161	11051986	We're going to try this caller again who tried to call in a minute ago.
11052006	11053468	Hopefully he's been able to work on the audio.
11053789	11054229	Hello.
11054870	11055572	You're on Orange Chance Radio.
11055592	11055932	Who's this?
11057294	11057936	Hey, it's Matt.
11057956	11059738	You got it.
11059799	11060480	Matt.
11060820	11061521	What's up, Matt?
11061922	11063304	I want to see your pupper again.
11064446	11064907	He's right here.
11065889	11068914	My assistant.
11068994	11069815	What's up, my friend?
11071010	11077058	So last week I called in and did my goodbye, but tonight I wanted to kind of do something a little special.
11077499	11080864	Lately I've been doing on Blue Sky the O.R.
11080904	11083447	Did You Knows and kind of throw some stats out.
11084008	11087733	So with this, I'm going to rapid fire a bunch of things.
11090016	11092039	So...
11093133	11095076	All are started on June 23rd, 2002.
11095116	11100984	The top Billboard song that weekend was Nelly Hot in Here.
11102666	11105370	Okay, that's like a legendary song.
11105430	11108414	And actually, I'm like, okay, that doesn't feel that old.
11108434	11109756	That song doesn't feel that old.
11112339	11116706	The top album at the moment at that time was the Spider-Man soundtrack.
11116726	11117807	That feels old.
11119390	11126688	The movies that weekend were the top two movies were Minority Report, which was that debut.
11126708	11127209	Oh, God.
11127530	11129354	And Lilo and Stitch.
11129374	11129835	Oh, my God.
11129855	11131740	The original.
11131760	11131961	Yep.
11132021	11132542	The original.
11132562	11133224	Wow.
11133244	11135830	OK, that that's when I was doing the film in age there.
11136755	11141324	And when I was doing, speaking of feeling old, when I was doing research for this, I realized.
11141605	11145392	I have to read what SP Azure, because I agree with Jaskara, this is genius.
11145412	11152146	SP Azure said, my home pod plays that song, Hot In Here, if my room gets over 80 degrees.
11152166	11154190	That is so fucking genius.
11154254	11155796	That's what we should be using AI for.
11155876	11157499	That's what AI is for, people.
11157839	11158821	That's what AI is for.
11158901	11159361	Okay, sorry.
11159742	11160163	Sorry, Matt.
11160924	11170197	So speaking of feeling old, when I was doing research for this, I realized I graduated high school June 18th, earlier that week.
11171819	11176406	Which, by the way, the original OLR debut date was June 16th.
11177648	11181413	It was pushed back a week because I think Jamie had a sudden conflict.
11181433	11182695	It was supposed to be a week earlier.
11183136	11183316	Yeah.
11185000	11193489	The top selling games at that time were Medal of Honor, GTA 3, and the Spider-Man game.
11194430	11195611	That all adds up.
11196072	11198654	Again, I don't know.
11199695	11203519	You say the Spider-Man game and it's easy to think of the PS5 game, which is obviously a lot newer.
11203639	11208104	I know that's not the one, but yeah, it doesn't feel old.
11208124	11211868	And one game was released on that day.
11212979	11214721	Eternal Darkness on the GameCube.
11215022	11215643	Really?
11215703	11216544	It was released that day.
11216644	11217125	Okay.
11217566	11220169	Hey, I'm proud to share a debut date with that game.
11220189	11220790	Excuse me, that game.
11221351	11229623	No major celebrities were born on that day, but two days later, on June 25th, Benson Boone was born.
11229923	11230785	Oh, the backflip guy.
11230905	11231205	Okay.
11232607	11232707	Cool.
11232727	11233328	Interesting.
11233348	11238335	I'm sorry, this show is older than that guy by two days?
11238516	11239036	Yes.
11239056	11239858	Fuck me.
11240138	11240218	Yes.
11241143	11243346	I'm going to a home.
11245710	11249275	Top shows that week, CSI, Everybody Loves Raymond, and 60 Minutes.
11250738	11258670	And two shows debuted that month on TV that are still on TV now.
11258690	11259651	Can you guess what they are?
11260973	11265120	Two shows debuted on TV that week that are still on now?
11265741	11267363	Not that week, actually, that month.
11267443	11267944	I'm sorry.
11269460	11276933	They're probably reality shows, but Survivor was before that, and so was Big Brother, but I'm thinking they're shows in that same vein.
11276953	11278075	How about The Amazing Race?
11281480	11283383	Well, I'll tell you the answer.
11283704	11287390	The two shows were American Isle and The Bachelor.
11287871	11291417	Okay, so reality shows that were... Okay, okay.
11292106	11294371	I was going to say American Idol, but I thought that would have been earlier.
11294391	11294591	I know.
11294611	11296655	I actually thought American Idol was like 2001.
11296675	11297798	Why is it still on?
11298960	11301325	Well, it's off and on a lot.
11302868	11307478	So now on to the real final stats.
11307498	11308680	2000...
11308660	11312324	746 hours, 47 minutes, 5 seconds.
11312524	11316628	That's how many hours of OLR or runtime of OLR.
11316728	11324716	We are on three hours plus tonight, so I think we're going to cross 2750 by the time I'll send that.
11324816	11335326	Combined runtime of every episode of SNL, The Golden Girls, The Simpsons, Friends, and Doctor Who minus specials.
11336892	11338434	is that counting back to the 60s?
11340235	11364199	yes jeez yep the longest episode was episode 380 which was 9 hours and 39 minutes marathon episode that was a marathon episode shortest episode the shortest episode was 18 minutes and 44 seconds which was I think we considered that the diva fit show
11365394	11375624	I think after we got everything working, we just said, this is the show, fuck it I published that?
11375644	11390119	I think you published the last part where you just kind of went through headlines real quick Wow, oh yeah, Loki just read through the headlines Okay, wow, honestly, looking back, I'm actually surprised that hit the podcast feed
11392782	11397849	There were 33 interviews on OLR during its run.
11399872	11400453	So there's that.
11402816	11405800	Classic Games of the Week, and this is kind of like the last part.
11406220	11410166	There were 818 Classic Games of the Week.
11410647	11416895	No wonder I have trouble thinking of one.
11416915	11418958	225 of those were arcade games.
11420795	11422817	Do you want to guess what the next one was?
11424238	11425279	Not just the console.
11425360	11425980	It's a console.
11426000	11427422	I will give you a hint.
11427442	11427882	Saturn?
11428523	11429484	Yeah, it's got to be Sega.
11429504	11432246	It's got to be... SNES?
11432266	11432787	Yes, Saturn.
11434108	11435650	SNES or Saturn?
11435850	11438873	It was the NES slash Famicom, which was 132 entries.
11439193	11443077	I realized there wasn't that many Saturn games, so it couldn't be second.
11443117	11445500	Yeah, okay, that tracks.
11445600	11448443	Saturn was tied with PS2 at number three.
11448463	11449103	There we go.
11449123	11450124	Huh, okay.
11450705	11450785	Yep.
11451136	11471085	there were two consoles that never got an entry I would guess the Fairchild Channel F other than its own probably if we want to get I think yes, that's one of them there's two I know I've done Magnavox Odyssey games
11471065	11499165	GameGear, there were three
11500647	11502089	I know I've done a Virtual Boy game.
11502370	11504333	Atari Lynx.
11504353	11505454	She would have never picked a Lynx game.
11506176	11508539	I did pick a Lynx game, I think.
11508659	11509721	Did I pick California games?
11510803	11516371	I did not see... So the one I was looking for was Virtual Boy because I didn't see a Virtual Boy game in there.
11517794	11519857	I could have swore I did Red Alert.
11519877	11521339	No, I guess maybe I didn't.
11522028	11525251	I've done MSX games because I've done Metal Gear.
11525351	11527373	Maybe when you were thinking of it, you got a migraine.
11527653	11529054	Guess we gotta uncancel.
11529334	11531036	I'm just kidding.
11531356	11532877	I haven't done N-Gage.
11532997	11536080	Actually, some of the games I've done have had ports to the N-Gage.
11537101	11538842	And I have done the N-Gage itself.
11539583	11541685	I remember playing the N-Gage at E3.
11544047	11547710	Matt, I love... There's one last number I want to give.
11548631	11549732	It's a fun one.
11549852	11551393	It's $5,300,000
11551981	11552882	and 18,008.
11554404	11555646	What does that have to do with OLR?
11556127	11557508	Absolutely nothing.
11557528	11560993	Other than when you put that in a calculator, you get boobies.
11564658	11564798	Yep.
11565559	11566000	Nice.
11566020	11566801	No, it's a good stat.
11566821	11567822	It's a good stat worth sharing.
11567842	11568223	Thank you.
11569765	11570846	Well, thank you guys.
11571667	11577555	This show was a lot of fun and I love you guys and can't wait to hear what's next.
11577936	11579157	And you know what?
11579178	11581060	This isn't goodbye, but see you later.
11584313	11585055	Fuck off!
11587039	11588562	Boobies was so funny.
11588582	11588923	All right.
11588983	11589664	Thank you, Matt.
11589765	11590526	I appreciate you.
11590546	11591268	You're the best.
11591288	11591909	And it was great.
11592030	11592831	It was great to meet you.
11593252	11594054	And I'll see you again.
11594114	11597281	This is just this is just tell the next tell the next thing.
11597581	11597862	All right.
11598363	11599285	Take care of my friend.
11600142	11600983	All right.
11601384	11602585	Let's bring in another caller.
11603246	11605950	I'm trying to think of my expensive mascara so I don't cry.
11606130	11606450	All right.
11606791	11611717	I am going to say we have three people in the green room and those are going to be the last three after this one.
11611777	11615742	So please, at this point, if you haven't joined, you have missed your opportunity.
11615883	11623292	So I would send us a quick social media post or something just because I would like to end before the four hour mark if possible.
11623312	11624614	So, all right.
11624594	11629341	and some... God damn it, somebody sneaks in there right after I say that.
11629361	11629782	Fine.
11630643	11633066	Only because I know who you are and you're on thin ice, buddy.
11633567	11633868	All right.
11634609	11635490	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11635510	11635870	Who's this?
11638194	11644122	A voice Olard hasn't heard for, I want to say, 11 years.
11644142	11645464	It has been a long time.
11645745	11646326	Who is this?
11649010	11650011	Well, uh...
11650278	11661613	I know my name is displayed as AFK7Music, but that's literally like a mixture of my old names, one of which you remember as Amiga777.
11662935	11664577	Oh, I sure do remember you.
11664597	11666580	Wow, it's been a long fucking time.
11666600	11667141	How are you?
11670065	11670986	I'm still alive.
11671547	11672248	Thank God.
11673369	11676553	What have you been up to?
11676573	11677515	Um, a lot.
11677955	11678496	I mean...
11678847	11683392	I know I gotta be concise here, and so... Just say a lot.
11685334	11696345	Yeah, like, just lost family members, I've lost friends, lost jobs, there's been a lot of loss, and trying to figure out what to do with my life.
11696365	11707656	But you've persevered, and you're here, and let's celebrate that, because that shit is very hard, and sometimes it's hard to get up in the morning, but you're here, and so let's celebrate that, so hang in there.
11708783	11709364	Absolutely.
11710105	11713128	I'll cut to what's on my mind.
11714370	11723060	I think I got a really good one this time compared to the previous times I've told you guys what's on my mind.
11725663	11735514	Basically, what's on my mind lately is what I like to call console fatigue.
11737697	11738638	It's like I'm
11739445	11767427	I'm 38 now, and I just feel like I've kind of come to this point where this current generation that we're in, it's like I've felt like I've kind of fallen out of interest with everything that Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo...
11767998	11774106	I guess have been kind of doing, you know, with their respective ecosystems.
11774306	11788084	It's just seems like, you know, it's become more attractive for me to just play, you know, PC or mobile games now since they've just been they've just gone in a direction.
11788104	11790006	I just feel like I
11790762	11797695	Can't really afford to follow, you know, either financially or I guess literally.
11797715	11807112	That is a legit as fuck perspective is that, you know, it can be video games are getting more and more expensive and we have to make difficult choices sometimes.
11807513	11808675	That's why it's so important.
11808695	11813985	I think too, that we have the indie scene to choose from, which, you know, where you get a lot more like reasonably priced games and so forth.
11813965	11843635	I think that's completely reasonable that you feel priced out of the current generation of games don't make it ever feel like you're any less of a gamer and I've said this to somebody else another long time caller of this show years and years ago is that that doesn't make you any less of a gamer just because you're playing second hand games you picked up at flea markets on a console that's last generations that's just being a retro fan and there are so many good games
11843615	11847107	that will always be out there and available.
11847368	11854050	And yeah, I don't feel any lesser than just because you can't justify paying $70 for games.
11854070	11855234	That's a privilege these days.
11855535	11856679	And I think people forget that.
11858330	11861875	Also, you should just not care who cares.
11862516	11863357	There's no authority.
11863377	11864719	It's like, you are a gamer.
11865020	11865681	You're not a gamer.
11865781	11866282	Who cares?
11866362	11867704	Just do whatever you want to do.
11868104	11868545	100%.
11868645	11869226	It doesn't matter.
11869426	11870889	If you say you're a gamer, you're a gamer.
11871409	11876216	We're past the school-age days of like, oh, I'm better than you.
11876236	11876897	No one cares.
11877699	11878299	No one cares.
11880242	11883387	Yeah, so it's like, I just have been felt like I've been listened to.
11883407	11886852	I know like, at least like with Nintendo games,
11887135	11895466	I know I've asked for quite a few generations now that they make a new F-Zero.
11895706	11898330	I'm not really counting F-Zero 99.
11898530	11910046	It's nice that they brought that out to bring back memories and bring some new fans to the franchise.
11910867	11914932	But I'd say outside of that, it doesn't feel like a new, new
11915435	11917237	and F-Zero to me.
11917257	11920441	And I'm hoping that that changes in this generation.
11921062	11921923	All right.
11921943	11925887	Well, my friend, I've got to let you go because we have some more calls and more show to do.
11926488	11927089	But thank you so much.
11927109	11929151	It's so good to hear from you, Blast from the Past.
11929171	11932055	And I'm right with you there that they need a new F-Zero game.
11932656	11934578	And hang in there, gamer.
11936100	11937181	All right.
11937321	11938062	Love you guys.
11938082	11938663	You take care.
11938843	11939704	Take care, my friend.
11939724	11940565	Bye-bye.
11940950	11941711	Thank you.
11941732	11942052	All right.
11942192	11947262	So we're at that point where we have been running so long, I need to use the restroom.
11947282	11955358	So I'm going to ask DarkSakura if they could pull up the email bag and maybe get us started with one or two emails here before we get to our next call.
11955498	11955959	Thank you.
11956921	11957562	Yeah, sure thing.
11958143	11958805	Okay.
11958825	11963193	This is titled, Let My Final Email to OLR Be a Shitpost.
11963213	11963734	Fitting.
11964288	11966151	Hey OLR crew, it's Mari.
11966171	11969576	Well, since this is my final email to OLR, I might as well go out with a bang.
11970096	11973702	Hear me out, this is my pitch for a hypothetical Time Crisis 6.
11974783	11980812	So some of you may know that Time Crisis games have a hit combo system like Dodonpachi.
11980832	11983215	I didn't even realize that Time Crisis got the 5.
11983375	11986039	I thought it was like 3.
11986059	11986600	Right.
11986985	11993657	Well, what if they borrowed from Dodonpachi and added a hyper mode that makes your shots give more combo?
11994218	12006259	Also for the final boss fight, Wild Dog transforms into a floating flaming dog and spews 3D bullet hell while 200 BPM gabber remix of his theme with gratuitous use of Amen Breaks plays.
12006796	12012998	and the player characters are Rachel McPherson from the first game and Alicia Winston from the third game.
12014021	12017193	They kiss and get married in the ending and shout trans rights.
12017233	12018156	Thank you and good night.
12019081	12027978	I'm down.
12028138	12041123	I'm down.
12041103	12069540	I think that'd be cool as like a gun game where you have to shoot the mob or shoot like basically anything that's on the screen to the beat of the music or something like that in time and like kind of have that element in an arcade setting would be kind of cool I'm so happy for a throwback to Dodonpachi also I want to play the Enter the Gunja game and I don't know where I can play it hopefully they have it somewhere at one of these Dave and Busters or something so the next email is titled thank you
12070617	12071039	You're welcome.
12071099	12073748	I'm reading it, Rob, so hush.
12074350	12075555	Musical Gun Gun.
12076578	12077321	They already have that game.
12077361	12078003	Cool.
12078024	12079007	I will have to play that.
12079730	12095106	Though I have not been the most active member of the community owing to that old thing called Greenwich Mean Time and the past year with real life bollocks, you have been a constant in my life since I found you way back in 2006 with episode 176.
12096047	12104235	You've been there every Monday morning for me, through it all, family bereavements, personal health problems, figuring out where I was going and who I am, and giant enemy craps.
12104536	12107041	All right.
12107923	12125717	All right.
12125917	12129563	Loki's numerous rants, Rob absolutely losing it laughing.
12129583	12135071	Perhaps my favorite of all is Jamie and I doing gift swaps in some of Shermie's for accidentally making its way to the UK.
12135452	12136774	Believe it or not, I still have it.
12137755	12138196	You do?
12140279	12140419	Oh.
12141982	12143484	Okay, now I'm gonna cry.
12143925	12144265	Okay.
12144746	12145427	Stop.
12145846	12147468	Expensive mascara.
12147488	12148750	Urban decay.
12149831	12150412	Alright.
12150432	12157381	To echo Actdeft last week, I get it as well, and the bittersweet feeling of an ending paving the way for rest and new beginnings.
12157942	12167034	Earlier this year, I had to part from a project which also spanned a good part of 20 years, though not consecutively, which subsequently meant it ending.
12167054	12173743	The guilt was something else, but worse was the guilt of having to try to find the time and energy amid literally everything that
12173723	12185303	Thanks for watching!
12185823	12187085	Do not feel guilty for the end.
12187145	12189488	Be happy that it happened in the first place.
12190209	12195657	The gaming and podcast worlds will be poor without you, but most importantly, our ears.
12197259	12202847	Though the show is coming to a close, I like to think of this quote, sometimes you can't go back, but you can always visit.
12203468	12205110	All the best in your future endeavors.
12205190	12207253	Much love and thank you so very, very much.
12207493	12209496	Rob Kidman, Kidman Project.
12209516	12210177	Thank you so much.
12210197	12212721	That was very well put and I appreciate that.
12213802	12215745	He shares a birthday with my mom.
12216012	12216573	I love that.
12217475	12217775	All right.
12218396	12219218	Let's get back to the calls.
12219238	12220340	We have a few more calls.
12220360	12221342	Let's get to it.
12221362	12225649	And hopefully folks are ready as I pull them in to put them on the spot live on air.
12225709	12227633	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
12227653	12227973	Who's this?
12229075	12230097	This is the Drew.
12230578	12231440	Oh, my God.
12231460	12232501	Who let you in here?
12232521	12233243	Oh, I guess that was me.
12234104	12234745	Yeah, sorry.
12234806	12236048	Had technical difficulties.
12236148	12237070	Knocked over the mixer.
12237170	12238552	Had to call Echo 123.
12238933	12239033	Okay.
12239924	12240865	I appreciate you.
12241105	12247231	And I remember a certain co-worker of yours sending a message saying, you're going to be there, right?
12248692	12250093	Well, here I am.
12251675	12252936	So, what's new?
12254778	12255499	Oh, Jesus.
12255559	12256439	Besides this?
12256459	12258261	Just say a lot.
12258281	12259162	Yeah, a lot.
12259422	12260563	A lot.
12260683	12262745	I'm not going to take up too much of the time.
12262785	12264967	I know it's been a mini marathon here.
12265608	12266669	But, man, oh, man.
12266769	12268851	I got to say...
12269371	12270734	What a long, strange trip it's been.
12270855	12276789	Y'all have been absolutely the, from your first broadcast, the best birthday present I ever got.
12278413	12280337	And you three kind of shaped my life.
12280357	12283144	So I just want to say I appreciate y'all for it.
12284558	12288862	Yeah, any future endeavors y'all have, I'll be waiting with bated breath.
12290524	12290965	Damn.
12291025	12294308	Tearing up myself.
12294328	12294889	Sorry, y'all.
12294989	12298572	No, we appreciate you, and thank you for giving us somebody to pick on.
12298712	12300014	And you know we never really meant it.
12300454	12303958	You've been an incredible friend and a piece of this show's lore.
12306500	12308222	The toilet paper roll's getting framed.
12308362	12310544	You really are a piece of our lore.
12310565	12312286	I'm never changing your picture on my phone.
12312767	12314008	And you shouldn't.
12314680	12317591	Drew, thank you so much for being along for the ride.
12317611	12319218	Again, we're not going away.
12319238	12320784	We're just going different directions.
12320804	12324960	And I hope to see you in the future with whatever we're all involved with next.
12325936	12327178	Love y'all.
12328100	12332166	Happy trails.
12334730	12338897	Love you too.
12339158	12340360	Take care.
12340400	12350897	Bye.
12350877	12378724	Loki, DarkSakura, Robb
12378822	12379925	Hey, it's J.B.
12379945	12380226	Henry.
12381249	12393844	I went by three other letters back in the day, DMN, but I heard what was happening with Orange Lounge Radio, and I really wanted to tune in on the 23rd of November, however...
12393824	12421350	I've had things happening I'm actually going to be as of the broadcast of the final episode of LLR I will be in the middle of a charity marathon for Extra Life my 16th annual one I really wanted to say something because to me it's important that all these years later I'm doing my own Twitch channel and doing my own thing to me it's very very important to acknowledge where you came from and
12421330	12440723	if it wasn't for you guys giving me opportunities to do dumb things like STFU and whatever the hell else I don't remember other shows I did and then working under sedation for a little bit I wouldn't be where I am today creatively and I have nobody to thank but the three of you
12441310	12457547	Thank you for watching!
12457527	12483130	and I hope whatever wherever your journeys take you creatively they're just as fruitful as this you've managed to bring a lot of people together and while I've been outside of that sphere for a long time again it's important to remember where you came from I love you guys and again nothing but the best for you as you move on in your journeys creatively you guys are the best and somebody's gonna have to come along and
12483110	12489148	Do a 24-year video game podcast, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.
12489168	12490592	Again, congratulations.
12490612	12494503	Love you guys, and take care, and remember, make every day a great day.
12495749	12500695	Thanks so much to... I just remember the old name DMN.
12500735	12501035	I'm sorry.
12501055	12502117	I know you don't go by that anymore.
12502137	12503218	And I remember Bressel.
12503839	12505941	I think JB Henry said his name is.
12505961	12512910	But the thing I am going to point out, my friend, I do notice in the background, there's a little thing that says points 420 when lit.
12513450	12514371	Is that a weed?
12514972	12518196	Is that a weed?
12520117	12524083	Anyway, no, I really appreciate the message.
12524103	12524984	That is really sweet.
12525064	12533076	And I've said I'm very grateful to people that have said such nice things about the show and so forth.
12533416	12537903	And I'm glad that you're doing your thing and raising money for charity is a great cause.
12537943	12539445	I had no idea it was Extra Life Weekend.
12539465	12540086	I'm very sorry.
12540587	12542690	Didn't realize that we were doing that.
12542710	12546115	But you're never going to find a week that's completely empty.
12546535	12549820	There's only so much time on this earth.
12549800	12573917	DarkSakura.com
12573897	12575822	I want to read just a few notes here.
12575862	12578048	I did get some DMs on Twitter.
12578449	12579632	I see you're not Twitter, BlueSky.
12580214	12587554	And BlueSky, we got a direct message here from MissingNo, who this is intended to be read.
12587594	12589459	So I'm going to read this saying...
12589439	12593968	I kept putting off writing this email because I didn't know exactly what to say.
12593988	12598136	Alas, all good things must come to an end, and it's humbling to be reminded that nothing lasts forever.
12598556	12602584	I just wanted to thank all of you for 15 plus years of amazing live shows.
12602644	12604127	I'm going to guess for him.
12605590	12607794	Because it's been 23, but that's fine.
12607934	12609878	I first discovered you...
12610381	12613665	Oh yeah, sorry, I'm reading chat and this, and I shouldn't be doing that.
12614065	12619591	I first discovered you while browsing the web with the PSP browser before Loki's app, and I've been listening ever since.
12619611	12622494	I'm not the most vocal or interactive member of the community.
12622514	12625498	I've always been shy, but you guys have been an important part of my life.
12626018	12629602	I did meet Rob once outside the Heinz Convention Center at PAX East 2010.
12629863	12632626	Even though it was brief, it meant a lot to me.
12632646	12639173	Well, thank you for that, and it's really great to have met a lot of listeners over time as well, and
12639153	12640356	I'm sorry.
12640376	12656672	I'm sorry.
12656652	12658935	Minna, I'm trying to read a direct message on Blue Sky.
12659516	12665004	I wanted to at least write this to let you all know how appreciative I am of your dedication to the show and your reporting on the industry.
12665425	12669431	I actually learned a lot of what I know today about the inner workings of the industry because of you guys.
12669451	12672956	I honestly don't know what I'm going to do with my Sunday nights now.
12673276	12674458	I'll never forget OLR.
12674518	12676361	You've truly been the podcast of a lifetime.
12676801	12679545	Thank you and I can't wait to see what projects come next.
12679565	12686355	Signed, MissingNo64, Andrew E. Thank you for the direct message and appreciate the
12686335	12688838	All right, DarkSakura is back.
12688918	12692061	So I'm going to get my screens in order here and get to our next caller.
12692161	12698268	So caller, if you can hear me, be ready because I'm going to pull you in here just as soon as I get my screens sorted.
12698288	12699149	All right, here we go.
12699209	12699990	Let's get back to it.
12700010	12701211	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
12701231	12703674	Who's this?
12703694	12709661	You know, you really can't have a farewell party without the party animal.
12709881	12710441	I'm just saying.
12710842	12710942	Yeah.
12712390	12714417	Hello Ranma, how are you?
12715460	12721540	I'm good, I just got back from PAX Unplugged and I had a really good time.
12722650	12723652	That's good.
12723772	12727639	I was just reading about an encounter at PAX East from years ago.
12727719	12728641	So you had a good time.
12729462	12732588	And we'll hear more about it on Anime Jam Session this week, right?
12734451	12735012	And you will.
12735653	12743908	And I just want to say that I remember that one Katsukan that you went to that you wore my Black Mage cosplay.
12743948	12744068	Yeah.
12744048	12773937	and as we were walking around in the dealer's hall one of the vendors recognized you and I remember exactly I think there was a conversation you two were having and he goes hold up you're Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio sometimes the voices have done interesting things over the years because that's very similar to the story at the restaurant that Jamie brought up earlier is that they don't know when they see us but when they hear us then it's like wait a minute you sound so familiar yeah
12774338	12799401	Mm-hmm, definitely.
12799381	12807614	OLR and Rocky and hosting and stuff have led to some interesting encounters over the years, but I'm always appreciative that people say hello.
12807634	12808555	There's no need to be shy.
12808656	12813303	I don't bite unless you ask, and you have to ask really nicely and have all your checks.
12814705	12817089	To be fair, I've had shots.
12818030	12819753	You've had a lot of shots tonight, DarkSakura.
12819913	12821396	Anyway, sorry, Ranma.
12821456	12822317	What were you going to say?
12823327	12834333	I mean, to be fair, I was at a Wawa about a few months ago, you know, doing my normal shopping, and this girl is, like, talking to me, and she's like, have you been to this convention?
12834434	12835075	And I was like,
12835848	12836208	Yeah.
12836929	12841155	And he recognized me outside of my cosplay, so we were talking back and forth.
12841375	12843738	And it's kind of cool things like that does happen, you know?
12844019	12844219	It does.
12844559	12844900	It does.
12845060	12850747	It's great to have friends around the country and really around the world, including yourself, Ranma.
12850767	12860700	I'm so thankful that we've been able to meet thanks to this little program and all the success that you've had and getting to come see you in New York City, which I promise I will do again.
12861521	12863003	And yeah.
12862983	12870753	Don't forget that one time we met at 8 on the break and we went to my friend's house to play DDR and then we took you to a diner, okay?
12870773	12871755	I 100% remember.
12871795	12874659	We don't have diners in California the same way they do back east.
12874679	12875680	It is so different.
12876621	12877743	You know, there might be a diner.
12877763	12878324	It's not the same.
12878404	12879205	It's not the same.
12879405	12881508	It's more strip mall here.
12881528	12882089	It's not the same.
12882169	12884552	I remember we were driving back from Fanamee.
12885443	12887385	and my Lancer at the time.
12888106	12889968	And I was like, y'all want to go to Treasure Island?
12889988	12890548	You said, sure.
12890588	12894893	And I drifted onto the exit in my Lancer.
12896034	12898376	That was the following year I came out there.
12898817	12900178	Because I was thinking about that.
12900719	12905504	You know, it was like, who would have thought me going to a convention?
12906565	12909728	Next thing you know, we're just the best of friends, you know?
12912471	12914573	It's just pretty awesome like that.
12914738	12923646	Speaking of which, Ranma, I know we did this earlier with Brad from PodCulture, but I'm not fucking letting you out of here until you lead us in a toast.
12923666	12923986	Okay.
12924367	12933515	Now, you know, normally I would have bottles, you know, a shot or whatever, but I was going to use, I was going to get a can of Strong Zero, which randomly disappeared.
12933535	12939100	So I found one of my favorite Japanese adult beverages, Sapporo.
12939741	12942383	I approve of that, although I am a Kirin fan.
12942650	12944111	Oh, I love Kirin, too.
12944312	12945773	The extra dry is really good.
12945853	12946574	I'm not gonna lie.
12948796	12949577	I'm waiting.
12950417	12950858	Okay.
12951398	12952459	Yes, sir.
12954061	12954821	Here's to you.

12960287	12967553	If we should ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
12967573	12968114	L'chaim.
12970136	12971357	Well said.

12987468	12988409	Love you, Ranchan.
12989110	12990231	Love you, Ukchan.
12990251	12994797	And I will send y'all off with something I say for my podcast where we rate somebody else.
12995536	13000661	From the late, great Jerry Springer, take care of yourselves and each other.
13001521	13002022	Good night.
13002042	13002883	Good night, my friend.
13002903	13003243	Take care.
13004084	13004544	You too.
13004564	13011671	I'm loving that all the listeners tonight are like, wow, all the OLR listeners got their salt and pepper beards.
13011731	13014133	All of you are reacting, but you also are being very kind.
13014153	13015214	Thank you for uplifting everybody.
13015234	13017756	Y'all, they're everybody's cuties and stuff tonight.
13017856	13021660	So let's see if y'all think our next caller is a cutie.
13022020	13022580	Here we go.
13023341	13024662	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
13024702	13025543	Who's this?
13025523	13028614	Oh my gosh.
13029597	13030641	Look what the cat dragged in.
13030681	13032266	You gotta unmute yourself on Discord though.
13034173	13034875	Hi.
13035631	13037634	Hi, sorry, just a moment.
13037995	13038155	Nope.
13038776	13040760	Oh my gosh, it's Extifer.
13040780	13041721	Is this cutie?
13041741	13042443	Hi, it's been fun.
13042463	13045288	It's Extifer from Horn House, and Lord knows what other shows we've done together.
13045348	13046289	Guys on a show, whatever.
13046309	13047031	Lord knows.
13047131	13048994	Lord knows.
13049094	13050416	Lord the singer knows a lot.
13051638	13052580	Your albums are really good.
13053141	13053822	How are you doing?
13053842	13056647	You've been waiting for like 45 minutes to get in, so thank you for that.
13056707	13059412	I know, it's like 12.43 here.
13059532	13061335	Oh my god, I'm sorry to these listeners.
13062462	13068648	I already took my ambience What did you want to say?
13069770	13071912	Oh, no, no, no What did you want to say?
13072913	13092013	Thanks for being here No, I'm actually so happy you're here tonight because you've been huge in this show We talked about lore earlier You've been huge in this show's lore not just from the spinoff shows but I know this show was at a place that you lived as well for so many years I'm just watching Firefly with you
13092297	13093478	Aw.
13094519	13097723	Well, I do have a lot of fun memories.
13098584	13106533	And I know that this show means so much to all three of you.
13107714	13120768	Having seen it behind the scenes in the past, and I'm, God, like 20 years ago, is when I started to be on it, right?
13122065	13125966	You can tell...
13126216	13133624	When you watch it behind the scenes, how much you guys do in preparation for the show.
13134205	13140172	And I hope that people respect that and understand that.
13140612	13145979	And it's definitely a commitment that I just couldn't do myself, right?
13146139	13148161	I mean, you know this for sure, Rob.
13148181	13149783	Horde House went, what, 180?
13150003	13151565	Nowhere close to 1,000?
13151725	13152426	No, I'm just kidding.
13152406	13153588	And you know what?
13153768	13156812	It would have gone 160 if it was my choice.
13158695	13159997	I'm just kidding.
13160017	13160618	I miss you.
13162421	13171454	But I just wanted to say, gosh, you know, 20 years ago, we were different people.
13171694	13174719	I was your roommate, Rob.
13174879	13176321	And they were roommates.
13176824	13189737	and whenever you would do the show you know I have fond memories of Matt's wife coming over we watched Desperate Housewives while you guys were doing OLR and like doing that
13190307	13208209	and I just you know it's it's definitely a part of my it was a part of my life and I just wanted to say that it I didn't know that it was your last show until 45 minutes ago.
13208229	13213535	Well you know news is slow to travel sometimes it's right you've been busy.
13213555	13213615	But
13214287	13235890	you know I'm also busy so anyways I don't know where I'm going with this but I just wanted to say that I hope you guys you know whatever the future holds for all three of you I'm sure that it's going to be bright and yeah that's what I have to say
13236241	13238683	Well, it's really a delight to hear from you.
13239104	13245930	I have not seen you in quite a long time and it's just nice to see your face and I hope we get to hang out again soon.
13245950	13248913	I know you're on the other coast now and you're like, oh, I got a kid.
13248973	13250834	I got children to be responsible for.
13250854	13255699	But I hope at some point we get to hang out again.
13255879	13259282	Sometimes I need a break from the kid.
13259422	13263666	But, you know, so on those times, I'm sure that
13263646	13266410	We could make something work out.
13269394	13272599	I was just thinking, I'm sorry, I don't want to take so much of your time.
13273660	13282953	I was just thinking we're going to be visiting California soon for the holidays, but we're not going to be in the Sacramento area.
13284796	13285537	So that's a bummer.
13285917	13289282	But I know that whenever we do come out there, like
13289768	13291810	Definitely we should all get together.
13291930	13298698	If you're down for it, text me when you're here because my work schedule gives me every other Friday off the way it is now.
13298758	13299599	I work longer days.
13299619	13301962	You're so busy all the time.
13302002	13302383	I'm kidding.
13302443	13307008	But I drive to LA easily now and I can always stay with Victoria down there.
13307128	13311473	So just, well, assuming she'll have me, but you know, just let me know when you're going to be there.
13312010	13330956	yeah, of course alright, take care guys thank you for everything, take care, we'll see you well, actually we won't see you because the show is ending but I will see you hopefully sometime soon alright, take care guys bye alright, well shall I dig back in?
13331236	13340008	I've got one more call one more call, the last call the last caller ever
13340225	13341409	to Orange Launch Radio.
13341971	13346165	And there's no one I would rather have.
13346185	13347891	Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
13347911	13348513	Who's this?
13349641	13372290	This is Bobby Blackwolf.
13373030	13383084	It's I'm glad we can bring this full circle because you have always been generous enough to have me us on at the end of your show for the better part of 20 years.
13383104	13388892	I mean, maybe we were doing the teases the whole time, but 18 or 19 years you've had us on at the end of your show.
13388912	13393298	And I can think of nobody better to end our show with at least call wise.
13393318	13395321	I always still have some emails, but at least call wise tonight.
13395761	13398505	So what's going on?
13398525	13398966	How you been?
13399006	13400067	What's what's new?
13400722	13401443	A lot.
13401804	13402886	And I'll just leave it at that.
13403166	13410038	There was a factoid that SSJ100Matt missed.
13410760	13412683	And I did the math, because I do math.
13413485	13415929	Because I've been listening for longer than I've been 29.
13417051	13417752	But...
13418542	13424108	If you take today and you count how many days it's been since you started.
13424388	13424608	Okay.
13425069	13427251	That is 8,554 days.
13427331	13427491	Okay.
13428252	13434939	If a show ended on June 23, 2002, it would have started.
13434979	13437902	Are you ready for the date it would have started?
13437922	13438182	Okay.
13439023	13440364	January 21, 1979.
13440764	13441745	Jeez.
13442046	13448312	I just thought I'd share that for you.
13450739	13451420	You're welcome.
13451440	13452381	Less than half my life.
13452861	13453662	You're very welcome.
13456446	13462392	Oh my god, I hate literally the most annoying fucking statistics in the world.
13462432	13468339	Today is X many days as this day was to this day.
13468359	13468579	Uh-huh.
13470061	13470942	Oh my god.
13470962	13471843	You're welcome.
13472063	13472964	You're very welcome.
13472984	13473885	Literally half my life.
13474266	13476168	More than half of Matt's.
13476248	13477730	Matt's younger than me.
13477750	13478451	More than half.
13479932	13480493	Wow.
13481283	13483765	Well, Bobby, thank you for breaking my brain here at the end.
13483825	13484966	You're welcome.
13484986	13489130	So now I will be nice because I got the meanness out of the way.
13490071	13495776	So no, thank you for being a huge part of my life and my growth in this space as a creator.
13496177	13511070	What a lot of people probably don't know is that if the three of you weren't on board with my crazy ideas back in 2012, I probably would have quit podcasting in 2012 because I would have been alone.
13511573	13518353	Because of things that were going on, I was on the way out, and y'all were like, yeah, we'll go with you.
13518373	13519897	We'll hang out with you.
13520278	13521482	And y'all didn't have to.
13521502	13522485	You had other options.
13523347	13524992	And that meant a lot to me.
13525529	13527752	and all three of you.
13527772	13531638	And, you know, it's helped me do a lot of other amazing things.
13532099	13543236	Hanging out with Jamie at TwitchCon, talking about pinball and stuff and, you know, learning more about Minecraft through watching Matt's YouTube, which everybody should go subscribe to LokiOLR.
13543356	13544198	And how.
13544718	13547723	Yeah, and doing a lot of...
13548277	13554665	doing a lot of the convention stuff, learning from watching Rob do some convention moderating and hosting and things.
13556147	13556828	Whatever.
13556928	13559071	You do your own just fine.
13559331	13562055	I do, but I learn from other people.
13562956	13564458	I learn by watching other people.
13564478	13564878	That's true.
13565239	13565880	That's fair.
13566320	13570205	And yeah, and so that's like now I'm part of the Games Done Quick organization.
13570265	13573530	I will be at Awesome Games Done Quick in a month and a half.
13573550	13573930	Yay!
13573910	13580218	Doing that for the 11th time, so please watch in January, Benefiting the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
13580238	13582421	I don't know when, I just know I'm going to be there.
13583822	13593775	But thank you, because I'm sure my life would have been fine, but I think it's better with y'all in it.
13593795	13594616	And so that's all.
13594936	13595297	Thank you.
13595797	13598040	Stop!
13598180	13598280	Okay.
13598300	13600423	You're making me cry, asshole.
13601045	13601966	Thank you, Bobby.
13602126	13603508	January 21st, 1979.
13603688	13605750	Okay, I hate you again.
13607672	13609835	Until next time, Bobby.
13611477	13615081	For the record, you would still be the only person I would consider selling my Doctor Who to.
13615881	13617183	Aw, thank you.
13617363	13619826	Brad's going to be very angry at you for saying that.
13621848	13623610	Brad has to come here and plead his case.
13625072	13628976	Bobby, I just so appreciate that we have been able to be on a similar journey.
13628956	13647015	since I mean before 2012 but since 2012 we have done a lot of really cool shit together and I know we're going to continue to so yeah thank you thank you for being a part of it being the opening act but really you know how we feel the co-headliner yeah so all right
13647417	13650900	and you will be here next week.
13650920	13651601	Yes.
13651801	13653162	I am still going.
13653262	13654764	You will not have a four hour show.
13655524	13656345	No, I will not.
13656365	13657406	So people can carve out the time.
13658167	13658247	Yep.
13658267	13658968	All right.
13658988	13659608	Take care, my friend.
13660729	13661270	Bye.
13661690	13662351	Bye.
13662371	13663772	Bye.
13663792	13666134	Did he do the DarkSakura thing on the way out?
13666154	13668356	I think he did.
13668376	13668877	Wait, what?
13669097	13673161	Because, you know, later taters, he did the little thing.
13675523	13675743	Oh, my God.
13675763	13676123	I love it.
13676143	13676884	All right.
13677775	13678717	That's it for calls.
13678857	13682784	We do have some more emails and then we want to get to our final thoughts.
13682864	13684306	And I have some social media posts.
13684447	13687231	So if you need a break, DarkSakura, I have some blue sky posts I can get through.
13687472	13689115	So DarkSakura, more emails.
13689135	13689896	I'll get to a few of these.
13691699	13692861	Hello, OLR crew.
13692881	13698471	And by the way, if you have signed your name on this one, any of these emails, I'm going to read what you signed.
13700254	13701336	Fair enough.
13701637	13703039	Okay.
13703059	13704221	Hello, OLR crew.
13704241	13707245	This is titled, Thanks for All the Years.
13708286	13712833	I've been listening to you guys on and off for the better half of two decades.
13712853	13727273	I think originally I listened to you on my PSP back then I was working in Venezuela, and it was a way of keeping myself informed on what's happening in games, but at the same time, I just love the novelty of being able to use my portable PlayStation as a gaming and also podcast device.
13728215	13745683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
13745663	13756868	I can't explain why, because you are very different in the way I am and what I do for a living for the most part of my life, but most definitely felt some kind of connection.
13757730	13761799	I mean, you've managed to hit the 1000th episode, putting you into the Guinness Book
13762336	13762637	Wow.
13763238	13783855	Wow.
13783835	13798203	Anyway, I would say in the last couple of years or so, especially just as you were crawling up to your 1000th episode, I was listening regularly as I have two gaming podcasts that I consider to be very valuable to me in the way you present and banter about games.
13798223	13800848	And that's you and DLC with Jeff Kanata.
13801604	13809957	So anyway, to cut a long story short, I'm currently into my sixth year running my own company that specializes in sim racing steering wheels and accessories.
13811460	13812461	That's a real niche.
13812822	13819933	I bet my hubby probably has seen your stuff before because we were really into sim racing for a while.
13819913	13824582	That's a real niche, but it is in the gaming sector.
13824682	13828268	And to a certain degree, I would say you guys have inspired me to hold on to gaming and do it.
13828749	13832195	Let's call it a commercial baby that you helped make.
13832215	13835421	Because just like the guys from DLC, we're all old farts now.
13836143	13842394	And all those young kids and streamers that haven't lived through how far gaming has come in all these years.
13842610	13847838	and then anyway, you look at this and somehow it feels like we're a dying breed, the old gamers.
13848218	13861918	Just as retro gaming is coming back and things are possible that we couldn't have imagined such as VR where now you can now play Halo and Quake as ported PC games on an old, I'm sorry, on an Android device strapped to your face.
13862489	13888530	I don't think I would have said that about 20 years ago anyway just wanted to say thank you for all the fish I'll be missing you guys in game on best regards Mark that's mvhstudios.co.uk thank you for that it's so neat to hear from people we haven't heard from in a long time or ever so that's yeah thank you for the email I appreciate it okay I'm gonna read one more and then you can do some blue skies okay
13889776	13890417	Hello, Alar!
13890558	13893423	We know who this is, and the subject is In the Groove.
13893484	13896750	Excellent choice for the Pence Ultimate Classic Game of the Week.
13896971	13907312	In the Groove holds a special place in my heart, specifically because of something that it did very well in its 2004-2007 heyday, and that DDR did not.
13907292	13914953	DDR had a wide variety of great music, but most of its old maniac-heavy step charts sat firmly in the 7-9 difficulty range.
13915455	13922314	After playing for several years, there was a growing population of players that had mastered those levels and were looking for something more challenging.
13922294	13928866	But all of DDR's 10-footers came in one flavor, hard techno, created and charted specifically to be very hard DDR songs.
13929648	13938244	And the group featured a selection of actual dance music created for dancing and not for rhythm games, with step charts ranging in difficulty from 9 to 12.
13938646	13950127	Most of the charts flowed very well and weren't merely created to be hard but to be fun.
13950648	13955817	I had a great time and spent many hours playing 10s and 11s that were certainly challenging but were also really fun to play.
13956218	13963050	By comparison, when DDR Supernova released in 2006, the vast majority of its new expert and challenge charts were rated 6 through 8.
13963469	13971792	and of what few new tens we got most were super hard boss songs created for the sake of being hard not necessarily to be fun
13973392	13978558	Over the years, beginning with DDRX series and continuing through today, this problem was fixed.
13978578	13988831	DDR now contains a wide range of step charts for extra players as well as beginners with over 9,000 total step charts across 1,300 plus songs.
13989572	13994939	But in 2007, despite being a, quote, ripoff, this was in the group's greatest strength and DDR's greatest weakness.
13995500	13996020	So that's it.
13996241	13997402	My last email to OLR.
13997622	14002268	I don't have much to say that I haven't said already or that won't be echoed by others.
14002636	14010843	So I'll just say thank you very much for supporting me and my indie game developments dating back to Snake 360 in 2008 all the way back through today.
14010863	14011664	No, all the way through today.
14012325	14018891	I hope you'll look forward to next year's planned release of the newest version of that same game now called Snake Party Extreme.
14019511	14022774	I hope to finally release Bungie Ferret Tossing 1.5 as well.
14023475	14032643	Sorry, Jamie, I never got around to creating a Tempest ripoff called Vectords, but if I had in between levels, you would have been rewarded with a super crapper recharge.
14032623	14036608	Bye!
14036628	14037189	That's pretty good.
14037489	14038250	Life is incomplete.
14038370	14038911	That's pretty good.
14039031	14044558	All of the best to the three of you and to every member of the community you built.
14044618	14045980	Hugs, AaronYYR.
14046381	14047222	Thank you, YYR.
14048063	14052048	I already said this to you, and we're going to hit the four-hour mark tonight.
14053149	14055252	Thank you for everything.
14056394	14059778	You literally have immortalized us in games, and that is...
14060787	14063110	How many podcast people can say that?
14063130	14064532	There's a few, but not that many.
14064552	14066514	You took my poop idea and made it live.
14066534	14067195	That's right.
14067455	14069238	That's sure right.
14069258	14069618	All right.
14070960	14071961	Let me get through.
14072041	14072902	You gave my poop life.
14073463	14076767	Let me do some Blue Sky here and give you a break.
14076947	14078750	DarkTutsia messages us on Blue Sky.
14078770	14081313	By the way, we will still be on Blue Sky at OrangeLaundry.com.
14081333	14083576	I don't know what we'll use it for, but we'll figure it out.
14084117	14084377	All right.
14085358	14089984	So DarkTutsia says, most of what I wanted to say was already in the email from a couple weeks ago.
14089964	14116292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
14116390	14117311	from Critical Myth.
14117812	14118553	Remember Critical Myth?
14118634	14120757	Also a show here on VOG Network for a very long time.
14120777	14122560	Did a lot of great TV reviews.
14122660	14135841	Great crew, but John Kay runs the account and John's a great guy who says, in a very real sense, OLR was the reason I met so many awesome members of the VOG family, including the hosts of Anime Jam Session, who I've hung out with for years now.
14136242	14139347	And several years ago, they introduced me to my current partner.
14139687	14141470	So OLR changed my life.
14142260	14143343	Wild, wild.
14143383	14144526	Well, and I've mentioned this before.
14145007	14147835	OLR brought me closer to the guy I ended up marrying.
14147855	14154733	I didn't meet him through OLR, but I met him through LiveJournal, and I think OLR was a way for him to, like...
14155321	14160786	See Me During the Week, if that makes sense, and gave us something to kind of talk about for a while.
14160907	14164830	So yeah, I mean, it changed mine too, that's for sure.
14167053	14175861	A few of you really sent some nice messages when you were posting about listening tonight, including Elliot B. I caught that name because I haven't seen that name in a while.
14175881	14180586	Elliot B. said, I've been listening to this show since iTunes introduced podcasts in 2005.
14180566	14183910	Thank you to the hosts for their dedication and congrats on an incredible run.
14184311	14186614	Thank you for messaging that.
14186674	14200372	And then along those lines, Blue Swim, who sent an awesome picture of our show burned to CDs earlier this week, said, Tonight, the podcast that made me want to become a podcaster, Orange Launch Radio, ends their world record 23 and a half year run.
14200392	14209003	Thank you for so much laughter, so many moments, and the countless hours of enjoyment since I started listening back around 2005 on my Sony mini disc player.
14209220	14209781	Incredible.
14210762	14211363	Incredible.
14214047	14218974	Tiara slipped into our messages, and they said, it's the end of an era.
14219495	14228928	If it wasn't for OLR, I would have never met my dear friend, Rob K. Rob introduced me to my husband, and Dan and I have been married for more than 13 years now.
14228948	14232974	Funny how something as innocuous as a gaming podcast can change one's life forever.
14233695	14234316	This is...
14235241	14238610	It's incredibly humbling to hear these different stories.
14239352	14240596	I've got one more message here.
14240616	14241438	I might have a DM.
14241478	14248678	I got to screen it first, but I have one more message here from Bryguy who says, Thank you, Orange Launch Radio, for 23 years of gaming news.
14248698	14251225	I started listening to you as a 16-year-old.
14251846	14255131	with a PSP hidden under a pillow.
14255151	14260398	All these years later, you guys made my one hour and 30 minute commute to work manageable.
14260799	14263062	You guys were always like friends I never met.
14263082	14264805	Best of luck with future projects.
14265566	14269692	Thank you for all of the nice messages.
14270473	14271414	I got a quick message.
14271515	14272556	Okay, I'm going to read this DM.
14272616	14274078	Last DM here from AJ.
14274659	14276342	This is wild.
14276522	14277143	Sorry, AJ.
14277343	14277944	Did I say DJ?
14278665	14278765	Okay.
14278829	14280071	Y'all, it's four hours.
14280091	14281834	The batteries are running out.
14281854	14290669	AJ Twist says, I don't know if this is fun, but fun fact, I was in a car accident while listening to OLR one Monday night 10 years ago.
14290689	14292271	So I'm assuming podcast feed Monday night.
14292992	14294735	Someone ran a red light.
14294755	14295276	I was fine.
14295316	14296238	The car was totaled.
14296719	14301867	Also, one of my favorite episodes was one without Rob, just Loki and DarkSakura.
14301948	14303410	Wow, thanks.
14305294	14309020	I remember having such a hard time running everything.
14309040	14309981	It was at my house.
14311263	14312485	I know where I fit in this.
14313086	14316472	I know the intention there and that's fine.
14316572	14317494	I forgive you, I guess.
14317954	14319998	Thanks again for all the years of OLR.
14320038	14321340	See you around.
14321742	14323825	Oh, we got a quick message.
14323845	14325528	Okay, y'all gotta save.
14325588	14330616	Everybody in chat's yelling, save Part B. No, it's all backed up on Twitch now.
14330656	14331337	That's the good news.
14331477	14331758	All right.
14333120	14338468	That was the dumbest thing I ever did was splitting the show into Part A and Part B. It was to...
14338972	14340574	I'm not even going to try to justify it now.
14340674	14343117	It was a bad decision, so I'm glad we fixed that.
14343177	14343457	All right.
14343597	14344618	It made sense at the time.
14345499	14348462	This is a great, yeah, it made sense at the time, but no, it didn't.
14348502	14350745	I'll do emails after that, and then if you have more of those.
14350965	14354969	Okay, I got one more message from Spike from Game Boy, and here it is.
14354989	14357953	I'd hoped to call in tonight, but we had a small situation offline to deal with.
14358393	14362738	However, Orange Lounge Radio changed my life for good, and I just wanted to be sure to state that plainly.
14362758	14364860	The community is better for what y'all have done.
14364880	14365661	I'm so serious.
14365681	14367443	I can't wait to see what you do next.
14368486	14395776	DarkSakura, emails.
14398253	14400777	This is titled, Thank you for 23 years of OLR.
14401498	14409189	Hi, I'm just sending a quick message to say good luck with the final show and thank you all for taking time out of your Sunday evenings to give us this show for so many years.
14410031	14414277	I've been listening to this show since discovering it on All Games through Bobby's show around 2008.
14414958	14418203	OLR comes from an era in podcasting internet shows
14418672	14424739	When the motivation was purely driven by love for the hobby and you've managed to keep that right up to 2025.
14426100	14430004	Whatever you all decide to do in the future, big or small, I'll definitely be checking it out.
14430185	14431947	This comes from Wayne.
14431967	14432747	Thanks, Wayne.
14432767	14433508	Appreciate that.
14433528	14436972	Appreciate the sentiment that you'll keep checking things out.
14437172	14437893	I really appreciate that.
14439034	14439355	Okay.
14439815	14442118	This one is titled, I hope this is not too late.
14442378	14443279	No, it's not.
14443850	14445913	It's okay if it's not right on air, but cool if you want to.
14445933	14446835	I procrastinated.
14447856	14451642	I kept putting off writing this email because I didn't know exactly what to say.
14452243	14457912	Unless all good things must come to an end and it's humbling to be reminded that nothing, sorry, lasts forever.
14458392	14461677	I just want to thank you all for 15 plus years of amazing live shows.
14462258	14466605	I discovered you while browsing the web with the PSP browser before Loki's app.
14466625	14467967	Is this from MissingNo?
14469027	14470831	They also sent this on Blue Sky.
14470851	14471512	I already read it.
14471673	14471953	Sorry.
14471973	14472755	Okay, so you already read it.
14472855	14473336	I'm sorry.
14473978	14474579	That's okay.
14474739	14475180	Good job.
14475341	14475922	Good job, Missy.
14475962	14476884	Was it while I was trying to pee?
14476904	14478708	Firing on all the silos.
14478728	14479911	Yeah, it was while you were about to break.
14479931	14480472	Yeah.
14480890	14483032	Don't cry because it's over.
14483092	14484233	Smile because it happened.
14485254	14486135	A little late for that.
14487836	14489018	No, I'm serious.
14489758	14490819	God, my nose is itching now.
14491980	14493562	Hi, Rob, Jamie, and Loki.
14494623	14498106	I was a little shocked to hear the news that you wouldn't be doing a show any longer.
14498246	14505853	I was a listener a long time ago, lapsed, and then had really gotten back into listening when I rediscovered you on Spotify toward the end of this year.
14506394	14508476	I'm not sure if this email will make the final show.
14508996	14510037	Spoiler alert, it did.
14510388	14513251	As I know you have a call-in special episode planned.
14513271	14517296	I live in the UK, so making the live show is unfortunately a bit tricky.
14517797	14521261	I think I joined back when there was an IRC, so 07.
14521742	14523304	I think FUs of the Week was a thing.
14524065	14529151	Although features may have come and passed, the core has always stayed true.
14529411	14532515	That's what I forgot tonight was FUs of the Week.
14533496	14533776	Oh, well.
14533816	14534657	I have an FU.
14534798	14536800	We're at four hours, so...
14538147	14540369	I knew it would be long.
14540389	14542071	We all knew it would be long, and we don't care.
14543613	14543713	Okay.
14544634	14549799	As per the subject line, it's amazing the dedication you guys have put out into this show.
14550280	14557587	And it's always been really refreshing to hear voices and opinions that can be truly honest.
14557607	14563193	You've never shied away from your true opinions or been beholden to shareholders, etc.,
14563561	14570407	I really respect you needing time away from a permanent scheduled thing and will hopefully follow you to future ventures.
14571048	14576353	It's been brought up the state of the industry seems to be on a crappy downhill trajectory.
14576393	14586122	The prevalence of venture capital firms and rampant shareholders, capitalism, the excessive overuse of the AI really make it all a bit of a depressing outlook.
14586142	14591307	Hopefully the big gaming companies will realize the customers are who pays their bills and if they don't
14591287	14594691	Well, I guess smaller studios and indies will always have a place.
14595572	14596072	Hopefully, U.S.
14596112	14597794	politics will level out in the coming years.
14597854	14602719	It's horrible to think that, as Rob mentioned, his marriage could be up for nullification at a legal level.
14602860	14604061	That didn't go, by the way.
14604922	14607945	And will everything gesture broadly toward Washington?
14608666	14614933	I wish you all the best in life, and please know your effect on the world goes further than you think.
14615113	14617776	You are very much appreciated and loved.
14617836	14619758	Carl, Southampton, England.
14620514	14622037	Thank you for the lovely note.
14622337	14623920	I don't even know what to say to that.
14623980	14624301	Thank you.
14624662	14626204	That's very impactful and touching.
14626224	14627146	And thank you for sending it.
14627386	14627687	Yeah.
14628448	14631714	I did want to just say, at least there was some good news.
14634399	14636844	Last show, Dearest OLR.
14637625	14639328	Dearest.
14639348	14640290	That's just very classy.
14640430	14641171	It is very classy.
14641813	14644277	Is it written in calligraphy?
14644831	14645492	No.
14646133	14648677	Thank you all for the shows over the years.
14648737	14652302	You guys did an excellent job and deserve a place in the Podcast Hall of Fame.
14652463	14654306	We have been listening since around 2008.
14654706	14663219	We found you on iTunes and since have listened to the podcast on all devices capable and then live on VOG, then live on Twitch.
14663239	14665863	Take care and hope only for the best for you three.
14666184	14668848	Sincerely, Mike and Jeanette SheHulk.
14668868	14669188	P.S.
14669248	14669649	My F.U.
14669669	14671632	of the week is getting old sucks.
14671814	14673057	Yes, it does.
14673137	14673518	Yes!
14676985	14677326	Thank you.
14677366	14678068	One last email.
14678368	14680713	Oh my god.
14680733	14681996	And it says thank you for everything.
14684281	14684381	Okay.
14684401	14684922	I might cry.
14685444	14686947	I know who this is.
14686967	14687528	Who is it?
14688925	14716553	I just wanted to pop in and say thank you for being my weekly ritual since 2005 since then I have subscribed and listened to many others over the years but it was Orange Lounge that I faithfully made sure to listen to during my work week every week thank you all for making this world a little bit easier to live in especially now and for giving us your time, love, and energy over the years you have been a blessing to many including myself sincerely, Terry in Kentucky thank you for that
14718322	14746810	it's wild to hear from people that we just haven't before um thank you all for your meaningful messages your phone calls your bleats your emails and just letting us know you give a shit it means it really means a lot and uh just really goes to show um I don't even know I don't even know what to say just like just just allowing us to have that sort of impact I so appreciate uh
14747161	14770536	you all and um you know again part of the reason this is this is just another evolution and I think I'm having a little nosebleed oh no okay um I hope everything's okay okay all right yeah it's it's it's just a little I'm trying not to get it on camera because you know I don't want to be taken down all right um
14770516	14771677	We've gotten through all the emails.
14771998	14775281	I give you the email address, but well, you don't need it.
14776442	14778325	We threw all the bleats.
14778725	14781208	I'll keep peeking at it over the next week.
14781488	14786153	Yeah, if you really need to get in touch with it, it'll still be open, but there's a lot of spam to get through.
14786453	14788355	And of course, we're all reachable on social media.
14788375	14789337	We're very accessible.
14789697	14796444	And I think many of you have said such kind things about like, oh, I couldn't believe I got to meet you in person.
14796484	14798767	And oh, I saw you at such and such thing.
14798787	14799848	We are...
14799828	14820975	incredibly normal fucking people that have been very fortunate to have this little platform that we learned how to build for ourselves 23 years ago and we are not our egos are in check enough that we are not unapproachable people and please reach out and say hello anytime
14820955	14840955	DarkSakura has a stream very regularly that you can pop in and say hello Loki has YouTube comments you can very regularly pop on and say hello I am addicted to Blue Sky you can always message me on there and I will at least give your comment a heart as long as you're not being mean so we're very accessible and we are not
14842606	14850796	on some high platform where we are not going to listen to you or say hello or whatever.
14850816	14852798	So yeah, reach out.
14852818	14853619	Reach out anytime.
14855481	14865573	With that, I would usually have a spiel here about next week and all that, but I don't need to say it.
14866874	14871600	So I will say the ending is going to be a little different tonight.
14871749	14877015	It will be on YouTube, and I would encourage the podcast listeners to check it out on YouTube.
14878677	14887827	I will also say we will not be back to read bits and subs tonight, because we just choose to end artistically with what we have to show at the end here.
14888567	14894774	And I will just say in advance, I saw the hype trains and the bits and subs.
14894894	14898178	I just want to say thank you, even though we're not taking a moment to acknowledge it all.
14898158	14899620	individually.
14899900	14906890	I do just want to give a big heartfelt thank you to all of you that really showed the coin and keep VOG Network going and on to the next thing.
14906910	14910394	We have some new follows tonight and that makes me hopeful going great.
14910414	14914139	People aren't subbing just because they think it's the end because it's not the end.
14914680	14915882	Bobby's still going to be here.
14916042	14922030	Game buoy, anime jam session, British invaders, dot, dot, dot.
14922050	14923552	So things don't die.
14923612	14924433	They just change.
14924794	14925094	Yeah.
14927673	14929235	The only thing that's left is our final thoughts.
14931998	14933820	I have a lot.
14933840	14935683	But I'm going to start with Jamie.
14935883	14936764	So, Jamie?
14938546	14940588	Why not reject false icons?
14942170	14946135	Fact check every fucking thing that you see online.
14948778	14955766	And... Thank you?
14955866	14956347	I...
14960478	14963882	Yeah, thank you.
14965144	14966285	And... You're welcome.
14972153	14972774	I had to.
14974816	14976358	For fuck's sake, Rob.
14978281	14979903	For fuck's sake.
14980223	14982846	That's my final thought.
14982866	14983507	For fuck's sake.
14986931	14988173	Okay.
14988980	14994246	No, and there are other things on the horizon.
14997450	14998351	I'm going to keep streaming.
14999092	15007442	I'm going to keep podcasting because I'm a loudmouth, you know, bitch who's got stuff to say.
15007722	15010265	Being in total control of herself.
15010285	15012168	No, no, I'm a bitch, okay?
15012428	15014450	I'm just being a bitch.
15014470	15015351	I will admit it.
15015512	15016793	I am spiteful.
15018123	15019024	I am spiteful.
15019144	15021726	90% of what I do is motivated by spite.
15022267	15025049	So you tell me I can't do something, well, fuck you, I'm gonna do it.
15025930	15026390	Within reason.
15029253	15034518	But yeah, I can't, yeah.
15035759	15041184	I don't have words, I just have feels.
15042345	15045868	And I don't know what all my feels are right now, but I am...
15047840	15059555	I'm going to offer a nice good bitch fest a little bit later on, so if you need to come and vent, I'll be here to listen.
15059715	15068826	In other words, you are streaming after the show tonight, so... Well, yeah, because if I don't stream after the show, I'm going to go drink, okay?
15069227	15075855	I'm going to drink, and it's going to be ugly, and then I'm going to watch the second season of Tokyo Ghoul.
15076223	15078945	I just finished the first season in two days.
15078965	15080026	Please check chat.
15080107	15082309	There's a lot of kind words for you in there.
15082329	15082969	I saw.
15083069	15083550	I saw.
15083570	15085391	That's why I'm getting more.
15086472	15087553	God damn it.
15087573	15088274	Stop it.
15088774	15090696	Actually, don't stop because I love you all.
15092678	15096481	Loki, your final thought.
15098503	15098984	I don't know.
15099564	15102767	I'm going to try to get through this.
15102787	15103868	Let's see.
15109703	15115970	There's a lot that you take for granted with doing something for as long as we've done it.
15116770	15137652	It's always, it's hard to, especially when you're at the precipice of doing something different, it's hard to not be scared for the future when you're, like I said, we've been doing this for 23 and a half years.
15138425	15167453	and it is gonna be it's gonna be an adjustment but I'm very hopeful and looking forward to what that ends up being but really I mean I don't think I say it enough but really thankful to all of the listeners those in the podcast those who come here every week live really appreciate you guys really appreciate you being here being a part of our lives for this song
15168614	15171997	It's just... It's been holding back all these emotions.
15172118	15177783	Well, not even holding back, but trying to stave off all this stuff for the entire episode.
15178744	15184210	It's been rough, but... No, I... I really appreciate it.
15184350	15187413	And it's been so nice to hear how we've impacted other people.
15187873	15190716	Honestly, a lot of times I don't really consciously think about that.
15191877	15197423	And it's just nice to know that we have that kind of meeting for people, because...
15197825	15226515	I don't know, sometimes you don't really feel that so I love you guys
15229550	15232258	I am going to leave someone out of this, but I'm going to try anyway.
15234003	15241586	Thank you first and foremost to my co-hosts Jamie and Matt for doing this for 23 and a half years.
15241606	15244234	No one else has done it this long together.
15244872	15247455	I have missed this being in person, but I get it.
15247875	15249657	COVID screwed everything up.
15249677	15253962	But I hope we will be able to get together like we did when we saw Clue last week.
15255503	15260428	Post DDR mozzarella sticks, road trips to Svigel once in a while would be incredible.
15261429	15265694	I truly want nothing but success for you both in your future projects.
15265714	15272601	And I know I will never say never to getting the band back together if something very special necessitates it.
15274066	15287326	Thank you to VXJasonXV, the fifth co-host of this show, after the chatroom, for the technical and the hosting help for many years, and for the dedication to do voiceovers every week.
15287346	15291833	This show would not have survived this long without Jason's support.
15291993	15293155	That is facts.
15294755	15296598	Thank you to Bobby Blackwolf.
15296618	15297920	He says he's the opening act.
15297940	15299483	I like to think you have his co-headliner.
15299503	15301486	You've said that already.
15301506	15305754	Thank you for finding our show and being with us on this journey that brought us to VOG.
15305994	15310001	I personally appreciate our professional journeys running on parallel tracks.
15310021	15314168	You have been an excellent business collaborator for something like 20 of these 23 years.
15314989	15316732	I need everyone to support Bobby.
15316752	15320138	He's going to be flying solo for a bit, but not forever.
15321552	15330124	Thank you to Scott Rubin, Derek H, and everyone that was a part of All Games Radio for allowing us to lift up each other's communities when we needed it.
15330966	15343864	All Games was such an important milestone on our journey, and my favorite E3 is always going to be the one where we all got together at the arena to do live broadcasts and shows, even if I know someone lost a lot of money on that.
15345397	15350390	Thank you to all of the other shows on the Voice of Geeks Network in addition to Bobby that continue to pave the way.
15350971	15353658	British Invaders, GameBee.org, Anime Jam Session.
15353678	15355843	Thank you to the contributors in the past as well.
15355864	15358510	Yes, that would include Starboard Power Coupling.
15358530	15360636	It's a real pleasure to work with grown-ups.
15361257	15362781	I know that sounds rude.
15362761	15376823	I'm really glad everyone has been on board with this vision of doing the thing and being professional about it and including as many voices as possible that want to come along for the ride.
15377645	15381431	And I look forward to seeing how I can contribute in a different way to VOG in the future.
15382773	15389123	Thank you, of course, to my pod daddy, Travis Donovan, for showing me that any idiot could podcast.
15390757	15395789	in all seriousness, we have never hidden that this show was a spinoff of Sorts of Under Sedation Live.
15396411	15405353	And while the show we are now is a very different format from where we started, USL set a large part of that template to get us started.
15405373	15407398	And on a personal note with Travis,
15407378	15431698	I also have to thank Travis in large part for connecting me with DragonCon.
15431678	15435183	If he's not here, it's probably a big part of why.
15435763	15438527	I do hope the recovery is going well, Travis.
15439288	15447799	From those days, I want to acknowledge and thank Jessica Harper, Evan, Jenna, and the other key players in those number one reality radio years.
15448620	15454548	Good luck and continued success to all of the other gaming podcasters out there, especially those that look to lift each other up.
15454849	15459795	I have really enjoyed getting to know so many different kinds of broadcasters from this little hobby.
15461378	15466466	It would seem weird not to thank video game makers in all of this.
15466546	15474839	Like there is a distinct lack of thank yous online to the people that work hard to make fun fucking video games.
15474859	15487318	So please let me give a heartfelt thank you to the people on the front lines battling an industry that does not always have their, in fact, often doesn't have their best interests first for creating incredible art.
15487805	15511973	Thank you for being here from episode one.
15512105	15512746	YYR.
15513428	15514089	Thank you for the games.
15514971	15519962	And Ranma, I think you're probably the most frequent caller ever and you've contributed a lot with video work over the years.
15520162	15522808	So thank you.
15522828	15525574	On some personal notes, I'm not done yet.
15526313	15530197	I want to thank all my friends I've sucked into coming on this program over the years.
15530758	15535503	From my roommate Brian that let this show take over his grandma's old home in 2002.
15535543	15539587	To my roommate Johnny that let it take over the garage.
15539607	15542070	To when Extifer and I were roomies.
15542090	15548277	To my friends at Konami that helped legitimize this show, in a way, with E3 2004.
15548857	15552321	To everyone that supported this project in some way, thank you.
15558494	15559555	I knew this would be the part.
15567607	15570451	And now I'm choking.
15570471	15570971	Stop it.
15571052	15572393	Water goes down that pipe.
15572473	15572814	Hold on.
15576319	15577300	Intentional silence.
15577480	15578001	It's a good thing.
15578842	15580605	I'm trying not to get lipstick on Sonic.
15581947	15586493	And of course, a special shout out to the best guest we ever had on this program.
15594910	15600159	My mother, especially that episode where she commented on Mortal Kombat 9.
15603705	15605067	I'm glad I got to meet your mom.
15607952	15611497	Fuck.
15611518	15612319	Ooh, January 1979.
15612960	15614843	January 1979.
15615785	15639801	Thank you.
15640220	15650004	Thank you to my current boss Carol for being a listener and not telling the rest of the team how often I say fuck on the internet and making it literally impossible for me to quit podcasting altogether.
15651588	15656119	I know it's cliche but from the bottom of my heart thank you to all of you in the community.
15657382	15660106	You have been the lifeblood of this show for so many years.
15660587	15663732	Everyone who has ever reached out to send some love, thank you.
15664373	15672206	It's a surreal thing to be able to show up at any city in the nation and likely know somebody here, there, thanks to the podcast.
15672226	15678917	And the stories I could share about some of those visits, but maybe if I ever write the book.
15680315	15709056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
15710825	15713809	Help some of you in your journey to be your most authentic self.
15714871	15722983	And I really... I really can't put into words how meaningful this has been to me.
15724585	15725286	Fucking look at me.
15726187	15728070	And made all the work.
15728090	15731195	At nights, I was really low on spoons.
15731215	15738385	But pushed myself to work that puss and do the show anyway worth it.
15739124	15767562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
15767963	15773450	This show has taken over your life as well as mine, and we've had to carve out our Sundays for many years.
15773470	15781840	And without getting too sappy disgusting, I am very lucky to have a husband that has put up with all of this for the entirety of our relationship.
15786906	15789510	Anything else, then?
15789530	15791092	To Dan, as well.
15792033	15792934	Yeah, Nelly.
15794336	15797059	Yeah, and I mean...
15798507	15808599	I have many words that I can't make right now because of reasons.
15808740	15813305	I'm a little overwhelmed.
15813325	15814447	Damn it, Slag Kick.
15815588	15821275	And I tried, you guys, but my kids didn't want to take over the show, so I'm sorry.
15822096	15822777	Well, there's...
15825828	15831238	You know, every time DarkTesia says fucking Joga, I'm thinking of Bjork instead.
15831799	15832601	I just think of Bjork.
15833222	15835927	Which is a great song in her discography.
15835947	15837430	It is actually my favorite Bjork song.
15838572	15842860	Alright.
15844784	15847870	I don't think that things have sunk in
15849419	15851301	that we're not doing this next week.
15851321	15860652	And I think that's kind of why I planned the marathon next week as well, to distract myself from the fact that we're not doing this next week.
15861493	15863855	Does that make sense?
15863875	15865677	No, I'm definitely on board with that.
15867079	15873486	But what's the phrase, so long and thanks for all the fish?
15876672	15881860	Alright, I have one thing left that I'm going to read and then I'm going to roll the credits.
15881880	15882621	You better work!
15884343	15885545	I'm kidding.
15885565	15895720	But before I say this last bit here, I know there's a lot of sad, I know there's a lot of emotion, I know there's a lot of like, but like, there's a lot of celebration too.
15896120	15898043	We did the damn thing.
15898063	15902910	And a lot of this has been motivated out of spite for people that said we couldn't.
15904793	15905734	I told you.
15906085	15935805	but we set a record together the three of us and all of you along for the ride and that's that's just something not everybody's going to get to experience in life with that to everyone including those I forgot thank you so much for making room for our show in your life whether it's been the past month
15936275	15937616	or the past 23 years.
15939459	15942442	And while the show is done, the vision continues.
15943683	15946987	Video games are fun, goddammit.
15947007	15952433	Stop fighting about them online and have a seat at the diner table.
15952453	15956057	Ingest some carbs and talk about your shared passion.
15956077	15962524	This is a hobby that can really bring people together as it has for us all of these years.
15962544	15966248	Thank you for letting us share our fandom together at this table.
15967274	15972906	But for now, the restaurant is closed for the night and the waitstaff wants to go home.
15973928	15979299	It's time to put those mozzarella sticks in a to-go box, get in the car, and go home.
15981022	15982726	Drive safe.
15982746	15983046	Good night.
15984008	15984670	Good night, everyone.
15985431	15985772	Good night.
