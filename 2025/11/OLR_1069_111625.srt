1
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:14,374
[SPEAKER_04]: While I was reading the news this week, I didn't understand why there was confusion around Ubisoft's financial situation.

2
00:00:14,654 --> 00:00:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely private equity buyouts with unscrupulous fools are going to hit some snags.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I realized I was thinking about Electronic Arts, and not the other troublesome warts of the gaming industry, of which there are many.

4
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:26,053
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see how I thought of the wrong company here, right?

5
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,598
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the penultimate intro.

6
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:34,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jimmy Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:42,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:47,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:50,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:56,464
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live once again with episode number 1069.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

13
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:13,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

14
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:19,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week will be OLR, the final, just so that we can actually go out on episode number 1069.

15
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:25,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be clear on how that's all going to work because numbers and LOL, I'm 12.

16
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Rob Roberts, your resident 12-year-old.

17
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,970
[SPEAKER_07]: And joining me as always are my incredible co-hosts.

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:34,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo.

20
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:35,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, hello.

21
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nice to hang IRL this week.

22
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:39,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely was.

23
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:40,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great time.

24
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:44,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so tell the listeners what we did, for those that don't know.

25
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:47,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to see Clue, and y'all didn't get to go.

26
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,769
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite movie of all time.

27
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be clear, my favorite movie of all time.

28
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:55,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Up there is one of my favorites.

29
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:57,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not The Princess Bride, but it's close.

30
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing too, people assume it's because of Rocky Horror and some connection there.

31
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:05,230
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had no idea what Rocky Horror was.

32
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,172
[SPEAKER_07]: My connection is childhood.

33
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Clue on beta.

34
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:13,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm that old and that movie is that old, right?

35
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I had Clue on beta when I was seven years old.

36
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:20,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you I watched it every single day.

37
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:29,863
[SPEAKER_07]: One Summer when I was seven years old because I was just obsessed with Tim Curry's performance in that movie and how like just an incredible actor he is.

38
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I always loved that man growing up.

39
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Annie was one of my favorite movies and of course he's in that.

40
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:42,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe not so much it until I was older and could appreciate that role because it was kind of scary as fuck.

41
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,562
[SPEAKER_07]: But like everything I saw him in, I just loved him in.

42
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:48,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Rocky Horror happened and I was like, oh my –

43
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Can this man do anything wrong?

44
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

45
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,731
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he absolutely can't.

46
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a recent interview with him that I saw a clip of on TikTok.

47
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:02,101
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody was trying to ask the question, was there ever a love that got away?

48
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,663
[SPEAKER_07]: They're basically begging him to come out on camera, right?

49
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's maintaining a private life.

50
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:12,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he speaks a little slower now and a little more intentionally ever since the stroke.

51
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:17,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And he says, without skipping a beat, without cracking a smile or anything, he says, Miss Piggy.

52
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:23,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, I love that man.

53
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:24,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I love him.

54
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:52,639
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway all right um let's say hello oh god he's a legend he is i'm glad we got to do i'm also glad to hear that our local classic theater the crest we have a few in town because the colonial where i do a lot of shows is a classic to the tower theater which ladybird made famous does a lot of movies too um i that was a fun to do a movie night so um we'll have to we'll have to do that once a month or so i think that'll be a lot of fun depending on what they show but you know they

00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:53,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

56
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems like they had some pretty good choices coming.

57
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,782
[SPEAKER_07]: They did Labyrinth earlier this month, which I missed.

58
00:03:57,243 --> 00:03:58,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam's Family Values.

59
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever's picking the movies there is doing a pretty good job.

60
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,607
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that lady.

61
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:02,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

62
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Who came out on stage.

63
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when I had to go potty.

64
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So I missed most of her shtick.

65
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,494
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, no, it's fine.

66
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:08,975
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

67
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:14,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's say hello to someone I didn't go on a movie date with this week, but maybe I will in the future.

68
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

69
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:16,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

70
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:19,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to go see Wicked for Good and Cry Together?

71
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:20,668
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

72
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:46,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'll see it, I'm just like, I don't know, it is alright I've seen Wicked as the play, you know, but I've never seen the stage play, I know of it, I've, you know, kind of heard the soundtrack So what I have learned, and I did a little bit of digging, is that a lot was taken out of the play and a lot more from the book was added back in Yeah, so, yeah Which makes me happy, that's why I'll see it

73
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:56,273
[SPEAKER_07]: No, PodCulture, I never... For as long as it previewed at the Orpheum in San Francisco, which is kind of where, you know, I have to go to see a lot of theater, I never got preview tickets.

74
00:04:56,293 --> 00:04:58,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It was always expensive and full.

75
00:04:58,137 --> 00:05:03,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, comments from our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live...

76
00:05:03,528 --> 00:05:07,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Just about every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

77
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:11,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for at least one more week at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

78
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:16,588
[SPEAKER_07]: But in all seriousness, DarkSakura has talked about that there will be a successor show coming to OLR.

79
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,835
[SPEAKER_07]: More details, all the details you need to know next week, right, on that.

80
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So stay tuned for that.

81
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed so.

82
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:27,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might want to make this time slot a habit.

83
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:37,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, with our final show next week on 23 November, of course, we really want you to continue to support all of our shows at the Voice Geeks Network.

84
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:42,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm taking the rest of the year off to rest, as I badly need to do.

85
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,588
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will be back.

86
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,870
[SPEAKER_07]: as an individual contributor to the Voice Geeks Network.

87
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm gonna focus on like YouTubes and TikToks and sort of short video production that works a little more with as I can fit, as I can do them with my schedule sort of thing.

88
00:05:57,581 --> 00:05:59,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm excited to continue that.

89
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:06,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, please continue to support the Voice Geeks Network even with our show wrapping up next week.

90
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,474
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope all of our listeners past and present will be able to join us live.

91
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:13,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's November 23rd for OLR, the final.

92
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:17,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Other comments from chat, Mish talking about Tim Curry is saying, wait, he was in Annie?

93
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:19,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, who was he?

94
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

95
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he was Rooster.

96
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,130
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays Miss Hannigan's brother.

97
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy street.

98
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:29,499
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the big number that Tim Curry is in.

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, interesting, there's a whole thing online about it.

100
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:39,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They filmed and spent a lot of money on a huge production for that number.

101
00:06:39,293 --> 00:07:06,718
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:11,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil of Nine says, don't forget his role in Legend.

103
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I won't, but I missed that when I was a kid.

104
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I want to say Jamie showed me that movie.

105
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I will not watch it

106
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:20,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass a certain point.

107
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Who showed me that movie?

108
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was you.

109
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:26,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you just turned around during that part or something, but I thought it was you.

110
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have absolutely told you about it.

111
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:30,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so anyway.

112
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Tiger Class says he was in a scary movie too.

113
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:36,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, Home Alone 2 as well was a big infamous role.

114
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he was.

115
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the concierge in Home Alone 2, yeah.

116
00:07:39,503 --> 00:08:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

117
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:13,898
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

118
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:20,349
[SPEAKER_07]: If a rumor we're going to get into later in the show pans out to be true next week, we will absolutely talk about that.

119
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,013
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, I expect the gaming news to be very light next week.

120
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:27,700
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to make it about us, because after 23 and a half years, we fucking deserve to.

121
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be doing that.

122
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:31,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll still touch on a little bit of gaming next week.

123
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:38,416
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to mention, Loki, playing behind you tonight, ZZT, one of my all-time faves.

124
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,638
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good.

125
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:41,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you played ZZT recently, Loki?

126
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:42,282
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

127
00:08:43,240 --> 00:09:07,273
[SPEAKER_06]: is that is that on the Epic Game Store they should really if it's not on the Epic Game Store they should really get it on there I mean yeah I don't think so because I would have bought it if it was on the Epic Game Store yeah you would think you would think tap into that history a little bit so yeah I mean come on like what like what's the uh like anniversary of ZZT by now it's like uh like

128
00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:10,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was out, what, 92 or 93?

129
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it high school for me or junior high?

130
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say it was early high school.

131
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,266
[SPEAKER_06]: It was high school for me.

132
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:22,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to say like 94, 95.

133
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So that game ought to be coming up on 30 years.

134
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if it was 95, it would be 30 years old.

135
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:44,010
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

136
00:09:43,990 --> 00:10:04,530
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Valve is releasing more hardware.

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,706
[SPEAKER_06]: They have announced a brand new Steam machine.

139
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like the Ouya, but actually a functional device.

140
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:26,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a small little 6x6 cube, and it's got enough hardware to basically...

141
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:37,324
[SPEAKER_06]: or enough processing power and GPU power to run most games at 4K 60 FPS with FSR, of course.

142
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,808
[SPEAKER_07]: The name that Bobby was using was the Gabe Cube.

143
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:40,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that name.

144
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:41,530
[SPEAKER_06]: The Gabe Cube.

145
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,632
[SPEAKER_06]: The Gabe Cube.

146
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:43,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabe Cube's good.

147
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:46,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs a loading screen.

148
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,722
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a cool little LED bar.

149
00:10:48,862 --> 00:10:50,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I really like the design of it.

150
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:54,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really cool because consoles are getting huge.

151
00:10:54,912 --> 00:11:02,766
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the PlayStations and stuff like that are pretty large devices, and they have this tiny little device that...

152
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,966
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I could actually see that, you know, you put that in your living room or under your TV.

153
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:11,053
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's got a cool little LED thing on there that you can control different stuff.

154
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of cool.

155
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:24,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, right now they're saying that it's got basically either... There's two different versions you can buy, either a 512 gigabyte or 2 terabyte storage capacity version.

156
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:29,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I believe that, you know, that's all just standard...

157
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:46,489
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

158
00:11:46,469 --> 00:12:11,852
[SPEAKER_06]: uh yeah and then along with that um they have uh support for you know Steam's brand new controller that they announced as well so there's a new Steam controller looks very similar as far as button layout setup to like a PlayStation controller but it also has the little trackpads below the analog sticks and then there's mappable buttons on the bottom as well or triggers and um

159
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,025
[SPEAKER_06]: They've also got different feedback as well.

160
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:23,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new magnetic thumbsticks that are supposed to be even more responsive and better than the Halifax sticks.

161
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

162
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, a new VR headset, the Steam Frame.

163
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:37,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a brand new headset that is along the lines of... I believe they said that it's going to...

164
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:53,128
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

165
00:12:53,108 --> 00:13:16,247
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

166
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty cool.

167
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:20,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Problem right now is we don't know any of the prices on any of this stuff.

168
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:22,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the only downside.

169
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,682
[SPEAKER_06]: All this is expected to be out sometime early next year.

170
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty exciting though.

171
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a lot to digest with all of this, right?

172
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:36,316
[SPEAKER_07]: So first off on the price, completely understand why they're not saying the price right now because it's too volatile right now.

173
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also a PC and not necessarily like a console.

174
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,185
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, I mean, you can use this for a PC.

175
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,787
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to...

176
00:13:43,767 --> 00:14:02,417
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

177
00:14:02,397 --> 00:14:30,987
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

178
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:48,165
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got you've got a device let's say this is even let's say is price exactly the same as like a PlayStation 5 or a you know Xbox Series X or whatever let's just say it's it's the same price as that which I think it's still going to be more than that because it's it's a PC but let's just say it's the same

179
00:14:48,145 --> 00:15:05,074
[SPEAKER_06]: you have access to a library of games which not only just a library games you have access to steam you have access to all the other pc marketplaces out there because you're not just tied down to one thing all in a form factor that is a tiny little box

180
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:21,763
[SPEAKER_06]: you've got a controller that feels very familiar with any other consoles out there and the best part about that is hey you know all those Microsoft exclusives and all those Sony exclusives well a lot of those seem to funnel the PC anyway so guess what it doesn't matter because you have both and you have everything else on top of that

181
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:33,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That built-in cross-buy is huge because let's say you have a Gabe Cube and you have your PC or even your Macs or your Linux running machine.

182
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,004
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a Steam Deck.

183
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Cross-buy isn't even a question.

184
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:41,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You buy the game, you're going to be able to play it on all of those devices.

185
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so smart of Steam's design.

186
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:56,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, if Microsoft does not have cross-buy as the default for everything, including third-party, starting by the end of the year, they're set up for failure.

187
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:01,236
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to make buying on this GameCube a whole lot more compelling.

188
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:03,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, like...

189
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:17,063
[SPEAKER_06]: you can even just like say hey look at this like yeah we are more expensive but guess what you don't gotta pay you don't have to pay monthly to use fucking online to play network play you can just do it it's free like

190
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:25,134
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, even if it undercuts the Xbox Series X, Microsoft will still put out a new console to promote their studios and Game Pass.

191
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:33,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do have software on other platforms and they have Xbox Gaming on other devices and platforms, but how does that look if they can't show it on their own hardware?

192
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,527
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they will always have a new console.

193
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:45,700
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is, I get that, and they are committed to putting out a new console, but the problem is, if they can't put it out at a price that's cheaper than this other box, why would anyone buy it?

194
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,350
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, other than Microsoft diehard fanboys and fangirls and fanpeople, why on earth would anyone buy it?

195
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Steam is, and I say this as someone who's had Game Pass for a very long time, almost since the beginning.

196
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I've supported the Microsoft ecosystem for a long time.

197
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:04,167
[SPEAKER_07]: I have seen them over the last couple of years going down the wrong path.

198
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:06,270
[SPEAKER_07]: They are in trouble, big time.

199
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:11,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And this whole report about the forced profits they have to be turning is absolutely the wrong direction.

200
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's going on?

201
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:15,484
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lot of anti-Microsoft sentiment out there.

202
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:15,965
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot.

203
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:17,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what it boils down to?

204
00:17:17,908 --> 00:17:18,329
[SPEAKER_07]: AI.

205
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It boils down to AI.

206
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,096
[SPEAKER_07]: You want co-pilot in your games?

207
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:23,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck out of here.

208
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop shoving that shit in our faces.

209
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:32,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, you can have it as a little icon, and when I want to invoke it, I will.

210
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But you've got to stop shoving that everywhere.

211
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more annoying than Clippy at this point.

212
00:17:38,144 --> 00:18:06,902
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

213
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in the last couple weeks.

214
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:12,772
[SPEAKER_07]: The ship is sinking at Microsoft.

215
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry to be that gamer.

216
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of you are fans of Microsoft.

217
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm rooting for them.

218
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I really am.

219
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:19,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a hater.

220
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:19,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise.

221
00:18:20,084 --> 00:18:24,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I am just seeing bad executive decision after bad executive decision.

222
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:28,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And even the diehard Microsoft fans have to admit, take a step back.

223
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,961
[SPEAKER_07]: You're seeing bad decisions too.

224
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:30,662
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it.

225
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:39,606
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is the fire Microsoft needs under their butt to make some fucking changes, then I welcome it.

226
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at the end of the day, I am rooting for Microsoft.

227
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:44,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see them succeed.

228
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:47,801
[SPEAKER_07]: They ain't going to succeed down this path.

229
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,766
[SPEAKER_07]: PopCulture says, I thought Loki was the one who does the rants.

230
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:51,448
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

231
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a few in me before the curtain falls.

232
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:55,435
Yes.

233
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:01,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, SJ100Matt says, I don't think it will undercut it, and I don't think it needs to.

234
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if it's close, then it will do well.

235
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,800
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a huge, important thing.

236
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,787
[SPEAKER_07]: All of this, if that Gabe Cube is $1,000, forget it.

237
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget everything I said.

238
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:11,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

239
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:12,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too expensive.

240
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:13,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's still a PC.

241
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:22,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even too expensive at $1,000, I think, actually, because it's a PC, because it's not just a console, and it is something that...

242
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,673
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

243
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:27,175
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

244
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:47,005
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

245
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:54,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think you can make the argument though, like even if it's like a couple hundred dollars more, it's like, yeah, but you're not paying for online access.

246
00:19:54,745 --> 00:20:01,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point, it becomes a boutique product and a niche thing, which is still great for a lot of people.

247
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:05,685
[SPEAKER_07]: But everything I said about, oh, Microsoft's in danger, girl, that's out the window.

248
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:24,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm saying is I reserve the right to take back everything I said because the price is that important.

249
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:42,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

250
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, JK, JK, you know what?

251
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It turns out maybe it was a bad idea to put tariffs on bananas and coffee and meat, whatever the fuck they said.

252
00:20:51,438 --> 00:20:57,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of things at the grocery store, because remember how the price of groceries was going to come down on day one?

253
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:03,768
[SPEAKER_06]: and... I did want to pivot real fast.

254
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:04,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

255
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:05,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

256
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just ever so quickly.

257
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, because I got more, so you better hurry.

258
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:09,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

259
00:21:10,298 --> 00:21:11,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Sprinkle in a little bit of good news, okay?

260
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

261
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:16,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I finally got... I had to update stupid Epic Games Store.

262
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:21,314
[SPEAKER_06]: ZZT is on their store and it's free.

263
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,277
[SPEAKER_06]: What?!

264
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:24,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that is good news.

265
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,201
[SPEAKER_07]: That is good news.

266
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:26,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

267
00:21:26,862 --> 00:21:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Rant cancelled.

268
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:28,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Show over.

269
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:29,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Go play ZZT.

270
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:29,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

271
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:29,687
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

272
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:30,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

273
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,914
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is going to say about politics?

274
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know.

275
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,810
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to cringe when I bring this up.

276
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:39,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't give a fuck.

277
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:42,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one put out the door.

278
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to say it all tonight.

279
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:50,766
[SPEAKER_07]: The tariffs are completely going to be controlled by this Epstein Files situation.

280
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:54,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the whole reason that the tariffs... Why now?

281
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:55,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are the tariffs going down now?

282
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:57,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Distraction!

283
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Look over here!

284
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Look over here, because the Epstein Files, it's all a hoax.

285
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:05,088
[SPEAKER_07]: All that man can keep saying is it's all a hoax.

286
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,190
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a hoax...

287
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:35,603
[SPEAKER_07]: and everybody just needs to keep coming back to the same point which I can't fucking believe Marjorie Taylor Greene of all people you know what, when it's right, it's right and that woman is right on this if there's nothing if it's a hoax then the file should be released let it be shown that it's a hoax let it be out there, let everybody see it what's the problem?

288
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:42,859
[SPEAKER_07]: But at every fucking opportunity, he's wanting to distract, distract, distract.

289
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the clues have been there.

290
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:47,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all lined up.

291
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:49,768
[SPEAKER_07]: What does this have to do with video games?

292
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The price of what you're going to pay for a Gabe Cube.

293
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:57,678
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the Epstein files have to do with video games.

294
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:05,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if those come out and the house of cards starts tumbling, those tariffs are going to go away one way or another real fast.

295
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:15,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not that I really want to see that that's the ending, but unfortunately, I think we all know it's coming.

296
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:17,801
[SPEAKER_07]: That that man was more involved.

297
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:31,153
[SPEAKER_07]: That the man who is on tape saying, grab them by the pussy, and the man who is on tape making fun of different abled people in all sorts of forms and stuff, and the man who has said all these brass things.

298
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:34,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

299
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:37,787
[SPEAKER_07]: All I can say is it's on my conscience I didn't vote for him.

300
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:44,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Video games.

301
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:46,944
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's true.

302
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody agree with me.

303
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody agree with me.

304
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,895
[SPEAKER_07]: The Epstein files have everything to do with video games right now.

305
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:54,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me I'm wrong.

306
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he's going to get rid of tariffs to distract from that.

307
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,741
[SPEAKER_06]: He's just going to do more insane stuff.

308
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:02,964
[SPEAKER_03]: He just did!

309
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:07,892
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem, though, is that regardless of whether or not any of us voted for him, we still have to deal with his bullshit.

310
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:08,633
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

311
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,677
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.

312
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:12,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

313
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:14,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt does have a good point.

314
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,127
[SPEAKER_07]: The court might also fix the tariff thing.

315
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

316
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of you were like, why did you have to go down that road?

317
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:27,281
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do because this is why things don't make sense anymore.

318
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:38,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just don't get prices up front because nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen tomorrow and what side of the bed Dear Leader wakes up on and decides to start shit somewhere on social media.

319
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:50,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, though, if anyone's paying attention to the current state of this creature, I don't know if he's going to make it through the end of next year.

320
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:57,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, if it's a hoax, then let the people be the judge.

321
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:02,905
[SPEAKER_07]: But at every opportunity you're hiding it, the jig is up.

322
00:25:04,775 --> 00:25:29,112
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway um what else uh oh what else oh yes Valve VR oh yes and let's yeah it's a VR yeah that was cool too yeah uh big rumor in that department too right uh yeah well it would yeah so now the other rumor is and it's it's like everyone has to like just go really we're doing this again but yes we're doing it again

323
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:34,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, November 19th is the 27th anniversary of Half-Life 1.

324
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we just had the anniversary of Half-Life 2.

325
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:43,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently, many leakers are all saying the same thing.

326
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:44,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Many leakers!

327
00:25:44,739 --> 00:25:45,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Handle it!

328
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So, many leakers, one of which is Tyler McVicker, who was the first to leak that Half-Life Alex was a thing, says that there's an announcement coming.

329
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:20,243
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

330
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:23,929
[SPEAKER_07]: is because the VR thing.

331
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, VR, I don't know.

332
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:34,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And folks are probably going to disagree with me, but I feel like there have not been a lot of compelling reasons to have a VR lately in the past few years.

333
00:26:35,317 --> 00:26:35,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Here and there.

334
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:38,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, Luminous Arise just came out this last week.

335
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, still.

336
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:55,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Ancient?

337
00:26:55,897 --> 00:27:08,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Half-Life Alyx at this point is pretty old There needs to be something new to breathe life into VR and make this device something you have to have to play this game

338
00:27:09,717 --> 00:27:29,886
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:38,711
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're pushing a console system of sorts too, a Half-Life 3, and maybe it's a medium.

340
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:50,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Half-Life 3, or whatever it is, ends up being something that is built for flat screens, but has a VR enhancement of some sort that will make people want to have it in VR as well.

341
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:51,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Like...

342
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:56,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes a really good flagship product for all of these things.

343
00:27:56,578 --> 00:28:02,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I'm a little more inclined to believe the rumors this time than previously.

344
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,231
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

345
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:10,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Either we get to drop this whopper news on our last show or fool me again, Gabe Newell.

346
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Fool me again.

347
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:18,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But it should be noted that they did announce three hardware things.

348
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:40,018
[SPEAKER_06]: 1, 2, 5 3

349
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, ushering in new eras is the hot new thing on the block.

350
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:52,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's move on and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

351
00:28:53,095 --> 00:29:01,403
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I'm loving the facts that S2100Matt's been posting on Blue Sky about the show, but S2100Matt says, OLR has three letters.

352
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:02,364
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR is ending.

353
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:04,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Game awards happening three weeks from now.

354
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Half-Life 3 confirmed.

355
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:08,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

356
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:11,153
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

357
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it wasn't the best, and I'll tell you why.

358
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have that issue going on with my hand.

359
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming really hurts.

360
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten so much worse.

361
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:29,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I have played a lot of Survivor and Dead by Daylight when I can, whenever I go back to Killer.

362
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's because I have my controls, most of my major controls, bound to my mouse.

363
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:37,375
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too much.

364
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:42,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I really can't make it through more than a couple of matches.

365
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:48,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been farming blood points as survivor, because, I mean, that's it.

366
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:53,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I am also, though, playing a lot of Palia, because I can play that.

367
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have picked up Date Everything.

368
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:02,601
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna see if that happens.

369
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:02,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

370
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:12,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I also am not quite sure what I want to do for a classic game, but Shay gave me an idea to do community games night.

371
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,508
[SPEAKER_03]: So there may be some community games starting on Saturday on my stream.

372
00:30:16,568 --> 00:30:17,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

373
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,192
[SPEAKER_03]: But mostly it's just been Palia and the Deborah.

374
00:30:21,573 --> 00:30:21,874
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

375
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:26,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Pirate Poundtown does say DVD streams are still fun to watch as a lurker.

376
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like lurking in those types of streams too.

377
00:30:30,343 --> 00:30:31,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to watch.

378
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:32,185
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

379
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:34,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

380
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically just Minecraft.

381
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:42,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been still working on getting my modded series ready to go.

382
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:54,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Also finished and put out a new episode where I made a Minecraft super smelter that makes fart noises because farts are funny.

383
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:54,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

384
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:57,446
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's functional and it works really well.

385
00:30:57,546 --> 00:31:00,250
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also is really funny because it makes lots of fart noises.

386
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:29,241
[SPEAKER_07]: 29 curated fart noises by the way lovely love that for you love that journey all right yes yes um let's see my gaming week um my gaming week was I did I finished off Diablo 4 season 10 like I said I would I've I finished off all the little achievements for the season and all that stuff and that's the first time I've cleared it completely so very proud of that and then what did I do after that I was like I wonder what's going on in Diablo 3 these days and

387
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:52,410
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I talked about it a little bit at length at the end of Bobby's show this week, so you can kind of go over there and check that out.

389
00:31:57,397 --> 00:32:03,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just say in a nutshell, I think Digital Eclipse did the best job they could with the stuff they had.

390
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:05,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a worthy thing to check out, right?

391
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only do you have a pretty great collection, and I understand Network has been having a lot of issues.

392
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a patch go out this week, but I'm just keeping it real.

393
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have an interest in playing this game online with strangers.

394
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:17,605
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't touched the online features.

395
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:25,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But I spent hours and hours on the original Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 2 on the Super Nintendo.

396
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:29,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I'm aware that Mortal Kombat Super Nintendo played a little differently.

397
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:34,983
[SPEAKER_07]: But when that's the version you know, you know, it's kind of like, it's neat to kind of go back to that a little bit.

398
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:36,865
[SPEAKER_07]: They do talk about that in the documentary.

399
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:42,511
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very upfront in talking about that the Super Nintendo version was a little bit slower and sort of had the reputation for having the better graphics.

400
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So it

401
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:48,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It was interesting to see the things that they weren't afraid to talk about and be a little bit critical of.

402
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,761
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one would be Mortal Kombat 4's reception.

403
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:57,469
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty well acknowledged that Mortal Kombat 4 laid the groundwork for the Mortal Kombat games that came later.

404
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:08,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I maybe wish the final video, instead of being half a recap video, I maybe wish the final video had gotten a little more into maybe talking to some of the modern Mortal Kombat team members.

405
00:33:09,263 --> 00:33:11,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have especially loved to see younger...

406
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:31,433
[SPEAKER_07]: and I even mean like 20 and 30 year olds working on Mortal Kombat today and what they get from the old games I think would have been a really nice sort of footnote to the whole thing as opposed to like it's like a half recap video it was fine but I just felt like that little piece was missing because of course at the end it goes and then Mortal Kombat 4 was released and then

407
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have the Game Boy games.

408
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance.

409
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we have Mortal Kombat Annihilation.

410
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of runs through the rest.

411
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:39,304
[SPEAKER_07]: But I get it.

412
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:41,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Those games are newer and they're not part of the collection.

413
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just have a little plaque and that's it.

414
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:50,780
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would have loved to see that come full circle about the real impact that that original trilogy had on the games.

415
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:59,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also very interesting the way they very quickly acknowledge and move on from Tobias leaving Midway when he did.

416
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:00,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

417
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:04,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was just kind of interesting to me as I was like, boy, they really quickly kind of mentioned that.

418
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:11,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand it's not about what he did after that, but you sort of get it.

419
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:20,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when you're watching it, you see a whole section on, they did Mortal Kombat, the live tour, they did Mortal Kombat action figures, they did Mortal Kombat, all this.

420
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:23,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're kind of like, how much money...

421
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was that making money for at the end of the day?

422
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it the four folks that created the game?

423
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:30,132
[SPEAKER_07]: The five that worked on the sequel?

424
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:31,935
[SPEAKER_07]: The seven that worked on three?

425
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:34,099
[SPEAKER_07]: How much money did Tobias ultimately make from that?

426
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of that was Ed Boon and his ideas.

427
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:41,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can see where at some point he probably got...

428
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

429
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,658
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of infers.

430
00:34:59,678 --> 00:35:03,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see the unofficial Mortal Kombat legacy.

431
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:11,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, Digital Eclipse has to keep it clean and has to keep everybody happy.

432
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:15,365
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they did the best job they possibly could with what they have access to.

433
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:19,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, yeah, I did notice they have two mocap performers.

434
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:22,757
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them, I think, still works for NetherRealm.

435
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:51,630
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

436
00:35:51,610 --> 00:36:16,707
[SPEAKER_07]: that uh Richard Divizno I think his name is I may be pronouncing that wrong he played Kano in the original I never realized he was the campy as fuck Quan Chi in the Sub-Zero mythologies and it's so funny to see that stuff now because you're like it's and I mean that in the best possible way I love camp so um seeing that now and the FMV from like Sub-Zero mythologies like it's

437
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:44,803
[SPEAKER_07]: the game is rough but it is if you just view it as what it is which is high fucking camp of the CD-ROM era I'm talking SimCity with live action news sequences spliced in CD-ROM era if you look at Sub-Zero Mythologies as that it's actually neat and I never realized how much crossover but it was a little weird to me that he being such a big part of the motion cap family

438
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:50,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Nowhere to be found other than acknowledgements and the videos that happen to have him in it.

439
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:55,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have tried to get an interview with him, and I'm sure they did, to Digital Eclipse's credit.

440
00:36:55,681 --> 00:37:03,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So just a bummer that I'm sure other reasons that are more Netherrealm or really going back to Midway Williams control.

441
00:37:04,737 --> 00:37:05,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

442
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, DarkSakura, I never knew this.

443
00:37:08,636 --> 00:37:09,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know this?

444
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve Ritchie, he's all over this documentary because he's the voice in Mortal Kombat 2.

445
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I never knew he was the voice.

446
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:16,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

447
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew that.

448
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:18,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it.

449
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:23,267
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done the voices when we were hanging out at a pinball party once.

450
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:25,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and is so iconic.

451
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:29,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat 2 had the best voiceovers of any Mortal Kombat game.

452
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:31,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Mortal Kombat 1, I think they say that Ed Boon did the voices in that.

453
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:34,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Steve Ritchie did him in 3?

454
00:37:34,705 --> 00:37:35,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

455
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: But 2, which is like the most iconic, he did the voices for that.

456
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I never realized that.

457
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:42,938
[SPEAKER_03]: As Sherlock points out, you'll hear it if you go...

458
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:45,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Black Knight from Black Knight 2000.

459
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:50,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was also, what's his face, the head in No Fear.

460
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:56,303
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a lot of the voices in a lot of the tables, but yeah, he did a lot of voices for Midway.

461
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:11,142
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who else is all over this documentary is they have a few podcast folks and, you know, folks that comment on pop, you know, video game culture just because, you know, they speak like what the community was at the time.

462
00:38:11,202 --> 00:38:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, oh, I saw this commercial on TV to try to, like, get that perspective sort of thing.

463
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:19,090
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those commenters, Cliffy B. You remember him?

464
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,293
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the guy that did Gears of War, right?

465
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, all I'm going to say is.

466
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:31,158
[SPEAKER_07]: You may remember, go back to the episode where the very first Karateka Gold Master Series came out.

467
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Mortal Kombat isn't an official Gold Master Series.

468
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:34,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back to the Karateka.

469
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:39,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, Ed Boon is randomly interviewed here.

470
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:45,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet they were getting recordings of him for a Mortal Kombat collection and asked him a few questions here.

471
00:38:45,845 --> 00:39:13,658
[SPEAKER_07]: so now we've got Cliffy B in this so I wonder I actually don't think it's Gears of War I wonder if a Jazz Jackrabbit collection is coming or specifically and I would love the shit out of this and if they're not doing it this is a reasonable one I would love to see them do an Apogee, early Apogee collection holy fuck Commander Keen, Jazz Jackrabbit, Jilla the Jungle a collection with that

472
00:39:13,638 --> 00:39:37,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love that and I think there's a lot of people that really missed that arrogance because they could even get into the fact that like BBSs were the reasons why those games were huge and I think there are so many people today that have no idea what the fuck a BBS even is like before the internet oh that'd be cool like if they had like a little like a BBS simulator like here's what it's like to be on a BBS they know what a BBL is okay

473
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:45,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, BravoCon is a different podcast, DarkSakura.

474
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:46,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

475
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:50,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, comments in chat.

476
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:53,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Sycoon says, what the hell is CliffyB up to now anyway?

477
00:39:53,748 --> 00:39:54,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, by the way.

478
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:00,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's more like an industry, like, not a commentator.

479
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:04,220
[SPEAKER_07]: The people you bring in to, what's the word?

480
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an easy word.

481
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:07,303
[SPEAKER_07]: You bring them in to tell you what you're doing wrong.

482
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Collaborator, not critic.

483
00:40:10,553 --> 00:40:10,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

484
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't I think consultant?

485
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:15,881
[SPEAKER_07]: My God, why is that word escaping me?

486
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:16,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Consultant.

487
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:18,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's a consultant in the industry now, pretty much.

488
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:30,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but that's, so that's my little, and I don't know if anyone from Digital Eclipse actually listens to this show, but if that idea wasn't on your radar, God, I hope it is.

489
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:36,791
[SPEAKER_07]: because that like an Apogee or even, you know, I think it might be asking a lot to get all of those games in one collection.

490
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:43,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if it is just a Jazz Jackrabbit or something that like gets into the BBS era, how those things trade, I would eat that shit up.

491
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be so into that.

492
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:46,443
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, but they do.

493
00:40:46,984 --> 00:40:47,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital's been doing great.

494
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:51,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been doing great work with these collections and museums and stuff.

495
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,697
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just I do hope they are financially motivated by the buyers to do more of it.

496
00:40:56,677 --> 00:41:22,836
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

497
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,852
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

498
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:27,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I never understood when we talked about reheating the nachos.

499
00:41:27,995 --> 00:41:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm borrowing that from what everybody said about Mayhem, the Lady Gaga album.

500
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, she's reheating her nachos.

501
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:38,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And I heard it again this week when the new Robin single came out, which is so fucking good, by the way.

502
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:38,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Dopamine.

503
00:41:39,189 --> 00:41:41,511
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was like, oh, there goes Robin reheating her nachos.

504
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:45,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like... Nachos are fucking good.

505
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And like...

506
00:41:47,268 --> 00:42:03,623
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

507
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:10,665
[SPEAKER_07]: All that to say, yes, Luminous Arise is just a different puzzle game.

508
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even want to say shoehorned.

509
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that's a negative term.

510
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:17,986
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's wrapped in the skin of Tetris Effect.

511
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:21,375
[SPEAKER_07]: And some are going to say, oh, it's just reheating Tetris Effect's nachos.

512
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Who fucking cares?

513
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:25,096
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is incredible.

514
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:26,399
[SPEAKER_02]: The heated nachos are still good.

515
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

516
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Nachos are fucking good.

517
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:34,676
[SPEAKER_07]: If you say that term, I'm going to slap your hand if you touch my nachos before eating a Chili's.

518
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:36,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to slap your damn hand.

519
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:39,145
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not get to use that term as a negative.

520
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

521
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm loving Luminous Arise.

522
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the music's pretty good.

523
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:52,998
[SPEAKER_07]: The visuals are really, I mean, they're almost like I said about the demo review, they're almost a little distracting sometimes.

524
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:54,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will say this.

525
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:58,951
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a very good job on the accessibility of that sort.

526
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,574
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slider for the visual effects.

527
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slider for the random zoom ins and outs.

528
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:05,818
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slider for this.

529
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:06,778
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slider for that.

530
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:17,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So like they made it very accessible where like if Luminous is going to give you, you know, like, ah, this is hard on my eyes or even, you know, I could possibly have a medical incident because of this game.

531
00:43:17,648 --> 00:43:19,890
[SPEAKER_07]: They gave you complete control over all that stuff.

532
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And they built Bobby Blackwolf mode into it.

533
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:23,914
[SPEAKER_07]: They said...

534
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:40,519
[SPEAKER_07]: here's a control so that you don't lose the game when you get to the top or the pieces don't even fucking fall like they built really easy accessibility into it that the demo did not represent so I would say that those sorts of features were really well done so

535
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:47,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Seegers in chat saying it does not rise to the levels of electronic symphony in terms of music quality, but it's still a really good game.

536
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it for what it is.

537
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:54,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like the music thing is just always going to be a debate that really relies on personal tastes a lot.

538
00:43:55,639 --> 00:44:02,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think as long as the music is good, like again, going back to the Lady Gaga example,

539
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:03,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you!

540
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:23,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you!

541
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:49,673
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a brand new mechanic it's similarly again it's the nachos from Tetris Effect so it's hitting the L2 to like freeze time for a little bit but this time in Luminous they call it a burst mechanic and it's really satisfying the way it kind of moves the other pieces around and then there's like a mode in the game where like you have these like this mode is giant pieces that you have to move around this mode is nothing but bursts they they did a lot of like

542
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Little fun modes for the game to try to mix it up a little bit.

543
00:44:54,114 --> 00:44:58,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, the game is strongest when you're just playing the game for what it's worth.

544
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching Bear Debonair play it last night.

545
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:02,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what'd you think?

546
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:07,833
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot busier than what I would have wanted, but it looks pretty fun.

547
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:13,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but now that you know there's sliders where you can turn that busyness down, hopefully it makes it a little more appealing.

548
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,562
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit more, yeah.

549
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:21,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a little bit worried about that after the demo, but then when I actually opened the game and I was like, oh shit, they got tons of sliders in this game for the different effects and stuff.

550
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:23,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, okay, they did that right.

551
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So good for them.

552
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:24,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for them.

553
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:28,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, if you're a puzzle game fan, highly recommend Luminous Arise.

554
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,485
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've never jumped into the series, I don't know if that demo is still available.

555
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:53,916
[SPEAKER_07]: but um I I'm pretty sure there's a demo there's gotta be like an online version of that game at some point I I check it out to see if you're into it I I I love Luminous as a puzzle you know if if Mizuguchi created that game because he couldn't port Tetris the first time the way he wanted to I think if he created something to be up there on the level with Tetris I think he

556
00:45:53,896 --> 00:46:17,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's done a damn good job I think it's it's hard to put anything on the same level as Tetris but he's he's up there he's in that conversation Luminous is absolutely one of the all-time puzzle great games and absolutely worth your time Meteos next please thank you because I fucking loved Meteos I want to see that game back I don't know how they'll do it when there isn't a but there's there is a touchscreen is there a touchscreen at the switch too no they got rid of that didn't they

557
00:46:18,095 --> 00:46:18,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

558
00:46:19,464 --> 00:46:20,995
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how they do medias.

559
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:24,358
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a version on Xbox 360 that used controller.

560
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you would have to keyboard mouse it.

561
00:46:28,636 --> 00:46:29,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's a way.

562
00:46:29,518 --> 00:46:32,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Seeger says it's still touchscreen.

563
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, I didn't know.

564
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:35,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how many games actually use it?

565
00:46:36,008 --> 00:46:42,358
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would love to see a Meteos that's like keyboard mouse or touchscreen on Switch 2.

566
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:44,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, Switch 2 has that mouse thing.

567
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:48,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see a Meteos game that uses the mouse.

568
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:50,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That would make me very, very, very, very happy.

569
00:46:50,191 --> 00:47:03,019
[SPEAKER_07]: so anyway that's it I've gone on long enough but you know Luminous is is really one of the all-time great puzzle games so it's really good to see a new entry in it this week um yeah all right let's get into some news Loki what's going on in the news

570
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft stuff um so there was a little bit of panic because Ubisoft had delayed their upcoming um quarterly earnings report uh basically saying and they also halted their trading because of it um it says Ubisoft announced the postponement and release of their first half of fiscal year 2025-2026 um

571
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:58,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares and its bonds and from the market opening of November 14th until the publication of its first half 2025-2026 results in the coming days Ubisoft will inform the market of the date at which trading can restart and they weren't really sure what the reason was for it people speculated a buyout or something like that but apparently it's just according to the CFO

572
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:27,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

573
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:53,550
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt with the perfect comment in our chat saying this could be a lot of nothing or a whole lot of something that covers the spectrum this might maybe possibly be something potentially that could be big or it might be little that's just corporate speak it might be big or it might be a nothing burger a big nothing burger

574
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:59,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, when I first read this, I'm going to be honest.

575
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:10,153
[SPEAKER_07]: My initial reaction was like, look, if Yves Guillemin's last day is also my last day, you're welcome, industry.

576
00:49:10,193 --> 00:49:10,954
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

577
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:11,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, game industry.

578
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:12,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, game industry.

579
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:13,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

580
00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: We have brought you the Half-Life 3.

581
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We have gotten rid of the Yves Guillemin.

582
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:20,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank us.

583
00:49:22,808 --> 00:49:52,309
[SPEAKER_07]: but I'm not getting my hopes up to that extent because part of me is kind of like are they going to also get acquired by one of those fucking companies that just comes in to just shit the bed with everything and lay people off and just like take a company yeah that's what I'm worried about at the end of the day is this is going to be one of those types of information I don't know I find myself playing fewer and fewer Ubisoft games I play one

584
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:56,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't play any at the moment right now because it's been a long time.

585
00:49:56,078 --> 00:50:01,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the last Ubisoft game I played was maybe Trackmania?

586
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:10,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep wanting to buy a Just Dance game so I have some exercise stuff and then I'm like, I don't know.

587
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:16,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I won one, but I mean, I still play Avatar because...

588
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think it's the best thing that they've put out.

589
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:21,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has remained updated.

590
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:24,457
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually been taking good care of the player base.

591
00:50:25,238 --> 00:50:26,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've kept playing it.

592
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:27,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Just buy a used copy.

593
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:31,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll go look for an old Just Dance on Switch.

594
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:32,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Switch 2 will play Switch 1 stuff.

595
00:50:33,307 --> 00:50:36,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So go find an old version and buy that.

596
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they're not making any more money.

597
00:50:37,211 --> 00:50:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, technically, if you want to think about it, they're not really making any money anyways when you buy it at retail because technically they've already been paid at that point.

598
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:48,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

599
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

600
00:50:49,278 --> 00:50:50,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a small drop in the bucket.

601
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

602
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:58,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not buying their Assassin's Creed games because I just don't like it and everything else they're doing is just not good.

603
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:00,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

604
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:05,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I said, the only thing good that they've put out at all has been the Avatar game.

605
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:10,111
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt says, or Rob, you can just dance.

606
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:10,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Jazz hands.

607
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:11,534
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

608
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:12,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, okay.

609
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:13,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny you say that.

610
00:51:13,818 --> 00:51:14,879
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready for another tangent?

611
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:22,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I fell down a rabbit hole on TikTok the other night and I got introduced to, I think it was called immersive workout videos.

612
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:48,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've seen these but it like I swear to god it's somebody took the idea for WarioWare and turned it into a workout video and what I mean is like it'll come up and it'll say uh crank or something like that so you put your hand up in the air and you do this this this this this and then the the YouTube video switches to an oven going on and off or a dial going left and right as you do it and then it'll be like lift and like do lifts like this

613
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:54,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the YouTube switches to you're lifting a very large thing up in the air like a pig up and down and up and down.

614
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:55,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.

615
00:51:55,273 --> 00:52:01,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was watching this, I was like, this is what Nintendo should be doing for the next WarioWare game.

616
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,847
[SPEAKER_07]: This immersive workout thing.

617
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:05,492
[SPEAKER_07]: This is 100% with the next WarioWare game.

618
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you...

619
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:10,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I'm dropping all the bombs on my way out.

620
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:20,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, Nintendo, you are leaving money on the table if you do not merge the icon that is Wario and a fitness game.

621
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:31,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine how fucking funny Wario and pals would be in a gym type of setting with this whole immersive workout trend, like actually being in a WarioWare type of game?

622
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:32,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be incredible.

623
00:52:33,243 --> 00:52:33,984
[SPEAKER_03]: That would do it.

624
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... I would love that.

625
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:40,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It took gamifying workouts to get a lot of people up and working.

626
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:42,799
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of what I'm doing now.

627
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,309
[SPEAKER_07]: When you think about Pikmin and Pokemon and Ingress, that's kind of why I fell down that.

628
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't talk about it every week during my gaming week, but believe I'm still playing the shit out of those games.

629
00:52:53,957 --> 00:52:56,041
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I don't play a lot of the other stuff.

630
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

631
00:52:57,543 --> 00:53:03,947
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of why I was going to see if you ever, you know, I had asked before if you ever wanted to go walking together because I want to try Pikmin out.

632
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:04,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to do it by myself.

633
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:06,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, let's go.

634
00:53:06,689 --> 00:53:07,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time before.

635
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:10,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm slow as hell with my hobbit legs.

636
00:53:10,415 --> 00:53:14,060
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that fucking sucks is that now it gets dark so early.

637
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,003
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, and I'm not walking in the morning.

638
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like so dark, right?

639
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:22,313
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has to be like a weekend basically or, you know, a day off.

640
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you could also, Rob, you could also join my adult ballet class.

641
00:53:29,403 --> 00:53:31,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's the right fit for me.

642
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,809
[SPEAKER_07]: You get your hobby.

643
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:35,271
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more guys in ballet.

644
00:53:36,893 --> 00:53:39,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys thinner than me and better in shape.

645
00:53:39,777 --> 00:53:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I do ballet and I am really not the ballet body.

646
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:46,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

647
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just get Loki to join me.

648
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you'll do it, right?

649
00:53:49,871 --> 00:53:53,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just recognize not everything is for me and that's okay.

650
00:53:53,736 --> 00:53:55,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Immersive workouts, that's for me.

651
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway,

652
00:53:59,795 --> 00:54:16,808
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

653
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did we get at the Sony State of Play?

00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a new trailer for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined that's going to come out on February 5th, 2026.

[SPEAKER_07]: We got an update on In Kobini, One Store, Many Stories.

656
00:54:29,705 --> 00:54:33,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a 1990s Japanese convenience store simulation.

657
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:34,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out April 2026.

658
00:54:35,835 --> 00:54:37,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Coffee Talk Tokyo.

659
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:39,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that indie game, the Coffee Talk games.

660
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:41,424
[SPEAKER_07]: They're making one that's Japan-centric.

661
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to come out on March 5th.

662

[SPEAKER_07]: Broken Lore, Unfollow, and Broken Lore Ascend.

663
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:48,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I must admit, I don't know much about these games.

664
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:52,880
[SPEAKER_07]: They're horror games, but they definitely look scary.

665
00:54:53,180 --> 00:55:00,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And I liked that one of the themes was like, we're going to go to the top of the tower to do a social media video and something up there is going to try to kill us.

666
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to look more into this series because I feel like I might be into these actually.

667
00:55:03,894 --> 00:55:05,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you all chat?

668
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:06,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I be playing Broken Lore?

669
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:11,584

671
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that literally means you're going to be playing your PlayStation for 24 hours, but that could be very interesting.

672
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume you could save as it goes, but we'll see.

673
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:42,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion Rec.

674
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:47,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an indie game where you record your movements and then you play them back at different parts of the stage.

675
00:55:48,084 --> 00:55:49,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting little kind of puzzling mechanic.

676
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:51,329

681
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:18,847
[SPEAKER_07]: DLC for What's Upon a Katamari, but it's music packs and Neo remixes, not stages.

682
00:56:18,887 --> 00:56:21,130
[SPEAKER_06]: All they've been doing is just music packs.

683
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

684
00:56:22,552 --> 00:56:26,297

00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They shadow dropped it.

[SPEAKER_07]: Super Monkey Ball characters coming on January 2026 Tangle and Whisper from the Sonic the Hedgehog comic series coming in February 2026 BlazBlue Entropy Effect X it's a roguelike game but you play as BlazBlue characters Nevergrave, The Witch and the Curse that game looked really cool to me I did watch this live by the way that game looked really cool to me it's a Metroidvania type of game it's out March next year

692
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:18,256
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of games they announced.

693
00:57:18,296 --> 00:57:19,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here.

694
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Octopath Traveler Zero, they got a new trailer for that.

695
00:57:23,368 --> 00:57:25,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Big update on Marvel Fighting Souls.

696
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:28,739
[SPEAKER_07]: A deep dive on Spider-Man and Ghost Rider were shown there.

697
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:33,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And a closed beta coming December 5th through 7th.

698
00:57:34,124 --> 00:57:42,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Elden Ring Night Rain, a game I've seen Alan playing a lot of lately, is having its first DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, coming out December 4th.

699
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,961
[SPEAKER_07]: New bosses, all that good stuff.

700
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:50,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sony is bringing out a new monitor, but it's only going to be released in Japan.

701
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,955
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a 27-inch monitor with a 1440p screen.

702
00:57:54,695 --> 00:58:01,723
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, the big, big, big announcement, a PlayStation 5 digital Japanese only edition.

703
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:13,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So taking a page from Nintendo's playbook, releasing a console that is only available for Japan and is, you know, Japanese language restricted and all that good stuff.

704
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:18,441
[SPEAKER_07]: $355 or 55,000 people from importing.

705
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:19,994
[SPEAKER_07]: No, of course not.

706
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:25,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also – obviously this is a counterplay to the tariff situation.

707
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:35,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I did talk about this on social media and somebody brought up it also could have to do with how the price of the yen is kind of doing overall and perhaps why Sony is making a strategy like this.

708
00:58:36,044 --> 00:58:41,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I find it very interesting that Nintendo and Sony are making similar moves to be quite honest.

709
00:58:41,694 --> 00:58:42,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So –

710
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

711
00:58:44,097 --> 00:58:48,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Deft says the Witch game was made by Pocket Pair of PowWorld fame.

712
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:50,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh, I didn't catch that.

713
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:52,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, the game looked good.

714
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:58,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at least Metroidvania is something that's been copied a ton of times, so PowWorld can copy that, no problem.

715
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:02,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, no one will sue them over that.

716
00:59:02,578 --> 00:59:02,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

717
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

718
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, just more shenanigans.

719
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:14,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and in fact, this is kind of something that I think a lot of people have already seen coming.

720
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Funko Pop company, you know, the one that gives us all those weird looking figures that some of us are actually oddly attracted to.

721
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:30,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Has they revealed in their last quarterly earnings report that they're in trouble?

722
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:31,603
[SPEAKER_03]: They in trouble, girl.

723
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Really big concern for the next fiscal year.

724
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:48,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Because their loans are coming due, they are well in the hole for $241 million.

725
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And

726
00:59:52,870 --> 01:00:01,079
[SPEAKER_03]: As it stands right now, though, they did amend their credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase in July to waive some of the requirements to get time.

727
01:00:03,381 --> 01:00:16,836
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're not really going to be able to pay out everyone they owe by the end of the next 12 months unless they do some pretty big changes.

728
01:00:18,284 --> 01:00:26,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Their CEO, Josh Simon, basically said during their earnings call, I'm just going to read this verbatim.

729
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:34,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce.

730
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:41,625
[SPEAKER_03]: In the short term, I'm looking to maintain the moment that they previously discussed.

731
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:48,460
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot more, you know, corporate talk happening.

732
01:00:48,862 --> 01:01:17,011
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that sort of like is kind of funny to me, not necessarily funny, haha, is that he's saying that as far as the company have existing for the last 27 years, they want to leverage that legacy they have and the relationship with the community to increase this, quote, global world of entertainment, pop culture, fandom with the increasing global world.

733
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:18,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So

734
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:23,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying, oh, we have opportunities.

735
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:24,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this.

736
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:37,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not necessarily more that it has to do with losing licenses or how oversaturated the markets become.

737
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:42,472
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is also going back to the fucking tariffs.

738
01:01:42,492 --> 01:01:45,075
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of toys are made overseas.

739
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:57,545
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that Funko has found some success in that, honestly enough, I'm kind of surprised they didn't do this a lot earlier is blind boxes.

740
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:59,407
[SPEAKER_03]: The mystery boxes.

741
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:01,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at how the Labubus are doing.

742
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,574
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Labubu vending machine at the movie theater.

743
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:08,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Those Popmarts are popping the fuck off.

744
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought my first one, Rob.

745
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,902
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a you problem.

746
01:02:13,405 --> 01:02:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not like a Lububu one.

747
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:20,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the other PopMart ones, but it's the Disney ones, and I have a Daisy Duck.

748
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:26,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan's not into Lububu specifically, but like a lot of those, like the other types of stuff they sell at PopMart and the blind boxes, he's into that stuff.

749
01:02:26,885 --> 01:02:28,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the monsters.

750
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:29,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I want one.

751
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:30,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I only want one.

752
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:35,098
[SPEAKER_07]: One day there will be a set where I go, I want that.

753
01:02:35,178 --> 01:02:36,119
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll, you know.

754
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:37,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I see the Lububu things.

755
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:38,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have the Demu Daisy.

756
01:02:38,643 --> 01:02:39,885
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one Sia Tiberi.

757
01:02:40,372 --> 01:02:42,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just where the wild things are.

758
01:02:42,515 --> 01:02:43,116
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I see.

759
01:02:43,136 --> 01:02:45,600
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making merch for where the wild things are.

760
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:52,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the demus are cuter than the monsters.

761
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:52,611
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

762
01:02:55,035 --> 01:02:55,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to this.

763
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:05,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We're either going to have a more tailored market, a lot more blind boxes, or more landfills.

764
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:07,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

765
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:14,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, I was giggling at SSJ100 Matt's comment in chat saying, I thought they were in trouble when they were burying Funkos in the desert like E.T.

766
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just thinking about like the parallels with Atari.

767
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:23,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And when Atari and the game industry crashed in the 80s, it was like, you know, those things were everywhere.

768
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:30,448
[SPEAKER_07]: The games, you know, and it's not a complete parallel because obviously there were like anybody could make an Atari game at that point.

769
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:32,811
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of shovelware and stuff like that.

770
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:34,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also feel like with

771
01:03:34,253 --> 01:03:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: with Funko Pops they're not special anymore like it used to be like a niche thing you would find in like a corner of a hot topic but now it's like they're fucking everywhere and I feel like it's just not special like it was in the beginning I think it was their point is that they wanted it to hit everywhere I don't know if that was the best strategy I do yeah and see I I only I

772
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:18,520
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

773
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:47,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do this funky but I can get it it's not a big deal if not I can put it somewhere else it's just a demonstration and the other thing too is that they really fucked up with losing the license for Dead by Daylight because I thought the Funko Pop ones would have been a lot cuter than the U2's although that has not stopped me from getting the Legion and the Meg and if they do a pig I'll get pig

774
01:04:48,993 --> 01:04:54,109
[SPEAKER_07]: and I have a Jeff the Shark I think I figured out how to do this

775
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:55,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

776
01:04:55,609 --> 01:05:07,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, for the live folks, for the folks on the podcast, you have to explain this a little bit, but we're seeing a large wall of Funko Pops pictured with a door with an ace flag hanging off of it.

777
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:09,471
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's some very large Funko Pops here.

778
01:05:10,272 --> 01:05:14,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have like a Unicron and I have a Retsuko with the chainsaw.

779
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:20,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have like just the ones that I get are like the ones I'm super interested in.

780
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:42,068
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah I have Unicron Spike and then those are like my Marvel ones up there and actually not all my Marvel ones but I have like my Hanukkah Donald Duck and you know just some different gaming ones and like I don't often want all the same ones all the time but uh

781
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:51,687
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

782
01:05:53,388 --> 01:06:21,454
[SPEAKER_07]: and I just give those away I actually have a bunch of the supernatural ones too that I am finding a new home for I only have a handful of the pop dolls I have a random Mass Effect or Overwatch one here and there and then I have some Drag Queen ones I have the Golden Girls and I have Drag Queen ones because the Golden Girls were the game specifically I have a Britney Spears and a Whitney Houston as well but I'm told my Trixie Mattel doll is apparently worth some money oh yeah yeah

783
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:29,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my supernatural ones, some of the ones I have are worth some money, like a couple of my Castiel's and my Crowley.

784
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:42,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Ranma, I'll think of something, but they're kind of worth some money, question mark, in Tarabang.

785
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:47,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to the thing, it's like...

786
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that... That's like the extent I go with mine.

787
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,978
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I know people... You're familiar with Polyester, right?

788
01:06:59,221 --> 01:07:00,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, streamer on Twitch, right?

789
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:03,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dead by Daylight, Fog Whisperer.

790
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:10,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever he's live, there are walls of illuminated cabinets of pop figures behind him.

791
01:07:12,312 --> 01:07:17,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who are worse than that, or better, maybe?

792
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's just so many collectors out there that would be really surprised by this, but the fact is that

793
01:07:32,123 --> 01:07:33,485
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting ridiculous.

794
01:07:34,066 --> 01:07:39,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to order one of the ones for the pig, the Saw ones.

795
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:45,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's either Kramer, which is the normal one, or there's a special one in six is the pig mask.

796
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:52,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you just go to directly buy the pig mask one, they're charging $70 for it or more.

797
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go just to get the John Kramer one, it's still almost $20.

798
01:07:56,175 --> 01:07:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just...

799
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:03,227
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

800
01:08:03,508 --> 01:08:13,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's such a disparity because then you go into, say, GameStop or something, and they do the BOGOs for the pop figures, or they're marked down.

801
01:08:14,521 --> 01:08:15,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I find them at Ross all the time.

802
01:08:17,604 --> 01:08:20,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I wouldn't have thought to check there, but that makes a lot of sense.

803
01:08:21,008 --> 01:08:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also where I go to look for Transformers for Dan.

804
01:08:24,052 --> 01:08:24,152
Okay.

805
01:08:24,588 --> 01:08:25,754
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

806
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:26,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on.

807
01:08:26,578 --> 01:08:28,226
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have some ground to cover.

808
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's get to this, Loki.

809
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:31,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I find this interesting.

810
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:39,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like, I don't even know if I was looking forward to a Fallout 4 10th Anniversary Edition.

811
01:08:39,943 --> 01:08:45,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is funny, because I think they just did a Fallout 4 Remaster not that long ago, or some sort of extra edition.

812
01:08:46,214 --> 01:08:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that just came out, because I remember going to play Fallout 4 again, but I was like, oh, this breaks all the modding stuff.

813
01:08:53,787 --> 01:08:55,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now they have...

814
01:08:55,250 --> 01:09:08,685
[SPEAKER_06]: yet another Fallout 4 version the Anniversary Edition and it came out and it's supposed to have fixed a few issues but in usual Bethesda fashion they fucked it all up because

815
01:09:09,965 --> 01:09:11,127
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what they do.

816
01:09:12,308 --> 01:09:14,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently they had some issues.

817
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:28,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, mainly I think the main reason, the whole point of them putting this out is so they can shove that fucking creation part into Fallout 4 so they can sell their own mods and DLC.

818
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:30,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's in there.

819
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:32,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also breaking save games.

820
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:36,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also asking you to install the extra DLC.

821
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:36,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

822
01:09:37,353 --> 01:10:01,335
[SPEAKER_06]: while you already have the DLC installed is doing a lot of things they also complicated the whole launch of this by basically saying here's a chart here's a chart for all the game versions that you can buy and you know you need the chart so that you know what you're getting and that's annoying um

823
01:10:02,058 --> 01:10:05,201
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the very least, they're going to be patching it.

824
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:12,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the patches to fix a lot of these issues aren't going to be coming out between... Some of them aren't coming out until December.

825
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:30,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, they are hot-fixing the stability problems with Xbox One and PlayStation 4, fixing an issue causing creations that rely on DLC not to work, and fixing an issue causing DLCs to become uninstalled after updating the game on PlayStation.

826
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:33,476
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah, that sucks.

827
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:35,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you keep breaking things?

828
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:47,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe design a new engine or use a current engine that people have instead of shoehorting this thing that's been around for longer than 10 years.

829
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:50,440
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot longer than 10 years with this horse stuff.

830
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:53,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not a great look on this one.

831
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:56,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It just makes it seem kind of rushed, right?

832
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean...

833
01:11:00,412 --> 01:11:00,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

834
01:11:01,253 --> 01:11:02,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really needed?

835
01:11:02,815 --> 01:11:10,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, if it's just putting the creation stuff in there and doing some hotfixes, like, just patch the game if you want to do hotfixes.

836
01:11:10,245 --> 01:11:13,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, all they're trying to do is make some extra money.

837
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:19,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you may remember, Bethesda is owned by Microsoft, and Microsoft need be profitable.

838
01:11:19,437 --> 01:11:20,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, 30%.

839
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:24,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta shove that 30% into Fallout 4.

840
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:26,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta make them monies.

841
01:11:26,987 --> 01:11:27,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

842
01:11:28,964 --> 01:11:31,770
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

843
01:11:32,231 --> 01:11:33,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

844
01:11:33,173 --> 01:11:35,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot that's because Bethesda is part of Microsoft now.

845
01:11:35,819 --> 01:11:38,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's all part of that fuckery too, right?

846
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:40,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So good lord.

847
01:11:40,448 --> 01:11:40,729
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

848
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in the realm of questionable decisions.

849
01:11:44,557 --> 01:11:49,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about what's going on with Black Ops 7.

850
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:54,966
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, because this is the game that they upped the price of Game Pass because they wanted to put this game on Game Pass.

851
01:11:54,986 --> 01:11:56,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, guess what folks are noticing?

852
01:11:57,569 --> 01:11:58,970
[SPEAKER_07]: AI-generated art.

853
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, while nothing is confirmed, it is, of course, getting called out on social media, as these things tend to do, that, hey, look, here's this photo where this cartoon character has six fingers.

854
01:12:10,901 --> 01:12:12,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And the eyes don't look quite right.

855
01:12:12,502 --> 01:12:18,329
[SPEAKER_06]: They also look like all of the Studio Ghibli stuff.

856
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how they have the AI-generated art stuff.

857
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:28,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so weird though because it's Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and it's like some anime-styled knights.

858
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:33,647
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that have to do with anything that's going on in Black Ops?

859
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:37,632
[SPEAKER_06]: It has literally nothing that has to do with Black Ops whatsoever.

860
01:12:37,712 --> 01:12:39,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It just looks like cheap, generic stuff.

861
01:12:39,654 --> 01:12:40,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And

862
01:12:40,936 --> 01:13:04,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they denied that it was happening.

863
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players.

864
01:13:09,648 --> 01:13:13,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.

865
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,630
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a long way of saying, you got me.

866
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,868
[SPEAKER_07]: They got us, Cal.

867
01:13:19,888 --> 01:13:32,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, there's a difference between using tools like, say, for example, like AI tools that cut the spaces, the blank dead air spaces on a podcast or something like that to edit down the podcast.

868
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:33,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tool.

869
01:13:33,603 --> 01:13:42,714
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're using this tool to do all of your work for you and you're just like, well, my job is to go, yeah, that looks good enough and then send it on its way.

870
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm sorry, that doesn't really...

871
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:52,388
[SPEAKER_06]: it's clear when the art style there is no cohesive art style

872
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:57,387
[SPEAKER_07]: AI should be a tool to help folks in creating art.

873
01:13:57,848 --> 01:13:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: AI should not be a replacement for art.

874
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:05,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very obvious here that the art assets are being replaced with AI-generated stuff.

875
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:05,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

876
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:08,741
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, it's not just EA.

877
01:14:08,801 --> 01:14:10,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise, surprise.

878
01:14:10,624 --> 01:14:15,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Anno 117 Pax Romana is a game that Ubisoft's been pushing.

879
01:14:15,329 --> 01:14:17,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do I need to read the rest of the story?

880
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,113
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know where this is going.

881
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:19,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You all know where this is going.

882
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You already know.

883
01:14:22,557 --> 01:14:48,193
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

884
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:50,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, why?

885
01:14:50,276 --> 01:14:52,779
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so proud of the work that you put out.

886
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying it's cheap shit and you shouldn't be using AI?

887
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:58,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were so proud of the AI that you're using.

888
01:14:58,185 --> 01:15:07,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they put a banner on the store that they're using AI and this image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process.

889
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:09,919
[SPEAKER_07]: The final image is attached here.

890
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:13,283
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking bullshit.

891
01:15:13,303 --> 01:15:14,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

892
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:18,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just Ubisoft doesn't give us a lot of reasons to believe them, so why should we?

893
01:15:21,097 --> 01:15:21,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

894
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:22,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should.

895
01:15:22,704 --> 01:15:23,487
[SPEAKER_05]: No one should believe them.

896
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:25,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

897
01:15:25,576 --> 01:15:26,038
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

898
01:15:27,826 --> 01:15:29,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so...

899
01:15:30,445 --> 01:15:37,257
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an anime coming out for Death Stranding Isolations is what it's called.

900
01:15:37,277 --> 01:15:41,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a working title so far and it will stream on Disney Plus in 2027.

901
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:51,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's very early announcement for that, but it's basically just

902
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:56,671
[SPEAKER_03]: People on Adventures in the World of Death Stranding, as far as I can tell.

903
01:15:56,691 --> 01:15:58,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It is produced by Kojima.

904
01:15:58,393 --> 01:16:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Director is Sano Takayuki.

905
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:07,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Character design by Ilya Kuvshinov.

906
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:11,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's being produced by E&H Productions.

907
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's set in North America.

908
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:19,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically people just dealing with their isolation.

909
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:22,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

910
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:25,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad I'm not going to see it because it's Disney Plus and I fucking cancelled that service.

911
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:27,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what else is coming out?

912
01:16:27,879 --> 01:16:30,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least according to Bob Iger, what he wants to do with Disney?

913
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:34,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how all these companies are ripping off all this stuff with AI?

914
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, fuck that shit.

915
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we making money off of that?

916
01:16:39,415 --> 01:16:48,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So he wants to incorporate that shit with your own IP and so you can generate your own cartoons and shit using Disney IP on their platform.

917
01:16:48,508 --> 01:16:49,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that shit.

918
01:16:50,028 --> 01:16:57,275
[SPEAKER_03]: If they wouldn't run that risk with their intellectual material, then sure, I guess.

919
01:16:57,796 --> 01:16:59,377
[SPEAKER_07]: What a horrible decision.

920
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:01,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So how long until the Mickey Mouse porn?

921
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: How long until the Mickey Mouse porn that's AI generated?

922
01:17:05,423 --> 01:17:08,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm sure you all are saying, well, there's plenty of that on the internet, Rob.

923
01:17:08,827 --> 01:17:14,953
[SPEAKER_07]: How often until I can generate it and share it so easily on Disney Plus?

924
01:17:14,973 --> 01:17:15,794
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just silly.

925
01:17:17,295 --> 01:17:17,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

926
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:20,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

927
01:17:21,956 --> 01:17:23,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, I think you got our next story.

928
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:24,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

929
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Red Dead Redemption is back again.

930
01:17:29,764 --> 01:17:32,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they're going to be doing some updates to the game.

931
01:17:33,768 --> 01:17:36,912
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bringing it out on a few different platforms as well.

932
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:44,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's now coming to the more modern platforms, Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5.

933
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,203
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting a 60 FPS update.

934
01:17:47,183 --> 01:17:54,532
[SPEAKER_06]: which is good because the game only ran at 30, enhanced image quality, HDR, and resolutions up to 4K.

935
01:17:54,552 --> 01:18:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: The Switch 2 version, not going to feature all of the 4K nonsense, but it says DLSS HDR mouse controls, also 60 FPS, okay?

936
01:18:05,005 --> 01:18:06,908
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a high resolution, not 4K.

937
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, and so that's going to be coming out also on Netflix.

938
01:18:13,576 --> 01:18:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Netflix on iOS and Android.

939
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:18,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's mobile too, so you can play it through Netflix.

940
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

941
01:18:22,054 --> 01:18:22,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everywhere.

942
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:26,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Netflix has been pushing the game thing lately.

943
01:18:26,603 --> 01:18:28,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a lot more ads for it.

944
01:18:28,307 --> 01:18:29,830
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really trying to

945
01:18:29,995 --> 01:18:51,362
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

946
01:18:51,342 --> 01:19:04,761
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the 60, they really could use some more games with 60 FPS updates and stuff, like I could think like I would love a remaster of Grand Theft Auto 4 please, can I get that please like that would be amazing

947
01:19:06,513 --> 01:19:14,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, before we get to the classic game of the week, it's interesting how fast this particular game is becoming a classic games of sorts.

948
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Conquered, you remember that?

949
01:19:16,473 --> 01:19:22,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't blame you if you didn't because it was out for a week and then they pulled it and ended up refunding everybody.

950
01:19:22,204 --> 01:19:23,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The game bombed that hard.

951
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:30,756
[SPEAKER_07]: and, uh, you know, it did lead to discussion among people about, you know, well, why the fuck do we buy these games and then companies can just pull them?

952
01:19:30,776 --> 01:19:31,557
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

953
01:19:31,577 --> 01:19:32,918
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep this game alive.

954
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:34,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, this is wild.

955
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:44,012
[SPEAKER_07]: The internet, the modding community added again, the modding community rebuilt Concord's backend, created new servers, uh,

956
01:19:43,992 --> 01:19:44,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

957
01:19:45,134 --> 01:19:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

958
01:19:59,382 --> 01:20:15,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think Sony is really happy about this particular thing, but this is just leading to that kind of climax here of the players battling back against these game companies who pull the plug on things that fans are trying to support.

959
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:18,875
[SPEAKER_07]: and saying, you know what, that thing you spent your money on, never mind.

960
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:22,221
[SPEAKER_07]: At least Sony refunded players in this circumstance.

961
01:20:22,241 --> 01:20:25,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like the crew sort of circumstance where it was up for a year and then it was pulled.

962
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:31,336
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not surprised and nobody should be that this kind of happened.

963
01:20:31,356 --> 01:20:38,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just also lends itself to that whole, the servers are hard to keep up and expensive and da-da-da-da.

964
01:20:38,988 --> 01:20:41,573
[SPEAKER_07]: The modders just showed you a way to do it.

965
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if they have a server or if they did a player-to-player thing or what they did, but however they did it, they got them running without Sony's involvement, which is a huge sort of kick in the butt in a way.

966
01:20:54,898 --> 01:20:56,681
[SPEAKER_06]: More effort than should have been put into that game.

967
01:20:56,701 --> 01:20:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it better than us.

968
01:20:57,883 --> 01:20:58,384
[SPEAKER_03]: We're mad.

969
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:00,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of.

970
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:06,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, QuestBuster does say, Sony DMCA'd the gameplay videos on YouTube, but not the project.

971
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:08,294
[SPEAKER_07]: At least not yet.

972
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:10,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's because that's going to be the lawsuit, QuestBuster.

973
01:21:10,941 --> 01:21:11,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wait.

974
01:21:11,543 --> 01:21:12,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait till Monday.

975
01:21:12,907 --> 01:21:13,709
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens.

976
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:15,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But I...

977
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:18,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to see something like this go to court.

978
01:21:18,678 --> 01:21:19,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It never will.

979
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:23,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if a lawsuit is filed, these things never go to court.

980
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:32,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we are always in this problem because they are always settled before a judge or at some point the Supreme Court makes a determination.

981
01:21:32,592 --> 01:21:35,715
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always settled.

982
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:36,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

983
01:21:36,757 --> 01:21:39,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know the reason why a lot of companies insist on settling, right?

984
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,180
Yeah.

985
01:21:40,885 --> 01:21:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to make it avoid setting any sort of precedence by going that far.

986
01:21:46,293 --> 01:21:46,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

987
01:21:46,894 --> 01:21:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's true.

988
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:52,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, sorry for the noise sneaking in there.

989
01:21:52,121 --> 01:21:52,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm setting up something else.

990
01:21:54,445 --> 01:22:02,416
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what if it were to be that the precedent is set that no, gamers have the right to do this?

991
01:22:03,698 --> 01:22:08,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think it's a huge win for a lot of people, but I think the gaming industry might see that as a bit of a loss.

992
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:17,980
[SPEAKER_07]: so anyway alright let's take a trip down memory lane with our next segment

993
01:22:28,338 --> 01:22:36,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

994
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:39,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

995
01:22:39,972 --> 01:22:51,105
[SPEAKER_07]: And something I think that folks need to keep in mind with this is that you've only got two of these picks left, so you got to make them count, right?

996
01:22:51,608 --> 01:22:52,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

997
01:22:52,389 --> 01:22:55,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's kind of where we're going tonight.

998
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:57,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame Rob for this one, though.

999
01:22:57,254 --> 01:22:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: In a way, you got to sign off on it.

1000
01:22:59,477 --> 01:23:01,179
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the classic?

1001
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have even had it on my radar.

1002
01:23:03,321 --> 01:23:04,683
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1003
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:06,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to do Legendary Wings, okay?

1004
01:23:07,746 --> 01:23:10,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think this one's a long time coming.

1005
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:11,871
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the classic game of the week?

1006
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:14,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the groove.

1007
01:23:14,913 --> 01:23:21,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a rhythm game developed and published by Rocksaur Games.

1008
01:23:21,123 --> 01:23:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It was first shown in a beta test preview on July 9th, 2024 and officially released August 30th, 2024 in arcades.

1009
01:23:30,197 --> 01:23:40,313
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been some ports and sequels and stuff, but basically it...

1010
01:23:40,698 --> 01:23:42,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone thought this too.

1011
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It was completely biting off of DDR.

1012
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:54,719
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with your scrolling arrows and you hit the arrows on the top and you have holds and all this stuff and like things that have come out.

1013
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically all stuff that came out from DDR.

1014
01:23:57,022 --> 01:24:03,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the games are, the game, it is a ripoff.

1015
01:24:03,732 --> 01:24:04,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to say it right now.

1016
01:24:04,693 --> 01:24:05,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a ripoff.

1017
01:24:06,533 --> 01:24:09,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you've got your life bar and everything.

1018
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:12,140
[SPEAKER_03]: If you play DDR, you've played this.

1019
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:18,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you also, you know, you have different modifiers for speed and all of that.

1020
01:24:18,688 --> 01:24:20,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I agree with Rinmari.

1021
01:24:21,792 --> 01:24:24,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good ripoff.

1022
01:24:24,836 --> 01:24:33,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, Seer in chat, formerly a Konami employee, saying that being in office when the PS2 release came out was wild.

1023
01:24:34,888 --> 01:24:34,988
Yeah.

1024
01:24:35,812 --> 01:25:01,397
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah there's like the different game modes you have like your normal dance mode you have a marathon mode where you have extended play battle mode is your versus play and when this first came out there were 76 songs that were available some were exclusive for PC and Mac and

1025
01:25:02,255 --> 01:25:04,238
[SPEAKER_03]: A name we all know quite well.

1026
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:12,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle Ward was their in-house musician and composed many of the songs.

1027
01:25:12,329 --> 01:25:16,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving a little bit on.

1028
01:25:17,036 --> 01:25:19,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there were home versions.

1029
01:25:19,099 --> 01:25:25,268
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a PS2 release on June 17th, 2025, published by Red Octane.

1030
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:30,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a novice mode that went into In The Groove 2.

1031
01:25:30,335 --> 01:25:35,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Liquid Moon was a playable track and four songs that were going to show up in the sequel.

1032
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:50,373
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a PC version that had three songs from the cancelled In The Groove 3, widescreen aspect and edit mode, a patch called Song Pack A that released the additional songs and themes from In The Groove 2.

1033
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:59,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can progress through the game by clearing certain songs and modifiers and courses and different things to make it through the game.

1034
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:21,891
[SPEAKER_03]: um yeah and Rinmari points out Stepmania X is uh basically in the group three um so here was and this is where I said it's a rip-off Konami basically filed a lawsuit against Rockstar Games on infringement um this was on May 9th 2025 in Texas um

1035
01:26:23,272 --> 01:26:31,082
[SPEAKER_03]: and they amended their complaint on July 1st, 2025 to include MC Groove's dance craze by Mad Catz.

1036
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:35,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically were, huh?

1037
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, oh God, I barely remember that.

1038
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:38,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, yeah, yeah.

1039
01:26:38,372 --> 01:26:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

1040
01:26:39,714 --> 01:26:50,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically saying that Roxor infringed on their patent rights and that they were retrofitting arcade cabinets in an infringing and unfair way.

1041
01:26:50,188 --> 01:26:51,169
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the quote.

1042
01:26:51,149 --> 01:26:58,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they amended their complaint to include the In The Groove PS2 game and Red Octane.

1043
01:26:59,665 --> 01:27:14,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So on July 25th, Roxor, that's in 2025, filed a counterclaim against Konami where they denied the claims of the complaint, saying that In The Groove does not violate patent law and claiming that Konami had engaged in unfair competition.

1044
01:27:14,032 --> 01:27:15,974
[SPEAKER_03]: They eventually settled.

1045
01:27:15,994 --> 01:27:25,226
[SPEAKER_03]: On October 18th, Rockstar announced that Konami had acquired the intellectual property rights to In the Groove series as part of the settlement up to litigation.

1046
01:27:25,246 --> 01:27:35,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would later go on to create Pump It Up Pro, which is a spinoff of Pump It Up that features music and some of the features of In the Groove.

1047
01:27:36,821 --> 01:27:40,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we also know Pump It Up is the five-button arrow smasher.

1048
01:27:42,348 --> 01:27:47,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was built in a PC system called Boxor.

1049
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:53,267
[SPEAKER_03]: that ran a heavily modified version of DB and Linux.

1050
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:58,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a standard IDE hard disk, single core 32-bit processor.

1051
01:28:00,054 --> 01:28:06,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They favored the AMD Athlon or the Intel Celeron, 128-megabyte NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 graphics card.

1052
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:08,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now thinking of that.

1053
01:28:08,744 --> 01:28:09,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting edge.

1054
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:10,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1055
01:28:11,226 --> 01:28:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And 512 megabytes of DDR RAM.

1056
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:16,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1057
01:28:16,452 --> 01:28:19,936
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so ripping off DDR that it's DDR RAM.

1058
01:28:22,098 --> 01:28:32,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the upgrade kits were for Dance Dance Revolution machines and they had a special IO board called ItGeo that made a JAMA connection to the machine.

1059
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:41,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were using a proprietary fork of Stepmania to run the game.

1060
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:45,947
[SPEAKER_03]: They did install their own anti-piracy measures, which I also think is hilarious.

1061
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:52,816
[SPEAKER_03]: They used a serial dongle that prevented the execution of software on an unlicensed computer.

1062
01:28:53,737 --> 01:29:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And for In The Groove 2, the ones that were manufactured by Andomero, they have BIOS passwords.

1063
01:29:01,989 --> 01:29:08,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So going from this, this is the... I mean, that's really how it went.

1064
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:09,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And In The Groove...

1065
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:16,838
[SPEAKER_02]: It is... At Ranma, I did say that their system was called Boxor.

1066
01:29:18,821 --> 01:29:25,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... It's, um... It's complicated.

1067
01:29:25,691 --> 01:29:29,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I, to this day, have not played an In the Groove.

1068
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: To this day.

1069
01:29:34,603 --> 01:29:36,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not played on a Stepmania.

1070
01:29:37,607 --> 01:29:38,248
[SPEAKER_02]: To this day.

1071
01:29:40,186 --> 01:29:49,676
[SPEAKER_03]: because, honestly, I did see this as a big stupid ripoff and I was very much supporting Konami.

1072
01:29:49,877 --> 01:30:04,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to, you know, and I think I was a little bit more naive then when I was like, well, supporting the company that makes the games that I love might encourage them that, yeah, there is still a market for it.

1073
01:30:05,654 --> 01:30:05,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1074
01:30:06,578 --> 01:30:18,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to think that maybe it was this whole thing that spawned new continuations and expansions upon DDR to where, honestly, it's the survivor today.

1075
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:20,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still going.

1076
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,082
[SPEAKER_03]: There's new versions going on.

1077
01:30:22,182 --> 01:30:24,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really like the dance stage.

1078
01:30:24,584 --> 01:30:39,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Just real quick, I just want to emphasize something you're saying there, Jamie, because I feel like, you know, in the past, when you look at this show, we all were pretty hard on this game when it came out, because I think we were, you know, hoping that, I don't know if it was that like Konami would, you know, see the light or whatever and so forth.

1079
01:30:39,762 --> 01:30:47,571
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really feel like the interview that we did with Kyle Ward, and I don't remember what episode number it was, but it's back in one of the most insightful episodes we've ever done.

1080
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:59,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think for me, it made it very clear that you kind of started to say that there is that this was sort of one way of showing that Konami's products, they wanted more.

1081
01:30:59,354 --> 01:31:01,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really like the dance game scene.

1082
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:01,959
[SPEAKER_07]: They want more of that.

1083
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:04,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And Konami wasn't giving it to us.

1084
01:31:04,865 --> 01:31:25,185
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1085
01:31:25,165 --> 01:31:39,563
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah it's interesting and kind of just quickly as you say there at the end I think without this maybe Konami doesn't see where we want more of this in the US so it's interesting to have that sort of like

1086
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: How it all ended up playing out in the end.

1087
01:31:43,835 --> 01:31:45,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just interesting.

1088
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:46,521
[SPEAKER_07]: As John Hunter-Matt says, episode 596.

1089
01:31:47,143 --> 01:31:47,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1090
01:31:47,524 --> 01:31:50,791
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's in the OL archive that Dark Tetsuya has.

1091
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:54,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, everything 500 on is still on the server.

1092
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:59,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could find 596 still on the server at least for another month or two.

1093
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:00,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway.

1094
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:03,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, DarkSakura, but I just wanted to underline what you said there because I think it's important.

1095
01:32:03,397 --> 01:32:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also important to say, I think, that our thoughts behind it have changed a lot from where they were a thousand episodes ago.

1096
01:32:12,247 --> 01:32:13,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't think I'm going to play it.

1097
01:32:13,909 --> 01:32:15,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made it this long, now it's bite.

1098
01:32:15,331 --> 01:32:17,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't think you can at this point.

1099
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:19,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be very difficult.

1100
01:32:19,256 --> 01:32:20,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen machines here and there.

1101
01:32:21,979 --> 01:32:26,664
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I also, it's just like, what's the point?

1102
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:28,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1103
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:30,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played it.

1104
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1105
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:34,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's DDR, but theftier.

1106
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:39,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I think the Rob in 2025 views that game through a different lens than the Rob of 2005.

1107
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:45,674
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's one of those things where I go, it is what it is and I understand how we got here.

1108
01:32:45,934 --> 01:32:49,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I too am frustrated that Konami was not putting out

1109
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,162
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of dance games at the time.

1110
01:32:51,462 --> 01:32:54,728
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was that home version was their biggest mistake.

1111
01:32:54,788 --> 01:32:55,750
[SPEAKER_07]: They never should have done that.

1112
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:58,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the one part where Konami was leaning into.

1113
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:01,540
[SPEAKER_07]: They were still making Xbox versions and PS2 versions.

1114
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,984
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they made their mistake.

1115
01:33:04,004 --> 01:33:04,765
[SPEAKER_07]: But they know that now.

1116
01:33:05,487 --> 01:33:09,133
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard about the patents of the arrows and the way that works and stuff.

1117
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:12,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And that not everything is...

1118
01:33:12,018 --> 01:33:40,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget your past.

1119
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everyone, did you know that OLR was born on a train?

1120
01:33:54,897 --> 01:33:56,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, on the BART.

1121
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:56,780
[SPEAKER_03]: BART!

1122
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, on the BART.

1123
01:33:58,743 --> 01:34:02,990
[SPEAKER_07]: With my ex, where I have no idea where he is, by the way.

1124
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:06,135
[SPEAKER_07]: If he's still out there, so if he came around, like, you can say hi.

1125
01:34:06,335 --> 01:34:08,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm like, is he alive?

1126
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:14,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly don't know, which is a weird thing to think, but I've tried looking Facebook and all that stuff.

1127
01:34:14,809 --> 01:34:15,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange, right?

1128
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:19,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the Parapar craze has basically died.

1129
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:39,670
[SPEAKER_03]: there hasn't been a Parapara club to my knowledge like I think Velfar closed in about seven years ago or more maybe closed a long time ago yeah yeah um but but I mean Eurobeat's still going but the Parapara craze is is gone all right they got therapy it's no longer a craze

1130
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1131
01:34:57,757 --> 01:34:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what it is.

1132
01:34:59,038 --> 01:34:59,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

1133
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:00,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

1134
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:01,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I think y'all will be pleased.

1135
01:35:01,801 --> 01:35:03,342
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

1136
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:04,463
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1137
01:35:05,144 --> 01:35:09,008
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, it's one of those games where I'm like, we didn't already talk.

1138
01:35:09,588 --> 01:35:09,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1139
01:35:10,809 --> 01:35:11,110
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1140
01:35:12,030 --> 01:35:13,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, let the theory begin.

1141
01:35:13,772 --> 01:35:15,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe I was saving it.

1142
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:16,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe.

1143
01:35:16,595 --> 01:35:16,835
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1144
01:35:16,855 --> 01:35:19,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's do some rapid fire news.

1145
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:20,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit some other headlines real quick here.

1146
01:35:20,759 --> 01:35:21,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have a lot of news to get into.

1147
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:22,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1148
01:35:25,183 --> 01:35:26,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki is muted.

1149
01:35:26,782 --> 01:35:27,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we do.

1150
01:35:27,503 --> 01:35:29,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We are muted.

1151
01:35:30,185 --> 01:35:33,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some more LEGO stuff coming, and I'm excited about it.

1152
01:35:33,949 --> 01:35:37,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've already gotten one set in the Legend of Zelda series.

1153
01:35:37,372 --> 01:35:49,104
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the whole Dooku tree, and now we're going to be getting more as a tease that was put out by Nintendo of America announcing that Build the Legend coming in 2026.

1154
01:35:49,384 --> 01:35:53,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like we're getting another Link version

1155
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:57,376
[SPEAKER_06]: and Zelda minifigs as well as a Ganon build.

1156
01:35:58,538 --> 01:35:59,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So that looks pretty cool.

1157
01:36:01,624 --> 01:36:03,107
[SPEAKER_06]: No word on what those sets are going to be.

1158
01:36:03,367 --> 01:36:06,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that we'll find out as we get closer to that time.

1159
01:36:08,177 --> 01:36:08,538
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1160
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:10,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, Legos.

1161
01:36:10,902 --> 01:36:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: More toys for adults.

1162
01:36:12,565 --> 01:36:12,886
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1163
01:36:13,908 --> 01:36:14,389
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1164
01:36:16,259 --> 01:36:22,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually a game I was considering playing for one of my retro games.

1165
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:24,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Doshin the Giant.

1166
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:29,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out for 64DD and GameCube.

1167
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:33,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's going to be heading for the...

1168
01:36:33,826 --> 01:36:38,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, this isn't the one that's heading toward the sish.

1169
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:40,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just games from the creator.

1170
01:36:40,074 --> 01:36:41,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that sucks.

1171
01:36:41,936 --> 01:36:46,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Tale of the Sun and Aquanauts Holiday both came out on PS1.

1172
01:36:47,523 --> 01:36:52,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are reviewing the titles for a preservation project.

1173
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:57,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are, looks like they're going to be coming out.

1174
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:00,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

1175
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:02,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I misread this.

1176
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:33,398
[SPEAKER_03]: they're reviving them for this preservation project I saw Doshin the Giant and that's all I was focusing on I love Doshin the Giant but it's other misleading article is misleading same brain though but anyway there's no release confirmed for western audiences but it could happen alright and no Brad it's not Naughty Bear

1177
01:37:34,323 --> 01:37:39,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell them all the no's or they'll figure out the yes I think I've already done Naughty Bear, haven't I?

1178
01:37:40,413 --> 01:37:41,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you have

1179
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:42,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Lord.

1180
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:42,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1181
01:37:43,081 --> 01:37:43,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1182
01:37:43,382 --> 01:37:43,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1183
01:37:43,742 --> 01:37:44,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Check the Wii.

1184
01:37:44,183 --> 01:37:44,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone check the Wii.

1185
01:37:45,044 --> 01:37:45,644
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1186
01:37:46,145 --> 01:37:55,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, this is a real small thing, but if you care, Nintendo launched a new website so you can see what Switch games are working without issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.

1187
01:37:56,957 --> 01:38:03,245
[SPEAKER_07]: But some games like Nier Automata, the end of Yora Edition, don't quite function properly on Switch 2.

1188
01:38:03,285 --> 01:38:06,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are some games, if you want to check that out,

1189
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:08,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe the name of this website.

1190
01:38:08,311 --> 01:38:09,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

1191
01:38:09,112 --> 01:38:23,213
[SPEAKER_07]: switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com I think Nintendo needs one of those URL shortener sites, but switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com

1192
01:38:23,193 --> 01:38:25,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want the English version, slash en-us.

1193
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't I put that link in chat?

1194
01:38:28,604 --> 01:38:32,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're on the podcast, you're just going to have to rewind and write that down.

1195
01:38:32,051 --> 01:38:33,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, you can also probably just Google it.

1196
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:42,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Switch software website, which I'm curious, do the Just Dance games work pretty well?

1197
01:38:42,211 --> 01:38:43,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, let's see.

1198
01:38:43,633 --> 01:38:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Dance 2019.

1199
01:38:45,256 --> 01:38:45,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Supported.

1200
01:38:46,377 --> 01:38:48,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Just Dance free experience.

1201
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:51,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Supported and game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.

1202
01:38:51,365 --> 01:38:53,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what about Baila Latino?

1203
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:54,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know they did a spinoff game.

1204
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:55,851
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cute.

1205
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:57,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Support.

1206
01:38:57,614 --> 01:38:59,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's a different company.

1207
01:38:59,076 --> 01:39:00,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Ubisoft.

1208
01:39:00,037 --> 01:39:04,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, someone like ripped off Just Dance to make a Latin American version of that.

1209
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's kind of, that's actually kind of smart.

1210
01:39:07,789 --> 01:39:08,590
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

1211
01:39:10,055 --> 01:39:11,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm with Deft.

1212
01:39:11,137 --> 01:39:16,006
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be neat if the site would say if the game has any sort of upgrade and not just compatibility.

1213
01:39:16,026 --> 01:39:20,675
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a little more they could do with that database info, but it is what it is for now.

1214
01:39:21,056 --> 01:39:21,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's official.

1215
01:39:22,098 --> 01:39:23,961
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is that.

1216
01:39:23,981 --> 01:39:24,823

[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

1310
01:46:02,339 --> 01:46:03,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a beat-em-up.

1311
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:07,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know how they were doing, like, those, like, 8-bit beat-em-ups?

1312
01:46:07,644 --> 01:46:09,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is more like a 16-bit beat-em-up.

1313
01:46:09,646 --> 01:46:10,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know what?

1314
01:46:10,267 --> 01:46:11,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did see something for that.

1315
01:46:12,169 --> 01:46:12,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1316
01:46:12,509 --> 01:46:13,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're doing that.

1317
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:13,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes a lot more sense now.

1318
01:46:13,771 --> 01:46:14,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Splatterhouse.

1319
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1320
01:46:15,993 --> 01:46:16,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

1321
01:46:16,293 --> 01:46:20,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me a little bit more of a gory version of the Scott Pilgrim game.

1322
01:46:20,553 --> 01:46:22,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1323
01:46:22,095 --> 01:46:22,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha, 5th Dream.

1324
01:46:23,556 --> 01:46:23,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1325
01:46:25,058 --> 01:46:34,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have one more story, and it's a follow-up, and this is one of those things where I'll be very curious to see how this plays out, but I think we knew this was coming.

1326
01:46:34,848 --> 01:46:36,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, tell us the punchline.

1327
01:46:37,031 --> 01:46:47,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently, after the 31 developers were fired from Rockstar Games, a union representing the former employees has decided to file a lawsuit.

1328
01:46:48,763 --> 01:46:49,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So

1329
01:46:49,544 --> 01:46:58,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they are moving forward with legal claims against the company asserting that the firings constitute trade union victimization and blacklisting.

1330
01:46:59,619 --> 01:47:11,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a matter that is unacceptable and unlawful.

1331
01:47:12,038 --> 01:47:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the claimants.

1332
01:47:19,193 --> 01:47:21,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see how this all pans out.

1333
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:27,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Rockstar is confident that they're in the right, but of course they're always going to assert that.

1334
01:47:28,289 --> 01:47:28,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll see.

1335
01:47:29,311 --> 01:47:33,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it's a bold claim to say that they were leaking information.

1336
01:47:33,277 --> 01:47:35,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have to have evidence of that, I would imagine.

1337
01:47:35,441 --> 01:47:43,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, nor to say that the firings based off gross negligence are accurate.

1338
01:47:43,474 --> 01:47:47,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Also because we haven't really even seen any of these recent leaks or whatever.

1339
01:47:48,483 --> 01:47:48,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1340
01:47:48,803 --> 01:47:50,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be curious to see what's going on with that.

1341
01:47:51,239 --> 01:47:57,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you say lawsuit and I hear, that's what you get when you let your heart... Forget it.

1342
01:47:57,809 --> 01:47:58,089
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1343
01:48:01,073 --> 01:48:02,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we knew it was coming.

1344
01:48:02,295 --> 01:48:03,056
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew it was coming.

1345
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:06,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll be interesting to see how that all plays out.

1346
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:10,146
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll get settled, of course, because again, nothing ever actually ends up in a court.

1347
01:48:10,227 --> 01:48:12,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see what happens with that.

1348
01:48:13,932 --> 01:48:15,514
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get to the listener roundtable.

1349
01:48:15,574 --> 01:48:18,158
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, though, I think you told me you had something you want to bring up.

1350
01:48:18,847 --> 01:48:19,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, actually.

1351
01:48:19,769 --> 01:48:23,075
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, I guess a little last minute thing.

1352
01:48:23,837 --> 01:48:23,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1353
01:48:24,478 --> 01:48:28,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But, wait, what?

1354
01:48:29,388 --> 01:48:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the date on this wrong?

1355
01:48:31,873 --> 01:48:32,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

1356
01:48:33,476 --> 01:48:39,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, the date that they put on it is a future date, but they don't say the year?

1357
01:48:40,328 --> 01:48:54,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate when they do stuff like that and get their dates wrong.

1358
01:48:54,749 --> 01:49:00,497
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Festival Ultimate Appreciation Festival.

1359

[SPEAKER_03]: It will have a Danganronpa 2x2 playable demo, an exhibition era.

1363
01:49:23,994 --> 01:49:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And Seager better go to this and take me lots of pictures.

1364
01:49:26,397 --> 01:49:28,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, is Seager still going to be in Japan?

1365
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's right up his alley.

1366
01:49:30,283 --> 01:49:30,383
Yeah.

1367
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:52,354

[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to talk about something that Rob was talking about in the previous episode about it being hard to give up on something or let go.

1389
01:51:08,491 --> 01:51:12,578
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably already knows that, and he's also not alone in that aspect.

1390
01:51:12,558 --> 01:51:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally had my own struggles and I do with my own projects like my podcast GFM Cast.

1391
01:51:17,186 --> 01:51:25,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It started in 2016 and ended quite abruptly in 2023, but it ended more because of real life situations at that time that affected all the hosts.

1392
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:32,372
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, it was my decision to end it despite my host kind of wanting to continue with it, but they still agreed with GFM Cast ending.

1393
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:40,364
[SPEAKER_03]: We could probably turn to record the podcast again, but also not getting views or new listeners each week is something that unmotivated me personally.

1394
01:51:40,384 --> 01:51:44,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I don't regret making GFMcast and I don't regret my decision to end it.

1395
01:51:45,151 --> 01:51:46,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single episode was great.

1396
01:51:46,393 --> 01:51:50,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed the time with my friends and chatting about whatever we had in mind that week.

1397
01:51:50,098 --> 01:51:53,804
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also glad I finally have a full weekend to do whatever I want.

1398
01:51:53,904 --> 01:51:57,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't miss any Pokemon Go events or having to cancel an episode because of it.

1399
01:51:57,650 --> 01:52:00,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some shackles on me and now I'm free.

1400
01:51:59,993 --> 01:52:03,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the announcement came in, I was obviously surprised, but at the same time, I wasn't sad.

1401
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:05,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually kind of glad, not for us, the listeners.

1402
01:52:05,664 --> 01:52:10,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll still miss listening to OLR each week, whether live or through podcasts, but for you guys and Gal.

1403
01:52:10,714 --> 01:52:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki can focus more on his Minecraft videos and streams.

1404
01:52:13,559 --> 01:52:17,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie can push making further strides in her streaming career, not to mention her not-so-secret project.

1405
01:52:18,288 --> 01:52:19,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob can just live life.

1406
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:20,112
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did.

1407
01:52:20,132 --> 01:52:20,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't worry.

1408
01:52:20,913 --> 01:52:22,997
[SPEAKER_03]: You all have a...

1409
01:52:22,977 --> 01:52:48,428
[SPEAKER_03]: you all have a great time and enjoy life however you please you don't owe us an explanation we can only thank you again for every moment you gave us of course this ain't the end we'll still talk or chat to each other through whatever means we can and we'll support whatever new projects you are working on we'll see each other around and I wish you the best sorry if this was a long rambling nonsense but that's what I get for writing an email during the live episode and after two full days of playing Pokemon Go

1410
01:52:49,285 --> 01:52:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that event in Pokemon Go, by the way.

1411
01:52:51,027 --> 01:52:53,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 12 shinies across two days.

1412
01:52:53,249 --> 01:52:55,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Rob!

1413
01:52:55,411 --> 01:53:00,375
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, but in playing two hours of a community day, I can get as many shinies.

1414
01:53:00,715 --> 01:53:03,938
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I got two unknowns, and I love unknowns.

1415
01:53:03,998 --> 01:53:06,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably one of my favorites, so at least there's that.

1416
01:53:07,581 --> 01:53:10,824
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, thanks for the email, and I really do appreciate the words.

1417
01:53:10,844 --> 01:53:16,590
[SPEAKER_07]: To be clear, one thing I am going to lean into, because you kind of said Rob can rest, I don't know if I'll be resting completely.

1418
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,292
[SPEAKER_07]: For this year, yes, I will be resting completely.

1419
01:53:19,272 --> 01:53:37,095
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1420
01:53:37,075 --> 01:54:01,750
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1421
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:22,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll still be an individual contributor here at VOG and trying to you know outside of the shows we don't have a lot of meat on the website or on the YouTube right now so I'm going to see what I can do about that because that's something I can do on a timetable that works for me so there you go but I do appreciate the words I really do and I think I think yeah

1422
01:54:23,195 --> 01:54:24,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, keep going.

1423
01:54:24,717 --> 01:54:33,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, I think this is just going to be, you know, an evolution into a future that's not as gloomy as it seems.

1424
01:54:35,592 --> 01:54:41,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I'm making a big announcement next week for what's going to happen.

1425
01:54:42,213 --> 01:55:09,199
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah I am really trying to get into my streaming and I'm going to be splitting my time between my streams and ballet and the project that I hope people will be happy about that's all I can say about it because I don't do it just for us we do it for all y'all too alright are there any other emails or just the one?

1426
01:55:09,837 --> 01:55:26,412
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1427
01:55:26,392 --> 01:55:27,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it was 100, 200.

1428
01:55:28,334 --> 01:55:29,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1429
01:55:29,396 --> 01:55:31,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It was before all games, right?

1430
01:55:31,738 --> 01:55:33,741
[SPEAKER_07]: What episode did we merge with all games?

1431
01:55:33,841 --> 01:55:35,403
[SPEAKER_07]: That was around 200 or 300, right?

1432
01:55:35,763 --> 01:55:36,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like you were here before that.

1433
01:55:36,985 --> 01:55:53,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I know it's been a very, very long time, and I really appreciate the perspective that you've brought, Deft, because sometimes it's easy to have the blinders on being in the States and just walking into a superstore like a Target or a Walmart.

1434
01:55:53,905 --> 01:55:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

1435
01:55:53,965 --> 01:55:54,986
[SPEAKER_07]: humor me for a minute here.

1436
01:55:55,006 --> 01:56:09,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's lots of talks about where do we shop right now, but you know, walking into a store and seeing the games on shelves and it's a very different environment when you are in Mexico and you know, it's not necessarily as easy to walk into a gaming store and buy everything.

1437
01:56:09,483 --> 01:56:17,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Although it is ironic that finally, after all these years, I did go into a gaming store in Mexico at one point when I was in, I think it was Puerto Vallarta when I was on my cruise a couple of years ago.

1438
01:56:17,773 --> 01:56:19,635
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, it's, it's,

1439
01:56:19,615 --> 01:56:46,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for having me.

1440
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:47,714
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1441
01:56:49,236 --> 01:56:53,260
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a phone call coming on Discord, so I would love to bring this person on.

1442
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:53,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

1443
01:56:54,521 --> 01:56:55,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the phones.

1444
01:56:55,322 --> 01:56:56,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1445
01:56:56,303 --> 01:56:59,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1446
01:56:59,046 --> 01:57:01,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it is SSJ100 Matt.

1447
01:57:01,448 --> 01:57:02,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Matt.

1448
01:57:02,289 --> 01:57:03,470
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so good to hear from you.

1449
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:04,011
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?

1450
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:04,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1451
01:57:06,153 --> 01:57:07,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing all right.

1452
01:57:08,135 --> 01:57:12,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Figured, you know, next week is going to be pretty call busy.

1453
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:16,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine we're going to probably get a lot of

1454
01:57:16,298 --> 01:57:31,978
[SPEAKER_00]: old listeners, maybe, maybe not, but I'd like to call in towards the end of this show to kind of just talk, you know, catch up, just talk with everybody and just, you know, do I have video going?

1455
01:57:33,157 --> 01:57:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're not getting... Now you do!

1456
01:57:36,501 --> 01:57:38,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let me switch to the shot with video.

1457
01:57:38,824 --> 01:57:43,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh darn it, why does... Please boop that puppy's nose for me.

1458
01:57:43,791 --> 01:57:46,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I gotta fix the shot so we can actually see Matt.

1459
01:57:46,194 --> 01:57:46,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, not that shot.

1460
01:57:47,055 --> 01:57:56,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go... Anyway, while I fix things live, as I have to tend to do on this program, well, I appreciate you calling in.

1461
01:57:56,507 --> 01:58:00,312
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been with us a very long time, Matt, and I appreciate your...

1462
01:58:00,292 --> 01:58:01,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1463
01:58:02,034 --> 01:58:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1464
01:58:21,402 --> 01:58:23,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to use this opportunity, Matt.

1465
01:58:23,624 --> 01:58:29,571
[SPEAKER_07]: You've sent us a couple of bleats over on Blue Sky that I thought were really fucking funny.

1466
01:58:29,591 --> 01:58:33,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought I would read some of those for the listeners who maybe haven't heard these yet.

1467
01:58:34,115 --> 01:58:40,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one says, Did you know Orange Lounge Radio started its record run with its first episode on June 23, 2002?

1468
01:58:41,743 --> 01:58:47,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Later that same week, a young wrestler made his debut on June 27, and his name is John Cena.

1469
01:58:47,930 --> 01:58:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: John Cena's final match happens in December.

1470
01:58:50,877 --> 01:58:53,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Launch Radio finale will be November 23rd.

1471
01:58:53,062 --> 01:58:54,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about that?

1472
01:58:54,786 --> 01:58:55,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We made John Cena quit.

1473
01:58:56,109 --> 01:58:57,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Our impact.

1474
01:58:57,812 --> 01:58:59,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1475
01:58:59,476 --> 01:59:00,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty incredible.

1476
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,343
[SPEAKER_07]: John Cena got movies, though.

1477
01:59:03,746 --> 01:59:03,846
Yeah.

1478
01:59:04,113 --> 01:59:21,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, an OLR, did you know, if you add up every existing episode, including specials of OLR's record run, it's 2,742 hours, 14 minutes, and 44 seconds worth of content, thanks to the OLR archive.

1479
01:59:21,467 --> 01:59:24,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Although your autocorrect screwed you up there, but that's all right.

1480
01:59:24,312 --> 01:59:33,299
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were to listen to every episode non-stop, it would take you 114 days, 6 hours, and 15 minutes.

1481
01:59:33,841 --> 01:59:34,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's wild.

1482
01:59:34,904 --> 01:59:37,933
[SPEAKER_03]: No wonder I'm tired.

1483
01:59:38,555 --> 01:59:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and what's also funny about that, I don't think last week's show was up yet when you pulled that number.

1484
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:53,108
[SPEAKER_07]: So between last week, tonight, and if next week was a little... If we don't cross 27... 2750, we'll be really close.

1485
01:59:53,589 --> 01:59:56,992
[SPEAKER_07]: 2750 hours, I bet, we'll end up at by the time this all ends up.

1486
01:59:57,032 --> 01:59:57,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1487
01:59:57,752 --> 01:59:58,353
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be close.

1488
01:59:58,373 --> 01:59:58,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be close.

1489
01:59:59,494 --> 02:00:01,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, thank you for the stats.

1490
02:00:02,136 --> 02:00:03,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are fun to dive into.

1491
02:00:03,177 --> 02:00:04,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know what?

1492
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:08,562
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I did that was like, I was...

1493
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:39,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stuck late at work and I was like trying to think it's like you know like what are some like fun things because there was a show that I really like called Sports Science or something along those lines where they had like they did the science of a lot of sports stuff and I thought about like what are some fun OLR facts so it's like I was looking at some of that and the John Cena thing it's like oh that's fun that's a fun and the hours thing I was kind of like like huh

1494
02:00:39,642 --> 02:00:54,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder, like, if, and what I didn't write in the, what I didn't write in the bleat was, um, what if someone were to walk from New York City to LA, just listen to OLR nonstop, how many trips would that take?

1495
02:00:55,364 --> 02:01:00,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And, thanks AI, it came up with it, uh, one and a half loops.

1496
02:01:01,492 --> 02:01:02,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1497
02:01:02,879 --> 02:01:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1498
02:01:18,522 --> 02:01:21,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a bunch of episodes there.

1499
02:01:21,786 --> 02:01:26,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of the things that I kind of threw in there that were on the archive.

1500
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:28,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1501
02:01:29,456 --> 02:01:31,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Old episodes of DarkSakura's pump up the volume?

1502
02:01:31,859 --> 02:01:33,261
[SPEAKER_07]: That was once upon a time.

1503
02:01:33,721 --> 02:01:34,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Once upon a time.

1504
02:01:34,863 --> 02:01:38,708
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what my stream sort of is now because I just play music in the background.

1505
02:01:39,128 --> 02:01:40,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny.

1506
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:46,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we had things like Outside the Box or USL on there, it would be...

1507
02:01:47,885 --> 02:01:51,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, no, it's just like, you know, like, I fell down a rabbit hole.

1508
02:01:51,088 --> 02:01:54,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple other things that I kind of thought of that I haven't written up.

1509
02:01:54,772 --> 02:01:57,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll do that on a fun call next week.

1510
02:01:58,216 --> 02:01:58,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1511
02:01:58,676 --> 02:01:59,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterbirths, yeah.

1512
02:01:59,717 --> 02:02:09,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, no, but you know, like, like what I wanted to say to kind of back off of DevSea, I really started listening back, like, I guess 2003.

1513
02:02:09,828 --> 02:02:14,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, like, I moved out to go to college in Arizona.

1514
02:02:15,354 --> 02:02:16,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I didn't really have, like,

1515
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:45,583
[SPEAKER_00]: any friends, any community, nothing but like I had just gotten into DDR before I left for college and I found you guys thanks to DDR for you and you know I've just stuck around and you know I think we've talked about like legacy before and like the kind of like the things that this show has kind of left behind you know like a lot of people have been inspired by the show so

1516
02:02:46,762 --> 02:02:48,283
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun experiences.

1517
02:02:48,303 --> 02:02:52,727
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fun jokes that we've come up with over the years.

1518
02:02:52,847 --> 02:02:57,871
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may not have had the biggest audience.

1519
02:02:57,891 --> 02:02:58,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean we.

1520
02:02:59,012 --> 02:02:59,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not part of the show.

1521
02:03:00,494 --> 02:03:01,535
[SPEAKER_00]: You are, but yeah.

1522
02:03:01,555 --> 02:03:06,239
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not have broken a ton of news or been quoted on any of the major news sites.

1523
02:03:06,499 --> 02:03:10,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was the Katamari thing.

1524
02:03:11,163 --> 02:03:13,185
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's fine.

1525
02:03:13,205 --> 02:03:14,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1526
02:03:14,746 --> 02:03:16,127
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, like

1527
02:03:16,563 --> 02:03:18,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I would argue that we have one of the better communities.

1528
02:03:19,746 --> 02:03:20,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1529
02:03:21,188 --> 02:03:27,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes there are downsides about being a huge show, and this has been a really cool community, and it's really appreciated.

1530
02:03:27,754 --> 02:03:31,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate you being here as long as you have, and that's really neat.

1531
02:03:31,838 --> 02:03:39,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people – I don't know if a lot of people realize this, but even though this show, I kind of say, it was a spinoff of sorts of Under Station Live.

1532
02:03:39,886 --> 02:03:40,667
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no secret.

1533
02:03:41,688 --> 02:03:45,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Travis taught me that any idiot could podcast, and I say that lovingly.

1534
02:03:45,352 --> 02:04:11,022
[SPEAKER_07]: and this show went and then Travis moved to Texas so I no longer participated in the show regularly as I kind of went into this more often but you hosted Under Station Live for a minute because I remember Travis did that whole that whole like be a co-host for a month or so I thought it was a year be a co-host for a month uh and then you you won that contest you got to co-host with him for a

1535
02:04:11,002 --> 02:04:13,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny how things are full circle like that.

1536
02:04:13,365 --> 02:04:22,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I even came into podcasting because of Under Sedation, not just as a spinoff, but I was filling in, I quote, filling in for Jessica.

1537
02:04:24,056 --> 02:04:29,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody ever tell that man's ego I said this, but we're all a part of the Donovan cinematic universe.

1538
02:04:30,103 --> 02:04:33,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a question.

1539
02:04:34,448 --> 02:04:40,975
[SPEAKER_00]: So is Olar going to end with Rob waking up and Travis coming out of the shower like in Dallas?

1540
02:04:41,917 --> 02:05:06,068
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1541
02:05:06,048 --> 02:05:23,263
[SPEAKER_07]: and I will also be thankful to Travis it's not just this but also DragonCon was he now obviously yes Bobby was a huge part of that too with it being in his backyard but it was Travis that said fucking come I have a room you can stay in it you have you are now out of excuses

1542
02:05:23,243 --> 02:05:46,517
[SPEAKER_07]: and got me to start that down that path so um and then I was like why didn't you ever tell me about this it's a lot of fun so um yeah um but anyway I will say Ranma put together something a little cute for the final episode um so please look forward to it of course and like you know the show may be ending

1543
02:05:46,733 --> 02:05:48,135
[SPEAKER_00]: You know me.

1544
02:05:48,296 --> 02:05:50,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of one of your guys' good cheerleaders.

1545
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:54,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I will always support whatever you guys are doing.

1546
02:05:56,770 --> 02:05:57,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way.

1547
02:05:57,331 --> 02:06:06,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's like... At first I thought it was a sad thing, but it's like... I think I made the comment

1548
02:06:07,962 --> 02:06:35,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I replied to you with a clip from the last episode of Hannah Montana where she's walking out of the house and it goes, Yeah...

1549
02:06:37,510 --> 02:06:37,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1550
02:06:38,111 --> 02:06:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1551
02:06:52,647 --> 02:07:13,761
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1552
02:07:13,741 --> 02:07:31,395
[SPEAKER_07]: so I you know I yeah and we will all have projects you can continue to follow and we will all still be following all of you um because many of you have done spin-off projects as an example Ranma and um Anime Jam Session um

1553
02:07:31,375 --> 02:07:36,543
[SPEAKER_07]: and somebody opened their mouths last week and hinted that maybe Ranma is a part of what's coming up next.

1554
02:07:36,563 --> 02:07:42,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously, you know, it's great to be able to follow that sort of thing.

1555
02:07:42,813 --> 02:07:49,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen Spike and Slidekick in chat tonight and love those guys and appreciate their support over time.

1556
02:07:49,244 --> 02:07:55,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm a big fan of the Gameboy.org video game podcast and love the work that those guys are doing.

1557
02:07:55,093 --> 02:07:56,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know,

1558
02:07:56,603 --> 02:08:03,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Proud, proud parents will be watching you out there, not in a creepy way, but we'll be watching you do your thing and cheering you on.

1559
02:08:03,730 --> 02:08:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll all have our own things.

1560
02:08:06,493 --> 02:08:07,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie will tell you more next week.

1561
02:08:08,214 --> 02:08:11,297
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Matt's got a YouTube and maybe we'll open that up a little more.

1562
02:08:11,317 --> 02:08:11,578
[SPEAKER_02]: He does.

1563
02:08:11,598 --> 02:08:12,479
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see if it's up to him.

1564
02:08:12,839 --> 02:08:13,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.

1565
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:23,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, even though mine's live hosting, it's still, you know, if you're ever in the area, come check out a show and hopefully some more YouTubes in the future, you know, and that sort of thing.

1566
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:26,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So things I can do in five minutes.

1567
02:08:26,877 --> 02:08:30,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing, but I will, of course, be in chat and call when I can.

1568
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:36,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got funny puns, insights, comments, and stats.

1569
02:08:36,111 --> 02:08:36,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Stat porn.

1570
02:08:36,692 --> 02:08:37,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I try.

1571
02:08:37,093 --> 02:08:39,296
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

1572
02:08:39,456 --> 02:08:43,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always kind of tried to call in as much as I can.

1573
02:08:43,523 --> 02:08:46,327
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, I have such performance anxiety.

1574
02:08:47,008 --> 02:08:48,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Even right now, but it's funny.

1575
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:49,071
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stupid.

1576
02:08:50,975 --> 02:08:54,520
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I've known you guys for over 20 years.

1577
02:08:54,781 --> 02:08:55,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

1578
02:08:55,041 --> 02:08:55,963
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's silly.

1579
02:08:55,983 --> 02:09:02,753
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like, I've enjoyed the time here, and, you know, like, I look forward to the future, and you know what?

1580
02:09:02,773 --> 02:09:09,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if anyone ever wants to, like, listen to all our episodes, we have the archive.

1581
02:09:09,643 --> 02:09:10,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1582
02:09:10,184 --> 02:09:13,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, nothing's gone forever.

1583
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:15,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, nothing's gone forever.

1584
02:09:15,672 --> 02:09:19,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like in physics, nothing goes away, it just changes.

1585
02:09:21,164 --> 02:09:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: and I will hope I can see you if I ever come back to New York.

1586
02:09:25,672 --> 02:09:27,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you don't live in that area anymore.

1587
02:09:27,274 --> 02:09:30,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Married life moved you away, right?

1588
02:09:30,139 --> 02:09:31,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not as close as you used to be?

1589
02:09:31,722 --> 02:09:33,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm closer to Canada.

1590
02:09:34,447 --> 02:09:36,490
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, I don't mind driving.

1591
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:54,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, alright That's a four hour drive from me Well, that's not that bad If any of you guys are coming to New York I'm gonna tell you You guys are worth a drive I'm gonna tell you, I said, I'm not gonna go until they have some stuff on Broadway that I really want to see again And now that that Cat's Jellicle Ball is coming to Broadway What?

1592
02:09:54,961 --> 02:09:56,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you didn't know that?

1593
02:09:56,464 --> 02:10:00,030
[SPEAKER_07]: No Yeah, the Cat's Jellicle Ball is going to Broadway

1594
02:10:00,010 --> 02:10:29,325
[SPEAKER_07]: so I want to see that and I want to see there's another musical well the Romeo and Michelle is being made a musical but I know you're there Ranma but you're not the one on the phone right now yes I'll see you too I will see all the OLR listeners who want to hang out when I'm out there and I still would love to get back to MagFest don't get me wrong it's just it's a really bad time of year that they do that thing oh it is so you know but never say never so yeah I'd love to get out to another con out there at some point I don't know that I want to see that

1595
02:10:29,778 --> 02:10:30,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1596
02:10:30,162 --> 02:10:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with it?

1597
02:10:31,497 --> 02:10:33,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not the original.

1598
02:10:33,355 --> 02:10:34,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, it's not the original.

1599
02:10:34,537 --> 02:10:38,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, it's infused with the 90s Vogue scene.

1600
02:10:38,282 --> 02:10:40,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to hear about anybody not liking cats.

1601
02:10:40,906 --> 02:10:41,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not tell me.

1602
02:10:41,628 --> 02:10:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not say so in my presence.

1603
02:10:43,150 --> 02:10:45,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I will plot.

1604
02:10:46,936 --> 02:10:57,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I am excited to see a take on it from a culture that's finally getting its flowers all these years later because Drag Race has ripped it off in many, many different ways.

1605
02:10:57,592 --> 02:10:58,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really exciting.

1606
02:10:58,834 --> 02:11:02,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see the fusion of those types of things.

1607
02:11:02,279 --> 02:11:04,343
[SPEAKER_07]: My dog is afraid of cats.

1608
02:11:04,944 --> 02:11:05,345
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1609
02:11:06,728 --> 02:11:07,710
[SPEAKER_07]: My dog is afraid of cats.

1610
02:11:08,893 --> 02:11:09,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's different.

1611
02:11:10,796 --> 02:11:17,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Matt, any other thoughts you want to get out before we say goodnight?

1612
02:11:18,513 --> 02:11:20,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you guys.

1613
02:11:20,716 --> 02:11:26,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a quick call next week because there's going to be a lot of us calling.

1614
02:11:26,144 --> 02:11:33,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have something very quick, but what I do want to do right here, right now, is I have my dog right here for the podcast.

1615
02:11:36,759 --> 02:11:37,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, can you do me a favor?

1616
02:11:38,041 --> 02:11:38,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you wave?

1617
02:11:39,703 --> 02:11:39,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Wave?

1618
02:11:40,865 --> 02:11:41,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wave.

1619
02:11:42,107 --> 02:11:42,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wave to Olar.

1620
02:11:44,811 --> 02:11:45,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Olar.

1621
02:11:45,597 --> 02:12:03,910
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1622
02:12:05,206 --> 02:12:08,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I know about Spoiled.

1623
02:12:08,873 --> 02:12:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Matt, it has been an absolute pleasure and I look forward to continuing to talk to you.

1624
02:12:14,383 --> 02:12:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just one stop on the journey.

1625
02:12:17,168 --> 02:12:18,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So until next time, alright?

1626
02:12:19,492 --> 02:12:20,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, guys.

1627
02:12:20,434 --> 02:12:21,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, buddy.

1628
02:12:21,811 --> 02:12:44,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye!

1629
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:46,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I absolutely did.

1630
02:12:46,076 --> 02:12:48,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't, but it's Thanksgiving week.

1631
02:12:48,345 --> 02:12:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, that's going to be my pet project catching up on things I'm trying to get done in the workplace week.

1632
02:12:53,908 --> 02:12:55,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm all right with that.

1633
02:12:55,679 --> 02:13:00,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm going to be able to concentrate, to be honest.

1634
02:13:00,026 --> 02:13:07,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, the Sunday after that, I have my subathon to help make up for what I spent at TwitchCon.

1635
02:13:08,338 --> 02:13:09,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1636
02:13:10,762 --> 02:13:22,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I think plans are coming together for my first Sunday off, but I don't know for sure, so I won't say anything until probably next Sunday itself.

1637
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,403
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, I am...

1638
02:13:24,383 --> 02:13:25,945
[SPEAKER_07]: planning on a mini trip.

1639
02:13:25,965 --> 02:13:26,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll say that much.

1640
02:13:26,666 --> 02:13:27,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Mini trip.

1641
02:13:27,347 --> 02:13:29,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big trip, but a mini trip.

1642
02:13:29,609 --> 02:13:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have a new Sunday event that's going to happen come December.

1643
02:13:34,115 --> 02:13:37,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I am starting a new ballet class that's all stretching for ballet.

1644
02:13:39,421 --> 02:13:42,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it'll be interesting.

1645
02:13:44,066 --> 02:13:44,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling motivated.

1646
02:13:45,388 --> 02:13:46,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1647
02:13:46,309 --> 02:13:46,689
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.

1648
02:13:47,951 --> 02:13:48,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1649
02:13:48,532 --> 02:13:48,952
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1650
02:13:49,613 --> 02:13:53,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, are there any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?

1651
02:13:55,180 --> 02:13:55,641
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1652
02:13:55,661 --> 02:13:56,182
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1653
02:13:56,202 --> 02:13:58,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we hit on all the big stuff.

1654
02:13:58,686 --> 02:13:59,067
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1655
02:13:59,608 --> 02:14:05,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're at the end of the show, and this is where I would usually say, help us spread the word, tell everybody.

1656
02:14:05,958 --> 02:14:07,441
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, that is all still true.

1657
02:14:07,822 --> 02:14:13,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess this week it would be, help us find the people that used to listen to this show and let them know.

1658
02:14:13,852 --> 02:14:14,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring them back.

1659
02:14:14,513 --> 02:14:15,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week is the last show.

1660
02:14:15,395 --> 02:14:16,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still have a backlog.

1661
02:14:16,915 --> 02:14:18,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1662
02:14:18,418 --> 02:14:21,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week is the big OLR, the final.

1663
02:14:21,865 --> 02:14:25,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Really look forward to seeing you all here and doing this one more time for you.

1664
02:14:26,393 --> 02:14:35,771
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll let all the sappy stuff out next week, but it's really obviously been a pleasure over these last 23 and a half years and continued in a new form.

1665
02:14:36,332 --> 02:14:39,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So until we get to that point next week,

1666
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:41,520
[SPEAKER_07]: We wrap up this week.

1667
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:44,523
[SPEAKER_07]: So DarkSakura, I'm assuming you're streaming as usual tonight.

1668
02:14:44,884 --> 02:14:47,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a final thought or a final thing to say?

1669
02:14:52,332 --> 02:14:53,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I have things that I want to say.

1670
02:14:54,374 --> 02:14:55,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to wait for next week.

1671
02:14:56,076 --> 02:14:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1672
02:14:58,318 --> 02:14:58,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1673
02:14:59,159 --> 02:14:59,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, have a good stream.

1674
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:00,461
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time.

1675
02:15:01,061 --> 02:15:01,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1676
02:15:01,482 --> 02:15:02,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1677
02:15:02,123 --> 02:15:02,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1678
02:15:03,544 --> 02:15:03,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1679
02:15:04,505 --> 02:15:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, that takes us to you.

1680
02:15:05,927 --> 02:15:07,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Your final thought tonight.

1681
02:15:07,642 --> 02:15:16,150
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is that I hopefully will have my new streaming series ready to go by the time I'm available to start streaming again.

1682
02:15:17,058 --> 02:15:18,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, nice.

1683
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:19,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

1684
02:15:19,261 --> 02:15:21,304
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can have more time for streaming and stuff, be good.

1685
02:15:23,267 --> 02:15:32,820
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is it's a little surreal that I'm saying see you next week for the final episode, but it's going to be okay.

1686
02:15:33,340 --> 02:15:40,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long journey, but this is the next fork in the road that's going to lead to some awesome things for everybody.

1687
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:43,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next week for the big finale.

1688
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:45,762
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I got.

1689
02:15:45,782 --> 02:15:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, have a great night, everybody.

1690
02:15:47,304 --> 02:16:07,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1691
02:16:08,982 --> 02:16:18,663
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know they were all still true.

1692
02:16:21,428 --> 02:16:22,671
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.
