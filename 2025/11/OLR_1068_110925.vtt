WEBVTT

00:10.105 --> 00:13.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Why bother when we already have a battle net balance?

00:13.691 --> 00:21.423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to note that when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties.

00:21.443 --> 00:26.190
[SPEAKER_06]: This can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items.

00:26.170 --> 00:30.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Translation, we don't want credit card companies to prevent you from giving us money you don't have and can't afford.

00:31.002 --> 00:35.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Companies are in the business of protecting their ability to continue receiving income no matter the reason.

00:36.315 --> 00:41.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:41.647 --> 00:43.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.

00:45.644 --> 00:48.647
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:48.687 --> 00:53.012
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:53.032 --> 01:04.885
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live coming at you once again tonight, November the 9th, 2025, episode number 1068 of our program.

01:05.706 --> 01:13.575
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the last 23 and a half years, we've been joining you here every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and sometimes food.

01:13.555 --> 01:17.584
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my partners in Internet Crime.

01:17.684 --> 01:19.689
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:20.591 --> 01:20.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

01:21.132 --> 01:21.774
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, hello.

01:21.834 --> 01:22.235
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

01:24.360 --> 01:25.282
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a thing.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.464
[SPEAKER_11]: A thing.

01:26.605 --> 01:27.467
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a thing.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a way.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.070
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a certain way.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.458
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the way your VTubers dress tonight.

01:33.383 --> 01:34.184
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

01:34.485 --> 01:38.891
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing around with some of my Dead by Daylight textures that I have.

01:39.231 --> 01:39.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

01:39.992 --> 01:41.875
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we feeling about 2v8's return?

01:42.035 --> 01:46.702
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I don't want to get too much into your gaming week, but... I'll talk about it in my gaming week.

01:47.363 --> 01:47.964
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, fair enough.

01:48.344 --> 01:51.028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go and say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:53.311 --> 01:53.471
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

01:53.712 --> 01:54.152
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Loki.

01:54.192 --> 01:54.733
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

01:55.642 --> 02:15.372
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I didn't have...

02:15.352 --> 02:20.358
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's CaptainSparklez, he's a big YouTuber.

02:20.418 --> 02:27.687
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is, the game I just won the show in the back there is, it's a thing running in Minecraft, so it's called SoulSteal.

02:27.928 --> 02:34.776
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's like Sands of Time, it's made by the Nox crew folks who do MCC and stuff.

02:35.277 --> 02:37.680
[SPEAKER_08]: So they spun off, this is like a bedrock game.

02:38.352 --> 02:52.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I always forget that there are the ability to do games within a game or whatever in Minecraft, which is silly of me to forget because I've played them.

02:53.205 --> 03:03.995
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they had a special limited edition Sonic thing I remember playing for a hot minute, and I'm sure there's all sorts of community-built ones, probably just like ZZT or Fortnite.

03:04.035 --> 03:05.797
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just a million of them out there.

03:06.157 --> 03:08.359
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the time to sample them.

03:08.339 --> 03:25.791
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I got, the other day they sent me, I had like 10 keys to it or something, I don't know what those are supposed to be for, something to unlock stuff, I guess, and then also I get a creator tag because I've been in MCC, so that'll be fun.

03:25.940 --> 03:26.821
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good times.

03:28.304 --> 03:30.747
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll get into our gaming weeks here in just a moment.

03:30.768 --> 03:34.894
[SPEAKER_11]: But as usual, we'll start off at the top of the show here with our kickoff topic.

03:34.954 --> 03:38.800
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, lots of drama going around.

03:40.342 --> 03:42.506
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a game you're anticipating very much.

03:43.287 --> 03:47.494
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not anticipating it this much at this point because who knows when it's going to come out.

03:47.614 --> 03:49.296
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been like that for years now.

03:49.477 --> 03:51.660
[SPEAKER_11]: Brace yourself for mediocrity.

03:51.978 --> 03:53.680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it's not going to be mediocre.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.302
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it'll be a good game.

03:55.362 --> 03:55.683
[SPEAKER_08]: It will.

03:56.043 --> 04:05.435
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't trust any sort of date announcement for this game until it's actually out because it's just, it's moved so many times now that it doesn't matter.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.217
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes, that's what happened.

04:07.258 --> 04:20.955
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockstar Games let everybody know after the last time where they said, it's not moving again, it's not moving again, that, yes, the date has moved again and now has been pushed out even further now about a whole year away.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto 6.

04:23.174 --> 04:29.083
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they need extra months to polish and finish the game to the level that we expected.

04:29.123 --> 04:33.729
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be damn perfect when it comes out.

04:33.749 --> 04:34.170
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

04:34.530 --> 04:41.079
[SPEAKER_11]: Polish off all of those monetization systems that they're going to build into a multiplayer universe.

04:41.159 --> 04:46.587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they need to really even worry about that because they've already nailed that down.

04:46.607 --> 04:48.850
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think it's going to be

04:49.403 --> 04:54.229
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty amazing whenever it comes out, you know, at some point.

04:54.609 --> 04:57.693
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, just real quick, if I can get some comments from chat.

04:57.713 --> 05:02.699
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt says, they're pushing it back more and more to a future where 90 games are a commonplace.

05:03.079 --> 05:08.846
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you say that, but I did think about a little bit of interesting irony.

05:08.866 --> 05:10.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I think none of this relates to each other.

05:10.849 --> 05:12.551
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting irony.

05:12.571 --> 05:13.572
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we've

05:13.552 --> 05:34.834
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:34.814 --> 05:55.708
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:55.688 --> 06:01.316
[SPEAKER_11]: It's potential that a PlayStation 5 could be more expensive than it would be in November.

06:01.837 --> 06:06.343
[SPEAKER_11]: It is possible that the price of a PlayStation 5 comes down by the end of November.

06:06.764 --> 06:08.106
[SPEAKER_11]: So to be... I don't know.

06:08.206 --> 06:21.185
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an interesting sort of side effect, especially for people that maybe have been holding out on a PlayStation 5 this entire time until a new Grand Theft Auto game comes out, which I'm sure is more than non-zero.

06:21.405 --> 06:22.627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fair amount of people.

06:22.647 --> 06:23.468
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think...

06:23.448 --> 06:27.080
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't honestly see them... Here's my thought here.

06:27.682 --> 06:31.895
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think that they're going to raise the price of that game.

06:31.915 --> 06:34.122
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that they spent a lot of time on it.

06:34.383 --> 06:35.045
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's why.

06:35.106 --> 06:35.888
[SPEAKER_08]: Because...

06:36.509 --> 06:40.675
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be whoring that microtransaction stuff in the back end.

06:40.735 --> 06:54.092
[SPEAKER_08]: So to put an extra $10 wall there between the consumer and somebody that's able to purchase those microtransactions, it doesn't make sense because, one, they're going to get that negative stigma.

06:54.112 --> 06:55.294
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, oh...

06:55.274 --> 06:56.736
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, now it's going up to $90.

06:56.776 --> 06:57.077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

06:57.457 --> 06:59.200
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's going to be $70.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.642
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be $70.

07:00.682 --> 07:02.004
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's a given.

07:02.024 --> 07:02.204
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

07:02.224 --> 07:02.905
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably be $80.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.348
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be $80 for sure.

07:04.468 --> 07:05.089
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

07:05.549 --> 07:06.130
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.113
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even remember how much games are anywhere.

07:08.133 --> 07:08.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, $80.

07:08.414 --> 07:09.135
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Nintendo.

07:09.335 --> 07:10.557
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Nintendo, for that.

07:10.657 --> 07:11.378
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

07:11.618 --> 07:12.780
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so kind.

07:14.062 --> 07:17.808
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think that they're going to be the ones that push it more.

07:17.948 --> 07:20.051
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, certainly they could probably try to do that.

07:20.071 --> 07:23.937
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's a safer bet to just not do that.

07:24.177 --> 07:24.758
[SPEAKER_08]: Lose out.

07:25.953 --> 07:42.223
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

07:42.203 --> 07:58.120
[SPEAKER_11]: GTA can charge it too some comments in chat about the delay SSJ100Matt says a wise man once said nobody will remember if you fart in public everyone remembers when you shit your pants I think that's exactly how Miyamoto phrased it actually looking back exactly

07:58.100 --> 08:00.343
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody will remember the delays if the game is good.

08:00.383 --> 08:04.689
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bobby points out nobody remembers or cares how many times GTA V was delayed.

08:05.089 --> 08:07.933
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the end of the day, there's no complaint.

08:08.354 --> 08:08.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong.

08:08.995 --> 08:10.176
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not complaining about the delay.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Take the time to get it right.

08:11.438 --> 08:12.559
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure it's bug-free.

08:12.940 --> 08:17.606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the game is vast and there's going to be lots of things they have to look at.

08:18.187 --> 08:21.772
[SPEAKER_11]: But it does lead to the, hmm, what's that pricing?

08:21.812 --> 08:23.274
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that economic?

08:23.314 --> 08:26.719
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more money now that they're fronting for the game.

08:27.199 --> 08:27.820
[SPEAKER_11]: But

08:27.800 --> 08:33.768
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think, I mean, they've made what, a billion dollars off of Grand Theft Auto 5 Online?

08:34.369 --> 08:38.895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think they make a billion dollars every year at least on that.

08:39.616 --> 08:42.319
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an enormous amount of money.

08:42.339 --> 08:46.665
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna make their dev money back, and then some, so don't cry for Rockstar.

08:47.907 --> 08:50.230
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't stop them from acting...

08:51.155 --> 08:52.576
[SPEAKER_11]: A certain kind of way, doesn't Loki?

08:53.497 --> 09:10.994
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so there's a few, it's a kind of a, he said, she said type thing, or in the sense that you have a corporation saying, Hey, we, uh, we fired, you know, these 30 some employees because of Grossmink's conduct.

09:11.094 --> 09:17.280
[SPEAKER_08]: They were, um, they were essentially sharing leaks.

09:18.931 --> 09:38.239
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

09:38.641 --> 09:45.172
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly wouldn't be because of that, because according to the folks that are getting fired, they said that is the reason.

09:45.513 --> 09:53.046
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hypothetically, that public forum that you speak of is Discord, which actually I don't think is a hypothetical at all.

09:53.086 --> 09:54.649
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was called that it was Discord.

09:54.669 --> 09:58.175
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even seen any leaks yet of the game since the last time it was leaked.

09:58.235 --> 09:58.776
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's...

09:58.756 --> 10:00.039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the game, Loki.

10:00.059 --> 10:14.470
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what it is.

10:14.450 --> 10:35.479
[SPEAKER_11]: And what if that information, Loki, if we talk about this union and stuff, has nothing to do with the game at all?

10:35.459 --> 10:39.203
[SPEAKER_11]: It is what the working conditions are like for them to make this game.

10:39.303 --> 10:51.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Or potentially, maybe it's, you know, Hubbaloo about the game getting delayed or the game is going to be delayed and maybe some of the specifics on a very business scale as to why.

10:51.975 --> 10:56.139
[SPEAKER_11]: But not necessarily, you know, graphics, story, plot, play.

10:56.439 --> 10:57.180
[SPEAKER_11]: It's none of that.

10:57.781 --> 11:02.445
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hypothetically all the shit behind the scenes.

11:02.425 --> 11:10.095
[SPEAKER_11]: That lead to, you know, in some type of maybe union growing discord thing, because that's the place where a lot of people collaborate.

11:10.395 --> 11:13.119
[SPEAKER_11]: If it was 20 years ago, it would have been Slack.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.621
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's the same.

11:14.821 --> 11:20.688
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of companies I know are still on Slack, but off the clock, not as many people on that.

11:20.708 --> 11:21.970
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's...

11:22.304 --> 11:28.093
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when we talk about leaks, I don't think we're talking about character art and level design.

11:28.673 --> 11:35.003
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're talking about the project plan for release and how many hours that's causing us to work.

11:35.644 --> 11:36.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's that.

11:37.266 --> 11:39.970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's things that gaming blogs don't care about.

11:40.891 --> 11:41.612
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

11:41.753 --> 11:50.465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were in the Discord with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is the Discord apparently.

11:50.726 --> 11:50.826
Yeah.

11:51.228 --> 11:53.090
[SPEAKER_11]: So then that's it.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.553
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're talking about union-related things.

11:55.573 --> 12:00.478
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I can see where people are jumping in and saying this is a form of union busting.

12:00.879 --> 12:11.691
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets weird, though, because there's that perspective of technically a private Discord server still lives on a public cloud.

12:12.472 --> 12:19.159
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not taking Rockstar's side here, but that's where on paper they're able to do it.

12:23.307 --> 12:32.170
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

12:33.803 --> 12:58.832
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know well and the optics are pretty shitty too right we're gonna fire all these people number one because they're trying to form a union number two right before the game is set to release and we're in that final polish I know it's weird to say that about a game that's a year out but they still they have a long polish and phase so it almost makes it seem like thanks for your long contributions to this game you're no longer needed and now we have this reason to sack you here's what they'll do they'll

12:58.812 --> 13:09.987
[SPEAKER_08]: all they'll do is they'll just wait until the game awards which is literally in a month or so and then they'll just drop another trailer and they'll be like oh nobody will talk about this yeah yeah yeah

13:11.671 --> 13:13.233
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unfortunately.

13:13.253 --> 13:21.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you would... It's interesting you bring up the Game Awards because I feel like there was a lot of pressure last year for Jeff to kind of comment on the industry.

13:22.342 --> 13:31.111
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder, you know, and I guess this is a silly thing to say, but, you know, I wonder if maybe there will be something said this year, but I also think we already know the answer.

13:31.631 --> 13:34.915
[SPEAKER_08]: He sort of mentioned something like, what is that, Summer Games Fest?

13:34.935 --> 13:36.396
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like barely...

13:36.376 --> 13:40.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, basically saying, like, hey, look at what these indie studios are doing.

13:40.582 --> 13:42.245
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at all this amazing stuff.

13:42.665 --> 13:44.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was more trying to hype the positive.

13:44.749 --> 13:45.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because that's what it is.

13:45.950 --> 13:51.479
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to get up there on a night that you're trying to celebrate video games and say, wow, this industry is kind of going down the shitter.

13:52.140 --> 13:59.170
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of taking the negative side, you're taking the positive side by uplifting and saying, these indie games are great.

13:59.210 --> 14:02.255
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is... And by the way, this is why Claire Obscure is going to sweep.

14:02.655 --> 14:03.717
[SPEAKER_11]: I...

14:03.697 --> 14:17.241
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there is... It's not just the fact that that game is rock solid, but I think a lot of the ways that game was made, even though, yes, I realize there were certain outsourced teams involved and so forth.

14:17.281 --> 14:20.687
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of games that you hear about now.

14:20.707 --> 14:25.215
[SPEAKER_11]: At least it wasn't AI that are made.

14:25.636 --> 14:26.397
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

14:26.917 --> 14:29.585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of sad we have to say that.

14:29.645 --> 14:32.453
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, wait till a later story.

14:32.794 --> 14:37.146
[SPEAKER_11]: Just file that on a little index card in the back of your head because we're going to pull that later in the show.

14:39.185 --> 14:41.287
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, let's see.

14:41.467 --> 14:45.392
[SPEAKER_11]: Over at our Twitch chat, over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

14:46.873 --> 14:50.217
[SPEAKER_11]: So Bobby is pointing out some of the behind-the-scenes stuff about the union.

14:50.597 --> 14:55.022
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just about able to get to 10% membership to be able to collect a bargain.

14:55.362 --> 15:01.269
[SPEAKER_11]: They are now not close to the 10% membership anymore, and others are scared to join to get to that 10%.

15:01.609 --> 15:09.057
[SPEAKER_11]: That all plays into that optics that really, like, it makes this whole you leaked confidential information a real stretch.

15:09.037 --> 15:14.845
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if, you know, again, this is UK law from what it sounds like, not US law.

15:14.865 --> 15:17.629
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not going to, I mean, I barely know shit when it comes to US law.

15:17.669 --> 15:19.691
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to profess to know what's going on in the UK.

15:20.172 --> 15:31.627
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wonder if anyone takes this to a legal place to see what ends up, you know, if it is arbitrated or whatever, whether Discord, a private Discord is indeed a public forum.

15:32.248 --> 15:37.656
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be an interesting, because that's the whole technicality this whole thing is resting on.

15:37.676 --> 15:38.757
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be interesting.

15:38.737 --> 15:44.273
[SPEAKER_11]: SJ100Matt says, firing team leaders and managers throws everything out of whack as well.

15:44.293 --> 15:47.282
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows who they're reporting to and yeah, gonna delay stuff.

15:47.302 --> 15:49.067
[SPEAKER_11]: Just ask the federal government.

15:49.334 --> 16:16.219
[SPEAKER_11]: I added that last part let's see, Def says it's going to be hilarious to hear Jeff talk about the industry and how the workforce makes it happen and then give GTA a platform that's why I preface what I said this is probably a stupid thing to say but when's that stopped me before Bobby Blackwolf says this game was made by one guy with nine friends no bitch, that's ten people look

16:16.992 --> 16:20.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley is a pretty face, not a mathematician.

16:21.177 --> 16:24.060
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's allow him to stay in his lane, okay?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.284
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an adorable little Canadian man that's done a lot in games.

16:28.344 --> 16:29.205
[SPEAKER_07]: He just wants to host a show.

16:29.306 --> 16:29.686
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

16:29.706 --> 16:30.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let him host a show.

16:30.847 --> 16:39.577
[SPEAKER_11]: Adorable little Canadian boy wearing dad's sport coat hosting a giant game trailer exhibition on a big stage.

16:39.877 --> 16:42.460
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see Brian Seacrest do math.

16:42.693 --> 16:44.455
[SPEAKER_08]: He shouldn't have to do math either.

16:44.475 --> 16:47.420
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley is kind of the Ryan Seacrest of the games industry, though.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.882
[SPEAKER_11]: Just just marrying it.

16:48.902 --> 16:51.345
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a that was a very Linda Richmond type of moment.

16:52.126 --> 16:52.827
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the Clint.

16:53.208 --> 16:53.969
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a topic.

16:55.471 --> 16:56.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley.

16:58.615 --> 17:01.319
[SPEAKER_11]: The Seacrest of the maybe Jeff Keighley hosts Wheel of Fortune next.

17:01.339 --> 17:01.640
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.865
[SPEAKER_11]: Mish says my favorite games this year have been Dinkum.

17:05.886 --> 17:06.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Dinkum.

17:06.386 --> 17:07.688
[SPEAKER_11]: I hardly knew him.

17:07.921 --> 17:14.539
[SPEAKER_11]: Ghosts of Yotai and Tales of Shilya

17:15.076 --> 17:17.680
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what my favorite is.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.702
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played them all yet.

17:19.002 --> 17:19.523
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a minute.

17:19.563 --> 17:20.685
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a minute.

17:20.905 --> 17:24.130
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we still have Metroid Prime 4 is still going to come out.

17:24.711 --> 17:31.942
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have to do a follow-up at some point because as we all know, it's riding off into the sunset at the end of the month.

17:32.002 --> 17:34.866
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will be curious if Metroid Prime 4 lives up to the hype.

17:35.007 --> 17:37.250
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope as a Metroid Prime fan it does.

17:37.270 --> 17:38.572
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see.

17:38.592 --> 17:43.800
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like there's still some room for talk on what the best game of the year is.

17:44.438 --> 18:12.910
[SPEAKER_11]: although we should be getting Game Award nominees that'll probably be the headline our last episode because that's right about the week the week before Thanksgiving is when we get the nominees right because or is that that's right around the time the nominee the games have to come out but a lot of I think we know the journalists get advanced copies of those games so the eligibility window is like Black Friday but I think the nominees come out that week the week before Thanksgiving so um

18:12.890 --> 18:22.723
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, NSJ100Matt says, settling with those employees via lawsuit is cheaper than dealing with the union and GASP pay people well and fairly.

18:22.743 --> 18:23.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Ouch!

18:23.744 --> 18:27.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Truth detected.

18:27.049 --> 18:28.090
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else on that, Loki?

18:30.033 --> 18:32.316
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.

18:32.336 --> 18:33.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing more on that.

18:33.457 --> 18:34.138
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing more on that.

18:35.080 --> 19:02.472
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go to the Game Awards, oddly I don't think I'll be able to There's a lot of things going on at work and that's right in the middle of the week I'd have to take like two days in the middle of the week to like because I can't trust that I'd be able to fly down there so I'd have to drive down there I've been hearing so many horror stories It would be nice to go once, though I want to go to the Game Awards just to say I went so, I don't know We'll see

19:04.139 --> 19:16.596
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

19:16.778 --> 19:21.664
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play 2v8 for Dead by Daylight.

19:22.385 --> 19:37.926
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yesterday, just on my first match, I just was solo queuing it, just because, and met some really fun people who were group streaming and playing together, and they invited me in, and we had a really good time, and I now have new friends.

19:37.906 --> 19:52.928
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

19:55.118 --> 20:19.067
[SPEAKER_01]: P100 Pig

20:19.773 --> 20:36.499
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

20:36.479 --> 20:41.624
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I did not play any Avatar this week.

20:41.644 --> 20:42.625
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of didn't feel like it.

20:42.645 --> 20:43.406
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Palia.

20:44.627 --> 20:45.568
[SPEAKER_01]: I beat Portal 2.

20:45.948 --> 21:01.644
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've mentioned the crap going on with my hand, but it is hard to do fine control when a good quarter of your hand hurts from the bone, it feels like.

21:01.664 --> 21:04.647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really the tendon, but it feels like it's coming from the bones.

21:04.627 --> 21:33.958
[SPEAKER_01]: so I've had a hard time playing but I did manage to beat the game and I love that game but now I have to think of something different to play next week what else oh yeah I have to thank Ryan who Shay's a Scotsman for gifting me Repo I am going to be starting that before too long oh cute yeah so

21:34.192 --> 21:38.899
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to think of a different retro game for next Saturday now.

21:39.079 --> 21:42.704
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means using my brain and thinking and none of those things work.

21:44.426 --> 21:46.649
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I had good suggestions for you.

21:47.731 --> 21:49.033
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'll have some retro stuff.

21:50.354 --> 21:52.658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just have to go hunting.

21:52.718 --> 21:53.459
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll go to Loki.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.360
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

21:55.268 --> 22:22.423
[SPEAKER_08]: it's mostly been just trying to a lot of stuff actually I've been doing a lot of administrative stuff with the Minecraft server that I'm on so moving stuff around migrating our server to a different host server candidate stuff modeling a trophy for my Halloween decorating contest that I did um

22:23.163 --> 22:45.373
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah just playing Minecraft stuff and I did play a little bit more of the Once Upon a Katamari I'm having trouble having that game hold my interest though which is unfortunate because I really wanted it to be good it's just they put too many blockers in the way to make it fun I guess but I don't know we'll try it some more I'll figure something out

22:46.771 --> 22:47.052
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

22:48.354 --> 22:53.345
[SPEAKER_11]: For my gaming week, I've been continuing with Dragon Quest 1 HD a little bit.

22:53.425 --> 22:59.598
[SPEAKER_11]: Did not play much more of the Mortal Kombat theme because the game that's been sucking all my time, surprise, surprise, Diablo 4.

22:59.978 --> 23:01.041
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a reason for it.

23:01.441 --> 23:06.552
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of doing the equivalent of like Dark Sakura P100-ing characters in Dead by Daylight.

23:06.532 --> 23:10.857
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of going like as far as you can literally go in Diablo 4 with the current season.

23:10.877 --> 23:16.103
[SPEAKER_11]: I am like one or two quests away from completely finishing all of the season's quests.

23:16.123 --> 23:19.207
[SPEAKER_11]: That's far beyond the Battle Pass stuff that I'm already done with.

23:19.307 --> 23:23.011
[SPEAKER_11]: It's finishing like the most difficult challenges in the quest and unlocking like every reward.

23:23.131 --> 23:25.734
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never done that in any of the ten seasons.

23:25.794 --> 23:29.198
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always finished the Battle Pass, but never gone all the way to do the ultimate challenges.

23:29.178 --> 23:45.567
[SPEAKER_11]: This build that I'm doing right now, the Hydra Wizard, is so good that I am... Because there's some new items that make the Hydra Wizard super powerful, and I am two quests away from literally unlocking everything you can possibly unlock, including the most ultimate stuff this season.

23:45.547 --> 24:07.977
[SPEAKER_11]: Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 4

24:07.957 --> 24:17.507
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the fact that they do this limited XP and gold boost somewhat predictably is actually kind of ruining the game in a way.

24:17.907 --> 24:21.090
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for me now, I only want to play when that buff is active.

24:21.411 --> 24:22.452
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would I play otherwise?

24:22.972 --> 24:26.376
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't I play unless I'm getting the maximum amount of XP?

24:26.876 --> 24:35.365
[SPEAKER_11]: So Blizzard needs to, I think, rethink the way they're doing this Mother's Embrace boost because either they just need to do it all the time

24:35.345 --> 25:05.318
[SPEAKER_11]: which I know might sound wild but you know they've got another expansion coming they're gonna raise the Paragon level cap they're gonna be able to rethink you know how the XP distribution is or they need to just stop doing it all together except for like like one day Halloween and like other things that you know you would expect maybe the actual anniversary day things like that like otherwise they need to stop doing it this way because it's just as much as I love this game it just makes me go I'm only gonna play when that buff is up because that's when I'm gonna be able to maximize my time

25:05.298 --> 25:05.960
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

25:06.850 --> 25:14.519
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you enjoy actually playing the game, why can't you play at any time and when the boost is up and just playing for fun?

25:14.539 --> 25:16.061
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, and that's true.

25:16.161 --> 25:22.789
[SPEAKER_11]: And especially from a multiplayer perspective, like if some of the other people I know, like Grandpa Warcraft actually plays Diablo 4.

25:23.150 --> 25:28.476
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he wanted me to be like, hey, jump on and help me grind this boss loot, I'd do it, whether the buff's up or not.

25:28.897 --> 25:36.486
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just kind of go, the accomplishment I want to get is all the shinies, and the best way for me to do the shinies is during the event.

25:36.466 --> 25:52.197
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not to say I would never would I ever play the game the other times but I kind of go those are my times to play everything else that's on my backlog that's kind of why Diablo is more front of mind this week and maybe some of the other games took a backseat

25:52.700 --> 25:54.123
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

25:54.163 --> 25:55.625
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's pretty much it for my game week.

25:55.705 --> 26:04.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I may have something to show here in a minute because Alan was just at Costco and I just heard or I got the notification he just got home with the garage door.

26:04.481 --> 26:08.748
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know he bought me something as he sent me a picture and I was like, oh, I want that.

26:08.769 --> 26:13.577
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll show you all in a minute here as soon as I see it.

26:13.557 --> 26:16.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I did have one more thing I was going to mention.

26:17.482 --> 26:33.484
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was brought to my attention, thank you, DarkTetsuya, that Taki Udon, the guy that's behind the Super Station, it's like a FPGA emulation box that looks like a PlayStation 1.

26:34.705 --> 26:37.749
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were looking for homebrew games to put on it.

26:37.770 --> 26:41.134
[SPEAKER_08]: So I submitted Pixel Hoops number two, and it's going to be on it.

26:41.587 --> 26:52.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever he releases the hardware Holy shit, good for you, that's great Yeah, it'll be cool Is the hardware something on Amazon, or where will I get the hardware?

26:53.204 --> 27:06.463
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on Taki Udon's site, so it's retroremake.co Love that It's the Superstation 1

27:07.051 --> 27:15.804
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and Alan just brought me what he bought me at Costco, and it's another little mini arcade, although this one seems a little bit more durable.

27:15.824 --> 27:18.908
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a Sonic the Hedgehog My Arcade.

27:19.009 --> 27:19.229
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that.

27:19.249 --> 27:20.150
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just there yesterday.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.372
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's pretty durable, though.

27:21.733 --> 27:25.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike the other My Arcades, it has a more – that's why this is $10 more probably.

27:25.138 --> 27:30.305
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a more solid front to it to keep this weighted down so you can actually play it a lot better.

27:30.325 --> 27:33.270
[SPEAKER_11]: And that stick that's in there – let me get it better in frame.

27:33.290 --> 27:35.573
[SPEAKER_11]: For those on the podcast feed –

27:35.553 --> 27:42.364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a mini arcade machine, meaning the type that sits on yourself, or shelf, or on yourself.

27:42.605 --> 27:43.386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a big stick on it.

27:43.406 --> 27:50.478
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a big old stick that actually looks a little bit more like what you would see in an arcade, maybe of a baby style, and then some buttons on it.

27:50.498 --> 27:53.643
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says it has Sonic 1 and 2 are built into that.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I bought Sonic the Hedgehog again.

27:56.027 --> 27:56.308
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

27:56.368 --> 27:58.030
[SPEAKER_11]: But I actually, this is pretty cool.

27:58.391 --> 28:00.835
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many batteries this thing takes.

28:00.815 --> 28:03.460
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume it's still just a few double A's.

28:03.960 --> 28:08.929
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because the base is weighty and has that big control doesn't mean it's going to take more battery power.

28:09.430 --> 28:10.532
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

28:10.552 --> 28:12.555
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, that's my little special thing.

28:12.575 --> 28:13.457
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to set up later.

28:15.200 --> 28:15.460
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.163
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

28:17.724 --> 28:18.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

28:19.310 --> 28:24.336
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo Infinite, it's just about done getting updates.

28:24.356 --> 28:35.408
[SPEAKER_08]: So this next major update, Operation Infinite, will be the last update that it receives, which has been confirmed by Halo Studios in a brand new blog post.

28:36.089 --> 28:40.474
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, they have all their other projects that they're going to be working on.

28:40.514 --> 28:44.018
[SPEAKER_08]: They've teased multiple games in the pipeline.

28:43.998 --> 29:03.289
[SPEAKER_08]: and says as we look ahead your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals in hopes of succeeding expectations and delivering the best Halo experiences possible and the game of course is not being shut down it's just not being developed any further so you know make that kind of clear

29:03.809 --> 29:31.673
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah of course we know that Halo Campaign Evolved is coming as well and then there's also going to be some other games as well they're going to be shifting their their dev teams too so neat that's still being I completely forgot about Halo Infinite since you know I know when it initially launched it was rough but it's cool I guess it's been supported this long but

29:32.092 --> 29:34.415
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was supposed to be a 10-year game, Loki.

29:34.515 --> 29:36.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Halo Infinite, meaning forever.

29:37.278 --> 29:39.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, forever.

29:39.481 --> 29:45.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I guess four years is the new 10 years.

29:46.230 --> 29:51.797
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you think about it, like, you know... Can we apply that to Term Limits?

29:52.638 --> 29:54.099
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we apply that to Term Limits?

29:54.120 --> 29:56.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

29:56.847 --> 30:01.921
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all aged 10 years in this last four years, so it only makes sense that the game is done.

30:02.364 --> 30:02.605
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

30:03.412 --> 30:04.393
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

30:04.413 --> 30:04.873
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

30:05.074 --> 30:12.500
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would say sorry to the Halo fans, but we just had that news last week about the Halo, you know, reboot or whatever on PS5.

30:12.601 --> 30:13.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

30:13.141 --> 30:14.382
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on more Halo 4.

30:14.402 --> 30:14.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

30:14.963 --> 30:16.084
[SPEAKER_08]: You can calm down.

30:16.684 --> 30:28.796
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a, and that is going to be definitely a palette reset to, you know, see how this Halo thing kind of lands when everybody can play this no matter what they're playing on.

30:28.816 --> 30:30.037
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for Nintendo, I guess.

30:31.338 --> 30:31.478
Mm-hmm.

30:31.880 --> 31:00.807
[SPEAKER_08]: but it'll be very interesting to see how that sort of maybe resets how many people are active in Halo multiplayer lobbies except now that I'm saying that out loud I think a big sticking point of Halo the new one is that there is no multiplayer it's really only the campaign I'm thinking like the Don Mattrick quote you know where they're talking about like you know if you can't afford the Xbox One the Xbox 360 is for you it's like if you can't play Halo you know remastered or whatever it is Splatoon 3 is for you

31:02.761 --> 31:28.330
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh lord I had more fun with Splatoon 3 than recent Halo games That is a gross comparison You got Metroid Prime 4 I was going to say, it is, because Splatoon 3 is really fun Halo is out after a while I'd rather play Splatoon anyway

31:30.267 --> 31:32.110
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god, what was the crappy game?

31:32.190 --> 31:35.655
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Metroid spin-off, but it was like something Force.

31:35.675 --> 31:36.537
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just awful.

31:37.018 --> 31:41.084
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a PvP Metroid game, but didn't even call itself Metroid.

31:41.104 --> 31:43.047
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the Strike Force thing on the DS?

31:44.048 --> 31:45.431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, something like that.

31:45.451 --> 31:46.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Strike Team Force or whatever it was?

31:46.572 --> 31:48.295
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know, I remember which Strike Force.

31:48.555 --> 31:50.358
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Federation Force.

31:50.398 --> 31:52.782
[SPEAKER_11]: Numerous chatters popping in with that, yeah.

31:54.719 --> 31:55.159
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

31:56.380 --> 32:07.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I'm going to ask DarkSakura to get ready to pull that index card I had her set in her brain earlier in the show because we're going to talk about, unfortunately, Square Enix is making some layoffs.

32:08.371 --> 32:14.757
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a total surprise because I believe we had a headline a few weeks ago that was talking about this possibility that was going to happen.

32:15.257 --> 32:24.726
[SPEAKER_11]: So of course, Square Enix, and you know them through Final Fantasy, but I think it's important for this story to really understand they make a lot more than just Final Fantasy.

32:24.706 --> 32:32.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, for example, didn't Square Enix make, speaking of Splatoon-y games, didn't Square Enix make that game, oh god, Shane made me play it.

32:33.076 --> 32:33.897
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Foam Stars.

32:33.918 --> 32:35.079
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a Square Enix game, right?

32:36.120 --> 32:47.234
[SPEAKER_11]: So, they make a lot of games that you don't usually associate with the JRPG brand, which is exactly what you're gonna realize the rest of the story is.

32:48.035 --> 32:48.756
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

32:48.736 --> 33:00.888
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've decided that they're going to be laying off an undisclosed amount of employees, specifically North America and European publishing operations, as it looks to streamline all of that.

33:00.908 --> 33:06.374
[SPEAKER_11]: They already said in a presentation to investors that this was going to happen.

33:06.454 --> 33:17.325
[SPEAKER_11]: "...in the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency."

33:17.305 --> 33:22.995
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking to save about 19.6 million, that's 3 billion yen, from this restructuring.

33:23.015 --> 33:29.386
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to consolidate the HD Games publishing organization from 11 divisions down to 4.

33:29.887 --> 33:31.951
[SPEAKER_11]: I had no idea they had 11 divisions.

33:32.352 --> 33:35.497
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be very curious what that means for the games themselves.

33:35.517 --> 33:40.967
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, they are not disclosing how many employees that totals.

33:40.947 --> 33:58.585
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.

33:58.565 --> 34:04.310
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of mystique in what they're saying there with all that.

34:04.390 --> 34:12.758
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, granted, it sounds like they're going to take publishing a little more worldwide, which I mean, in some ways we do live in a worldwide market.

34:12.778 --> 34:21.386
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would anticipate that probably some things you see that are a little more outside the Japanese focus games are probably going to get hit a little bit.

34:21.806 --> 34:26.210
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, where's my Rad Racer 3 Square Enix?

34:26.470 --> 34:26.650
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

34:26.991 --> 34:28.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's...

34:28.552 --> 34:46.341
[SPEAKER_11]: where's our Chrono Trigger remake in the Octopath engine that has served them so well for like Live Alive and Dragon Quest and all these fucking other games so anyway YYR does point out granted Square used to make a lot of really great non-RPG games

34:46.321 --> 34:47.402
[SPEAKER_11]: Such as Rad Racer, right?

34:47.723 --> 34:50.826
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember when they were firing on all cylinders on PS1?

34:51.106 --> 34:55.151
[SPEAKER_11]: Bushido Blade, Einhander, Tabal, Urgeis, and others.

34:55.171 --> 34:55.772
[SPEAKER_11]: Great point.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.755
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably when we came up with 11 publishing arms.

34:59.075 --> 35:02.319
[SPEAKER_11]: D'Artizia says, there's a new one, blanking on the name.

35:02.339 --> 35:05.463
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Def says, where's Theatrhythm final bar for PC?

35:05.743 --> 35:07.164
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great fucking question.

35:07.545 --> 35:10.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Theatrhythm, I hope we still get more Theatrhythm.

35:10.448 --> 35:11.690
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.932
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to go back and play more, to be quite honest.

35:14.384 --> 35:39.514
[SPEAKER_11]: now here's something else going on kind of in tandem with this whole thing and that is that Square Enix is going to be using generative AI to automate 70% of game Q&A or Q&A not that kind of Q&A game quality assurance QA by 2027 this is interesting let's

35:39.494 --> 35:43.359
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually want to hear this out a little bit because I think this could be interesting.

35:43.379 --> 35:47.745
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be using Gen AI to automate 70% of Game QA.

35:48.747 --> 35:51.290
[SPEAKER_11]: This was all part of the financial results.

35:51.390 --> 35:57.058
[SPEAKER_11]: There is what's called the Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology using Generative AI.

35:57.078 --> 36:02.485
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they'll be doing is they're going to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.

36:02.525 --> 36:07.392
[SPEAKER_11]: And they hope to establish a competitive advantage in game development.

36:07.372 --> 36:10.836
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course, you know, AI is a pretty controversial thing.

36:10.856 --> 36:12.138
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that.

36:12.158 --> 36:15.261
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I'm, and this may surprise you.

36:15.722 --> 36:19.025
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little hesitant to dog on this right now.

36:19.045 --> 36:28.657
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think that I'm ready to dog on it when it needs to be, but I think we need to sort of see, because what's important to note, the layoff story did not talk about QA.

36:28.997 --> 36:30.819
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, that was publishing things like that.

36:30.859 --> 36:33.362
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was not specifically talking about QA.

36:33.342 --> 36:52.836
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this could be interesting if the part of Q&A is running certain game loops and exploring certain game loops over and over again that could be interesting to see how automation could accelerate that that being said Square Enix would be a much better company

36:52.816 --> 37:04.128
[SPEAKER_11]: if it were to upskill these particular workers that are doing QA right now to be able to fix some of these bugs that are maybe, let's say, the low-hanging fruit.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.370
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm grossly simplifying this, I will admit.

37:06.671 --> 37:10.375
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making this sound like a turn the graphics up on level three type of scenario.

37:10.395 --> 37:22.047
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I mean is that if they could actually provide more of these employees the toolkits to actually be helping to fix some of the bugs that AI identifies, this entire process would probably speed up significantly.

37:22.027 --> 37:31.328
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think something important as we all groan when we hear that AI is going to be doing the QA, most of this is outsourced anyway.

37:32.101 --> 37:55.797
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

37:55.777 --> 38:14.916
[SPEAKER_11]: AI to uh so we can fire people and lower the numbers I really truly believe you get what you pay for in that regard and if instead they were to let's have AI try to identify some of these repetitive game loops and and discover the low-hanging fruit so that our QA team can tackle how to fix the problem

38:14.896 --> 38:38.524
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, for sure, for sure.

38:39.533 --> 38:40.494
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

38:40.755 --> 38:45.102
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, like I said, I'm all for assistive, not generative.

38:48.106 --> 38:49.548
[SPEAKER_11]: SGO 100 Matt says, correct.

38:49.649 --> 38:57.300
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of Q&A is outsourced to different companies on contract jobs.

38:57.321 --> 38:58.082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

38:58.102 --> 38:58.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

39:00.037 --> 39:00.438
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

39:00.518 --> 39:12.854
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see what develops with this and what this ultimately means in the next couple of years, because I mean, it will be interesting if games are released with AI, whatever quality, and they're still buggy.

39:13.856 --> 39:17.921
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just going to be interesting to see what all develops from that.

39:17.941 --> 39:19.043
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

39:19.143 --> 39:22.227
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on and talk about and seven day happened this week, right?

39:22.528 --> 39:22.988
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura?

39:23.289 --> 39:24.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

39:24.250 --> 39:28.816
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Mass Effect holiday, except there wasn't much to celebrate this year, but a little bit, a little bit.

39:29.437 --> 39:29.537
Yeah.

39:29.517 --> 39:48.876
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:48.856 --> 39:54.565
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be set after the original trilogy, so we probably won't have Shepard.

39:55.747 --> 39:57.530
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to tell us which ending is canon?

39:59.934 --> 40:03.480
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a little bit of an update about the next game.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.962
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still in development.

40:05.102 --> 40:08.548
[SPEAKER_01]: EA and Bioware are still going to be pushing this out.

40:09.329 --> 40:13.075
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from a blog post by Mike Gamble.

40:13.055 --> 40:14.437
[SPEAKER_01]: He is quite insane.

40:14.457 --> 40:22.611
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at Bioware, but the team is heads down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect.

40:22.631 --> 40:28.100
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of universe to cover, a lot of features to build, and a lot of romances to figure out.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.462
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as Garrus is in it!

40:30.124 --> 40:30.464
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.

40:32.187 --> 40:33.409
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah...

40:34.874 --> 40:39.921
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're just trying to let us know it's still going to happen.

40:40.161 --> 40:41.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Still going to happen.

40:41.823 --> 40:42.845
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the TV show.

40:43.445 --> 40:51.476
[SPEAKER_11]: With all the news around EA recently, I appreciate the reinforcement because I think there was a part of that that maybe was in question a little bit.

40:51.496 --> 40:52.958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the reinforcement.

40:53.979 --> 40:58.165
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they're just going to be CGing the non-humans, you know.

40:59.967 --> 41:05.924
[SPEAKER_01]: or if the whole thing will be like a CG deal, you know, how are they going to do Turians?

41:06.204 --> 41:07.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Henson puppetry.

41:07.709 --> 41:08.330
[SPEAKER_11]: Make it happen.

41:09.373 --> 41:10.416
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want.

41:11.830 --> 41:13.572
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure that's going to happen.

41:13.592 --> 41:16.776
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, but let me live my fantasy.

41:16.796 --> 41:39.964
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, speaking of Jim Henson puppetry, there is something, look, if you are a gay man or live your life like one, let me tell you, there's something even more exciting in media that just got announced this week, way more so than the Mass Effect TV series, and that is that Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone are co-producing a Miss Piggy film

41:39.944 --> 41:40.666
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

41:40.927 --> 41:47.811
[SPEAKER_11]: That Cole Escola, the screenwriter and star of Oh Mary on Broadway is writing.

41:48.905 --> 41:49.866
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

41:50.447 --> 41:51.788
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, right?

41:52.449 --> 41:55.813
[SPEAKER_11]: Gay gasps heard around the world on that one.

41:55.933 --> 42:00.899
[SPEAKER_11]: That is gay culture, is that headline I just read to you.

42:03.682 --> 42:03.822
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

42:03.842 --> 42:15.976
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to know in this incredibly shitty year where my marriage may once again be up for debate at the Supreme Court that I have something to look forward to in my life, so let me have this Miss Piggy movie, goddammit.

42:15.996 --> 42:18.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me have something to look forward to.

42:19.550 --> 42:20.491
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.436
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I had a little asterisk as well.

42:24.456 --> 42:25.797
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a small N7 update.

42:25.857 --> 42:30.022
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't expect to be on Jamie's radar, but it was definitely on mine because it's a game I follow.

42:30.042 --> 42:37.170
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are a No Man's Sky person, the special Normandy expedition is back.

42:37.190 --> 42:41.776
[SPEAKER_11]: They launched it on N7 day and it's only running for maybe another week or so.

42:41.816 --> 42:43.718
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say it was maybe through the 18th.

42:43.698 --> 42:52.652
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't have your Normandy in No Man's Sky and you own that game, I would encourage, especially those of you that picked it up on Switch, I don't know if you've had the chance to get it yet.

42:52.672 --> 42:54.234
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that might be Mish in that boat.

42:54.254 --> 42:55.997
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some other folks out there.

42:56.497 --> 42:58.000
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to do it.

42:58.220 --> 42:59.963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fairly quick expedition.

43:00.123 --> 43:02.427
[SPEAKER_11]: And by fairly quick, I mean it's still going to be a few hours.

43:02.687 --> 43:04.069
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it at all.

43:04.792 --> 43:10.119
[SPEAKER_11]: I might... Well, if you struggle a little bit, I'll help you out.

43:10.960 --> 43:16.208
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't remember it being a super difficult expedition, but yeah, you're going to have to kind of get the feel of the game.

43:17.189 --> 43:22.116
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you can get to Normandy in No Man's Sky for about another week and a half or so.

43:22.736 --> 43:24.078
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you start the expedition.

43:24.158 --> 43:31.348
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually, you have to start the expedition, and then you might have another three or four days past the end date, but you want to get it started, if nothing else.

43:31.548 --> 43:32.790
[SPEAKER_11]: So just...

43:32.770 --> 43:34.953
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a courtesy announcement for those of you out there.

43:36.676 --> 43:45.289
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's still a Game Pass thing, too, if your Game Pass hasn't already run out with everything, which I don't fault you for if you let that cancel.

43:45.369 --> 43:45.669
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

43:45.689 --> 43:50.997
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, I believe, a Game Pass thing still, too, so you can get it in that ecosystem.

43:51.017 --> 43:55.885
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm noticing Bobby in chat says, I lost the rewards on PS5, so I might have to redo the expedition.

43:55.905 --> 43:56.946
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, there you go.

43:58.148 --> 43:59.570
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

43:59.630 --> 44:00.111
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

44:01.407 --> 44:02.929
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's talk.

44:03.610 --> 44:05.874
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like a misconnection a little bit.

44:05.974 --> 44:11.122
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there was a comment by Keanu Reeves a while back.

44:11.563 --> 44:21.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, not that far back, but basically saying he would love to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand in the next Cyberpunk game.

44:21.939 --> 44:29.170
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have, you know, the developers of said Cyberpunk game saying...

44:30.061 --> 44:33.368
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit us up!

44:33.388 --> 44:37.658
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully, hopefully we can make something work.

44:37.678 --> 44:38.460
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah.

44:41.486 --> 44:41.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

44:43.050 --> 44:45.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny Silverhand was an awesome character.

44:45.135 --> 44:49.825
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd love to see what Keanu Reeves could do for another game.

44:51.357 --> 44:57.368
[SPEAKER_11]: Keanu Reeves was that cyberpunk reboot through the bad and the good.

44:57.729 --> 45:05.123
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the whole announcement where somebody in the crowd had shouted, you're beautiful, and he goes, no, you're beautiful.

45:05.163 --> 45:05.824
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that, right?

45:06.145 --> 45:07.307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was.

45:07.287 --> 45:10.150
[SPEAKER_11]: Keanu Reeves really embodies that series at this point.

45:10.230 --> 45:13.113
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize it didn't start with him, but it's his now.

45:13.854 --> 45:19.640
[SPEAKER_11]: I do hope that if they continue with what's going on in the Cyberpunk universe, which I think they will.

45:19.720 --> 45:24.846
[SPEAKER_11]: I do feel like Cyberpunk's had enough of a victory lap of sorts between the Switch 2 release.

45:25.626 --> 45:27.268
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of redeemed itself.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.170
[SPEAKER_11]: As some video games get to do.

45:29.250 --> 45:31.372
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Cyberpunk's been able to run that victory lap.

45:31.413 --> 45:34.416
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that if they explore the future, they do it with Keanu Reeves.

45:34.516 --> 45:35.657
[SPEAKER_11]: Because like...

45:36.413 --> 45:52.414
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

45:52.394 --> 46:14.402
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:14.382 --> 46:40.373
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

46:40.876 --> 46:42.258
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what continues with that.

46:42.398 --> 46:43.600
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, it was breathtaking.

46:43.640 --> 46:45.743
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Mike Deft says you're breathtaking.

46:45.783 --> 46:46.284
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

46:46.584 --> 46:48.687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Neil Patrick Harris as well.

46:48.927 --> 46:50.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

46:50.409 --> 46:51.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike.

46:51.991 --> 46:56.257
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Spike, from GameBooey.org, Video Game Podcast.

46:56.578 --> 46:58.681
[SPEAKER_11]: So lovely to see you in chat.

46:58.821 --> 47:06.131
[SPEAKER_11]: Reminds that Matthew Lillard also had a role in the Twin Peaks reboot, which it was a small role, but it was an important one.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.453
[SPEAKER_11]: He was very good in that.

47:08.094 --> 47:10.377
[SPEAKER_11]: I support anything related to Twin Peaks.

47:10.357 --> 47:34.002
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't watched too much of Twin Peaks but I know my other cast members on Channel 64 enjoy watching Twin Peaks because it's strange and so there will be many nights that we are in voice chat together and he's streaming Twin Peaks for us to watch and it's strange and it doesn't make any sense to me but it's

47:33.982 --> 47:52.513
[SPEAKER_11]: I fucking love Twin Peaks I would encourage everybody to at least watch the original pilot and keep in mind you have to keep in mind in the back of your mind when you watch the pilot it aired on TV in 1989, 1990 I don't remember the exact day I think it was maybe early April 1990 I was in middle school and I tried to watch it in middle school

47:52.493 --> 48:22.500
[SPEAKER_11]: and when you watch it you're gonna be kind of taken with two things you're gonna be like this is very slow moving and very like intentional but also extremely unsettling it's extremely unsettling television and you kind of go this set the tone for so much more that's come after it there is so much that is influenced by what Twin Peaks did and you know and then if you ever watch the episode that reveals Laura's killer which I think we all know the answer to that now but I will I will

48:22.480 --> 48:24.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Let you have that.

48:24.423 --> 48:27.467
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know, I will let you have that.

48:27.487 --> 48:38.281
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say the whole sequence where that is played out and that is revealed is one of the scariest, most unsettling, most fucked up things.

48:38.301 --> 48:41.445
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot believe that aired on television, to be quite honest.

48:41.465 --> 48:43.508
[SPEAKER_11]: In the 90s, nonetheless.

48:43.528 --> 48:46.431
[SPEAKER_11]: It was event television.

48:46.451 --> 48:51.458
[SPEAKER_11]: The second season of Twin Peaks after that point...

48:51.438 --> 49:16.416
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:16.396 --> 49:18.239
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie's really not in a bad way.

49:18.339 --> 49:23.627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really like the topics and what's at hand is very unsettling.

49:23.647 --> 49:25.970
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you can get through it, the movie's powerful.

49:26.371 --> 49:34.603
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's one of those things that time has done that movie a lot of favors, like a lot of movies that sort of got rejected by audiences on the first go.

49:35.084 --> 49:36.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that's my Twin Peaks rant.

49:36.847 --> 49:38.790
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad I could get one more in before it's all over.

49:38.910 --> 49:39.911
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody should watch Twin Peaks.

49:39.951 --> 49:41.574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the best television shows of all time.

49:41.694 --> 49:41.894
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

49:41.914 --> 49:43.337
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

49:44.819 --> 49:45.019
All right.

49:44.999 --> 49:48.343
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, but Rob, Twin Peaks was on at 10 p.m.

49:48.383 --> 49:50.085
[SPEAKER_11]: You could get away with a lot in that time slot.

49:50.105 --> 49:50.566
[SPEAKER_11]: You right.

49:52.508 --> 49:54.912
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike says, it's intense, but so good.

49:54.952 --> 49:55.993
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie, Fire Walk With Me.

49:56.413 --> 49:57.595
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not get it as a kid.

49:57.875 --> 50:02.501
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, number one, you probably shouldn't have watched it as a kid, but I get it.

50:02.962 --> 50:04.083
[SPEAKER_11]: We all watch things we shouldn't have.

50:04.383 --> 50:11.713
[SPEAKER_11]: But number two, yes, a lot like would have gone over my head at that age that I think now it's like, oh, this is very disturbing.

50:12.253 --> 50:13.555
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway.

50:14.159 --> 50:39.998
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a proper Twin Peaks video game I don't not that I think that would I think like Alan Wake is the closest I'm ever going to get and you know I realize it also be really weird with David Lynch no longer with us unfortunately I feel like something not sort of endorsed directly by him would feel wrong but you know in a perfect world we would have got we will discover that he wrote a treatment for a video game before he passed but I just don't expect that that's the case

50:41.277 --> 50:41.978
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, now I'm done.

50:42.218 --> 50:43.140
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about Steam.

50:43.160 --> 50:49.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about the place that you could buy all of these video games that are hypothetical in my mind.

50:50.191 --> 50:51.974
[SPEAKER_11]: Steam is one of those places.

50:51.994 --> 50:54.598
[SPEAKER_11]: And Steam's been doing some updates lately.

50:54.618 --> 50:57.242
[SPEAKER_11]: They've done a few things recently and now they're doing another.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.965
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new look and feel.

50:58.945 --> 51:04.191
[SPEAKER_11]: Pages are now wider with support for higher resolution images.

51:04.431 --> 51:07.775
[SPEAKER_11]: So those of y'all with 4K monitors, Steam's catching up here.

51:07.795 --> 51:10.738
[SPEAKER_11]: New viewing modes for trailers and screenshots.

51:10.758 --> 51:13.501
[SPEAKER_11]: And now there's some new formatting options.

51:13.521 --> 51:16.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Pages have been widened to 1200 pixels.

51:17.325 --> 51:21.730
[SPEAKER_11]: That means now they can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page.

51:21.929 --> 51:29.745
[SPEAKER_11]: and there's a large pop-up view called the theater mode as well as a full screen mode for trailers and things like that.

51:30.518 --> 51:33.521
[SPEAKER_11]: No new look on the homepage yet.

51:33.561 --> 51:37.786
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just games store pages and bundle detail pages.

51:37.806 --> 51:51.480
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, considering Steam launched in an era where people didn't have widescreen monitors on the whole, and now I think widescreens have been the standard for quite some time, you know, and 4Ks are more and more.

51:51.520 --> 51:54.603
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not everybody has them, but there's still more and more than they were.

51:55.564 --> 51:57.066
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's...

51:57.046 --> 51:59.933
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably smart that the Steam store has evolved to match that a little bit.

51:59.993 --> 52:05.607
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the theater mode is really good, too, for the trailers and screenshots to really get a sense of what does this look like.

52:06.389 --> 52:08.575
[SPEAKER_11]: And plus, we're going to have a Steam sale in what?

52:08.835 --> 52:09.758
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Friday is what?

52:09.778 --> 52:10.560
[SPEAKER_11]: Three weeks away?

52:10.580 --> 52:13.346
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should have a Thanksgiving or holiday, whatever they call it.

52:13.667 --> 52:14.008
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

52:13.988 --> 52:17.137
[SPEAKER_11]: Holiday is going to be through all the end of the year events.

52:17.258 --> 52:18.722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.

52:18.742 --> 52:20.728
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there'll be a Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale.

52:20.748 --> 52:22.273
[SPEAKER_11]: There always is.

52:22.894 --> 52:25.221
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to think of what I might pick up on a sale like that.

52:25.261 --> 52:27.508
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think of what I missed throughout the year.

52:28.788 --> 52:49.125
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to get Claire Obscure because I'm letting Xbox Game Pass go so I'm probably gonna have to pick Claire Obscure is good yeah no I know I just didn't finish it so I'm gonna have to buy it to finish it I also I'm gonna have to buy No Man's Sky if I let Game Pass go because all of my unlocks are on Xbox although no it's cross platform with Steam isn't it maybe I don't have to let it go that would be nice

52:50.101 --> 53:06.118
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:06.790 --> 53:20.641
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I mean, basically there had been other spinoffs like Splatterhouse, One Paku Graffiti, but this was a Famicom title that was going to do an RPG called Splatterworld.

53:20.661 --> 53:23.888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was supposed to launch in March of 1993, but was canceled.

53:23.868 --> 53:28.755
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was promotional material that had been distributed.

53:28.976 --> 53:34.123
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese retailers had this information as of 1992, so it was pretty close to being finished.

53:34.143 --> 53:36.547
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we now have a working ROM.

53:37.268 --> 53:44.118
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced by West Mansion and uploaded to 4chan.

53:44.559 --> 53:50.027
[SPEAKER_01]: It works in FCEUX, which...

53:50.007 --> 53:55.535
[SPEAKER_01]: It works there because of a Namco mapper that they needed.

53:55.556 --> 54:02.907
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I checked it out, there was a fixed version, a ROM fix on it.

54:02.927 --> 54:04.349
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two versions out.

54:04.409 --> 54:06.212
[SPEAKER_01]: This was as of the first.

54:06.232 --> 54:08.515
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to test it out and see if it works.

54:08.575 --> 54:12.201
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can play Splatterworld.

54:12.417 --> 54:14.882
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's cool they made an RPG in that universe.

54:15.262 --> 54:15.743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

54:15.763 --> 54:16.465
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of awesome.

54:16.906 --> 54:17.567
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious.

54:17.587 --> 54:18.268
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super curious.

54:18.408 --> 54:20.112
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd play the shit out of that.

54:20.132 --> 54:20.733
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's a retro.

54:20.813 --> 54:22.236
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's what I should play.

54:22.917 --> 54:23.919
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very curious.

54:23.959 --> 54:25.742
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check it out if you do.

54:25.762 --> 54:26.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

54:27.987 --> 54:28.848
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on.

54:28.868 --> 54:29.129
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

54:30.732 --> 54:31.433
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

54:31.453 --> 54:32.856
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

54:33.764 --> 54:35.146
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about movies.

54:36.087 --> 54:40.573
[SPEAKER_08]: We know The Legend of Zelda movie is right around the corner and it is filming.

54:41.594 --> 54:44.458
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have started filming in, I know, New Zealand.

54:45.118 --> 54:49.424
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy that a fantasy movie... That's where all the pretty movies go.

54:49.544 --> 54:50.365
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where they all go.

54:50.425 --> 54:51.667
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

54:51.747 --> 54:58.135
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's started filming and yeah, I don't know... Do we have any...

54:58.115 --> 54:59.837
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any listeners in New Zealand?

55:00.217 --> 55:00.958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

55:00.998 --> 55:02.120
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have any live.

55:02.841 --> 55:05.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Podcast, do we have anybody in New Zealand that listens to this show?

55:05.584 --> 55:07.046
[SPEAKER_11]: And can I come stay at your house?

55:07.066 --> 55:09.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Because New Zealand looks really pretty.

55:09.288 --> 55:11.671
[SPEAKER_11]: We're always talking about all these movies.

55:11.911 --> 55:13.233
[SPEAKER_11]: This is gorgeous.

55:13.253 --> 55:15.515
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, imagine living there.

55:15.535 --> 55:19.680
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember Melon Punk Night, right?

55:19.720 --> 55:20.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

55:20.980 --> 55:22.382
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're moving to New Zealand.

55:22.502 --> 55:23.323
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they really?

55:24.344 --> 55:32.614
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew they were leaving their house in the place that it is now, not doxing my friends on air, but I did not know it was because they're going to New Zealand.

55:32.634 --> 55:34.135
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to New Zealand.

55:34.336 --> 55:36.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this like a get the fuck out of America thing?

55:36.498 --> 55:37.800
[SPEAKER_11]: Live in the dream, jealous?

55:38.240 --> 55:39.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think so.

55:39.321 --> 55:45.689
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very punk night thing to do, but hey, hey, I'm speaking from a place of jealousy.

55:45.709 --> 55:47.451
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that sounds amazing.

55:47.471 --> 55:47.771
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

55:47.931 --> 55:48.913
[SPEAKER_11]: I have somebody to crash with.

55:48.953 --> 55:50.194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

55:51.035 --> 55:51.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Make some room.

55:52.777 --> 55:53.638
[SPEAKER_11]: Uncle Rob's coming.

55:55.621 --> 55:57.123
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go see The Hobbit House.

55:58.565 --> 56:00.787
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the Zelda movie is still a ways away.

56:01.388 --> 56:02.810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I think, April 2027.

56:05.253 --> 56:07.095
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Grand Theft Auto 6 will be out by then.

56:07.656 --> 56:09.679
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is this a new game?

56:09.839 --> 56:12.502
[SPEAKER_11]: What comes out first, Grand Theft Auto 6 or the Zelda movie?

56:14.845 --> 56:15.706
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Zelda movie.

56:16.667 --> 56:18.730
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Zelda movie, actually.

56:19.385 --> 56:20.306
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know.

56:20.526 --> 56:21.147
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to say.

56:22.870 --> 56:27.235
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you interested in this movie that they're doing?

56:27.255 --> 56:29.758
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

56:29.778 --> 56:34.004
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're trying to figure out what game it's based off of, but we just have too little information.

56:34.404 --> 56:40.412
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually kind of hope, like similar to the Mass Effect TV series Jamie brought up earlier, I kind of hope it's actually not tied to a game.

56:40.953 --> 56:44.317
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, how would y'all feel if it was like an original story?

56:44.337 --> 56:47.581
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have all of these... It should be based off of the cartoon.

56:47.982 --> 56:48.042
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

56:48.022 --> 57:16.527
[SPEAKER_11]: excuse me princess I don't although if they slip that line in there somewhere even if it's just something like he utters under his breath you know what's gonna happen you put it in the trailer 40 year olds will lose their fucking minds it's gonna be a fucking chicken jockey moment if we get excuse me princess you know what you need to do I think the line's gonna be there but Link isn't gonna say it

57:16.507 --> 57:24.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, like give it to another character, like a shopkeeper or something type of character.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.518
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be interesting.

57:26.558 --> 57:31.303
[SPEAKER_08]: They really need to quote as much as they can from the CDI version of the game.

57:31.323 --> 57:32.604
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, just put them in there.

57:33.105 --> 57:33.846
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

57:33.866 --> 57:34.567
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obscure.

57:35.007 --> 57:36.028
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd make me happy, though.

57:36.088 --> 57:36.669
[SPEAKER_08]: Put that in there.

57:36.869 --> 57:38.150
[SPEAKER_08]: And excuse me, Princess, you got it.

57:38.431 --> 57:40.793
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yeah, what was that?

57:40.813 --> 57:41.314
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so hungry.

57:41.354 --> 57:43.216
[SPEAKER_08]: I could eat a, what was it?

57:43.596 --> 57:44.938
[SPEAKER_08]: An Octorok or something like that?

57:45.458 --> 57:46.159
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

57:46.325 --> 57:47.126
[SPEAKER_11]: from the cartoon.

57:47.767 --> 58:01.122
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually think the line in the trailer that would get the gas from the audience would be the old, like, it should start and it should be like this, you know, going into this very dark cave and it's very dark.

58:01.142 --> 58:05.186
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's this old man who's lit very, very subtly by fire.

58:05.206 --> 58:08.891
[SPEAKER_11]: And he just looks at the camera and says, it's dangerous to go alone.

58:08.911 --> 58:09.972
[SPEAKER_11]: Take this.

58:09.992 --> 58:11.894
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes into the whole thing.

58:11.914 --> 58:14.577
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's the line that would get people to be honest.

58:15.451 --> 58:16.452
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see, we'll see.

58:16.953 --> 58:20.719
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is going to be an art thing.

58:20.979 --> 58:26.927
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to shitify itself with all these references.

58:26.967 --> 58:30.012
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not asking you to just do this for the whole movie.

58:30.873 --> 58:36.361
[SPEAKER_08]: Less than 1% of the movie has this kind of crap in it.

58:36.401 --> 58:37.162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

58:37.503 --> 58:39.906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a silly nod.

58:39.886 --> 58:41.508
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a wink at the camera.

58:41.548 --> 58:43.672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, a wink at the camera is all we ask.

58:43.692 --> 58:46.135
[SPEAKER_11]: And excuse me, princess, you can get away with it.

58:46.155 --> 58:52.164
[SPEAKER_11]: You can fit it into the script and still have your arthouse film that gets Oscar nominations because I bet that's what they're ultimately going for.

58:52.184 --> 58:59.835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, if the, you know, whatever the D&D movie was, if they could have the animated team show up in it, then, I mean...

59:00.119 --> 59:01.781
[SPEAKER_08]: God, the D&D movie is so good.

59:01.802 --> 59:03.444
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we get a sequel for that soon.

59:03.504 --> 59:04.285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure you will.

59:04.305 --> 59:04.846
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so good.

59:05.467 --> 59:06.188
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so good.

59:07.029 --> 59:10.154
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I'm excited.

59:10.174 --> 59:12.478
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the story could be an original story.

59:12.518 --> 59:23.033
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the internet's focusing way too much on which game are they adapting without realizing that all the games, they all exist in the different parallel parts of the universe and timelines, really.

59:23.053 --> 59:24.936
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all these different timelines, right?

59:24.956 --> 59:28.101
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the movie should just exist in another timeline.

59:28.081 --> 59:50.629
[SPEAKER_11]: that can then maybe subtly tie itself to one of the games at the end or something but I think the movie should just exist in its own timeline because I think to adapt one of the games literally it's never going to be good enough for the internet it's never going to be good enough for the internet and it's not like the Mario movie had to adapt one of the games and it was fine so I would say the Zelda movie does its own fucking thing and it'll be fine

59:51.706 --> 59:52.928
[SPEAKER_11]: but one little wink.

59:53.148 --> 59:53.949
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we ask.

59:54.210 --> 59:55.191
[SPEAKER_11]: One little wink.

59:55.211 --> 59:58.576
[SPEAKER_11]: And then SJ100Matt says, the movie ends with the warp pipe showing up.

59:58.636 --> 01:00:00.760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and the invitation to the Smash Brothers film.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:01.100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:00:01.821 --> 01:00:03.364
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's not going to happen.

01:00:03.964 --> 01:00:08.271
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all are, you're putting the asks way up here.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.234
[SPEAKER_08]: You're putting the asks way up here.

01:00:10.294 --> 01:00:11.816
[SPEAKER_08]: That would just be weird.

01:00:12.477 --> 01:00:16.063
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless, yeah, it's just weird.

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:18.206
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless puppets.

01:00:18.626 --> 01:00:19.688
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked about this.

01:00:20.815 --> 01:00:21.256
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:29.660
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this other movie shouldn't have been animated, but... In all reality, though, I really hope that Link is mostly silent.

01:00:31.104 --> 01:00:31.887
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be curious.

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:33.692
[SPEAKER_01]: A man of few words.

01:00:34.193 --> 01:00:36.259
[SPEAKER_11]: Because men shouldn't speak.

01:00:38.264 --> 01:00:40.447
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:43.091
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about Atari 50.

01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:46.336
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, this game that keeps on giving, in a good way.

01:00:46.416 --> 01:01:01.639
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because, you know, obviously we had all these different digital eclipse collections that have spawned off of what Atari 50 sort of laid down, including the recent Mortal Kombat collection, which I heard got a patch this week, so I'm curious to see if it helped with some of the issues, but I've been too busy in hell and Diablo.

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:29.483
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:01:29.463 --> 01:01:30.925
[SPEAKER_11]: Galaga for $7,800.

01:01:31.306 --> 01:01:34.431
[SPEAKER_11]: Galaxian for the $2,600, the $5,200, and the Atari 8-bit.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.035
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man for the $5,200, the $2,600.

01:01:37.636 --> 01:01:40.841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the $2,600 version of Pac-Man being released again.

01:01:41.282 --> 01:01:42.905
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Atari 8-bit.

01:01:42.925 --> 01:01:46.110
[SPEAKER_11]: And Xevious for the $7,800 and the arcade.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.395
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the documentary part of this, I'm...

01:01:49.544 --> 01:01:54.528
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny, we all shiver or shudder when we think about the 2600 version of Pac-Man.

01:01:54.549 --> 01:02:01.154
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, it was a really like what they got away with in that cart size.

01:02:01.275 --> 01:02:08.601
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what I believe I recall the story going, the guy who programmed it asked for an 8K cart size.

01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:14.186
[SPEAKER_11]: But because that would have made the game more expensive, he got told, no, it has to fit into 4K.

01:02:14.827 --> 01:02:19.551
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he had to make the Atari 2600 do fucking party tricks left and right.

01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:41.269
[SPEAKER_11]: You said it was, was it also Inky and Clyde?

01:02:41.249 --> 01:02:44.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what and what surprises me is that it must.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:45.353
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, they were there.

01:02:45.453 --> 01:02:47.415
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have the personalities in 2600 version.

01:02:47.435 --> 01:02:48.976
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I was joking.

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:49.276
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

01:02:49.296 --> 01:02:49.516
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

01:02:49.837 --> 01:02:51.939
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wish they would put this side by side.

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:59.265
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess we have the 5200 version, which wasn't a more proper size card, but I wish they would put Pac-Man for the 2600 side by side with Ms.

01:02:59.325 --> 01:03:03.649
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man for the 2600 because that did end up in an 8K card.

01:03:03.769 --> 01:03:05.871
[SPEAKER_11]: And you see that it is a lot more arcade.

01:03:06.171 --> 01:03:11.256
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's still not perfect, but it's a lot more arcade accurate than the original Pac-Man was.

01:03:11.236 --> 01:03:31.557
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:03:31.537 --> 01:03:32.519
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:35.524
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:52.752
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:03:52.732 --> 01:03:55.877
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, looking in chat, YYR says, this is really cool.

01:03:55.937 --> 01:04:02.106
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite how awful the Atari 2600 Pac-Man was, I kind of want to see the interviews about that legendarily awful game.

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:03.127
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

01:04:03.147 --> 01:04:06.132
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's a very similar deal with E.T.

01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:19.211
[SPEAKER_11]: And hearing Howard Scott Warshaw, who made, you know, and you all know this is the infamous thing he always talks about, he made the worst 2600 game of all time, E.T., and he made one of the best Atari 2600 games of all time, Yars' Revenge.

01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:22.215
[SPEAKER_11]: There was other stuff in between there, too, like the Indiana Jones game and stuff.

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:37.032
[SPEAKER_11]: so um it's interesting to hear him talk about ET and how that game coming together as fast as it did was a miracle too and probably involved a lot of cocaine but I don't think he talks about that allegedly but I don't think he talks about that part um

01:04:37.484 --> 01:04:38.465
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's see.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:40.928
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions here or comments in chat?

01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:42.410
[SPEAKER_11]: S2100 Matt.

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:44.472
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

01:04:44.493 --> 01:04:48.758
[SPEAKER_11]: S2100 Matt says, if those glass coffee tables during those planning sessions could talk.

01:04:49.198 --> 01:04:52.222
[SPEAKER_11]: And PodCulture says, more snow than a ski resort.

01:04:52.602 --> 01:04:53.624
[SPEAKER_11]: You get it.

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:54.184
[SPEAKER_11]: You get it.

01:04:54.425 --> 01:04:54.765
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:04:55.586 --> 01:04:56.547
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go on.

01:04:57.368 --> 01:05:00.572
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we're talking about classic games, what a nice segue to our next segment.

01:05:10.913 --> 01:05:18.287
[SPEAKER_04]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:05:18.768 --> 01:05:23.156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:05:23.176 --> 01:05:24.359
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be a fun one tonight.

01:05:24.539 --> 01:05:27.184
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for the game of the week?

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:46.573
[SPEAKER_01]: Rise of the Triad

01:05:46.553 --> 01:05:54.127
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a first-person shooter that was developed and published by Apogee Software, now 3D Realms.

01:05:54.147 --> 01:06:00.258
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, you can play as one of five different characters, and each of them has their own attributes.

01:06:00.278 --> 01:06:04.225
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the fast one, the sneaky one, the enduring one, the strong one, blah, blah.

01:06:04.441 --> 01:06:15.400
[SPEAKER_01]: and you follow these characters through their story as they have to investigate a cult and then they learn about a plot to destroy the city.

01:06:15.861 --> 01:06:26.279
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a remake by Interceptor Entertainment and it was released by Apogee in 2013 and then there is a shareware version called Rise of the Triad The Hunt Begins.

01:06:26.299 --> 01:06:28.002
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into those in a bit.

01:06:27.982 --> 01:06:36.918
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little history is that it started as a follow-up game to Wolfenstein 3D, but was altered and became a standalone.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.184
[SPEAKER_01]: It has single player and multiplayer.

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:44.531
[SPEAKER_01]: You can connect with other gamers and tackle missions as a team.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:50.682
[SPEAKER_01]: It is powered by a modified version of the Wolfenstein 3D engine.

01:06:50.662 --> 01:06:54.716
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was supposed to be called Wolfenstein 3D to the Rise of the Triad.

01:06:55.719 --> 01:07:00.857
[SPEAKER_01]: That idea was scrapped by id Software and Apogee bought the license.

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:11.884
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway, you have to collect these keys as you go through the level, and you have to do different tactics and solve problems.

01:07:12.364 --> 01:07:22.137
[SPEAKER_01]: Your characters have different traits that depend on, you have hit point speed accuracy, etc.

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:50.335
[SPEAKER_01]: in the shareware version you only have one of the characters and he's set for a very average there are enemies that can beg for their life if they take enough damage or fake their death there are enemies that dodge the attack some try to ambush you it's pretty pretty intense and all of the enemies are digitized actors played by Apogee employees and relatives and friends

01:07:50.315 --> 01:07:56.663
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on those occasions, there are a large amount of gibs.

01:07:56.683 --> 01:07:58.365
[SPEAKER_01]: Ludicrous gibs!

01:07:58.385 --> 01:07:59.005
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get.

01:07:59.126 --> 01:07:59.786
[SPEAKER_01]: Ludicrous gibs.

01:08:00.768 --> 01:08:06.474
[SPEAKER_01]: As YYR just happened to say in that.

01:08:06.675 --> 01:08:09.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they're giblets.

01:08:10.039 --> 01:08:11.500
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, body parts.

01:08:12.502 --> 01:08:14.724
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

01:08:15.766 --> 01:08:16.947
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

01:08:19.002 --> 01:08:21.506
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go through, you have 13 different weapons.

01:08:21.526 --> 01:08:25.071
[SPEAKER_01]: You have bullet weapons, missile weapons, and magic weapons.

01:08:25.091 --> 01:08:26.773
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go through with all of that.

01:08:27.094 --> 01:08:29.898
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can only have one power-up active at one time.

01:08:29.998 --> 01:08:34.645
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the multiplayer called COM-BAT, C-O-M-M-B-A-T.

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:40.774
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have up to 11 players simultaneously, each with different uniform colors.

01:08:41.815 --> 01:08:45.280
[SPEAKER_01]: But in team mode, you have a single uniform color for each team.

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.423
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine different multiplayer modes.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.285
[SPEAKER_01]: Deathmatch.

01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:54.635
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a tag mode, kind of like the kids game.

01:08:54.815 --> 01:08:55.977
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a hunter mode.

01:08:55.997 --> 01:08:57.900
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the hunter and the prey.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.741
[SPEAKER_01]: There's capture the flag.

01:08:58.761 --> 01:08:59.803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few different ones.

01:09:01.085 --> 01:09:06.954
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, this started off as a follow-up to Wolfenstein 3D.

01:09:09.718 --> 01:09:10.339
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

01:09:12.293 --> 01:09:13.495
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like, okay, we're done.

01:09:13.775 --> 01:09:17.400
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Apogee bought what was left there.

01:09:18.281 --> 01:09:27.013
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the game, you know, they were going to use that same engine code for Wolfenstein 3D, new levels, art characters.

01:09:28.395 --> 01:09:37.727
[SPEAKER_01]: But as they were getting further into development, their project leader, Scott Miller, was contacted by John Romero, who...

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:40.455
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell Miller that the project had been canceled.

01:09:41.316 --> 01:09:45.642
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was... It didn't want to take anything away from Doom.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:50.329
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it went over and Apogee got it.

01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:52.492
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just removed all the Nazi stuff.

01:09:54.575 --> 01:09:56.998
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

01:09:56.978 --> 01:10:00.585
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, there's a lot more about that.

01:10:00.706 --> 01:10:03.151
[SPEAKER_01]: But there also is some cut content.

01:10:04.514 --> 01:10:07.019
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the enemies had female versions.

01:10:09.484 --> 01:10:17.400
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was going to load both sets of guards into the memory and then randomly determine what you get.

01:10:17.752 --> 01:10:24.038
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really made the memory requirements much higher, so they removed the alternates.

01:10:24.979 --> 01:10:28.702
[SPEAKER_01]: There are stills, though, that you can see of actors cut from the game.

01:10:30.344 --> 01:10:33.907
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other levels, like the Rot Reject level pack.

01:10:34.128 --> 01:10:43.877
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the stages that were cut from the game, and you can get that level pack to play them, and different artwork that you can find on the CD.

01:10:45.747 --> 01:10:51.706
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, the game was distributed as shareware, so the first episode was for free.

01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:53.833
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

01:10:54.944 --> 01:10:56.987
[SPEAKER_01]: It had 10 original levels.

01:10:57.027 --> 01:10:59.952
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Rise of the Triad, The Hunt Begins.

01:10:59.972 --> 01:11:01.615
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, there was those limitations.

01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:06.082
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, you could only play as one character, and there were only four of the multiplayer modes.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:18.201
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the deluxe of the shareware, which was retailed by LaserSoft, and it had three extra levels and three extra multiplayer that you could only play on their version.

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:24.308
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there were different versions of the full game too with three new episodes.

01:11:24.749 --> 01:11:30.599
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a floppy disk and a CD version that both had the 32 game levels and the three new episodes.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.666
[SPEAKER_01]: The CD version had more multiplayer levels.

01:11:34.686 --> 01:11:41.758
[SPEAKER_01]: The site license version had several multiplayer levels and you could play up to 11 different computers on a network.

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:45.914
[SPEAKER_01]: I have played this in this mode a while back.

01:11:46.575 --> 01:11:47.435
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago.

01:11:48.917 --> 01:12:00.128
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, Rise of the Triad was released on GOG.com through DOSBox, and so it can be played on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:05.374
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's playable on the current macOS.

01:12:05.434 --> 01:12:07.476
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that's Intel-based.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:17.047
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, Apogee released a reject level pack that was a lot of the cut ones, things that were unsuitable for the release.

01:12:18.929 --> 01:12:20.811
[SPEAKER_01]: This was released on July 25th, 1995.

01:12:21.552 --> 01:12:30.361
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could also play as Dopefish, who, that's my friend.

01:12:31.382 --> 01:12:31.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

01:12:34.165 --> 01:12:37.429
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate,

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.152
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, if you're listening, hi.

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:56.903
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there was an official retail of the level pack that was released by Apogee for the ROTT called Extreme Rise of the Triad, also in 1995.

01:12:58.486 --> 01:13:07.008
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the add-on was produced by a couple of people in the series.

01:13:07.068 --> 01:13:08.391
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is my friend Joe.

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:08.993
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Joe.

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:11.820
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other was Tom Hall.

01:13:12.661 --> 01:13:18.832
[SPEAKER_01]: But the maps that were produced in this are harder than the original ones.

01:13:18.932 --> 01:13:22.038
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some definitely tricks that were involved in making it.

01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:25.104
[SPEAKER_01]: These levels were released as freeware September 1st, 2000.

01:13:25.685 --> 01:13:36.745
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest of the remaining stuff was put out as freeware as ROTT Goodies Pack on February 15th, 2005.

01:13:37.197 --> 01:13:44.035
[SPEAKER_01]: um so there are other level packs um there was the laser soft deluxe shareware maps um

01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:51.817
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Apogee re-released those themselves after Lasersoft went out of business.

01:13:52.418 --> 01:14:03.796
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another level called Wolf 3D that was meant to see if the geography from Wolfenstein 3D could be replicated in Rise of the Triad, since it used the same engine.

01:14:05.959 --> 01:14:07.221
[SPEAKER_01]: There are...

01:14:08.399 --> 01:14:19.270
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the Ohio RTC pack that was a four level multiplayer pack that was designed for group in Ohio holding a game tourney called Bloodfest 96 um

01:14:20.178 --> 01:14:23.082
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one was called You and Spray.

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:30.653
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a gag, 1998, to play at the level editor.

01:14:31.354 --> 01:14:32.696
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was released in November 2000.

01:14:32.896 --> 01:14:43.772
[SPEAKER_01]: So the source code for Rise of the Triad was released under the GNU GPL 2.0 or later on December 20th, 2002.

01:14:43.752 --> 01:14:55.392
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it had been ported by fans to Amiga OS, Linux, Mac OS, Xbox, Dreamcast, PSP and Nintendo DS Homebrew and 32-bit Windows.

01:14:56.274 --> 01:15:03.887
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was included in the Fedora software repository so it was a free port.

01:15:04.559 --> 01:15:06.222
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the remaster.

01:15:06.242 --> 01:15:12.433
[SPEAKER_01]: 3D Realms did Realms Deep 2020 livestream and showed the game playing on a Switch.

01:15:13.215 --> 01:15:17.583
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would also play on Windows, Switch, PS4, Xbox for 2021 release.

01:15:18.545 --> 01:15:24.255
[SPEAKER_01]: At Realms Deep 2022, it was re-announced as Rise of the Triad, the Ludicrous Edition.

01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:37.631
[SPEAKER_01]: And the demo came out actually on June 19th, 2023 and was released on July 31st, 2023 and September 23rd, 2023 for consoles.

01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:40.774
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for the 10th anniversary of the 2013 remake.

01:15:42.616 --> 01:15:51.627
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the game is... A lot of people really consider this to be one of...

01:15:53.092 --> 01:15:56.336
[SPEAKER_01]: The games of its era.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.343
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone was super into it.

01:16:01.363 --> 01:16:04.547
[SPEAKER_01]: The iOS version was really not well received at all.

01:16:04.788 --> 01:16:06.590
[SPEAKER_01]: It got mediocre reviews.

01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:15.863
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the full version, DOS Spirit, Honest Gamers, PC Team, a lot of them were giving it... Next Generation gave it a 3 out of 5.

01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:21.310
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of folks just were really into it.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:43.737
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there as I mentioned there was a 2013 remake and that one was revealed at QuakeCon 2012 developed by sorry designed by Frederick Schreiber by Interceptor Entertainment and came out July 31st 2013 through Steam and GOG and that's it all right

01:16:44.999 --> 01:16:46.461
[SPEAKER_11]: One that I think I played briefly.

01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:49.826
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I played the shareware version of this briefly, but never really played the full thing.

01:16:49.846 --> 01:16:55.835
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, just kind of watching this YouTube, I go, oh, this is definitely a throwback to that era of first-person shooters.

01:16:56.156 --> 01:16:59.421
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Rise of the Triad, game of the week.

01:16:59.441 --> 01:16:59.781
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun pick.

01:16:59.802 --> 01:17:00.202
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep.

01:17:00.943 --> 01:17:01.364
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:17:02.105 --> 01:17:03.748
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have to tell Joe I gave him a shout out.

01:17:04.949 --> 01:17:05.190
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:06.231
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:10.738
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have just a few quick headlines here before we get into some release dates and the listener roundtable.

01:17:10.758 --> 01:17:12.561
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get to some fast headlines.

01:17:12.581 --> 01:17:13.943
[SPEAKER_11]: Rapid Fire News, The Loki.

01:17:14.935 --> 01:17:20.564
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man, it's like it's it's time just continues to repeat itself.

01:17:20.665 --> 01:17:21.546
[SPEAKER_08]: But here we go.

01:17:22.007 --> 01:17:22.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Year 2025.

01:17:22.628 --> 01:17:34.608
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the holiday season and Soulja Boy is out there just grinding and grinding by taking an existing product, claiming that honest question name on it.

01:17:34.748 --> 01:17:35.289
[SPEAKER_11]: Honest question.

01:17:35.349 --> 01:17:37.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Soulja Boy still relevant?

01:17:37.582 --> 01:17:38.705
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to sound shady.

01:17:38.726 --> 01:17:40.050
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just asking an honest question.

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:41.855
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Soulja Boy still relevant?

01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:43.741
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:17:45.246 --> 01:17:45.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

01:17:45.847 --> 01:17:49.920
[SPEAKER_11]: The comparison I was going to make was extremely unfair, so I'm just going to let it move on.

01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:59.926
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, he is attempting to take an existing device, a device that I actually own, by the way.

01:18:00.307 --> 01:18:07.401
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taking a device to the, was it the Retroid Pocket Flip 2?

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:08.223
[SPEAKER_08]: This one right here.

01:18:09.325 --> 01:18:11.149
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically...

01:18:11.129 --> 01:18:27.450
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

01:18:28.561 --> 01:18:30.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Vint got called out.

01:18:31.005 --> 01:18:36.773
[SPEAKER_08]: The Retroid team, the actual company developers, like, we did not authorize this.

01:18:37.815 --> 01:18:39.858
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know about this.

01:18:39.878 --> 01:18:42.302
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not any kind of official licensee deal.

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:46.348
[SPEAKER_08]: He does not have permission to rebrand our product and sell them as his own.

01:18:46.368 --> 01:18:49.813
[SPEAKER_08]: The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S.

01:18:50.073 --> 01:18:51.035
[SPEAKER_08]: by ourselves.

01:18:51.796 --> 01:18:53.138
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you cannot do that.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:54.400
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:58.256
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now he's marked them down.

01:18:58.296 --> 01:19:03.425
[SPEAKER_08]: They're now $200 on his site.

01:19:03.445 --> 01:19:04.066
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:05.689
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not going to be good enough.

01:19:06.551 --> 01:19:07.913
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to nail him.

01:19:09.897 --> 01:19:11.099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ridiculous.

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:13.603
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you just can't...

01:19:14.292 --> 01:19:15.815
[SPEAKER_08]: Is his brain just broken?

01:19:16.156 --> 01:19:18.060
[SPEAKER_08]: What is wrong with these people?

01:19:19.162 --> 01:19:19.563
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:19:19.744 --> 01:19:23.592
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually probably not that.

01:19:23.612 --> 01:19:34.275
[SPEAKER_11]: I find that typically, just in my limited experience with celebrities, but I've met a few over time, and more importantly, I've met the people they surround themselves with, that

01:19:35.572 --> 01:19:42.900
[SPEAKER_11]: really gas these people up one way, and then to the people around them, or the people that work with them, another way.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always this intermediary.

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:51.108
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually expect he knows very little about what's going on.

01:19:51.148 --> 01:19:52.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it seems like that.

01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.990
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sticking to it.

01:19:54.091 --> 01:19:57.115
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when he was showing off the console, he's like, look, see, it's got TikTok on it.

01:19:57.315 --> 01:19:59.217
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, because it's an Android device.

01:19:59.297 --> 01:20:00.478
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it has TikTok on it.

01:20:01.299 --> 01:20:03.101
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

01:20:03.782 --> 01:20:04.262
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this...

01:20:05.288 --> 01:20:09.413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... Who's making their purchasing decisions based off of Soulja Boy?

01:20:10.114 --> 01:20:11.576
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question, too.

01:20:11.616 --> 01:20:18.904
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are making your purchasing decisions off of Soulja Boy, you gotta really look in and reflect on yourself and see where you've gone wrong.

01:20:19.545 --> 01:20:22.549
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you are in dire need of help.

01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:25.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps reach out to family and friends.

01:20:25.252 --> 01:20:26.994
[SPEAKER_08]: You have lost your way.

01:20:27.855 --> 01:20:29.357
[SPEAKER_11]: Soulja Boy, you got issues.

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:31.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:31.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:35.003
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, can we get him to go on Shark Tank?

01:20:35.023 --> 01:20:36.825
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I want to see him pitch this on Shark Tank.

01:20:38.828 --> 01:20:40.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for the lulz.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:41.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Next story.

01:20:42.693 --> 01:20:47.279
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, next thing, a little bit more interesting, is Overcooked.

01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:57.131
[SPEAKER_08]: The crazy cooking game is now being adapted by A24 into perhaps a TV or movie.

01:20:58.072 --> 01:20:58.713
[SPEAKER_08]: TV series.

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.996
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be...

01:21:01.027 --> 01:21:20.385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how that would necessarily translate into like a cooking show, but Well, it's just going to be another knockoff of Hell's Kitchen It's just going to be people, instead of a chef screaming at people like Hell's Kitchen, it'll be them screaming at each other Hell's Kitchen and Wipeout together, you know, as one giant thing

01:21:20.517 --> 01:21:24.703
[SPEAKER_11]: Overcooked is one of those games that ends friendships like Mario Party.

01:21:25.024 --> 01:21:26.406
[SPEAKER_11]: I refuse to play it.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a perfectly acceptable stance to take, quite honestly.

01:21:30.472 --> 01:21:34.678
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played it, but it's, you know, people get very intense in that game.

01:21:35.379 --> 01:21:37.563
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it really depends on who you play it with.

01:21:38.965 --> 01:21:42.730
[SPEAKER_11]: If everybody's high and doesn't care, it's fine.

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:45.394
[SPEAKER_11]: If everybody's drunk and aggressive, not good.

01:21:46.336 --> 01:21:47.097
[SPEAKER_11]: Not good.

01:21:47.117 --> 01:21:47.217
Yeah.

01:21:48.698 --> 01:21:50.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, we'll see what happens with this.

01:21:51.608 --> 01:21:56.003
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, they're looking at doing something with TV and movies with it.

01:21:56.264 --> 01:21:56.886
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

01:21:57.305 --> 01:21:58.867
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, I guess.

01:21:59.327 --> 01:22:02.931
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, Deft in chat says A24 is behind it, though.

01:22:02.992 --> 01:22:04.013
[SPEAKER_11]: My stamp of approval.

01:22:04.153 --> 01:22:05.374
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fair point.

01:22:05.394 --> 01:22:06.235
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fair point.

01:22:06.275 --> 01:22:08.338
[SPEAKER_11]: A24 does a lot of cool stuff.

01:22:09.339 --> 01:22:13.303
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, I think Gordon Ramsay was connected to Overcooked for a bit.

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:14.244
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

01:22:14.264 --> 01:22:19.831
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what it is, is that Overcooked was inspired by like Gordon Ramsay cooking shows and stuff.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:23.515
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's it's you have this weird copy of a copy thing going on.

01:22:23.495 --> 01:22:39.647
[SPEAKER_11]: I still can't believe Hell's Kitchen is a show they're making.

01:22:39.627 --> 01:22:41.570
[SPEAKER_11]: How many seasons of that show has there been?

01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:43.714
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:22:44.796 --> 01:22:47.360
[SPEAKER_01]: As many as Gordon Ramsay wants to make money off of.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.847
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of Hell's Kitchen, but I don't... See, here's the thing.

01:22:51.908 --> 01:22:54.031
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of competition shows like that.

01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:57.637
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like them playing up the drama.

01:22:57.657 --> 01:23:00.522
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want a strict, like, hey, here's the teams...

01:23:01.683 --> 01:23:04.352
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool if we get to know them a little bit, you know, that's fine.

01:23:04.372 --> 01:23:08.124
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, I don't want all the, like, oh, all the drama.

01:23:08.144 --> 01:23:09.870
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want, like...

01:23:10.272 --> 01:23:11.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Just an actual competition show.

01:23:12.315 --> 01:23:15.159
[SPEAKER_08]: Treat it like the Japanese version of Iron Chef.

01:23:15.179 --> 01:23:18.945
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, I love the drama when it's Iron Chef drama.

01:23:19.726 --> 01:23:21.929
[SPEAKER_11]: When it's like the theatrics.

01:23:22.089 --> 01:23:22.951
[SPEAKER_11]: I think is a better way to put it.

01:23:23.051 --> 01:23:24.032
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the theatrics.

01:23:24.152 --> 01:23:25.254
[SPEAKER_08]: I love theatrics.

01:23:25.294 --> 01:23:25.554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:23:25.715 --> 01:23:26.476
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.

01:23:26.816 --> 01:23:32.244
[SPEAKER_08]: But just, can we have the theatrics and not the like... Which is why I miss American Gladiators.

01:23:32.364 --> 01:23:33.927
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss American Gladiators for the same thing.

01:23:33.987 --> 01:23:37.392
[SPEAKER_11]: The theatrics of that show was ridiculous.

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:37.512
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:23:37.492 --> 01:24:04.967
[SPEAKER_11]: MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef

01:24:04.947 --> 01:24:06.348
[SPEAKER_11]: MasterChef Kids.

01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:13.596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, completely different Gordon Ramsay because Gordon Ramsay is a very good actor.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:17.800
[SPEAKER_11]: And when he's doing Hell's Kitchen, he plays a part.

01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:23.426
[SPEAKER_11]: When he's doing MasterChef, he's probably a little bit more of his authentic self.

01:24:23.446 --> 01:24:26.309
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it's side A and side B. He's playing a different part.

01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:31.815
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to think that MasterChef Junior is a little bit more of his authentic self than...

01:24:31.795 --> 01:24:43.634
[SPEAKER_10]: The character he plays on Hell's Kitchen I mean, it could be vice versa, but I doubt it Twice as critical, twice as explicit You want to see one where the kids are put through hell, don't you?

01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:57.516
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all crying, he's like, I'm not leaving this set until you're all in tears And they're regretting the choices they've made in their short lives The wrong Gordon Ramsay showed up today Alright DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:24:58.576 --> 01:25:18.935
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had hinted at this earlier, but BioWare is insisting that there is still a new Mass Effect in development, that they are trying to make sure it fits into the Mass Effect canon, and it still would be itself a new game.

01:25:19.936 --> 01:25:28.043
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are very clear in saying that it's not, quote, a retread of Commander Shepard's story.

01:25:30.014 --> 01:25:32.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's all that crap going on with EA.

01:25:33.601 --> 01:25:44.140
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a little bit more going on because they announced that partnership with Stability AI for AI-powered tools for development.

01:25:44.421 --> 01:25:47.126
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're tools and not generative, that's what I say.

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:50.672
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean...

01:25:50.652 --> 01:25:51.373
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait and see.

01:25:51.794 --> 01:25:52.957
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy it.

01:25:53.037 --> 01:25:55.843
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mass Effect, and I'm a Mass Effect whore.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:57.406
[SPEAKER_11]: And how.

01:25:58.789 --> 01:25:59.109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:25:59.691 --> 01:26:01.354
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cool.

01:26:02.697 --> 01:26:05.202
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Garrus is currently calibrating and how.

01:26:05.435 --> 01:26:05.776
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:26:05.836 --> 01:26:07.819
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how to match what I'm saying.

01:26:07.839 --> 01:26:08.279
[SPEAKER_11]: He's calibrating.

01:26:09.361 --> 01:26:09.641
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:26:09.661 --> 01:26:10.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about this.

01:26:10.362 --> 01:26:16.251
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason references the intro tonight and he's talking a little bit about what's going on in World of Warcraft.

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:19.917
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, World of Warcraft is making a new expansion, which does sound pretty cool.

01:26:19.977 --> 01:26:21.099
[SPEAKER_11]: The new Midnight expansion.

01:26:21.139 --> 01:26:24.884
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, housing is finally coming to WoW, which a lot of people are excited about.

01:26:24.924 --> 01:26:28.810
[SPEAKER_11]: But uh-oh, we just found out about Hearthsteel.

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:29.591
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:30.913
[SPEAKER_11]: A new currency.

01:26:31.013 --> 01:26:32.155
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of currency?

01:26:32.255 --> 01:26:33.517
[SPEAKER_01]: Premium currency.

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:34.699
[SPEAKER_11]: For fuck's sake.

01:26:34.679 --> 01:27:01.092
[SPEAKER_11]: and Blizzard is saying that this new currency is supposed to be allowing you to do multiple items at once and offering this is my favorite part offering financial protections for folks involved you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table multiple place settings for your invited guests many candles using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient

01:27:01.072 --> 01:27:15.283
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance or of course in-game gold via WoW tokens because there's that whole thing where there already is the gold that you can turn into real money which has existed in Warcraft for some time.

01:27:15.955 --> 01:27:20.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so this was found from data miners.

01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:23.948
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard did confirm it, and people on Reddit are losing their minds.

01:27:23.968 --> 01:27:24.489
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see.

01:27:24.809 --> 01:27:41.777
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, and what has people concerned, and I get it, is that this is all being discovered weeks after we heard the story about Microsoft is pressuring all of their gaming companies, which Blizzard is one of now, to make sure you've got 30% profit margins.

01:27:42.803 --> 01:27:45.710
[SPEAKER_11]: They're called accountability margins at Microsoft now.

01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:46.572
[SPEAKER_11]: What a lovely name.

01:27:47.234 --> 01:27:48.898
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, something to think about.

01:27:48.918 --> 01:27:59.884
[SPEAKER_11]: I should point out though, World of Warcraft is still a premium MMO, meaning it is one of like three, I think, left on the market that actually charge a monthly fee.

01:27:59.864 --> 01:28:22.075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

01:28:23.118 --> 01:28:24.780
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:30.806
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth dream in chat says... I don't really have much of a desire to go back and play it again, although I do kind of sometimes miss playing.

01:28:31.127 --> 01:28:31.407
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

01:28:31.427 --> 01:28:32.909
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of like, I probably will.

01:28:32.949 --> 01:28:33.429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be honest.

01:28:33.449 --> 01:28:37.894
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably will check out the new expansion just because I enjoyed my time with this most recent one.

01:28:37.954 --> 01:28:42.840
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't stay subbed, but I subbed for two or three months to finish the expansion, and it was fine.

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.121
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the Dells.

01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:46.644
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious to see how they expand on that in the next expansion.

01:28:47.805 --> 01:28:52.230
[SPEAKER_11]: The housing thing, I don't get as into it as other people do.

01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:55.199
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a house in Final Fantasy XIV.

01:28:56.924 --> 01:29:01.337
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't really have a theme to it, so it is what it is.

01:29:01.357 --> 01:29:03.484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have any desire to go back to that either.

01:29:03.945 --> 01:29:04.988
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like...

01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:06.722
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

01:29:06.882 --> 01:29:07.724
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing Palia.

01:29:08.084 --> 01:29:34.519
[SPEAKER_11]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat is dropping the meme about Final Fantasy XIV with the free trial level 60 which is also just a really extended demo for that game but I will say in that game's case like the fact you get to it's Stormblood by Bobby you gotta update your meme it's not just Heavensward it's Stormblood now and up to level 70 but I would say that journey especially through Heavensward like Heavensward was probably my I don't know if it's my favorite but it's up there

[SPEAKER_11]: The Yakuza is a game key cart.

01:33:44.941 --> 01:33:49.626

[SPEAKER_11]: Busy, busy.

01:36:27.734 --> 01:36:30.617
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that takes us to the listener roundtable.

01:36:30.637 --> 01:36:38.764
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your part of the show for you to send us comments, questions, if you want to pop anything in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you're more than welcome to.

01:36:38.824 --> 01:36:42.788
[SPEAKER_11]: We also, I know we have a couple emails tonight, we'll get to those in a moment, and we'll get to some phone calls.

01:36:42.828 --> 01:36:44.249
[SPEAKER_11]: I see at least one call in the green room.

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:56.661
[SPEAKER_11]: I will just kind of, you know, remind folks, I think y'all already know, but we only have a couple episodes left after tonight, and the way things are shaping up, next week will be a pretty normal episode, but that will be, we will

01:36:56.641 --> 01:37:03.149
[SPEAKER_11]: We will end the normalcy on the nice number of 1,069, which I think is a great number to go out on.

01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:07.775
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will have one more, OLR the Final, on November 23rd.

01:37:07.835 --> 01:37:11.159
[SPEAKER_11]: The format of that show is going to look a little different.

01:37:11.339 --> 01:37:17.046
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll still talk about games, of course, but it's going to be a lot more self-referential, so we look back on 23 years plus of the show.

01:37:17.026 --> 01:37:26.977
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have ideas, things you'd like to see us do, I really invite you to join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord with anything you'd like to see us do for that final show within reason.

01:37:27.478 --> 01:37:28.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Get Reggie Fils-Aimé.

01:37:28.639 --> 01:37:30.321
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be things that are in reason.

01:37:31.182 --> 01:37:32.143
[SPEAKER_11]: But we look forward to that.

01:37:33.565 --> 01:37:34.626
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, I don't know.

01:37:34.666 --> 01:37:40.513
[SPEAKER_11]: You're probably not ready to talk about the successor yet, but maybe in a couple weeks you'll have some more information on that.

01:37:41.354 --> 01:37:44.738
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on a teaser.

01:37:44.887 --> 01:37:45.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

01:37:46.209 --> 01:37:47.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've settled on the name.

01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:49.152
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting everything together.

01:37:49.272 --> 01:37:50.434
[SPEAKER_01]: Even I don't know what that is.

01:37:51.135 --> 01:37:51.235
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:37:51.775 --> 01:38:11.099
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally need a little... I need some buffer time because this is... I'm not going to go too far into it, but it's very triggering for my... There's a condition called alexithymia where you feel so many things that you don't know what you're feeling.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:11.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:11.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

01:38:12.832 --> 01:38:14.454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I hear you.

01:38:14.815 --> 01:38:25.890
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take the rest of the year off before I even think about video creation or whatever I might want to do that's a different sort of time commitment in the future.

01:38:26.371 --> 01:38:29.415
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, I think from this year, I'm just so exhausted.

01:38:29.475 --> 01:38:30.837
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just like, I'm going to take the rest of the year off.

01:38:31.157 --> 01:38:31.958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm at.

01:38:31.978 --> 01:38:35.463
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't blame you if you wait a few weeks or whatever you're going to do.

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:38.768
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm excited to hear more about it.

01:38:38.788 --> 01:38:39.769
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

01:38:39.789 --> 01:38:41.151
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out on Thursday.

01:38:42.565 --> 01:38:44.247
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone, be jealous.

01:38:44.287 --> 01:38:45.148
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see Clue.

01:38:45.909 --> 01:38:46.209
[SPEAKER_11]: We are.

01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:48.271
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go see Clue on the big screen on Thursday.

01:38:48.772 --> 01:38:52.916
[SPEAKER_11]: Randomly, the Crest Theater here started showing, like, oh, they were doing, like, Labyrinth last week.

01:38:52.936 --> 01:38:54.478
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed cool old movies.

01:38:54.498 --> 01:38:56.981
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at ballet class, so I couldn't go to that one.

01:38:57.101 --> 01:39:00.845
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did Adam's Family Values, I think.

01:39:00.865 --> 01:39:01.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

01:39:01.025 --> 01:39:04.449
[SPEAKER_01]: But... But... But, yeah.

01:39:05.029 --> 01:39:05.670
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

01:39:07.895 --> 01:39:10.539
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little talk about the alexithymia.

01:39:10.659 --> 01:39:14.083
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's a comorbid with autism, so it's just a normal thing for me.

01:39:14.744 --> 01:39:17.167
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, flames!

01:39:17.187 --> 01:39:19.050
[SPEAKER_00]: Flames on the side of my face.

01:39:19.591 --> 01:39:23.496
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me get to some of these calls real quick, because we actually have a couple people in the green room.

01:39:23.516 --> 01:39:25.919
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to get to them, so we will bring some folks on.

01:39:26.259 --> 01:39:26.820
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.522
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:39:28.542 --> 01:39:28.923
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:34.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:36.153
[SPEAKER_05]: You called on me first?

01:39:36.173 --> 01:39:37.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, is that okay?

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:41.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I mean, it's fine, but I think there was someone else in the green room.

01:39:41.584 --> 01:39:49.754
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I just looked and I saw both you and I pulled... Well, you both get your turn, so what's up?

01:39:49.774 --> 01:39:54.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I called in because... Oh, first of all, hi, it's Aaron.

01:39:54.659 --> 01:39:54.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

01:39:56.922 --> 01:39:57.502
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Flynn.

01:39:58.323 --> 01:39:58.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

01:40:00.105 --> 01:40:00.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, LR.

01:40:03.509 --> 01:40:06.893
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually thinking of emailing just to say hello, LR.

01:40:07.328 --> 01:40:17.305
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:17.639 --> 01:40:46.178
[SPEAKER_05]: AJ called in asking about DDR tournaments and I figured I would go ahead and let you know that DDR tournaments are still a thing that is happening quite regularly in fact and I myself against my better judgment have decided to jump in and enter one yeah this coming February in Pennsylvania and

01:40:46.613 --> 01:40:55.459
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, looking forward to it and I wanted to go ahead and let you know what a modern DDR tournament looks like.

01:40:57.397 --> 01:40:58.018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please.

01:40:58.058 --> 01:41:03.963
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my cameras are all messed up and I don't know why, but we're going to adjust that on the fly while you tell us about tournaments.

01:41:03.983 --> 01:41:09.888
[SPEAKER_11]: Because yes, I can't believe I didn't think to talk about that tournaments are still a thing.

01:41:10.409 --> 01:41:12.110
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I judged one a few years ago.

01:41:12.150 --> 01:41:13.531
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't that long ago I judged one.

01:41:13.551 --> 01:41:16.294
[SPEAKER_11]: It was called Freestyle Takeover or something like that.

01:41:16.374 --> 01:41:19.717
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know they were setting it up to keep it going, but I don't know.

01:41:20.117 --> 01:41:22.740
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was trying to look up the current status of that here on the West Coast.

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.321
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, they're still going.

01:41:24.341 --> 01:41:26.543
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell us about what's going on in your part of the country.

01:41:27.434 --> 01:41:35.268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so actually this is a pretty common format that a lot of the larger tournaments are using.

01:41:35.688 --> 01:41:43.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, you don't see much in the way of freestyle tournaments anymore, but what you do see is this sort of format that this is.

01:41:43.322 --> 01:41:49.813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obviously accuracy-based, of course, but...

01:41:49.793 --> 01:42:02.570
[SPEAKER_05]: They've solved a lot of the issues of the past, like, you know, a whole bunch of people entering, you play a match and then you have to wait like six hours or until the next day for your next match.

01:42:03.732 --> 01:42:09.339
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, possibly getting destroyed in one match and you're done.

01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:19.733
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, a lot of these issues have been fixed by the current format, which is referred to as Waterfall Gauntlet.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:27.387
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also seen Waterfall Round Robin, but this Waterfall format is pretty popular.

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:40.140
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what that is, like if you were to play classic Mortal Kombat, you know how when you start the game it shows, okay, here's the battle plan, and it shows you the ladder that you have to climb up.

01:42:40.861 --> 01:42:46.547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically think of that ladder as a series of player pools.

01:42:47.033 --> 01:42:54.945
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on your performance in the qualifier, which actually happens in the months leading up to the tournament.

01:42:54.965 --> 01:42:58.110
[SPEAKER_05]: And you basically play the qualifier whenever you want.

01:42:58.150 --> 01:43:01.335
[SPEAKER_05]: You can submit as many tries as you want.

01:43:01.355 --> 01:43:07.063
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically your best score on a number of songs that you submit screenshots of.

01:43:07.083 --> 01:43:16.197
[SPEAKER_05]: And then depending on your rank in the qualifier, you're seeded into a pool somewhere on some rung of this ladder.

01:43:16.177 --> 01:43:35.434
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the way it works is the bottom pool is and all the pools are like four to six players so the bottom pool runs first and generally either you have a round robin format where everyone plays against everyone else and you see who gets the most wins

01:43:35.701 --> 01:44:05.168
[SPEAKER_05]: or you have a gauntlet format which is what I'm doing where everyone plays the same set of five songs in my case and highest EX score is what you're competing for and then the top two players I keep forgetting EX score is like a standard now I keep forgetting that that kind of switched a few years ago it makes a much bigger difference now because the skill level of the players is so much higher

01:44:05.148 --> 01:44:09.955
[SPEAKER_05]: You want there to be a bigger difference in score between Marvelous and Perfect.

01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:15.062
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what you get with EX score, with Marvelous being worth 3 and Perfect worth 2.

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:24.535
[SPEAKER_05]: As opposed to the regular scoring system where Marv and Perfect are basically the same and then Grade is far lower.

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:25.977
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, yes.

01:44:25.997 --> 01:44:28.320
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally what you have is...

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:36.337
[SPEAKER_05]: You compete with the players in your pool and the top two move on to the next pool and everyone else is out.

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:42.310
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, basically you can fight your way up so long as you keep

01:44:43.117 --> 01:45:08.770
[SPEAKER_05]: you know dominating your pool and then you're eliminated but what's nice about this format is you play your matches and then you you know if you do well you continue playing and then you're not waiting around until the next day or five hours or whatever for your next matches if you're you know if you keep going you play imminently you're when you're out you're out

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:26.387
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

01:45:26.367 --> 01:45:46.941
[SPEAKER_05]: and if you're seated you know maybe not where you should have been in the qualifier you have the opportunity to move up the ladder which I mean it's exciting to watch and to do of course so yeah it's something I'm very much looking forward to I haven't competed in a DDR tournament in

01:45:46.921 --> 01:46:12.152
[SPEAKER_05]: You go show them kids.

01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:14.071
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

01:46:14.091 --> 01:46:15.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to show them something.

01:46:15.994 --> 01:46:19.600
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be something laughable, but it will be something indeed.

01:46:20.963 --> 01:46:24.830
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am planning to do the birthday challenge again.

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:32.183
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're really bored, I'm not doing it next weekend because I'm going to be traveling, but probably the weekend after that.

01:46:32.163 --> 01:46:51.015
[SPEAKER_05]: if you want to see me play Max 346 times I'll be there it probably is going to be earlier in the day perhaps the same day as the final episode of this show so yeah have fun if you want to watch that

01:46:51.282 --> 01:46:55.415
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, YYR, thank you, of course, for calling in.

01:46:55.515 --> 01:46:57.782
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to let you go so we get to, as you know, somebody else is waiting.

01:46:57.802 --> 01:47:02.777
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a couple emails as well, but anything else you want to let off before you go?

01:47:03.905 --> 01:47:10.393
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry that I couldn't get the new version of Bungie Ferret Tossing ready in time for this.

01:47:10.733 --> 01:47:11.975
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't apologize for that.

01:47:11.995 --> 01:47:12.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Focus on that.

01:47:13.617 --> 01:47:15.139
[SPEAKER_11]: It is what it is.

01:47:15.399 --> 01:47:17.742
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, remember, we're not dying.

01:47:17.762 --> 01:47:18.463
[SPEAKER_11]: I will still be.

01:47:18.543 --> 01:47:23.449
[SPEAKER_11]: If you decide to re-release Bungie Ferret Tossing at some point, I'll still love to play it and hype it where I can.

01:47:25.691 --> 01:47:27.674
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be another avenue.

01:47:27.694 --> 01:47:28.815
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

01:47:29.791 --> 01:47:30.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

01:47:30.472 --> 01:47:32.214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will be in touch.

01:47:33.255 --> 01:47:40.243
[SPEAKER_05]: This will probably be my last call-in, so thank you again for the show, and be well.

01:47:40.283 --> 01:47:40.704
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

01:47:40.844 --> 01:47:41.404
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

01:47:41.464 --> 01:47:42.165
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you once again.

01:47:42.185 --> 01:47:45.049
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we got into this last time, but thanks so much for all your support over the years.

01:47:45.089 --> 01:47:45.990
[SPEAKER_11]: It really does mean the world.

01:47:47.011 --> 01:47:48.553
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the thing.

01:47:48.573 --> 01:47:48.893
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:47:48.993 --> 01:47:49.654
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, YYR.

01:47:50.054 --> 01:47:50.555
[SPEAKER_11]: Until next time.

01:47:50.735 --> 01:47:51.296
[SPEAKER_11]: See you later.

01:47:51.496 --> 01:47:51.696
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:47:51.776 --> 01:47:52.778
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

01:47:52.798 --> 01:47:53.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

01:47:53.578 --> 01:47:54.019
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:47:54.039 --> 01:47:56.862
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get Rama in here.

01:47:56.902 --> 01:47:57.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

01:48:00.082 --> 01:48:01.546
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, hi, hi.

01:48:02.008 --> 01:48:03.031
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

01:48:06.261 --> 01:48:10.293
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I had two things I wanted to say, but now I have three things.

01:48:10.313 --> 01:48:11.758
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to thank YYR for that.

01:48:12.059 --> 01:48:12.400
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:48:13.323 --> 01:48:13.804
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

01:48:14.307 --> 01:48:24.007
[SPEAKER_09]: No, when you talk about the DDR tournaments, I can more or less vouch for that because as I mentioned before, I have also a friend named Matt.

01:48:24.087 --> 01:48:30.540
[SPEAKER_09]: I come to the realization almost every person I know named Matt has a DDR machine in their house, you know?

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.683
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

01:48:31.703 --> 01:48:31.843
Mm-hmm.

01:48:32.093 --> 01:48:46.570
[SPEAKER_09]: and I went over to his house you know he's having his party and him and his girl were talking about DDR in tournaments and I'm asking them what they're doing and they're like they have to submit their scores online to compete and I'm just like scratching my head that's a thing now?

01:48:47.311 --> 01:49:01.307
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go into details about it but when I'm hearing YYR talk about that I'm like yeah that make it's like the light switch went on you know yeah yeah and you said you had a friend that was at a tournament today

01:49:01.591 --> 01:49:02.333
[SPEAKER_09]: This weekend, yeah.

01:49:02.353 --> 01:49:05.581
[SPEAKER_09]: And he just had another one like a couple of weekends ago, too.

01:49:06.162 --> 01:49:10.933
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it makes you feel any better, it's within our age range.

01:49:11.154 --> 01:49:16.968
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's just say, oh, he can play.

01:49:16.988 --> 01:49:17.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:18.351
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:49:19.681 --> 01:49:23.226
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you mentioned Food Network earlier.

01:49:23.887 --> 01:49:44.897
[SPEAKER_09]: Then don't I. I'm on the bus coming home, and I just had to internally laugh because I'm at that age where we go to the conventions, we get into the room, after we've done our day thing or whatever, normally we would just hook up the fire stick, have some YouTube playing, chill drinks on the side.

01:49:45.558 --> 01:49:47.781
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we come into the room,

01:49:48.487 --> 01:49:55.680
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn on Food Network, and we just sit there and watch Diners, Drives, and Dies for the next three hours, okay?

01:49:57.143 --> 01:49:58.766
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

01:49:58.786 --> 01:50:00.128
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, good times.

01:50:00.569 --> 01:50:01.130
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.

01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:05.858
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I didn't mention this earlier in the show, but I went to a convention of sorts today.

01:50:05.939 --> 01:50:06.600
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little different.

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:09.685
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something called the Oddities and Curiosities Expo is here in town.

01:50:10.507 --> 01:50:12.250
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of that, yes.

01:50:12.230 --> 01:50:23.146
[SPEAKER_11]: So what it is, it's kind of like the vendor hall at an anime convention, but instead of it being anime waifu merchandise, it's like Baphomet, Elvira, and Kittens Summoning Demons.

01:50:23.346 --> 01:50:25.590
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's like all those sorts of... It's taxidermy.

01:50:26.091 --> 01:50:28.134
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's all sorts of like odd little things.

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:35.164
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course I ran into like multiple people I knew there just because of, you know, the circles I run in here locally.

01:50:35.184 --> 01:50:36.766
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was fun.

01:50:36.786 --> 01:50:38.008
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't end up buying anything though.

01:50:38.028 --> 01:50:39.250
[SPEAKER_11]: I was kind of... I just...

01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:41.132
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see anything that was like, oh, I got to have it.

01:50:41.153 --> 01:50:50.264
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an artist and I wish I'd gotten their business card because it was a really good Frankenfurter from Rocky Horror portrait with like snapping the pink glove.

01:50:50.645 --> 01:50:58.635
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looked like the way it was like the big eyes, like it looked like a Frankenstein from the 30s kind of poster that I really kind of liked.

01:50:59.016 --> 01:51:02.200
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wish I'd gotten that artist's info, but oh well.

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:03.381
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what you do?

01:51:03.641 --> 01:51:06.164
[SPEAKER_09]: See if they have a Facebook page or a group.

01:51:06.704 --> 01:51:08.146
[SPEAKER_09]: Join it and ask.

01:51:08.566 --> 01:51:09.347
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody will know.

01:51:09.767 --> 01:51:14.271
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that a few times where, oh, I missed this booth or this booth had this.

01:51:14.532 --> 01:51:15.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know who it was?

01:51:15.733 --> 01:51:16.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody has it.

01:51:16.594 --> 01:51:17.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Drew, you know what?

01:51:17.374 --> 01:51:25.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that you say that, I know that that account has an Instagram with stories and they post what people – and you'll see all these booths that are tagged.

01:51:25.042 --> 01:51:27.184
[SPEAKER_11]: So I should just see if the individual's booth was tagged.

01:51:27.384 --> 01:51:28.245
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually a really good idea.

01:51:28.865 --> 01:51:29.706
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

01:51:29.686 --> 01:51:32.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, what did you actually want to talk to us about tonight, Ranma?

01:51:33.115 --> 01:51:36.725
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to talk about the whole AI thing of Square Enix for a second.

01:51:37.166 --> 01:51:44.326
[SPEAKER_09]: And for this, I also want to thank you because of something you said about Blue Sky that came in handy last week.

01:51:44.346 --> 01:51:45.248
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm curious.

01:51:45.228 --> 01:51:47.230
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand AI.

01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:48.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'm in IT.

01:51:48.412 --> 01:51:49.613
[SPEAKER_09]: I see both sides of it.

01:51:49.733 --> 01:51:52.176
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it I'm for, some of it not so much.

01:51:52.737 --> 01:51:57.122
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand how AI can make your job better, can make your job worse.

01:51:57.342 --> 01:51:59.765
[SPEAKER_09]: It can make you lose your job.

01:51:59.785 --> 01:52:01.787
[SPEAKER_09]: I get all of it.

01:52:01.807 --> 01:52:09.215
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody on Blue Sky was talking about AI and how it's taking away all these jobs left and right for everything that's being done.

01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:14.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before I jump in and say something, I have to read and see what's going on.

01:52:14.607 --> 01:52:18.472
[SPEAKER_09]: and I've had to explain to people there are various types of AI out there.

01:52:18.712 --> 01:52:20.414
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, it's not even real AI.

01:52:20.514 --> 01:52:29.585
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what we call AI, I say it's a fancier version of Cortana or Siri, if you ask me personally.

01:52:29.605 --> 01:52:30.847
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're absolutely correct.

01:52:30.867 --> 01:52:33.730
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have anything that's yet passed the Turing test.

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:34.130
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

01:52:35.893 --> 01:52:42.601
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this topic of AI came up on this person's feed and we're starting to have a conversation about it.

01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:44.563
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told her,

01:52:44.662 --> 01:52:47.328
[SPEAKER_09]: Generative AI is the problem.

01:52:48.129 --> 01:52:48.911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem.

01:52:50.314 --> 01:52:54.102
[SPEAKER_09]: Narrow AI or assistive AI is the good thing.

01:52:54.122 --> 01:53:00.055
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm explaining to her how there are video games and software and application that has AI in it to help.

01:53:00.075 --> 01:53:02.620
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's part of, sometimes it's actually part of the code.

01:53:03.123 --> 01:53:32.050
[SPEAKER_11]: so instead of her complimenting me back oh she quote what I said and got on her soapbox about things I said nope remove quote mute nope I am not having that best best part of Blue Sky I realize Blue Sky is missing a lot but that is one thing that the old place did not have that is so handy is that when somebody tries to quote you to dunk on you not fuck that I'm sorry if you have to quote dunk me

01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:33.032
[SPEAKER_09]: You're weak.

01:53:33.052 --> 01:53:34.054
[SPEAKER_09]: Your family is weak.

01:53:34.214 --> 01:53:35.336
[SPEAKER_09]: Your lineage is weak.

01:53:35.917 --> 01:53:36.818
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on you.

01:53:37.139 --> 01:53:38.161
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on your cow.

01:53:38.421 --> 01:53:39.523
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on your family.

01:53:39.543 --> 01:53:40.926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:53:40.946 --> 01:53:45.654
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, AI and Square Enix and QA, in a way, I get it.

01:53:45.674 --> 01:53:50.983
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when you think about it, if the QA-ers are looking for like...

01:53:51.773 --> 01:53:52.694
[SPEAKER_09]: 100 things.

01:53:53.275 --> 01:53:57.080
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe 20 or 30 of those things are the same thing in different games.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:06.252
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see AI going in and automating that and then doing a quick check to see if that has been done, you know?

01:54:06.733 --> 01:54:08.715
[SPEAKER_09]: That part I do understand.

01:54:08.976 --> 01:54:12.921
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand like it's going to be 70%, you know?

01:54:12.901 --> 01:54:18.216
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, I get and I understand Square Enix's reasoning behind it.

01:54:18.797 --> 01:54:20.943
[SPEAKER_09]: Games will come out quicker and so forth.

01:54:21.324 --> 01:54:25.155
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the downside, some people will lose their jobs.

01:54:25.928 --> 01:54:31.835
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some cases, whoever is left, their jobs will be a little bit easier, less mind-numbing.

01:54:32.376 --> 01:54:32.757
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

01:54:32.777 --> 01:54:34.999
[SPEAKER_09]: They might even get a bump in pay.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:41.467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really up to the business culture to define is AI going to be a tool or is it going to be a replacement?

01:54:41.868 --> 01:54:51.480
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope that in a few years' time, you're going to see those companies where AI is a tool are going to outperform those where AI is a replacement.

01:54:52.355 --> 01:54:58.874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, because when I hear about it, and I'm reading about it, I'm like, I see it's more of a tool.

01:54:59.295 --> 01:55:07.157
[SPEAKER_09]: But the problem is, when you mention AI, 100% of the people that are against it

01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:11.354
[SPEAKER_09]: Guns blazing, shoot everybody.

01:55:11.374 --> 01:55:11.855
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

01:55:11.975 --> 01:55:13.016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more nuanced than that.

01:55:13.176 --> 01:55:14.638
[SPEAKER_11]: It is way more nuanced.

01:55:14.999 --> 01:55:20.166
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the label AI is being used too much.

01:55:20.506 --> 01:55:21.688
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the problem.

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:30.600
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's causing people to have that Pavlovian response to it when it's really, it's the generative AI that is the part that, you know, and how it's generating.

01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:36.027
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would even go so far as to say it's not all generative AI is bad depending on how it's being trained.

01:55:36.047 --> 01:55:37.810
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the key part.

01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.190
Yeah.

01:55:38.170 --> 01:55:52.095
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it's like those who kind of know the difference will be up in arms and then when someone in the tech, graphic, scientific field tries to simplify it

01:55:52.379 --> 01:55:54.422
[SPEAKER_09]: They look at you like, oh, you're pro AI.

01:55:54.442 --> 01:55:54.903
[SPEAKER_09]: But no.

01:55:55.524 --> 01:55:56.926
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to educate you.

01:55:56.986 --> 01:56:02.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Photoshop hasn't done a damn thing different in the last 20 years, except now they're calling it AI.

01:56:02.674 --> 01:56:06.099
[SPEAKER_11]: With an exception, actually, Adobe does have a generative picture thing.

01:56:07.181 --> 01:56:12.909
[SPEAKER_11]: From Adobe's standpoint, I happen to know that they are saying it's trained on their own stuff.

01:56:12.929 --> 01:56:14.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Adobe does not train on stuff outside.

01:56:14.752 --> 01:56:16.374
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't work for them or anything.

01:56:16.755 --> 01:56:18.497
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the loop of some of their updates.

01:56:18.517 --> 01:56:19.078
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,

01:56:19.058 --> 01:56:22.402
[SPEAKER_08]: don't they train on people that don't opt out of stuff?

01:56:24.265 --> 01:56:47.614
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you put it in creative cloud but if you sign out of it, they won't touch your stuff I'm not here to defend them, what I'm here to say is that for the most part, outside of those tools that actually do the generate me a picture of a bird kissing another bird, whatever you're into then that all the other tools are the same fucking things they've been doing for years except now they just call it AI

01:56:48.235 --> 01:56:51.720
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll say this one part and I get out here so you can do emails and all of that.

01:56:52.020 --> 01:57:06.741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gotten to the point where I forget the organization but there's like 16 different Japanese companies and organizations that are basically pushing back against it and passing legislation saying it's copyright infringement right off the bat.

01:57:07.342 --> 01:57:09.325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's been a lot of interesting development there.

01:57:10.266 --> 01:57:11.728
[SPEAKER_09]: The funny thing is

01:57:11.708 --> 01:57:19.639
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably would not have heard about this happening if Jareth AI didn't start doing graphics that looked like something that came out of a Ghibli movie.

01:57:20.721 --> 01:57:22.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Which that filter was all the rage.

01:57:22.563 --> 01:57:25.647
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyone, of course, with the trained eye would be able to tell that it's fake.

01:57:25.668 --> 01:57:32.457
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and all the most mediocre people you know on Facebook were running that filter on their pictures for a hot minute.

01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.062
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, let me say this.

01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:56.312
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

01:57:56.292 --> 01:58:15.094
[SPEAKER_09]: look for any anime AI image and find a picture of Gadget you will see resemblance you can get 20 different anime images that was AI rendered put a picture of Gadget right next to it and if you look at her face you will see the similarities across the board amazing

01:58:15.361 --> 01:58:20.248
[SPEAKER_01]: I have run across some that look very realistic, but I get your point.

01:58:21.009 --> 01:58:29.682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to say, though, that for anyone who is a trained artist, you're also going to find anatomical inconsistencies, shading, lighting.

01:58:30.523 --> 01:58:34.108
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find where a finger doesn't connect to the rest of the body.

01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:36.772
[SPEAKER_01]: There will always be an error.

01:58:37.433 --> 01:58:40.197
[SPEAKER_09]: The lines in the artwork may be clean, but wait, hold up.

01:58:40.217 --> 01:58:42.540
[SPEAKER_09]: Those lines are a little bit too clean.

01:58:42.781 --> 01:58:42.921
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

01:58:43.981 --> 01:58:51.034
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even necessary that I can do artwork, run it back through Pixelmator or what have you, and have my lines be super clean.

01:58:51.775 --> 01:58:55.662
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the issue that there'll be proportion issues.

01:58:55.682 --> 01:59:00.611
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a hand that doesn't quite go the right way, a leg that's turned in an unnatural way.

01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:04.538
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be something that tells that this is not real.

01:59:05.345 --> 01:59:09.470
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Ranma, this is a debate that's going to continue for a long time.

01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:11.352
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, Ranma, thank you so much for your call.

01:59:11.372 --> 01:59:12.774
[SPEAKER_11]: We always appreciate hearing from you.

01:59:13.034 --> 01:59:19.903
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the listeners want to hear more of you, which I hope they do, they'll tune in to you and your pals on Anime Jam Session.

01:59:20.003 --> 01:59:22.666
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, you still have a few shows before your holiday break.

01:59:22.686 --> 01:59:25.830
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, your holiday break's not for a few weeks.

01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:26.350
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

01:59:28.152 --> 01:59:31.617
[SPEAKER_01]: We did announce that it's you, me, and Brad, too, with our Endeavor.

01:59:32.818 --> 01:59:34.440
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally... When, tonight?

01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:42.120
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we did a week or so ago, but I think that... I actually don't think that was announced, but maybe you want to say something about that?

01:59:43.783 --> 01:59:44.143
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops!

01:59:44.163 --> 01:59:45.485
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Luke-chan!

01:59:46.206 --> 01:59:47.108
[SPEAKER_11]: Breaking news.

01:59:49.391 --> 01:59:50.753
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I said something, I'm sorry.

01:59:51.975 --> 01:59:55.380
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... Meow.

01:59:56.281 --> 01:59:58.865
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a cat running around, somebody's let it out of a bag.

01:59:59.887 --> 02:00:00.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Look over there!

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:05.472
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that means I have to go edit that project one more time.

02:00:08.195 --> 02:00:09.296
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

02:00:10.417 --> 02:00:10.978
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

02:00:11.098 --> 02:00:11.699
[SPEAKER_00]: We still love you.

02:00:11.759 --> 02:00:12.439
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.

02:00:13.561 --> 02:00:14.482
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very happy.

02:00:14.782 --> 02:00:18.506
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will leave it as that teaser until later.

02:00:18.526 --> 02:00:18.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:21.409
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, Ranma.

02:00:21.529 --> 02:00:22.270
[SPEAKER_11]: Always good to hear from you.

02:00:22.670 --> 02:00:24.933
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently we're going to hear a lot more from you.

02:00:27.075 --> 02:00:27.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, buddy.

02:00:29.011 --> 02:00:29.351
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:00:30.653 --> 02:00:31.834
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

02:00:31.914 --> 02:00:32.595
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to emails.

02:00:32.815 --> 02:00:35.659
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel kind of bad now, but I thought I had said something already.

02:00:35.679 --> 02:00:36.019
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:37.300
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

02:00:37.321 --> 02:00:38.222
[SPEAKER_11]: So you said it now.

02:00:38.442 --> 02:00:38.922
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

02:00:39.002 --> 02:00:39.443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

02:00:39.843 --> 02:00:40.164
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:00:41.525 --> 02:00:41.866
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:00:42.406 --> 02:00:42.807
[SPEAKER_11]: Emails.

02:00:44.128 --> 02:00:44.389
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:00:44.469 --> 02:00:45.290
[SPEAKER_01]: First email.

02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:47.452
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from DarkTetsuya.

02:00:48.513 --> 02:00:49.575
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of goodbye.

02:00:51.096 --> 02:00:56.823
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am angry at you right now, sir, because that song's been stuck in my head ever since I saw your email.

02:00:57.103 --> 02:00:58.765
[SPEAKER_11]: But what a good song to have stuck in your head.

02:00:58.812 --> 02:01:03.317
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good song, but still, I'd like... I mean, it did replace the final countdown, so there's that.

02:01:04.578 --> 02:01:05.119
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

02:01:06.681 --> 02:01:08.102
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, OLR?

02:01:08.122 --> 02:01:09.484
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't believe this is it.

02:01:09.504 --> 02:01:13.268
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 years of Sunday nights all coming to an end, of course, for me.

02:01:13.909 --> 02:01:15.991
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd known you all since sometime in 2000, 2001.

02:01:16.331 --> 02:01:24.941
[SPEAKER_01]: A chance encountered a local Bimani party when I discovered y'all were like-minded nerds as far as Konami's note-smashing stuff is concerned.

02:01:26.142 --> 02:01:26.743
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

02:01:27.297 --> 02:01:54.756
[SPEAKER_01]: but fast forward to that fateful summer in 2002 after launching the live 365 stream of Bimani Dance Mania and other sort of rhythm game music there was the debut of the Sunday Night Show and it was probably taboo to talk about numbers but back then as I recall we had all of 12 live listeners and of course I was one of the lucky ones also I agree Shane was right about the early episodes bringing that Bimani Party all night energy to the podcast what a hell of a time

02:01:54.736 --> 02:02:06.759
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering the Solo 2000 controversy with the supposedly risque background animations and that crowd overreacting the way they tend to do, plus the first break that we ever took to Vanessa May's Destiny.

02:02:06.899 --> 02:02:08.322
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a night I would never forget.

02:02:09.945 --> 02:02:18.060
[SPEAKER_01]: There was for a time also the website component, which I don't know if folks knew you used to take submissions.

02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:26.652
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I had the record for the most submissions, so imagine my surprise when I got the message, Hey, you want to help us backstage with stories and stuff?

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:29.575
[SPEAKER_01]: You've submitted so many, we thought we'd just let you do that on your own.

02:02:29.996 --> 02:02:35.784
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was invited backstage to help pitch in, which would continue to go through the rest of the run, speaking of which.

02:02:35.804 --> 02:02:47.980
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we eventually moved onto the podcast, first with the extra to-go episodes, and then about a year of that merged the two shows for the rest of its run.

02:02:49.158 --> 02:03:07.538
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:03:08.395 --> 02:03:16.106
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are the other side projects I helped with to accompany the show, such as the Wikia, which we did come too close to comfort for losing.

02:03:16.646 --> 02:03:23.456
[SPEAKER_01]: Eternal gratitude for Bobby Blackwolf with his help in getting it restored, and to keep a record of all our shows both past and present.

02:03:23.476 --> 02:03:26.600
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the OL Archive, the official archive for our oldest shows.

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Did y'all know 100...

02:03:29.152 --> 02:03:30.014
[SPEAKER_01]: I say 100.

02:03:30.055 --> 02:03:37.014
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all know one of our former fans, Jaded, hooked me up with the most original 1.0 run of Guys on a Show.

02:03:37.135 --> 02:03:39.702
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wanted to hear that, it's there for your listening pleasure.

02:03:40.542 --> 02:03:45.391
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I know a lot of us grew, changed, graduated, got married, had families, and so on.

02:03:45.711 --> 02:03:53.625
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I met my wife, a friend of a friend of one of the OGs, TSS Tech Angel.

02:03:53.765 --> 02:03:55.168
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say words.

02:03:55.188 --> 02:03:57.913
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is no small thing to say the show changed my life forever.

02:03:57.953 --> 02:04:00.998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the most amazing thing I've been a part of.

02:04:00.978 --> 02:04:14.076
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has been a part of my life for over two decades I always said to myself what would I even do on Sundays anymore after they're over it definitely won't be the same thank you all for changing my Sunday night forever

02:04:16.098 --> 02:04:18.602
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for that, Dr. Tutsuya.

02:04:18.742 --> 02:04:22.948
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this show has meant a lot to you, almost as much as it has to us over the years.

02:04:22.968 --> 02:04:26.913
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, everything you said in there about getting invited backstage, true.

02:04:27.254 --> 02:04:36.587
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there was actually, it was funny, there was a point, I know you were invited backstage before that, but we had to shut down the forums at VOG Network just because of spammers and

02:04:36.567 --> 02:04:40.916
[SPEAKER_11]: The forum software is just generally old technology, right?

02:04:40.936 --> 02:04:42.339
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it is open to vulnerabilities.

02:04:42.619 --> 02:04:43.962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm oversimplifying it.

02:04:43.982 --> 02:04:46.768
[SPEAKER_11]: So discords kind of became internet forums at some point.

02:04:46.848 --> 02:04:49.213
[SPEAKER_11]: One could argue there's still Reddit and things like that.

02:04:49.233 --> 02:04:54.103
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the most part, a lot of forum type chatter went over to something like a discord at some point.

02:04:54.083 --> 02:05:22.960
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:41.573
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:05:41.553 --> 02:05:45.699
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for the most part, I would say like 95% of people did get that change.

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:50.146
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wish other people would have realized we were always still talking about other games.

02:05:50.206 --> 02:05:54.853
[SPEAKER_11]: You go back in those shows and we're talking about like Dreamcast games playing to Jamie's and things like that.

02:05:54.873 --> 02:05:57.117
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, we were always talking about all games.

02:05:57.137 --> 02:06:00.963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, we kind of made that switch a little more official.

02:06:01.083 --> 02:06:04.448
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, quite the retrospective there.

02:06:04.829 --> 02:06:06.311
[SPEAKER_11]: Or should I say retrospective song?

02:06:06.611 --> 02:06:08.815
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to keep the Bomani song title names.

02:06:09.696 --> 02:06:10.277
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:13.906
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:06:13.926 --> 02:06:14.627
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one more email.

02:06:15.288 --> 02:06:15.748
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

02:06:17.530 --> 02:06:18.411
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, OLR.

02:06:18.512 --> 02:06:19.613
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your girl Mishi here.

02:06:19.733 --> 02:06:27.482
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to express my gratitude toward you all and the members of this show because without you guys, I never would have met my best friend and partner, Dark Tetsuya.

02:06:28.143 --> 02:06:30.486
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the memories and the wonderful show.

02:06:30.606 --> 02:06:35.752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll miss this on Sunday nights and I wish the OLR me the best in whatever you guys have planned for the future.

02:06:36.173 --> 02:06:36.974
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the memories.

02:06:37.134 --> 02:06:38.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night, y'all.

02:06:38.135 --> 02:06:39.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Sincerely, Mishi, a.k.a.

02:06:39.837 --> 02:06:40.618
[SPEAKER_01]: Mishikins.

02:06:41.881 --> 02:07:02.944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:07:02.924 --> 02:07:08.756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy for me to sit here and say, gross, barf, but it's really adorable.

02:07:09.497 --> 02:07:16.972
[SPEAKER_11]: And well, if I am going to say something sassy, Mish, you and D'Artistou make straight people tolerable.

02:07:16.992 --> 02:07:17.794
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say that.

02:07:19.529 --> 02:07:21.791
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and also, I do mean authentically.

02:07:21.811 --> 02:07:22.792
[SPEAKER_11]: You two are adorable.

02:07:23.373 --> 02:07:39.247
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this show had any small part in that, which is wild for me to think that this show set up relationships, but even when I think about my own marriage, this show was a way for Alan to get to know me when we lived 100 miles apart.

02:07:39.307 --> 02:07:44.292
[SPEAKER_11]: So I recognize this show has enhanced or sparked some relationships out there.

02:07:44.452 --> 02:07:48.996
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, it's wild to think about, but...

02:07:48.976 --> 02:07:52.580
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of us did get married during the course of the show.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:57.465
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Dan and I just celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary.

02:07:59.728 --> 02:08:09.719
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you and Alan and Matt and Nellie, and you've had small ones who are not so small anymore.

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:12.522
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have all had our collection of felines.

02:08:13.443 --> 02:08:13.583
Mm-hmm.

02:08:13.715 --> 02:08:19.561
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in Peace Shermie, and Maruko, and Mr. Smush, and Sanrio.

02:08:21.043 --> 02:08:23.666
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was your cat's name?

02:08:23.806 --> 02:08:25.948
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Stella.

02:08:26.769 --> 02:08:27.090
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:08:28.711 --> 02:08:30.313
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts to all of our pets.

02:08:31.575 --> 02:08:33.337
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

02:08:33.797 --> 02:08:38.322
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always wanted to...

02:08:40.462 --> 02:09:05.018
[SPEAKER_01]: I may play like a little bit aggro like as the you know the bitchy co-host type person but it's all you know I have nothing but but cinnamon roll level feelings for for everybody and um yeah yeah all right well cinnamon roll I want a cinnamon roll now um

02:09:06.128 --> 02:09:23.142
[SPEAKER_01]: um anyway Dan cinnamon rolls I think that's it for emails tonight right so that is it and um of course uh I'm gonna I'm gonna play polya because I have to play something light before bed

02:09:23.122 --> 02:09:29.940
[SPEAKER_11]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email, which remember, there's only a couple weeks left to do that.

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.664
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hope you will take advantage of that.

02:09:32.146 --> 02:09:39.966
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have, I always want to just say by default, I don't know why my brain, I almost caught myself saying the Skype line.

02:09:39.946 --> 02:09:41.849
[SPEAKER_11]: But we all know it's Discord.

02:09:42.089 --> 02:09:46.936
[SPEAKER_11]: Discord will be open all night on the final night.

02:09:47.336 --> 02:09:50.341
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have some other things we're going to do and play around and have a good time.

02:09:51.522 --> 02:09:54.566
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I know it's hard.

02:09:54.667 --> 02:09:59.013
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm torn because on one hand, I am apologetic.

02:09:59.073 --> 02:10:04.300
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry that I'm sort of the starter to...

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.823
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, hey, I want to tap the brakes on this.

02:10:06.843 --> 02:10:17.938
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the other hand, I also know that for myself and just my batteries and my just... I don't want to say my mental health, but in part it is that.

02:10:17.958 --> 02:10:29.432
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to make this decision that's very difficult to just allow myself to take some time to stop because I've been working nonstop every day for so long.

02:10:29.452 --> 02:10:33.898
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean that I love you all any less, all of you.

02:10:33.878 --> 02:10:41.286
[SPEAKER_11]: It just means I am recognizing that I just have to put myself first, which is hard to do sometimes.

02:10:41.306 --> 02:10:45.991
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sometimes takes... Especially when that decision affects other people.

02:10:46.632 --> 02:10:47.232
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

02:10:47.252 --> 02:10:48.073
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

02:10:48.373 --> 02:10:49.675
[SPEAKER_11]: And that makes it harder.

02:10:49.695 --> 02:10:50.015
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:10:50.596 --> 02:10:50.796
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

02:10:53.799 --> 02:10:54.039
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

02:10:55.041 --> 02:10:59.245
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm trying to look at...

02:10:59.748 --> 02:11:19.866
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:37.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stuff earlier, I'm really happy to hear who is also involved in that because like in particular, I think, well, number one, you have quite the Super Smash Brothers of VOG personalities over the years coming together, which I think is incredible.

02:11:37.284 --> 02:11:41.871
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really excited for Brad to have an outlet like that again as well, I think is also like...

02:11:41.851 --> 02:12:08.820
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:21.614
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I scream at everybody in my DBD matches, I've got great people in my life who help me with that too, like Shay and Shadow, who have been in my chats a lot, and Brad and Mike and everybody.

02:12:21.714 --> 02:12:35.088
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of OLR people supported me, and I really appreciate you being there with me for that venture and sticking with me even though I'm dating pigeons in games sometimes.

02:12:35.108 --> 02:12:36.790
[SPEAKER_01]: VOGtron, Matt.

02:12:37.711 --> 02:12:38.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

02:12:38.855 --> 02:12:46.169
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go make a bean quesadilla so that I can not sniff.

02:12:46.329 --> 02:12:46.950
[SPEAKER_01]: Quesadilla.

02:12:48.914 --> 02:12:51.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I ever tell you the story about the case of beer?

02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:52.521
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this.

02:12:52.561 --> 02:12:53.282
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last story.

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:58.412
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a restaurant in Mobile, Alabama called El Chico.

02:12:58.452 --> 02:12:59.254
[SPEAKER_01]: It was our favorite.

02:12:59.274 --> 02:13:02.179
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd all have family meetups and everything there.

02:13:02.159 --> 02:13:26.648
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were there with my uncle's wife and her parents at the time and my grandma was running late and so like hey should I order for Juliet and like yeah she wants a quesadilla well I didn't know Juliet drank she thought grandma said a case of beer so there you go a case of beer

02:13:26.982 --> 02:13:27.783
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, okay.

02:13:27.823 --> 02:13:29.865
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'll see, I like a quesadilla.

02:13:30.686 --> 02:13:37.874
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever, okay, but my new obsession in the late night Mexican food department, not just a quesadilla, but a quesaburria.

02:13:38.094 --> 02:13:39.136
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you had one of those?

02:13:39.836 --> 02:13:40.577
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this?

02:13:41.198 --> 02:13:41.739
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

02:13:41.879 --> 02:13:43.761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't know what they do to it.

02:13:43.901 --> 02:13:46.824
[SPEAKER_08]: They soak it in consomme.

02:13:46.844 --> 02:13:48.887
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they soak it and they fry it.

02:13:48.907 --> 02:13:51.990
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it gives it like just extra fat on that.

02:13:52.230 --> 02:13:52.651
[SPEAKER_11]: Gasp.

02:13:52.811 --> 02:13:54.333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good.

02:13:54.353 --> 02:13:55.774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good.

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:56.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Gasp.

02:13:57.053 --> 02:13:59.415
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I require Thursday.

02:14:01.037 --> 02:14:03.919
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where the fuck to get quesadillas in this town, but you know what?

02:14:03.959 --> 02:14:04.640
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll find something.

02:14:05.681 --> 02:14:06.142
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere.

02:14:06.162 --> 02:14:07.443
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a lot of places.

02:14:07.463 --> 02:14:14.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, any hole-in-the-wall Mexican place is going to have it, but it was LA where I had it for the first time, and I fell in love.

02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:16.391
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

02:14:16.571 --> 02:14:20.175
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll have to see if my stomach can handle it, but let's make this happen.

02:14:20.235 --> 02:14:23.398
[SPEAKER_11]: Victoria and I had DoorDash Mexican food at like 1 in the morning.

02:14:23.438 --> 02:14:24.078
[SPEAKER_11]: It was incredible.

02:14:24.699 --> 02:14:24.799
Okay.

02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:25.811
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.

02:14:25.952 --> 02:14:26.933
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:14:26.953 --> 02:14:27.314
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:14:27.394 --> 02:14:27.835
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:14:28.416 --> 02:14:37.594
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we got bedtimes to happen and, and Pally is to play and shows to edit and, and, and, and give me your money.

02:14:37.814 --> 02:14:38.035
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:14:38.055 --> 02:14:39.497
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, la, la, la, la, la, la.

02:14:39.517 --> 02:14:41.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Then before I get your final thought, DarkSakura, I'll let you go.

02:14:41.822 --> 02:14:44.627
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.

02:14:46.463 --> 02:14:47.365
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

02:14:47.625 --> 02:14:50.231
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we'll get to DarkSakura, your final thought.

02:14:50.271 --> 02:14:56.484
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I guess I should say, you know, I usually end this show with saying, you know, something like, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend, help us spread the word.

02:14:56.504 --> 02:14:57.707
[SPEAKER_11]: That is all still true.

02:14:58.147 --> 02:15:02.356
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, especially I would say, tell somebody who used to listen to us to come back, please.

02:15:02.456 --> 02:15:03.799
[SPEAKER_11]: You got two nights left to do it.

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.565
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we that podcast that someone used to know?

02:15:06.545 --> 02:15:09.310
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's kind of how it goes for a lot of people.

02:15:09.671 --> 02:15:18.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week, I did what I promised I would do, even though it broke every fiber of my being, and I logged into X, and I made a post.

02:15:18.967 --> 02:15:21.952
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was somebody who replied the equivalent of OMG.

02:15:22.433 --> 02:15:25.479
[SPEAKER_11]: So it got, you know, we're trying to let people know.

02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:29.806
[SPEAKER_01]: And PodCulture says, spay and neuter your pets, also your neighbors.

02:15:30.007 --> 02:15:30.207
Of course.

02:15:31.334 --> 02:15:33.197
[SPEAKER_11]: Your neighbor's pets or your neighbors?

02:15:33.257 --> 02:15:34.479
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I would say... Your neighbors.

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:35.480
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

02:15:36.021 --> 02:15:37.303
[SPEAKER_01]: And Petapossum.

02:15:37.744 --> 02:15:41.709
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, I will just say thank you for all of your support over the years.

02:15:41.729 --> 02:15:44.874
[SPEAKER_11]: As you all know by now, our last show is in two weeks.

02:15:44.894 --> 02:15:51.624
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's bittersweet, but we are so thankful to all of you that have kept this powered for 23 and a half years.

02:15:51.644 --> 02:15:56.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you think about all the shows in the history of the internet...

02:15:56.832 --> 02:16:04.329
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the shows in the history of the internet, there are very few, very few on any topic that have gone this long.

02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:06.354
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few on any topic that has gone this long.

02:16:06.835 --> 02:16:12.107
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the world of video games, there is one that has gone this long.

02:16:12.087 --> 02:16:16.492
[SPEAKER_11]: and another one in Spain that took an entire year off, but that's neither here nor there.

02:16:16.512 --> 02:16:20.175
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's one that's gone this long consistently and that's this one.

02:16:20.195 --> 02:16:30.466
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately it had to end someday, but you guys have made this a hell of a ride, a world record run, literally, here on this show.

02:16:30.506 --> 02:16:31.427
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for your support.

02:16:32.708 --> 02:16:34.831
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, DarkSakura, your final thought?

02:16:40.416 --> 02:16:40.997
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dollar.

02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.322
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what's your Venmo?

02:16:43.342 --> 02:16:44.784
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:16:45.165 --> 02:16:46.427
[SPEAKER_01]: And possums are awesome.

02:16:46.547 --> 02:16:50.793
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat ticks and other terrible things, and they are almost immune to rabies.

02:16:52.656 --> 02:16:53.818
[SPEAKER_01]: So, go pet a possum.

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:55.681
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, have a good stream, DarkSakura.

02:16:55.701 --> 02:16:56.022
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, don't.

02:16:56.042 --> 02:16:58.025
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just hiss at you.

02:16:58.045 --> 02:16:58.526
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good stream.

02:17:00.128 --> 02:17:02.151
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye!

02:17:02.231 --> 02:17:03.513
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, we're over to you.

02:17:03.553 --> 02:17:05.196
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your final thought for us tonight?

02:17:05.716 --> 02:17:16.182
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully I'll have my modded series ready to go soon because I've been working on that for a while now keep tweaking things I think we're almost to a point where I can do it

02:17:18.153 --> 02:17:23.203
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is I went to a drag brunch today.

02:17:23.343 --> 02:17:27.070
[SPEAKER_11]: So a friend of a friend was in from out of town and my friend wanted me to meet him.

02:17:27.090 --> 02:17:30.196
[SPEAKER_11]: So we all went to drag brunch together and that was a lot of fun.

02:17:30.256 --> 02:17:31.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Very high energy.

02:17:31.158 --> 02:17:32.621
[SPEAKER_11]: The drag performers did very well.

02:17:32.641 --> 02:17:34.805
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly have nothing negative to say in that department.

02:17:34.905 --> 02:17:41.157
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say sometimes you bachelorette party girls need to behave yourselves at those events, but...

02:17:41.137 --> 02:17:41.998
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fine.

02:17:42.018 --> 02:17:42.659
[SPEAKER_11]: The show was good.

02:17:42.699 --> 02:17:47.784
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I think that just all goes to say, support your local artists.

02:17:48.265 --> 02:17:52.029
[SPEAKER_11]: I say this a lot when I'm hosting shows live, and I probably need to say it more here.

02:17:52.569 --> 02:18:04.242
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I can literally have final words as I am, you know, sunsetting this whole thing, support your local artists, drag performers, burlesque performers, dancers.

02:18:04.222 --> 02:18:10.849
[SPEAKER_11]: Local artists showing in art galleries, choirs and vocal groups, pole dance troupes, you name it.

02:18:10.869 --> 02:18:12.591
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all sorts of art out there.

02:18:12.671 --> 02:18:15.935
[SPEAKER_11]: There is something for you and there's somebody locally producing it.

02:18:15.975 --> 02:18:18.277
[SPEAKER_11]: So please support your local artists.

02:18:19.258 --> 02:18:21.701
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that, we're going to roll credits.

02:18:22.562 --> 02:18:25.045
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next week for episode number 1069.

02:18:25.185 --> 02:18:26.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
