10105	13671	Why bother when we already have a battle net balance?
13691	21423	It's important to note that when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties.
21443	26190	This can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items.
26170	30861	Translation, we don't want credit card companies to prevent you from giving us money you don't have and can't afford.
31002	35713	Companies are in the business of protecting their ability to continue receiving income no matter the reason.
36315	41627	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
41647	43993	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.
45644	48647	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
48687	53012	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
53032	64885	It is Orange Lounge Radio live coming at you once again tonight, November the 9th, 2025, episode number 1068 of our program.
65706	73575	Over the last 23 and a half years, we've been joining you here every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and sometimes food.
73555	77584	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my partners in Internet Crime.
77684	79689	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
80591	80872	Hi.
81132	81774	Hello, hello.
81834	82235	How are you?
84360	85282	I'm a thing.
85302	86464	A thing.
86605	87467	I'm a thing.
87487	88008	I'm a way.
88208	89070	I'm a certain way.
89792	92458	I like the way your VTubers dress tonight.
93383	94184	Oh, thank you.
94485	98891	I was playing around with some of my Dead by Daylight textures that I have.
99231	99972	Gotcha.
99992	101875	How are we feeling about 2v8's return?
102035	106702	I guess I don't want to get too much into your gaming week, but... I'll talk about it in my gaming week.
107363	107964	All right, fair enough.
108344	111028	Let's go and say hello to Techmaster Loki.
113311	113471	Hey.
113712	114152	Hi, Loki.
114192	114733	How are you?
115642	135372	Yeah, I didn't have...
135352	140358	No, no, it's CaptainSparklez, he's a big YouTuber.
140418	147687	No, this is, the game I just won the show in the back there is, it's a thing running in Minecraft, so it's called SoulSteal.
147928	154776	It's a, it's like Sands of Time, it's made by the Nox crew folks who do MCC and stuff.
155277	157680	So they spun off, this is like a bedrock game.
158352	172845	I guess I always forget that there are the ability to do games within a game or whatever in Minecraft, which is silly of me to forget because I've played them.
173205	183995	I know they had a special limited edition Sonic thing I remember playing for a hot minute, and I'm sure there's all sorts of community-built ones, probably just like ZZT or Fortnite.
184035	185797	There's just a million of them out there.
186157	188359	You have the time to sample them.
188339	205791	Yeah, so I got, the other day they sent me, I had like 10 keys to it or something, I don't know what those are supposed to be for, something to unlock stuff, I guess, and then also I get a creator tag because I've been in MCC, so that'll be fun.
205940	206821	All right, good times.
208304	210747	So we'll get into our gaming weeks here in just a moment.
210768	214894	But as usual, we'll start off at the top of the show here with our kickoff topic.
214954	218800	So, Loki, lots of drama going around.
220342	222506	This is a game you're anticipating very much.
223287	227494	I'm not anticipating it this much at this point because who knows when it's going to come out.
227614	229296	And it's been like that for years now.
229477	231660	Brace yourself for mediocrity.
231978	233680	Yeah, well, it's not going to be mediocre.
233740	235302	No, it'll be a good game.
235362	235683	It will.
236043	245435	I don't trust any sort of date announcement for this game until it's actually out because it's just, it's moved so many times now that it doesn't matter.
245495	247217	So, yes, that's what happened.
247258	260955	Rockstar Games let everybody know after the last time where they said, it's not moving again, it's not moving again, that, yes, the date has moved again and now has been pushed out even further now about a whole year away.
261492	262614	Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto 6.
263174	269083	Because they need extra months to polish and finish the game to the level that we expected.
269123	273729	So it's going to be damn perfect when it comes out.
273749	274170	Hopefully.
274530	281079	Polish off all of those monetization systems that they're going to build into a multiplayer universe.
281159	286587	I don't think they need to really even worry about that because they've already nailed that down.
286607	288850	But yeah, I think it's going to be
289403	294229	Pretty amazing whenever it comes out, you know, at some point.
294609	297693	Actually, just real quick, if I can get some comments from chat.
297713	302699	SSJ100Matt says, they're pushing it back more and more to a future where 90 games are a commonplace.
303079	308846	You know, you say that, but I did think about a little bit of interesting irony.
308866	310749	I think none of this relates to each other.
310849	312551	It's just interesting irony.
312571	313572	But, you know, we've
313552	334834	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
334814	355708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
355688	361316	It's potential that a PlayStation 5 could be more expensive than it would be in November.
361837	366343	It is possible that the price of a PlayStation 5 comes down by the end of November.
366764	368106	So to be... I don't know.
368206	381185	It's an interesting sort of side effect, especially for people that maybe have been holding out on a PlayStation 5 this entire time until a new Grand Theft Auto game comes out, which I'm sure is more than non-zero.
381405	382627	It's a fair amount of people.
382647	383468	I don't think...
383448	387080	Yeah, I don't honestly see them... Here's my thought here.
387682	391895	I don't really think that they're going to raise the price of that game.
391915	394122	I know that they spent a lot of time on it.
394383	395045	But here's why.
395106	395888	Because...
396509	400675	They're going to be whoring that microtransaction stuff in the back end.
400735	414092	So to put an extra $10 wall there between the consumer and somebody that's able to purchase those microtransactions, it doesn't make sense because, one, they're going to get that negative stigma.
414112	415294	They're like, oh...
415274	416736	Look, now it's going up to $90.
416776	417077	I'll wait.
417457	419200	Well, it's going to be $70.
419220	420642	It's going to be $70.
420682	422004	Like, that's a given.
422024	422204	Oh, yeah.
422224	422905	It'll probably be $80.
423046	424348	It'll be $80 for sure.
424468	425089	Oh, yeah.
425549	426130	That's right.
426290	428113	I can't even remember how much games are anywhere.
428133	428394	Yeah, $80.
428414	429135	Thanks, Nintendo.
429335	430557	Thanks, Nintendo, for that.
430657	431378	Appreciate it.
431618	432780	You're so kind.
434062	437808	But I don't think that they're going to be the ones that push it more.
437948	440051	Like, certainly they could probably try to do that.
440071	443937	But I think it's a safer bet to just not do that.
444177	444758	Lose out.
445953	462223	DarkSakura,
462203	478120	GTA can charge it too some comments in chat about the delay SSJ100Matt says a wise man once said nobody will remember if you fart in public everyone remembers when you shit your pants I think that's exactly how Miyamoto phrased it actually looking back exactly
478100	480343	Nobody will remember the delays if the game is good.
480383	484689	And Bobby points out nobody remembers or cares how many times GTA V was delayed.
485089	487933	And at the end of the day, there's no complaint.
488354	488935	Don't get me wrong.
488995	490176	I'm not complaining about the delay.
490357	491358	Take the time to get it right.
491438	492559	Make sure it's bug-free.
492940	497606	I'm sure the game is vast and there's going to be lots of things they have to look at.
498187	501772	But it does lead to the, hmm, what's that pricing?
501812	503274	What's that economic?
503314	506719	That's more money now that they're fronting for the game.
507199	507820	But
507800	513768	I do think, I mean, they've made what, a billion dollars off of Grand Theft Auto 5 Online?
514369	518895	Oh, I think they make a billion dollars every year at least on that.
519616	522319	It's an enormous amount of money.
522339	526665	They're gonna make their dev money back, and then some, so don't cry for Rockstar.
527907	530230	But that doesn't stop them from acting...
531155	532576	A certain kind of way, doesn't Loki?
533497	550994	So, so there's a few, it's a kind of a, he said, she said type thing, or in the sense that you have a corporation saying, Hey, we, uh, we fired, you know, these 30 some employees because of Grossmink's conduct.
551094	557280	They were, um, they were essentially sharing leaks.
558931	578239	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
578641	585172	Certainly wouldn't be because of that, because according to the folks that are getting fired, they said that is the reason.
585513	593046	So, hypothetically, that public forum that you speak of is Discord, which actually I don't think is a hypothetical at all.
593086	594649	I believe it was called that it was Discord.
594669	598175	I haven't even seen any leaks yet of the game since the last time it was leaked.
598235	598776	Because it's...
598756	600039	It's not the game, Loki.
600059	614470	Here's what it is.
614450	635479	And what if that information, Loki, if we talk about this union and stuff, has nothing to do with the game at all?
635459	639203	It is what the working conditions are like for them to make this game.
639303	651595	Or potentially, maybe it's, you know, Hubbaloo about the game getting delayed or the game is going to be delayed and maybe some of the specifics on a very business scale as to why.
651975	656139	But not necessarily, you know, graphics, story, plot, play.
656439	657180	It's none of that.
657781	662445	It's hypothetically all the shit behind the scenes.
662425	670095	That lead to, you know, in some type of maybe union growing discord thing, because that's the place where a lot of people collaborate.
670395	673119	If it was 20 years ago, it would have been Slack.
673139	674621	You know, it's the same.
674821	680688	A lot of companies I know are still on Slack, but off the clock, not as many people on that.
680708	681970	So it's...
682304	688093	I think when we talk about leaks, I don't think we're talking about character art and level design.
688673	695003	I think we're talking about the project plan for release and how many hours that's causing us to work.
695644	696845	I think it's that.
697266	699970	It's things that gaming blogs don't care about.
700891	701612	That's what it is.
701753	710465	Yeah, they were in the Discord with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is the Discord apparently.
710726	710826	Yeah.
711228	713090	So then that's it.
713110	715553	So they're talking about union-related things.
715573	720478	And so I can see where people are jumping in and saying this is a form of union busting.
720879	731691	It gets weird, though, because there's that perspective of technically a private Discord server still lives on a public cloud.
732472	739159	And I'm not taking Rockstar's side here, but that's where on paper they're able to do it.
743307	752170	DarkSakura,
753803	778832	I don't know well and the optics are pretty shitty too right we're gonna fire all these people number one because they're trying to form a union number two right before the game is set to release and we're in that final polish I know it's weird to say that about a game that's a year out but they still they have a long polish and phase so it almost makes it seem like thanks for your long contributions to this game you're no longer needed and now we have this reason to sack you here's what they'll do they'll
778812	789987	all they'll do is they'll just wait until the game awards which is literally in a month or so and then they'll just drop another trailer and they'll be like oh nobody will talk about this yeah yeah yeah
791671	793233	Yeah, unfortunately.
793253	801841	Yeah, you would... It's interesting you bring up the Game Awards because I feel like there was a lot of pressure last year for Jeff to kind of comment on the industry.
802342	811111	And I wonder, you know, and I guess this is a silly thing to say, but, you know, I wonder if maybe there will be something said this year, but I also think we already know the answer.
811631	814915	He sort of mentioned something like, what is that, Summer Games Fest?
814935	816396	It was like barely...
816376	820142	Like, basically saying, like, hey, look at what these indie studios are doing.
820582	822245	Look at all this amazing stuff.
822665	824608	Yeah, I was more trying to hype the positive.
824749	825930	Well, because that's what it is.
825950	831479	You don't want to get up there on a night that you're trying to celebrate video games and say, wow, this industry is kind of going down the shitter.
832140	839170	Instead of taking the negative side, you're taking the positive side by uplifting and saying, these indie games are great.
839210	842255	And this is... And by the way, this is why Claire Obscure is going to sweep.
842655	843717	I...
843697	857241	I think there is... It's not just the fact that that game is rock solid, but I think a lot of the ways that game was made, even though, yes, I realize there were certain outsourced teams involved and so forth.
857281	860687	That's a lot of games that you hear about now.
860707	865215	At least it wasn't AI that are made.
865636	866397	So...
866917	869585	It's kind of sad we have to say that.
869645	872453	Well, wait till a later story.
872794	877146	Just file that on a little index card in the back of your head because we're going to pull that later in the show.
879185	881287	Anyway, let's see.
881467	885392	Over at our Twitch chat, over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
886873	890217	So Bobby is pointing out some of the behind-the-scenes stuff about the union.
890597	895022	They were just about able to get to 10% membership to be able to collect a bargain.
895362	901269	They are now not close to the 10% membership anymore, and others are scared to join to get to that 10%.
901609	909057	That all plays into that optics that really, like, it makes this whole you leaked confidential information a real stretch.
909037	914845	I wonder if, you know, again, this is UK law from what it sounds like, not US law.
914865	917629	So I'm not going to, I mean, I barely know shit when it comes to US law.
917669	919691	I'm not going to profess to know what's going on in the UK.
920172	931627	I just wonder if anyone takes this to a legal place to see what ends up, you know, if it is arbitrated or whatever, whether Discord, a private Discord is indeed a public forum.
932248	937656	That would be an interesting, because that's the whole technicality this whole thing is resting on.
937676	938757	It'd be interesting.
938737	944273	SJ100Matt says, firing team leaders and managers throws everything out of whack as well.
944293	947282	Nobody knows who they're reporting to and yeah, gonna delay stuff.
947302	949067	Just ask the federal government.
949334	976219	I added that last part let's see, Def says it's going to be hilarious to hear Jeff talk about the industry and how the workforce makes it happen and then give GTA a platform that's why I preface what I said this is probably a stupid thing to say but when's that stopped me before Bobby Blackwolf says this game was made by one guy with nine friends no bitch, that's ten people look
976992	980316	Jeff Keighley is a pretty face, not a mathematician.
981177	984060	Let's allow him to stay in his lane, okay?
985401	988284	He's an adorable little Canadian man that's done a lot in games.
988344	989205	He just wants to host a show.
989306	989686	That's right.
989706	990827	Just let him host a show.
990847	999577	Adorable little Canadian boy wearing dad's sport coat hosting a giant game trailer exhibition on a big stage.
999877	1002460	We don't see Brian Seacrest do math.
1002693	1004455	He shouldn't have to do math either.
1004475	1007420	Jeff Keighley is kind of the Ryan Seacrest of the games industry, though.
1007500	1008882	Just just marrying it.
1008902	1011345	That was a that was a very Linda Richmond type of moment.
1012126	1012827	I'm the Clint.
1013208	1013969	Here's a topic.
1015471	1016112	Jeff Keighley.
1018615	1021319	The Seacrest of the maybe Jeff Keighley hosts Wheel of Fortune next.
1021339	1021640	Let's see.
1022521	1025865	Mish says my favorite games this year have been Dinkum.
1025886	1026346	Dinkum.
1026386	1027688	I hardly knew him.
1027921	1034539	Ghosts of Yotai and Tales of Shilya
1035076	1037680	I'm not sure what my favorite is.
1037700	1038702	I haven't played them all yet.
1039002	1039523	Give me a minute.
1039563	1040685	Give me a minute.
1040905	1044130	Because we still have Metroid Prime 4 is still going to come out.
1044711	1051942	So we're going to have to do a follow-up at some point because as we all know, it's riding off into the sunset at the end of the month.
1052002	1054866	But I will be curious if Metroid Prime 4 lives up to the hype.
1055007	1057250	I hope as a Metroid Prime fan it does.
1057270	1058572	But we'll see.
1058592	1063800	So I feel like there's still some room for talk on what the best game of the year is.
1064438	1092910	although we should be getting Game Award nominees that'll probably be the headline our last episode because that's right about the week the week before Thanksgiving is when we get the nominees right because or is that that's right around the time the nominee the games have to come out but a lot of I think we know the journalists get advanced copies of those games so the eligibility window is like Black Friday but I think the nominees come out that week the week before Thanksgiving so um
1092890	1102723	Let's see, NSJ100Matt says, settling with those employees via lawsuit is cheaper than dealing with the union and GASP pay people well and fairly.
1102743	1103003	Ouch!
1103744	1107029	Truth detected.
1107049	1108090	Anything else on that, Loki?
1110033	1112316	Uh, no.
1112336	1113437	Nothing more on that.
1113457	1114138	Nothing more on that.
1115080	1142472	I want to go to the Game Awards, oddly I don't think I'll be able to There's a lot of things going on at work and that's right in the middle of the week I'd have to take like two days in the middle of the week to like because I can't trust that I'd be able to fly down there so I'd have to drive down there I've been hearing so many horror stories It would be nice to go once, though I want to go to the Game Awards just to say I went so, I don't know We'll see
1144139	1156596	DarkSakura
1156778	1161664	I did play 2v8 for Dead by Daylight.
1162385	1177926	Actually, yesterday, just on my first match, I just was solo queuing it, just because, and met some really fun people who were group streaming and playing together, and they invited me in, and we had a really good time, and I now have new friends.
1177906	1192928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1195118	1219067	P100 Pig
1219773	1236499	DarkSakura,
1236479	1241624	Also, I did not play any Avatar this week.
1241644	1242625	I kind of didn't feel like it.
1242645	1243406	I played Palia.
1244627	1245568	I beat Portal 2.
1245948	1261644	I know I've mentioned the crap going on with my hand, but it is hard to do fine control when a good quarter of your hand hurts from the bone, it feels like.
1261664	1264647	I mean, it's really the tendon, but it feels like it's coming from the bones.
1264627	1293958	so I've had a hard time playing but I did manage to beat the game and I love that game but now I have to think of something different to play next week what else oh yeah I have to thank Ryan who Shay's a Scotsman for gifting me Repo I am going to be starting that before too long oh cute yeah so
1294192	1298899	I just need to think of a different retro game for next Saturday now.
1299079	1302704	And that means using my brain and thinking and none of those things work.
1304426	1306649	I wish I had good suggestions for you.
1307731	1309033	I'm sure I'll have some retro stuff.
1310354	1312658	I'll just have to go hunting.
1312718	1313459	Well, we'll go to Loki.
1313479	1314360	How was your gaming week?
1315268	1342423	it's mostly been just trying to a lot of stuff actually I've been doing a lot of administrative stuff with the Minecraft server that I'm on so moving stuff around migrating our server to a different host server candidate stuff modeling a trophy for my Halloween decorating contest that I did um
1343163	1365373	yeah just playing Minecraft stuff and I did play a little bit more of the Once Upon a Katamari I'm having trouble having that game hold my interest though which is unfortunate because I really wanted it to be good it's just they put too many blockers in the way to make it fun I guess but I don't know we'll try it some more I'll figure something out
1366771	1367052	All right.
1368354	1373345	For my gaming week, I've been continuing with Dragon Quest 1 HD a little bit.
1373425	1379598	Did not play much more of the Mortal Kombat theme because the game that's been sucking all my time, surprise, surprise, Diablo 4.
1379978	1381041	But there's a reason for it.
1381441	1386552	I'm kind of doing the equivalent of like Dark Sakura P100-ing characters in Dead by Daylight.
1386532	1390857	I'm kind of going like as far as you can literally go in Diablo 4 with the current season.
1390877	1396103	I am like one or two quests away from completely finishing all of the season's quests.
1396123	1399207	That's far beyond the Battle Pass stuff that I'm already done with.
1399307	1403011	It's finishing like the most difficult challenges in the quest and unlocking like every reward.
1403131	1405734	I have never done that in any of the ten seasons.
1405794	1409198	I've always finished the Battle Pass, but never gone all the way to do the ultimate challenges.
1409178	1425567	This build that I'm doing right now, the Hydra Wizard, is so good that I am... Because there's some new items that make the Hydra Wizard super powerful, and I am two quests away from literally unlocking everything you can possibly unlock, including the most ultimate stuff this season.
1425547	1447977	Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 4
1447957	1457507	I think the fact that they do this limited XP and gold boost somewhat predictably is actually kind of ruining the game in a way.
1457907	1461090	Because for me now, I only want to play when that buff is active.
1461411	1462452	Why would I play otherwise?
1462972	1466376	Why wouldn't I play unless I'm getting the maximum amount of XP?
1466876	1475365	So Blizzard needs to, I think, rethink the way they're doing this Mother's Embrace boost because either they just need to do it all the time
1475345	1505318	which I know might sound wild but you know they've got another expansion coming they're gonna raise the Paragon level cap they're gonna be able to rethink you know how the XP distribution is or they need to just stop doing it all together except for like like one day Halloween and like other things that you know you would expect maybe the actual anniversary day things like that like otherwise they need to stop doing it this way because it's just as much as I love this game it just makes me go I'm only gonna play when that buff is up because that's when I'm gonna be able to maximize my time
1505298	1505960	Period.
1506850	1514519	But if you enjoy actually playing the game, why can't you play at any time and when the boost is up and just playing for fun?
1514539	1516061	I do, and that's true.
1516161	1522789	And especially from a multiplayer perspective, like if some of the other people I know, like Grandpa Warcraft actually plays Diablo 4.
1523150	1528476	And if he wanted me to be like, hey, jump on and help me grind this boss loot, I'd do it, whether the buff's up or not.
1528897	1536486	But I just kind of go, the accomplishment I want to get is all the shinies, and the best way for me to do the shinies is during the event.
1536466	1552197	but it's not to say I would never would I ever play the game the other times but I kind of go those are my times to play everything else that's on my backlog that's kind of why Diablo is more front of mind this week and maybe some of the other games took a backseat
1552700	1554123	All right.
1554163	1555625	But that's pretty much it for my game week.
1555705	1564100	Although I may have something to show here in a minute because Alan was just at Costco and I just heard or I got the notification he just got home with the garage door.
1564481	1568748	So I know he bought me something as he sent me a picture and I was like, oh, I want that.
1568769	1573577	So I'll show you all in a minute here as soon as I see it.
1573557	1576241	Oh, I did have one more thing I was going to mention.
1577482	1593484	So it was brought to my attention, thank you, DarkTetsuya, that Taki Udon, the guy that's behind the Super Station, it's like a FPGA emulation box that looks like a PlayStation 1.
1594705	1597749	So they were looking for homebrew games to put on it.
1597770	1601134	So I submitted Pixel Hoops number two, and it's going to be on it.
1601587	1612543	Whatever he releases the hardware Holy shit, good for you, that's great Yeah, it'll be cool Is the hardware something on Amazon, or where will I get the hardware?
1613204	1626463	It is on Taki Udon's site, so it's retroremake.co Love that It's the Superstation 1
1627051	1635804	All right, and Alan just brought me what he bought me at Costco, and it's another little mini arcade, although this one seems a little bit more durable.
1635824	1638908	It is a Sonic the Hedgehog My Arcade.
1639009	1639229	I saw that.
1639249	1640150	It was just there yesterday.
1640170	1641372	This one's pretty durable, though.
1641733	1645118	Unlike the other My Arcades, it has a more – that's why this is $10 more probably.
1645138	1650305	It has a more solid front to it to keep this weighted down so you can actually play it a lot better.
1650325	1653270	And that stick that's in there – let me get it better in frame.
1653290	1655573	For those on the podcast feed –
1655553	1662364	It's like a mini arcade machine, meaning the type that sits on yourself, or shelf, or on yourself.
1662605	1663386	It's got a big stick on it.
1663406	1670478	It's got a big old stick that actually looks a little bit more like what you would see in an arcade, maybe of a baby style, and then some buttons on it.
1670498	1673643	And it says it has Sonic 1 and 2 are built into that.
1673964	1675967	Yeah, I bought Sonic the Hedgehog again.
1676027	1676308	Woo!
1676368	1678030	But I actually, this is pretty cool.
1678391	1680835	I wonder how many batteries this thing takes.
1680815	1683460	I would assume it's still just a few double A's.
1683960	1688929	Just because the base is weighty and has that big control doesn't mean it's going to take more battery power.
1689430	1690532	So that's kind of neat.
1690552	1692555	So anyway, that's my little special thing.
1692575	1693457	I get to set up later.
1695200	1695460	Fun.
1695781	1697163	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
1697724	1698165	Loki.
1699310	1704336	Halo Infinite, it's just about done getting updates.
1704356	1715408	So this next major update, Operation Infinite, will be the last update that it receives, which has been confirmed by Halo Studios in a brand new blog post.
1716089	1720474	And then, of course, they have all their other projects that they're going to be working on.
1720514	1724018	They've teased multiple games in the pipeline.
1723998	1743289	and says as we look ahead your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals in hopes of succeeding expectations and delivering the best Halo experiences possible and the game of course is not being shut down it's just not being developed any further so you know make that kind of clear
1743809	1771673	but yeah of course we know that Halo Campaign Evolved is coming as well and then there's also going to be some other games as well they're going to be shifting their their dev teams too so neat that's still being I completely forgot about Halo Infinite since you know I know when it initially launched it was rough but it's cool I guess it's been supported this long but
1772092	1774415	Well, it was supposed to be a 10-year game, Loki.
1774515	1776858	Halo Infinite, meaning forever.
1777278	1779461	Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, forever.
1779481	1785629	Well, you know, I guess four years is the new 10 years.
1786230	1791797	I mean, if you think about it, like, you know... Can we apply that to Term Limits?
1792638	1794099	Can we apply that to Term Limits?
1794120	1796142	Yeah.
1796847	1801921	We've all aged 10 years in this last four years, so it only makes sense that the game is done.
1802364	1802605	Exactly.
1803412	1804393	Hmm.
1804413	1804873	All right.
1805074	1812500	Well, I would say sorry to the Halo fans, but we just had that news last week about the Halo, you know, reboot or whatever on PS5.
1812601	1813101	Exactly.
1813141	1814382	They're working on more Halo 4.
1814402	1814903	Exactly.
1814963	1816084	You can calm down.
1816684	1828796	This is a, and that is going to be definitely a palette reset to, you know, see how this Halo thing kind of lands when everybody can play this no matter what they're playing on.
1828816	1830037	Except for Nintendo, I guess.
1831338	1831478	Mm-hmm.
1831880	1860807	but it'll be very interesting to see how that sort of maybe resets how many people are active in Halo multiplayer lobbies except now that I'm saying that out loud I think a big sticking point of Halo the new one is that there is no multiplayer it's really only the campaign I'm thinking like the Don Mattrick quote you know where they're talking about like you know if you can't afford the Xbox One the Xbox 360 is for you it's like if you can't play Halo you know remastered or whatever it is Splatoon 3 is for you
1862761	1888330	Oh lord I had more fun with Splatoon 3 than recent Halo games That is a gross comparison You got Metroid Prime 4 I was going to say, it is, because Splatoon 3 is really fun Halo is out after a while I'd rather play Splatoon anyway
1890267	1892110	Oh god, what was the crappy game?
1892190	1895655	It was a Metroid spin-off, but it was like something Force.
1895675	1896537	It was just awful.
1897018	1901084	Like a PvP Metroid game, but didn't even call itself Metroid.
1901104	1903047	Oh, the Strike Force thing on the DS?
1904048	1905431	Yeah, yeah, something like that.
1905451	1906532	Strike Team Force or whatever it was?
1906572	1908295	Yeah, I know, I remember which Strike Force.
1908555	1910358	Oh, Federation Force.
1910398	1912782	Numerous chatters popping in with that, yeah.
1914719	1915159	All right.
1916380	1927390	Okay, so I'm going to ask DarkSakura to get ready to pull that index card I had her set in her brain earlier in the show because we're going to talk about, unfortunately, Square Enix is making some layoffs.
1928371	1934757	Not a total surprise because I believe we had a headline a few weeks ago that was talking about this possibility that was going to happen.
1935257	1944726	So of course, Square Enix, and you know them through Final Fantasy, but I think it's important for this story to really understand they make a lot more than just Final Fantasy.
1944706	1952816	Um, for example, didn't Square Enix make, speaking of Splatoon-y games, didn't Square Enix make that game, oh god, Shane made me play it.
1953076	1953897	Thank you, Foam Stars.
1953918	1955079	That was a Square Enix game, right?
1956120	1967234	So, they make a lot of games that you don't usually associate with the JRPG brand, which is exactly what you're gonna realize the rest of the story is.
1968035	1968756	Um...
1968736	1980888	So they've decided that they're going to be laying off an undisclosed amount of employees, specifically North America and European publishing operations, as it looks to streamline all of that.
1980908	1986374	They already said in a presentation to investors that this was going to happen.
1986454	1997325	"...in the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency."
1997305	2002995	They're looking to save about 19.6 million, that's 3 billion yen, from this restructuring.
2003015	2009386	They're going to consolidate the HD Games publishing organization from 11 divisions down to 4.
2009887	2011951	I had no idea they had 11 divisions.
2012352	2015497	I'd be very curious what that means for the games themselves.
2015517	2020967	But anyway, they are not disclosing how many employees that totals.
2020947	2038585	and DarkSakura.
2038565	2044310	There's a lot of mystique in what they're saying there with all that.
2044390	2052758	But I mean, granted, it sounds like they're going to take publishing a little more worldwide, which I mean, in some ways we do live in a worldwide market.
2052778	2061386	And I would anticipate that probably some things you see that are a little more outside the Japanese focus games are probably going to get hit a little bit.
2061806	2066210	DJ Ranma S says, where's my Rad Racer 3 Square Enix?
2066470	2066650	True.
2066991	2068572	Where's...
2068552	2086341	where's our Chrono Trigger remake in the Octopath engine that has served them so well for like Live Alive and Dragon Quest and all these fucking other games so anyway YYR does point out granted Square used to make a lot of really great non-RPG games
2086321	2087402	Such as Rad Racer, right?
2087723	2090826	Remember when they were firing on all cylinders on PS1?
2091106	2095151	Bushido Blade, Einhander, Tabal, Urgeis, and others.
2095171	2095772	Great point.
2096052	2098755	That's probably when we came up with 11 publishing arms.
2099075	2102319	D'Artizia says, there's a new one, blanking on the name.
2102339	2105463	Mike Def says, where's Theatrhythm final bar for PC?
2105743	2107164	That's a great fucking question.
2107545	2110428	Because Theatrhythm, I hope we still get more Theatrhythm.
2110448	2111690	I love that game.
2111710	2113932	I need to go back and play more, to be quite honest.
2114384	2139514	now here's something else going on kind of in tandem with this whole thing and that is that Square Enix is going to be using generative AI to automate 70% of game Q&A or Q&A not that kind of Q&A game quality assurance QA by 2027 this is interesting let's
2139494	2143359	I actually want to hear this out a little bit because I think this could be interesting.
2143379	2147745	So they're going to be using Gen AI to automate 70% of Game QA.
2148747	2151290	This was all part of the financial results.
2151390	2157058	There is what's called the Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology using Generative AI.
2157078	2162485	And what they'll be doing is they're going to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.
2162525	2167392	And they hope to establish a competitive advantage in game development.
2167372	2170836	and of course, you know, AI is a pretty controversial thing.
2170856	2172138	We all know that.
2172158	2175261	I, I'm, and this may surprise you.
2175722	2179025	I'm a little hesitant to dog on this right now.
2179045	2188657	I do think that I'm ready to dog on it when it needs to be, but I think we need to sort of see, because what's important to note, the layoff story did not talk about QA.
2188997	2190819	It was, that was publishing things like that.
2190859	2193362	So it was not specifically talking about QA.
2193342	2212836	I think this could be interesting if the part of Q&A is running certain game loops and exploring certain game loops over and over again that could be interesting to see how automation could accelerate that that being said Square Enix would be a much better company
2212816	2224128	if it were to upskill these particular workers that are doing QA right now to be able to fix some of these bugs that are maybe, let's say, the low-hanging fruit.
2224188	2226370	I'm grossly simplifying this, I will admit.
2226671	2230375	I'm making this sound like a turn the graphics up on level three type of scenario.
2230395	2242047	But what I mean is that if they could actually provide more of these employees the toolkits to actually be helping to fix some of the bugs that AI identifies, this entire process would probably speed up significantly.
2242027	2251328	But I think something important as we all groan when we hear that AI is going to be doing the QA, most of this is outsourced anyway.
2252101	2275797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2275777	2294916	AI to uh so we can fire people and lower the numbers I really truly believe you get what you pay for in that regard and if instead they were to let's have AI try to identify some of these repetitive game loops and and discover the low-hanging fruit so that our QA team can tackle how to fix the problem
2294896	2318524	Oh, for sure, for sure.
2319533	2320494	Yeah.
2320755	2325102	And for me, like I said, I'm all for assistive, not generative.
2328106	2329548	SGO 100 Matt says, correct.
2329649	2337300	A lot of Q&A is outsourced to different companies on contract jobs.
2337321	2338082	Yeah.
2338102	2338943	Interesting.
2340037	2340438	All right.
2340518	2352854	Well, we'll see what develops with this and what this ultimately means in the next couple of years, because I mean, it will be interesting if games are released with AI, whatever quality, and they're still buggy.
2353856	2357921	It's just going to be interesting to see what all develops from that.
2357941	2359043	All right.
2359143	2362227	Let's move on and talk about and seven day happened this week, right?
2362528	2362988	DarkSakura?
2363289	2364230	Yes.
2364250	2368816	It's like a Mass Effect holiday, except there wasn't much to celebrate this year, but a little bit, a little bit.
2369437	2369537	Yeah.
2369517	2388876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2388856	2394565	It will be set after the original trilogy, so we probably won't have Shepard.
2395747	2397530	Is this going to tell us which ending is canon?
2399934	2403480	But there's also a little bit of an update about the next game.
2403520	2404962	It is still in development.
2405102	2408548	EA and Bioware are still going to be pushing this out.
2409329	2413075	That was from a blog post by Mike Gamble.
2413055	2414437	He is quite insane.
2414457	2422611	The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at Bioware, but the team is heads down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect.
2422631	2428100	We have a lot of universe to cover, a lot of features to build, and a lot of romances to figure out.
2428120	2429462	As long as Garrus is in it!
2430124	2430464	I'm kidding.
2432187	2433409	But yeah...
2434874	2439921	It looks like they're just trying to let us know it's still going to happen.
2440161	2441082	Still going to happen.
2441823	2442845	And then the TV show.
2443445	2451476	With all the news around EA recently, I appreciate the reinforcement because I think there was a part of that that maybe was in question a little bit.
2451496	2452958	So I appreciate the reinforcement.
2453979	2458165	I wonder if they're just going to be CGing the non-humans, you know.
2459967	2465924	or if the whole thing will be like a CG deal, you know, how are they going to do Turians?
2466204	2467508	Jim Henson puppetry.
2467709	2468330	Make it happen.
2469373	2470416	That's what I want.
2471830	2473572	I'm not sure that's going to happen.
2473592	2476776	It's not, but let me live my fantasy.
2476796	2499964	Although, speaking of Jim Henson puppetry, there is something, look, if you are a gay man or live your life like one, let me tell you, there's something even more exciting in media that just got announced this week, way more so than the Mass Effect TV series, and that is that Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone are co-producing a Miss Piggy film
2499944	2500666	What?
2500927	2507811	That Cole Escola, the screenwriter and star of Oh Mary on Broadway is writing.
2508905	2509866	I know.
2510447	2511788	Exactly, right?
2512449	2515813	Gay gasps heard around the world on that one.
2515933	2520899	That is gay culture, is that headline I just read to you.
2523682	2523822	Wow.
2523842	2535976	It's nice to know in this incredibly shitty year where my marriage may once again be up for debate at the Supreme Court that I have something to look forward to in my life, so let me have this Miss Piggy movie, goddammit.
2535996	2538118	Let me have something to look forward to.
2539550	2540491	Anyway.
2542774	2544436	Oh, I had a little asterisk as well.
2544456	2545797	I had a small N7 update.
2545857	2550022	I wouldn't expect to be on Jamie's radar, but it was definitely on mine because it's a game I follow.
2550042	2557170	If you are a No Man's Sky person, the special Normandy expedition is back.
2557190	2561776	They launched it on N7 day and it's only running for maybe another week or so.
2561816	2563718	I want to say it was maybe through the 18th.
2563698	2572652	So if you don't have your Normandy in No Man's Sky and you own that game, I would encourage, especially those of you that picked it up on Switch, I don't know if you've had the chance to get it yet.
2572672	2574234	And I think that might be Mish in that boat.
2574254	2575997	There might be some other folks out there.
2576497	2578000	I would encourage you to do it.
2578220	2579963	It's a fairly quick expedition.
2580123	2582427	And by fairly quick, I mean it's still going to be a few hours.
2582687	2584069	I haven't played it at all.
2584792	2590119	I might... Well, if you struggle a little bit, I'll help you out.
2590960	2596208	But I don't remember it being a super difficult expedition, but yeah, you're going to have to kind of get the feel of the game.
2597189	2602116	But yeah, you can get to Normandy in No Man's Sky for about another week and a half or so.
2602736	2604078	Make sure you start the expedition.
2604158	2611348	Usually, you have to start the expedition, and then you might have another three or four days past the end date, but you want to get it started, if nothing else.
2611548	2612790	So just...
2612770	2614953	Just a courtesy announcement for those of you out there.
2616676	2625289	I believe it's still a Game Pass thing, too, if your Game Pass hasn't already run out with everything, which I don't fault you for if you let that cancel.
2625369	2625669	What else?
2625689	2630997	But that's, I believe, a Game Pass thing still, too, so you can get it in that ecosystem.
2631017	2635885	I'm noticing Bobby in chat says, I lost the rewards on PS5, so I might have to redo the expedition.
2635905	2636946	So, yeah, there you go.
2638148	2639570	All right, let's move on.
2639630	2640111	Loki.
2641407	2642929	All right, let's talk.
2643610	2645874	It feels like a misconnection a little bit.
2645974	2651122	So I think there was a comment by Keanu Reeves a while back.
2651563	2661138	Actually, not that far back, but basically saying he would love to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand in the next Cyberpunk game.
2661939	2669170	And now we have, you know, the developers of said Cyberpunk game saying...
2670061	2673368	Hit us up!
2673388	2677658	So hopefully, hopefully we can make something work.
2677678	2678460	But, yeah.
2681486	2681787	Cool.
2683050	2685115	Johnny Silverhand was an awesome character.
2685135	2689825	So I'd love to see what Keanu Reeves could do for another game.
2691357	2697368	Keanu Reeves was that cyberpunk reboot through the bad and the good.
2697729	2705123	That was the whole announcement where somebody in the crowd had shouted, you're beautiful, and he goes, no, you're beautiful.
2705163	2705824	That was that, right?
2706145	2707307	Yes, it was.
2707287	2710150	Keanu Reeves really embodies that series at this point.
2710230	2713113	I realize it didn't start with him, but it's his now.
2713854	2719640	I do hope that if they continue with what's going on in the Cyberpunk universe, which I think they will.
2719720	2724846	I do feel like Cyberpunk's had enough of a victory lap of sorts between the Switch 2 release.
2725626	2727268	It's kind of redeemed itself.
2727809	2729170	As some video games get to do.
2729250	2731372	I think Cyberpunk's been able to run that victory lap.
2731413	2734416	I hope that if they explore the future, they do it with Keanu Reeves.
2734516	2735657	Because like...
2736413	2752414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2752394	2774402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2774382	2800373	All right.
2800876	2802258	We'll see what continues with that.
2802398	2803600	Oh no, it was breathtaking.
2803640	2805743	Sorry, Mike Deft says you're breathtaking.
2805783	2806284	Sorry.
2806584	2808687	Yeah, and Neil Patrick Harris as well.
2808927	2810309	Yes, yes.
2810409	2811951	Captain Spike.
2811991	2816257	Hi, Spike, from GameBooey.org, Video Game Podcast.
2816578	2818681	So lovely to see you in chat.
2818821	2826131	Reminds that Matthew Lillard also had a role in the Twin Peaks reboot, which it was a small role, but it was an important one.
2826171	2827453	He was very good in that.
2828094	2830377	I support anything related to Twin Peaks.
2830357	2854002	I haven't watched too much of Twin Peaks but I know my other cast members on Channel 64 enjoy watching Twin Peaks because it's strange and so there will be many nights that we are in voice chat together and he's streaming Twin Peaks for us to watch and it's strange and it doesn't make any sense to me but it's
2853982	2872513	I fucking love Twin Peaks I would encourage everybody to at least watch the original pilot and keep in mind you have to keep in mind in the back of your mind when you watch the pilot it aired on TV in 1989, 1990 I don't remember the exact day I think it was maybe early April 1990 I was in middle school and I tried to watch it in middle school
2872493	2902500	and when you watch it you're gonna be kind of taken with two things you're gonna be like this is very slow moving and very like intentional but also extremely unsettling it's extremely unsettling television and you kind of go this set the tone for so much more that's come after it there is so much that is influenced by what Twin Peaks did and you know and then if you ever watch the episode that reveals Laura's killer which I think we all know the answer to that now but I will I will
2902480	2904382	Let you have that.
2904423	2907467	If you don't know, I will let you have that.
2907487	2918281	But I will say the whole sequence where that is played out and that is revealed is one of the scariest, most unsettling, most fucked up things.
2918301	2921445	I cannot believe that aired on television, to be quite honest.
2921465	2923508	In the 90s, nonetheless.
2923528	2926431	It was event television.
2926451	2931458	The second season of Twin Peaks after that point...
2931438	2956416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2956396	2958239	The movie's really not in a bad way.
2958339	2963627	It's just really like the topics and what's at hand is very unsettling.
2963647	2965970	But if you can get through it, the movie's powerful.
2966371	2974603	And I think it's one of those things that time has done that movie a lot of favors, like a lot of movies that sort of got rejected by audiences on the first go.
2975084	2976486	Anyway, that's my Twin Peaks rant.
2976847	2978790	I'm glad I could get one more in before it's all over.
2978910	2979911	Everybody should watch Twin Peaks.
2979951	2981574	It's one of the best television shows of all time.
2981694	2981894	All right.
2981914	2983337	Thank you.
2984819	2985019	All right.
2984999	2988343	DJ Ranma S says, but Rob, Twin Peaks was on at 10 p.m.
2988383	2990085	You could get away with a lot in that time slot.
2990105	2990566	You right.
2992508	2994912	Captain Spike says, it's intense, but so good.
2994952	2995993	The movie, Fire Walk With Me.
2996413	2997595	I did not get it as a kid.
2997875	3002501	Well, number one, you probably shouldn't have watched it as a kid, but I get it.
3002962	3004083	We all watch things we shouldn't have.
3004383	3011713	But number two, yes, a lot like would have gone over my head at that age that I think now it's like, oh, this is very disturbing.
3012253	3013555	So anyway.
3014159	3039998	I want a proper Twin Peaks video game I don't not that I think that would I think like Alan Wake is the closest I'm ever going to get and you know I realize it also be really weird with David Lynch no longer with us unfortunately I feel like something not sort of endorsed directly by him would feel wrong but you know in a perfect world we would have got we will discover that he wrote a treatment for a video game before he passed but I just don't expect that that's the case
3041277	3041978	All right, now I'm done.
3042218	3043140	Let's talk about Steam.
3043160	3049991	Let's talk about the place that you could buy all of these video games that are hypothetical in my mind.
3050191	3051974	Steam is one of those places.
3051994	3054598	And Steam's been doing some updates lately.
3054618	3057242	They've done a few things recently and now they're doing another.
3057262	3058965	It's a new look and feel.
3058945	3064191	Pages are now wider with support for higher resolution images.
3064431	3067775	So those of y'all with 4K monitors, Steam's catching up here.
3067795	3070738	New viewing modes for trailers and screenshots.
3070758	3073501	And now there's some new formatting options.
3073521	3076264	Pages have been widened to 1200 pixels.
3077325	3081730	That means now they can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page.
3081929	3089745	and there's a large pop-up view called the theater mode as well as a full screen mode for trailers and things like that.
3090518	3093521	No new look on the homepage yet.
3093561	3097786	This is just games store pages and bundle detail pages.
3097806	3111480	But, you know, considering Steam launched in an era where people didn't have widescreen monitors on the whole, and now I think widescreens have been the standard for quite some time, you know, and 4Ks are more and more.
3111520	3114603	Maybe not everybody has them, but there's still more and more than they were.
3115564	3117066	You know, it's...
3117046	3119933	Probably smart that the Steam store has evolved to match that a little bit.
3119993	3125607	I think the theater mode is really good, too, for the trailers and screenshots to really get a sense of what does this look like.
3126389	3128575	And plus, we're going to have a Steam sale in what?
3128835	3129758	Black Friday is what?
3129778	3130560	Three weeks away?
3130580	3133346	So we should have a Thanksgiving or holiday, whatever they call it.
3133667	3134008	No.
3133988	3137137	Holiday is going to be through all the end of the year events.
3137258	3138722	It's like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.
3138742	3140728	Yeah, there'll be a Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale.
3140748	3142273	There always is.
3142894	3145221	Trying to think of what I might pick up on a sale like that.
3145261	3147508	I'm trying to think of what I missed throughout the year.
3148788	3169125	I might have to get Claire Obscure because I'm letting Xbox Game Pass go so I'm probably gonna have to pick Claire Obscure is good yeah no I know I just didn't finish it so I'm gonna have to buy it to finish it I also I'm gonna have to buy No Man's Sky if I let Game Pass go because all of my unlocks are on Xbox although no it's cross platform with Steam isn't it maybe I don't have to let it go that would be nice
3170101	3186118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3186790	3200641	It was, I mean, basically there had been other spinoffs like Splatterhouse, One Paku Graffiti, but this was a Famicom title that was going to do an RPG called Splatterworld.
3200661	3203888	And it was supposed to launch in March of 1993, but was canceled.
3203868	3208755	But there was promotional material that had been distributed.
3208976	3214123	Japanese retailers had this information as of 1992, so it was pretty close to being finished.
3214143	3216547	Well, we now have a working ROM.
3217268	3224118	It was announced by West Mansion and uploaded to 4chan.
3224559	3230027	It works in FCEUX, which...
3230007	3235535	It works there because of a Namco mapper that they needed.
3235556	3242907	But when I checked it out, there was a fixed version, a ROM fix on it.
3242927	3244349	So there are two versions out.
3244409	3246212	This was as of the first.
3246232	3248515	So I'm going to test it out and see if it works.
3248575	3252201	But yeah, you can play Splatterworld.
3252417	3254882	I just think it's cool they made an RPG in that universe.
3255262	3255743	You know?
3255763	3256465	That's kind of awesome.
3256906	3257567	I'm curious.
3257587	3258268	I'm super curious.
3258408	3260112	I'd play the shit out of that.
3260132	3260733	Maybe that's a retro.
3260813	3262236	Maybe that's what I should play.
3262917	3263919	I'm very curious.
3263959	3265742	I'll check it out if you do.
3265762	3266043	Alright.
3267987	3268848	Let's move on.
3268868	3269129	Loki.
3270732	3271433	Alright.
3271453	3272856	Well...
3273764	3275146	Let's talk about movies.
3276087	3280573	We know The Legend of Zelda movie is right around the corner and it is filming.
3281594	3284458	So they have started filming in, I know, New Zealand.
3285118	3289424	Crazy that a fantasy movie... That's where all the pretty movies go.
3289544	3290365	That's where they all go.
3290425	3291667	Yeah, yeah.
3291747	3298135	So yeah, it's started filming and yeah, I don't know... Do we have any...
3298115	3299837	Do we have any listeners in New Zealand?
3300217	3300958	That's what I want to know.
3300998	3302120	I don't think we have any live.
3302841	3305263	Podcast, do we have anybody in New Zealand that listens to this show?
3305584	3307046	And can I come stay at your house?
3307066	3309268	Because New Zealand looks really pretty.
3309288	3311671	We're always talking about all these movies.
3311911	3313233	This is gorgeous.
3313253	3315515	I'm like, imagine living there.
3315535	3319680	You remember Melon Punk Night, right?
3319720	3320241	Yeah.
3320980	3322382	Yeah, they're moving to New Zealand.
3322502	3323323	Are they really?
3324344	3332614	I knew they were leaving their house in the place that it is now, not doxing my friends on air, but I did not know it was because they're going to New Zealand.
3332634	3334135	They're going to New Zealand.
3334336	3336318	Is this like a get the fuck out of America thing?
3336498	3337800	Live in the dream, jealous?
3338240	3339281	Yes, I think so.
3339321	3345689	It's a very punk night thing to do, but hey, hey, I'm speaking from a place of jealousy.
3345709	3347451	Like, that sounds amazing.
3347471	3347771	Good.
3347931	3348913	I have somebody to crash with.
3348953	3350194	Yay.
3351035	3351816	Make some room.
3352777	3353638	Uncle Rob's coming.
3355621	3357123	I want to go see The Hobbit House.
3358565	3360787	Of course, the Zelda movie is still a ways away.
3361388	3362810	It's like, I think, April 2027.
3365253	3367095	Maybe Grand Theft Auto 6 will be out by then.
3367656	3369679	Oh, is this a new game?
3369839	3372502	What comes out first, Grand Theft Auto 6 or the Zelda movie?
3374845	3375706	I think the Zelda movie.
3376667	3378730	I think the Zelda movie, actually.
3379385	3380306	Maybe, I don't know.
3380526	3381147	It's hard to say.
3382870	3387235	Are you interested in this movie that they're doing?
3387255	3389758	Oh yeah, absolutely.
3389778	3394004	I think they're trying to figure out what game it's based off of, but we just have too little information.
3394404	3400412	I actually kind of hope, like similar to the Mass Effect TV series Jamie brought up earlier, I kind of hope it's actually not tied to a game.
3400953	3404317	I think, how would y'all feel if it was like an original story?
3404337	3407581	Because we have all of these... It should be based off of the cartoon.
3407982	3408042	Oh.
3408022	3436527	excuse me princess I don't although if they slip that line in there somewhere even if it's just something like he utters under his breath you know what's gonna happen you put it in the trailer 40 year olds will lose their fucking minds it's gonna be a fucking chicken jockey moment if we get excuse me princess you know what you need to do I think the line's gonna be there but Link isn't gonna say it
3436507	3444596	Oh, like give it to another character, like a shopkeeper or something type of character.
3444876	3446518	That could be interesting.
3446558	3451303	They really need to quote as much as they can from the CDI version of the game.
3451323	3452604	I know, just put them in there.
3453105	3453846	I get it.
3453866	3454567	It's obscure.
3455007	3456028	It'd make me happy, though.
3456088	3456669	Put that in there.
3456869	3458150	And excuse me, Princess, you got it.
3458431	3460793	And then, yeah, what was that?
3460813	3461314	I'm so hungry.
3461354	3463216	I could eat a, what was it?
3463596	3464938	An Octorok or something like that?
3465458	3466159	I don't remember.
3466325	3467126	from the cartoon.
3467767	3481122	I actually think the line in the trailer that would get the gas from the audience would be the old, like, it should start and it should be like this, you know, going into this very dark cave and it's very dark.
3481142	3485186	And there's this old man who's lit very, very subtly by fire.
3485206	3488891	And he just looks at the camera and says, it's dangerous to go alone.
3488911	3489972	Take this.
3489992	3491894	And then it goes into the whole thing.
3491914	3494577	I think that's the line that would get people to be honest.
3495451	3496452	But we'll see, we'll see.
3496953	3500719	I feel like this is going to be an art thing.
3500979	3506927	It's not going to shitify itself with all these references.
3506967	3510012	We're not asking you to just do this for the whole movie.
3510873	3516361	Less than 1% of the movie has this kind of crap in it.
3516401	3517162	It's fine.
3517503	3519906	It's a silly nod.
3519886	3521508	It's a wink at the camera.
3521548	3523672	Yes, a wink at the camera is all we ask.
3523692	3526135	And excuse me, princess, you can get away with it.
3526155	3532164	You can fit it into the script and still have your arthouse film that gets Oscar nominations because I bet that's what they're ultimately going for.
3532184	3539835	Hell, if the, you know, whatever the D&D movie was, if they could have the animated team show up in it, then, I mean...
3540119	3541781	God, the D&D movie is so good.
3541802	3543444	I hope we get a sequel for that soon.
3543504	3544285	Oh, I'm sure you will.
3544305	3544846	It was so good.
3545467	3546188	So, so good.
3547029	3550154	So, yeah, I'm excited.
3550174	3552478	And I think the story could be an original story.
3552518	3563033	I think the internet's focusing way too much on which game are they adapting without realizing that all the games, they all exist in the different parallel parts of the universe and timelines, really.
3563053	3564936	It's all these different timelines, right?
3564956	3568101	I think the movie should just exist in another timeline.
3568081	3590629	that can then maybe subtly tie itself to one of the games at the end or something but I think the movie should just exist in its own timeline because I think to adapt one of the games literally it's never going to be good enough for the internet it's never going to be good enough for the internet and it's not like the Mario movie had to adapt one of the games and it was fine so I would say the Zelda movie does its own fucking thing and it'll be fine
3591706	3592928	but one little wink.
3593148	3593949	That's all we ask.
3594210	3595191	One little wink.
3595211	3598576	And then SJ100Matt says, the movie ends with the warp pipe showing up.
3598636	3600760	Yes, and the invitation to the Smash Brothers film.
3600840	3601100	Yes.
3601821	3603364	No, no, it's not going to happen.
3603964	3608271	Y'all are, you're putting the asks way up here.
3608371	3610234	You're putting the asks way up here.
3610294	3611816	That would just be weird.
3612477	3616063	Unless, yeah, it's just weird.
3616844	3618206	Unless puppets.
3618626	3619688	We've talked about this.
3620815	3621256	Alright.
3621918	3629660	I mean, this other movie shouldn't have been animated, but... In all reality, though, I really hope that Link is mostly silent.
3631104	3631887	I'll be curious.
3632228	3633692	A man of few words.
3634193	3636259	Because men shouldn't speak.
3638264	3640447	Alright, moving on.
3641028	3643091	Let's talk about Atari 50.
3643191	3646336	That's right, this game that keeps on giving, in a good way.
3646416	3661639	It's because, you know, obviously we had all these different digital eclipse collections that have spawned off of what Atari 50 sort of laid down, including the recent Mortal Kombat collection, which I heard got a patch this week, so I'm curious to see if it helped with some of the issues, but I've been too busy in hell and Diablo.
3661619	3689483	and DarkSakura.com.
3689463	3690925	Galaga for $7,800.
3691306	3694431	Galaxian for the $2,600, the $5,200, and the Atari 8-bit.
3694952	3697035	Pac-Man for the $5,200, the $2,600.
3697636	3700841	Yes, the $2,600 version of Pac-Man being released again.
3701282	3702905	And the Atari 8-bit.
3702925	3706110	And Xevious for the $7,800 and the arcade.
3706570	3709395	I think the documentary part of this, I'm...
3709544	3714528	It's funny, we all shiver or shudder when we think about the 2600 version of Pac-Man.
3714549	3721154	But, you know, it was a really like what they got away with in that cart size.
3721275	3728601	Because what I believe I recall the story going, the guy who programmed it asked for an 8K cart size.
3728941	3734186	But because that would have made the game more expensive, he got told, no, it has to fit into 4K.
3734827	3739551	And so he had to make the Atari 2600 do fucking party tricks left and right.
3739531	3761269	You said it was, was it also Inky and Clyde?
3761249	3764112	Well, what and what surprises me is that it must.
3764512	3765353	Well, no, they were there.
3765453	3767415	They didn't have the personalities in 2600 version.
3767435	3768976	But anyway, I was joking.
3769056	3769276	I know.
3769296	3769516	I know.
3769837	3771939	But I wish they would put this side by side.
3771959	3779265	I mean, I guess we have the 5200 version, which wasn't a more proper size card, but I wish they would put Pac-Man for the 2600 side by side with Ms.
3779325	3783649	Pac-Man for the 2600 because that did end up in an 8K card.
3783769	3785871	And you see that it is a lot more arcade.
3786171	3791256	I mean, it's still not perfect, but it's a lot more arcade accurate than the original Pac-Man was.
3791236	3811557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3811537	3812519	All right.
3812679	3815524	All right.
3817146	3832752	All right.
3832732	3835877	Let's see, looking in chat, YYR says, this is really cool.
3835937	3842106	Despite how awful the Atari 2600 Pac-Man was, I kind of want to see the interviews about that legendarily awful game.
3842186	3843127	Exactly.
3843147	3846132	Because it's a very similar deal with E.T.
3846833	3859211	And hearing Howard Scott Warshaw, who made, you know, and you all know this is the infamous thing he always talks about, he made the worst 2600 game of all time, E.T., and he made one of the best Atari 2600 games of all time, Yars' Revenge.
3859491	3862215	There was other stuff in between there, too, like the Indiana Jones game and stuff.
3862195	3877032	so um it's interesting to hear him talk about ET and how that game coming together as fast as it did was a miracle too and probably involved a lot of cocaine but I don't think he talks about that allegedly but I don't think he talks about that part um
3877484	3878465	So let's see.
3878545	3880928	Any other questions here or comments in chat?
3881689	3882410	S2100 Matt.
3883411	3884472	Perfect.
3884493	3888758	S2100 Matt says, if those glass coffee tables during those planning sessions could talk.
3889198	3892222	And PodCulture says, more snow than a ski resort.
3892602	3893624	You get it.
3893644	3894184	You get it.
3894425	3894765	All right.
3895586	3896547	Let's go on.
3897368	3900572	Since we're talking about classic games, what a nice segue to our next segment.
3910913	3918287	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3918768	3923156	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3923176	3924359	This will be a fun one tonight.
3924539	3927184	DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for the game of the week?
3927923	3946573	Rise of the Triad
3946553	3954127	It is a first-person shooter that was developed and published by Apogee Software, now 3D Realms.
3954147	3960258	In 1995, you can play as one of five different characters, and each of them has their own attributes.
3960278	3964225	You can have the fast one, the sneaky one, the enduring one, the strong one, blah, blah.
3964441	3975400	and you follow these characters through their story as they have to investigate a cult and then they learn about a plot to destroy the city.
3975861	3986279	There is a remake by Interceptor Entertainment and it was released by Apogee in 2013 and then there is a shareware version called Rise of the Triad The Hunt Begins.
3986299	3988002	We'll go into those in a bit.
3987982	3996918	So a little history is that it started as a follow-up game to Wolfenstein 3D, but was altered and became a standalone.
3998180	4000184	It has single player and multiplayer.
4001265	4004531	You can connect with other gamers and tackle missions as a team.
4005252	4010682	It is powered by a modified version of the Wolfenstein 3D engine.
4010662	4014716	and it was supposed to be called Wolfenstein 3D to the Rise of the Triad.
4015719	4020857	That idea was scrapped by id Software and Apogee bought the license.
4021951	4031884	So, anyway, you have to collect these keys as you go through the level, and you have to do different tactics and solve problems.
4032364	4042137	Your characters have different traits that depend on, you have hit point speed accuracy, etc.
4043669	4070335	in the shareware version you only have one of the characters and he's set for a very average there are enemies that can beg for their life if they take enough damage or fake their death there are enemies that dodge the attack some try to ambush you it's pretty pretty intense and all of the enemies are digitized actors played by Apogee employees and relatives and friends
4070315	4076663	And then on those occasions, there are a large amount of gibs.
4076683	4078365	Ludicrous gibs!
4078385	4079005	That's what you get.
4079126	4079786	Ludicrous gibs.
4080768	4086474	As YYR just happened to say in that.
4086675	4089718	Basically, they're giblets.
4090039	4091500	Like, body parts.
4092502	4094724	So, anyway.
4095766	4096947	So...
4099002	4101506	As you go through, you have 13 different weapons.
4101526	4105071	You have bullet weapons, missile weapons, and magic weapons.
4105091	4106773	So you can go through with all of that.
4107094	4109898	And you can only have one power-up active at one time.
4109998	4114645	There is the multiplayer called COM-BAT, C-O-M-M-B-A-T.
4115546	4120774	And you can have up to 11 players simultaneously, each with different uniform colors.
4121815	4125280	But in team mode, you have a single uniform color for each team.
4125260	4127423	Nine different multiplayer modes.
4127624	4128285	Deathmatch.
4130448	4134635	You have a tag mode, kind of like the kids game.
4134815	4135977	You have a hunter mode.
4135997	4137900	So you have the hunter and the prey.
4137920	4138741	There's capture the flag.
4138761	4139803	There's a few different ones.
4141085	4146954	So like I said, this started off as a follow-up to Wolfenstein 3D.
4149718	4150339	And...
4152293	4153495	It just like, okay, we're done.
4153775	4157400	And so Apogee bought what was left there.
4158281	4167013	And then the game, you know, they were going to use that same engine code for Wolfenstein 3D, new levels, art characters.
4168395	4177727	But as they were getting further into development, their project leader, Scott Miller, was contacted by John Romero, who...
4178332	4180455	Tell Miller that the project had been canceled.
4181316	4185642	So that was... It didn't want to take anything away from Doom.
4186183	4190329	So that's why it went over and Apogee got it.
4190349	4192492	And they just removed all the Nazi stuff.
4194575	4196998	Good.
4196978	4200585	So anyway, there's a lot more about that.
4200706	4203151	But there also is some cut content.
4204514	4207019	Some of the enemies had female versions.
4209484	4217400	The game was going to load both sets of guards into the memory and then randomly determine what you get.
4217752	4224038	But it really made the memory requirements much higher, so they removed the alternates.
4224979	4228702	There are stills, though, that you can see of actors cut from the game.
4230344	4233907	There were other levels, like the Rot Reject level pack.
4234128	4243877	Those were the stages that were cut from the game, and you can get that level pack to play them, and different artwork that you can find on the CD.
4245747	4251706	So at any rate, the game was distributed as shareware, so the first episode was for free.
4252669	4253833	And then...
4254944	4256987	It had 10 original levels.
4257027	4259952	It was called Rise of the Triad, The Hunt Begins.
4259972	4261615	So, of course, there was those limitations.
4261635	4266082	As I said, you could only play as one character, and there were only four of the multiplayer modes.
4266262	4278201	There was the deluxe of the shareware, which was retailed by LaserSoft, and it had three extra levels and three extra multiplayer that you could only play on their version.
4278839	4284308	and then there were different versions of the full game too with three new episodes.
4284749	4290599	So it was a floppy disk and a CD version that both had the 32 game levels and the three new episodes.
4291200	4294666	The CD version had more multiplayer levels.
4294686	4301758	The site license version had several multiplayer levels and you could play up to 11 different computers on a network.
4302110	4305914	I have played this in this mode a while back.
4306575	4307435	It was a long time ago.
4308917	4320128	In 2009, Rise of the Triad was released on GOG.com through DOSBox, and so it can be played on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
4320149	4325374	I don't know if it's playable on the current macOS.
4325434	4327476	I would think that's Intel-based.
4327456	4337047	So as I said, Apogee released a reject level pack that was a lot of the cut ones, things that were unsuitable for the release.
4338929	4340811	This was released on July 25th, 1995.
4341552	4350361	And you could also play as Dopefish, who, that's my friend.
4351382	4351643	Anyway.
4354165	4357429	So at any rate,
4358050	4359152	And by the way, if you're listening, hi.
4359773	4376903	Anyway, there was an official retail of the level pack that was released by Apogee for the ROTT called Extreme Rise of the Triad, also in 1995.
4378486	4387008	And actually, the add-on was produced by a couple of people in the series.
4387068	4388391	One of them is my friend Joe.
4388652	4388993	Hi, Joe.
4390416	4391820	And the other was Tom Hall.
4392661	4398832	But the maps that were produced in this are harder than the original ones.
4398932	4402038	There were some definitely tricks that were involved in making it.
4402419	4405104	These levels were released as freeware September 1st, 2000.
4405685	4416745	And then the rest of the remaining stuff was put out as freeware as ROTT Goodies Pack on February 15th, 2005.
4417197	4424035	um so there are other level packs um there was the laser soft deluxe shareware maps um
4425567	4431817	Actually, Apogee re-released those themselves after Lasersoft went out of business.
4432418	4443796	There's another level called Wolf 3D that was meant to see if the geography from Wolfenstein 3D could be replicated in Rise of the Triad, since it used the same engine.
4445959	4447221	There are...
4448399	4459270	there's the Ohio RTC pack that was a four level multiplayer pack that was designed for group in Ohio holding a game tourney called Bloodfest 96 um
4460178	4463082	And the last one was called You and Spray.
4464044	4470653	And this was a gag, 1998, to play at the level editor.
4471354	4472696	And it was released in November 2000.
4472896	4483772	So the source code for Rise of the Triad was released under the GNU GPL 2.0 or later on December 20th, 2002.
4483752	4495392	and then it had been ported by fans to Amiga OS, Linux, Mac OS, Xbox, Dreamcast, PSP and Nintendo DS Homebrew and 32-bit Windows.
4496274	4503887	The game was included in the Fedora software repository so it was a free port.
4504559	4506222	There was the remaster.
4506242	4512433	3D Realms did Realms Deep 2020 livestream and showed the game playing on a Switch.
4513215	4517583	And that would also play on Windows, Switch, PS4, Xbox for 2021 release.
4518545	4524255	At Realms Deep 2022, it was re-announced as Rise of the Triad, the Ludicrous Edition.
4524235	4537631	And the demo came out actually on June 19th, 2023 and was released on July 31st, 2023 and September 23rd, 2023 for consoles.
4538251	4540774	And that was for the 10th anniversary of the 2013 remake.
4542616	4551627	Yeah, the game is... A lot of people really consider this to be one of...
4553092	4556336	The games of its era.
4558880	4561343	Not everyone was super into it.
4561363	4564547	The iOS version was really not well received at all.
4564788	4566590	It got mediocre reviews.
4567151	4575863	But as far as the full version, DOS Spirit, Honest Gamers, PC Team, a lot of them were giving it... Next Generation gave it a 3 out of 5.
4576484	4581310	But a lot of folks just were really into it.
4581290	4603737	and then there as I mentioned there was a 2013 remake and that one was revealed at QuakeCon 2012 developed by sorry designed by Frederick Schreiber by Interceptor Entertainment and came out July 31st 2013 through Steam and GOG and that's it all right
4604999	4606461	One that I think I played briefly.
4606481	4609826	I think I played the shareware version of this briefly, but never really played the full thing.
4609846	4615835	But, you know, just kind of watching this YouTube, I go, oh, this is definitely a throwback to that era of first-person shooters.
4616156	4619421	Yeah, Rise of the Triad, game of the week.
4619441	4619781	Fun pick.
4619802	4620202	Yep, yep.
4620943	4621364	All right.
4622105	4623748	Now I have to tell Joe I gave him a shout out.
4624949	4625190	Nice.
4625971	4626231	All right.
4626311	4630738	Well, we have just a few quick headlines here before we get into some release dates and the listener roundtable.
4630758	4632561	So let's get to some fast headlines.
4632581	4633943	Rapid Fire News, The Loki.
4634935	4640564	Oh, man, it's like it's it's time just continues to repeat itself.
4640665	4641546	But here we go.
4642007	4642528	Year 2025.
4642628	4654608	We're in the holiday season and Soulja Boy is out there just grinding and grinding by taking an existing product, claiming that honest question name on it.
4654748	4655289	Honest question.
4655349	4657112	Is Soulja Boy still relevant?
4657582	4658705	I'm not trying to sound shady.
4658726	4660050	I'm just asking an honest question.
4660090	4661855	Is Soulja Boy still relevant?
4661875	4663741	I don't know.
4665246	4665707	Never mind.
4665847	4669920	The comparison I was going to make was extremely unfair, so I'm just going to let it move on.
4672010	4679926	So yes, he is attempting to take an existing device, a device that I actually own, by the way.
4680307	4687401	He's taking a device to the, was it the Retroid Pocket Flip 2?
4687642	4688223	This one right here.
4689325	4691149	Basically...
4691129	4707450	and DarkSakura.com
4708561	4710103	Vint got called out.
4711005	4716773	The Retroid team, the actual company developers, like, we did not authorize this.
4717815	4719858	I didn't know about this.
4719878	4722302	This is not any kind of official licensee deal.
4722342	4726348	He does not have permission to rebrand our product and sell them as his own.
4726368	4729813	The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S.
4730073	4731035	by ourselves.
4731796	4733138	Like, you cannot do that.
4734120	4734400	Um...
4735932	4738256	And so now he's marked them down.
4738296	4743425	They're now $200 on his site.
4743445	4744066	Alright.
4744166	4745689	No, that's not going to be good enough.
4746551	4747913	They need to nail him.
4749897	4751099	It's just ridiculous.
4751119	4753603	Like, you just can't...
4754292	4755815	Is his brain just broken?
4756156	4758060	What is wrong with these people?
4759162	4759563	I don't know.
4759744	4763592	It's actually probably not that.
4763612	4774275	I find that typically, just in my limited experience with celebrities, but I've met a few over time, and more importantly, I've met the people they surround themselves with, that
4775572	4782900	really gas these people up one way, and then to the people around them, or the people that work with them, another way.
4783080	4785482	It's always this intermediary.
4786103	4791108	I would actually expect he knows very little about what's going on.
4791148	4792370	Yeah, it seems like that.
4792390	4792990	I'm sticking to it.
4794091	4797115	Because when he was showing off the console, he's like, look, see, it's got TikTok on it.
4797315	4799217	It's like, yeah, because it's an Android device.
4799297	4800478	Of course it has TikTok on it.
4801299	4803101	I don't know.
4803782	4804262	Is this...
4805288	4809413	I don't... Who's making their purchasing decisions based off of Soulja Boy?
4810114	4811576	That's a good question, too.
4811616	4818904	If you are making your purchasing decisions off of Soulja Boy, you gotta really look in and reflect on yourself and see where you've gone wrong.
4819545	4822549	Because you are in dire need of help.
4822589	4825052	Perhaps reach out to family and friends.
4825252	4826994	You have lost your way.
4827855	4829357	Soulja Boy, you got issues.
4831620	4831760	Mm-hmm.
4831780	4831920	Mm-hmm.
4833301	4835003	Now, can we get him to go on Shark Tank?
4835023	4836825	Because I want to see him pitch this on Shark Tank.
4838828	4840270	Just for the lulz.
4840650	4841531	Next story.
4842693	4847279	Anyways, next thing, a little bit more interesting, is Overcooked.
4847479	4857131	The crazy cooking game is now being adapted by A24 into perhaps a TV or movie.
4858072	4858713	TV series.
4859354	4860996	That could be...
4861027	4880385	I don't know how that would necessarily translate into like a cooking show, but Well, it's just going to be another knockoff of Hell's Kitchen It's just going to be people, instead of a chef screaming at people like Hell's Kitchen, it'll be them screaming at each other Hell's Kitchen and Wipeout together, you know, as one giant thing
4880517	4884703	Overcooked is one of those games that ends friendships like Mario Party.
4885024	4886406	I refuse to play it.
4887007	4889971	Which is a perfectly acceptable stance to take, quite honestly.
4890472	4894678	I've played it, but it's, you know, people get very intense in that game.
4895379	4897563	I think it really depends on who you play it with.
4898965	4902730	If everybody's high and doesn't care, it's fine.
4902750	4905394	If everybody's drunk and aggressive, not good.
4906336	4907097	Not good.
4907117	4907217	Yeah.
4908698	4910966	Okay, well, we'll see what happens with this.
4911608	4916003	But yeah, they're looking at doing something with TV and movies with it.
4916264	4916886	I mean...
4917305	4918867	Sure, I guess.
4919327	4922931	Well, I mean, Deft in chat says A24 is behind it, though.
4922992	4924013	My stamp of approval.
4924153	4925374	That is a fair point.
4925394	4926235	That is a fair point.
4926275	4928338	A24 does a lot of cool stuff.
4929339	4933303	DJ Ranma S says, I think Gordon Ramsay was connected to Overcooked for a bit.
4933624	4934244	Here's the thing.
4934264	4939831	I think what it is, is that Overcooked was inspired by like Gordon Ramsay cooking shows and stuff.
4939851	4943515	So it's it's you have this weird copy of a copy thing going on.
4943495	4959647	I still can't believe Hell's Kitchen is a show they're making.
4959627	4961570	How many seasons of that show has there been?
4961971	4963714	I don't know.
4964796	4967360	As many as Gordon Ramsay wants to make money off of.
4967380	4971847	I like the idea of Hell's Kitchen, but I don't... See, here's the thing.
4971908	4974031	I like the idea of competition shows like that.
4974792	4977637	I don't like them playing up the drama.
4977657	4980522	I just want a strict, like, hey, here's the teams...
4981683	4984352	Cool if we get to know them a little bit, you know, that's fine.
4984372	4988124	But, like, I don't want all the, like, oh, all the drama.
4988144	4989870	I just want, like...
4990272	4991894	Just an actual competition show.
4992315	4995159	Treat it like the Japanese version of Iron Chef.
4995179	4998945	I was going to say, I love the drama when it's Iron Chef drama.
4999726	5001929	When it's like the theatrics.
5002089	5002951	I think is a better way to put it.
5003051	5004032	I love the theatrics.
5004152	5005254	I love theatrics.
5005294	5005554	Yes.
5005715	5006476	I love that.
5006816	5012244	But just, can we have the theatrics and not the like... Which is why I miss American Gladiators.
5012364	5013927	I miss American Gladiators for the same thing.
5013987	5017392	The theatrics of that show was ridiculous.
5017412	5017512	Yeah.
5017492	5044967	MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef
5044947	5046348	MasterChef Kids.
5046669	5053596	Yeah, completely different Gordon Ramsay because Gordon Ramsay is a very good actor.
5053616	5057800	And when he's doing Hell's Kitchen, he plays a part.
5058341	5063426	When he's doing MasterChef, he's probably a little bit more of his authentic self.
5063446	5066309	Or it's side A and side B. He's playing a different part.
5066710	5071815	But I would like to think that MasterChef Junior is a little bit more of his authentic self than...
5071795	5083634	The character he plays on Hell's Kitchen I mean, it could be vice versa, but I doubt it Twice as critical, twice as explicit You want to see one where the kids are put through hell, don't you?
5084035	5097516	They're all crying, he's like, I'm not leaving this set until you're all in tears And they're regretting the choices they've made in their short lives The wrong Gordon Ramsay showed up today Alright DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5098576	5118935	Well, I had hinted at this earlier, but BioWare is insisting that there is still a new Mass Effect in development, that they are trying to make sure it fits into the Mass Effect canon, and it still would be itself a new game.
5119936	5128043	And they are very clear in saying that it's not, quote, a retread of Commander Shepard's story.
5130014	5132579	Of course, there's all that crap going on with EA.
5133601	5144140	And then there's a little bit more going on because they announced that partnership with Stability AI for AI-powered tools for development.
5144421	5147126	As long as they're tools and not generative, that's what I say.
5148969	5150672	But I mean...
5150652	5151373	Wait and see.
5151794	5152957	I'll buy it.
5153037	5155843	It's Mass Effect, and I'm a Mass Effect whore.
5156684	5157406	And how.
5158789	5159109	Yeah.
5159691	5161354	So, cool.
5162697	5165202	Actually, Garrus is currently calibrating and how.
5165435	5165776	I don't know.
5165836	5167819	I don't know how to match what I'm saying.
5167839	5168279	He's calibrating.
5169361	5169641	All right.
5169661	5170322	Let's talk about this.
5170362	5176251	Jason references the intro tonight and he's talking a little bit about what's going on in World of Warcraft.
5176271	5179917	And yes, World of Warcraft is making a new expansion, which does sound pretty cool.
5179977	5181099	The new Midnight expansion.
5181139	5184884	Of course, housing is finally coming to WoW, which a lot of people are excited about.
5184924	5188810	But uh-oh, we just found out about Hearthsteel.
5188930	5189591	What's that?
5189752	5190913	A new currency.
5191013	5192155	What kind of currency?
5192255	5193517	Premium currency.
5193898	5194699	For fuck's sake.
5194679	5221092	and Blizzard is saying that this new currency is supposed to be allowing you to do multiple items at once and offering this is my favorite part offering financial protections for folks involved you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table multiple place settings for your invited guests many candles using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient
5221072	5235283	and you can buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance or of course in-game gold via WoW tokens because there's that whole thing where there already is the gold that you can turn into real money which has existed in Warcraft for some time.
5235955	5240022	Anyway, so this was found from data miners.
5240042	5243948	Blizzard did confirm it, and people on Reddit are losing their minds.
5243968	5244489	So we'll see.
5244809	5261777	The thing is, and what has people concerned, and I get it, is that this is all being discovered weeks after we heard the story about Microsoft is pressuring all of their gaming companies, which Blizzard is one of now, to make sure you've got 30% profit margins.
5262803	5265710	They're called accountability margins at Microsoft now.
5265730	5266572	What a lovely name.
5267234	5268898	Anyway, something to think about.
5268918	5279884	I should point out though, World of Warcraft is still a premium MMO, meaning it is one of like three, I think, left on the market that actually charge a monthly fee.
5279864	5302075	Yep.
5303118	5304780	All right.
5305060	5310806	Fifth dream in chat says... I don't really have much of a desire to go back and play it again, although I do kind of sometimes miss playing.
5311127	5311407	I know.
5311427	5312909	I'm kind of like, I probably will.
5312949	5313429	I'm going to be honest.
5313449	5317894	I probably will check out the new expansion just because I enjoyed my time with this most recent one.
5317954	5322840	I didn't stay subbed, but I subbed for two or three months to finish the expansion, and it was fine.
5322980	5324121	I like the Dells.
5324141	5326644	I'm curious to see how they expand on that in the next expansion.
5327805	5332230	The housing thing, I don't get as into it as other people do.
5332210	5335199	I have a house in Final Fantasy XIV.
5336924	5341337	It doesn't really have a theme to it, so it is what it is.
5341357	5343484	I don't even have any desire to go back to that either.
5343945	5344988	I'm just like...
5345761	5346722	I don't know.
5346882	5347724	I'm playing Palia.
5348084	5374519	BobbyBlackWolf in chat is dropping the meme about Final Fantasy XIV with the free trial level 60 which is also just a really extended demo for that game but I will say in that game's case like the fact you get to it's Stormblood by Bobby you gotta update your meme it's not just Heavensward it's Stormblood now and up to level 70 but I would say that journey especially through Heavensward like Heavensward was probably my I don't know if it's my favorite but it's up there

5790637	5798764	It's your part of the show for you to send us comments, questions, if you want to pop anything in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you're more than welcome to.
5798824	5802788	We also, I know we have a couple emails tonight, we'll get to those in a moment, and we'll get to some phone calls.
5802828	5804249	I see at least one call in the green room.
5804750	5816661	I will just kind of, you know, remind folks, I think y'all already know, but we only have a couple episodes left after tonight, and the way things are shaping up, next week will be a pretty normal episode, but that will be, we will
5816641	5823149	We will end the normalcy on the nice number of 1,069, which I think is a great number to go out on.
5823910	5827775	But we will have one more, OLR the Final, on November 23rd.
5827835	5831159	The format of that show is going to look a little different.
5831339	5837046	We'll still talk about games, of course, but it's going to be a lot more self-referential, so we look back on 23 years plus of the show.
5837026	5846977	If you have ideas, things you'd like to see us do, I really invite you to join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord with anything you'd like to see us do for that final show within reason.
5847478	5848519	Get Reggie Fils-Aimé.
5848639	5850321	It's got to be things that are in reason.
5851182	5852143	But we look forward to that.
5853565	5854626	DarkSakura, I don't know.
5854666	5860513	You're probably not ready to talk about the successor yet, but maybe in a couple weeks you'll have some more information on that.
5861354	5864738	We're working on a teaser.
5864887	5865508	Oh, cool.
5866209	5867771	I think we've settled on the name.
5868111	5869152	We're getting everything together.
5869272	5870434	Even I don't know what that is.
5871135	5871235	Okay.
5871775	5891099	I personally need a little... I need some buffer time because this is... I'm not going to go too far into it, but it's very triggering for my... There's a condition called alexithymia where you feel so many things that you don't know what you're feeling.
5891640	5891780	Mm-hmm.
5891800	5891940	Mm-hmm.
5892832	5894454	Yeah, I hear you.
5894815	5905890	I'm going to take the rest of the year off before I even think about video creation or whatever I might want to do that's a different sort of time commitment in the future.
5906371	5909415	But right now, I think from this year, I'm just so exhausted.
5909475	5910837	I'm just like, I'm going to take the rest of the year off.
5911157	5911958	That's where I'm at.
5911978	5915463	So I don't blame you if you wait a few weeks or whatever you're going to do.
5916144	5918768	But I'm excited to hear more about it.
5918788	5919769	All right.
5919789	5921151	We're hanging out on Thursday.
5922565	5924247	Hey, everyone, be jealous.
5924287	5925148	We're going to see Clue.
5925909	5926209	We are.
5926229	5928271	We're going to go see Clue on the big screen on Thursday.
5928772	5932916	Randomly, the Crest Theater here started showing, like, oh, they were doing, like, Labyrinth last week.
5932936	5934478	They showed cool old movies.
5934498	5936981	I was at ballet class, so I couldn't go to that one.
5937101	5940845	But they did Adam's Family Values, I think.
5940865	5941005	Mm-hmm.
5941025	5944449	But... But... But, yeah.
5945029	5945670	And...
5947895	5950539	There's a little talk about the alexithymia.
5950659	5954083	For me, it's a comorbid with autism, so it's just a normal thing for me.
5954744	5957167	Anyway, flames!
5957187	5959050	Flames on the side of my face.
5959591	5963496	Let me get to some of these calls real quick, because we actually have a couple people in the green room.
5963516	5965919	I want to get to them, so we will bring some folks on.
5966259	5966820	I guess.
5967080	5968522	Alright, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5968542	5968923	Who's this?
5973910	5974330	Hello.
5974350	5976153	You called on me first?
5976173	5977294	Yeah, is that okay?
5977780	5981404	Oh, I mean, it's fine, but I think there was someone else in the green room.
5981584	5989754	Oh, I just looked and I saw both you and I pulled... Well, you both get your turn, so what's up?
5989774	5994159	Well, actually, I called in because... Oh, first of all, hi, it's Aaron.
5994659	5994779	Hi.
5996922	5997502	Hi, Flynn.
5998323	5998724	Hello.
6000105	6000866	Hello, LR.
6003509	6006893	I was actually thinking of emailing just to say hello, LR.
6007328	6017305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6017639	6046178	AJ called in asking about DDR tournaments and I figured I would go ahead and let you know that DDR tournaments are still a thing that is happening quite regularly in fact and I myself against my better judgment have decided to jump in and enter one yeah this coming February in Pennsylvania and
6046613	6055459	and yeah, looking forward to it and I wanted to go ahead and let you know what a modern DDR tournament looks like.
6057397	6058018	Yes, please.
6058058	6063963	Sorry, my cameras are all messed up and I don't know why, but we're going to adjust that on the fly while you tell us about tournaments.
6063983	6069888	Because yes, I can't believe I didn't think to talk about that tournaments are still a thing.
6070409	6072110	Because I judged one a few years ago.
6072150	6073531	It wasn't that long ago I judged one.
6073551	6076294	It was called Freestyle Takeover or something like that.
6076374	6079717	And I know they were setting it up to keep it going, but I don't know.
6080117	6082740	So I was trying to look up the current status of that here on the West Coast.
6082760	6084321	But yes, they're still going.
6084341	6086543	So tell us about what's going on in your part of the country.
6087434	6095268	Yeah, so actually this is a pretty common format that a lot of the larger tournaments are using.
6095688	6103302	Unfortunately, you don't see much in the way of freestyle tournaments anymore, but what you do see is this sort of format that this is.
6103322	6109813	It's obviously accuracy-based, of course, but...
6109793	6122570	They've solved a lot of the issues of the past, like, you know, a whole bunch of people entering, you play a match and then you have to wait like six hours or until the next day for your next match.
6123732	6129339	And, you know, possibly getting destroyed in one match and you're done.
6130721	6139733	But yeah, a lot of these issues have been fixed by the current format, which is referred to as Waterfall Gauntlet.
6140320	6147387	I've also seen Waterfall Round Robin, but this Waterfall format is pretty popular.
6147407	6160140	And basically what that is, like if you were to play classic Mortal Kombat, you know how when you start the game it shows, okay, here's the battle plan, and it shows you the ladder that you have to climb up.
6160861	6166547	Well, basically think of that ladder as a series of player pools.
6167033	6174945	And based on your performance in the qualifier, which actually happens in the months leading up to the tournament.
6174965	6178110	And you basically play the qualifier whenever you want.
6178150	6181335	You can submit as many tries as you want.
6181355	6187063	And it's basically your best score on a number of songs that you submit screenshots of.
6187083	6196197	And then depending on your rank in the qualifier, you're seeded into a pool somewhere on some rung of this ladder.
6196177	6215434	and then the way it works is the bottom pool is and all the pools are like four to six players so the bottom pool runs first and generally either you have a round robin format where everyone plays against everyone else and you see who gets the most wins
6215701	6245168	or you have a gauntlet format which is what I'm doing where everyone plays the same set of five songs in my case and highest EX score is what you're competing for and then the top two players I keep forgetting EX score is like a standard now I keep forgetting that that kind of switched a few years ago it makes a much bigger difference now because the skill level of the players is so much higher
6245148	6249955	You want there to be a bigger difference in score between Marvelous and Perfect.
6250535	6255062	And that's what you get with EX score, with Marvelous being worth 3 and Perfect worth 2.
6255582	6264535	As opposed to the regular scoring system where Marv and Perfect are basically the same and then Grade is far lower.
6265176	6265977	But anyway, yes.
6265997	6268320	So generally what you have is...
6268300	6276337	You compete with the players in your pool and the top two move on to the next pool and everyone else is out.
6277460	6282310	And then, you know, basically you can fight your way up so long as you keep
6283117	6308770	you know dominating your pool and then you're eliminated but what's nice about this format is you play your matches and then you you know if you do well you continue playing and then you're not waiting around until the next day or five hours or whatever for your next matches if you're you know if you keep going you play imminently you're when you're out you're out
6308969	6326387	and so on.
6326367	6346941	and if you're seated you know maybe not where you should have been in the qualifier you have the opportunity to move up the ladder which I mean it's exciting to watch and to do of course so yeah it's something I'm very much looking forward to I haven't competed in a DDR tournament in
6346921	6372152	You go show them kids.
6373229	6374071	Something like that.
6374091	6375373	I'm going to show them something.
6375994	6379600	It might be something laughable, but it will be something indeed.
6380963	6384830	But I am planning to do the birthday challenge again.
6386012	6392183	So if you're really bored, I'm not doing it next weekend because I'm going to be traveling, but probably the weekend after that.
6392163	6411015	if you want to see me play Max 346 times I'll be there it probably is going to be earlier in the day perhaps the same day as the final episode of this show so yeah have fun if you want to watch that
6411282	6415415	Well, YYR, thank you, of course, for calling in.
6415515	6417782	I got to let you go so we get to, as you know, somebody else is waiting.
6417802	6422777	We have a couple emails as well, but anything else you want to let off before you go?
6423905	6430393	I'm sorry that I couldn't get the new version of Bungie Ferret Tossing ready in time for this.
6430733	6431975	Don't apologize for that.
6431995	6432636	Focus on that.
6433617	6435139	It is what it is.
6435399	6437742	Also, remember, we're not dying.
6437762	6438463	I will still be.
6438543	6443449	If you decide to re-release Bungie Ferret Tossing at some point, I'll still love to play it and hype it where I can.
6445691	6447674	There'll be another avenue.
6447694	6448815	Mm-hmm.
6449791	6450232	Indeed.
6450472	6452214	Yes, I will be in touch.
6453255	6460243	This will probably be my last call-in, so thank you again for the show, and be well.
6460283	6460704	Have fun.
6460844	6461404	You're welcome.
6461464	6462165	Thank you once again.
6462185	6465049	I know we got into this last time, but thanks so much for all your support over the years.
6465089	6465990	It really does mean the world.
6467011	6468553	And thank you for the thing.
6468573	6468893	All right.
6468993	6469654	Take care, YYR.
6470054	6470555	Until next time.
6470735	6471296	See you later.
6471496	6471696	All right.
6471776	6472778	Bye.
6472798	6473118	Bye-bye.
6473578	6474019	All right.
6474039	6476862	Let's get Rama in here.
6476902	6477503	Hi.
6480082	6481546	Hi, hi, hi.
6482008	6483031	Hey, what's up?
6486261	6490293	Okay, I had two things I wanted to say, but now I have three things.
6490313	6491758	I have to thank YYR for that.
6492059	6492400	Okay.
6493323	6493804	Uh-oh.
6494307	6504007	No, when you talk about the DDR tournaments, I can more or less vouch for that because as I mentioned before, I have also a friend named Matt.
6504087	6510540	I come to the realization almost every person I know named Matt has a DDR machine in their house, you know?
6510560	6511683	You know?
6511703	6511843	Mm-hmm.
6512093	6526570	and I went over to his house you know he's having his party and him and his girl were talking about DDR in tournaments and I'm asking them what they're doing and they're like they have to submit their scores online to compete and I'm just like scratching my head that's a thing now?
6527311	6541307	I didn't go into details about it but when I'm hearing YYR talk about that I'm like yeah that make it's like the light switch went on you know yeah yeah and you said you had a friend that was at a tournament today
6541591	6542333	This weekend, yeah.
6542353	6545581	And he just had another one like a couple of weekends ago, too.
6546162	6550933	And if it makes you feel any better, it's within our age range.
6551154	6556968	And let's just say, oh, he can play.
6556988	6557349	Okay.
6557589	6558351	All right.
6559681	6563226	Now, you mentioned Food Network earlier.
6563887	6584897	Then don't I. I'm on the bus coming home, and I just had to internally laugh because I'm at that age where we go to the conventions, we get into the room, after we've done our day thing or whatever, normally we would just hook up the fire stick, have some YouTube playing, chill drinks on the side.
6585558	6587781	Now, we come into the room,
6588487	6595680	Turn on Food Network, and we just sit there and watch Diners, Drives, and Dies for the next three hours, okay?
6597143	6598766	Good times.
6598786	6600128	Yes, good times.
6600569	6601130	Oh my gosh.
6601350	6605858	You know, I didn't mention this earlier in the show, but I went to a convention of sorts today.
6605939	6606600	It was a little different.
6606620	6609685	It's something called the Oddities and Curiosities Expo is here in town.
6610507	6612250	I've heard of that, yes.
6612230	6623146	So what it is, it's kind of like the vendor hall at an anime convention, but instead of it being anime waifu merchandise, it's like Baphomet, Elvira, and Kittens Summoning Demons.
6623346	6625590	Like it's like all those sorts of... It's taxidermy.
6626091	6628134	So it's all sorts of like odd little things.
6628154	6635164	But of course I ran into like multiple people I knew there just because of, you know, the circles I run in here locally.
6635184	6636766	But it was fun.
6636786	6638008	I didn't end up buying anything though.
6638028	6639250	I was kind of... I just...
6639230	6641132	I didn't see anything that was like, oh, I got to have it.
6641153	6650264	There was an artist and I wish I'd gotten their business card because it was a really good Frankenfurter from Rocky Horror portrait with like snapping the pink glove.
6650645	6658635	And it looked like the way it was like the big eyes, like it looked like a Frankenstein from the 30s kind of poster that I really kind of liked.
6659016	6662200	So I wish I'd gotten that artist's info, but oh well.
6662180	6663381	You know what you do?
6663641	6666164	See if they have a Facebook page or a group.
6666704	6668146	Join it and ask.
6668566	6669347	Somebody will know.
6669767	6674271	I've seen that a few times where, oh, I missed this booth or this booth had this.
6674532	6675312	Do you know who it was?
6675733	6676574	Somebody has it.
6676594	6677354	Drew, you know what?
6677374	6685022	Now that you say that, I know that that account has an Instagram with stories and they post what people – and you'll see all these booths that are tagged.
6685042	6687184	So I should just see if the individual's booth was tagged.
6687384	6688245	That's actually a really good idea.
6688865	6689706	All right.
6689686	6692333	Anyway, what did you actually want to talk to us about tonight, Ranma?
6693115	6696725	I wanted to talk about the whole AI thing of Square Enix for a second.
6697166	6704326	And for this, I also want to thank you because of something you said about Blue Sky that came in handy last week.
6704346	6705248	Okay, I'm curious.
6705228	6707230	I understand AI.
6707250	6708312	Again, I'm in IT.
6708412	6709613	I see both sides of it.
6709733	6712176	Some of it I'm for, some of it not so much.
6712737	6717122	And I understand how AI can make your job better, can make your job worse.
6717342	6719765	It can make you lose your job.
6719785	6721787	I get all of it.
6721807	6729215	Somebody on Blue Sky was talking about AI and how it's taking away all these jobs left and right for everything that's being done.
6729636	6734121	Now, before I jump in and say something, I have to read and see what's going on.
6734607	6738472	and I've had to explain to people there are various types of AI out there.
6738712	6740414	Then again, it's not even real AI.
6740514	6749585	I mean, what we call AI, I say it's a fancier version of Cortana or Siri, if you ask me personally.
6749605	6750847	No, you're absolutely correct.
6750867	6753730	We don't have anything that's yet passed the Turing test.
6753750	6754130	Thank you.
6755893	6762601	Now, this topic of AI came up on this person's feed and we're starting to have a conversation about it.
6762821	6764563	And I told her,
6764662	6767328	Generative AI is the problem.
6768129	6768911	That's the problem.
6770314	6774102	Narrow AI or assistive AI is the good thing.
6774122	6780055	And I'm explaining to her how there are video games and software and application that has AI in it to help.
6780075	6782620	And it's part of, sometimes it's actually part of the code.
6783123	6812050	so instead of her complimenting me back oh she quote what I said and got on her soapbox about things I said nope remove quote mute nope I am not having that best best part of Blue Sky I realize Blue Sky is missing a lot but that is one thing that the old place did not have that is so handy is that when somebody tries to quote you to dunk on you not fuck that I'm sorry if you have to quote dunk me
6812030	6813032	You're weak.
6813052	6814054	Your family is weak.
6814214	6815336	Your lineage is weak.
6815917	6816818	Dishonor on you.
6817139	6818161	Dishonor on your cow.
6818421	6819523	Dishonor on your family.
6819543	6820926	Yes.
6820946	6825654	Now, AI and Square Enix and QA, in a way, I get it.
6825674	6830983	Because when you think about it, if the QA-ers are looking for like...
6831773	6832694	100 things.
6833275	6837080	And maybe 20 or 30 of those things are the same thing in different games.
6837200	6846252	I can see AI going in and automating that and then doing a quick check to see if that has been done, you know?
6846733	6848715	That part I do understand.
6848976	6852921	I understand like it's going to be 70%, you know?
6852901	6858216	I'm just saying, I get and I understand Square Enix's reasoning behind it.
6858797	6860943	Games will come out quicker and so forth.
6861324	6865155	But on the downside, some people will lose their jobs.
6865928	6871835	And in some cases, whoever is left, their jobs will be a little bit easier, less mind-numbing.
6872376	6872757	Who knows?
6872777	6874999	They might even get a bump in pay.
6875880	6881467	It's really up to the business culture to define is AI going to be a tool or is it going to be a replacement?
6881868	6891480	And I would hope that in a few years' time, you're going to see those companies where AI is a tool are going to outperform those where AI is a replacement.
6892355	6898874	Yeah, I mean, because when I hear about it, and I'm reading about it, I'm like, I see it's more of a tool.
6899295	6907157	But the problem is, when you mention AI, 100% of the people that are against it
6908470	6911354	Guns blazing, shoot everybody.
6911374	6911855	Maybe.
6911975	6913016	It's more nuanced than that.
6913176	6914638	It is way more nuanced.
6914999	6920166	It's because the label AI is being used too much.
6920506	6921688	That's the problem.
6921748	6930600	So it's causing people to have that Pavlovian response to it when it's really, it's the generative AI that is the part that, you know, and how it's generating.
6930900	6936027	You know, I would even go so far as to say it's not all generative AI is bad depending on how it's being trained.
6936047	6937810	That's the key part.
6938090	6938190	Yeah.
6938170	6952095	and then it's like those who kind of know the difference will be up in arms and then when someone in the tech, graphic, scientific field tries to simplify it
6952379	6954422	They look at you like, oh, you're pro AI.
6954442	6954903	But no.
6955524	6956926	Trying to educate you.
6956986	6962594	Photoshop hasn't done a damn thing different in the last 20 years, except now they're calling it AI.
6962674	6966099	With an exception, actually, Adobe does have a generative picture thing.
6967181	6972909	From Adobe's standpoint, I happen to know that they are saying it's trained on their own stuff.
6972929	6974712	Adobe does not train on stuff outside.
6974752	6976374	I don't work for them or anything.
6976755	6978497	I'm in the loop of some of their updates.
6978517	6979078	Well,
6979058	6982402	don't they train on people that don't opt out of stuff?
6984265	7007614	I don't know if you put it in creative cloud but if you sign out of it, they won't touch your stuff I'm not here to defend them, what I'm here to say is that for the most part, outside of those tools that actually do the generate me a picture of a bird kissing another bird, whatever you're into then that all the other tools are the same fucking things they've been doing for years except now they just call it AI
7008235	7011720	and I'll say this one part and I get out here so you can do emails and all of that.
7012020	7026741	It's gotten to the point where I forget the organization but there's like 16 different Japanese companies and organizations that are basically pushing back against it and passing legislation saying it's copyright infringement right off the bat.
7027342	7029325	Yeah, there's been a lot of interesting development there.
7030266	7031728	The funny thing is
7031708	7039639	You probably would not have heard about this happening if Jareth AI didn't start doing graphics that looked like something that came out of a Ghibli movie.
7040721	7042543	Which that filter was all the rage.
7042563	7045647	But anyone, of course, with the trained eye would be able to tell that it's fake.
7045668	7052457	Well, and all the most mediocre people you know on Facebook were running that filter on their pictures for a hot minute.
7054340	7056062	Jamie, let me say this.
7057190	7076312	DarkSakura.com
7076292	7095094	look for any anime AI image and find a picture of Gadget you will see resemblance you can get 20 different anime images that was AI rendered put a picture of Gadget right next to it and if you look at her face you will see the similarities across the board amazing
7095361	7100248	I have run across some that look very realistic, but I get your point.
7101009	7109682	I'm also going to say, though, that for anyone who is a trained artist, you're also going to find anatomical inconsistencies, shading, lighting.
7110523	7114108	You will find where a finger doesn't connect to the rest of the body.
7115250	7116772	There will always be an error.
7117433	7120197	The lines in the artwork may be clean, but wait, hold up.
7120217	7122540	Those lines are a little bit too clean.
7122781	7122921	Mm-hmm.
7123981	7131034	It's not even necessary that I can do artwork, run it back through Pixelmator or what have you, and have my lines be super clean.
7131775	7135662	It's the issue that there'll be proportion issues.
7135682	7140611	There'll be a hand that doesn't quite go the right way, a leg that's turned in an unnatural way.
7140851	7144538	There's always going to be something that tells that this is not real.
7145345	7149470	Alright, well, Ranma, this is a debate that's going to continue for a long time.
7149510	7151352	But anyway, Ranma, thank you so much for your call.
7151372	7152774	We always appreciate hearing from you.
7153034	7159903	And if the listeners want to hear more of you, which I hope they do, they'll tune in to you and your pals on Anime Jam Session.
7160003	7162666	Which, you still have a few shows before your holiday break.
7162686	7165830	Yeah, your holiday break's not for a few weeks.
7165850	7166350	Alright.
7168152	7171617	We did announce that it's you, me, and Brad, too, with our Endeavor.
7172818	7174440	I totally... When, tonight?
7175450	7182120	I think we did a week or so ago, but I think that... I actually don't think that was announced, but maybe you want to say something about that?
7183783	7184143	Oops!
7184163	7185485	Oh, Luke-chan!
7186206	7187108	Breaking news.
7189391	7190753	I thought I said something, I'm sorry.
7191975	7195380	Well... Meow.
7196281	7198865	There's a cat running around, somebody's let it out of a bag.
7199887	7200748	Look over there!
7202028	7205472	I guess that means I have to go edit that project one more time.
7208195	7209296	I'm sorry.
7210417	7210978	It's funny.
7211098	7211699	We still love you.
7211759	7212439	Come on now.
7213561	7214482	But I'm very happy.
7214782	7218506	And we will leave it as that teaser until later.
7218526	7218806	Alright.
7220888	7221409	Take care, Ranma.
7221529	7222270	Always good to hear from you.
7222670	7224933	And apparently we're going to hear a lot more from you.
7227075	7227816	Take care, buddy.
7229011	7229351	All right.
7230653	7231834	Love it.
7231914	7232595	Let's get to emails.
7232815	7235659	I feel kind of bad now, but I thought I had said something already.
7235679	7236019	I'm sorry.
7236840	7237300	Why?
7237321	7238222	So you said it now.
7238442	7238922	Who cares?
7239002	7239443	It's funny.
7239843	7240164	All right.
7241525	7241866	All right.
7242406	7242807	Emails.
7244128	7244389	All right.
7244469	7245290	First email.
7245470	7247452	This comes from DarkTetsuya.
7248513	7249575	The sound of goodbye.
7251096	7256823	And I am angry at you right now, sir, because that song's been stuck in my head ever since I saw your email.
7257103	7258765	But what a good song to have stuck in your head.
7258812	7263317	It is a good song, but still, I'd like... I mean, it did replace the final countdown, so there's that.
7264578	7265119	So, anyway.
7266681	7268102	Hey, what's up, OLR?
7268122	7269484	Well, I can't believe this is it.
7269504	7273268	23 years of Sunday nights all coming to an end, of course, for me.
7273909	7275991	I'd known you all since sometime in 2000, 2001.
7276331	7284941	A chance encountered a local Bimani party when I discovered y'all were like-minded nerds as far as Konami's note-smashing stuff is concerned.
7286142	7286743	Um...
7287297	7314756	but fast forward to that fateful summer in 2002 after launching the live 365 stream of Bimani Dance Mania and other sort of rhythm game music there was the debut of the Sunday Night Show and it was probably taboo to talk about numbers but back then as I recall we had all of 12 live listeners and of course I was one of the lucky ones also I agree Shane was right about the early episodes bringing that Bimani Party all night energy to the podcast what a hell of a time
7314736	7326759	Covering the Solo 2000 controversy with the supposedly risque background animations and that crowd overreacting the way they tend to do, plus the first break that we ever took to Vanessa May's Destiny.
7326899	7328322	It was a night I would never forget.
7329945	7338060	There was for a time also the website component, which I don't know if folks knew you used to take submissions.
7338040	7346652	It seems like I had the record for the most submissions, so imagine my surprise when I got the message, Hey, you want to help us backstage with stories and stuff?
7346672	7349575	You've submitted so many, we thought we'd just let you do that on your own.
7349996	7355784	And I was invited backstage to help pitch in, which would continue to go through the rest of the run, speaking of which.
7355804	7367980	Then we eventually moved onto the podcast, first with the extra to-go episodes, and then about a year of that merged the two shows for the rest of its run.
7369158	7387538	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7388395	7396106	Of course, there are the other side projects I helped with to accompany the show, such as the Wikia, which we did come too close to comfort for losing.
7396646	7403456	Eternal gratitude for Bobby Blackwolf with his help in getting it restored, and to keep a record of all our shows both past and present.
7403476	7406600	Also, the OL Archive, the official archive for our oldest shows.
7406720	7408783	Did y'all know 100...
7409152	7410014	I say 100.
7410055	7417014	Y'all know one of our former fans, Jaded, hooked me up with the most original 1.0 run of Guys on a Show.
7417135	7419702	So if anyone wanted to hear that, it's there for your listening pleasure.
7420542	7425391	In closing, I know a lot of us grew, changed, graduated, got married, had families, and so on.
7425711	7433625	I know I met my wife, a friend of a friend of one of the OGs, TSS Tech Angel.
7433765	7435168	I can say words.
7435188	7437913	So it is no small thing to say the show changed my life forever.
7437953	7440998	Thank you for the most amazing thing I've been a part of.
7440978	7454076	but it has been a part of my life for over two decades I always said to myself what would I even do on Sundays anymore after they're over it definitely won't be the same thank you all for changing my Sunday night forever
7456098	7458602	Well, thank you for that, Dr. Tutsuya.
7458742	7462948	I know this show has meant a lot to you, almost as much as it has to us over the years.
7462968	7466913	And, you know, everything you said in there about getting invited backstage, true.
7467254	7476587	Because there was actually, it was funny, there was a point, I know you were invited backstage before that, but we had to shut down the forums at VOG Network just because of spammers and
7476567	7480916	The forum software is just generally old technology, right?
7480936	7482339	A lot of it is open to vulnerabilities.
7482619	7483962	I'm oversimplifying it.
7483982	7486768	So discords kind of became internet forums at some point.
7486848	7489213	One could argue there's still Reddit and things like that.
7489233	7494103	But for the most part, a lot of forum type chatter went over to something like a discord at some point.
7494083	7522960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7522940	7541573	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7541553	7545699	I think for the most part, I would say like 95% of people did get that change.
7546040	7550146	And I just wish other people would have realized we were always still talking about other games.
7550206	7554853	You go back in those shows and we're talking about like Dreamcast games playing to Jamie's and things like that.
7554873	7557117	And it's like, we were always talking about all games.
7557137	7560963	It's just, you know, we kind of made that switch a little more official.
7561083	7564448	But anyway, quite the retrospective there.
7564829	7566311	Or should I say retrospective song?
7566611	7568815	We're going to keep the Bomani song title names.
7569696	7570277	Anyway.
7572164	7573906	All right.
7573926	7574627	We have one more email.
7575288	7575748	Let's do it.
7577530	7578411	Hi, OLR.
7578512	7579613	It's your girl Mishi here.
7579733	7587482	I just wanted to express my gratitude toward you all and the members of this show because without you guys, I never would have met my best friend and partner, Dark Tetsuya.
7588143	7590486	Thank you for the memories and the wonderful show.
7590606	7595752	I'll miss this on Sunday nights and I wish the OLR me the best in whatever you guys have planned for the future.
7596173	7596974	Thanks for the memories.
7597134	7598115	Have a great night, y'all.
7598135	7599717	Sincerely, Mishi, a.k.a.
7599837	7600618	Mishikins.
7601881	7622944	Thanks for watching!
7622924	7628756	It's easy for me to sit here and say, gross, barf, but it's really adorable.
7629497	7636972	And well, if I am going to say something sassy, Mish, you and D'Artistou make straight people tolerable.
7636992	7637794	I'll say that.
7639529	7641791	No, and also, I do mean authentically.
7641811	7642792	You two are adorable.
7643373	7659247	And if this show had any small part in that, which is wild for me to think that this show set up relationships, but even when I think about my own marriage, this show was a way for Alan to get to know me when we lived 100 miles apart.
7659307	7664292	So I recognize this show has enhanced or sparked some relationships out there.
7664452	7668996	And so, yeah, it's wild to think about, but...
7668976	7672580	All three of us did get married during the course of the show.
7672600	7677465	I mean, Dan and I just celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary.
7679728	7689719	And then you and Alan and Matt and Nellie, and you've had small ones who are not so small anymore.
7690500	7692522	And we have all had our collection of felines.
7693443	7693583	Mm-hmm.
7693715	7699561	Rest in Peace Shermie, and Maruko, and Mr. Smush, and Sanrio.
7701043	7703666	And what was your cat's name?
7703806	7705948	Oh, Stella.
7706769	7707090	Yeah.
7708711	7710313	Hearts to all of our pets.
7711575	7713337	But yeah.
7713797	7718322	And I've always wanted to...
7720462	7745018	I may play like a little bit aggro like as the you know the bitchy co-host type person but it's all you know I have nothing but but cinnamon roll level feelings for for everybody and um yeah yeah all right well cinnamon roll I want a cinnamon roll now um
7746128	7763142	um anyway Dan cinnamon rolls I think that's it for emails tonight right so that is it and um of course uh I'm gonna I'm gonna play polya because I have to play something light before bed
7763122	7769940	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email, which remember, there's only a couple weeks left to do that.
7769960	7771664	So we hope you will take advantage of that.
7772146	7779966	We will have, I always want to just say by default, I don't know why my brain, I almost caught myself saying the Skype line.
7779946	7781849	But we all know it's Discord.
7782089	7786936	Discord will be open all night on the final night.
7787336	7790341	And we have some other things we're going to do and play around and have a good time.
7791522	7794566	But yeah, I know it's hard.
7794667	7799013	And again, I'm torn because on one hand, I am apologetic.
7799073	7804300	I'm sorry that I'm sort of the starter to...
7804280	7806823	Say, hey, I want to tap the brakes on this.
7806843	7817938	But on the other hand, I also know that for myself and just my batteries and my just... I don't want to say my mental health, but in part it is that.
7817958	7829432	I have to make this decision that's very difficult to just allow myself to take some time to stop because I've been working nonstop every day for so long.
7829452	7833898	But that doesn't mean that I love you all any less, all of you.
7833878	7841286	It just means I am recognizing that I just have to put myself first, which is hard to do sometimes.
7841306	7845991	And it sometimes takes... Especially when that decision affects other people.
7846632	7847232	It does.
7847252	7848073	It does.
7848373	7849675	And that makes it harder.
7849695	7850015	Yeah.
7850596	7850796	Yeah.
7853799	7854039	Anyway.
7855041	7859245	You know, I'm trying to look at...
7859748	7879866	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7881500	7897264	Some stuff earlier, I'm really happy to hear who is also involved in that because like in particular, I think, well, number one, you have quite the Super Smash Brothers of VOG personalities over the years coming together, which I think is incredible.
7897284	7901871	And I'm really excited for Brad to have an outlet like that again as well, I think is also like...
7901851	7928820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7928800	7941614	Even if I scream at everybody in my DBD matches, I've got great people in my life who help me with that too, like Shay and Shadow, who have been in my chats a lot, and Brad and Mike and everybody.
7941714	7955088	A lot of OLR people supported me, and I really appreciate you being there with me for that venture and sticking with me even though I'm dating pigeons in games sometimes.
7955108	7956790	VOGtron, Matt.
7957711	7958031	Love it.
7958855	7966169	I think I'm going to go make a bean quesadilla so that I can not sniff.
7966329	7966950	Quesadilla.
7968914	7971860	Did I ever tell you the story about the case of beer?
7971880	7972521	I'm going to say this.
7972561	7973282	It's the last story.
7975567	7978412	There was a restaurant in Mobile, Alabama called El Chico.
7978452	7979254	It was our favorite.
7979274	7982179	We'd all have family meetups and everything there.
7982159	8006648	and we were there with my uncle's wife and her parents at the time and my grandma was running late and so like hey should I order for Juliet and like yeah she wants a quesadilla well I didn't know Juliet drank she thought grandma said a case of beer so there you go a case of beer
8006982	8007783	Actually, okay.
8007823	8009865	So sometimes I'll see, I like a quesadilla.
8010686	8017874	Have you ever, okay, but my new obsession in the late night Mexican food department, not just a quesadilla, but a quesaburria.
8018094	8019136	Have you had one of those?
8019836	8020577	What is this?
8021198	8021739	Oh my God.
8021879	8023761	It's like, I don't know what they do to it.
8023901	8026824	They soak it in consomme.
8026844	8028887	Like they soak it and they fry it.
8028907	8031990	And so it gives it like just extra fat on that.
8032230	8032651	Gasp.
8032811	8034333	It's so good.
8034353	8035774	It's so good.
8035794	8036415	Gasp.
8037053	8039415	Alright, I require Thursday.
8041037	8043919	I don't know where the fuck to get quesadillas in this town, but you know what?
8043959	8044640	We'll find something.
8045681	8046142	Everywhere.
8046162	8047443	I mean, a lot of places.
8047463	8054569	I was going to say, any hole-in-the-wall Mexican place is going to have it, but it was LA where I had it for the first time, and I fell in love.
8054910	8056391	So, yeah.
8056571	8060175	Okay, I'll have to see if my stomach can handle it, but let's make this happen.
8060235	8063398	Victoria and I had DoorDash Mexican food at like 1 in the morning.
8063438	8064078	It was incredible.
8064699	8064799	Okay.
8065150	8065811	Oh my God.
8065952	8066933	All right.
8066953	8067314	All right.
8067394	8067835	All right.
8068416	8077594	We got, we got bedtimes to happen and, and Pally is to play and shows to edit and, and, and, and give me your money.
8077814	8078035	All right.
8078055	8079497	I mean, la, la, la, la, la, la.
8079517	8081722	Then before I get your final thought, DarkSakura, I'll let you go.
8081822	8084627	Let me ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.
8086463	8087365	Great.
8087625	8090231	Then we'll get to DarkSakura, your final thought.
8090271	8096484	Actually, I guess I should say, you know, I usually end this show with saying, you know, something like, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend, help us spread the word.
8096504	8097707	That is all still true.
8098147	8102356	You know, especially I would say, tell somebody who used to listen to us to come back, please.
8102456	8103799	You got two nights left to do it.
8104280	8106565	Are we that podcast that someone used to know?
8106545	8109310	I mean, that's kind of how it goes for a lot of people.
8109671	8118526	Every week, I did what I promised I would do, even though it broke every fiber of my being, and I logged into X, and I made a post.
8118967	8121952	And there was somebody who replied the equivalent of OMG.
8122433	8125479	So it got, you know, we're trying to let people know.
8126420	8129806	And PodCulture says, spay and neuter your pets, also your neighbors.
8130007	8130207	Of course.
8131334	8133197	Your neighbor's pets or your neighbors?
8133257	8134479	Because I would say... Your neighbors.
8134559	8135480	All right.
8136021	8137303	And Petapossum.
8137744	8141709	But no, I will just say thank you for all of your support over the years.
8141729	8144874	As you all know by now, our last show is in two weeks.
8144894	8151624	And it's bittersweet, but we are so thankful to all of you that have kept this powered for 23 and a half years.
8151644	8156852	Because if you think about all the shows in the history of the internet...
8156832	8164329	All of the shows in the history of the internet, there are very few, very few on any topic that have gone this long.
8164750	8166354	Very few on any topic that has gone this long.
8166835	8172107	And in the world of video games, there is one that has gone this long.
8172087	8176492	and another one in Spain that took an entire year off, but that's neither here nor there.
8176512	8180175	But there's one that's gone this long consistently and that's this one.
8180195	8190466	So unfortunately it had to end someday, but you guys have made this a hell of a ride, a world record run, literally, here on this show.
8190506	8191427	So thank you for your support.
8192708	8194831	All right, DarkSakura, your final thought?
8200416	8200997	Give me a dollar.
8202260	8203322	Okay, what's your Venmo?
8203342	8204784	No, I'm just kidding.
8205165	8206427	And possums are awesome.
8206547	8210793	They eat ticks and other terrible things, and they are almost immune to rabies.
8212656	8213818	So, go pet a possum.
8214720	8215681	Alright, have a good stream, DarkSakura.
8215701	8216022	Actually, don't.
8216042	8218025	They'll just hiss at you.
8218045	8218526	Have a good stream.
8220128	8222151	Bye!
8222231	8223513	Loki, we're over to you.
8223553	8225196	What's your final thought for us tonight?
8225716	8236182	hopefully I'll have my modded series ready to go soon because I've been working on that for a while now keep tweaking things I think we're almost to a point where I can do it
8238153	8243203	My final thought is I went to a drag brunch today.
8243343	8247070	So a friend of a friend was in from out of town and my friend wanted me to meet him.
8247090	8250196	So we all went to drag brunch together and that was a lot of fun.
8250256	8251098	Very high energy.
8251158	8252621	The drag performers did very well.
8252641	8254805	I certainly have nothing negative to say in that department.
8254905	8261157	I will say sometimes you bachelorette party girls need to behave yourselves at those events, but...
8261137	8261998	It was fine.
8262018	8262659	The show was good.
8262699	8267784	And again, I think that just all goes to say, support your local artists.
8268265	8272029	I say this a lot when I'm hosting shows live, and I probably need to say it more here.
8272569	8284242	So if I can literally have final words as I am, you know, sunsetting this whole thing, support your local artists, drag performers, burlesque performers, dancers.
8284222	8290849	Local artists showing in art galleries, choirs and vocal groups, pole dance troupes, you name it.
8290869	8292591	There's all sorts of art out there.
8292671	8295935	There is something for you and there's somebody locally producing it.
8295975	8298277	So please support your local artists.
8299258	8301701	And with that, we're going to roll credits.
8302562	8305045	We'll see you next week for episode number 1069.
