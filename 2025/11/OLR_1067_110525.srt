1
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:17,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic DDR players quickly learned how prolific Naoki was with his many pseudonyms, but there was a strong list of others that made or were part of certified classics too.

2
00:00:17,542 --> 00:00:20,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Session musicians and vocalists, licensed producers, and so on.

3
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't aware until looking up credits just how diverse Mauro Farina was.

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,096
[SPEAKER_05]: From the Eurocheese of Boom Boom Dollar, to the utter bop that was MaxUS's exclusive You Leave Me Alone.

5
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:31,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace, you legend.

6
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,366
[SPEAKER_05]: May a true artist's art live forever.

7
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:41,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the last few weeks in gaming news.

8
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:43,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:53,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:53,063 --> 00:01:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight in November the 2nd of 2025 with episode number 1067 of our show.

12
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:10,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Off after a quick break last week and we're back again for our final month of episodes.

13
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:38,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Loki, how are you?

14
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:48,426
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't until I watched you or your video tonight, because we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

15
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:52,931
[SPEAKER_08]: That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

16
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:58,897
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do watch us live, sometimes there's little things going on on the video, such as Loki with games in the background.

17
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:05,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have the brand new Katamari game going behind you tonight, which I forgot came out because I was a little bit...

18
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:19,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at a work thing this week and then I went to Disneyland and so like my mind kind of wasn't on video game news quite honestly for most of the week so I like forgot there was a new Katamari that came out um so I'm very curious did you get to play it?

19
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:47,788
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:02:48,663 --> 00:02:50,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, my feet.

21
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:52,028
[SPEAKER_02]: My feet still hate me.

22
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,653
[SPEAKER_02]: The panel was great, and it's actually one of the better ones.

23
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:59,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though this is like the first year, even though I wanted to go to panels, I actually didn't go to any of them.

24
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.

25
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too busy with people.

26
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet up with a ton of DBD people, a lot of people I know in person.

27
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:25,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Trixie Mattel was out of drag at PEX on Thursday night.

28
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:34,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but I got to, it was, it was packed like sardine in there, like just so, so many people, but I got to run into a lot of my friends.

29
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:41,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the drag show on Friday and, um, I actually was glad that I got in a day early.

30
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:42,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I had it in my head.

31
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:52,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna drive down Thursday and went Wednesday instead because I got, did my hotel room stupidly, but I'm glad I did because that extra day I could go pre-reg and then just chill and do whatever.

32
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

33
00:03:53,378 --> 00:04:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: um and then um and I tried not to really obligate myself to doing more than I wanted to like I was gonna do um the uh the other drag show the one that um Drag Trashly does oh and I'm not going um I actually skipped on a couple of things just because I wanted to chill um yeah we all need a people break now and then

34
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:19,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But the big day was Saturday.

35
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:27,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's so funny because now some of the people, especially at Stream Elements, there's a couple people there who recognize me now.

36
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

37
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to my Stream Elements friends.

38
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:42,690
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also went to the Horror Games Meetup, which was predominantly Dead by Daylight people and a bunch of people cosplaying.

39
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Allura Bliss, Tanis the Disco, Mikayla

40
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,545
[SPEAKER_02]: and just all kinds of people.

41
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:08,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a Fong and an Ace cosplayer.

42
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture of me sneaking up on them as Pig.

43
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

44
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so many awesome people.

45
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I met so many fun streamers.

46
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:24,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I connected with a few industry folks for...

47
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some promos and actually a gaming idea I might have for a fully blind accessible game that I have an idea for.

48
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say much more about it.

49
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:38,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just put it this way.

50
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:42,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to learn a lot more about haptics to implement my idea.

51
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:50,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving through that though, Sunday was just the chill day.

52
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the day I went around and just like

53
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I was Swag Day, actually.

54
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I just called it Swag Day because that's the day I just did everything.

55
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I won some stuff.

56
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

57
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun.

58
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:14,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just got a couple of some dice and a Jeff the Landshark U2s.

59
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:19,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Phasmophobia mug that I...

60
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:27,349
[SPEAKER_02]: may or may not be doing something with as a giveaway perhaps we'll see um

61
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:37,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, and then, uh, I went to a party Sunday night and, um, it was the, the, the big dead by daylight streamer meetup.

62
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:38,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It was packed.

63
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It was horrible.

64
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, not horrible.

65
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was great, but I didn't really go in and drink or do anything.

66
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:48,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hung outside with a couple of, uh, new, uh, new friends.

67
00:06:48,318 --> 00:06:49,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Horribly claustrophobic.

68
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

69
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was way too busy.

70
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:58,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go to this arcade that was across the street.

71
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:02,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you pay at the door and then it's free play for everything, although the crane games are pretty expensive.

72
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did win a chocolate cream Kirby.

73
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:09,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Random?

74
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:10,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

75
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:10,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cute.

76
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:14,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to find out where the crap I put themselves into a picture.

77
00:07:16,726 --> 00:07:24,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played a lot of classic games, which I mean, I guess I could transition a bit into my gaming two weeks.

78
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,943
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had a bunch of the Beimani stuff.

79
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:32,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a full official Guitarrera set up, but it was down to the count.

80
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:38,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look at my phone because you know me, whenever I go somewhere and play things, I take pictures of everything that I play.

81
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,419
[SPEAKER_02]: They did not have the para para this year.

82
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really disappointed at TwitchCon, but they had a bunch of other stuff.

83
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:45,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty neat.

84
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:52,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I think everyone fell in love with my cat because I show everybody pictures of Midna.

85
00:07:53,736 --> 00:08:01,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to, though, head back to be able to check into my hotel before midnight in Anaheim because I did go to Disneyland and

86
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:08,633
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did walk over 20,000 steps at Disneyland and murdered my feet.

87
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to go by Nick's place on the way back home to drop off something for him to give to a friend.

88
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:27,534
[SPEAKER_02]: And my direction started to take me to Barstow, so I had to turn back around a different way and went past some ghost towns.

89
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of interesting.

90
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:34,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And then went up 99 Circus Top at my favorite Bravo Farms.

91
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:35,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Does he still live in the North?

92
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:39,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously, I don't want to dox him, but does he still live in the North LA area?

93
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's general enough.

94
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,749
[SPEAKER_02]: He moved.

95
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:43,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

96
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

97
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:44,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that.

98
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:47,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know he moved, but I didn't think he moved far.

99
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:48,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's interesting.

100
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:48,947
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

101
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, still basic area.

102
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a little bit more.

103
00:08:54,451 --> 00:09:03,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, also, one of the booths at TwitchCon had like the big, you know, like the thing with all the pins and you push your hand through it, it makes a picture of your hand.

104
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one that says OLR.

105
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,995
[SPEAKER_08]: How Radio Shack of the 90s did.

106
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,437
[SPEAKER_08]: to have those pins.

107
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:11,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that where those would always be?

108
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:12,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Those little pin boards?

109
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:13,322
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fun though.

110
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,323
[SPEAKER_07]: They were there.

111
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,568
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would always think the large ones like the Exploratorium.

112
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:18,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Exploratorium.

113
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

114
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:20,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the big ones.

115
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:21,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I think that's where I first saw them.

116
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Spencer's, you're right, had those knockoffs for a long time.

117
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the neon ones.

118
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:27,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

119
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Classic, not real nails.

00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:58,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade Monsters Arcade Monsters Arcade Monsters

122
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:40,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter X Mega Man Poppin' Music Puyo Puyo Esports Pokken Tournament

[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeons and Dragons, Tower of Doom Tetris Plus I didn't really play that though They had the Sailor Moon Adventure game, I played that They had Zoltar, they had Contra Evolution I played Tank Tank Tank because I am always happy whenever I play Tank Tank Tank I haven't seen that game in years They had the Where's Waldo cabinet except it was Japanese one so it was Where's Wally They have a Where's Waldo game?

125
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the Nintendo game but oh wow I never knew that, that's crazy

126
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:48,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's lots of stuff, but I really just, I had fun meeting up with friends and hanging out and walking around and just doing.

127
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:58,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have to address the elephant in the room that SSJ100 Matt brought up about the security issue.

128
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a streamer who was attacked at her meet and greet.

129
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember her name because she's no one I follow.

130
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:11,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Emeru.

131
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Emeru.

132
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:42,784
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh she was um there for her meet and greet and then some person just rushes up on her and grabs her tries to kiss her the TwitchCon staff really didn't do much it was her own staff that pushed them off and got her away and she um she posted um

133
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:58,253
[SPEAKER_02]: that this person crossed multiple barriers at TwitchCon and got in front of other creators to meet her and basically negated what the Twitch official response was.

134
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:04,722
[SPEAKER_02]: She said it was a blatant lie and that her assailant was not immediately caught or detained.

135
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:11,596
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, this is a quote, he was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me.

136
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:18,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it and not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal.

137
00:13:20,294 --> 00:13:26,331
[SPEAKER_02]: and then her manager contacted the police and she's pressing charges.

138
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:34,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitch was going to suspend the guy for 30 days and then went to an indefinite ban after she pushed back.

139
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,058
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were

140
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:44,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying that, this is what they said, in line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident.

141
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:51,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We immediately bought this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events.

142
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:53,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, that is not how it happened.

143
00:13:55,073 --> 00:14:17,166
[SPEAKER_08]: um the video of the incident is really scary it was yeah around social media and it's one of those like you know that could have been a lot worse I mean not not that it was good don't get me wrong I'm not but it was like that could have been a lot worse like just I'm shocked at how he was really able to just walk right up to her essentially yeah it was wild to me

144
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:43,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and also I am trying to see if there was... Okay, so five days ago there is a post put out that Clancy, Dan Clancy, the CEO guy, he finally put out an official apology.

145
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:45,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Although like

146
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they put stuff on their freaking Twitter?

147
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:54,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Because why not do something that actually means something?

148
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:56,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll read what he said.

149
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,713
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't have happened, and we take that very seriously.

150
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We failed both in allowing it to occur and in our response following.

151
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,980
[SPEAKER_02]: We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made.

152
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize to Emeru for all that took place.

153
00:15:11,183 --> 00:15:13,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he went on and said some things himself.

154
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:39,482
[SPEAKER_02]: um the last thing on here you put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously um I'm gonna say this now I am not you know a big streamer I have my groups you know I have my people um I did not feel at all unsafe for myself I also am uh you know

155
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty vocal if someone steps to me.

156
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:48,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to very loudly say something about it and probably punch them, maybe.

157
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:58,129
[SPEAKER_02]: But all that aside, I do think that if you are a high-profile person in that situation...

158
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:12,979
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have the security detail, whether or not you are teeny tiny like Amaru, I'm saying physically, or a behemoth giant of a human being.

159
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,670
[SPEAKER_02]: You always need to have security detail.

160
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be stepped up.

161
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,436
[SPEAKER_02]: They started removing the ability to bring a friend in line with you.

162
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole plus one thing is gone.

163
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:33,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they're going to reinstate it next year, but even so, they need to step up their game.

164
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,471
[SPEAKER_02]: This was absolute mismanagement.

165
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:42,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I heard about it because I got a text from Sterlok, who, thank you for being concerned for...

166
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:52,328
[SPEAKER_02]: My well-being, but it wasn't like this was a big full-out someone ran into TwitchCon and tried to set it on fire or anything.

167
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,854
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an isolated thing for that day.

168
00:16:56,874 --> 00:16:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was nowhere near where it happened.

169
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:05,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, respectfully, I know you would be nowhere near that VIP area because that's just not how you roll on Twitch.

170
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:07,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about it.

171
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just fucking people.

172
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's...

173
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put it this way even if I was ever a biggest streamer is that I wouldn't want to fucking meet all those people I'll have a panel maybe and I'll just you know say some shit at a panel panels are fun oh yeah there's a thing about Emerus couldn't bring her chosen person because he got kicked out for touching somebody when he was trying to get them away from her

174
00:17:39,832 --> 00:17:41,334
[SPEAKER_07]: He got banned last year, I think.

175
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: But that says he was holding someone back.

176
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,257
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he didn't hold someone back.

177
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,561
[SPEAKER_07]: He detained somebody, essentially.

178
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was someone who was trying to attack his client.

179
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,527
[SPEAKER_02]: He was doing his job.

180
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:01,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're going to have to figure all that out because Emer is not the only one who's saying, I'm out for next year's TwitchCon.

181
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:03,096
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a ripple effect happening here.

182
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were already people out this year.

183
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:08,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I'd be very curious to see what the ripple effect is for next year.

184
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:15,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's still a lot of small to medium streamers that want to go meet their people, kind of like your story here.

185
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:25,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if some of this VIP culture element changes, but at the same time, one could argue the VIPs, even if we don't follow them personally...

186
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, they, they draw a lot of people in to the con.

187
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,656
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of people that go to meet the VIP people.

188
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:36,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so it's going to be interesting to see how Twitch sort of finds that balance for next year.

189
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:38,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.

190
00:18:38,287 --> 00:18:38,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

191
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:40,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

192
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,412
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's got to be secret.

193
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,196
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean...

194
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:55,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that one thing that I did not in person witness or hear anything about until after it had happened, I was fine.

195
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:56,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.

196
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed meeting all my people.

197
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:03,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get orange juice from an orange all over my shoe by poor Doc Martens.

198
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It really needed to be cleaned.

199
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:05,330
[SPEAKER_08]: It was in costume.

200
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought like an Orange Lounge radio fan gave you orange juice.

201
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:09,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that's where this was going.

202
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,478
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me sad.

203
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:10,898
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

204
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:14,383
[SPEAKER_02]: They were free oranges that were at the meet and greet rooms.

205
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:14,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks.

206
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:17,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go to the guild's meet and greets, so that was fun.

207
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into Funko Beard.

208
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I told Funko Beard he's officially my gunkle.

209
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,386
[SPEAKER_08]: What crappy affiliate giveaway did they give this year?

210
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:34,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember the last year I went was like keys for a mechanical keyboard that I'll never use in my life.

211
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:35,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't fucking remember.

212
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Would they give you a bookmark?

213
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,183
What?

214
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,308
[SPEAKER_02]: They have those little plastic bags again.

215
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little plastic things from last year.

216
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:48,960
[SPEAKER_02]: I, however, did get three Leon Kennedy blood splattered shirts.

217
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:50,402
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fun.

218
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:54,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And a copy of Just Dance 25 that I need to redeem.

219
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually kind of jealous of that.

220
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:59,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Savalos in chat says, I heard Orange Julius.

221
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:04,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, if an OLR fan wants to win my heart real fast, bring me a fucking Orange Julius.

222
00:20:04,823 --> 00:20:06,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

223
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:06,986
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be amazing.

224
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:07,407
Yeah.

225
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:13,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, not that that's going to happen anytime soon.

226
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:15,180
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be leaving a lot of widows after this month.

227
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:17,083
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

228
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:19,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

229
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:20,987
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to you in a little bit.

230
00:20:21,027 --> 00:20:22,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I did buy a bookmark.

231
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you buy a bookmark?

232
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I did buy a couple of bookmarks.

233
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:25,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

234
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,478
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're useful, but I just, you know, they're not particularly expensive.

235
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see my favorite dice vendor, too, so that was cool.

236
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:37,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought a candle.

237
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the candle, but it's Lemony.

238
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, what scent?

239
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from the same, it's the guy and his wife.

240
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,063
[SPEAKER_02]: She makes candles and he does the dice.

241
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there still like the whole like artist alley in the back sort of thing?

242
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:50,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's cute.

243
00:20:50,631 --> 00:20:52,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually bought the cutest hat.

244
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bucket hat, but it's black velour with a cat face on it and cat ears.

245
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed TwitchCon this year.

246
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:02,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I've just been a little bit out of the loop on Twitch culture.

247
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:07,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I lurk in people's channels, but I've been very not active in people's channels.

248
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:12,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I just feel like October, personally, I had a lot of stuff going on.

249
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a very, very big show that weekend.

250
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not going to be able to get to TwitchCon.

251
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,165
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the cards align next year, I would love to go back just because I like a lot of the community.

252
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:23,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I like a lot of the people that I see there.

253
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:40,270
[SPEAKER_08]: and plus if it's in San Diego it's not that far like I like that it's on the west coast I'm gonna lean into the west coast privilege thing a little bit because it was a lot easier to go than if it was like in New York I had the best drive I had the best drive really though my drive down was really smooth my drive back

254
00:21:40,250 --> 00:22:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

255
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a completely different aspect of it.

256
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,093
[SPEAKER_02]: These mountains did not look like the mountains that I remember.

257
00:22:06,895 --> 00:22:09,659
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I got past, I found myself a place to go pee.

258
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: You must have been in Lancaster or some shit, way out there.

259
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:12,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

260
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found my place to go pee, and then I rerouted my map, and it took me back.

261
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,994
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was only another hour-ish out of my way.

262
00:22:22,935 --> 00:22:29,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Dan loaned me his car refrigerator thing.

263
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:34,185
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an electric ice chest is kind of more what it's like.

264
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

265
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:41,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had, you know, I had, you know, nice cold snacks with me and my drinks were cold.

266
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:47,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I stopped at Bravo Farms to buy copious amounts of cheese, which I got cheese for you.

267
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:49,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember you texting me about that.

268
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone.

269
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, Savalas, I think I've beaten you now because I found pumpkin spice cheese and I bought it for Rob.

270
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:06,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have any Trader Joe's?

271
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:11,937
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, I have scaled way back on the pumpkin spice thing in recent years.

272
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,140
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

273
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like you had a good time.

274
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:19,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope the timing works out.

275
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to go back next year, but we'll see.

276
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I did also have I came back with fudge and Dan and I consumed it all.

277
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,278
[SPEAKER_02]: They had carrot cake flavor and I

278
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:31,401
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, me and Carrot Cake.

279
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I also find it funny that you and I were both at Disneyland separately, but like a week and a half apart.

280
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:41,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Like not that far apart, all things considered.

281
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:44,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we sent each other the same selfie, everyone.

282
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:44,959
[SPEAKER_08]: We did, we did.

283
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:50,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent Rob a picture of me on the teacups, and then Rob sent him on the teacups.

284
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:50,554
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

285
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:51,235
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

286
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew you'd appreciate it.

287
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,821
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

288
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:56,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a video game podcast.

289
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,866
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk about gaming news here once in a while.

290
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:04,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we were gone last week, again, I had a work thing that was mandatory for a few days.

291
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:05,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Mandatory fun.

292
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:06,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was actually...

293
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not just saying this because I know my boss listens to this show.

294
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

295
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:17,693
[SPEAKER_08]: But I actually did legit have a good time because we all work online and we work, you know, hybrid and at home and stuff.

296
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:22,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was really lovely to see a bunch of people in person and just kind of like get to do stuff for a few days.

297
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it was really lovely to just take an extra day and go to Disneyland, which I originally thought would be like a trip with coworkers.

298
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:32,032
[SPEAKER_08]: But then it kind of slowly became, oh, never mind.

299
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:33,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to stay a day.

300
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So I called Victoria and

301
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:45,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I kind of started to sense that, like, all right, I don't think many of my coworkers are going to go, I called Victoria and she was, of course, in like a flash.

302
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:56,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And then thanks to a very, very generous person out there, you know who you are, I was able to get into the parks for free, which I really, really appreciated and just able to, you know, just have a great day at the parks.

303
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:59,152
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah, kept me busy last week.

304
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:00,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

305
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:05,000
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't have a show on Sunday, but we missed a lot of gaming news.

306
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Loki, I would love for you to talk about one of the big headlines we missed last week.

307
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:12,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some small stuff happening in the world.

308
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

309
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:15,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we knew this was eventually going to happen.

310
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:23,205
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably thought it was going to happen a lot sooner than now because with all the multi-platform stuff coming out from Xbox, it's like...

311
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:28,472
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these days we're going to have Halo on PlayStation, and sure enough, now we do.

312
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Halo Campaign Evolved, which is a remake of the original Halo game in Unreal 5, and now it's going to be multi-platform.

313
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,555
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be on the Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 5.

314
00:25:44,695 --> 00:25:46,257
[SPEAKER_07]: But not Switch, too.

315
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:55,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Switch 2 because I don't think it has Switch 2 will be getting Halo Combat Evolved, the original Xbox game, and it will barely be able to run.

316
00:25:56,007 --> 00:25:57,429
[SPEAKER_02]: No great loss, it's just Halo.

317
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:06,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I do find it funny that more people are talking... Like, the fact that this is also on Xbox is being completely overlooked.

318
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:10,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like... Well, I shouldn't say completely, but majorly overlooked.

319
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:14,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, everybody's talking about, oh, this PS5 version is coming.

320
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,092
[SPEAKER_08]: The PS5 version of Halo is coming.

321
00:26:16,113 --> 00:26:18,876
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, you know it is going to be on the...

322
00:26:18,856 --> 00:26:39,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox Platform 2 but I just feel people are pivoting so fast to a world where maybe Xbox isn't a player anymore and maybe we'll talk more about that later but now it's talking about the PlayStation 5 I am not usually as big on the original Halo as I am like Halo 2 and maybe 3

323
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and what's interesting about it, it is the campaign.

324
00:26:58,063 --> 00:26:59,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have the multiplayer version.

325
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I missed that part.

326
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,430
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not even bothering to put in multiplayer?

327
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,093
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's no multiplayer.

328
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the campaign.

329
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:10,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Co-op for two players in split screen or up to four players online.

330
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Crossplay is supported, but it's not like the multiplayer.

331
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:14,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my thought on this.

332
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're doing the campaign as it's... They're going the Call of Duty route.

333
00:27:20,198 --> 00:27:25,347
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing the campaign as this, and then they're going to do a free-to-play...

334
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Why get $60 from you once when they can get it from you twice?

335
00:27:29,252 --> 00:27:30,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you think there'll be a free-to-play multiplayer?

336
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:39,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll be free-to-play, but it'll have microtransactions, passes out the wazoo, like Call of Duty.

337
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:41,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Or perks if you have Game Pass type of thing.

338
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:48,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see where maybe they don't want to cannibalize a multiplayer Halo thing they have coming next year.

339
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:49,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I think...

340
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

341
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:53,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

342
00:27:54,069 --> 00:28:06,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

343
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, still, what do we think?

344
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Cats and dogs living together in mass hysteria?

345
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:17,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, Halo... It's not as shocking anymore now that we've had so many games coming out.

346
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:22,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, like, you know, we've... I think we've long moved past this whole console war nonsense.

347
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:23,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Like...

348
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:24,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

349
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:25,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super with you actually.

350
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:26,856
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all just grown up.

351
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:31,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Forza and Sea of Thieves and the other things already coming to PlayStation.

352
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:32,265
[SPEAKER_08]: This was an inevitability.

353
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:33,186
[SPEAKER_08]: This was going to happen.

354
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:35,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Just imagine for a second.

355
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine for a second.

356
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:38,274
[SPEAKER_07]: We take consoles out of it.

357
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:44,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's update the whole dynamic to something that's more current.

358
00:28:44,183 --> 00:29:06,782
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

359
00:29:07,657 --> 00:29:36,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

360
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:44,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think the thing about this is that the optics is a little weird to me.

361
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:47,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the timing of this is not great.

362
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:52,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realize they didn't decide the week before when to announce this.

363
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:55,867
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of thought that goes into the rollout campaign and the when and all that.

364
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So I completely understand that.

365
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get that out of the way.

366
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:02,115
[SPEAKER_08]: But that being said, there's a lot of...

367
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:06,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox gut punch stories that have been happening over and over and over again.

368
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realized another one that came up the week we were gone.

369
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:11,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I didn't put this on the show world, but I have to bring this up.

370
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:14,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, I know you're going to know what I'm talking about the minute I start talking about it.

371
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:21,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the whole word that came out about that the Microsoft division is being forced to hit a 30% target.

372
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:41,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And that potentially this is what is actually driving some of the Game Pass increases and some of the things we see and that, in fact, it may even be playing into some of the hardware increases and not just the tariffs as originally thought, which is extremely problematic if that's like...

373
00:30:41,026 --> 00:30:45,153
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this arbitrary 30% that they're trying to hit on this front.

374
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:53,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've let us all believe that it's, you know, the tariffs, which, you know, I don't think you can say that's not to blame because you see it hitting PlayStation as well.

375
00:30:53,646 --> 00:31:02,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But there was an odd disconnect about it doesn't seem to be hitting PlayStation in the same volume or Nintendo even in the same volume that it's hitting Microsoft.

376
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we might have some insight why.

377
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is this whole that apparently there is this

378
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:12,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Arbitrary 30% profit margin, which by the way, is not common for the industry.

379
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually it's a 10 to 20% margin.

380
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:23,487
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like-

381
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:42,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not see Microsoft being a player in the hardware business in another year or two it is that dire with what's going on right now and I'm not saying that to be like an angry gamer I'm just saying real facts name a win for Microsoft in the last six months I'll wait

382
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:49,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm sure there's going to be an Xbox fan out there that's like, this game or that game.

383
00:31:49,835 --> 00:31:54,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, name a win that offsets the losses.

384
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:58,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Name a W that offsets the L's that Microsoft has been taking.

385
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:03,780
[SPEAKER_08]: And this whole 30% thing is just really not a good look.

386
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,625
[SPEAKER_08]: The optics of this is really shitty.

387
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:17,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And now to hear that Halo's going to PlayStation 5, I think there are so many people now that are just like, I never have to buy an Xbox again.

388
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:47,575
[SPEAKER_08]: and perhaps there's a part I think Microsoft sort of has to figure out what do you want to be and I think we're hearing most of the business say they are ready to pivot to games like every screen is an Xbox and not so much have a focus on hardware but then you get these things out of nowhere that are like oh but we're working on the next generation of Xbox we're committed to the next generation of Xbox that's going to happen or you know we're going to release this really expensive game

389
00:32:47,555 --> 00:32:53,164
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, handheld with a partner that, you know, probably doesn't even run as well as a Steam Deck.

390
00:32:53,224 --> 00:33:02,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you just, you find these weird ways that they're committing to hardware that are in conflict with that vision that is supposedly there.

391
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:09,630
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think a lot of decision makers at Microsoft need to sit down and answer two key questions.

392
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, are we all aligned?

393
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:19,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And number two, if we're not, who needs to get packing so we are?

394
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:25,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't see how Microsoft gets out of this mess without making some serious changes at the top.

395
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:30,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've kind of been hinting at this for a while, that Phil Spencer's time, I think, is about up.

396
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And I...

397
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe two years ago I would have said, I hate to say, now I say, it's a logical conclusion.

398
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:42,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just, it really isn't.

399
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:48,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, there's a whole, and you know, I don't think, the Phil Spencer was not the one that mandated that 30% margin either.

400
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:53,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember who the, I can't remember the woman's name who's ahead of, I don't remember what she's ahead of.

401
00:33:54,377 --> 00:33:57,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah, yeah.

402
00:33:57,643 --> 00:33:57,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

403
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:04,133
[SPEAKER_08]: None of them have had good takes on anything lately.

404
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:12,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Because she's in charge of software, I actually think she has the least amount to worry about right now.

405
00:34:12,185 --> 00:34:14,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the wins are all in software right now.

406
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,930
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where she's at.

407
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:23,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Even then, it's not really that much of a win.

408
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:27,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really been thinking too much about...

409
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:34,579
[SPEAKER_07]: The games that Microsoft's necessarily releasing, but there hasn't been a whole ton that have been like, oh my god, like, I need to run out and go get this right now.

410
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,345
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some that have been looking really good, but there's also games that, like, where's Fable?

411
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:41,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been waiting for that for years now, like, where's Fable?

412
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:47,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we were talking about brand new Fable back in the Kinect days, like, that's how long ago it's been.

413
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:50,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I don't know, it's...

414
00:34:51,113 --> 00:35:01,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby and Chat, Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes live before us on Sunday nights at VOG, is saying some things about this in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, saying the Microsoft CFO mandated it.

415
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:02,596
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not Sarah Bond.

416
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:03,598
[SPEAKER_08]: That's somebody else.

417
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:12,075
[SPEAKER_08]: But the CFO of Big Daddy Microsoft mandated the 30% profit margin, and the Xbox division, Phil and Sarah, have to do whatever they can to meet it.

418
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they're going all in on it.

419
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:27,448
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going...

420
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:35,197
[SPEAKER_07]: All in on AI over the main Microsoft area, which they're going to dump a ton of money into that, and that's going to flop.

421
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:36,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't wait to see that.

422
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:49,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand a lot of companies are navigating this whole AI thing, but I think those that are going as all in as they are, as fast as they are, are going to quickly find that you get what you pay for.

423
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,666
[SPEAKER_08]: and Microsoft may be one of the first to learn that.

424
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:56,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, and I'm kind of rooting for this to happen.

425
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to say it, but that's just where my head is at.

426
00:35:59,094 --> 00:36:08,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want Facebook to have disastrous financial outcomes because of everything they're doing.

427
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:09,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Facebook as a company has been

428
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:14,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a shithole for years and a blight on the internet.

429
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:19,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would love to see this type of investment sort of backfire on them, to be quite honest.

430
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,790
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway.

431
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Meta hasn't done anything exciting for a long time.

432
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:26,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the only thing that you can say is remotely exciting.

433
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Boomer memes.

434
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're into misinformation, boomer memes.

435
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:31,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

436
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:32,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook's where it's at.

437
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:38,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was going to say, like, their VR stuff was actually kind of neat.

438
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:39,513
[SPEAKER_07]: The hardware was.

439
00:36:39,693 --> 00:36:41,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Software, eh, I don't know.

440
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:46,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, where's my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas meta?

441
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:53,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were tooling that to be, like, first off, why you would even port that to VR in the first place, no idea.

442
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:57,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But, like, I thought they were working on that, and that certainly hasn't happened.

443
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,871
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, that was the only thing that was somewhat exciting.

444
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:02,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything else is just, eh, whatever.

445
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So several people in chat.

446
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:09,561
[SPEAKER_08]: QuestBuster saying Facebook lost roughly 10% from their AI unit.

447
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:09,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

448
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:15,206
[SPEAKER_08]: QuestBuster says Facebook lost roughly 10% in the past few days of their stock price.

449
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby says they laid off 600 from their AI units this week.

450
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,073
[SPEAKER_08]: QuestBuster says Facebook is so behind right now.

451
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:27,198
[SPEAKER_08]: SGO100Matt says it would be great if the American oligarchs got knocked down a few pegs.

452
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:28,760
[SPEAKER_08]: That fucking part.

453
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That fucking part.

454
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what it really is.

455
00:37:31,222 --> 00:37:32,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen anytime soon.

456
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,347
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but you... Here's the thing.

457
00:37:34,607 --> 00:37:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I second, third, fourth, and fifth, and sixth that.

458
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:44,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook could have leveraged AI to combat the massive amount of misinformation on the platform.

459
00:37:45,204 --> 00:37:49,130
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have leveraged... But they want the misinformation because more engagement, which means more ads.

460
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they don't care.

461
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:52,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about profit over ethics.

462
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:53,397
[SPEAKER_08]: You are 100% correct.

463
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,560
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point...

464
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:10,680
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

465
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:26,121
[SPEAKER_08]: and honestly at this point all I do is I cross post promotion yeah and anytime I find myself opening it at a muscle memory I have this add-on on my PC called FB Purity which forces the chronological meme without any of the fluff I used to use that

466
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:42,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thing is, you really quickly realize, like, if I were to scroll my feed, meme, meme, politics, meme, meme, politics, meme, misinformation, quote, it's just, there's literally, like, what the fuck ever happened to cat pics and lunch?

467
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:53,617
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time that I used Facebook was specifically to post a GoFundMe.

468
00:38:53,637 --> 00:39:05,433
[SPEAKER_08]: That being said, if I were to not use Facebook, a certain group of people that I know would have no idea what shows I'm ever hosting locally.

469
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:08,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I use it for promotion.

470
00:39:08,257 --> 00:39:10,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't type any personal insights on it anymore.

471
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:11,582
Okay.

472
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting the free ads from it.

473
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:18,679
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

474
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,103
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it's worth at this point to me.

475
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:23,166
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, I don't know.

476
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:26,311
[SPEAKER_08]: We got on a tangent from Microsoft to Facebook.

477
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:32,601
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, it does feel like a lot of that big tech bubble is going to burst.

478
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:37,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, how much of that is realistic thinking and how much of that is wishful thinking?

479
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will admit, both are coming into play.

480
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of it is the perspective.

481
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,552
[SPEAKER_07]: You look at, for example...

482
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:50,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Sora, like what is that platform even?

483
00:39:50,477 --> 00:40:00,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It is just a platform that people use AI to generate short videos of essentially trash, garbage stuff.

484
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a misinformation factory.

485
00:40:02,854 --> 00:40:05,258
[SPEAKER_08]: You are literally creating things that aren't real on it.

486
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:06,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right, right.

487
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what's the purpose of it though?

488
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how does that make that company money?

489
00:40:11,566 --> 00:40:12,808
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that make open AI money?

490
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, they want to serve ads.

491
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:35,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

492
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:38,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a viable company.

493
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:40,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not doing anything revolutionary.

494
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:44,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Why should we allow you to steal all of this IP?

495
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:53,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Just straight up, both them, Meta, everybody, just steal all the things just to generate slop.

496
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:56,241
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason for it.

497
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,214
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, anyway, we went down a rabbit hole, but that's fine.

498
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,476
[SPEAKER_08]: We have feelings.

499
00:41:02,516 --> 00:41:07,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week, Xbox or otherwise.

500
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,068
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, I have a feeling you are team otherwise.

501
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:11,270
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your gaming week?

502
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:22,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, apart from what I had already said for TwitchCon, I started Portal 2 last night as my retro game, which I feel kind of dirty calling it a retro game, but I literally have not played it in like 10 years.

503
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:23,629
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, yeah.

504
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:26,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So I played that.

505
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:31,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like up at puzzle 10 in the underground section.

506
00:41:32,177 --> 00:41:35,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got GLaDOS again, because she's a potato.

507
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I am still playing Dead by Daylight.

508
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I got all the way through the event, finally.

509
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,819
[SPEAKER_02]: My pig is P92.

510
00:41:50,997 --> 00:42:11,892
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

511
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:30,302
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:42:31,953 --> 00:42:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I really want to get through the DLC that I'm on before the new DLC comes out, which I have to see Fire and Ash first and then play the DLC.

513
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:53,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm frustrated by it because I do not want to play as Solek.

514
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's a cool character, don't get me wrong.

515
00:42:56,603 --> 00:43:01,909
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole reason I play Frontiers of Pandora is to play my character that I have...

516
00:43:01,889 --> 00:43:04,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Benwith from the beginning of the fucking game.

517
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

518
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:08,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ubisoft.

519
00:43:08,596 --> 00:43:13,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just hoping that if I get through the story part of it, then I can go back to playing my character.

520
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:19,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not super invested in Sleek.

521
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:20,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's a cool guy.

522
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:20,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool character.

523
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:24,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the comics.

524
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:26,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer my character.

525
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:27,795
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I play the damn game.

526
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I am less invested in playing a male character.

527
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:34,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Within reason.

528
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's Richter Belmont.

529
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Even.

530
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:42,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play Maria, actually.

531
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:43,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

532
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, if I'm playing Rondo, the game is freaking easy mode when you play Maria.

533
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:51,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus she has that little la la la la la la la.

534
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your game of the week?

535
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:55,876
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

536
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:57,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'll go over to Loki.

537
00:43:58,019 --> 00:43:58,660
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your game of the week?

538
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:12,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I mainly was working on Minecraft stuff, trying to get a modded... Still working on a modded series and trying to get the seed and the mods set up for that.

539
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I've gotten that.

540
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:17,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a seed I like and...

541
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:21,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working on trying to figure out how to get that all set up and started and stuff.

542
00:44:22,658 --> 00:44:23,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was that.

543
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:32,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Today I played through a Minecraft event that was Clix with InsideMC.

544
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:38,579
[SPEAKER_07]: They did an event with Clix Games that was kind of like MCC, so it's a bunch of different events.

545
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:40,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Our team actually ended up...

546
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:52,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one for points, and then we came in second for... Because basically the top two teams go to a final match where you fight each other, and then whoever wins that actually wins the whole thing.

547
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:54,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't win, but we came in first points-wise.

548
00:44:54,886 --> 00:44:56,709
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was a lot of fun.

549
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:56,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

550
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And we raised money for the Macmillan Cancer Fund Society.

551
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what it was.

552
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:04,843
Yeah.

553
00:45:05,397 --> 00:45:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Support, Cancer Support.

554
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:13,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was, I think, 1,900 pounds they raised.

555
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not bad.

556
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:21,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played this game that's behind me, which is Once Upon a Katamari.

557
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:26,011
[SPEAKER_07]: and I love me some Katamari, except I have some issues with this game.

558
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:33,444
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason for that is like, OK, so Katamari, when we first played, it was on a PlayStation two.

559
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:36,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It was basically, you know, not HD.

560
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:54,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

561
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:59,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is these games have been getting more and more elaborate as far as like the visuals go.

562
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:10,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And so playing this game, there's many times where the king of the cosmos will be sitting there talking to you and it blocks the entire center third of the screen.

563
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:39,512
[SPEAKER_07]: and so it's becoming now a problem with even though my screen resolution is going up these UI inner pieces are staying the same size it is taking up a massive amount of screen real estate and it is irritating because I cannot see what I'm doing in this game because there's too much UI that's unnecessary in there I think a good description I saw in the Steam reviews was the game lacks confidence in itself

564
00:46:39,492 --> 00:47:00,133
[SPEAKER_07]: and the reason they say that is because they're not confident in their soundtrack because they're selling the old soundtracks as DLC they're not confident that the players will be able to learn the controls from the tutorial so there's constant control prompts on the screen at all times they're not confident in

565
00:47:00,113 --> 00:47:28,804
[SPEAKER_07]: just going back to these levels again for replayability to like try to up your score so they hide these crowns in there which is fine that they have them but there's a lot of unnecessary menus there's a lot of unnecessary like hub worlds and stuff a lot of forcing you through like all these menus and customization like I don't care about customizing the Prince of the Cosmos I don't literally on like you can't really see it on the screen behind me right now but literally on that like the Prince is like

566
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:50,944
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe five pixels tall like you cannot see any sort of customization that you are doing on on your prints okay so in chat Bobby is saying that the king would interrupt on the PlayStation 2 game and it's a lot more to everything you're saying you could always pick from his cousins in the PS2 game too so yeah you can do that maybe not customize but it's you know changing it up you can

567
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:51,825
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do both.

568
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's constantly talking to you.

569
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,194
[SPEAKER_07]: He's doing it right now in this video that's behind me.

570
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:01,458
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just constantly talking and blocking a good portion of the screen.

571
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw some crown icons.

572
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:12,713
[SPEAKER_07]: These icons are coming right up over your... Yeah, there's icons and then there's power-ups that you get now, which also sit above your player as...

573
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So UI design is really bad.

574
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:23,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top of that, they have these unnecessary hub worlds that you go select your levels from.

575
00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:25,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It just feels really unnecessary.

576
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,300
[SPEAKER_07]: The other games did it so much better.

577
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:30,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to play a game where I'm rolling a Katamari around...

578
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:37,073
[SPEAKER_07]: We start off in a room and then, you know, at the very end of the game, we're rolling up the whole universe or whatever the case may be.

579
00:48:37,374 --> 00:48:38,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that's all I want.

580
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:39,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I want it simple.

581
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:43,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need all this, like, fluff and pizzazz and everything.

582
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:48,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a little annoying that they have, like, all this stuff in the way.

583
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,770
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, this is another thing where they do, like, a cutscene and it has a bunch of stuff in here.

584
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,533
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, is this really necessary?

585
00:48:55,553 --> 00:48:55,913
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

586
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a minor gripe.

587
00:48:58,153 --> 00:48:59,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's still an okay game.

588
00:48:59,495 --> 00:49:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a really great soundtrack.

589
00:49:01,778 --> 00:49:05,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks super crisp now with the new graphics and everything, so I really do like that.

590
00:49:06,165 --> 00:49:10,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But it also feels like it's just so sluggish to move around.

591
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:12,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it really is a slog sometimes.

592
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:19,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't quite feel as sharp or tight as I remember it was on the other consoles, but I don't know.

593
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

594
00:49:21,189 --> 00:49:21,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

595
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my gripes on it, but there are other people that agree with it, at least.

596
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:26,249
[SPEAKER_07]: How much was it?

597
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:27,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it a $70?

598
00:49:27,572 --> 00:49:29,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it still leaning into budget stuff?

599
00:49:29,878 --> 00:49:31,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so it's more like a $40, $50?

600
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:32,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember exactly.

601
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:37,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not super expensive, but it's... Bobby says $40.

602
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:38,659
[SPEAKER_07]: $40.

603
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

604
00:49:39,662 --> 00:49:40,243
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not bad.

605
00:49:42,097 --> 00:49:44,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's definitely worth $40 or get it on sale.

606
00:49:45,605 --> 00:49:46,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fun game.

607
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just there's like, I just think there's a lot.

608
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:53,742
[SPEAKER_07]: All they really need to do to fix it is just like, hey, can you like have some options?

609
00:49:53,822 --> 00:49:55,506
[SPEAKER_08]: A UI percentage scaler.

610
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Like take all UI elements and scale them down 50%.

611
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:05,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it didn't auto-detect my hardware or anything, and so when I started the game, I was in a super tiny window.

612
00:50:05,122 --> 00:50:07,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like 720p, just in the center of my screen.

613
00:50:07,926 --> 00:50:09,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what's going on here?

614
00:50:09,368 --> 00:50:13,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to go and adjust everything, because a default is a really stupid thing.

615
00:50:13,254 --> 00:50:17,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But they just have a UI scale or something like that that you can adjust.

616
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be so much better, or just an option like, hey, can I stop getting reminders for how to control it?

617
00:50:21,646 --> 00:50:22,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIV has that, and I love it.

618
00:50:23,308 --> 00:50:25,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XIV has the UI percentage.

619
00:50:25,051 --> 00:50:26,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

620
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:36,047
[SPEAKER_07]: basic UI stuff like just quality of life things that they could have just added into it and it would be so simple and make it so much better but I don't know.

621
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

622
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still fun to play.

623
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:45,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just minor annoyances that would make what would be like it's a good game to a great game I guess.

624
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week.

625
00:50:50,025 --> 00:50:55,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, considering the fact that I was gone most of the week, I actually had a very active gaming week.

626
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,717
[SPEAKER_08]: So, still playing some of the old standbys, Diablo 4.

627
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:04,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm going to finish all the Battle Pass quests this season, or whatever they call it, the season journey.

628
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really Battle Pass, it's the season journey.

629
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:10,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm going to finish it this season with my build, which I haven't done in a long time, so that's kind of exciting.

630
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:12,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been leaning into that.

631
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:15,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Final Fantasy XIV for the first time in a bit.

632
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:16,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a notice that my

633
00:51:16,563 --> 00:51:18,705
[SPEAKER_08]: House was going to get destroyed if I don't log in.

634
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:23,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, all right, I should log in and play and like check out some of the things they've done in the recent patches.

635
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I checked out their new deep dungeon.

636
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:29,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a little bit of that, that they just added the most recent patch that supports up to level 100.

637
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:30,498
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was playing a little bit of that.

638
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I was playing some new stuff.

639
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually checked out Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D remake.

640
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:40,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really excited to check that out because admittedly,

641
00:51:40,289 --> 00:52:07,123
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:26,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Reminds me nothing of the original Dragon Warrior.

643
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:45,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Quest or Dragon Warrior 1 has aged significantly and so of course they've got to do a lot graphically to it they're going to do some quality of life things like you don't need torches and dungeons anymore it's just an automatic thing because it goes with the art style but they really changed the story like a lot I'm talking like Final Fantasy 7 remake a lot

644
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:46,700
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

645
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:51,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, oh, OK, I didn't realize this is what it's going to be.

646
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:55,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel like there's a lot I still can't really evaluate until I beat it.

647
00:52:55,795 --> 00:53:06,051
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will just say this is just like a new Dragon Quest game that in theory has some threads that are in common with the original game.

648
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:07,732
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I understand.

649
00:53:08,093 --> 00:53:09,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand their big picture now.

650
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:21,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was obvious to some of you that are bigger and longer Dragon Quest fans than I. But it's very obvious that they released three first because chronologically it's first.

651
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:29,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And now they're releasing one and two to basically kind of, I guess, retcon the original trilogy as a chronological trilogy.

652
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:34,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of the changes they've made in one are to support three first.

653
00:53:34,516 --> 00:53:51,732
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

654
00:53:51,712 --> 00:54:14,732
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:39,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest 1, Dragon Quest 2, Dragon Quest 3

656
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:48,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Like fairies and characters that have threads to three, but they weren't in the original Nintendo version of the game.

657
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:53,340
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say it's very akin to the Final Fantasy VII Remake.

658
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got some elements.

659
00:54:55,145 --> 00:54:56,127
[SPEAKER_08]: of the original story.

660
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:01,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I would say the Final Fantasy VII remake actually had more threads than this does from where I'm sitting.

661
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,419
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, not bad.

662
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:03,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm enjoying my time.

663
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:04,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I do intend to beat it.

664
00:55:04,604 --> 00:55:07,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think it's a lot of fun to go through.

665
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:13,341
[SPEAKER_08]: They've put in a lot of collectible stuff like mini medals and the shiny spots on the map and the hidden layers and things like that.

666
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:17,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They've given you a lot to do and explore to sort of beef up what

667
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:42,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a new Dragon Quest game that has some threads to the original trilogy.

668
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,680
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I'm at.

669
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, then I also bought the Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.

670
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought both of those in the same day because they both came out when I was gone.

671
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not played as much of the Legacy Collection.

672
00:55:52,745 --> 00:55:58,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the Digital Eclipse, who does the Gold Master Series, like the Karateka, you know, and the, um...

673
00:55:58,662 --> 00:56:01,525
[SPEAKER_08]: The Tetris ones they did recently.

674
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:14,738
[SPEAKER_08]: This is their Mortal Kombat, but it's not technically a gold master because per Blue Sky replies, a gold master game is documentary first and the games are there as a nice to have.

675
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:23,607
[SPEAKER_08]: The collection is a games first, documentary second, even though I don't know from where I'm sitting, I get more excited about the documentary.

676
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:48,565
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

677
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:55,134
[SPEAKER_08]: or somebody that I know is about as good at Mortal Kombat as I am, I would do that.

678
00:56:55,154 --> 00:56:58,659
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to play against all the elite people online.

679
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a waste of my time.

680
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,064
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've been playing the single player.

681
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:12,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing Mortal Kombat 2 Arcade and I kind of liked that if I missed a fatality, I could just rewind and you can put the moves up on the screen and so I can practice and do it that way.

682
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:16,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like that'll help me next time I actually play the game in an arcade again.

683
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:17,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will...

684
00:57:17,907 --> 00:57:22,775
[SPEAKER_08]: The muscle memory I have for Katana's fatality, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick.

685
00:57:23,176 --> 00:57:23,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know.

686
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:25,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have that memorized.

687
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:26,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to a hard game.

688
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:29,906
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get the finishing screen, block, block, block, high kick, chop off the head with a fan.

689
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:31,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that.

690
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:33,091
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know any of the other moves.

691
00:57:33,172 --> 00:57:35,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't even remember all of Katana's moves.

692
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So having them on the screen has actually been very nice.

693
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so yeah, there's, there's parts of that.

694
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:49,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I like, I like that they have some of the more obscure Mortal Kombat titles like the Game Boy one and the PlayStation spinoff games, even if none of them are particularly good.

695
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:57,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I think sometimes a collection is not necessarily about having all of the good games, but having a complete retrospective.

696
00:57:57,437 --> 00:57:59,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And this seems to do a pretty good job from one to four.

697
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:08,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm enjoying it so far, but more to come once I finished the documentary, because I am noticing something pretty big missing from the documentary.

698
00:58:08,347 --> 00:58:29,072
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com.

699
00:58:29,052 --> 00:58:31,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, October 31st, is The Wall.

700
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:32,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I am resting.

701
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:33,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not doing anything.

702
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:42,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the next day, yes, last night, I knew I had tickets to go see, I keep wanting to say Dear Friends, but that's not what they call it.

703
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,591
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't called it that in years.

704
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:49,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Distant Worlds, the Final Fantasy Symphony, happened to be here in Sacramento for the very first time.

705
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:58,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went, because every other time I've seen it, I've driven to San Francisco, LA, when I went to the very, very first one, or even, I think there might have been one in San Jose that I saw.

706
00:58:58,030 --> 00:58:58,671
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went to San Francisco, LA,

707
00:58:58,651 --> 00:59:01,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the very first time it was in Sacramento.

708
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:02,877
[SPEAKER_08]: So I went to Distant Worlds.

709
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I went with Alan and we took our friend Dan.

710
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a late birthday present.

711
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:08,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a good show.

712
00:59:08,265 --> 00:59:12,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the first half was really like some of the best.

713
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:15,055
[SPEAKER_08]: The mix of music they played was like some of the best.

714
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:21,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's because now they have intentionally added a ton of 14 and 16 into it.

715
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:27,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will say if you're going to see the show this year and you've seen it before, you can count on the fact –

716
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:28,614
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to play Zanarkand.

717
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:30,216
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to play One Wing Angel.

718
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:31,978
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to play something from Nine.

719
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:35,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to play Liberty Fatale.

720
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:38,607
[SPEAKER_08]: They're always open with eights opening movie thing.

721
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:42,532
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some standards they are simply going to play every time.

722
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:51,123
[SPEAKER_08]: But this time they played four songs from Final Fantasy XIV and they played four songs from Final Fantasy XVI in the second half, which ate up a lot.

723
00:59:51,143 --> 00:59:54,848
[SPEAKER_08]: When you consider it's a night at the symphony and they're playing... There's maybe...

724
00:59:55,537 --> 01:00:23,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say maybe 15 songs tops they play all night so that was a big chunk of the program and the 14 part was really obviously I love 14 it was really cool to hear that they had the original vocalist that sang Flow and I can't remember the name of the Crystarium song in the moment but it's the really good ballad that goes with and she was the highlight of any time I have been to see Distant Worlds which is probably like four or five now

725
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:27,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Having her there actually singing live, she was fucking incredible.

726
01:00:27,196 --> 01:00:28,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda Aiken's her name.

727
01:00:28,638 --> 01:00:31,121
[SPEAKER_08]: She is incredible.

728
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to hear her sing the 14 songs live was great.

729
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was really a highlight and really worth the price of admission.

730
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:39,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be honest.

731
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:42,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everyone is going to like what I'm about to say.

732
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:43,536
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my opinion.

733
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:46,160
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take it or you can leave it.

734
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,122
[SPEAKER_08]: The Final Fantasy XVI stuff...

735
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:56,684
[SPEAKER_08]: It just reminded me how really woefully mediocre 16's soundtrack is in the grand scheme of things.

736
01:00:56,704 --> 01:01:00,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does pay me to say, I love Soken.

737
01:01:00,088 --> 01:01:01,570
[SPEAKER_08]: I love what he's done for 14.

738
01:01:02,051 --> 01:01:12,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think 16's soundtrack was not, it doesn't have as many standouts as even like 15, to be quite honest, or some of the ones that came before it.

739
01:01:12,686 --> 01:01:13,787
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have some bangers.

740
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:15,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the prelude.

741
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,691
[SPEAKER_08]: The Titan theme is great.

742
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:18,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Neither of those were played.

743
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:29,517
[SPEAKER_08]: but they did have Amanda come back out because I didn't even realize Amanda does sing the ballad at the end of 16 but that's also the

744
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: The most infuriating part of that game to me is the love theme, okay?

745
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the most infuriating part of 16 to me.

746
01:01:39,641 --> 01:01:41,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It was completely out of place in my opinion.

747
01:01:41,783 --> 01:01:49,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone into this before and we're way past the spoiler limit at this point, but I cannot stand the love story with Clive and Jill in that game.

748
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:53,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it feels extremely shoehorned into me.

749
01:01:53,934 --> 01:01:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that by nature, that song that goes with that whole thing

750
01:01:58,775 --> 01:02:22,352
[SPEAKER_08]: is just like she I can recognize and say she did a very lovely job performing it was a great performance and I can sit here and go I just don't like this the soundtrack does not the same now on the other hand I will tell me when they get Angela Aki I will be fair and say this I feel like they might have had her at more friends years ago years ago like 2006 or whenever I saw it at E3 um

751
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:37,438
[SPEAKER_08]: but I will say Alan and Dan don't know 16 as well so that whole segment was like we don't know these songs but Alan was like that first song was really good and I was like I couldn't even tell you what the name of it was

752
01:02:39,308 --> 01:02:41,430
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the song when Ifrit and Phoenix are fighting.

753
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:42,111
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that.

754
01:02:43,152 --> 01:02:43,472
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

755
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:46,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwell says Ben Starr is now sad.

756
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:48,197
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually used his voiceover.

757
01:02:48,217 --> 01:02:52,741
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only dialogue from those games I've heard in that performance.

758
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:57,006
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have Ben Starr's big accept the truth moment.

759
01:02:57,026 --> 01:02:58,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Come to me, Ifrit!

760
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:58,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Except they cut that part out.

761
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:00,489
[SPEAKER_08]: But everything leading up to it.

762
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:04,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they started playing that song with Ifrit.

763
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:05,574
[SPEAKER_08]: It was one of the songs they played.

764
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:07,476
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

765
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

766
01:03:32,903 --> 01:03:40,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, the one song they did play from 14 twice, so I heard it last year and heard it again, is the Beef Soft Tacos song.

767
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:43,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, if you don't know what song that is, it's the end singer.

768
01:03:43,757 --> 01:03:47,042
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the very last boss fight of Heavensward.

769
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:51,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to do the whole choir, and they're singing lyrics that sound like...

770
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:56,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos Supreme.

771
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:58,197
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the lyrics sound like.

772
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:04,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to like, like, I'm sitting there in my seat and I know they're saying whatever it is in Latin or other languages.

773
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just sitting there.

774
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:09,053
[SPEAKER_08]: All I hear in my head is Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos.

775
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:14,109
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, and I was telling Alan, I'm like, they played the Beef Soft Tacos song.

776
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:16,196
[SPEAKER_08]: He's looking at me like, you're a fucking freak.

777
01:04:16,256 --> 01:04:17,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's right.

778
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:17,901
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

779
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that was my gaming week.

780
01:04:19,466 --> 01:04:19,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Busy, busy.

781
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:22,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into some more gaming news.

782
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:23,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

783
01:04:24,473 --> 01:04:24,874
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

784
01:04:26,037 --> 01:04:29,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can go back and talk about some more Xbox stuff.

785
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:34,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So their revenue, as we mentioned, is not doing well.

786
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:39,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is where that whole 30% requirement is coming from.

787
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:43,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically saying, you know, that they have...

788
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:56,404
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

789
01:04:56,553 --> 01:05:19,337
[SPEAKER_07]: them wanting to charge $80 for all of the games that come out all that type of stuff because yeah right now they are working on increasing AI capacity by 80% this year that's where all the money at Microsoft is going is into that type of stuff and co-pilot and putting AI into Microsoft Teams and Calculator or whatever

790
01:05:19,317 --> 01:05:20,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Notepad.

791
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:22,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Notepad has AI now.

792
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:30,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is this why Copilot, the equivalent of the 2025 equivalent, or Bobby says in chat, this mandate's actually from 2023 and we're just finding out about it.

793
01:05:30,573 --> 01:05:30,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

794
01:05:31,254 --> 01:05:35,520
[SPEAKER_08]: The 2023 equivalent of Clippy is now showing up in Copilot.

795
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,242
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's worse because they have like

796
01:05:37,222 --> 01:05:38,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Other thing, it's not even Clippy.

797
01:05:38,724 --> 01:05:39,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like something else.

798
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:45,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I don't want to talk to that or do anything with that.

799
01:05:45,094 --> 01:05:46,996
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's a lot of that stuff.

800
01:05:47,036 --> 01:05:50,562
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also why you're seeing more employee cuts.

801
01:05:50,582 --> 01:05:53,686
[SPEAKER_07]: You're seeing games be canceled, like Perfect Dark.

802
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:56,130
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that type of stuff.

803
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all because of these mandates to...

804
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:03,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Make Lang go up.

805
01:06:05,075 --> 01:06:06,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Praise the shareholders.

806
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of stuff.

807
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's kind of annoying.

808
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:21,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if AI can't feed people this month, I think there's going to be a lot of people who don't give a flying fuck about what Copilot can do for them.

809
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:25,112
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the topic for another show.

810
01:06:26,594 --> 01:06:31,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But interesting that Microsoft, it's not...

811
01:06:31,441 --> 01:06:59,963
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

812
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:15,150
[SPEAKER_07]: you know maybe not making up what they could there but definitely going multi-platform will help with that but once again that also makes it more of a gamble when it comes to the next piece of hardware because it's like well

813
01:07:16,177 --> 01:07:45,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to buy a Microsoft console because I can just play your games when they come to PC or I can play Halo on my Playstation now exactly so it's like so that's really gonna eat into the next Microsoft console unless this console's like really doing something different I think if it's just like yeah the graphics are slightly better no it's gonna be AI stuff is gonna be what they push in the next console 100% 100%

814
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:50,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, cool, I guess.

815
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:51,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

816
01:07:51,555 --> 01:07:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

817
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:59,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of which, well, you know, and I think, I think too, and this next story is really going to underscore this.

818
01:07:59,565 --> 01:08:02,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, AI has always been around in video games.

819
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:04,951
[SPEAKER_08]: You would expect video games to have AI.

820
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:07,014
[SPEAKER_08]: This might shock you that I'm going to say this.

821
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:08,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Video games ought to have AI.

822
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:13,922
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to have player versus environment or player, you know, your game has to have AI.

823
01:08:14,202 --> 01:08:17,166
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had AI since the era of the Atari 2600.

824
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:20,430
[SPEAKER_08]: It's this generative and what it really is.

825
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:22,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I've given this a lot of thought.

826
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:24,055
[SPEAKER_08]: What's my red line?

827
01:08:24,155 --> 01:08:25,798
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it about AI that I don't like?

828
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:29,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, I'll use AI as an idea generator.

829
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll use AI for things here.

830
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:35,350
[SPEAKER_08]: But where I don't like it is when it starts to replace art.

831
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:35,931
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not...

832
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's not even necessarily, it's just the terminology gets changed.

833
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not artificial intelligence.

834
01:08:42,604 --> 01:08:56,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, artificial intelligence in the sense that I've coded some rules that this thing follows, that something follows, given environmental circumstances or a random...

835
01:08:56,431 --> 01:09:18,034
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

836
01:09:18,757 --> 01:09:24,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, sometimes it may summarize stuff, but we're not to a point where we can trust that that is correct.

837
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:29,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It is most of the time going to be wrong, and sometimes it can't even do the simplest of things.

838
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:31,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just, yeah.

839
01:09:32,206 --> 01:09:37,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, leading into this story about a brand new release that came out this week that apparently a lot of people are playing on Steam.

840
01:09:38,835 --> 01:09:44,804
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a looter shooter, so it's not really... I mean, once in a while I get into these games, but this one hasn't really been on my radar.

841
01:09:45,204 --> 01:09:48,949
[SPEAKER_08]: But I am seeing some friends online that are enjoying Ark Raiders.

842
01:09:48,969 --> 01:09:54,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of discourse, trademark patent pending, around the use of AI in Ark Raiders.

843
01:09:55,418 --> 01:09:56,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

844
01:09:56,540 --> 01:10:00,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have an AI generated content disclosure on the Steam page.

845
01:10:00,888 --> 01:10:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: And the disclosure says that during the development process, we may use procedural and AI based tools to assist with content creation.

846
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:13,553
[SPEAKER_08]: In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.

847
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:22,603
[SPEAKER_08]: and the design director, Virgil Watkins, when being interviewed by PC Games N said, Arc Raiders in no way uses generative AI whatsoever.

848
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:30,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And in an interview with Eurogamer, Stefan Strandberg, CCO said, the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI.

849
01:10:30,813 --> 01:10:43,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But it turns out the details are a little like, so, okay, it's not using like language generation, but what is happening is that some of it is voice actors.

850
01:10:43,267 --> 01:11:04,374
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently the text to speech is not all voice actor, meaning it is in the voice actor contract that we use AI for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like the ping system, where it says every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions.

851
01:11:04,855 --> 01:11:11,383
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game.

852
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:23,140
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's the interesting sort of muddy waters now we're in because they're claiming we don't want a voice actor to have to come in and name the, you know, thousand things that are in the game.

853
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,326
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, again, some of us that sort of really appreciate... Why does it need to do that?

854
01:11:27,346 --> 01:11:27,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

855
01:11:28,187 --> 01:11:28,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

856
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:30,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does it need to do that?

857
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:35,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Then make it a very obviously robotic type of voice or something.

858
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:36,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

859
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:38,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't love this.

860
01:11:38,402 --> 01:11:40,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like this is trying to be like...

861
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:47,811
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not really screwing over the voice actors, but we're mandating that they allow us to use their voice to generate stuff in the game.

862
01:11:47,831 --> 01:11:51,357
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just so many lines we'd have to pay them for, and we don't want to do that.

863
01:11:51,377 --> 01:11:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that not against the part of the agreement with SAG-AFTRA?

864
01:11:56,105 --> 01:11:57,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Not when your game is made in Sweden.

865
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:02,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's and that's the loophole.

866
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:07,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, so just something to consider with the game.

867
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:13,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, if the voice actor is getting compensated for it, I don't know.

868
01:12:13,358 --> 01:12:17,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I just it's it's a slippery slope.

869
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:32,282
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

870
01:12:32,262 --> 01:12:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, apparently AI tools were used to create a 3D model of the game from a YouTube video.

871
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:43,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It was more of a research project, but not something that they're using in the game now.

872
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:48,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I think AI as a play field is whatever.

873
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:52,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine, but it's interesting.

874
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:59,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be seeing more about this and a lot of companies trying to figure out the ethical use of AI over the coming years.

875
01:12:59,648 --> 01:13:05,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of them are completely signed in onto... This is a wasteland.

876
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:06,939
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to use it for whatever we want.

877
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's other companies that are really trying to figure out how do we ethically use this?

878
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll be interesting to see how that works.

879
01:13:15,272 --> 01:13:15,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

880
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

881
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other comments and chat on this.

882
01:13:19,662 --> 01:13:20,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very interesting.

883
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:24,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby is pointing out the SAG-AFTRA thing only applies in the U.S.

884
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:28,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's why a lot of movies are moving production to the U.K.

885
01:13:28,233 --> 01:13:31,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we need to get some worldwide lockdown on this.

886
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:36,604
[SPEAKER_08]: QuestBuster says, as a note, they used AI tools in the finals for some of the announcer voice lines.

887
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:43,292
[SPEAKER_08]: They recorded with real actors and then used AI to generate contextual audio, which they appear to have continued with ARC.

888
01:13:43,272 --> 01:14:09,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says, I think in this case, they're specifically scripting what the AI voice is saying, unlike Fortnite.

889
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,220
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what continues to develop.

890
01:14:12,961 --> 01:14:16,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, pleasant little announcement from earlier this week.

891
01:14:16,145 --> 01:14:16,646
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

892
01:14:18,348 --> 01:14:19,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

893
01:14:19,309 --> 01:14:20,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing.

894
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I not say that it would take something along the lines of a new Animal Crossing to make me get a Switch 2?

895
01:14:26,799 --> 01:14:29,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not a new Animal Crossing.

896
01:14:29,062 --> 01:14:30,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me finish.

897
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

898
01:14:33,889 --> 01:14:45,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said something like, and I said that very specifically, because Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update is coming out and there is a Switch 2 edition on the way.

899
01:14:45,203 --> 01:14:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: This is free for any New Horizons players, whichever version that you have, with a lot of new content, although some is very specifically Switch 2 related.

900
01:14:57,337 --> 01:15:01,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be out on January 15th, 2026.

901
01:15:02,643 --> 01:15:04,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Both versions available the same day.

902
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:16,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are going to be getting things like Resetti's Reset Service, the Katten's Resort Hotel, so they're bringing the entire Kappa family.

903
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:23,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get to decorate hotel rooms kind of like it was Happy Home Designer.

904
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:34,397
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is awesome and you can invite people via amiibo cards to come and stay in your hotel I think indefinitely

905
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:39,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be getting to the rest of this.

906
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:46,250
[SPEAKER_02]: The Switch 2 upgrade pack is not free.

907
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,155
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the one that's about $5.

908
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:54,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I was referring to that's free is the Switch version which is the one I'm focusing on first.

909
01:15:55,336 --> 01:16:22,120
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also are getting upgraded storage your storage goes up to I believe 9,000 items you have the dream world and the slumber islands which you can just basically build infinite extra islands so there you go you get three it's not infinite three how about let me do the thing myself thank you um

910
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:26,226
[SPEAKER_02]: There are Lego items.

911
01:16:26,246 --> 01:16:30,232
[SPEAKER_02]: There are new Zelda items, new Amiibo.

912
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,456
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Splatoon items.

913
01:16:32,476 --> 01:16:37,103
[SPEAKER_02]: There's NES and Game Boy games, different consoles, retro toys.

914
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the Dream Island, as I was getting to, they're not permanent.

915
01:16:45,235 --> 01:16:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start over.

916
01:16:46,257 --> 01:16:49,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do as many different ones as you want to, up to three.

917
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:54,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited about the Katten Hotel.

918
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:56,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that.

919
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:09,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And then though for Switch 2, there of course is going to be an immediate graphic improvement.

920
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:21,303
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be 12-player multiplayer, the megaphone item, mouse controls with the Joy-Con, and again, like I said, improved resolution.

921
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:31,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also kind of excited that we're getting the systems in the words section.

922
01:17:32,587 --> 01:17:59,725
[SPEAKER_02]: The video game system is available in the store Like with the NES you get Clu Clu and Ice Climbers And Dr. Mario for Game Boy It even is specifying that you have a Famicom Disk System An NES, a Super Famicom There's the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine, the Love Tester All of those are back So that's pretty cool

923
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:08,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with Artisuya in chat who says some of the in-game Nintendo merch is definitely tempting me to come back.

924
01:18:08,254 --> 01:18:08,794
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where I'm at.

925
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:16,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I realize that the NES stuff and all the stuff they're putting in are bridges to the online console service.

926
01:18:16,463 --> 01:18:18,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I understand that that is like an element.

927
01:18:19,086 --> 01:18:26,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I still love – like I'm fine with them leveraging that because I feel like to me that's Animal Crossing kind of going back –

928
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:28,658
[SPEAKER_08]: To its roots, in a way.

929
01:18:28,678 --> 01:18:31,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And what drew me into Animal Crossing in the first place.

930
01:18:31,483 --> 01:18:33,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really exciting to me.

931
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:36,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think all the Lego and the Zelda stuff is just a bonus.

932
01:18:37,313 --> 01:18:42,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be quite honest, I didn't really bother with Animal Crossing when the 2.0 version came out.

933
01:18:42,062 --> 01:18:44,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I never bothered with it.

934
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:49,074
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited to have a reason to revisit.

935
01:18:49,395 --> 01:18:51,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Although...

936
01:18:51,258 --> 01:19:21,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little sad it's not a new game and I feel like this is a time buyer for an inevitable new game but then again Mario Kart we got a shit ton of tracks from Mario Kart 8 and we didn't get Mario Kart World until a little while later it wasn't that long of a wait for Mario Kart World so I shouldn't jump to that conclusion it's tempting to do but I guess maybe with Mario Kart there could

937
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:48,147
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, be that kind of precedent that they can turn around and do a new Animal Crossing real fast But it sounds like there's enough meat in this Especially because, to be honest, I didn't see the full trailer So a lot of this stuff Jamie's saying, I'm like, oh, I didn't know there was all this other stuff that's going in it too I just heard about that I watched the whole trailer I'm just like, oh, this sounds like there's going to be enough meat here That it's going to make the game worth revisiting Because I have not played it since 1.0

938
01:19:48,397 --> 01:20:12,042
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's also if you don't have some of the amiibos you will get special visitors showing up like Minero and Tulen they can be random visitors that show up at the campsite so you do have that and I don't know what anyone's saying about this ripping off of

939
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hello Kitty thing, because this has been kind of a thing with Animal Crossing, the ability to decorate the rooms and have people visit.

940
01:20:20,323 --> 01:20:22,428
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just an expansion of the campsite.

941
01:20:24,192 --> 01:20:28,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's also a little bit more like Tortimer's Island, come to think of it.

942
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:37,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think the 12 people multiplayer is really fascinating too, because I think about my friends that did like, and I thought it, I honest to God thought it was limited to four.

943
01:20:37,656 --> 01:20:40,400
[SPEAKER_08]: They must have upped it to eight in 2.0 and I just missed it.

944
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,181
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't on my radar.

945
01:20:42,363 --> 01:20:47,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but I had friends that did like an online survivor thing in Animal Crossing.

946
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:51,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm just thinking about, oh my God, they actually can have a decent sized tribe now if 12 people can.

947
01:20:51,897 --> 01:20:52,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Do that.

948
01:20:53,021 --> 01:20:54,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, that's going to be so fun.

949
01:20:55,149 --> 01:20:57,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and with the little cameras and the people.

950
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's going to be actually super fun.

951
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it's...

952
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:06,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's... I'm glad the game gets a little bit of a renaissance.

953
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:18,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo has these very interesting ways of just bringing these old-ass games... It's not even old, but just... Maybe because so many games in this day and age feel like they come and go in six months.

954
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,190
[SPEAKER_08]: There's very few games that stay.

955
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:22,832
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

956
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:24,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it was from the before time.

957
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:26,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, with the whole COVID thing.

958
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:37,926
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I definitely, Bobby talked about a very interesting sort of, I don't know if you'd call it like a Pavlov association or something, but basically that like Animal Crossing kind of takes him back to a similar mental state from COVID.

959
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:40,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of one of those, I can see that.

960
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:47,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see where like Animal Crossing could be kind of like triggering in a way of that sort of time and era.

961
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:49,197
[SPEAKER_08]: It just kind of depends what you associate with it.

962
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:49,697
Yeah.

963
01:21:49,677 --> 01:22:14,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I still wish there's like some stuff though that like it's like once again going back to quality of life discussions with some of these games like one of the things that's bugged me the most about this most recent Animal Crossing is the the first user on your Switch console that started the game is now in charge of the island and in this case my youngest son who doesn't play the game anymore is

964
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:18,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It is annoying to have to log into his account to do certain things.

965
01:22:19,002 --> 01:22:26,134
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have an option in the game to change which user is in primary control of your island.

966
01:22:26,274 --> 01:22:31,663
[SPEAKER_07]: It is stupid that it is locked down permanently forever to one user.

967
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:34,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they just add that to the game to fix that?

968
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just be so much easier.

969
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:39,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome for me because I don't want Dan to do crap to my island.

970
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:47,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's your option, but it should be the option to be able to correct that as well.

971
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:57,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird quality of life stuff that they have, and also a lot of the stuff that they're adding, it's nice that there is some new things, but it feels like it's a retread of the whole paid DLC.

972
01:22:57,350 --> 01:23:06,327
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just decorating rooms, a little bit lesser to an extent because you're not doing the exterior as well, but it kind of feels like the same thing.

973
01:23:06,307 --> 01:23:09,430
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only if you bother getting it for Switch, too.

974
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,694
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just playing the Switch version, no charge at all.

975
01:23:15,497 --> 01:23:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's kind of interesting.

976
01:23:17,038 --> 01:23:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: The DLC, though, I thought the DLC was paid.

977
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:21,083
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

978
01:23:21,683 --> 01:23:22,164
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

979
01:23:22,324 --> 01:23:23,085
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all free.

980
01:23:23,926 --> 01:23:29,732
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Happy Home Designer, no, no, that's part of the thing.

981
01:23:31,417 --> 01:23:37,085
[SPEAKER_02]: According to what the trailer said and according to what I'm reading here, that's all part of it.

982
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:39,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I'm saying that it was paid DLC.

983
01:23:39,308 --> 01:23:42,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It was similar to the old DLC.

984
01:23:42,573 --> 01:23:44,756
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Happy Home Paradise DLC.

985
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:45,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different.

986
01:23:45,477 --> 01:23:46,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, that's what I'm saying.

987
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:49,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to that, which is kind of weird.

988
01:23:49,503 --> 01:23:58,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to further complicate it, but wasn't that actually bundled in for free, even though it was paid DLC, if you were like a Nintendo Plus thing?

989
01:23:57,995 --> 01:24:00,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly so.

990
01:24:00,272 --> 01:24:02,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would have been paying for the plus anyway.

991
01:24:02,529 --> 01:24:03,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a fucking map.

992
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:29,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of Switch 2 people are assuming they have to pay $5 to play it on Switch 2 but technically you can play the Switch 1 version on your Switch 2 and you'll get the 3.0 that's the bridge that's kind of missing I wish they would address though with it because there's the whole animation when people come to your island and leave your island now imagine and multiply that by 12

993
01:24:31,087 --> 01:24:35,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to get very... Oh, the loading area.

994
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:42,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's why you can do the disconnect thing instead, even though the leaving through the gate is supposed to be safer.

995
01:24:42,122 --> 01:24:44,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just all the same if the player disconnects.

996
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:47,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you don't get the animation.

997
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:49,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It just says so and so is disconnected.

998
01:24:50,513 --> 01:24:51,514
[SPEAKER_07]: You should just have an option.

999
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I guess it has to load stuff, but...

1000
01:24:55,842 --> 01:25:04,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now, I think, actually all it was is you just had the little, I mean, you have the thing of them walking off and on, but you don't have to watch the plane arrive and leave every time.

1001
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:09,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Only the person traveling sees the full thing.

1002
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:16,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to having a reason to revisit the game again because I want a Nintendo collection in my basement.

1003
01:25:16,123 --> 01:25:20,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, even if I'm paying for Switch Online, I can play those games anyway.

1004
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:22,909
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just something about the collecting.

1005
01:25:22,929 --> 01:25:25,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, I like to collect games and have them in my house.

1006
01:25:26,112 --> 01:25:26,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of us do.

1007
01:25:26,812 --> 01:25:29,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have the PlayChoice10 stuff in there.

1008
01:25:29,595 --> 01:25:30,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they should have.

1009
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:33,058
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have the full arcade cabinets so you can play the PlayChoice10 stuff.

1010
01:25:33,078 --> 01:25:37,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be cool if they had new games, but I just don't know.

1011
01:25:37,662 --> 01:25:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's asking for a lot.

1012
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad we're getting this.

1013
01:25:40,544 --> 01:25:42,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean not getting new games?

1014
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting Game Boy titles.

1015
01:25:44,731 --> 01:25:46,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting Famicom Disk System.

1016
01:25:46,815 --> 01:25:49,199
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting games that have not been available before.

1017
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:52,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but they're all things that are on the Switch Online.

1018
01:25:52,404 --> 01:25:55,930
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a bridge to the Switch Online catalog.

1019
01:25:56,932 --> 01:26:00,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is very clever, and it's giving people what they asked for.

1020
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:01,359
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I get it.

1021
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:02,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree.

1022
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:03,302
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clever.

1023
01:26:03,322 --> 01:26:04,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy for this bridge.

1024
01:26:04,605 --> 01:26:09,312
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was just like, oh, it might be kind of fun if there's a game you can only unlock through Animal Crossing.

1025
01:26:09,352 --> 01:26:12,677
[SPEAKER_08]: But I understand that Nintendo doesn't want to cannibalize Switch Online.

1026
01:26:12,698 --> 01:26:18,747
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just one of those, it's a pipe dream thing that when I sit down and think, is this logistically the smartest thing to do?

1027
01:26:18,767 --> 01:26:20,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I go, no, it's probably not.

1028
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:22,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what it ends up.

1029
01:26:23,238 --> 01:26:37,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it would be great to actually now have those items for the Super Famicom or the disc system or have the actual console models in the game Yeah, I do like that it's more than just the NES models, that's kind of neat

1030
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:55,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, there's a channel I've been following that goes into some of the programming things that they did to make your game glitch out and modify for earlier versions and how much of that original code carries over into the modern Animal Crossings.

1031
01:26:56,345 --> 01:27:01,790
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some stuff in there including part of its inventory system that is the same by necessity.

1032
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:07,015
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot... I've kind of gotten this...

1033
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:14,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Approach lately, the yeah, so and such may be annoying, but I have a feeling it is programmed that way for a very specific reason.

1034
01:27:14,733 --> 01:27:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe it's just that Dead by Daylight has lowered my standards.

1035
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:24,269
[SPEAKER_08]: A little calm A, a little calm B. All right, let's move on.

1036
01:27:25,171 --> 01:27:25,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we at?

1037
01:27:25,832 --> 01:27:26,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I think.

1038
01:27:27,735 --> 01:27:32,023
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk about our favorite topic as of right now.

1039
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:52,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1040
01:27:53,266 --> 01:28:16,692
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1041
01:28:18,123 --> 01:28:20,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Olympic esport games were dumb.

1042
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:25,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the chess stuff, that makes sense, but archery on a mobile phone?

1043
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:26,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1044
01:28:27,224 --> 01:28:28,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of dumb.

1045
01:28:29,108 --> 01:28:31,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, some of the games mentioned there.

1046
01:28:31,173 --> 01:28:35,102
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, it also makes sense...

1047
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:43,604
[SPEAKER_08]: as to why Saudi Arabia is trying to buy up so much of video games because if they are turning it into a global sport and all of this... It could be bigger than the Olympics.

1048
01:28:43,624 --> 01:28:50,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, think of all the money that something like MLB or NBA or those big sports leagues rake in.

1049
01:28:50,803 --> 01:28:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that...

1050
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:57,775
[SPEAKER_08]: The Saudi government wants to invest in, which is kind of kind of honestly, that's already kind of been a known thing.

1051
01:28:58,235 --> 01:28:59,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, yeah.

1052
01:28:59,197 --> 01:29:08,270
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very originally we're going to be in a 12 year partnership that they agreed on a 12 year partnership back last year, actually.

1053
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're just like, Nope.

1054
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:35,312
[SPEAKER_08]: but it sounds like Saudi Arabia now just wants to maybe make their own damn thing like we don't need the Olympics we'll create a must we'll pay oodles and oodles of money to get some of the big names to come to Saudi Arabia and play their big games and you know create our own pretend work crimes and how they kill people is not happening yes

1055
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:39,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what the ultimate hope is, yes.

1056
01:29:39,606 --> 01:29:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: That we will all just forget that all of that is going on.

1057
01:29:43,154 --> 01:29:43,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1058
01:29:44,898 --> 01:29:45,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1059
01:29:47,605 --> 01:29:48,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

1060
01:29:49,838 --> 01:29:56,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about something else I'd like to forget is going on, and that is that there's layoffs going on everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.

1061
01:29:56,068 --> 01:30:02,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And Amazon, as some of you have talked about in chat earlier tonight, Amazon is one of those companies that did get hit with job cuts.

1062
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:09,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of their job cuts this week ended up affecting New World, which I don't mean to sound bitchy.

1063
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,392
[SPEAKER_08]: because it is really sad.

1064
01:30:11,452 --> 01:30:13,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not enjoy hearing stories of job loss.

1065
01:30:13,815 --> 01:30:22,585
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I'm also surprised that New World was still going because I sort of thought that game was already sort of cooked some time ago.

1066
01:30:22,605 --> 01:30:26,309
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed like it made a big splash when it launched and then it kind of disappeared.

1067
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:37,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, Amazon has not had a great track record in the gaming realm, which is wild, wild when they own this site.

1068
01:30:37,763 --> 01:30:41,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Here I am on my soapbox again.

1069
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:50,867
[SPEAKER_08]: How does Amazon not get this right to leverage what they have here on Twitch television into generating more hype for their games?

1070
01:30:51,489 --> 01:30:55,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand the disconnect, but here we are.

1071
01:30:55,516 --> 01:31:11,567
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's not just New World because New World at least it felt like it had a somewhat successful launch it just kind of sank after that it didn't it didn't hold people it was that whole you know remember I said the hot shit for six months and then then you're gone vary that with New World except it was more like two three months

1072
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:34,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon wrote in a blog post at newworld.com,

1073
01:31:35,088 --> 01:31:55,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1074
01:31:55,658 --> 01:31:57,201
[SPEAKER_08]: You can still buy New World.

1075
01:31:57,421 --> 01:32:02,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are saying that PlayStation Plus subscribers for extra and premium can still get that until further notice.

1076
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:06,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nighthaven is apparently free for everybody right now.

1077
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:09,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And the company has committed to running the servers through 2026.

1078
01:32:10,403 --> 01:32:10,984
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1079
01:32:11,774 --> 01:32:20,810
[SPEAKER_08]: They said they will provide a minimum of six months notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World Aeternum.

1080
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait for New New World to come out at some point.

1081
01:32:23,575 --> 01:32:28,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it may not because apparently Amazon, Bloomberg did a whole thing on it.

1082
01:32:28,464 --> 01:32:32,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And that usually means somebody internal sent something to Jason.

1083
01:32:33,012 --> 01:32:36,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And Amazon told staff in a memo that...

1084
01:32:36,057 --> 01:32:42,003
[SPEAKER_08]: That as part of widespread layoffs, it's going to dial back big budget games, especially MMOs.

1085
01:32:42,544 --> 01:32:45,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So Thrown in Liberty, Lost Ark.

1086
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:48,129
[SPEAKER_08]: These are MMOs that Amazon has published, even though somebody else developed them.

1087
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:49,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Those will continue.

1088
01:32:50,652 --> 01:32:55,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon not commenting on the Lord of the Rings MMO that apparently they've been making for a while.

1089
01:32:55,357 --> 01:32:58,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like Lord of the Rings, even worse, sorry, not Lord of the Rings.

1090
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:03,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazon, even worse than Niantic, a company I've been following for a long time.

1091
01:33:03,445 --> 01:33:03,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1092
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:30,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1093
01:33:31,947 --> 01:33:39,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, New World, just so you know, there are 914,000 people still playing it on Steam over the weekend.

1094
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:48,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's interesting, but it just sounds like maybe Amazon sort of bit off more than they can chew with the gaming thing.

1095
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:53,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Or again, I feel like Amazon may not know how to run itself as such a mega company.

1096
01:33:54,509 --> 01:34:01,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming back to the Microsoft thing, there needs to be some type of meeting in the minds.

1097
01:34:01,478 --> 01:34:07,375
[SPEAKER_08]: What is our company and what do we do?

1098
01:34:07,395 --> 01:34:09,641
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's a lot to ask, apparently.

1099
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:14,796
[SPEAKER_08]: These mega companies just keep growing and growing and growing with no aim in mind.

1100
01:34:15,147 --> 01:34:19,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf says Twitch was affected, but not super affected.

1101
01:34:19,952 --> 01:34:20,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They did lose some people.

1102
01:34:21,013 --> 01:34:25,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did hear that some Twitch people were unfortunately impacted with this.

1103
01:34:25,919 --> 01:34:28,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's left running Twitch right now?

1104
01:34:29,743 --> 01:34:34,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of what I want to know, but interesting.

1105
01:34:36,090 --> 01:34:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby says Microsoft should have sold off the Xbox division or made it its own company instead of buying Activision.

1106
01:34:42,557 --> 01:34:42,657
Yeah.

1107
01:34:43,075 --> 01:35:09,403
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1108
01:35:09,772 --> 01:35:12,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Quest Buster in chat says about New World.

1109
01:35:12,495 --> 01:35:16,780
[SPEAKER_08]: It had a rough launch, but it managed to retain enough players to keep going.

1110
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:22,848
[SPEAKER_08]: The latest expansion was really good and brought a lot of players back right before they announced the party was over.

1111
01:35:22,928 --> 01:35:23,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's interesting.

1112
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:29,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if the latest expansion was good, unfortunately, the word isn't out there everywhere.

1113
01:35:29,596 --> 01:35:35,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe Amazon just doesn't know how to market their games.

1114
01:35:35,503 --> 01:35:37,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if only there was a major website.

1115
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:45,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I'm sure there's plenty of ads for New World on this website, but I wouldn't know because I bought the thing that hides all the ads.

1116
01:35:47,419 --> 01:35:52,786
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a website that they maybe had lots of eyes in front of it and then a streaming platform.

1117
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they don't have that.

1118
01:35:56,472 --> 01:35:56,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1119
01:35:57,653 --> 01:35:57,954
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1120
01:35:58,514 --> 01:35:58,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1121
01:35:58,915 --> 01:36:00,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie needed to step away for a minute.

1122
01:36:00,677 --> 01:36:04,703
[SPEAKER_08]: She is up next, but I think what we'll do, we'll just skip over to Loki's story and then come back.

1123
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:14,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, two of the directors from the Multiverses game have formed a brand new studio, Airlock Games.

1124
01:36:15,707 --> 01:36:19,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And instead of making giant fighting games featuring Warner Bros.

1125
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:29,526
[SPEAKER_07]: characters, they are now making a more smaller indie title that looks a little bit like a space...

1126
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:36,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Sim type game, a little pixel art space sim game called What the Stars Forgot.

1127
01:36:36,193 --> 01:36:40,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's their brand new first game for their brand new company, Airlock Games.

1128
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:51,720
[SPEAKER_07]: They are putting it on Kickstarter and it's like, man, we're like 20 years back again and we're kickstarting games and everything is hunky dory and stuff like that.

1129
01:36:51,921 --> 01:36:54,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, apparently...

1130
01:36:55,612 --> 01:37:06,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it looks interesting They're planning on launching the game in early access in December But yeah, it's a sci-fi sim management horror game

1131
01:37:07,964 --> 01:37:11,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see the phoenix from the ashes sort of thing.

1132
01:37:11,469 --> 01:37:16,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I realize it's not the whole, you know, it's just a couple of the directors involved and so forth.

1133
01:37:16,135 --> 01:37:23,045
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's nice to sort of see that wish of, I hope these people that are affected by the layoff can go and launch their own studio.

1134
01:37:23,125 --> 01:37:23,966
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see.

1135
01:37:24,066 --> 01:37:26,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that takes money, that takes investment.

1136
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:29,234
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see that actually happen once in a while, right?

1137
01:37:29,334 --> 01:37:31,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice to see that that's happening.

1138
01:37:31,056 --> 01:37:33,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And by golly, I hope the game is good.

1139
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:45,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I mean, also like with all these big game studios that seem like they can't fail or are too big to fail and that releasing, you know, products that are underwhelming or stuff like that.

1140
01:37:46,028 --> 01:37:53,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And all these massive layoffs that we're having, I think you're going to see a lot of these indie studios kind of come out and a lot of them be successful.

1141
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:58,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we've seen that in the last few years, there's been a lot of these like game of the year projects.

1142
01:37:58,268 --> 01:38:04,818
[SPEAKER_07]: titles that are from smaller independent studios where these bigger studios are like, you can't make a game like that.

1143
01:38:05,499 --> 01:38:22,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can't make a game like that because it won't be as profitable as our shareholders want, but you can make a game like that that will be profitable for the studio and make them enough money to continue to make the next big game or the next project they want to work on if it's not a super huge game.

1144
01:38:22,806 --> 01:38:23,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think...

1145
01:38:23,767 --> 01:38:33,962
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully we'll see a lot of these people land on their feet and maybe spin up some of these studios and see what happens but then again then they eventually get bought and it's like continues again

1146
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:41,125
[SPEAKER_08]: On that note, on a similar note, it is wild to me that Claire Obscure did not come out three years ago.

1147
01:38:41,546 --> 01:38:44,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the Game Awards are next month, right?

1148
01:38:44,309 --> 01:38:46,912
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about a month away from the Game Awards, which is a whole other thing, right?

1149
01:38:47,312 --> 01:38:54,460
[SPEAKER_08]: To which I expect Claire Obscure is going to win a lot of stuff, although I guess some people are saying there's some other... What's the other big one that just came out recently?

1150
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Claire Obscure, though, is gorgeous.

1151
01:38:56,522 --> 01:39:01,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, and I think there's so much, you know, I think that's the one to be...

1152
01:39:01,347 --> 01:39:09,282
[SPEAKER_08]: but like it's honestly honest to god it feels like that game came out three years ago like it's it's wild to me that that was a game from this year

1153
01:39:09,397 --> 01:39:17,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, DarkSakura, we'll go to you in just a moment, but I do want to read some of these other comments that came in from chat on the New World thing because there is quite a bit here.

1154
01:39:17,688 --> 01:39:26,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf talking about Amazon and maybe where they misfired says, Amazon thought they could take down Steam because they were Amazon and Valve was not.

1155
01:39:26,219 --> 01:39:30,786
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of companies have felt that they could take down Steam and have had mixed success.

1156
01:39:30,886 --> 01:39:35,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Epic being the only one that has had a reasonable amount of success and Epic has Fortnite.

1157
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:36,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1158
01:39:36,413 --> 01:39:39,561
[SPEAKER_08]: and Valve had a mandatory Steam install with everything.

1159
01:39:39,582 --> 01:39:41,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus they were kind of first out the gate in that one.

1160
01:39:41,848 --> 01:39:46,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I want to say first, but they were early out the gate with the must-have game.

1161
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,165
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the right formula at the right time.

1162
01:39:49,027 --> 01:39:49,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1163
01:39:50,015 --> 01:39:55,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby says they were surprised that they couldn't just snap their fingers and make a game store and have everyone use it instead of Steam.

1164
01:39:55,066 --> 01:40:01,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's the same EA with Origin, Ubisoft with Air Launcher, Stadia.

1165
01:40:01,881 --> 01:40:03,705
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are learning this.

1166
01:40:03,725 --> 01:40:07,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gwen points out that New World is through Steam.

1167
01:40:07,092 --> 01:40:08,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, yeah, it is, it is.

1168
01:40:09,597 --> 01:40:15,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And Looney Barred also mentioning that they were in the game when the news hit.

1169
01:40:15,911 --> 01:40:26,333
[SPEAKER_08]: People had just bought the paid track of the season and new cosmetics, and as soon as the main page told us what was happening, the game population went down by two-thirds in a few minutes.

1170
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:51,072
[SPEAKER_08]: that's wild people wanted to just abandon ship that quickly that's I don't know I feel like if a game I really loved like I don't know Final Fantasy 14 let's say they say tomorrow oh we're shutting down the Final Fantasy 14 servers I wouldn't want to like just stop playing the game all of a sudden like I don't know uh it might be in that moment you might just need to step away from it yeah yeah

1171
01:40:51,052 --> 01:40:55,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a moment to process how much money I've spent over the years and all that.

1172
01:40:55,337 --> 01:40:57,759
[SPEAKER_02]: At least with Stadia, I got all my money back.

1173
01:40:57,859 --> 01:40:58,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1174
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that makes sense.

1175
01:40:59,781 --> 01:41:03,786
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had to fly to Alabama, so it came in really handy.

1176
01:41:04,046 --> 01:41:06,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Mishin Chat says, it makes me sad because I really like that one.

1177
01:41:06,809 --> 01:41:14,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just because I hadn't played a lot of New World, I recognize it had its fans, but it seemed like it had a real problem getting a lot of new ones.

1178
01:41:14,697 --> 01:41:16,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1179
01:41:16,299 --> 01:41:16,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1180
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:17,801
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on.

1181
01:41:17,841 --> 01:41:18,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura.

1182
01:41:18,782 --> 01:41:20,063
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exciting news to me.

1183
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:23,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I immediately told Dan that I have to attend.

1184
01:41:25,144 --> 01:41:41,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, one of my favorite ever sound designers and composers, Akira Yamaoka, or properly Yamaoka Akira, has been a mainstay in a lot of whatever playlists I have going on.

1185
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:49,645
[SPEAKER_02]: He has done a number of sound direction, including Silent Hill, of course.

1186
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:53,412
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medium, Lollipop Chainsaw, all of that.

1187
01:41:53,532 --> 01:41:59,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is doing a US tour starting in February 20, 2026.

1188
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:05,794
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's bringing some of his soundtracks to play on stage.

1189
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:16,078
[SPEAKER_02]: and working with Raj Ramaya, who is known for his work on Cowboy Bebop and Resident Evil, who is opening for Yamaoka.

1190
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also collaborated on a single called Encrypted Code Reality, which will be actually available yesterday on Halloween.

1191
01:42:23,936 --> 01:42:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Have to go get it.

1192
01:42:24,978 --> 01:42:31,568
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tour dates are starting in Los Angeles on the 19th.

1193
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:36,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I probably would be trying to go to that one, but I bet it's going to be crazy expensive.

1194
01:42:37,877 --> 01:42:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Then show dates in Phoenix, Arizona, San Diego, Orlando, Florida, New York, Dallas, Austin.

1195
01:42:47,051 --> 01:42:51,998
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tickets go on sale on Friday, November 24th.

1196
01:42:51,978 --> 01:42:53,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go.

1197
01:42:55,225 --> 01:42:56,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone needs to make this happen for me.

1198
01:42:57,008 --> 01:43:01,979
[SPEAKER_08]: This news is actually really upsetting to me because his tour is the same week.

1199
01:43:01,999 --> 01:43:08,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all like the dates are like it's only like 10 days and it's when I'm on the Star Trek cruise.

1200
01:43:08,853 --> 01:43:37,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I fly out on the 19th and I get back on the 27th yeah it's just bad bad luck on my part I mean if I really wanted to go I would pick one or the other um but I'm not gonna say actually technically that Orlando date is the day after we get back and the cruise is out of Orlando so you bet your ass the thought has crossed my mind could I extend my stay for a day so I can go to that concert but there comes a point where I start to go

1201
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:41,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're crossing the line into that's irresponsible at this point.

1202
01:43:41,908 --> 01:43:45,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to get back to my real life and everything after all that.

1203
01:43:45,754 --> 01:43:46,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But don't cry for me.

1204
01:43:46,955 --> 01:43:50,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going on an adventure that I love to do every year.

1205
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:52,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what it is.

1206
01:43:52,664 --> 01:43:54,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I was bummed when I saw the dates.

1207
01:43:54,206 --> 01:43:54,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, really?

1208
01:43:55,027 --> 01:43:57,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Of all the weeks in the year, he had to pick that one?

1209
01:43:57,091 --> 01:43:59,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I hope it does really well.

1210
01:43:59,815 --> 01:44:02,398
[SPEAKER_02]: He just knew that you weren't going to be able to go during those times.

1211
01:44:02,418 --> 01:44:02,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1212
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:03,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about me.

1213
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:07,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this crazy American's gonna go on a boat instead of listening to me?

1214
01:44:07,505 --> 01:44:17,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he is on my Facebook, but if he's smart, he's not reading it either, so... I don't look at it anymore.

1215
01:44:17,177 --> 01:44:20,241
[SPEAKER_08]: As 200 Matt says, maybe he'll add more dates if it sells well.

1216
01:44:20,261 --> 01:44:21,683
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of where I'm at.

1217
01:44:21,703 --> 01:44:31,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I still wish, as much as I'm salty, I wish this thing nothing but huge success, because if he makes lots of money for his family...

1218
01:44:31,675 --> 01:44:35,286
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll probably do it again and maybe I can go the next time.

1219
01:44:35,306 --> 01:44:36,309
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be lovely.

1220
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:38,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wish this nothing but success.

1221
01:44:39,077 --> 01:44:45,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those that can go, please take pictures of the merch and let me know what I can send you money for.

1222
01:44:45,256 --> 01:44:45,617
All right.

1223
01:44:47,099 --> 01:44:54,248
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that concert last night, the Final Fantasy thing, the merch line, unreal.

1224
01:44:54,268 --> 01:44:56,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Half the venue was in line for merch.

1225
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:56,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I shit you not.

1226
01:44:56,932 --> 01:45:00,276
[SPEAKER_08]: They were selling, I think, a bunch of vinyls that I saw a ton of people.

1227
01:45:00,316 --> 01:45:05,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if maybe it was the first time some of them were on sale, but I swear I saw a ton of people walking out of that merch line with vinyls.

1228
01:45:07,104 --> 01:45:10,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, speaking of which, did I tell you what arrived a month ago?

1229
01:45:10,309 --> 01:45:11,470
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1230
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:41,507
[SPEAKER_08]: my N7 four disc four record collection for Mass Effect oh that's fun the box set I never got into the vinyl thing but I kind of feel like I want to I have a bunch and I haven't hooked up my record player yet I want to get one of those like my parents used to have the shelf that had the record player built into it I'd love to get one of those like old school like a console yeah yeah like from the 70s type of thing I'd love that thrift stores maybe maybe

1231
01:45:41,656 --> 01:46:07,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly would like one that uses glass transistors that'd be fun alright we got another story here before we get to the classic game and it has to do with another let's shit on Xbox story and I'm not intending to do this but it's just again there's a lot of yeah exactly this is what people are talking about this week the new spiritual successor to Pixel Poops it's X Shit

1232
01:46:07,508 --> 01:46:18,158
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the designers from the Doom series, Sandy Peterson, coming out on Twitter to talk about, I should call it X because Twitter is dead.

1233
01:46:18,978 --> 01:46:34,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Sandy Peterson came out on X and said that Ensemble Studios, where he worked into 2000s, apparently Ensemble and the Halo MMO were scrapped by Don Matrick, who was the head of the Xbox at the time.

1234
01:46:34,572 --> 01:46:37,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And we all know he was a terrible boss for Microsoft.

1235
01:46:37,495 --> 01:46:42,970
[SPEAKER_08]: and he said in 2008 Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe.

1236
01:46:43,451 --> 01:46:45,176
[SPEAKER_08]: We codenamed it Titan.

1237
01:46:45,196 --> 01:46:47,342
[SPEAKER_08]: It was to take place tens of thousands a year.

1238
01:46:47,683 --> 01:46:49,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does everybody call their MMO Titan?

1239
01:46:49,729 --> 01:46:51,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say why Blizzard did the same fucking thing.

1240
01:46:51,193 --> 01:46:52,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop calling your cancelled MMOs Titan.

1241
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:54,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we codenamed it Titan.

1242
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:00,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago before the Halos were set off and destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.

1243
01:47:01,033 --> 01:47:10,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it goes on and on and said the lowest estimate we and Microsoft had for the game's total income was $1.1 billion.

1244
01:47:11,785 --> 01:47:16,950
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently, Dom Matric came in and canceled it.

1245
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:25,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all brought to naught when Dom Matric realized that his stock bonus was based on the income Microsoft had from games in three years.

1246
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,384
[SPEAKER_08]: You see, we estimated three and a half years to finish Titan if we did it right.

1247
01:47:30,885 --> 01:47:32,887
[SPEAKER_08]: That's beyond Matric's drop-dead date.

1248
01:47:33,247 --> 01:47:40,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So by firing all of Ensemble, he didn't have to pay for our expensive studio for three years, and he didn't care about Titan.

1249
01:47:40,895 --> 01:47:45,363
[SPEAKER_08]: All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made.

1250
01:47:45,944 --> 01:47:52,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe he did justice to Microsoft stockholders, but hey, Don started as an EA hatchet man, so what would you expect?

1251
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:53,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yikes!

1252
01:47:54,619 --> 01:48:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we were to bring out the wield of plausibility, do we believe that Don Matrick would make a dumbass decision like this?

1253
01:48:01,111 --> 01:48:01,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do.

1254
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:09,940
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's one of those things that just goes to, you know, and maybe other people would look at it and go, well, he got the stock bonus.

1255
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,183
[SPEAKER_08]: So was it a bad decision or was it a smart one?

1256
01:48:13,203 --> 01:48:18,569
[SPEAKER_08]: To which I say, shut the fuck up.

1257
01:48:18,589 --> 01:48:22,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's go back to a simpler time with our next segment.

1258
01:48:22,733 --> 01:48:26,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go back to an era well before stock bonuses, at least I think they were.

1259
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:44,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1260
01:48:45,418 --> 01:48:48,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1261
01:48:48,604 --> 01:48:53,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And apologies, a little bit of the loud noise from said game making its way out over the stream there.

1262
01:48:53,933 --> 01:48:56,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But what did you pick tonight, DarkSakura, for the classic game?

1263
01:48:56,680 --> 01:49:03,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked a game that is more colloquially known outside of Japan as Gourmet Warriors.

1264
01:49:04,139 --> 01:49:12,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Its actual name is Bishoku Sentai Barayaro, which is Rose Rascal's Gourmet Squadron.

1265
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:17,008
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a side-scrolling beat-em-up.

1266
01:49:17,028 --> 01:49:22,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It was developed by WINS and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995.

1267
01:49:22,219 --> 01:49:24,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Japanese-only release.

1268
01:49:27,288 --> 01:49:31,176
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into the re-release about it a little bit later.

1269
01:49:31,156 --> 01:50:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's basically it's just like a total lampoon on Sentai the Sentai genre so you have five stages with a time limit and you lose you basically have to go through and pick up ingredients and each of these stages you lose all of your ingredients when the timer reaches zero but you have multiple lives so you can just

1270
01:50:00,232 --> 01:50:03,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if the character dies, it's an automatic game over.

1271
01:50:05,178 --> 01:50:15,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to focus on the time limit if you want to recuperate your strength after fighting the final boss.

1272
01:50:15,912 --> 01:50:24,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have a button in the game that makes the character do sentai poses when held down and used with a directional pad.

1273
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:26,485
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just there for flex.

1274
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:27,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

1275
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:45,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically in the year 20XDX, you have a city known as Zeus Heaven Magic City, recovered after World War III, and the inhabitants have to ingest protein in whatever food they can find.

1276
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:55,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is an organization called Bath that basically is just constantly expanding corporate, you know,

1277
01:50:55,058 --> 01:51:07,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1278
01:51:09,368 --> 01:51:28,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that their names are just like we have.

1279
01:51:29,856 --> 01:51:30,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

1280
01:51:30,196 --> 01:51:30,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

1281
01:51:31,137 --> 01:51:32,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Ma'am.

1282
01:51:33,621 --> 01:51:34,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Very Good.

1283
01:51:35,264 --> 01:51:36,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are their names.

1284
01:51:38,248 --> 01:51:40,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien.

1285
01:51:41,534 --> 01:51:43,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

1286
01:51:45,901 --> 01:51:51,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Retro Gamer gave it a 79% saying that one should at least play it once.

1287
01:51:51,409 --> 01:51:56,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Their quote is, if you can stomach Chowai Nikki or enjoy it, then this might be right up your alley.

1288
01:51:57,659 --> 01:51:58,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1289
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:00,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a silly one.

1290
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:04,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's hilarious.

1291
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:11,329
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got re-released on January 30th, 2018, Blaze Pro Pico Interactive.

1292
01:52:11,349 --> 01:52:19,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, Pico, created and published a US SNES cartridge with a full English translation called Gourmet Warriors.

1293
01:52:21,526 --> 01:52:43,433
[SPEAKER_08]: so there you go that's the game there's not much else to it I have to admit not not a game I think I ever have seen somehow but um very very much of that you know Final Fight clone era uh but kind of yeah I'd check this out there's always beat-em-ups where are you getting new beat-em-ups now based on old things yeah that's true that's true so

1294
01:52:43,733 --> 01:52:45,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

1295
01:52:45,155 --> 01:52:53,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just think that the cover is absolute fan service because Mademoiselle there is very busty.

1296
01:52:53,965 --> 01:52:56,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Boobalicious?

1297
01:52:56,288 --> 01:52:57,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Busty.

1298
01:52:57,049 --> 01:52:58,090
[SPEAKER_02]: She's busting out.

1299
01:52:58,330 --> 01:52:59,371
[SPEAKER_07]: It's armor.

1300
01:52:59,431 --> 01:53:00,352
[SPEAKER_07]: She's highly armored.

1301
01:53:00,653 --> 01:53:02,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Her boobs are not armored.

1302
01:53:03,476 --> 01:53:05,679
[SPEAKER_02]: The most protected part of her boobs are the nips.

1303
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:06,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1304
01:53:07,621 --> 01:53:12,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's cover a couple other quick topics here in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1305
01:53:12,366 --> 01:53:12,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1306
01:53:13,822 --> 01:53:19,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so Limited Run Games is having their 10th anniversary.

1307
01:53:19,505 --> 01:53:21,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Has it really been that long?

1308
01:53:21,449 --> 01:53:49,853
[SPEAKER_07]: and they've done a lot of announcements of Switch games coming out so starting off we have Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny coming out next year Little Goody Two Shoes Turbo Overkill Jay and Silent Bob's Chronic Blunt Punch Xenotilt Hostile Pinball Action that's a cool name TMNT Tactical Takedown Bad Cheese

1309
01:53:50,373 --> 01:54:13,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I love these names, Fuga Melodies of Steel 1 and 2 and 3 coming next year, Fear Effect 2, Retro Helix, Choa Aineke Collection, Valiant Hearts, Coming Home, Double Shake, Slam City with Scottie Pippen, Respect Edition, Broken Reality,

1310
01:54:13,357 --> 01:54:38,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Renane, Lil Samson, Arrow the Acrobat Collection, Ernest Evans Collection, Sigma Star Saga DX, Shantae, it's a brand new game, Keyman and the Masters of the Universe, Dragon Pearl of Destruction, I think that's a beat-em-up game too, which sounds awesome, Capcom, Arcade Stadium is also coming out, 2026.

1311
01:54:39,253 --> 01:54:40,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of physical releases.

1312
01:54:42,027 --> 01:54:43,509
[SPEAKER_07]: that unfortunately I probably won't buy.

1313
01:54:43,529 --> 01:54:45,211
[SPEAKER_08]: There was something really interesting I was seeing.

1314
01:54:45,231 --> 01:55:00,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Dark Tetsuya posted it to Blue Sky, but apparently something about how the Little Samson, like the way that they're releasing it has to do with like trademark abandonment in Japan is like how they were able to actually make that happen.

1315
01:55:00,311 --> 01:55:09,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to actually pull up his feed to see if I can find that originally skeet on that.

1316
01:55:09,989 --> 01:55:16,118
[SPEAKER_08]: but of course now I can't find it I hate that term so much sorry about that um

1317
01:55:16,182 --> 01:55:17,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here it is.

1318
01:55:17,464 --> 01:55:18,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Note to the legals.

1319
01:55:18,686 --> 01:55:21,490
[SPEAKER_08]: LRG using Japan's arbitration system.

1320
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:24,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is a post from All City Slop Shop.

1321
01:55:25,495 --> 01:55:26,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Note to the legals.

1322
01:55:26,377 --> 01:55:31,804
[SPEAKER_08]: LRG is using Japan's arbitration system for orphaned games to reissue Little Samson.

1323
01:55:31,824 --> 01:55:42,139
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can demonstrate that you've made a genuine effort to contact or identify a potential rights owner to no avail, you can legally commercialize an old game by paying royalties to the Japanese government.

1324
01:55:43,182 --> 01:55:46,066
[SPEAKER_08]: and apparently that is how Little Samson is happening.

1325
01:55:46,086 --> 01:55:48,510
[SPEAKER_08]: To which I say, Guardian Legend wins.

1326
01:55:48,530 --> 01:55:50,693
[SPEAKER_08]: How many royalties do you have to pay for Guardian Legends?

1327
01:55:50,713 --> 01:55:51,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, exactly.

1328
01:55:51,854 --> 01:55:53,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Dark Tootsie posted President Cat.

1329
01:55:54,118 --> 01:55:58,364
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think there was a tie into a TV thing with that particular game.

1330
01:55:58,504 --> 01:56:01,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So that one's going to be a lot harder.

1331
01:56:01,068 --> 01:56:02,710
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's kind of neat.

1332
01:56:03,382 --> 01:56:05,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I have President Cat on my portable emulation device.

1333
01:56:06,766 --> 01:56:06,967
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1334
01:56:06,987 --> 01:56:08,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, what else do you have in the news front, Loki?

1335
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:10,031
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1336
01:56:10,251 --> 01:56:15,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And then along with that, we have a Call of Duty movie coming.

1337
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:17,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1338
01:56:19,103 --> 01:56:24,470
[SPEAKER_07]: They're being written by the writers from Yellowstone and Friday Night Lights.

1339
01:56:26,212 --> 01:56:28,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, I can see the demo now.

1340
01:56:28,856 --> 01:56:28,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1341
01:56:30,518 --> 01:56:31,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1342
01:56:32,727 --> 01:56:34,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can't wait to not see that movie.

1343
01:56:34,614 --> 01:56:35,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1344
01:56:36,924 --> 01:56:39,092
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1345
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:53,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a code for the Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight for Saturn, also known, it was the Castlevania Cynthia Knight version, the one that I just finished playing through.

1346
01:56:54,813 --> 01:56:57,515
[SPEAKER_02]: It has kind of an Easter egg now.

1347
01:56:57,795 --> 01:57:04,501
[SPEAKER_02]: It's escaped notice for years, but if you enter your name in as staff, you get right to the credit.

1348
01:57:04,521 --> 01:57:08,725
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe any percent speed run, shenanigans?

1349
01:57:10,865 --> 01:57:13,449
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1350
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:20,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And as mentioned in the intro to tonight's show by Jason, a little tribute there to Mauro Farina.

1351
01:57:20,120 --> 01:57:21,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope I said that right.

1352
01:57:21,582 --> 01:57:27,812
[SPEAKER_08]: A really large name in Italian Eurobeat and Eurodance scene who was a producer there.

1353
01:57:28,413 --> 01:57:30,416
[SPEAKER_08]: He did pass away this week at the age of 68.

1354
01:57:30,517 --> 01:57:32,620
[SPEAKER_08]: If you actually look up his book,

1355
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:37,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Bio, or just search like RemiWiki for some of the things he's contributed to.

1356
01:57:37,545 --> 01:57:48,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Boom Boom Dollar, The Red Monster Mix, Upside Down, which was... So he released a lot of things under pseudonyms, just like a lot of people that worked on the old DDR did back in the day.

1357
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,841
[SPEAKER_08]: You Leave Me Alone, he had a credit on that.

1358
01:57:52,822 --> 01:57:56,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So he had a lot to do with the old DDR series.

1359
01:57:56,286 --> 01:57:59,890

[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I just loved it.

1436
02:04:33,224 --> 02:04:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I not say?

1437
02:04:33,905 --> 02:04:37,370
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just loved that there's a game called I Hate This Place.

1438
02:04:37,390 --> 02:04:38,472
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the place?

1439
02:04:39,774 --> 02:04:40,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly?

1440
02:04:40,775 --> 02:04:42,738

[SPEAKER_02]: This is a UK release, though.

1442
02:04:47,144 --> 02:04:49,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It could still be somebody's on a trip over here.

1443
02:04:49,528 --> 02:04:50,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate this place.

1444
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:51,110
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1445
02:04:51,611 --> 02:04:55,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, just one other quick story for you before we get to the listener roundtable tonight.

1446
02:04:55,797 --> 02:04:58,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki definitely thought of you when I saw this headline.

1447
02:04:58,461 --> 02:04:59,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't imagine why.

1448
02:05:00,361 --> 02:05:29,760
[SPEAKER_07]: hmm uh yeah so apparently the the thing that we could have had a Kojima Matrix game uh the Wachowskis did approach uh Hideo Kojima on the possibility of making a Matrix game back in the late 90s um unfortunately Konami being Konami at the time said nope

1449
02:05:30,382 --> 02:05:32,325
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do it.

1450
02:05:32,345 --> 02:05:34,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's annoying.

1451
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:41,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so they were shut down by the higher ups at Konami, the vice president of licensing at Konami Digital.

1452
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:43,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about screwing up.

1453
02:05:43,624 --> 02:05:47,691
[SPEAKER_08]: This would have been right in the beginning of that era where Konami really didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

1454
02:05:47,972 --> 02:05:49,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's too bad.

1455
02:05:50,456 --> 02:05:52,119
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put it all on Patchy Slot.

1456
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:54,162
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, though.

1457
02:05:55,087 --> 02:05:58,352
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying it's not too late.

1458
02:05:58,713 --> 02:06:00,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not too late to do it.

1459
02:06:00,395 --> 02:06:00,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It isn't.

1460
02:06:00,876 --> 02:06:01,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

1461
02:06:01,697 --> 02:06:02,399
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1462
02:06:02,759 --> 02:06:07,907
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's the game he wants to make, I actually would be super curious about that.

1463
02:06:09,470 --> 02:06:12,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see it.

1464
02:06:12,715 --> 02:06:13,416
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not too late.

1465
02:06:13,717 --> 02:06:20,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Listener Roundtable, we're going to take your calls over at our Discord server, vognetwork.com.

1466
02:06:21,047 --> 02:06:29,499
[SPEAKER_08]: If you all want to stay in touch after the 23rd as well, Discord is going to be a great place to do it and any of our future projects will certainly be promoted over there.

1467
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:31,702
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG Network is continuing as well.

1468
02:06:31,803 --> 02:06:36,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby Blackwolf is still going to be there and whatever else is cooked up by us in the future.

1469
02:06:36,329 --> 02:06:54,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And one email.

1470
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll get to that too.

1471
02:06:55,865 --> 02:07:02,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranmari sent us a tweet saying that they got the Street Fighter burgers and actually sent a picture.

1472
02:07:02,484 --> 02:07:04,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I was like, oh, those do look kind of good.

1473
02:07:04,309 --> 02:07:06,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is McDonald's better than it is?

1474
02:07:06,916 --> 02:07:07,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1475
02:07:07,879 --> 02:07:09,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1476
02:07:08,982 --> 02:07:16,131
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkDeadSea, talking about our last episode, sent us a message saying, I was catching up on last week's show on this Tuesday evening.

1477
02:07:16,151 --> 02:07:18,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Exorbitant thank you to Rob for mentioning my situation.

1478
02:07:18,654 --> 02:07:21,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a pretty rough October for us then to have that fall into my lap.

1479
02:07:21,658 --> 02:07:22,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not fun.

1480
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:27,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up on the medical stuff if you are able, which I think is a very good life lesson for everybody.

1481
02:07:27,866 --> 02:07:30,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If something doesn't feel right, it's probably not right.

1482
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:34,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least talk to a teledoctor.

1483
02:07:34,855 --> 02:07:37,639
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, go into the office and be seen by one once in a while.

1484
02:07:37,619 --> 02:07:46,231
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mish followed that up saying, you haven't got a clue about, I think this was a few days later, but I'll read it anyway because it's adorable.

1485
02:07:46,311 --> 02:07:49,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Mish said, you haven't got a clue about how much I love him, do you?

1486
02:07:50,036 --> 02:07:54,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll be forever grateful to at Orange Launch Radio for helping us find each other.

1487
02:07:54,682 --> 02:08:03,754
[SPEAKER_08]: We may never officially get married, but as my mother says, legalities aside, we are already married and it's till death do us part from here on out.

1488
02:08:03,774 --> 02:08:05,196
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I'm concerned, Mish,

1489
02:08:05,176 --> 02:08:09,721
[SPEAKER_08]: If you say you're married and he says he's married, if the two parties say they're married, they're married.

1490
02:08:09,741 --> 02:08:18,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is coming from somebody whose marriage is back up for debate in this country and could possibly in the next few years no longer be legally married at the national level.

1491
02:08:19,052 --> 02:08:28,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I might be in a similar... I realize our situations are very different, but it's one of those things where it's like...

1492
02:08:28,042 --> 02:08:34,552
[SPEAKER_08]: The government is not going to tell me how to feel about the guy I've been with for over 15 years.

1493
02:08:35,233 --> 02:08:36,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And y'all know how I feel about that.

1494
02:08:36,816 --> 02:08:37,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to say nothing else.

1495
02:08:38,358 --> 02:08:41,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Mish, you're as good as married to me.

1496
02:08:43,406 --> 02:08:45,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck what the government says.

1497
02:08:45,530 --> 02:08:49,476
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not getting a lot of things correct lately, so we don't care what they think.

1498
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:52,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see.

1499
02:08:52,142 --> 02:08:56,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby in chat did some research on I Hate This Place.

1500
02:08:56,206 --> 02:08:58,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it is a survival horror game.

1501
02:08:58,809 --> 02:09:03,334
[SPEAKER_08]: The place is a creepy ranch at night that you're trying to survive.

1502
02:09:04,356 --> 02:09:08,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bobby says they greenlit a new Matrix movie without the Wachowski sisters.

1503
02:09:08,620 --> 02:09:09,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that true?

1504
02:09:10,382 --> 02:09:11,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be surprised.

1505
02:09:11,223 --> 02:09:14,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think there was a new Matrix movie coming out.

1506
02:09:14,549 --> 02:09:15,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be something.

1507
02:09:15,651 --> 02:09:16,212
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1508
02:09:16,232 --> 02:09:17,134
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a call in the green room.

1509
02:09:17,154 --> 02:09:17,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to get to it.

1510
02:09:18,036 --> 02:09:21,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's bring them on into our broadcast room.

1511
02:09:21,062 --> 02:09:22,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1512
02:09:22,244 --> 02:09:22,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1513
02:09:24,188 --> 02:09:25,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is AJ Twist.

1514
02:09:26,072 --> 02:09:27,315
[SPEAKER_08]: AJ, it's been a while.

1515
02:09:27,355 --> 02:09:29,359
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, my friend?

1516
02:09:29,379 --> 02:09:30,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty well.

1517
02:09:30,621 --> 02:09:31,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1518
02:09:31,182 --> 02:09:31,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to hear from you.

1519
02:09:32,707 --> 02:09:33,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

1520
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:37,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm calling in to kind of make a confession.

1521
02:09:38,102 --> 02:09:38,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1522
02:09:39,164 --> 02:09:48,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll start off by saying, since you guys will be ending the show soon, I started listening to you guys way back in the To Go edition.

1523
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:54,801
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a while ago.

1524
02:09:54,841 --> 02:10:12,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that like 06, 07?

1525
02:10:13,156 --> 02:10:14,678
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?

1526
02:10:14,758 --> 02:10:27,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfocused Podcasts How long have you been doing it?

1527
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:38,775
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like my life

1528
02:10:39,683 --> 02:10:40,464
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our life too.

1529
02:10:41,826 --> 02:10:43,528
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been doing it?

1530
02:10:43,548 --> 02:10:46,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so unfocused that we're currently on hiatus right now.

1531
02:10:46,811 --> 02:10:47,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if we'll come back.

1532
02:10:47,913 --> 02:10:50,436
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on a hiatus for like about three years now.

1533
02:10:50,456 --> 02:10:51,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two or three years now.

1534
02:10:52,658 --> 02:10:54,360
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done that before once too.

1535
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:57,143
[SPEAKER_00]: We took like a one or two year break at one point as well.

1536
02:10:57,164 --> 02:10:58,585
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just life stuff happens.

1537
02:10:58,645 --> 02:11:01,348
[SPEAKER_00]: My co-host started a family.

1538
02:11:01,429 --> 02:11:02,750
[SPEAKER_00]: He has like two kids right now.

1539
02:11:02,850 --> 02:11:05,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of taking a break because of that.

1540
02:11:05,653 --> 02:11:09,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've gone like, I think we started in 2008.

1541
02:11:09,518 --> 02:11:09,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1542
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:11,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when we started ours.

1543
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,443
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we went like 300 episodes deep.

1544
02:11:15,463 --> 02:11:15,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for you.

1545
02:11:16,865 --> 02:11:19,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And that really is, thank you for saying that.

1546
02:11:19,647 --> 02:11:27,654
[SPEAKER_08]: That really is one of the absolute nicest compliments we can get over the years is that somebody says, I was inspired to do my own thing.

1547
02:11:28,115 --> 02:11:30,817
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a weird way of looking at it.

1548
02:11:30,837 --> 02:11:31,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take this the wrong way, AJ.

1549
02:11:32,459 --> 02:11:34,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a weird way of looking at it, admittedly.

1550
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think about all these children that we have.

1551
02:11:36,883 --> 02:11:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And so many children we don't even know about.

1552
02:11:39,505 --> 02:11:40,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mamoru.

1553
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,794
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly the joke I wanted to make, too.

1554
02:11:44,817 --> 02:11:50,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, you know how people, you know, sleep around, come around 18 years later.

1555
02:11:50,449 --> 02:11:53,616
[SPEAKER_08]: All I had to do was whisper some things in your ear.

1556
02:11:55,520 --> 02:12:01,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Omelette du Fromage It is quite the compliment.

1557
02:12:01,075 --> 02:12:02,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It really truly is.

1558
02:12:02,118 --> 02:12:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for saying that.

1559
02:12:03,322 --> 02:12:10,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's other shows I know Anime Jam Session has said openly they were inspired by part by what we were doing here.

1560
02:12:10,943 --> 02:12:12,565
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still going.

1561
02:12:12,585 --> 02:12:15,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, DarkSakura has been talking about a successor project.

1562
02:12:16,129 --> 02:12:19,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's, you know, there's plenty of kids out there.

1563
02:12:19,773 --> 02:12:30,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And so hopefully that sense of like, don't be an asshole to people on the internet and get all the voices in the room and hear some different perspectives and listen to some things in different ways.

1564
02:12:31,225 --> 02:12:34,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully a lot of that kind of carries on from this.

1565
02:12:34,529 --> 02:12:37,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's just, it's...

1566
02:12:37,252 --> 02:12:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of awesome people that listen to this show, and I'm really happy to hear that many of them are taking it forward in their own ways.

1567
02:12:44,783 --> 02:12:47,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that really truly is the nicest compliment, so thank you.

1568
02:12:49,110 --> 02:12:57,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then hopefully, I mean, yeah, I would like to get back and do some more shows again once my co-host can find some time again.

1569
02:12:58,003 --> 02:13:02,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially now since you guys are leaving, it's like, okay, where am I going to get my news from?

1570
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:04,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to start doing my own news again.

1571
02:13:05,113 --> 02:13:06,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing something, huh?

1572
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, we'll see what comes out then.

1573
02:13:11,104 --> 02:13:12,325
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll check that out for sure, though.

1574
02:13:14,287 --> 02:13:16,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask, too, a couple things.

1575
02:13:16,549 --> 02:13:21,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, because I remember when we first started our podcast, it was so jank.

1576
02:13:21,754 --> 02:13:24,517
[SPEAKER_00]: We were literally using Rock Band.

1577
02:13:24,537 --> 02:13:25,678
[SPEAKER_08]: This one still is.

1578
02:13:25,778 --> 02:13:28,501
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you talking about?

1579
02:13:28,521 --> 02:13:31,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I was using a headset I stole from my old job.

1580
02:13:32,745 --> 02:13:36,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what kind of equipment did you guys have in the first few episodes?

1581
02:13:36,297 --> 02:13:39,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a Plantronics call center headset.

1582
02:13:40,963 --> 02:13:51,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a cheap-ass Radio Shack mic, which was like a $10 mic, which probably was just an exposed wire, like literally in a plastic case.

1583
02:13:51,778 --> 02:14:01,090
[SPEAKER_08]: If you actually go back and listen to that first episode, so something about OLR's history that not everybody knows, Loki made himself a co-host on this show by showing up every episode.

1584
02:14:01,130 --> 02:14:02,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm so thankful.

1585
02:14:02,372 --> 02:14:03,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't have had it any other way.

1586
02:14:03,854 --> 02:14:11,843
[SPEAKER_08]: If you go back to that first episode and listen to Loki's comments, he literally sounds like he's talking into a tin can, and it's because he is.

1587
02:14:11,863 --> 02:14:14,306
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a real shit microphone that he was using.

1588
02:14:14,746 --> 02:14:19,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say I was also using one of the headsets, because I believe that's how we were running it.

1589
02:14:19,892 --> 02:14:32,646
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura and I used headsets, and then all the guests that were in the room would use this little... We had a microphone that I would say you could walk up to, but literally it was sitting on the edge of the unused fireplace.

1590
02:14:32,626 --> 02:14:57,402
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1591
02:14:57,382 --> 02:15:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1592
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:57,122
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think also brings me back to kind of like my main point which is so many people out there that want to get into podcasting get so focused on having the right equipment and yes it helps it's necessary you want to be able to sound good you know it will turn people off if you're hard to hear you have volume issues and things like that but I will say this do not let it stop you from creating because it is far harder

1593
02:15:57,102 --> 02:16:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: to have the discipline to keep it going week after week.

1594
02:16:00,587 --> 02:16:02,910
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to make it a habit for yourself.

1595
02:16:03,511 --> 02:16:05,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the only way you're going to be able to stick with it.

1596
02:16:05,414 --> 02:16:16,309
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only way we've been able to do this for as long as we have is to be able to say like every Sunday night is OLR time and have that for 23 years and have that set into our routine.

1597
02:16:16,289 --> 02:16:45,891
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1598
02:16:45,871 --> 02:16:52,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had rock band microphones and we plugged in two of them into our computer that was barely running at the time.

1599
02:16:52,689 --> 02:17:02,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember listening back to it and there was desync issues between the mics and I had to go do a lot of editing in there to just fix it, make it sound good because...

1600
02:17:02,375 --> 02:17:25,378
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1601
02:17:25,358 --> 02:17:27,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, in my technical mind, I was like, it's rough.

1602
02:17:28,081 --> 02:17:30,404
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was like, actually, this is kind of funny.

1603
02:17:30,985 --> 02:17:35,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we were actually kind of on it, like, in the very beginning.

1604
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:37,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun to go back and listen.

1605
02:17:39,494 --> 02:17:40,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1606
02:17:40,275 --> 02:17:45,602
[SPEAKER_00]: My other question, too, for you guys was about DDR, because you guys came from the DDR days.

1607
02:17:46,162 --> 02:17:47,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of missed that boat.

1608
02:17:47,444 --> 02:17:50,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got on the boat, like, right when it was shipping out.

1609
02:17:50,968 --> 02:17:52,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got in late.

1610
02:17:52,630 --> 02:17:54,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never saw any tournaments before.

1611
02:17:54,552 --> 02:17:58,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you guys remember what I've come through and talked about, but I go to like tournaments.

1612
02:17:58,819 --> 02:18:02,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to like fighting games tournaments, like GC, EVO, all that.

1613
02:18:02,625 --> 02:18:04,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen bracket style tournaments.

1614
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:06,972
[SPEAKER_00]: What were DDR tournaments like?

1615
02:18:07,013 --> 02:18:07,774
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that run?

1616
02:18:07,814 --> 02:18:09,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, was there brackets?

1617
02:18:09,857 --> 02:18:11,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there, was it just judges?

1618
02:18:11,660 --> 02:18:13,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's freestyles, so you need judges for that.

1619
02:18:14,565 --> 02:18:16,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what were, what were those like?

1620
02:18:16,895 --> 02:18:19,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of them were separated into two categories.

1621
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:28,696
[SPEAKER_08]: You would tip the standard, quote unquote, the boilerplate DDR tournament would have perfect attack that ran during the day and then freestyle competition that started at night.

1622
02:18:29,057 --> 02:18:31,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So perfect attack could kind of be done one of two ways.

1623
02:18:31,922 --> 02:18:34,106
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be competing for a high score.

1624
02:18:34,126 --> 02:18:37,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually I found that tournaments with less entries were going that way.

1625
02:18:37,492 --> 02:18:39,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you play a qualifier song.

1626
02:18:39,656 --> 02:18:42,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say maybe you're...

1627
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:48,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Average setup would be that a qualifier song or sometimes I've even seen ones where you could pick from one of three.

1628
02:18:48,128 --> 02:18:54,517
[SPEAKER_08]: And that qualifier song would place you into the bracket of eight or the bracket of 16, depending on how many participants were doing this thing.

1629
02:18:54,837 --> 02:19:04,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you would go head to head on different songs that were pre selected by people not participating, you know, in envelopes or what have you to compete head to head for a higher score.

1630
02:19:04,550 --> 02:19:09,800
[SPEAKER_08]: The best I ever did in Perfect Attack was I got fourth place in some tournament.

1631
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:15,590
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat somebody big to get there, so it was like, oh, who did that?

1632
02:19:16,171 --> 02:19:18,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But then it was like, I never did that good again.

1633
02:19:19,597 --> 02:19:21,681
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the songs?

1634
02:19:21,661 --> 02:19:44,378
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1635
02:19:45,050 --> 02:20:02,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Paranoia Evolution It wasn't always the hardest songs because sometimes the pop songs with the strange step charts were actually more challenging because you didn't... I think that's how I got...

1636
02:20:02,701 --> 02:20:32,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And now Pink Dinosaur

1637
02:20:33,143 --> 02:20:34,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I was playing when I started?

1638
02:20:35,005 --> 02:20:37,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Xanadu.

1639
02:20:38,069 --> 02:20:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia.

1640
02:20:39,951 --> 02:20:41,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1641
02:20:41,073 --> 02:20:43,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I started with the first mix at home.

1642
02:20:45,638 --> 02:20:49,823
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, then you would have the freestyle at night, and yes, it was judges.

1643
02:20:50,003 --> 02:20:54,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'd enter, and they'd call people up in a random order or whatever, and that whole thing.

1644
02:20:54,889 --> 02:20:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember, because there was a tournament Jamie and I did at Milpitas.

1645
02:20:59,054 --> 02:21:00,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if Loki was there, but Jamie...

1646
02:21:00,616 --> 02:21:04,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there.

1647
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:28,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I was there.

1648
02:21:28,966 --> 02:21:53,978
[SPEAKER_08]: and so we entered freestyle and we did it so Jamie and I entered freestyle obviously we were screen starers which is a terrible thing to do but I feel like I actually feel like we did decent like considering that like we didn't know the note chart and we hadn't practiced beforehand I feel like we got enough baps in on each other with the bat that it was kind of funny for a minute plastic trumpets

1649
02:21:54,008 --> 02:22:00,087
[SPEAKER_08]: for a minute it was funny I'm sure the crowd was annoyed because we weren't a rehearsed routine but I don't care

1650
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:03,962
[SPEAKER_00]: and then an orange badge.

1651
02:22:03,982 --> 02:22:04,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that how Orange Lounge Radio?

1652
02:22:04,884 --> 02:22:06,747
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're talking about it.

1653
02:22:07,007 --> 02:22:07,889
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pre-OLR.

1654
02:22:07,909 --> 02:22:09,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is pre-OLR.

1655
02:22:09,872 --> 02:22:11,194
[SPEAKER_08]: No, funny enough, that is not.

1656
02:22:11,315 --> 02:22:12,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Bat Radio.

1657
02:22:12,396 --> 02:22:13,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It is funny that that came into it.

1658
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:20,430
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the name was because, again, sort of the boilerplate and where we started Under Sedation Live.

1659
02:22:20,490 --> 02:22:24,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Under Sedation is a line from the Time Warp and the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Riff Raff.

1660
02:22:24,417 --> 02:22:54,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge

1661
02:22:54,404 --> 02:23:11,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was a great decision for the time, but it definitely hurt our discoverability factor in the later iTunes era because we were not the show that we may be the oldest show, but we were not the show that decided to call ourselves video game news radio or gaming lounge radio or something like that.

1662
02:23:11,477 --> 02:23:12,639
[SPEAKER_08]: No disrespect to any show.

1663
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:13,762
[SPEAKER_08]: That's I'm just you.

1664
02:23:14,162 --> 02:23:14,944
[SPEAKER_08]: You beat us to it.

1665
02:23:15,385 --> 02:23:16,547
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is what it is.

1666
02:23:16,797 --> 02:23:19,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel the same way with the Unfocused podcast.

1667
02:23:19,882 --> 02:23:20,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that really helped.

1668
02:23:22,386 --> 02:23:23,788
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were unfocused though.

1669
02:23:23,808 --> 02:23:29,617
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not only gaming, but we talked about comics, anime, and just nerd stuff really.

1670
02:23:30,218 --> 02:23:32,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say this.

1671
02:23:32,862 --> 02:23:43,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the reason, I don't think I've ever said this, it's part of the reason I rushed a podcast that went for about 10 episodes, not even that, maybe 7, called Pokestop Podcast.

1672
02:23:43,233 --> 02:23:45,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to do that show with Shane for a hot minute.

1673
02:23:46,517 --> 02:23:55,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I rushed that podcast to a reality fast to get the name Pokestop Podcast as soon as Pokemon Go came out.

1674
02:23:55,947 --> 02:23:57,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that.

1675
02:23:57,369 --> 02:24:08,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember, but I think I contacted you over Twitter and I wanted to be a co-host for a day, but my schedule didn't work out that day.

1676
02:24:08,144 --> 02:24:09,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Bummer, because I probably would have done it.

1677
02:24:09,826 --> 02:24:15,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some fun episodes, but I was not into the mainline games at that time.

1678
02:24:15,935 --> 02:24:19,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And the allure of Pokemon Go kind of wore off for Shane real fast, I think.

1679
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:23,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So unfortunately it did get, but I was, man, we had the name.

1680
02:24:24,449 --> 02:24:48,094
[SPEAKER_08]: so but it is what it is yeah I remember writing a whole like script of what I wanted to talk about too I remember I probably have it in my notes my phone somewhere actually that's awesome well we could still do that episode you know if you have you have two minutes right now I can all right well maybe maybe another time because we got to wrap up tonight's show but anything else on your mind tonight AJ

1681
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,182
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was about it.

1682
02:24:50,202 --> 02:24:58,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to just admit that and just say thank you for all the shows you guys put on over the years, all the great, just the news.

1683
02:24:58,174 --> 02:25:03,942
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find good news shows that you just would like to hear.

1684
02:25:04,343 --> 02:25:06,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Other news shows, they're just so plain.

1685
02:25:06,546 --> 02:25:11,533
[SPEAKER_00]: They just maybe don't give enough, I don't know, like...

1686
02:25:11,513 --> 02:25:39,630
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to other stuff like a fun way of just explaining news again like you guys started off as just friends talking together just you know BSing and just having that vibe as well as the info at the same time which is you know I really vibe with that I used to like just sneak you guys into work too speaking of Platronics headsets I wired my headset that I used to work in my office job way back to my iPod just to listen to you guys too at night when there was no calls coming in oh my gosh

1687
02:25:39,610 --> 02:25:41,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, yeah, just thanks.

1688
02:25:42,096 --> 02:25:45,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear that, and I hear the PSP thing a lot.

1689
02:25:45,465 --> 02:25:55,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Loki building OLR PSP was, like, the best marketing thing that... Well, second to iTunes was the best thing... Well, I'm thinking about it in my mind.

1690
02:25:55,692 --> 02:26:05,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere, iTunes, All Games, and that were all the big moments that this show got more exposure.

1691
02:26:05,806 --> 02:26:09,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And the PSP thing, I hear an awful lot about when this show got discovered.

1692
02:26:09,852 --> 02:26:11,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So kudos to you, Loki.

1693
02:26:11,594 --> 02:26:13,397
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the marketing genius on that one.

1694
02:26:13,647 --> 02:26:15,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how I did it.

1695
02:26:15,268 --> 02:26:17,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't either in retrospect, but good job.

1696
02:26:17,991 --> 02:26:20,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, AJ, thank you so much for calling in.

1697
02:26:20,333 --> 02:26:26,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we don't get a chance to hear from you again before it's all over, I really want to appreciate your words here and what you said.

1698
02:26:26,839 --> 02:26:34,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And thanks for being... I know we don't hear from you all the time, but I appreciate your perspective on what goes on at EVO and the fighting game community and all of that.

1699
02:26:34,986 --> 02:26:36,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Just really appreciate you being part of the fam.

1700
02:26:37,228 --> 02:26:42,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, none of us are dying and we hope to see you in our future projects.

1701
02:26:42,925 --> 02:26:43,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

1702
02:26:43,527 --> 02:26:44,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, guys.

1703
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:45,071
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1704
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:45,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, AJ.

1705
02:26:45,953 --> 02:26:46,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great night.

1706
02:26:46,414 --> 02:26:46,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night.

1707
02:26:47,497 --> 02:26:47,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1708
02:26:47,637 --> 02:26:47,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1709
02:26:49,542 --> 02:26:50,004
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1710
02:26:51,427 --> 02:26:52,590
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1711
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:53,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's do it.

1712
02:26:53,132 --> 02:26:53,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Email.

1713
02:26:54,923 --> 02:26:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR crew.

1714
02:26:56,626 --> 02:26:57,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Rin.

1715
02:26:57,468 --> 02:27:01,555
[SPEAKER_02]: As I write this email, I'm on a Shinkansen train from Nagoya to Tokyo.

1716
02:27:01,656 --> 02:27:02,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're doing well.

1717
02:27:03,239 --> 02:27:08,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I started listening in 2006 after seeing the OLR domain on a tapestry at Fanime.

1718
02:27:08,909 --> 02:27:14,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I distinctly remembered listening during the university orientation downtime as at the time I had just graduated high school.

1719
02:27:15,241 --> 02:27:18,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm 36 and I'm a working-ass adult trademark.

1720
02:27:18,447 --> 02:27:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1721
02:27:37,533 --> 02:27:44,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The most surprising was finding an AXE on Senichimai near Dotonbori.

1722
02:27:44,743 --> 02:27:58,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like your usual metal games and crane game arcades at first, but I was shocked when I went to the third floor and found an entire row of shmups in great condition and with auto-fire buttons to save players from suffering repetitive stress injury.

1723
02:27:58,542 --> 02:28:03,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm disappointed I only discovered this right before I left for Nagoya.

1724
02:28:04,050 --> 02:28:09,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been playing Sega's rhythm games, MaiMai, Chunidham, Ongeki.

1725
02:28:10,098 --> 02:28:16,927
[SPEAKER_02]: They're miles better than Benmani in my honest opinion, both in terms of gameplay style and ease of getting into them.

1726
02:28:17,067 --> 02:28:19,451
[SPEAKER_02]: MaiMai cabinets just started rolling out across the U.S.

1727
02:28:19,511 --> 02:28:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Round 1 branches, and I hope Chunidham follows suit soon.

1728
02:28:24,057 --> 02:28:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the risk of being canceled by American gamers and branded as a traitor to gamers in the West.

1729
02:28:28,563 --> 02:28:36,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some metal games, similar to coin pusher games in the West, particularly Marble Fever, known in the US as Marble Carnival, which is a marble pusher game.

1730
02:28:38,115 --> 02:28:47,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, they're about as deep as you can expect gambling games to be, but ball mazes and contraptions activate my autistic stems, and so does getting big-ass jackpots.

1731
02:28:47,167 --> 02:28:49,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of the same, I'll admit.

1732
02:28:49,049 --> 02:29:06,535
[SPEAKER_02]: it should be noted that metal games technically aren't gambling since the medals you win and use to play can be redeemed for cash or prizes hence why they're called amusement games literally just for a dopamine rush or gambling minus the actual stakes while I can make do without playing them I just look

1733
02:29:06,515 --> 02:29:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like looking at them for their noticeably high quality artwork.

1734
02:29:10,662 --> 02:29:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'm going to enjoy Tokyo for the next week.

1735
02:29:13,246 --> 02:29:16,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to keeping in touch with you folks even after OLR has ended.

1736
02:29:16,792 --> 02:29:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Much love and take care.

1737
02:29:18,395 --> 02:29:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: System Clarity.

1738
02:29:19,577 --> 02:29:20,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Rin Clarity.

1739
02:29:20,419 --> 02:29:21,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Mari Clarity.

1740
02:29:22,428 --> 02:29:25,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for the commitment to stay in touch when it ends.

1741
02:29:26,853 --> 02:29:29,476
[SPEAKER_02]: We always hang out at California Extreme every year.

1742
02:29:29,716 --> 02:29:30,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1743
02:29:31,138 --> 02:29:36,725
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm thankful you're having a great time in Japan.

1744
02:29:36,785 --> 02:29:39,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thankful you came back after all these years too.

1745
02:29:39,127 --> 02:29:49,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's funny because I think every podcaster who's been doing this a long time, I know Bobby, I think I'm stealing this line from Bobby, but says, I have a lot of former listeners.

1746
02:29:49,259 --> 02:30:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: and sometimes that's kind of how it feels here too and that's that's okay that's not a read that's not like it just you know I can think of shows I used to I think of TV shows I used to watch every single week without fail that I don't watch as much of anymore RuPaul's Drag Race great example because I even had a podcast on that with some buddies for a hot minute I don't watch Drag Race anymore it's hard to avoid on social media I kind of see the highlights and stuff but I don't I don't really watch that stuff anymore so um

1747
02:30:15,331 --> 02:30:43,549
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's not that I hate it or anything in fact I love a lot of the talent that comes from that stuff but Survivor I don't watch every week religiously like I used to or like maybe The Simpsons probably for a lot of people like we all used to watch The Simpsons you know for those first couple years not all but you know a lot of us did and now a lot less do or South Park would be another good example of that that used to be like must see TV in the college dorms and then you know I only see what I see on social media so anyway

1748
02:30:43,529 --> 02:30:45,032
[SPEAKER_08]: is a lot of former listeners.

1749
02:30:45,252 --> 02:30:46,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and that's okay.

1750
02:30:46,876 --> 02:30:51,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope, I noticed OG Happy Dude just came into chat going, wait, wait, OLR sending.

1751
02:30:51,365 --> 02:30:55,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sorry, the news is only just now reaching some people.

1752
02:30:55,954 --> 02:30:58,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually sitting here thinking,

1753
02:30:58,615 --> 02:31:10,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably need to do something I don't want to do and log into Twitter just to get the message out to people that maybe have left some time ago and haven't followed us over to Blue Sky or whatever.

1754
02:31:10,453 --> 02:31:21,229
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as it's paining me to say it, I feel like I might need to send a note just so people know they only have a few more chances to catch us in this form until whatever the future may hold.

1755
02:31:21,249 --> 02:31:22,892
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1756
02:31:23,893 --> 02:31:24,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1757
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:26,151
[SPEAKER_08]: What else?

1758
02:31:26,171 --> 02:31:26,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1759
02:31:26,773 --> 02:31:27,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Emails.

1760
02:31:27,133 --> 02:31:30,760
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to send us an email, participate at orangelawntrader.com.

1761
02:31:31,201 --> 02:31:34,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I would highly encourage you to get those emails in in the next two weeks.

1762
02:31:36,371 --> 02:31:41,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Because on the last episode, I don't think we're going to really have the time to read 17 emails.

1763
02:31:42,163 --> 02:31:44,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I think we would get that many.

1764
02:31:44,684 --> 02:31:51,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to make sure that everybody who wants to call in on the last episode has a chance.

1765
02:31:51,862 --> 02:31:57,556
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to put in the two-minute timer, but I would like everybody... I was kind of stewing on it.

1766
02:31:57,576 --> 02:31:58,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, do we want to open the following?

1767
02:31:58,839 --> 02:31:59,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we not?

1768
02:31:59,921 --> 02:32:02,608
[SPEAKER_08]: This really is...

1769
02:32:02,588 --> 02:32:23,770
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1770
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:53,385
[SPEAKER_08]: so long for now goodbye baby tell me why beep beep oh maybe that'll be the thing if there's too many people then we're going to require that you sing your favorite DDR song to get on I'm just kidding but anyway so that's where you know where we're kind of leaning right now so Jamie says she'll read 17 emails if you send them but I would really encourage you to get those I didn't say that well yes you did you said try me you said watch me I said try me I didn't say I would get through all of them

1771
02:32:53,973 --> 02:32:56,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, she'll abbreviate them all.

1772
02:32:56,099 --> 02:32:58,605
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll say, I'm going to read the first word of each of these emails.

1773
02:32:58,625 --> 02:33:00,530
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says, Jamie's the best.

1774
02:33:00,550 --> 02:33:01,934
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says, Jamie's the best.

1775
02:33:01,954 --> 02:33:03,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says, I like Minecraft.

1776
02:33:06,647 --> 02:33:08,151
[SPEAKER_08]: This one says, grow your YouTube.

1777
02:33:08,231 --> 02:33:08,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, spam.

1778
02:33:09,414 --> 02:33:09,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1779
02:33:09,987 --> 02:33:12,170
[SPEAKER_02]: This one says, hey, I checked out OLR.

1780
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:13,452
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you didn't, you fucking liar.

1781
02:33:14,434 --> 02:33:15,675
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to sell us something.

1782
02:33:15,695 --> 02:33:16,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate those.

1783
02:33:16,657 --> 02:33:21,124
[SPEAKER_08]: If you checked out this show, you know you're probably... Yes, and dear.

1784
02:33:21,364 --> 02:33:22,966
[SPEAKER_02]: We're contacting you, dear.

1785
02:33:24,368 --> 02:33:25,510
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1786
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your dear.

1787
02:33:27,318 --> 02:33:32,768
[SPEAKER_08]: OG Happy Dude says, nothing is preventing a 24-hour call-in episode or party.

1788
02:33:32,889 --> 02:33:39,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all are accepting that that night will probably go late, and that's fine.

1789
02:33:39,241 --> 02:33:42,567
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already taken the week off afterwards, so it's all good.

1790
02:33:42,587 --> 02:33:45,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you say you took the next day off, Jamie, that Monday?

1791
02:33:46,471 --> 02:33:49,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember if you said it or not.

1792
02:33:49,855 --> 02:33:54,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably won't, but again, I'm fortunate in that my boss listens to this program.

1793
02:33:54,841 --> 02:34:01,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm on my Zoom calls wearing sunglasses on Monday, I feel like I'll get a little bit of understanding.

1794
02:34:01,269 --> 02:34:07,716
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 hours is a lot, but six maybe.

1795
02:34:09,578 --> 02:34:10,960
[SPEAKER_02]: We could just drink.

1796
02:34:12,745 --> 02:34:22,854
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, I gotta ask, are we doing one last listless, maybe best gaming moments of the last 23 and a half years?

1797
02:34:24,035 --> 02:34:24,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck me.

1798
02:34:24,836 --> 02:34:28,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the last 23 and a half years.

1799
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Since you asked so nicely, maybe we will.

1800
02:34:32,403 --> 02:34:35,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we will bring one of the old games back for one last swing.

1801
02:34:36,307 --> 02:34:39,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do a cage match because we all know it's going to be Sandstorm.

1802
02:34:40,876 --> 02:35:07,221
[SPEAKER_08]: we can't do a cage match because of copyright streaming things on Twitch so unfortunately you're going to have to get that dream I need to stomp out real quick but a listless or a match game we were doing OLR match game before Drag Race was on TV I just want to put that out there it's Holic the ultimate cage match song forever is Holic how about the FUs of the week you don't want me to do an FU

1803
02:35:08,753 --> 02:35:27,977
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm going to admit I have a little bit of feeling I don't voice and yeah alright so last minute stories do we have any last minute stories tonight?

1804
02:35:27,997 --> 02:35:32,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna just completely go off on the entire industry so you don't want me to say anything

1805
02:35:32,851 --> 02:35:36,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I actually have a few things real quick I was going to mention.

1806
02:35:37,621 --> 02:35:39,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a fun one.

1807
02:35:39,444 --> 02:35:44,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that GameStop has their own official game that they're actually selling at GameStop?

1808
02:35:45,356 --> 02:35:45,938
[SPEAKER_02]: How to suck?

1809
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:51,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Buck in the Curse Partridge.

1810
02:35:51,709 --> 02:35:53,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they label this box correctly?

1811
02:35:53,493 --> 02:35:53,593
Pfft.

1812
02:35:54,434 --> 02:36:16,088
[SPEAKER_07]: uh yeah you have the final unwrapped box display boxes that you're gonna sell is new no it's buck remember that stupid rabbit that they have that's like their mascot i guess but they're selling it it's now a game boy color game that someone made for them or they commissioned to have made for them and they sell it at their store so yay um

1813
02:36:16,979 --> 02:36:18,001
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of cool.

1814
02:36:18,081 --> 02:36:25,212
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a mod that was developed for Bully, the old Rockstar game called Bully Online.

1815
02:36:25,372 --> 02:36:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It is exactly what it sounds like.

1816
02:36:27,355 --> 02:36:33,966
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a multiplayer mod for Bully that allows you to play... As if you need a mod to bully people online.

1817
02:36:34,106 --> 02:36:34,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

1818
02:36:34,765 --> 02:36:35,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you can.

1819
02:36:35,987 --> 02:36:45,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so you can do all sorts of roleplay stuff in the bully game, which until it gets shut down by Rockstar, which I believe will happen.

1820
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:54,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they they like to be litigious and also they like to bust unions because apparently that's the other thing that they're doing right now in the UK.

1821
02:36:54,551 --> 02:36:55,272
[SPEAKER_07]: They fired.

1822
02:36:55,252 --> 02:37:23,925
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada that they say they're claiming people were terminated for gross misconduct however also those people happen to be part of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain and this is a basically a way to bust some union so fun fun that's it alrighty

1823
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:28,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, with that, we're going to wrap it up, get some final thoughts.

1824
02:37:28,723 --> 02:37:31,385
[SPEAKER_08]: We were a little long tonight, but I expect these last episodes will be.

1825
02:37:31,925 --> 02:37:47,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually at the end, I talk about spread the word and all that stuff, but ever since we made the announcement, I think I just want to say here, a reminder, our last episode is November 23rd, and we want to thank all of you for being along with us on this journey.

1826
02:37:47,538 --> 02:37:54,064
[SPEAKER_08]: We got into it a little bit on that call tonight, but you guys have been what has made this show a success for as long as it has been.

1827
02:37:54,044 --> 02:38:23,494
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1828
02:38:23,879 --> 02:38:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're just hashing out a couple of things, that's all.

1829
02:38:27,543 --> 02:38:27,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1830
02:38:27,943 --> 02:38:32,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw someone working on something, so I know things are happening.

1831
02:38:33,649 --> 02:38:42,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was also asked a lighting question, so I know that there's things occurring, and that's exciting to see.

1832
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:45,842
[SPEAKER_08]: So I look forward to the children that will be birthed next.

1833
02:38:49,046 --> 02:38:51,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't ask to pay child support.

1834
02:38:51,419 --> 02:38:53,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Children.

1835
02:38:53,301 --> 02:38:54,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like the drunk aunt.

1836
02:38:54,862 --> 02:38:57,444
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1837
02:38:57,545 --> 02:38:58,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Final thoughts.

1838
02:38:58,225 --> 02:38:59,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do them.

1839
02:38:59,146 --> 02:39:00,627
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you're streaming tonight, right?

1840
02:39:00,647 --> 02:39:01,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Final thought.

1841
02:39:01,488 --> 02:39:05,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tonight's Pali and I because, you know, I like to do something chill after the show.

1842
02:39:06,413 --> 02:39:11,457
[SPEAKER_02]: But, man, I have some feelings about Debra Delightful here.

1843
02:39:11,778 --> 02:39:18,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're starting 2v8 again and they're taking out Legion for shame.

1844
02:39:20,039 --> 02:39:48,865
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare they take out my legion Growl Hiss So Pallia happens tonight Have fun with Pallia Yeah Bye kids Bye, see you next time Alright, we'll go over to Loki Your final thought tonight, Loki My final thought is I need to work more on content Because I've been busy with everything else You'll have some extra time in a few weeks

1845
02:39:49,182 --> 02:40:19,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to figure out what to do.

1846
02:40:19,169 --> 02:40:24,515
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I do it all cinematic and it's all scripted, that's kind of a lot of effort.

1847
02:40:24,535 --> 02:40:28,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also want to play it, you know, so I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to do that.

1848
02:40:29,259 --> 02:40:30,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1849
02:40:30,781 --> 02:40:32,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I may just not do it fully scripted.

1850
02:40:33,083 --> 02:40:38,309
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I wanted to do it scripted and cinematic is because I thought that that would get more views.

1851
02:40:38,329 --> 02:40:43,935
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, based off of what my channel's doing right now, I don't know what gets more views.

1852
02:40:43,955 --> 02:40:46,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, that is not working at all.

1853
02:40:47,378 --> 02:40:48,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing to do.

1854
02:40:48,532 --> 02:40:51,880
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll figure it out.

1855
02:40:51,900 --> 02:40:52,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep at it, Loki.

1856
02:40:52,622 --> 02:40:56,009
[SPEAKER_08]: You do good stuff and one of these days you'll be rewarded for that success.

1857
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it.

1858
02:40:57,192 --> 02:40:57,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Someday.

1859
02:40:58,295 --> 02:41:01,883
[SPEAKER_08]: I choose to believe that that is true in my heart.

1860
02:41:02,133 --> 02:41:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my final thought is I see a news article about Civilization 7 scrolling along the bottom of the screen and then I realize I still never played Civilization 7.

1861
02:41:10,064 --> 02:41:11,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I should probably get on that.

1862
02:41:11,546 --> 02:41:12,988
[SPEAKER_08]: But I need to finish Dragon Quest.

1863
02:41:13,088 --> 02:41:15,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing games like a lot lately.

1864
02:41:15,131 --> 02:41:16,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that time of year.

1865
02:41:16,192 --> 02:41:16,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Exciting.
