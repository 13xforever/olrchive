9987	14374	While I was reading the news this week, I didn't understand why there was confusion around Ubisoft's financial situation.
14654	18000	Surely private equity buyouts with unscrupulous fools are going to hit some snags.
18020	23388	Then I realized I was thinking about Electronic Arts, and not the other troublesome warts of the gaming industry, of which there are many.
23408	26053	You can see how I thought of the wrong company here, right?
28396	29598	This is the penultimate intro.
29738	34666	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jimmy Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34686	36990	Starting now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice...
38877	42463	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42623	47851	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47951	50295	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50315	56464	We are live once again with episode number 1069.
57220	59484	Nice.
60145	73947	Nice.
73927	79935	Next week will be OLR, the final, just so that we can actually go out on episode number 1069.
80376	85923	Just to be clear on how that's all going to work because numbers and LOL, I'm 12.
86144	88587	I'm Rob Roberts, your resident 12-year-old.
88607	90970	And joining me as always are my incredible co-hosts.
90990	94676	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
94696	94936	Yo.
95256	95777	Hello, hello.
96017	97960	It was nice to hang IRL this week.
98699	99762	It absolutely was.
99802	100725	I had a great time.
100966	104958	Yeah, so tell the listeners what we did, for those that don't know.
104978	107124	We went to see Clue, and y'all didn't get to go.
107385	108769	My favorite movie of all time.
110273	112219	Just to be clear, my favorite movie of all time.
112672	115055	Up there is one of my favorites.
115075	117359	It's not The Princess Bride, but it's close.
117979	122726	And the thing too, people assume it's because of Rocky Horror and some connection there.
122826	125230	No, I had no idea what Rocky Horror was.
125931	127172	My connection is childhood.
127713	129696	I had Clue on beta.
129956	133161	Yes, I'm that old and that movie is that old, right?
133261	135364	I had Clue on beta when I was seven years old.
135704	140451	And I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you I watched it every single day.
140431	149863	One Summer when I was seven years old because I was just obsessed with Tim Curry's performance in that movie and how like just an incredible actor he is.
149883	152987	So, you know, I always loved that man growing up.
153087	156331	Like Annie was one of my favorite movies and of course he's in that.
156351	162339	And maybe not so much it until I was older and could appreciate that role because it was kind of scary as fuck.
162619	164562	But like everything I saw him in, I just loved him in.
165022	168126	And then Rocky Horror happened and I was like, oh my –
168106	169688	Can this man do anything wrong?
170068	171610	I don't think so.
171630	172731	No, he absolutely can't.
173632	177155	There was a recent interview with him that I saw a clip of on TikTok.
177696	182101	And somebody was trying to ask the question, was there ever a love that got away?
182361	184663	They're basically begging him to come out on camera, right?
184683	186585	But he's maintaining a private life.
187126	192752	And so he speaks a little slower now and a little more intentionally ever since the stroke.
193212	197657	And he says, without skipping a beat, without cracking a smile or anything, he says, Miss Piggy.
198785	203913	And I'm like, I love that man.
203933	204677	I love him.
207323	232639	anyway all right um let's say hello oh god he's a legend he is i'm glad we got to do i'm also glad to hear that our local classic theater the crest we have a few in town because the colonial where i do a lot of shows is a classic to the tower theater which ladybird made famous does a lot of movies too um i that was a fun to do a movie night so um we'll have to we'll have to do that once a month or so i think that'll be a lot of fun depending on what they show but you know they
232838	233439	Oh, yeah.
233459	234780	Seems like they had some pretty good choices coming.
234800	236782	They did Labyrinth earlier this month, which I missed.
237243	238164	Adam's Family Values.
238524	240266	Whoever's picking the movies there is doing a pretty good job.
241007	241607	It's that lady.
242108	242488	Yeah.
242508	243289	Who came out on stage.
243409	244491	Yeah, when I had to go potty.
245291	246693	So I missed most of her shtick.
246713	247494	But yeah, no, it's fine.
248715	248975	All right.
250037	254341	So let's say hello to someone I didn't go on a movie date with this week, but maybe I will in the future.
254381	255803	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
256664	256864	Hello.
256884	259166	Do you want to go see Wicked for Good and Cry Together?
260528	260668	No.
261948	286690	I mean, I'll see it, I'm just like, I don't know, it is alright I've seen Wicked as the play, you know, but I've never seen the stage play, I know of it, I've, you know, kind of heard the soundtrack So what I have learned, and I did a little bit of digging, is that a lot was taken out of the play and a lot more from the book was added back in Yeah, so, yeah Which makes me happy, that's why I'll see it
287075	296273	No, PodCulture, I never... For as long as it previewed at the Orpheum in San Francisco, which is kind of where, you know, I have to go to see a lot of theater, I never got preview tickets.
296293	298097	It was always expensive and full.
298137	303548	Anyway, comments from our chatroom over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, because we do tape live...
303528	307013	Just about every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
307074	311681	I mean, for at least one more week at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
311701	316588	But in all seriousness, DarkSakura has talked about that there will be a successor show coming to OLR.
317370	320835	More details, all the details you need to know next week, right, on that.
320855	322077	So stay tuned for that.
322495	323116	Indeed so.
323356	327743	So you might want to make this time slot a habit.
328384	337537	And of course, with our final show next week on 23 November, of course, we really want you to continue to support all of our shows at the Voice Geeks Network.
337558	342365	I'm taking the rest of the year off to rest, as I badly need to do.
342865	344588	But I will be back.
344568	346870	as an individual contributor to the Voice Geeks Network.
346890	356640	And I'm gonna focus on like YouTubes and TikToks and sort of short video production that works a little more with as I can fit, as I can do them with my schedule sort of thing.
357581	359563	So I'm excited to continue that.
360544	366770	So yeah, please continue to support the Voice Geeks Network even with our show wrapping up next week.
366790	370474	So we hope all of our listeners past and present will be able to join us live.
370854	373697	Again, that's November 23rd for OLR, the final.
373677	377843	Other comments from chat, Mish talking about Tim Curry is saying, wait, he was in Annie?
378263	379245	Wait, who was he?
379265	379786	I forgot.
380286	381027	Yeah, he was Rooster.
381528	383130	He plays Miss Hannigan's brother.
383871	385914	Easy street.
385994	389499	That's the big number that Tim Curry is in.
390120	394006	Which, interesting, there's a whole thing online about it.
394046	399313	They filmed and spent a lot of money on a huge production for that number.
399293	426718	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
427019	431273	Phil of Nine says, don't forget his role in Legend.
431433	433962	Oh, I won't, but I missed that when I was a kid.
434303	436791	Actually, I want to say Jamie showed me that movie.
437754	439881	I will not watch it
439945	440827	Pass a certain point.
441167	442350	Who showed me that movie?
442430	443472	I thought it was you.
443492	446518	Maybe you just turned around during that part or something, but I thought it was you.
446939	448882	I know I have absolutely told you about it.
449363	450526	Yeah, so anyway.
452028	453932	Yeah, Tiger Class says he was in a scary movie too.
453992	456277	Yep, Home Alone 2 as well was a big infamous role.
456317	456738	Yeah, he was.
456898	459523	He was the concierge in Home Alone 2, yeah.
459503	486456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
486436	493898	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
494941	500349	If a rumor we're going to get into later in the show pans out to be true next week, we will absolutely talk about that.
500389	503013	But otherwise, I expect the gaming news to be very light next week.
503033	507700	We're going to make it about us, because after 23 and a half years, we fucking deserve to.
508942	510004	So we'll be doing that.
510024	511886	We'll still touch on a little bit of gaming next week.
511906	518416	But I do want to mention, Loki, playing behind you tonight, ZZT, one of my all-time faves.
518436	519638	This is good.
519658	521120	Have you played ZZT recently, Loki?
522142	522282	No.
523240	547273	is that is that on the Epic Game Store they should really if it's not on the Epic Game Store they should really get it on there I mean yeah I don't think so because I would have bought it if it was on the Epic Game Store yeah you would think you would think tap into that history a little bit so yeah I mean come on like what like what's the uh like anniversary of ZZT by now it's like uh like
548013	550737	That game was out, what, 92 or 93?
551919	554082	Was it high school for me or junior high?
554122	555564	I want to say it was early high school.
555584	557266	It was high school for me.
557887	562333	Yeah, I want to say like 94, 95.
562413	564316	So that game ought to be coming up on 30 years.
564356	566359	Yeah, if it was 95, it would be 30 years old.
566947	584010	DarkSakura,
583990	604530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
605354	608459	Yes, so Valve is releasing more hardware.
609400	612706	They have announced a brand new Steam machine.
613046	616892	It's almost like the Ouya, but actually a functional device.
618074	626788	It is a small little 6x6 cube, and it's got enough hardware to basically...
626768	637324	or enough processing power and GPU power to run most games at 4K 60 FPS with FSR, of course.
637584	639808	The name that Bobby was using was the Gabe Cube.
640048	640629	I love that name.
640869	641530	The Gabe Cube.
641550	642632	The Gabe Cube.
642752	643433	Gabe Cube's good.
643553	646077	It needs a loading screen.
646057	648722	It's got a cool little LED bar.
648862	650825	Honestly, I really like the design of it.
650845	654792	I think it's really cool because consoles are getting huge.
654912	662766	A lot of the PlayStations and stuff like that are pretty large devices, and they have this tiny little device that...
663100	666966	You know, I could actually see that, you know, you put that in your living room or under your TV.
667347	671053	You know, it's got a cool little LED thing on there that you can control different stuff.
671755	673057	I think it's kind of cool.
673417	684396	And then, yeah, right now they're saying that it's got basically either... There's two different versions you can buy, either a 512 gigabyte or 2 terabyte storage capacity version.
684796	689344	Although I believe that, you know, that's all just standard...
689324	706489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
706469	731852	uh yeah and then along with that um they have uh support for you know Steam's brand new controller that they announced as well so there's a new Steam controller looks very similar as far as button layout setup to like a PlayStation controller but it also has the little trackpads below the analog sticks and then there's mappable buttons on the bottom as well or triggers and um
732541	736025	They've also got different feedback as well.
736645	743713	Brand new magnetic thumbsticks that are supposed to be even more responsive and better than the Halifax sticks.
743733	744974	So that's kind of cool.
744995	748558	And finally, a new VR headset, the Steam Frame.
748899	757468	So that is a brand new headset that is along the lines of... I believe they said that it's going to...
757448	773128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
773108	796247	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
796227	797248	So pretty cool.
797769	800874	Problem right now is we don't know any of the prices on any of this stuff.
800914	802997	So that's the only downside.
803417	806682	All this is expected to be out sometime early next year.
806702	808805	So that's pretty exciting though.
808825	810928	Well, there's a lot to digest with all of this, right?
811049	816316	So first off on the price, completely understand why they're not saying the price right now because it's too volatile right now.
816416	819381	It's also a PC and not necessarily like a console.
819401	822185	This is, I mean, you can use this for a PC.
822205	823787	It's just going to...
823767	842417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
842397	870987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
870967	888165	you've got you've got a device let's say this is even let's say is price exactly the same as like a PlayStation 5 or a you know Xbox Series X or whatever let's just say it's it's the same price as that which I think it's still going to be more than that because it's it's a PC but let's just say it's the same
888145	905074	you have access to a library of games which not only just a library games you have access to steam you have access to all the other pc marketplaces out there because you're not just tied down to one thing all in a form factor that is a tiny little box
905054	921763	you've got a controller that feels very familiar with any other consoles out there and the best part about that is hey you know all those Microsoft exclusives and all those Sony exclusives well a lot of those seem to funnel the PC anyway so guess what it doesn't matter because you have both and you have everything else on top of that
921743	933081	That built-in cross-buy is huge because let's say you have a Gabe Cube and you have your PC or even your Macs or your Linux running machine.
933402	935004	You have a Steam Deck.
935064	937288	Cross-buy isn't even a question.
937268	941453	You buy the game, you're going to be able to play it on all of those devices.
941473	945037	That is so smart of Steam's design.
945057	956931	And honestly, if Microsoft does not have cross-buy as the default for everything, including third-party, starting by the end of the year, they're set up for failure.
956951	961236	It's going to make buying on this GameCube a whole lot more compelling.
961256	963158	And on top of that, like...
963138	977063	you can even just like say hey look at this like yeah we are more expensive but guess what you don't gotta pay you don't have to pay monthly to use fucking online to play network play you can just do it it's free like
977785	985134	DJ Ranma S in chat says, even if it undercuts the Xbox Series X, Microsoft will still put out a new console to promote their studios and Game Pass.
985515	993084	Yes, they do have software on other platforms and they have Xbox Gaming on other devices and platforms, but how does that look if they can't show it on their own hardware?
993385	995527	That's why they will always have a new console.
995547	1005700	But the problem is, I get that, and they are committed to putting out a new console, but the problem is, if they can't put it out at a price that's cheaper than this other box, why would anyone buy it?
1005680	1012350	because, you know, other than Microsoft diehard fanboys and fangirls and fanpeople, why on earth would anyone buy it?
1012370	1018359	Because Steam is, and I say this as someone who's had Game Pass for a very long time, almost since the beginning.
1018379	1020662	I've supported the Microsoft ecosystem for a long time.
1020822	1024167	I have seen them over the last couple of years going down the wrong path.
1024187	1026270	They are in trouble, big time.
1026371	1031298	And this whole report about the forced profits they have to be turning is absolutely the wrong direction.
1031578	1032219	And what's going on?
1032259	1035484	There is a lot of anti-Microsoft sentiment out there.
1035464	1035965	A lot.
1036005	1037387	And you know what it boils down to?
1037908	1038329	AI.
1038990	1040132	It boils down to AI.
1040433	1042096	You want co-pilot in your games?
1042456	1043799	Fuck out of here.
1044420	1046503	Stop shoving that shit in our faces.
1046904	1052073	Sure, you can have it as a little icon, and when I want to invoke it, I will.
1052093	1055579	But you've got to stop shoving that everywhere.
1055640	1058164	It's more annoying than Clippy at this point.
1058144	1086902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1086882	1088024	Just in the last couple weeks.
1088685	1092772	The ship is sinking at Microsoft.
1092792	1094375	And I'm sorry to be that gamer.
1094916	1096478	I know a lot of you are fans of Microsoft.
1096618	1097640	I'm rooting for them.
1097660	1098401	I really am.
1098421	1099103	I'm not a hater.
1099143	1099684	I promise.
1100084	1104011	I am just seeing bad executive decision after bad executive decision.
1104472	1108258	And even the diehard Microsoft fans have to admit, take a step back.
1108398	1109961	You're seeing bad decisions too.
1109981	1110662	You know it.
1111992	1119606	If this is the fire Microsoft needs under their butt to make some fucking changes, then I welcome it.
1119626	1122652	Because at the end of the day, I am rooting for Microsoft.
1122672	1124054	I want to see them succeed.
1124074	1127801	They ain't going to succeed down this path.
1127821	1130766	PopCulture says, I thought Loki was the one who does the rants.
1130887	1131448	You know what?
1132590	1135054	I got a few in me before the curtain falls.
1135355	1135435	Yes.
1138368	1141794	Now, SJ100Matt says, I don't think it will undercut it, and I don't think it needs to.
1141814	1143096	I think if it's close, then it will do well.
1143416	1145800	And I think that's a huge, important thing.
1145820	1149787	All of this, if that Gabe Cube is $1,000, forget it.
1150147	1151209	Forget everything I said.
1151329	1151750	Forget it.
1151850	1152812	It's too expensive.
1152832	1153713	Well, it's still a PC.
1153733	1162047	It's not even too expensive at $1,000, I think, actually, because it's a PC, because it's not just a console, and it is something that...
1162027	1165673	True.
1165713	1167175	True.
1167315	1187005	True.
1187272	1194585	I still think you can make the argument though, like even if it's like a couple hundred dollars more, it's like, yeah, but you're not paying for online access.
1194745	1201197	And at that point, it becomes a boutique product and a niche thing, which is still great for a lot of people.
1201217	1205685	But everything I said about, oh, Microsoft's in danger, girl, that's out the window.
1205665	1224518	So what I'm saying is I reserve the right to take back everything I said because the price is that important.
1224498	1242338	Thanks for watching!
1242318	1244944	Oh, JK, JK, you know what?
1245525	1251418	It turns out maybe it was a bad idea to put tariffs on bananas and coffee and meat, whatever the fuck they said.
1251438	1257913	So a lot of things at the grocery store, because remember how the price of groceries was going to come down on day one?
1261505	1263768	and... I did want to pivot real fast.
1263788	1264429	Yeah, okay.
1264449	1265010	Sorry.
1265030	1266352	It's just ever so quickly.
1266372	1268395	Oh, because I got more, so you better hurry.
1269196	1269978	Okay, okay.
1270298	1271780	Sprinkle in a little bit of good news, okay?
1272041	1272261	Okay.
1272341	1276507	So, I finally got... I had to update stupid Epic Games Store.
1277168	1281314	ZZT is on their store and it's free.
1281875	1283277	What?!
1283297	1284719	Okay, that is good news.
1284739	1286201	That is good news.
1286221	1286522	Alright.
1286862	1287644	Rant cancelled.
1287684	1288224	Show over.
1288345	1289146	Go play ZZT.
1289166	1289466	Good night.
1289546	1289687	No.
1290307	1290668	Uh...
1292048	1293914	What else is going to say about politics?
1294215	1295018	Oh, I know.
1295921	1298810	People are going to cringe when I bring this up.
1298891	1299573	I don't give a fuck.
1300195	1302121	I got one put out the door.
1302483	1305332	I'm just going to say it all tonight.
1306139	1310766	The tariffs are completely going to be controlled by this Epstein Files situation.
1310786	1314232	Because the whole reason that the tariffs... Why now?
1314652	1315734	Why are the tariffs going down now?
1315954	1317036	Distraction!
1317056	1317937	Look over here!
1318278	1321042	Look over here, because the Epstein Files, it's all a hoax.
1322044	1325088	All that man can keep saying is it's all a hoax.
1325108	1326190	If it's a hoax...
1327030	1355603	and everybody just needs to keep coming back to the same point which I can't fucking believe Marjorie Taylor Greene of all people you know what, when it's right, it's right and that woman is right on this if there's nothing if it's a hoax then the file should be released let it be shown that it's a hoax let it be out there, let everybody see it what's the problem?
1356832	1362859	But at every fucking opportunity, he's wanting to distract, distract, distract.
1364201	1366003	And all the clues have been there.
1366224	1367485	It's all lined up.
1367785	1369768	What does this have to do with video games?
1369788	1372752	The price of what you're going to pay for a Gabe Cube.
1373112	1377678	That's what the Epstein files have to do with video games.
1377698	1385387	Because if those come out and the house of cards starts tumbling, those tariffs are going to go away one way or another real fast.
1386970	1395839	I mean, not that I really want to see that that's the ending, but unfortunately, I think we all know it's coming.
1396579	1397801	That that man was more involved.
1398001	1411153	That the man who is on tape saying, grab them by the pussy, and the man who is on tape making fun of different abled people in all sorts of forms and stuff, and the man who has said all these brass things.
1411594	1414817	I mean...
1415303	1417787	All I can say is it's on my conscience I didn't vote for him.
1423939	1424640	Video games.
1426223	1426944	But it's true.
1427325	1428487	Somebody agree with me.
1428507	1429468	Somebody agree with me.
1429929	1432895	The Epstein files have everything to do with video games right now.
1433315	1434257	Tell me I'm wrong.
1435250	1439177	I don't think he's going to get rid of tariffs to distract from that.
1439197	1441741	He's just going to do more insane stuff.
1441922	1442964	He just did!
1443084	1447892	The problem, though, is that regardless of whether or not any of us voted for him, we still have to deal with his bullshit.
1448293	1448633	100%.
1448894	1450677	100%.
1452462	1452842	That's true.
1452863	1454324	And SSJ100Matt does have a good point.
1454344	1456127	The court might also fix the tariff thing.
1456207	1457388	Anyway, I'm sorry.
1457408	1460592	I know a lot of you were like, why did you have to go down that road?
1460793	1467281	But I do because this is why things don't make sense anymore.
1467301	1478976	And we just don't get prices up front because nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen tomorrow and what side of the bed Dear Leader wakes up on and decides to start shit somewhere on social media.
1479563	1490823	I mean, honestly, though, if anyone's paying attention to the current state of this creature, I don't know if he's going to make it through the end of next year.
1492106	1497515	Anyway, if it's a hoax, then let the people be the judge.
1498657	1502905	But at every opportunity you're hiding it, the jig is up.
1504775	1529112	anyway um what else uh oh what else oh yes Valve VR oh yes and let's yeah it's a VR yeah that was cool too yeah uh big rumor in that department too right uh yeah well it would yeah so now the other rumor is and it's it's like everyone has to like just go really we're doing this again but yes we're doing it again
1529446	1534891	Apparently, November 19th is the 27th anniversary of Half-Life 1.
1535071	1537753	I think we just had the anniversary of Half-Life 2.
1538834	1543818	And apparently, many leakers are all saying the same thing.
1543838	1544639	Many leakers!
1544739	1545780	Handle it!
1545800	1559031	So, many leakers, one of which is Tyler McVicker, who was the first to leak that Half-Life Alex was a thing, says that there's an announcement coming.
1559011	1580243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1581202	1583929	is because the VR thing.
1583949	1586134	Like, VR, I don't know.
1586535	1594656	And folks are probably going to disagree with me, but I feel like there have not been a lot of compelling reasons to have a VR lately in the past few years.
1595317	1595718	Here and there.
1595758	1598485	Like, you know, Luminous Arise just came out this last week.
1598465	1600228	Oh god, still.
1600389	1615917	Ancient?
1615897	1628995	Even Half-Life Alyx at this point is pretty old There needs to be something new to breathe life into VR and make this device something you have to have to play this game
1629717	1649886	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1650659	1658711	If they're pushing a console system of sorts too, a Half-Life 3, and maybe it's a medium.
1659112	1670689	Maybe Half-Life 3, or whatever it is, ends up being something that is built for flat screens, but has a VR enhancement of some sort that will make people want to have it in VR as well.
1671049	1671570	Like...
1671550	1676498	It makes a really good flagship product for all of these things.
1676578	1682527	And that's why I'm a little more inclined to believe the rumors this time than previously.
1682547	1685231	But we'll see.
1685251	1690840	Either we get to drop this whopper news on our last show or fool me again, Gabe Newell.
1690880	1691701	Fool me again.
1692823	1698351	But it should be noted that they did announce three hardware things.
1699462	1720018	1, 2, 5 3
1721804	1724907	Alright, ushering in new eras is the hot new thing on the block.
1724967	1732815	Alright, let's move on and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1733095	1741403	By the way, I'm loving the facts that S2100Matt's been posting on Blue Sky about the show, but S2100Matt says, OLR has three letters.
1741483	1742364	OLR is ending.
1742685	1744587	Game awards happening three weeks from now.
1744667	1745708	Half-Life 3 confirmed.
1748290	1748951	Alright, anyway.
1749391	1751153	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1752331	1754253	Really, it wasn't the best, and I'll tell you why.
1755454	1758077	I still have that issue going on with my hand.
1760299	1761220	Gaming really hurts.
1761280	1763061	It's gotten so much worse.
1765023	1769688	I have played a lot of Survivor and Dead by Daylight when I can, whenever I go back to Killer.
1771049	1775514	I guess it's because I have my controls, most of my major controls, bound to my mouse.
1776715	1777375	It's just too much.
1778496	1782220	I really can't make it through more than a couple of matches.
1783685	1788033	I've just been farming blood points as survivor, because, I mean, that's it.
1788053	1793383	So anyway, I am also, though, playing a lot of Palia, because I can play that.
1794746	1799194	And I have picked up Date Everything.
1800116	1802601	We're gonna see if that happens.
1802621	1802841	Um...
1804154	1812643	I also am not quite sure what I want to do for a classic game, but Shay gave me an idea to do community games night.
1813104	1816508	So there may be some community games starting on Saturday on my stream.
1816568	1817188	So who knows?
1817849	1820192	But mostly it's just been Palia and the Deborah.
1821573	1821874	All right.
1822935	1826078	Pirate Poundtown does say DVD streams are still fun to watch as a lurker.
1826358	1829902	So I like lurking in those types of streams too.
1830343	1831464	I like to watch.
1831905	1832185	All right.
1832745	1834127	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1834934	1837578	It was basically just Minecraft.
1837958	1842585	I've been still working on getting my modded series ready to go.
1843026	1854362	Also finished and put out a new episode where I made a Minecraft super smelter that makes fart noises because farts are funny.
1854382	1854702	Of course.
1855343	1857446	But it's functional and it works really well.
1857546	1860250	But it also is really funny because it makes lots of fart noises.
1861310	1889241	29 curated fart noises by the way lovely love that for you love that journey all right yes yes um let's see my gaming week um my gaming week was I did I finished off Diablo 4 season 10 like I said I would I've I finished off all the little achievements for the season and all that stuff and that's the first time I've cleared it completely so very proud of that and then what did I do after that I was like I wonder what's going on in Diablo 3 these days and
1889221	1912410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1912390	1917077	I talked about it a little bit at length at the end of Bobby's show this week, so you can kind of go over there and check that out.
1917397	1923206	I'll just say in a nutshell, I think Digital Eclipse did the best job they could with the stuff they had.
1923626	1925930	And it's a worthy thing to check out, right?
1925990	1930616	Not only do you have a pretty great collection, and I understand Network has been having a lot of issues.
1930636	1933200	I saw a patch go out this week, but I'm just keeping it real.
1933180	1935543	I don't have an interest in playing this game online with strangers.
1935943	1937605	So I haven't touched the online features.
1937985	1945673	But I spent hours and hours on the original Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat 2 on the Super Nintendo.
1945693	1949457	And yes, I'm aware that Mortal Kombat Super Nintendo played a little differently.
1949477	1954983	But when that's the version you know, you know, it's kind of like, it's neat to kind of go back to that a little bit.
1955224	1956865	They do talk about that in the documentary.
1956885	1962511	They're very upfront in talking about that the Super Nintendo version was a little bit slower and sort of had the reputation for having the better graphics.
1962752	1963052	So it
1963032	1968539	It was interesting to see the things that they weren't afraid to talk about and be a little bit critical of.
1968579	1970761	The other one would be Mortal Kombat 4's reception.
1971242	1977469	It's pretty well acknowledged that Mortal Kombat 4 laid the groundwork for the Mortal Kombat games that came later.
1977990	1988903	I maybe wish the final video, instead of being half a recap video, I maybe wish the final video had gotten a little more into maybe talking to some of the modern Mortal Kombat team members.
1989263	1991706	I would have especially loved to see younger...
1991686	2011433	and I even mean like 20 and 30 year olds working on Mortal Kombat today and what they get from the old games I think would have been a really nice sort of footnote to the whole thing as opposed to like it's like a half recap video it was fine but I just felt like that little piece was missing because of course at the end it goes and then Mortal Kombat 4 was released and then
2011413	2012655	Then we have the Game Boy games.
2012675	2014457	Then we have Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance.
2014477	2015699	Then we have Mortal Kombat Annihilation.
2016080	2018002	It just kind of runs through the rest.
2018763	2019304	But I get it.
2019364	2021547	Those games are newer and they're not part of the collection.
2021627	2024231	So they just have a little plaque and that's it.
2025112	2030780	But I would have loved to see that come full circle about the real impact that that original trilogy had on the games.
2031141	2039072	It's also very interesting the way they very quickly acknowledge and move on from Tobias leaving Midway when he did.
2039793	2040694	Um...
2040674	2044939	So that was just kind of interesting to me as I was like, boy, they really quickly kind of mentioned that.
2044979	2051626	I understand it's not about what he did after that, but you sort of get it.
2051807	2060557	Like when you're watching it, you see a whole section on, they did Mortal Kombat, the live tour, they did Mortal Kombat action figures, they did Mortal Kombat, all this.
2060577	2063560	And you're kind of like, how much money...
2063540	2066385	Who was that making money for at the end of the day?
2066405	2068850	Was it the four folks that created the game?
2068870	2070132	The five that worked on the sequel?
2070192	2071935	The seven that worked on three?
2071955	2074099	How much money did Tobias ultimately make from that?
2074119	2077365	And a lot of that was Ed Boon and his ideas.
2077385	2081633	So I can see where at some point he probably got...
2081613	2095791	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2096513	2099658	There's a lot of infers.
2099678	2103144	I would love to see the unofficial Mortal Kombat legacy.
2104246	2111378	But again, Digital Eclipse has to keep it clean and has to keep everybody happy.
2111398	2115365	And I think they did the best job they possibly could with what they have access to.
2115385	2119191	Because, yeah, I did notice they have two mocap performers.
2119752	2122757	One of them, I think, still works for NetherRealm.
2122737	2151630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2151610	2176707	that uh Richard Divizno I think his name is I may be pronouncing that wrong he played Kano in the original I never realized he was the campy as fuck Quan Chi in the Sub-Zero mythologies and it's so funny to see that stuff now because you're like it's and I mean that in the best possible way I love camp so um seeing that now and the FMV from like Sub-Zero mythologies like it's
2176687	2204803	the game is rough but it is if you just view it as what it is which is high fucking camp of the CD-ROM era I'm talking SimCity with live action news sequences spliced in CD-ROM era if you look at Sub-Zero Mythologies as that it's actually neat and I never realized how much crossover but it was a little weird to me that he being such a big part of the motion cap family
2204902	2210392	Nowhere to be found other than acknowledgements and the videos that happen to have him in it.
2210412	2215661	I would have tried to get an interview with him, and I'm sure they did, to Digital Eclipse's credit.
2215681	2223615	So just a bummer that I'm sure other reasons that are more Netherrealm or really going back to Midway Williams control.
2224737	2225458	Yeah.
2225810	2228616	Also, DarkSakura, I never knew this.
2228636	2229999	Did you know this?
2230079	2234409	Steve Ritchie, he's all over this documentary because he's the voice in Mortal Kombat 2.
2234770	2235932	I never knew he was the voice.
2235952	2236594	Yes, that's right.
2236614	2238117	I never knew that.
2238137	2238638	I knew it.
2240002	2243267	He's done the voices when we were hanging out at a pinball party once.
2243447	2245731	Yeah, and is so iconic.
2246252	2249076	Mortal Kombat 2 had the best voiceovers of any Mortal Kombat game.
2249096	2251981	Mortal Kombat 1, I think they say that Ed Boon did the voices in that.
2252121	2254645	And I think Steve Ritchie did him in 3?
2254705	2255226	I'm not sure.
2255546	2258251	But 2, which is like the most iconic, he did the voices for that.
2258611	2260053	I never realized that.
2260074	2262938	As Sherlock points out, you'll hear it if you go...
2262918	2265643	I am the Black Knight from Black Knight 2000.
2266184	2270452	I mean, he was also, what's his face, the head in No Fear.
2271975	2276303	He did a lot of the voices in a lot of the tables, but yeah, he did a lot of voices for Midway.
2277008	2291142	You know who else is all over this documentary is they have a few podcast folks and, you know, folks that comment on pop, you know, video game culture just because, you know, they speak like what the community was at the time.
2291202	2295407	And, you know, oh, I saw this commercial on TV to try to, like, get that perspective sort of thing.
2295427	2299090	One of those commenters, Cliffy B. You remember him?
2299110	2301293	He was the guy that did Gears of War, right?
2301753	2303775	Now, all I'm going to say is.
2304548	2311158	You may remember, go back to the episode where the very first Karateka Gold Master Series came out.
2311178	2313302	I know Mortal Kombat isn't an official Gold Master Series.
2313322	2314263	Go back to the Karateka.
2314283	2319211	I said, Ed Boon is randomly interviewed here.
2320012	2325240	I bet they were getting recordings of him for a Mortal Kombat collection and asked him a few questions here.
2325845	2353658	so now we've got Cliffy B in this so I wonder I actually don't think it's Gears of War I wonder if a Jazz Jackrabbit collection is coming or specifically and I would love the shit out of this and if they're not doing it this is a reasonable one I would love to see them do an Apogee, early Apogee collection holy fuck Commander Keen, Jazz Jackrabbit, Jilla the Jungle a collection with that
2353638	2377317	I would love that and I think there's a lot of people that really missed that arrogance because they could even get into the fact that like BBSs were the reasons why those games were huge and I think there are so many people today that have no idea what the fuck a BBS even is like before the internet oh that'd be cool like if they had like a little like a BBS simulator like here's what it's like to be on a BBS they know what a BBL is okay
2379473	2385199	Okay, BravoCon is a different podcast, DarkSakura.
2385219	2386441	Okay.
2386461	2390665	But anyway, comments in chat.
2390765	2393448	Sycoon says, what the hell is CliffyB up to now anyway?
2393748	2394349	Good to see you, by the way.
2394870	2400556	I think he's more like an industry, like, not a commentator.
2400596	2404220	The people you bring in to, what's the word?
2404320	2404960	It's an easy word.
2405021	2407303	You bring them in to tell you what you're doing wrong.
2408330	2409932	Collaborator, not critic.
2410553	2410994	Oh my God.
2412676	2414199	Why can't I think consultant?
2414219	2415881	My God, why is that word escaping me?
2415941	2416482	Consultant.
2416502	2418785	I think he's a consultant in the industry now, pretty much.
2419406	2430422	So, but that's, so that's my little, and I don't know if anyone from Digital Eclipse actually listens to this show, but if that idea wasn't on your radar, God, I hope it is.
2430402	2436791	because that like an Apogee or even, you know, I think it might be asking a lot to get all of those games in one collection.
2436811	2443459	So even if it is just a Jazz Jackrabbit or something that like gets into the BBS era, how those things trade, I would eat that shit up.
2443660	2444421	I'd be so into that.
2444921	2446443	So anyway, but they do.
2446984	2447885	Digital's been doing great.
2447905	2451490	They've been doing great work with these collections and museums and stuff.
2451510	2456697	And I just I do hope they are financially motivated by the buyers to do more of it.
2456677	2482836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2483390	2484852	But here's the thing.
2484872	2487875	I never understood when we talked about reheating the nachos.
2487995	2492521	And I'm borrowing that from what everybody said about Mayhem, the Lady Gaga album.
2492541	2494083	Oh, she's reheating her nachos.
2494363	2498468	And I heard it again this week when the new Robin single came out, which is so fucking good, by the way.
2498488	2498989	Dopamine.
2499189	2501511	But it was like, oh, there goes Robin reheating her nachos.
2501552	2505556	And I'm like... Nachos are fucking good.
2505937	2507018	And like...
2507268	2523623	and DarkSakura.
2525611	2530665	All that to say, yes, Luminous Arise is just a different puzzle game.
2532430	2533694	I don't even want to say shoehorned.
2533714	2535118	I feel like that's a negative term.
2535138	2537986	But it's wrapped in the skin of Tetris Effect.
2538006	2541375	And some are going to say, oh, it's just reheating Tetris Effect's nachos.
2542030	2543533	Who fucking cares?
2543553	2545096	The game is incredible.
2545116	2546399	The heated nachos are still good.
2546419	2547181	That's right.
2547201	2549004	Nachos are fucking good.
2549165	2554676	If you say that term, I'm going to slap your hand if you touch my nachos before eating a Chili's.
2554736	2556039	I'm going to slap your damn hand.
2556379	2559145	You do not get to use that term as a negative.
2559125	2560909	It's fine.
2561270	2564257	So yeah, I'm loving Luminous Arise.
2564458	2566001	I think the music's pretty good.
2566042	2572998	The visuals are really, I mean, they're almost like I said about the demo review, they're almost a little distracting sometimes.
2573459	2574602	But I will say this.
2575308	2578951	They did a very good job on the accessibility of that sort.
2578971	2581574	There's a slider for the visual effects.
2581614	2584757	There's a slider for the random zoom ins and outs.
2584777	2585818	There's a slider for this.
2585838	2586778	There's a slider for that.
2587119	2597328	So like they made it very accessible where like if Luminous is going to give you, you know, like, ah, this is hard on my eyes or even, you know, I could possibly have a medical incident because of this game.
2597648	2599890	They gave you complete control over all that stuff.
2599910	2602873	And they built Bobby Blackwolf mode into it.
2602893	2603914	They said...
2603894	2620519	here's a control so that you don't lose the game when you get to the top or the pieces don't even fucking fall like they built really easy accessibility into it that the demo did not represent so I would say that those sorts of features were really well done so
2620499	2627168	Seegers in chat saying it does not rise to the levels of electronic symphony in terms of music quality, but it's still a really good game.
2627709	2629111	I love it for what it is.
2629131	2634978	I feel like the music thing is just always going to be a debate that really relies on personal tastes a lot.
2635639	2642068	And I think as long as the music is good, like again, going back to the Lady Gaga example,
2642048	2643110	Thank you!
2643150	2663905	Thank you!
2663885	2689673	there's a brand new mechanic it's similarly again it's the nachos from Tetris Effect so it's hitting the L2 to like freeze time for a little bit but this time in Luminous they call it a burst mechanic and it's really satisfying the way it kind of moves the other pieces around and then there's like a mode in the game where like you have these like this mode is giant pieces that you have to move around this mode is nothing but bursts they they did a lot of like
2690581	2694094	Little fun modes for the game to try to mix it up a little bit.
2694114	2698470	But at the end of the day, the game is strongest when you're just playing the game for what it's worth.
2699574	2701662	I was watching Bear Debonair play it last night.
2701782	2702565	Yeah, what'd you think?
2703507	2707833	It's a lot busier than what I would have wanted, but it looks pretty fun.
2707953	2713180	Yeah, but now that you know there's sliders where you can turn that busyness down, hopefully it makes it a little more appealing.
2713720	2714562	A little bit more, yeah.
2714622	2721591	I was a little bit worried about that after the demo, but then when I actually opened the game and I was like, oh shit, they got tons of sliders in this game for the different effects and stuff.
2721911	2723453	I was like, okay, they did that right.
2723513	2724094	So good for them.
2724154	2724875	Good for them.
2724895	2728239	So anyway, if you're a puzzle game fan, highly recommend Luminous Arise.
2728580	2732485	If you've never jumped into the series, I don't know if that demo is still available.
2732465	2753916	but um I I'm pretty sure there's a demo there's gotta be like an online version of that game at some point I I check it out to see if you're into it I I I love Luminous as a puzzle you know if if Mizuguchi created that game because he couldn't port Tetris the first time the way he wanted to I think if he created something to be up there on the level with Tetris I think he
2753896	2777878	I think he's done a damn good job I think it's it's hard to put anything on the same level as Tetris but he's he's up there he's in that conversation Luminous is absolutely one of the all-time puzzle great games and absolutely worth your time Meteos next please thank you because I fucking loved Meteos I want to see that game back I don't know how they'll do it when there isn't a but there's there is a touchscreen is there a touchscreen at the switch too no they got rid of that didn't they
2778095	2778820	I don't remember.
2779464	2780995	So I don't know how they do medias.
2781015	2784358	There was a version on Xbox 360 that used controller.
2786633	2788516	I think you would have to keyboard mouse it.
2788636	2789458	Maybe there's a way.
2789518	2792122	Okay, Seeger says it's still touchscreen.
2792623	2793504	So, okay, I didn't know.
2793805	2795988	Well, how many games actually use it?
2796008	2802358	So I would love to see a Meteos that's like keyboard mouse or touchscreen on Switch 2.
2802559	2804582	Or, you know, Switch 2 has that mouse thing.
2804963	2808168	I would love to see a Meteos game that uses the mouse.
2808188	2810211	That would make me very, very, very, very happy.
2810191	2823019	so anyway that's it I've gone on long enough but you know Luminous is is really one of the all-time great puzzle games so it's really good to see a new entry in it this week um yeah all right let's get into some news Loki what's going on in the news
2823539	2849428	Ubisoft stuff um so there was a little bit of panic because Ubisoft had delayed their upcoming um quarterly earnings report uh basically saying and they also halted their trading because of it um it says Ubisoft announced the postponement and release of their first half of fiscal year 2025-2026 um
2849408	2878977	Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares and its bonds and from the market opening of November 14th until the publication of its first half 2025-2026 results in the coming days Ubisoft will inform the market of the date at which trading can restart and they weren't really sure what the reason was for it people speculated a buyout or something like that but apparently it's just according to the CFO
2879260	2907985	Thank you for watching!
2908673	2933550	SSJ100 Matt with the perfect comment in our chat saying this could be a lot of nothing or a whole lot of something that covers the spectrum this might maybe possibly be something potentially that could be big or it might be little that's just corporate speak it might be big or it might be a nothing burger a big nothing burger
2935758	2939842	Obviously, when I first read this, I'm going to be honest.
2939862	2950153	My initial reaction was like, look, if Yves Guillemin's last day is also my last day, you're welcome, industry.
2950193	2950954	You're welcome.
2950974	2951975	Thank you, game industry.
2951995	2952996	Thank you, game industry.
2953116	2953536	Good night.
2954998	2956840	We have brought you the Half-Life 3.
2956860	2959823	We have gotten rid of the Yves Guillemin.
2959843	2960263	Thank us.
2962808	2992309	but I'm not getting my hopes up to that extent because part of me is kind of like are they going to also get acquired by one of those fucking companies that just comes in to just shit the bed with everything and lay people off and just like take a company yeah that's what I'm worried about at the end of the day is this is going to be one of those types of information I don't know I find myself playing fewer and fewer Ubisoft games I play one
2992593	2996058	I can't play any at the moment right now because it's been a long time.
2996078	3001907	I think the last Ubisoft game I played was maybe Trackmania?
3003009	3010059	I keep wanting to buy a Just Dance game so I have some exercise stuff and then I'm like, I don't know.
3011301	3016609	I mean, I won one, but I mean, I still play Avatar because...
3016808	3019491	Honestly, I think it's the best thing that they've put out.
3019992	3021994	And it has remained updated.
3022014	3024457	They've actually been taking good care of the player base.
3025238	3026339	So I've kept playing it.
3026839	3027861	Just buy a used copy.
3029082	3031625	Maybe I'll go look for an old Just Dance on Switch.
3031705	3032966	Because Switch 2 will play Switch 1 stuff.
3033307	3036030	So go find an old version and buy that.
3036050	3037191	Yeah, because they're not making any more money.
3037211	3046782	I mean, technically, if you want to think about it, they're not really making any money anyways when you buy it at retail because technically they've already been paid at that point.
3047875	3048817	I mean, I don't know.
3048837	3049157	Whatever.
3049278	3050961	It's such a small drop in the bucket.
3051021	3052023	I get it.
3052243	3058815	But I'm not buying their Assassin's Creed games because I just don't like it and everything else they're doing is just not good.
3058835	3060698	So, whatever.
3060779	3065968	Well, like I said, the only thing good that they've put out at all has been the Avatar game.
3066826	3070111	SSJ100 Matt says, or Rob, you can just dance.
3070131	3070733	Jazz hands.
3071133	3071534	You know what?
3071654	3072215	Actually, okay.
3072415	3073357	Funny you say that.
3073818	3074879	You ready for another tangent?
3075480	3082472	I fell down a rabbit hole on TikTok the other night and I got introduced to, I think it was called immersive workout videos.
3082452	3108561	I don't know if you've seen these but it like I swear to god it's somebody took the idea for WarioWare and turned it into a workout video and what I mean is like it'll come up and it'll say uh crank or something like that so you put your hand up in the air and you do this this this this this and then the the YouTube video switches to an oven going on and off or a dial going left and right as you do it and then it'll be like lift and like do lifts like this
3108541	3114131	And then the YouTube switches to you're lifting a very large thing up in the air like a pig up and down and up and down.
3114151	3115253	It's really funny.
3115273	3121264	And when I was watching this, I was like, this is what Nintendo should be doing for the next WarioWare game.
3121284	3122847	This immersive workout thing.
3123268	3125492	This is 100% with the next WarioWare game.
3125833	3126634	Can you...
3128133	3130937	I'm sorry, I'm dropping all the bombs on my way out.
3131738	3140549	I'm telling you, Nintendo, you are leaving money on the table if you do not merge the icon that is Wario and a fitness game.
3140950	3151403	Can you imagine how fucking funny Wario and pals would be in a gym type of setting with this whole immersive workout trend, like actually being in a WarioWare type of game?
3151824	3152925	It would be incredible.
3153243	3153984	That would do it.
3154505	3155867	I mean... I would love that.
3155887	3160355	It took gamifying workouts to get a lot of people up and working.
3161176	3162799	That's kind of what I'm doing now.
3163400	3169309	When you think about Pikmin and Pokemon and Ingress, that's kind of why I fell down that.
3169630	3173937	I don't talk about it every week during my gaming week, but believe I'm still playing the shit out of those games.
3173957	3176041	That's why I don't play a lot of the other stuff.
3176381	3177563	So...
3177543	3183947	That was kind of why I was going to see if you ever, you know, I had asked before if you ever wanted to go walking together because I want to try Pikmin out.
3183967	3184951	I just don't want to do it by myself.
3185031	3186557	Oh, yeah, let's go.
3186689	3187811	Next time before.
3187831	3190254	You know I'm slow as hell with my hobbit legs.
3190415	3194060	The only thing that fucking sucks is that now it gets dark so early.
3194080	3196003	So it's like, and I'm not walking in the morning.
3196484	3198707	So it's like so dark, right?
3198727	3202313	So it has to be like a weekend basically or, you know, a day off.
3202453	3207921	Well, I mean, you could also, Rob, you could also join my adult ballet class.
3209403	3211005	I don't think that's the right fit for me.
3212667	3213809	You get your hobby.
3213829	3215271	We need more guys in ballet.
3216893	3219357	Guys thinner than me and better in shape.
3219777	3224564	Rob, I do ballet and I am really not the ballet body.
3224904	3226326	It's all good.
3226807	3229070	I'll just get Loki to join me.
3229090	3229711	Loki, you'll do it, right?
3229871	3233716	I can just recognize not everything is for me and that's okay.
3233736	3235419	Immersive workouts, that's for me.
3237321	3239224	Anyway,
3239795	3256808	and DarkSakura.
3257125	3259669	So what did we get at the Sony State of Play?
3259930	3264337	We got a new trailer for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined that's going to come out on February 5th, 2026.
3264437	3269144	We got an update on In Kobini, One Store, Many Stories.
3269705	3273231	It is a 1990s Japanese convenience store simulation.
3273251	3274713	It's coming out April 2026.
3275835	3277217	Coffee Talk Tokyo.
3277237	3279161	That's that indie game, the Coffee Talk games.
3279181	3281424	They're making one that's Japan-centric.
3281444	3283167	That's going to come out on March 5th.
3283147	3286652	Broken Lore, Unfollow, and Broken Lore Ascend.
3286672	3288794	I must admit, I don't know much about these games.
3288814	3292880	They're horror games, but they definitely look scary.
3293180	3300550	And I liked that one of the themes was like, we're going to go to the top of the tower to do a social media video and something up there is going to try to kill us.
3300570	3303874	I got to look more into this series because I feel like I might be into these actually.
3303894	3305556	So what do you all chat?
3305576	3306878	Should I be playing Broken Lore?
3307439	3311584	Anyway, Broken Lore, Unfollow, and Broken Lore Ascend are coming next year.
3311834	3333640	Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly Remake Dynasty Warriors Origins DLC Grand Turismo 7 24-Hour Races
3333620	3338428	I don't know if that literally means you're going to be playing your PlayStation for 24 hours, but that could be very interesting.
3338909	3340892	I would assume you could save as it goes, but we'll see.
3341874	3342635	Motion Rec.
3342795	3347824	It's an indie game where you record your movements and then you play them back at different parts of the stage.
3348084	3349727	Interesting little kind of puzzling mechanic.
3350067	3351329	Spring 2026 for that.

3372159	3378847	DLC for What's Upon a Katamari, but it's music packs and Neo remixes, not stages.
3378887	3381130	All they've been doing is just music packs.
3381150	3381791	I don't know about that.
3382552	3386297	Pac-Man World 2 is getting Sonic the Hedgehog DLC.

3403118	3410067	Sonic Racing Crossworlds getting Sega DLC and SpongeBob SquarePants DLC.

3436793	3438256	There's a lot of games they announced.
3438296	3439960	I'm going to skip ahead a little bit here.

3443368	3445893	Big update on Marvel Fighting Souls.

3462838	3464961	New bosses, all that good stuff.
3465181	3470490	And Sony is bringing out a new monitor, but it's only going to be released in Japan.
3470510	3473955	It's a 27-inch monitor with a 1440p screen.
3474695	3481723	And lastly, the big, big, big announcement, a PlayStation 5 digital Japanese only edition.
3482303	3493315	So taking a page from Nintendo's playbook, releasing a console that is only available for Japan and is, you know, Japanese language restricted and all that good stuff.
3493816	3498441	$355 or 55,000 people from importing.
3498792	3499994	No, of course not.
3500014	3505104	But it's also – obviously this is a counterplay to the tariff situation.
3505484	3515603	I did talk about this on social media and somebody brought up it also could have to do with how the price of the yen is kind of doing overall and perhaps why Sony is making a strategy like this.
3516044	3521433	I find it very interesting that Nintendo and Sony are making similar moves to be quite honest.
3521694	3522876	So –
3522856	3524077	Interesting.
3524097	3528542	Mike Deft says the Witch game was made by Pocket Pair of PowWorld fame.
3529463	3530565	Huh, I didn't catch that.
3531145	3532727	Yay, the game looked good.
3532747	3538173	So, at least Metroidvania is something that's been copied a ton of times, so PowWorld can copy that, no problem.
3539835	3542558	Oh yeah, no one will sue them over that.
3542578	3542818	Yeah.
3543840	3545361	Alright, anyway, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3546643	3548745	Oh, just more shenanigans.
3549400	3554950	So, and in fact, this is kind of something that I think a lot of people have already seen coming.
3556032	3562785	But the Funko Pop company, you know, the one that gives us all those weird looking figures that some of us are actually oddly attracted to.
3563575	3570542	Has they revealed in their last quarterly earnings report that they're in trouble?
3570882	3571603	They in trouble, girl.
3573645	3576667	Really big concern for the next fiscal year.
3578509	3588479	Because their loans are coming due, they are well in the hole for $241 million.
3591021	3592182	And
3592870	3601079	As it stands right now, though, they did amend their credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase in July to waive some of the requirements to get time.
3603381	3616836	But they're not really going to be able to pay out everyone they owe by the end of the next 12 months unless they do some pretty big changes.
3618284	3626899	Their CEO, Josh Simon, basically said during their earnings call, I'm just going to read this verbatim.
3626919	3634953	I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce.
3635574	3641625	In the short term, I'm looking to maintain the moment that they previously discussed.
3642449	3648460	So a lot more, you know, corporate talk happening.
3648862	3677011	One of the things that sort of like is kind of funny to me, not necessarily funny, haha, is that he's saying that as far as the company have existing for the last 27 years, they want to leverage that legacy they have and the relationship with the community to increase this, quote, global world of entertainment, pop culture, fandom with the increasing global world.
3677251	3678092	So
3680688	3683311	They're saying, oh, we have opportunities.
3683411	3684212	We can do this.
3685433	3697847	And it's not necessarily more that it has to do with losing licenses or how oversaturated the markets become.
3697927	3702472	But this is also going back to the fucking tariffs.
3702492	3705075	A lot of toys are made overseas.
3706372	3717545	One thing that Funko has found some success in that, honestly enough, I'm kind of surprised they didn't do this a lot earlier is blind boxes.
3717965	3719407	The mystery boxes.
3719427	3721389	I mean, look at how the Labubus are doing.
3722650	3725574	There's a Labubu vending machine at the movie theater.
3725674	3728978	Those Popmarts are popping the fuck off.
3728998	3730079	I bought my first one, Rob.
3731320	3732902	That's a you problem.
3733405	3735668	No, it's not like a Lububu one.
3735869	3740396	It's one of the other PopMart ones, but it's the Disney ones, and I have a Daisy Duck.
3740416	3746865	Alan's not into Lububu specifically, but like a lot of those, like the other types of stuff they sell at PopMart and the blind boxes, he's into that stuff.
3746885	3748488	And I like the monsters.
3749089	3749710	I want one.
3750110	3750831	I only want one.
3752694	3755098	One day there will be a set where I go, I want that.
3755178	3756119	So we'll, you know.
3756139	3757441	Every time I see the Lububu things.
3757461	3758623	Yeah, I have the Demu Daisy.
3758643	3759885	That's the one Sia Tiberi.
3760372	3762395	It's just where the wild things are.
3762515	3763116	That's all I see.
3763136	3765600	They're making merch for where the wild things are.
3766502	3772110	I think the demus are cuter than the monsters.
3772131	3772611	But anyway.
3775035	3775696	But back to this.
3778140	3785832	We're either going to have a more tailored market, a lot more blind boxes, or more landfills.
3786954	3787054	Yeah.
3787034	3794284	Yeah, you know, I was giggling at SSJ100 Matt's comment in chat saying, I thought they were in trouble when they were burying Funkos in the desert like E.T.
3794665	3797229	And I was just thinking about like the parallels with Atari.
3797369	3803798	And when Atari and the game industry crashed in the 80s, it was like, you know, those things were everywhere.
3803918	3810448	The games, you know, and it's not a complete parallel because obviously there were like anybody could make an Atari game at that point.
3810548	3812811	And there's a lot of shovelware and stuff like that.
3812831	3814273	But I also feel like with
3814253	3838641	with Funko Pops they're not special anymore like it used to be like a niche thing you would find in like a corner of a hot topic but now it's like they're fucking everywhere and I feel like it's just not special like it was in the beginning I think it was their point is that they wanted it to hit everywhere I don't know if that was the best strategy I do yeah and see I I only I
3838975	3858520	and DarkSakura.
3858500	3887680	I have to do this funky but I can get it it's not a big deal if not I can put it somewhere else it's just a demonstration and the other thing too is that they really fucked up with losing the license for Dead by Daylight because I thought the Funko Pop ones would have been a lot cuter than the U2's although that has not stopped me from getting the Legion and the Meg and if they do a pig I'll get pig
3888993	3894109	and I have a Jeff the Shark I think I figured out how to do this
3894207	3895529	Hold on.
3895609	3907588	Again, for the live folks, for the folks on the podcast, you have to explain this a little bit, but we're seeing a large wall of Funko Pops pictured with a door with an ace flag hanging off of it.
3907608	3909471	But there's some very large Funko Pops here.
3910272	3914519	Yeah, I have like a Unicron and I have a Retsuko with the chainsaw.
3915120	3920468	And I have like just the ones that I get are like the ones I'm super interested in.
3921207	3942068	and yeah I have Unicron Spike and then those are like my Marvel ones up there and actually not all my Marvel ones but I have like my Hanukkah Donald Duck and you know just some different gaming ones and like I don't often want all the same ones all the time but uh
3942706	3951687	All right.
3953388	3981454	and I just give those away I actually have a bunch of the supernatural ones too that I am finding a new home for I only have a handful of the pop dolls I have a random Mass Effect or Overwatch one here and there and then I have some Drag Queen ones I have the Golden Girls and I have Drag Queen ones because the Golden Girls were the game specifically I have a Britney Spears and a Whitney Houston as well but I'm told my Trixie Mattel doll is apparently worth some money oh yeah yeah
3981856	3989285	Yeah, my supernatural ones, some of the ones I have are worth some money, like a couple of my Castiel's and my Crowley.
3992690	4002061	Okay, Ranma, I'll think of something, but they're kind of worth some money, question mark, in Tarabang.
4003503	4007408	But back to the thing, it's like...
4009160	4013810	The ones that... That's like the extent I go with mine.
4014210	4017978	However, I know people... You're familiar with Polyester, right?
4019221	4020463	Yeah, streamer on Twitch, right?
4020744	4023169	Yeah, Dead by Daylight, Fog Whisperer.
4023770	4030003	Whenever he's live, there are walls of illuminated cabinets of pop figures behind him.
4032312	4037501	I know people who are worse than that, or better, maybe?
4038984	4050405	But yeah, there's just so many collectors out there that would be really surprised by this, but the fact is that
4052123	4053485	They're getting ridiculous.
4054066	4059393	I was actually going to order one of the ones for the pig, the Saw ones.
4059413	4065641	And it's either Kramer, which is the normal one, or there's a special one in six is the pig mask.
4065661	4072070	And if you just go to directly buy the pig mask one, they're charging $70 for it or more.
4072891	4075915	And if you go just to get the John Kramer one, it's still almost $20.
4076175	4079920	So it's just...
4081385	4083227	It's ridiculous.
4083508	4093800	And then there's such a disparity because then you go into, say, GameStop or something, and they do the BOGOs for the pop figures, or they're marked down.
4094521	4095962	I find them at Ross all the time.
4097604	4100207	Oh, I wouldn't have thought to check there, but that makes a lot of sense.
4101008	4102891	That's also where I go to look for Transformers for Dan.
4104052	4104152	Okay.
4104588	4105754	All right.
4105774	4106558	Well, let's move on.
4106578	4108226	We still have some ground to cover.
4109071	4110397	And let's get to this, Loki.
4110417	4111543	I find this interesting.
4112570	4119602	Yeah, it's like, I don't even know if I was looking forward to a Fallout 4 10th Anniversary Edition.
4119943	4125693	Which is funny, because I think they just did a Fallout 4 Remaster not that long ago, or some sort of extra edition.
4126214	4133767	I think that just came out, because I remember going to play Fallout 4 again, but I was like, oh, this breaks all the modding stuff.
4133787	4135270	And so now they have...
4135250	4148685	yet another Fallout 4 version the Anniversary Edition and it came out and it's supposed to have fixed a few issues but in usual Bethesda fashion they fucked it all up because
4149965	4151127	It's what they do.
4152308	4154411	So apparently they had some issues.
4154551	4168529	Well, mainly I think the main reason, the whole point of them putting this out is so they can shove that fucking creation part into Fallout 4 so they can sell their own mods and DLC.
4169931	4170712	So that's in there.
4170752	4172735	But it's also breaking save games.
4172755	4176299	It's also asking you to install the extra DLC.
4176319	4176900	Okay.
4177353	4201335	while you already have the DLC installed is doing a lot of things they also complicated the whole launch of this by basically saying here's a chart here's a chart for all the game versions that you can buy and you know you need the chart so that you know what you're getting and that's annoying um
4202058	4205201	But at the very least, they're going to be patching it.
4205361	4212387	Unfortunately, the patches to fix a lot of these issues aren't going to be coming out between... Some of them aren't coming out until December.
4213108	4230023	But right now, they are hot-fixing the stability problems with Xbox One and PlayStation 4, fixing an issue causing creations that rely on DLC not to work, and fixing an issue causing DLCs to become uninstalled after updating the game on PlayStation.
4231133	4233476	and yeah, that sucks.
4233496	4235980	Why do you keep breaking things?
4236901	4247896	Maybe design a new engine or use a current engine that people have instead of shoehorting this thing that's been around for longer than 10 years.
4247916	4250440	A lot longer than 10 years with this horse stuff.
4251922	4253904	Yeah, not a great look on this one.
4253965	4256047	It just makes it seem kind of rushed, right?
4258010	4259352	Yeah, I mean...
4260412	4260873	I don't know.
4261253	4262795	Is it really needed?
4262815	4270225	Like, I mean, if it's just putting the creation stuff in there and doing some hotfixes, like, just patch the game if you want to do hotfixes.
4270245	4273449	But really, all they're trying to do is make some extra money.
4273469	4279417	Because, you may remember, Bethesda is owned by Microsoft, and Microsoft need be profitable.
4279437	4280539	Because, you know, 30%.
4281580	4284384	Gotta shove that 30% into Fallout 4.
4285185	4286967	Gotta make them monies.
4286987	4287448	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
4288964	4291770	All right.
4292231	4293033	Let's move on.
4293173	4295778	I forgot that's because Bethesda is part of Microsoft now.
4295819	4298765	So that's all part of that fuckery too, right?
4298805	4300328	So good lord.
4300448	4300729	All right.
4301350	4304577	Also in the realm of questionable decisions.
4304557	4309041	Let's talk a little bit about what's going on with Black Ops 7.
4310042	4314966	You know, because this is the game that they upped the price of Game Pass because they wanted to put this game on Game Pass.
4314986	4316968	And now, guess what folks are noticing?
4317569	4318970	AI-generated art.
4319070	4330881	Now, while nothing is confirmed, it is, of course, getting called out on social media, as these things tend to do, that, hey, look, here's this photo where this cartoon character has six fingers.
4330901	4332522	And the eyes don't look quite right.
4332502	4338329	They also look like all of the Studio Ghibli stuff.
4338349	4341813	You know how they have the AI-generated art stuff.
4342194	4348881	It's so weird though because it's Call of Duty Black Ops 7 and it's like some anime-styled knights.
4349682	4353647	What does that have to do with anything that's going on in Black Ops?
4353767	4357632	It has literally nothing that has to do with Black Ops whatsoever.
4357712	4359394	It just looks like cheap, generic stuff.
4359654	4360315	And
4360936	4384733	I don't think they denied that it was happening.
4384713	4389628	to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players.
4389648	4393179	Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.
4393520	4396630	That is a long way of saying, you got me.
4397926	4399868	They got us, Cal.
4399888	4412622	Yeah, well, there's a difference between using tools like, say, for example, like AI tools that cut the spaces, the blank dead air spaces on a podcast or something like that to edit down the podcast.
4412642	4413263	It's a tool.
4413603	4422714	But if you're using this tool to do all of your work for you and you're just like, well, my job is to go, yeah, that looks good enough and then send it on its way.
4422794	4425857	Like, I'm sorry, that doesn't really...
4425837	4432388	it's clear when the art style there is no cohesive art style
4432621	4437387	AI should be a tool to help folks in creating art.
4437848	4439690	AI should not be a replacement for art.
4440070	4445197	And it's very obvious here that the art assets are being replaced with AI-generated stuff.
4445217	4445477	Anyway.
4446599	4448741	By the way, it's not just EA.
4448801	4450604	Surprise, surprise.
4450624	4455289	Anno 117 Pax Romana is a game that Ubisoft's been pushing.
4455329	4457132	I mean, do I need to read the rest of the story?
4457152	4458113	You all know where this is going.
4458453	4459415	You all know where this is going.
4460256	4462138	You already know.
4462557	4488193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4489675	4490216	Well, why?
4490276	4492779	You're so proud of the work that you put out.
4492799	4495702	Are you saying it's cheap shit and you shouldn't be using AI?
4496003	4498125	I thought you were so proud of the AI that you're using.
4498185	4507777	Well, they put a banner on the store that they're using AI and this image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process.
4508297	4509919	The final image is attached here.
4511221	4513283	That's fucking bullshit.
4513303	4514024	I'm sorry.
4515206	4518990	It's just Ubisoft doesn't give us a lot of reasons to believe them, so why should we?
4521097	4521499	Sorry.
4521941	4522342	And you should.
4522704	4523487	No one should believe them.
4525034	4525496	Moving on.
4525576	4526038	DarkSakura.
4527826	4529031	Okay, so...
4530445	4537257	There is an anime coming out for Death Stranding Isolations is what it's called.
4537277	4541704	That's a working title so far and it will stream on Disney Plus in 2027.
4542205	4551441	Yeah, that's very early announcement for that, but it's basically just
4552687	4556671	People on Adventures in the World of Death Stranding, as far as I can tell.
4556691	4558072	It is produced by Kojima.
4558393	4561556	Director is Sano Takayuki.
4563518	4567882	Character design by Ilya Kuvshinov.
4567902	4571566	And it's being produced by E&H Productions.
4572066	4574969	So it's set in North America.
4575590	4579774	And it's basically people just dealing with their isolation.
4580969	4582231	Well, yeah.
4582251	4585596	Too bad I'm not going to see it because it's Disney Plus and I fucking cancelled that service.
4585916	4587058	Hey, you know what else is coming out?
4587879	4590763	Or at least according to Bob Iger, what he wants to do with Disney?
4591224	4594749	You know how all these companies are ripping off all this stuff with AI?
4595470	4597573	He's like, fuck that shit.
4597593	4599315	Why are we making money off of that?
4599415	4608408	So he wants to incorporate that shit with your own IP and so you can generate your own cartoons and shit using Disney IP on their platform.
4608508	4609710	Fuck that shit.
4610028	4617275	If they wouldn't run that risk with their intellectual material, then sure, I guess.
4617796	4619377	What a horrible decision.
4619978	4621820	So how long until the Mickey Mouse porn?
4622240	4625023	How long until the Mickey Mouse porn that's AI generated?
4625423	4628527	Because I'm sure you all are saying, well, there's plenty of that on the internet, Rob.
4628827	4634953	How often until I can generate it and share it so easily on Disney Plus?
4634973	4635794	It's just silly.
4637295	4637976	Anyway.
4639593	4640774	Moving on.
4641956	4643477	Loki, I think you got our next story.
4644538	4644959	All right.
4645820	4648463	Well, Red Dead Redemption is back again.
4649764	4652767	Now they're going to be doing some updates to the game.
4653768	4656912	They're bringing it out on a few different platforms as well.
4656932	4664260	I think it's now coming to the more modern platforms, Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5.
4664280	4667203	They're getting a 60 FPS update.
4667183	4674532	which is good because the game only ran at 30, enhanced image quality, HDR, and resolutions up to 4K.
4674552	4684985	The Switch 2 version, not going to feature all of the 4K nonsense, but it says DLSS HDR mouse controls, also 60 FPS, okay?
4685005	4686908	That's a high resolution, not 4K.
4688229	4693596	And yeah, and so that's going to be coming out also on Netflix.
4693576	4696302	Netflix on iOS and Android.
4696362	4698847	I guess it's mobile too, so you can play it through Netflix.
4701172	4701412	Wow.
4702054	4702735	It's everywhere.
4702875	4706583	Netflix has been pushing the game thing lately.
4706603	4708187	I've seen a lot more ads for it.
4708307	4709830	They're really trying to
4709995	4731362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4731342	4744761	some of the 60, they really could use some more games with 60 FPS updates and stuff, like I could think like I would love a remaster of Grand Theft Auto 4 please, can I get that please like that would be amazing
4746513	4754789	Alright, well, before we get to the classic game of the week, it's interesting how fast this particular game is becoming a classic games of sorts.
4755190	4756312	Conquered, you remember that?
4756473	4762184	I wouldn't blame you if you didn't because it was out for a week and then they pulled it and ended up refunding everybody.
4762204	4763627	The game bombed that hard.
4763607	4770756	and, uh, you know, it did lead to discussion among people about, you know, well, why the fuck do we buy these games and then companies can just pull them?
4770776	4771557	You know what?
4771577	4772918	We're going to keep this game alive.
4773019	4774460	And this is, this is wild.
4774921	4784012	The internet, the modding community added again, the modding community rebuilt Concord's backend, created new servers, uh,
4783992	4784393	Hmm.
4785134	4798761	Hmm.
4799382	4815670	So I don't think Sony is really happy about this particular thing, but this is just leading to that kind of climax here of the players battling back against these game companies who pull the plug on things that fans are trying to support.
4815650	4818875	and saying, you know what, that thing you spent your money on, never mind.
4819076	4822221	At least Sony refunded players in this circumstance.
4822241	4825406	It's not like the crew sort of circumstance where it was up for a year and then it was pulled.
4825747	4831336	But I'm not surprised and nobody should be that this kind of happened.
4831356	4838147	And it just also lends itself to that whole, the servers are hard to keep up and expensive and da-da-da-da.
4838988	4841573	The modders just showed you a way to do it.
4841633	4853535	And I don't know if they have a server or if they did a player-to-player thing or what they did, but however they did it, they got them running without Sony's involvement, which is a huge sort of kick in the butt in a way.
4854898	4856681	More effort than should have been put into that game.
4856701	4857843	They did it better than us.
4857883	4858384	We're mad.
4859286	4860388	And kind of.
4860773	4866329	Now, QuestBuster does say, Sony DMCA'd the gameplay videos on YouTube, but not the project.
4866910	4868294	At least not yet.
4868314	4870861	Well, that's because that's going to be the lawsuit, QuestBuster.
4870941	4871363	Just wait.
4871543	4872887	Wait till Monday.
4872907	4873709	We'll see what happens.
4874311	4875795	But I...
4875775	4878658	I kind of want to see something like this go to court.
4878678	4879939	It never will.
4879959	4883403	Even if a lawsuit is filed, these things never go to court.
4883483	4892172	And that's why we are always in this problem because they are always settled before a judge or at some point the Supreme Court makes a determination.
4892592	4895715	It's always settled.
4896296	4896736	Anyway.
4896757	4899940	And you know the reason why a lot of companies insist on settling, right?
4900080	4900180	Yeah.
4900885	4905852	It's just to make it avoid setting any sort of precedence by going that far.
4906293	4906874	Right.
4906894	4908256	Yeah, that's true.
4908276	4912101	Oops, sorry for the noise sneaking in there.
4912121	4912802	I'm setting up something else.
4914445	4922416	You know, what if it were to be that the precedent is set that no, gamers have the right to do this?
4923698	4928665	I mean, I think it's a huge win for a lot of people, but I think the gaming industry might see that as a bit of a loss.
4929640	4937980	so anyway alright let's take a trip down memory lane with our next segment
4948338	4956187	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4956207	4959952	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4959972	4971105	And something I think that folks need to keep in mind with this is that you've only got two of these picks left, so you got to make them count, right?
4971608	4972369	Yeah.
4972389	4975252	So I think that's kind of where we're going tonight.
4975412	4977234	Blame Rob for this one, though.
4977254	4979437	In a way, you got to sign off on it.
4979477	4981179	What is the classic?
4981199	4983301	I wouldn't have even had it on my radar.
4983321	4984683	All right.
4984743	4986885	I was going to do Legendary Wings, okay?
4987746	4990630	Well, I think this one's a long time coming.
4990650	4991871	What is the classic game of the week?
4992672	4994494	It's in the groove.
4994913	5001103	It is a rhythm game developed and published by Rocksaur Games.
5001123	5009476	It was first shown in a beta test preview on July 9th, 2024 and officially released August 30th, 2024 in arcades.
5010197	5020313	There has been some ports and sequels and stuff, but basically it...
5020698	5022080	And everyone thought this too.
5022100	5025024	It was completely biting off of DDR.
5026126	5034719	You know, with your scrolling arrows and you hit the arrows on the top and you have holds and all this stuff and like things that have come out.
5034879	5036521	Basically all stuff that came out from DDR.
5037022	5043552	I mean, the games are, the game, it is a ripoff.
5043732	5044593	I'm just going to say it right now.
5044693	5045254	It's a ripoff.
5046533	5049156	But, you know, you've got your life bar and everything.
5049216	5052140	If you play DDR, you've played this.
5052160	5058648	So, you also, you know, you have different modifiers for speed and all of that.
5058688	5060991	And, yeah, I agree with Rinmari.
5061792	5064495	It's a really good ripoff.
5064836	5073406	And, of course, Seer in chat, formerly a Konami employee, saying that being in office when the PS2 release came out was wild.
5074888	5074988	Yeah.
5075812	5101397	but yeah there's like the different game modes you have like your normal dance mode you have a marathon mode where you have extended play battle mode is your versus play and when this first came out there were 76 songs that were available some were exclusive for PC and Mac and
5102255	5104238	A name we all know quite well.
5104318	5112309	Kyle Ward was their in-house musician and composed many of the songs.
5112329	5116996	So moving a little bit on.
5117036	5119059	Yes, there were home versions.
5119099	5125268	We had a PS2 release on June 17th, 2025, published by Red Octane.
5126149	5130355	And it had a novice mode that went into In The Groove 2.
5130335	5135400	Liquid Moon was a playable track and four songs that were going to show up in the sequel.
5135740	5150373	There was a PC version that had three songs from the cancelled In The Groove 3, widescreen aspect and edit mode, a patch called Song Pack A that released the additional songs and themes from In The Groove 2.
5151614	5159481	And you can progress through the game by clearing certain songs and modifiers and courses and different things to make it through the game.
5159461	5181891	um yeah and Rinmari points out Stepmania X is uh basically in the group three um so here was and this is where I said it's a rip-off Konami basically filed a lawsuit against Rockstar Games on infringement um this was on May 9th 2025 in Texas um
5183272	5191082	and they amended their complaint on July 1st, 2025 to include MC Groove's dance craze by Mad Catz.
5192384	5195248	And they basically were, huh?
5195608	5197711	I was just, oh God, I barely remember that.
5197731	5198252	But yeah, yeah, yeah.
5198372	5198893	Yeah, yeah.
5199714	5210148	But basically saying that Roxor infringed on their patent rights and that they were retrofitting arcade cabinets in an infringing and unfair way.
5210188	5211169	That's the quote.
5211149	5218944	And then they amended their complaint to include the In The Groove PS2 game and Red Octane.
5219665	5234052	So on July 25th, Roxor, that's in 2025, filed a counterclaim against Konami where they denied the claims of the complaint, saying that In The Groove does not violate patent law and claiming that Konami had engaged in unfair competition.
5234032	5235974	They eventually settled.
5235994	5245226	On October 18th, Rockstar announced that Konami had acquired the intellectual property rights to In the Groove series as part of the settlement up to litigation.
5245246	5255039	And they would later go on to create Pump It Up Pro, which is a spinoff of Pump It Up that features music and some of the features of In the Groove.
5256821	5260866	Of course, we also know Pump It Up is the five-button arrow smasher.
5262348	5267920	So it was built in a PC system called Boxor.
5268642	5273267	that ran a heavily modified version of DB and Linux.
5273768	5278713	It has a standard IDE hard disk, single core 32-bit processor.
5280054	5286681	They favored the AMD Athlon or the Intel Celeron, 128-megabyte NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 graphics card.
5286701	5288624	I mean, now thinking of that.
5288744	5289605	Cutting edge.
5290185	5290506	Right.
5291226	5295771	And 512 megabytes of DDR RAM.
5296392	5296472	Wow.
5296452	5299936	They're so ripping off DDR that it's DDR RAM.
5302098	5312090	So anyway, the upgrade kits were for Dance Dance Revolution machines and they had a special IO board called ItGeo that made a JAMA connection to the machine.
5314012	5321160	And they were using a proprietary fork of Stepmania to run the game.
5321140	5325947	They did install their own anti-piracy measures, which I also think is hilarious.
5327369	5332816	They used a serial dongle that prevented the execution of software on an unlicensed computer.
5333737	5341027	And for In The Groove 2, the ones that were manufactured by Andomero, they have BIOS passwords.
5341989	5348217	So going from this, this is the... I mean, that's really how it went.
5348778	5349679	And In The Groove...
5350790	5356838	It is... At Ranma, I did say that their system was called Boxor.
5358821	5365671	So, um... It's, um... It's complicated.
5365691	5369356	I, to this day, have not played an In the Groove.
5371439	5374583	To this day.
5374603	5376746	I have not played on a Stepmania.
5377607	5378248	To this day.
5380186	5389676	because, honestly, I did see this as a big stupid ripoff and I was very much supporting Konami.
5389877	5404773	I wanted to, you know, and I think I was a little bit more naive then when I was like, well, supporting the company that makes the games that I love might encourage them that, yeah, there is still a market for it.
5405654	5405974	And
5406578	5418556	I like to think that maybe it was this whole thing that spawned new continuations and expansions upon DDR to where, honestly, it's the survivor today.
5419798	5420519	It's still going.
5420640	5422082	There's new versions going on.
5422182	5424165	I actually really like the dance stage.
5424584	5439722	Just real quick, I just want to emphasize something you're saying there, Jamie, because I feel like, you know, in the past, when you look at this show, we all were pretty hard on this game when it came out, because I think we were, you know, hoping that, I don't know if it was that like Konami would, you know, see the light or whatever and so forth.
5439762	5447571	But I really feel like the interview that we did with Kyle Ward, and I don't remember what episode number it was, but it's back in one of the most insightful episodes we've ever done.
5447551	5459334	I really think for me, it made it very clear that you kind of started to say that there is that this was sort of one way of showing that Konami's products, they wanted more.
5459354	5461098	It's really like the dance game scene.
5461118	5461959	They want more of that.
5462380	5464885	And Konami wasn't giving it to us.
5464865	5485185	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5485165	5499563	but yeah it's interesting and kind of just quickly as you say there at the end I think without this maybe Konami doesn't see where we want more of this in the US so it's interesting to have that sort of like
5501129	5503815	How it all ended up playing out in the end.
5503835	5505078	It's just interesting.
5505238	5506521	As John Hunter-Matt says, episode 596.
5507143	5507443	Thank you.
5507524	5510791	And that's in the OL archive that Dark Tetsuya has.
5510851	5514660	Actually, everything 500 on is still on the server.
5515141	5519271	So you could find 596 still on the server at least for another month or two.
5519471	5520353	So anyway.
5520333	5523377	Sorry, DarkSakura, but I just wanted to underline what you said there because I think it's important.
5523397	5531506	And it's also important to say, I think, that our thoughts behind it have changed a lot from where they were a thousand episodes ago.
5532247	5533449	I still don't think I'm going to play it.
5533909	5535311	I've made it this long, now it's bite.
5535331	5537393	Well, I don't think you can at this point.
5537413	5539035	It'd be very difficult.
5539256	5540617	I've seen machines here and there.
5541979	5546664	But I mean, I also, it's just like, what's the point?
5548507	5548787	Yeah.
5549510	5550051	I've played it.
5550211	5551453	It's fine.
5551713	5554477	It's DDR, but theftier.
5554738	5559164	Again, I think the Rob in 2025 views that game through a different lens than the Rob of 2005.
5559685	5565674	So, you know, it's one of those things where I go, it is what it is and I understand how we got here.
5565934	5569459	I too am frustrated that Konami was not putting out
5569439	5571162	A lot of dance games at the time.
5571462	5574728	But it was that home version was their biggest mistake.
5574788	5575750	They never should have done that.
5575770	5578555	Because that's the one part where Konami was leaning into.
5578855	5581540	They were still making Xbox versions and PS2 versions.
5581660	5583984	That's where they made their mistake.
5584004	5584765	But they know that now.
5585487	5589133	We heard about the patents of the arrows and the way that works and stuff.
5589153	5592038	And that not everything is...
5592018	5620455	Don't forget your past.
5620570	5634006	Hey, everyone, did you know that OLR was born on a train?
5634897	5636219	Yeah, on the BART.
5636239	5636780	BART!
5636800	5638723	Yep, on the BART.
5638743	5642990	With my ex, where I have no idea where he is, by the way.
5643010	5646135	If he's still out there, so if he came around, like, you can say hi.
5646335	5648940	Like, I'm like, is he alive?
5649140	5654328	I honestly don't know, which is a weird thing to think, but I've tried looking Facebook and all that stuff.
5654809	5655310	Orange, right?
5655490	5659116	Also, the Parapar craze has basically died.
5659501	5679670	there hasn't been a Parapara club to my knowledge like I think Velfar closed in about seven years ago or more maybe closed a long time ago yeah yeah um but but I mean Eurobeat's still going but the Parapara craze is is gone all right they got therapy it's no longer a craze
5679700	5697777	DarkSakura.com
5697757	5698878	Oh, you know what it is.
5699038	5699479	I do.
5699639	5700019	I do.
5700460	5701781	I think y'all will be pleased.
5701801	5703342	You do.
5703703	5704463	All right.
5705144	5709008	But again, it's one of those games where I'm like, we didn't already talk.
5709588	5709908	Oh, okay.
5710809	5711110	All right.
5712030	5713752	Until then, let the theory begin.
5713772	5715033	I think maybe I was saving it.
5715634	5716575	Yeah, maybe.
5716595	5716835	All right.
5716855	5719377	Anyway, let's do some rapid fire news.
5719417	5720739	Hit some other headlines real quick here.
5720759	5721980	We still have a lot of news to get into.
5722120	5722400	Loki.
5725183	5726464	Loki is muted.
5726782	5727363	Yes, we do.
5727503	5729425	We are muted.
5730185	5733809	We have some more LEGO stuff coming, and I'm excited about it.
5733949	5737312	So we've already gotten one set in the Legend of Zelda series.
5737372	5749104	They had the whole Dooku tree, and now we're going to be getting more as a tease that was put out by Nintendo of America announcing that Build the Legend coming in 2026.
5749384	5753548	So it looks like we're getting another Link version
5753528	5757376	and Zelda minifigs as well as a Ganon build.
5758538	5759540	So that looks pretty cool.
5761624	5763107	No word on what those sets are going to be.
5763367	5766313	I'm sure that we'll find out as we get closer to that time.
5768177	5768538	All right.
5769820	5770762	Yay, Legos.
5770902	5771844	More toys for adults.
5772565	5772886	All right.
5773908	5774389	DarkSakura.
5776259	5782549	And this is actually a game I was considering playing for one of my retro games.
5782569	5784191	It was Doshin the Giant.
5784912	5789399	It came out for 64DD and GameCube.
5789960	5793846	And now it's going to be heading for the...
5793826	5798252	Wait, this isn't the one that's heading toward the sish.
5798272	5800054	It's just games from the creator.
5800074	5801856	Well, that sucks.
5801936	5806863	Tale of the Sun and Aquanauts Holiday both came out on PS1.
5807523	5812029	And these are reviewing the titles for a preservation project.
5813090	5817696	And these are, looks like they're going to be coming out.
5819399	5820260	Hold on.
5820340	5822162	I think I misread this.
5824842	5853398	they're reviving them for this preservation project I saw Doshin the Giant and that's all I was focusing on I love Doshin the Giant but it's other misleading article is misleading same brain though but anyway there's no release confirmed for western audiences but it could happen alright and no Brad it's not Naughty Bear
5854323	5859690	Don't tell them all the no's or they'll figure out the yes I think I've already done Naughty Bear, haven't I?
5860413	5861177	I don't think you have
5861900	5862361	Oh, Lord.
5862561	5862961	Maybe.
5863081	5863342	Maybe.
5863382	5863722	I don't know.
5863742	5864163	Check the Wii.
5864183	5864763	Someone check the Wii.
5865044	5865644	All right.
5866145	5875856	Anyway, this is a real small thing, but if you care, Nintendo launched a new website so you can see what Switch games are working without issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.
5876957	5883245	But some games like Nier Automata, the end of Yora Edition, don't quite function properly on Switch 2.
5883285	5886068	So there are some games, if you want to check that out,
5886048	5888291	I can't believe the name of this website.
5888311	5889092	You ready?
5889112	5903213	switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com I think Nintendo needs one of those URL shortener sites, but switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com
5903193	5905618	And if you want the English version, slash en-us.
5906520	5907822	Why don't I put that link in chat?
5908604	5912031	And if you're on the podcast, you're just going to have to rewind and write that down.
5912051	5913975	But no, you can also probably just Google it.
5914355	5922231	It's the Switch software website, which I'm curious, do the Just Dance games work pretty well?
5922211	5923253	I guess, let's see.
5923633	5924514	Just Dance 2019.
5925256	5925856	Supported.
5926377	5928160	Just Dance free experience.
5928180	5931024	Supported and game behavior is consistent with Nintendo Switch.
5931365	5933207	And then what about Baila Latino?
5933267	5934750	I didn't even know they did a spinoff game.
5934770	5935851	That's kind of cute.
5936973	5937434	Support.
5937614	5939056	Oh, it's a different company.
5939076	5940017	It's not Ubisoft.
5940037	5944824	Ooh, someone like ripped off Just Dance to make a Latin American version of that.
5944905	5947148	Actually, that's kind of, that's actually kind of smart.
5947789	5948590	So, all right.
5950055	5951117	Yeah, I'm with Deft.
5951137	5956006	It would be neat if the site would say if the game has any sort of upgrade and not just compatibility.
5956026	5960675	There is a little more they could do with that database info, but it is what it is for now.
5961056	5961837	And it's official.
5962098	5963961	So there is that.
5963981	5964823	All right.
5965158	5965900	One more time.
5966020	5968567	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

6138911	6139652	Watch your wallet.

6155058	6159431	Ooh, I may have to say DarkSakura should get that because R-Type's a pretty great series.

6161116	6161737	I have the original.

6361518	6362159	I didn't know that.
6362339	6363440	Yeah, it's a beat-em-up.
6363580	6367624	Like, you know how they were doing, like, those, like, 8-bit beat-em-ups?
6367644	6369626	Well, this is more like a 16-bit beat-em-up.
6369646	6370247	Oh, you know what?
6370267	6371669	I think I did see something for that.
6372169	6372489	Okay.
6372509	6373010	Yeah, they're doing that.
6373030	6373751	It makes a lot more sense now.
6373771	6374892	It looks like Splatterhouse.
6374912	6375192	Okay.
6375993	6376273	Of course.
6376293	6380117	It reminds me a little bit more of a gory version of the Scott Pilgrim game.
6380553	6382075	Okay.
6382095	6382795	Gotcha, 5th Dream.
6383556	6383897	Alright.
6385058	6394568	Well, we have one more story, and it's a follow-up, and this is one of those things where I'll be very curious to see how this plays out, but I think we knew this was coming.
6394848	6396190	Loki, tell us the punchline.
6397031	6407782	So apparently, after the 31 developers were fired from Rockstar Games, a union representing the former employees has decided to file a lawsuit.
6408763	6409564	So
6409544	6418177	Now they are moving forward with legal claims against the company asserting that the firings constitute trade union victimization and blacklisting.
6419619	6431497	Despite our representation and attempts to meet with Rockstar to resolve the matter through negotiation, Rockstar have declined and persisted to terminate members of the union in a matter that is unacceptable and unlawful.
6432038	6438387	Accordingly, we have now issued formal legal claims against Rockstar on behalf of the claimants.
6439193	6441139	So we'll see how this all pans out.
6441660	6447718	Of course, Rockstar is confident that they're in the right, but of course they're always going to assert that.
6448289	6448910	Yeah, we'll see.
6449311	6453257	I mean, I think it's a bold claim to say that they were leaking information.
6453277	6455361	They would have to have evidence of that, I would imagine.
6455441	6463054	So, like, nor to say that the firings based off gross negligence are accurate.
6463474	6467922	Also because we haven't really even seen any of these recent leaks or whatever.
6468483	6468783	I don't know.
6468803	6470466	I'd be curious to see what's going on with that.
6471239	6477728	Well, you say lawsuit and I hear, that's what you get when you let your heart... Forget it.
6477809	6478089	All right.
6481073	6482255	I mean, we knew it was coming.
6482295	6483056	We knew it was coming.
6483877	6486020	But it'll be interesting to see how that all plays out.
6486040	6490146	It'll get settled, of course, because again, nothing ever actually ends up in a court.
6490227	6492069	So we'll see what happens with that.
6493932	6495514	We're going to get to the listener roundtable.
6495574	6498158	DarkSakura, though, I think you told me you had something you want to bring up.
6498847	6499649	I do, actually.
6499769	6503075	It's a, I guess a little last minute thing.
6503837	6503997	Sure.
6504478	6508807	But, wait, what?
6509388	6510671	Is the date on this wrong?
6511873	6512013	Uh-oh.
6513476	6519488	Well, no, the date that they put on it is a future date, but they don't say the year?
6520328	6534408	I hate when they do stuff like that and get their dates wrong.
6534749	6540497	There's a Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Festival Ultimate Appreciation Festival.
6540781	6547190	They are doing a... at the Belsal Tokyo Nihonbashi.
6548212	6553399	This is happening November 29th from 10 to 6.45 Japan time.
6553980	6556303	And they will be streaming the events on YouTube.
6556784	6563293	It will have a Danganronpa 2x2 playable demo, an exhibition era.
6563994	6566297	And Seager better go to this and take me lots of pictures.
6566397	6568160	I was going to say, is Seager still going to be in Japan?
6568200	6569201	Because it's right up his alley.
6570283	6570383	Yeah.
6570363	6592354	there's an exhibition era oh no oh he says I'm so salty I forgot to apply for a ticket merchandise corner stage events um I want to go so I guess I'll be watching YouTube yeah yeah no the two by two demo is definitely new so this is this is a new yeah so that's cool yeah all right
6592975	6594277	Listener Roundtable.
6594377	6596179	I don't know if we got emails this week.
6596199	6596880	I don't know if I saw any.
6596900	6597121	We did.
6597241	6597601	Oh, we did.
6597641	6598202	Good, good, good.
6598222	6598803	Let's get to them.
6599844	6602388	I guess I'll say the email one more time.
6602408	6603810	One more time for next week.
6603830	6607575	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.
6607975	6610499	I know of one we're getting next week, by the way.
6610659	6612261	Okay, but I just want to be very clear.
6612582	6615085	After next week's show is done.
6615065	6641241	Basically the important mailbox is the one I need an archive of.
6641407	6643580	Yeah, so that's... Yeah, we'll figure that out.
6643641	6646036	Anyway, but let's get to the email tonight.
6647384	6648531	Alright, so...
6649760	6650882	Hello, OLR crew.
6650942	6654828	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Mike Deft.
6654848	6663042	I could talk about so many things right now, but I want to write and thank you all for the years of being every Sunday and sharing your time with us each week.
6663062	6668431	I just want to talk about something that Rob was talking about in the previous episode about it being hard to give up on something or let go.
6668491	6672578	He probably already knows that, and he's also not alone in that aspect.
6672558	6677166	I personally had my own struggles and I do with my own projects like my podcast GFM Cast.
6677186	6685560	It started in 2016 and ended quite abruptly in 2023, but it ended more because of real life situations at that time that affected all the hosts.
6685580	6692372	But in the end, it was my decision to end it despite my host kind of wanting to continue with it, but they still agreed with GFM Cast ending.
6692352	6700364	We could probably turn to record the podcast again, but also not getting views or new listeners each week is something that unmotivated me personally.
6700384	6704790	That being said, I don't regret making GFMcast and I don't regret my decision to end it.
6705151	6706373	Every single episode was great.
6706393	6710078	I enjoyed the time with my friends and chatting about whatever we had in mind that week.
6710098	6713804	But I'm also glad I finally have a full weekend to do whatever I want.
6713904	6717169	I don't miss any Pokemon Go events or having to cancel an episode because of it.
6717650	6720013	I had some shackles on me and now I'm free.
6719993	6723680	So when the announcement came in, I was obviously surprised, but at the same time, I wasn't sad.
6723740	6725624	I was actually kind of glad, not for us, the listeners.
6725664	6730132	We'll still miss listening to OLR each week, whether live or through podcasts, but for you guys and Gal.
6730714	6733519	Loki can focus more on his Minecraft videos and streams.
6733559	6737867	Jamie can push making further strides in her streaming career, not to mention her not-so-secret project.
6738288	6739090	Rob can just live life.
6739130	6740112	That's what I did.
6740132	6740713	So don't worry.
6740913	6742997	You all have a...
6742977	6768428	you all have a great time and enjoy life however you please you don't owe us an explanation we can only thank you again for every moment you gave us of course this ain't the end we'll still talk or chat to each other through whatever means we can and we'll support whatever new projects you are working on we'll see each other around and I wish you the best sorry if this was a long rambling nonsense but that's what I get for writing an email during the live episode and after two full days of playing Pokemon Go
6769285	6771007	Fuck that event in Pokemon Go, by the way.
6771027	6773108	I got 12 shinies across two days.
6773249	6775290	Oh, Rob!
6775411	6780375	No, no, but in playing two hours of a community day, I can get as many shinies.
6780715	6783938	At least I got two unknowns, and I love unknowns.
6783998	6786621	It's probably one of my favorites, so at least there's that.
6787581	6790824	But anyway, thanks for the email, and I really do appreciate the words.
6790844	6796590	To be clear, one thing I am going to lean into, because you kind of said Rob can rest, I don't know if I'll be resting completely.
6796750	6799292	For this year, yes, I will be resting completely.
6799272	6817095	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6817075	6841750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6841730	6862303	I'll still be an individual contributor here at VOG and trying to you know outside of the shows we don't have a lot of meat on the website or on the YouTube right now so I'm going to see what I can do about that because that's something I can do on a timetable that works for me so there you go but I do appreciate the words I really do and I think I think yeah
6863195	6864617	Oh, no, keep going.
6864717	6873489	I was going to say, I think this is just going to be, you know, an evolution into a future that's not as gloomy as it seems.
6875592	6881760	Well, and I'm making a big announcement next week for what's going to happen.
6882213	6909199	but yeah I am really trying to get into my streaming and I'm going to be splitting my time between my streams and ballet and the project that I hope people will be happy about that's all I can say about it because I don't do it just for us we do it for all y'all too alright are there any other emails or just the one?
6909837	6926412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6926392	6927994	Maybe it was 100, 200.
6928334	6929376	I don't know.
6929396	6931118	It was before all games, right?
6931738	6933741	What episode did we merge with all games?
6933841	6935403	That was around 200 or 300, right?
6935763	6936945	I feel like you were here before that.
6936985	6953324	But anyway, I know it's been a very, very long time, and I really appreciate the perspective that you've brought, Deft, because sometimes it's easy to have the blinders on being in the States and just walking into a superstore like a Target or a Walmart.
6953905	6953985	It's
6953965	6954986	humor me for a minute here.
6955006	6969463	I know there's lots of talks about where do we shop right now, but you know, walking into a store and seeing the games on shelves and it's a very different environment when you are in Mexico and you know, it's not necessarily as easy to walk into a gaming store and buy everything.
6969483	6977753	Although it is ironic that finally, after all these years, I did go into a gaming store in Mexico at one point when I was in, I think it was Puerto Vallarta when I was on my cruise a couple of years ago.
6977773	6979635	But, um, it's, it's,
6979615	7006753	Thank you so much for having me.
7006733	7007714	All right.
7009236	7013260	We have a phone call coming on Discord, so I would love to bring this person on.
7013280	7013940	I know, right?
7014521	7015282	Let's go to the phones.
7015322	7016263	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7016303	7019026	Who's this?
7019046	7021268	Hey, it is SSJ100 Matt.
7021448	7022229	Hey, Matt.
7022289	7023470	It is so good to hear from you.
7023490	7024011	How are you?
7024411	7024932	Hi.
7026153	7027294	I'm doing all right.
7028135	7032019	Figured, you know, next week is going to be pretty call busy.
7033200	7036183	And I imagine we're going to probably get a lot of
7036298	7051978	old listeners, maybe, maybe not, but I'd like to call in towards the end of this show to kind of just talk, you know, catch up, just talk with everybody and just, you know, do I have video going?
7053157	7055540	No, we're not getting... Now you do!
7056501	7058504	Now let me switch to the shot with video.
7058824	7063771	Gosh darn it, why does... Please boop that puppy's nose for me.
7063791	7066174	Hold on, I gotta fix the shot so we can actually see Matt.
7066194	7066875	Oh, not that shot.
7067055	7076487	Let's go... Anyway, while I fix things live, as I have to tend to do on this program, well, I appreciate you calling in.
7076507	7080312	You've been with us a very long time, Matt, and I appreciate your...
7080292	7081093	Yeah.
7082034	7101422	Yeah.
7101402	7103564	I wanted to use this opportunity, Matt.
7103624	7109571	You've sent us a couple of bleats over on Blue Sky that I thought were really fucking funny.
7109591	7113715	So I thought I would read some of those for the listeners who maybe haven't heard these yet.
7114115	7120382	So this one says, Did you know Orange Lounge Radio started its record run with its first episode on June 23, 2002?
7121743	7127950	Later that same week, a young wrestler made his debut on June 27, and his name is John Cena.
7127930	7130857	John Cena's final match happens in December.
7130877	7133042	Orange Launch Radio finale will be November 23rd.
7133062	7134765	Well, how about that?
7134786	7135988	We made John Cena quit.
7136109	7137792	Our impact.
7137812	7139115	Just kidding.
7139476	7140358	That's pretty incredible.
7141120	7142343	John Cena got movies, though.
7143746	7143846	Yeah.
7144113	7161026	Also, an OLR, did you know, if you add up every existing episode, including specials of OLR's record run, it's 2,742 hours, 14 minutes, and 44 seconds worth of content, thanks to the OLR archive.
7161467	7164332	Although your autocorrect screwed you up there, but that's all right.
7164312	7173299	If you were to listen to every episode non-stop, it would take you 114 days, 6 hours, and 15 minutes.
7173841	7174864	That's wild.
7174904	7177933	No wonder I'm tired.
7178555	7184440	Well, and what's also funny about that, I don't think last week's show was up yet when you pulled that number.
7184540	7193108	So between last week, tonight, and if next week was a little... If we don't cross 27... 2750, we'll be really close.
7193589	7196992	2750 hours, I bet, we'll end up at by the time this all ends up.
7197032	7197732	Maybe.
7197752	7198353	It'll be close.
7198373	7198853	It'll be close.
7199494	7201916	So, yeah, thank you for the stats.
7202136	7203157	Those are fun to dive into.
7203177	7204779	Yeah, you know what?
7205119	7208562	The reason why I did that was like, I was...
7209368	7239004	I was stuck late at work and I was like trying to think it's like you know like what are some like fun things because there was a show that I really like called Sports Science or something along those lines where they had like they did the science of a lot of sports stuff and I thought about like what are some fun OLR facts so it's like I was looking at some of that and the John Cena thing it's like oh that's fun that's a fun and the hours thing I was kind of like like huh
7239642	7254002	I wonder, like, if, and what I didn't write in the, what I didn't write in the bleat was, um, what if someone were to walk from New York City to LA, just listen to OLR nonstop, how many trips would that take?
7255364	7260791	And, thanks AI, it came up with it, uh, one and a half loops.
7261492	7262173	Wow.
7262879	7278542	Mm-hmm.
7278522	7281746	I mean, there was a bunch of episodes there.
7281786	7286532	I think that some of the things that I kind of threw in there that were on the archive.
7286712	7288034	Okay, okay.
7289456	7291358	Old episodes of DarkSakura's pump up the volume?
7291859	7293261	That was once upon a time.
7293721	7294703	Once upon a time.
7294863	7298708	That's kind of what my stream sort of is now because I just play music in the background.
7299128	7300350	Yeah, it's funny.
7300410	7306858	I mean, if we had things like Outside the Box or USL on there, it would be...
7307885	7311068	Anyways, no, it's just like, you know, like, I fell down a rabbit hole.
7311088	7314752	I have a couple other things that I kind of thought of that I haven't written up.
7314772	7317115	Maybe I'll do that on a fun call next week.
7318216	7318556	Okay.
7318676	7319257	Afterbirths, yeah.
7319717	7329568	But, um, no, but you know, like, like what I wanted to say to kind of back off of DevSea, I really started listening back, like, I guess 2003.
7329828	7334733	And at the time, like, I moved out to go to college in Arizona.
7335354	7336795	Like, I didn't really have, like,
7337450	7365583	any friends, any community, nothing but like I had just gotten into DDR before I left for college and I found you guys thanks to DDR for you and you know I've just stuck around and you know I think we've talked about like legacy before and like the kind of like the things that this show has kind of left behind you know like a lot of people have been inspired by the show so
7366762	7368283	A lot of fun experiences.
7368303	7372727	A lot of fun jokes that we've come up with over the years.
7372847	7377871	But we may not have had the biggest audience.
7377891	7378732	I don't mean we.
7379012	7379713	I'm not part of the show.
7380494	7381535	You are, but yeah.
7381555	7386239	We may not have broken a ton of news or been quoted on any of the major news sites.
7386499	7390702	Well, there was the Katamari thing.
7391163	7393185	No, it's fine.
7393205	7394726	Yeah.
7394746	7396127	But like, you know, like
7396563	7398485	I would argue that we have one of the better communities.
7399746	7400827	I agree.
7401188	7407454	Sometimes there are downsides about being a huge show, and this has been a really cool community, and it's really appreciated.
7407754	7411818	And I appreciate you being here as long as you have, and that's really neat.
7411838	7419866	And a lot of people – I don't know if a lot of people realize this, but even though this show, I kind of say, it was a spinoff of sorts of Under Station Live.
7419886	7420667	That's no secret.
7421688	7425372	Travis taught me that any idiot could podcast, and I say that lovingly.
7425352	7451022	and this show went and then Travis moved to Texas so I no longer participated in the show regularly as I kind of went into this more often but you hosted Under Station Live for a minute because I remember Travis did that whole that whole like be a co-host for a month or so I thought it was a year be a co-host for a month uh and then you you won that contest you got to co-host with him for a
7451002	7453204	It's funny how things are full circle like that.
7453365	7462915	I even came into podcasting because of Under Sedation, not just as a spinoff, but I was filling in, I quote, filling in for Jessica.
7464056	7469723	Nobody ever tell that man's ego I said this, but we're all a part of the Donovan cinematic universe.
7470103	7473307	So here's a question.
7474448	7480975	So is Olar going to end with Rob waking up and Travis coming out of the shower like in Dallas?
7481917	7506068	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7506048	7523263	and I will also be thankful to Travis it's not just this but also DragonCon was he now obviously yes Bobby was a huge part of that too with it being in his backyard but it was Travis that said fucking come I have a room you can stay in it you have you are now out of excuses
7523243	7546517	and got me to start that down that path so um and then I was like why didn't you ever tell me about this it's a lot of fun so um yeah um but anyway I will say Ranma put together something a little cute for the final episode um so please look forward to it of course and like you know the show may be ending
7546733	7548135	You know me.
7548296	7550800	I'm kind of one of your guys' good cheerleaders.
7551040	7554927	I will always support whatever you guys are doing.
7556770	7557170	Either way.
7557331	7566025	Everybody's like... At first I thought it was a sad thing, but it's like... I think I made the comment
7567962	7595995	I think I replied to you with a clip from the last episode of Hannah Montana where she's walking out of the house and it goes, Yeah...
7597510	7597911	Right.
7598111	7612667	Right.
7612647	7633761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7633741	7651395	so I you know I yeah and we will all have projects you can continue to follow and we will all still be following all of you um because many of you have done spin-off projects as an example Ranma and um Anime Jam Session um
7651375	7656543	and somebody opened their mouths last week and hinted that maybe Ranma is a part of what's coming up next.
7656563	7662793	So, you know, obviously, you know, it's great to be able to follow that sort of thing.
7662813	7669223	I've seen Spike and Slidekick in chat tonight and love those guys and appreciate their support over time.
7669244	7675013	And I'm a big fan of the Gameboy.org video game podcast and love the work that those guys are doing.
7675093	7676455	So, you know,
7676603	7683550	Proud, proud parents will be watching you out there, not in a creepy way, but we'll be watching you do your thing and cheering you on.
7683730	7686192	And we'll all have our own things.
7686493	7687914	Jamie will tell you more next week.
7688214	7691297	You know, Matt's got a YouTube and maybe we'll open that up a little more.
7691317	7691578	He does.
7691598	7692479	We'll see if it's up to him.
7692839	7693420	I didn't know.
7693840	7703650	And, you know, even though mine's live hosting, it's still, you know, if you're ever in the area, come check out a show and hopefully some more YouTubes in the future, you know, and that sort of thing.
7703890	7706172	So things I can do in five minutes.
7706877	7710763	I got nothing, but I will, of course, be in chat and call when I can.
7711284	7716091	You've got funny puns, insights, comments, and stats.
7716111	7716672	Stat porn.
7716692	7717073	I try.
7717093	7719296	You know what?
7719456	7723002	I've always kind of tried to call in as much as I can.
7723523	7726327	The thing is, I have such performance anxiety.
7727008	7728390	Even right now, but it's funny.
7728450	7729071	It's stupid.
7730975	7734520	But, you know, I've known you guys for over 20 years.
7734781	7735021	I know.
7735041	7735963	It's like, it's silly.
7735983	7742753	But, you know, like, I've enjoyed the time here, and, you know, like, I look forward to the future, and you know what?
7742773	7749243	Like, if anyone ever wants to, like, listen to all our episodes, we have the archive.
7749643	7750164	Mm-hmm.
7750184	7753970	So it's like, nothing's gone forever.
7753990	7755652	That's right, nothing's gone forever.
7755672	7759378	It's like in physics, nothing goes away, it just changes.
7761164	7765612	and I will hope I can see you if I ever come back to New York.
7765672	7767094	I know you don't live in that area anymore.
7767274	7770119	Married life moved you away, right?
7770139	7771662	So you're not as close as you used to be?
7771722	7773805	I'm closer to Canada.
7774447	7776490	But the thing is, I don't mind driving.
7776470	7794841	Okay, alright That's a four hour drive from me Well, that's not that bad If any of you guys are coming to New York I'm gonna tell you You guys are worth a drive I'm gonna tell you, I said, I'm not gonna go until they have some stuff on Broadway that I really want to see again And now that that Cat's Jellicle Ball is coming to Broadway What?
7794961	7796444	Oh, you didn't know that?
7796464	7800030	No Yeah, the Cat's Jellicle Ball is going to Broadway
7800010	7829325	so I want to see that and I want to see there's another musical well the Romeo and Michelle is being made a musical but I know you're there Ranma but you're not the one on the phone right now yes I'll see you too I will see all the OLR listeners who want to hang out when I'm out there and I still would love to get back to MagFest don't get me wrong it's just it's a really bad time of year that they do that thing oh it is so you know but never say never so yeah I'd love to get out to another con out there at some point I don't know that I want to see that
7829778	7830142	Why?
7830162	7830830	What's wrong with it?
7831497	7833257	Because it's not the original.
7833355	7834517	Oh no, it's not the original.
7834537	7838222	Oh no, it's infused with the 90s Vogue scene.
7838282	7840766	I don't want to hear about anybody not liking cats.
7840906	7841567	Do not tell me.
7841628	7842970	Do not say so in my presence.
7843150	7845994	I will plot.
7846936	7857512	I am excited to see a take on it from a culture that's finally getting its flowers all these years later because Drag Race has ripped it off in many, many different ways.
7857592	7858613	I think it's really exciting.
7858834	7862299	I want to see the fusion of those types of things.
7862279	7864343	My dog is afraid of cats.
7864944	7865345	What's that?
7866728	7867710	My dog is afraid of cats.
7868893	7869714	Well, that's different.
7870796	7877470	Anyway, Matt, any other thoughts you want to get out before we say goodnight?
7878513	7880175	I just want to thank you guys.
7880716	7886084	I'll do a quick call next week because there's going to be a lot of us calling.
7886144	7893595	I'll have something very quick, but what I do want to do right here, right now, is I have my dog right here for the podcast.
7896759	7897801	Ben, can you do me a favor?
7898041	7898502	Can you wave?
7899703	7899924	Wave?
7900865	7901145	Just wave.
7902107	7902868	Just wave to Olar.
7904811	7905111	Olar.
7905597	7923910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7925206	7928853	I know about Spoiled.
7928873	7934363	Alright, Matt, it has been an absolute pleasure and I look forward to continuing to talk to you.
7934383	7937148	This is just one stop on the journey.
7937168	7938230	So until next time, alright?
7939492	7940173	Take care, guys.
7940434	7941055	Take care, buddy.
7941811	7964730	Bye!
7964710	7966056	I absolutely did.
7966076	7968044	I didn't, but it's Thanksgiving week.
7968345	7973808	And I'm like, that's going to be my pet project catching up on things I'm trying to get done in the workplace week.
7973908	7975294	So I'm all right with that.
7975679	7980006	I don't think I'm going to be able to concentrate, to be honest.
7980026	7987157	Plus, the Sunday after that, I have my subathon to help make up for what I spent at TwitchCon.
7988338	7989801	Perfect.
7990762	8002180	I think plans are coming together for my first Sunday off, but I don't know for sure, so I won't say anything until probably next Sunday itself.
8002200	8004403	But yes, I am...
8004383	8005945	planning on a mini trip.
8005965	8006626	We'll say that much.
8006666	8007146	Mini trip.
8007347	8009089	Not a big trip, but a mini trip.
8009609	8013113	I actually do have a new Sunday event that's going to happen come December.
8014115	8017679	I am starting a new ballet class that's all stretching for ballet.
8019421	8022224	So I think it'll be interesting.
8024066	8024807	Feeling motivated.
8025388	8026289	Yeah.
8026309	8026689	That's good.
8027951	8028512	Yeah.
8028532	8028952	All right.
8029613	8033057	Well, are there any other last minute stories tonight, Loki?
8035180	8035641	No?
8035661	8036182	No.
8036202	8038666	I think we hit on all the big stuff.
8038686	8039067	All right.
8039608	8045818	Well, we're at the end of the show, and this is where I would usually say, help us spread the word, tell everybody.
8045958	8047441	And, you know, that is all still true.
8047822	8053832	But I guess this week it would be, help us find the people that used to listen to this show and let them know.
8053852	8054273	Bring them back.
8054513	8055375	Next week is the last show.
8055395	8056817	And we still have a backlog.
8056915	8058117	Yeah.
8058418	8061243	Next week is the big OLR, the final.
8061865	8065652	Really look forward to seeing you all here and doing this one more time for you.
8066393	8075771	We'll let all the sappy stuff out next week, but it's really obviously been a pleasure over these last 23 and a half years and continued in a new form.
8076332	8079278	So until we get to that point next week,
8080439	8081520	We wrap up this week.
8081560	8084523	So DarkSakura, I'm assuming you're streaming as usual tonight.
8084884	8087186	Do you have a final thought or a final thing to say?
8092332	8093713	I have things that I want to say.
8094374	8095295	You have to wait for next week.
8096076	8096356	Alright.
8098318	8098619	Alright.
8099159	8099800	Well, have a good stream.
8099920	8100461	We'll see you next time.
8101061	8101462	Thank you.
8101482	8102103	Bye.
8102123	8102543	Bye-bye.
8103544	8103885	Alright.
8104505	8105907	Loki, that takes us to you.
8105927	8107088	Your final thought tonight.
8107642	8116150	My final thought is that I hopefully will have my new streaming series ready to go by the time I'm available to start streaming again.
8117058	8118139	Alright, nice.
8118760	8119241	I love that.
8119261	8121304	If you can have more time for streaming and stuff, be good.
8123267	8132820	My final thought is it's a little surreal that I'm saying see you next week for the final episode, but it's going to be okay.
8133340	8140250	It's been a long journey, but this is the next fork in the road that's going to lead to some awesome things for everybody.
8141251	8143875	We'll see you next week for the big finale.
8144480	8145762	That's all I got.
8145782	8147104	Until then, have a great night, everybody.
8147304	8167635	Bye.
8168982	8178663	But you know they were all still true.
8181428	8182671	See you next week.
