1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Why bother when we already have a battle net balance?

2
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:21,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to note that when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties.

3
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:26,190
[SPEAKER_06]: This can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items.

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Translation, we don't want credit card companies to prevent you from giving us money you don't have and can't afford.

5
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:35,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Companies are in the business of protecting their ability to continue receiving income no matter the reason.

6
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:41,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:53,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:53,032 --> 00:01:04,885
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live coming at you once again tonight, November the 9th, 2025, episode number 1068 of our program.

11
00:01:05,706 --> 00:01:13,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the last 23 and a half years, we've been joining you here every week to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and sometimes food.

12
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:17,584
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined by my partners in Internet Crime.

13
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:20,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

15
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:21,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, hello.

16
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:22,235
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a thing.

18
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:26,464
[SPEAKER_11]: A thing.

19
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:27,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a thing.

20
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a way.

21
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a certain way.

22
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the way your VTubers dress tonight.

23
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

24
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:38,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing around with some of my Dead by Daylight textures that I have.

25
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:39,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

26
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:41,875
[SPEAKER_11]: How are we feeling about 2v8's return?

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:46,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I don't want to get too much into your gaming week, but... I'll talk about it in my gaming week.

28
00:01:47,363 --> 00:01:47,964
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, fair enough.

29
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:51,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go and say hello to Techmaster Loki.

30
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:53,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

31
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:54,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Loki.

32
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:54,733
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

33
00:01:55,642 --> 00:02:15,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I didn't have...

34
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:20,358
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's CaptainSparklez, he's a big YouTuber.

35
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:27,687
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is, the game I just won the show in the back there is, it's a thing running in Minecraft, so it's called SoulSteal.

36
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:34,776
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's like Sands of Time, it's made by the Nox crew folks who do MCC and stuff.

37
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So they spun off, this is like a bedrock game.

38
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:52,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I always forget that there are the ability to do games within a game or whatever in Minecraft, which is silly of me to forget because I've played them.

39
00:02:53,205 --> 00:03:03,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they had a special limited edition Sonic thing I remember playing for a hot minute, and I'm sure there's all sorts of community-built ones, probably just like ZZT or Fortnite.

40
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,797
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just a million of them out there.

41
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You have the time to sample them.

42
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:25,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I got, the other day they sent me, I had like 10 keys to it or something, I don't know what those are supposed to be for, something to unlock stuff, I guess, and then also I get a creator tag because I've been in MCC, so that'll be fun.

43
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,821
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good times.

44
00:03:28,304 --> 00:03:30,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll get into our gaming weeks here in just a moment.

45
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:34,894
[SPEAKER_11]: But as usual, we'll start off at the top of the show here with our kickoff topic.

46
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:38,800
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, lots of drama going around.

47
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:42,506
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a game you're anticipating very much.

48
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:47,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not anticipating it this much at this point because who knows when it's going to come out.

49
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:49,296
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been like that for years now.

50
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:51,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Brace yourself for mediocrity.

51
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, it's not going to be mediocre.

52
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,302
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it'll be a good game.

53
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:55,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It will.

54
00:03:56,043 --> 00:04:05,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't trust any sort of date announcement for this game until it's actually out because it's just, it's moved so many times now that it doesn't matter.

55
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes, that's what happened.

56
00:04:07,258 --> 00:04:20,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Rockstar Games let everybody know after the last time where they said, it's not moving again, it's not moving again, that, yes, the date has moved again and now has been pushed out even further now about a whole year away.

57
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, for Grand Theft Auto 6.

58
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:29,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they need extra months to polish and finish the game to the level that we expected.

59
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:33,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be damn perfect when it comes out.

60
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:34,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully.

61
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Polish off all of those monetization systems that they're going to build into a multiplayer universe.

62
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:46,587
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they need to really even worry about that because they've already nailed that down.

63
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I think it's going to be

64
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:54,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty amazing whenever it comes out, you know, at some point.

65
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, just real quick, if I can get some comments from chat.

66
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:02,699
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Matt says, they're pushing it back more and more to a future where 90 games are a commonplace.

67
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:08,846
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you say that, but I did think about a little bit of interesting irony.

68
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I think none of this relates to each other.

69
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,551
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting irony.

70
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,572
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we've

71
00:05:13,552 --> 00:05:34,834
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

72
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:55,708
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

73
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:01,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It's potential that a PlayStation 5 could be more expensive than it would be in November.

74
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:06,343
[SPEAKER_11]: It is possible that the price of a PlayStation 5 comes down by the end of November.

75
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So to be... I don't know.

76
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:21,185
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an interesting sort of side effect, especially for people that maybe have been holding out on a PlayStation 5 this entire time until a new Grand Theft Auto game comes out, which I'm sure is more than non-zero.

77
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fair amount of people.

78
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:23,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think...

79
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:27,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't honestly see them... Here's my thought here.

80
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:31,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think that they're going to raise the price of that game.

81
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:34,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that they spent a lot of time on it.

82
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,045
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's why.

83
00:06:35,106 --> 00:06:35,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Because...

84
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,675
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be whoring that microtransaction stuff in the back end.

85
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:54,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So to put an extra $10 wall there between the consumer and somebody that's able to purchase those microtransactions, it doesn't make sense because, one, they're going to get that negative stigma.

86
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,294
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, oh...

87
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:56,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, now it's going up to $90.

88
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:57,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

89
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's going to be $70.

90
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be $70.

91
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's a given.

92
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:02,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

93
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:02,905
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll probably be $80.

94
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,348
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be $80 for sure.

95
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:05,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

96
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,130
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

97
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even remember how much games are anywhere.

98
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:08,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, $80.

99
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Nintendo.

100
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Nintendo, for that.

101
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:11,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

102
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:12,780
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so kind.

103
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:17,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't think that they're going to be the ones that push it more.

104
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:20,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, certainly they could probably try to do that.

105
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:23,937
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's a safer bet to just not do that.

106
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:24,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Lose out.

107
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:42,223
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

108
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:58,120
[SPEAKER_11]: GTA can charge it too some comments in chat about the delay SSJ100Matt says a wise man once said nobody will remember if you fart in public everyone remembers when you shit your pants I think that's exactly how Miyamoto phrased it actually looking back exactly

109
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody will remember the delays if the game is good.

110
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:04,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bobby points out nobody remembers or cares how many times GTA V was delayed.

111
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:07,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the end of the day, there's no complaint.

112
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:08,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get me wrong.

113
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:10,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not complaining about the delay.

114
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Take the time to get it right.

115
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:12,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure it's bug-free.

116
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the game is vast and there's going to be lots of things they have to look at.

117
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:21,772
[SPEAKER_11]: But it does lead to the, hmm, what's that pricing?

118
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,274
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that economic?

119
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:26,719
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more money now that they're fronting for the game.

120
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,820
[SPEAKER_11]: But

121
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,768
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think, I mean, they've made what, a billion dollars off of Grand Theft Auto 5 Online?

122
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:38,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think they make a billion dollars every year at least on that.

123
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an enormous amount of money.

124
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,665
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna make their dev money back, and then some, so don't cry for Rockstar.

125
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,230
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't stop them from acting...

126
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,576
[SPEAKER_11]: A certain kind of way, doesn't Loki?

127
00:08:53,497 --> 00:09:10,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so there's a few, it's a kind of a, he said, she said type thing, or in the sense that you have a corporation saying, Hey, we, uh, we fired, you know, these 30 some employees because of Grossmink's conduct.

128
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:17,280
[SPEAKER_08]: They were, um, they were essentially sharing leaks.

129
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:38,239
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

130
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:45,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly wouldn't be because of that, because according to the folks that are getting fired, they said that is the reason.

131
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:53,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hypothetically, that public forum that you speak of is Discord, which actually I don't think is a hypothetical at all.

132
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was called that it was Discord.

133
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even seen any leaks yet of the game since the last time it was leaked.

134
00:09:58,235 --> 00:09:58,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's...

135
00:09:58,756 --> 00:10:00,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the game, Loki.

136
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:14,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what it is.

137
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:35,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And what if that information, Loki, if we talk about this union and stuff, has nothing to do with the game at all?

138
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,203
[SPEAKER_11]: It is what the working conditions are like for them to make this game.

139
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:51,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Or potentially, maybe it's, you know, Hubbaloo about the game getting delayed or the game is going to be delayed and maybe some of the specifics on a very business scale as to why.

140
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:56,139
[SPEAKER_11]: But not necessarily, you know, graphics, story, plot, play.

141
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:57,180
[SPEAKER_11]: It's none of that.

142
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:02,445
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hypothetically all the shit behind the scenes.

143
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:10,095
[SPEAKER_11]: That lead to, you know, in some type of maybe union growing discord thing, because that's the place where a lot of people collaborate.

144
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:13,119
[SPEAKER_11]: If it was 20 years ago, it would have been Slack.

145
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,621
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's the same.

146
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:20,688
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of companies I know are still on Slack, but off the clock, not as many people on that.

147
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,970
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's...

148
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:28,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when we talk about leaks, I don't think we're talking about character art and level design.

149
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:35,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're talking about the project plan for release and how many hours that's causing us to work.

150
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:36,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's that.

151
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It's things that gaming blogs don't care about.

152
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:41,612
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

153
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:50,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they were in the Discord with the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is the Discord apparently.

154
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:50,826
Yeah.

155
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So then that's it.

156
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,553
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're talking about union-related things.

157
00:11:55,573 --> 00:12:00,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I can see where people are jumping in and saying this is a form of union busting.

158
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:11,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets weird, though, because there's that perspective of technically a private Discord server still lives on a public cloud.

159
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:19,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not taking Rockstar's side here, but that's where on paper they're able to do it.

160
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:32,170
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

161
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:58,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know well and the optics are pretty shitty too right we're gonna fire all these people number one because they're trying to form a union number two right before the game is set to release and we're in that final polish I know it's weird to say that about a game that's a year out but they still they have a long polish and phase so it almost makes it seem like thanks for your long contributions to this game you're no longer needed and now we have this reason to sack you here's what they'll do they'll

162
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:09,987
[SPEAKER_08]: all they'll do is they'll just wait until the game awards which is literally in a month or so and then they'll just drop another trailer and they'll be like oh nobody will talk about this yeah yeah yeah

163
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unfortunately.

164
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:21,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you would... It's interesting you bring up the Game Awards because I feel like there was a lot of pressure last year for Jeff to kind of comment on the industry.

165
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:31,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder, you know, and I guess this is a silly thing to say, but, you know, I wonder if maybe there will be something said this year, but I also think we already know the answer.

166
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,915
[SPEAKER_08]: He sort of mentioned something like, what is that, Summer Games Fest?

167
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,396
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like barely...

168
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:40,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, basically saying, like, hey, look at what these indie studios are doing.

169
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at all this amazing stuff.

170
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:44,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was more trying to hype the positive.

171
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:45,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, because that's what it is.

172
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,479
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to get up there on a night that you're trying to celebrate video games and say, wow, this industry is kind of going down the shitter.

173
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of taking the negative side, you're taking the positive side by uplifting and saying, these indie games are great.

174
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is... And by the way, this is why Claire Obscure is going to sweep.

175
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:03,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I...

176
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:17,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there is... It's not just the fact that that game is rock solid, but I think a lot of the ways that game was made, even though, yes, I realize there were certain outsourced teams involved and so forth.

177
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:20,687
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of games that you hear about now.

178
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:25,215
[SPEAKER_11]: At least it wasn't AI that are made.

179
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

180
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of sad we have to say that.

181
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:32,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, wait till a later story.

182
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:37,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Just file that on a little index card in the back of your head because we're going to pull that later in the show.

183
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:41,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, let's see.

184
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:45,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Over at our Twitch chat, over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

185
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:50,217
[SPEAKER_11]: So Bobby is pointing out some of the behind-the-scenes stuff about the union.

186
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:55,022
[SPEAKER_11]: They were just about able to get to 10% membership to be able to collect a bargain.

187
00:14:55,362 --> 00:15:01,269
[SPEAKER_11]: They are now not close to the 10% membership anymore, and others are scared to join to get to that 10%.

188
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:09,057
[SPEAKER_11]: That all plays into that optics that really, like, it makes this whole you leaked confidential information a real stretch.

189
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:14,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if, you know, again, this is UK law from what it sounds like, not US law.

190
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:17,629
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not going to, I mean, I barely know shit when it comes to US law.

191
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,691
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to profess to know what's going on in the UK.

192
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:31,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wonder if anyone takes this to a legal place to see what ends up, you know, if it is arbitrated or whatever, whether Discord, a private Discord is indeed a public forum.

193
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:37,656
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be an interesting, because that's the whole technicality this whole thing is resting on.

194
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:38,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be interesting.

195
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:44,273
[SPEAKER_11]: SJ100Matt says, firing team leaders and managers throws everything out of whack as well.

196
00:15:44,293 --> 00:15:47,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody knows who they're reporting to and yeah, gonna delay stuff.

197
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Just ask the federal government.

198
00:15:49,334 --> 00:16:16,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I added that last part let's see, Def says it's going to be hilarious to hear Jeff talk about the industry and how the workforce makes it happen and then give GTA a platform that's why I preface what I said this is probably a stupid thing to say but when's that stopped me before Bobby Blackwolf says this game was made by one guy with nine friends no bitch, that's ten people look

199
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:20,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley is a pretty face, not a mathematician.

200
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:24,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's allow him to stay in his lane, okay?

201
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,284
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an adorable little Canadian man that's done a lot in games.

202
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,205
[SPEAKER_07]: He just wants to host a show.

203
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:29,686
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

204
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:30,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Just let him host a show.

205
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:39,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Adorable little Canadian boy wearing dad's sport coat hosting a giant game trailer exhibition on a big stage.

206
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't see Brian Seacrest do math.

207
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,455
[SPEAKER_08]: He shouldn't have to do math either.

208
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:47,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley is kind of the Ryan Seacrest of the games industry, though.

209
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Just just marrying it.

210
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:51,345
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a that was a very Linda Richmond type of moment.

211
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:52,827
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the Clint.

212
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:53,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a topic.

213
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeff Keighley.

214
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,319
[SPEAKER_11]: The Seacrest of the maybe Jeff Keighley hosts Wheel of Fortune next.

215
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:01,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

216
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Mish says my favorite games this year have been Dinkum.

217
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:06,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Dinkum.

218
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I hardly knew him.

219
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:14,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Ghosts of Yotai and Tales of Shilya

220
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure what my favorite is.

221
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played them all yet.

222
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:19,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a minute.

223
00:17:19,563 --> 00:17:20,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Give me a minute.

224
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:24,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we still have Metroid Prime 4 is still going to come out.

225
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:31,942
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have to do a follow-up at some point because as we all know, it's riding off into the sunset at the end of the month.

226
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:34,866
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will be curious if Metroid Prime 4 lives up to the hype.

227
00:17:35,007 --> 00:17:37,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope as a Metroid Prime fan it does.

228
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,572
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see.

229
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:43,800
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like there's still some room for talk on what the best game of the year is.

230
00:17:44,438 --> 00:18:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: although we should be getting Game Award nominees that'll probably be the headline our last episode because that's right about the week the week before Thanksgiving is when we get the nominees right because or is that that's right around the time the nominee the games have to come out but a lot of I think we know the journalists get advanced copies of those games so the eligibility window is like Black Friday but I think the nominees come out that week the week before Thanksgiving so um

231
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:22,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, NSJ100Matt says, settling with those employees via lawsuit is cheaper than dealing with the union and GASP pay people well and fairly.

232
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Ouch!

233
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:27,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Truth detected.

234
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:28,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else on that, Loki?

235
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:32,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no.

236
00:18:32,336 --> 00:18:33,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing more on that.

237
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:34,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing more on that.

238
00:18:35,080 --> 00:19:02,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go to the Game Awards, oddly I don't think I'll be able to There's a lot of things going on at work and that's right in the middle of the week I'd have to take like two days in the middle of the week to like because I can't trust that I'd be able to fly down there so I'd have to drive down there I've been hearing so many horror stories It would be nice to go once, though I want to go to the Game Awards just to say I went so, I don't know We'll see

239
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

240
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:21,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I did play 2v8 for Dead by Daylight.

241
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:37,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yesterday, just on my first match, I just was solo queuing it, just because, and met some really fun people who were group streaming and playing together, and they invited me in, and we had a really good time, and I now have new friends.

242
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:52,928
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

243
00:19:55,118 --> 00:20:19,067
[SPEAKER_01]: P100 Pig

244
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:36,499
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

245
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I did not play any Avatar this week.

246
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:42,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of didn't feel like it.

247
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:43,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Palia.

248
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:45,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I beat Portal 2.

249
00:20:45,948 --> 00:21:01,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've mentioned the crap going on with my hand, but it is hard to do fine control when a good quarter of your hand hurts from the bone, it feels like.

250
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:04,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really the tendon, but it feels like it's coming from the bones.

251
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:33,958
[SPEAKER_01]: so I've had a hard time playing but I did manage to beat the game and I love that game but now I have to think of something different to play next week what else oh yeah I have to thank Ryan who Shay's a Scotsman for gifting me Repo I am going to be starting that before too long oh cute yeah so

252
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to think of a different retro game for next Saturday now.

253
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:42,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means using my brain and thinking and none of those things work.

254
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:46,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I had good suggestions for you.

255
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'll have some retro stuff.

256
00:21:50,354 --> 00:21:52,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just have to go hunting.

257
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:53,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll go to Loki.

258
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,360
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week?

259
00:21:55,268 --> 00:22:22,423
[SPEAKER_08]: it's mostly been just trying to a lot of stuff actually I've been doing a lot of administrative stuff with the Minecraft server that I'm on so moving stuff around migrating our server to a different host server candidate stuff modeling a trophy for my Halloween decorating contest that I did um

260
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:45,373
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah just playing Minecraft stuff and I did play a little bit more of the Once Upon a Katamari I'm having trouble having that game hold my interest though which is unfortunate because I really wanted it to be good it's just they put too many blockers in the way to make it fun I guess but I don't know we'll try it some more I'll figure something out

261
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:47,052
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

262
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:53,345
[SPEAKER_11]: For my gaming week, I've been continuing with Dragon Quest 1 HD a little bit.

263
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:59,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Did not play much more of the Mortal Kombat theme because the game that's been sucking all my time, surprise, surprise, Diablo 4.

264
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's a reason for it.

265
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:06,552
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of doing the equivalent of like Dark Sakura P100-ing characters in Dead by Daylight.

266
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:10,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of going like as far as you can literally go in Diablo 4 with the current season.

267
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:16,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I am like one or two quests away from completely finishing all of the season's quests.

268
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:19,207
[SPEAKER_11]: That's far beyond the Battle Pass stuff that I'm already done with.

269
00:23:19,307 --> 00:23:23,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It's finishing like the most difficult challenges in the quest and unlocking like every reward.

270
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I have never done that in any of the ten seasons.

271
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:29,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always finished the Battle Pass, but never gone all the way to do the ultimate challenges.

272
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:45,567
[SPEAKER_11]: This build that I'm doing right now, the Hydra Wizard, is so good that I am... Because there's some new items that make the Hydra Wizard super powerful, and I am two quests away from literally unlocking everything you can possibly unlock, including the most ultimate stuff this season.

273
00:23:45,547 --> 00:24:07,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 4

274
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:17,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the fact that they do this limited XP and gold boost somewhat predictably is actually kind of ruining the game in a way.

275
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for me now, I only want to play when that buff is active.

276
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would I play otherwise?

277
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:26,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't I play unless I'm getting the maximum amount of XP?

278
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:35,365
[SPEAKER_11]: So Blizzard needs to, I think, rethink the way they're doing this Mother's Embrace boost because either they just need to do it all the time

279
00:24:35,345 --> 00:25:05,318
[SPEAKER_11]: which I know might sound wild but you know they've got another expansion coming they're gonna raise the Paragon level cap they're gonna be able to rethink you know how the XP distribution is or they need to just stop doing it all together except for like like one day Halloween and like other things that you know you would expect maybe the actual anniversary day things like that like otherwise they need to stop doing it this way because it's just as much as I love this game it just makes me go I'm only gonna play when that buff is up because that's when I'm gonna be able to maximize my time

280
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:05,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

281
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:14,519
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you enjoy actually playing the game, why can't you play at any time and when the boost is up and just playing for fun?

282
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, and that's true.

283
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:22,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And especially from a multiplayer perspective, like if some of the other people I know, like Grandpa Warcraft actually plays Diablo 4.

284
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he wanted me to be like, hey, jump on and help me grind this boss loot, I'd do it, whether the buff's up or not.

285
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:36,486
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just kind of go, the accomplishment I want to get is all the shinies, and the best way for me to do the shinies is during the event.

286
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:52,197
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not to say I would never would I ever play the game the other times but I kind of go those are my times to play everything else that's on my backlog that's kind of why Diablo is more front of mind this week and maybe some of the other games took a backseat

287
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,123
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

288
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,625
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's pretty much it for my game week.

289
00:25:55,705 --> 00:26:04,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I may have something to show here in a minute because Alan was just at Costco and I just heard or I got the notification he just got home with the garage door.

290
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:08,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know he bought me something as he sent me a picture and I was like, oh, I want that.

291
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,577
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll show you all in a minute here as soon as I see it.

292
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:16,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I did have one more thing I was going to mention.

293
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:33,484
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was brought to my attention, thank you, DarkTetsuya, that Taki Udon, the guy that's behind the Super Station, it's like a FPGA emulation box that looks like a PlayStation 1.

294
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:37,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were looking for homebrew games to put on it.

295
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So I submitted Pixel Hoops number two, and it's going to be on it.

296
00:26:41,587 --> 00:26:52,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever he releases the hardware Holy shit, good for you, that's great Yeah, it'll be cool Is the hardware something on Amazon, or where will I get the hardware?

297
00:26:53,204 --> 00:27:06,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on Taki Udon's site, so it's retroremake.co Love that It's the Superstation 1

298
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:15,804
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, and Alan just brought me what he bought me at Costco, and it's another little mini arcade, although this one seems a little bit more durable.

299
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:18,908
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a Sonic the Hedgehog My Arcade.

300
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:19,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that.

301
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just there yesterday.

302
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,372
[SPEAKER_11]: This one's pretty durable, though.

303
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:25,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike the other My Arcades, it has a more – that's why this is $10 more probably.

304
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:30,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a more solid front to it to keep this weighted down so you can actually play it a lot better.

305
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:33,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And that stick that's in there – let me get it better in frame.

306
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,573
[SPEAKER_11]: For those on the podcast feed –

307
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:42,364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a mini arcade machine, meaning the type that sits on yourself, or shelf, or on yourself.

308
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:43,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a big stick on it.

309
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:50,478
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got a big old stick that actually looks a little bit more like what you would see in an arcade, maybe of a baby style, and then some buttons on it.

310
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:53,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says it has Sonic 1 and 2 are built into that.

311
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I bought Sonic the Hedgehog again.

312
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:56,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Woo!

313
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:58,030
[SPEAKER_11]: But I actually, this is pretty cool.

314
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:00,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many batteries this thing takes.

315
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:03,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume it's still just a few double A's.

316
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because the base is weighty and has that big control doesn't mean it's going to take more battery power.

317
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

318
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, that's my little special thing.

319
00:28:12,575 --> 00:28:13,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I get to set up later.

320
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun.

321
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

322
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:18,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

323
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo Infinite, it's just about done getting updates.

324
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:35,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So this next major update, Operation Infinite, will be the last update that it receives, which has been confirmed by Halo Studios in a brand new blog post.

325
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, they have all their other projects that they're going to be working on.

326
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:44,018
[SPEAKER_08]: They've teased multiple games in the pipeline.

327
00:28:43,998 --> 00:29:03,289
[SPEAKER_08]: and says as we look ahead your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals in hopes of succeeding expectations and delivering the best Halo experiences possible and the game of course is not being shut down it's just not being developed any further so you know make that kind of clear

328
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:31,673
[SPEAKER_08]: but yeah of course we know that Halo Campaign Evolved is coming as well and then there's also going to be some other games as well they're going to be shifting their their dev teams too so neat that's still being I completely forgot about Halo Infinite since you know I know when it initially launched it was rough but it's cool I guess it's been supported this long but

329
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:34,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it was supposed to be a 10-year game, Loki.

330
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:36,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Halo Infinite, meaning forever.

331
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, forever.

332
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I guess four years is the new 10 years.

333
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you think about it, like, you know... Can we apply that to Term Limits?

334
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:54,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we apply that to Term Limits?

335
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

336
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:01,921
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all aged 10 years in this last four years, so it only makes sense that the game is done.

337
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:02,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

338
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:04,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

339
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:04,873
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

340
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:12,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would say sorry to the Halo fans, but we just had that news last week about the Halo, you know, reboot or whatever on PS5.

341
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:13,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

342
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: They're working on more Halo 4.

343
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:14,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

344
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,084
[SPEAKER_08]: You can calm down.

345
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:28,796
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a, and that is going to be definitely a palette reset to, you know, see how this Halo thing kind of lands when everybody can play this no matter what they're playing on.

346
00:30:28,816 --> 00:30:30,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for Nintendo, I guess.

347
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:31,478
Mm-hmm.

348
00:30:31,880 --> 00:31:00,807
[SPEAKER_08]: but it'll be very interesting to see how that sort of maybe resets how many people are active in Halo multiplayer lobbies except now that I'm saying that out loud I think a big sticking point of Halo the new one is that there is no multiplayer it's really only the campaign I'm thinking like the Don Mattrick quote you know where they're talking about like you know if you can't afford the Xbox One the Xbox 360 is for you it's like if you can't play Halo you know remastered or whatever it is Splatoon 3 is for you

349
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:28,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh lord I had more fun with Splatoon 3 than recent Halo games That is a gross comparison You got Metroid Prime 4 I was going to say, it is, because Splatoon 3 is really fun Halo is out after a while I'd rather play Splatoon anyway

350
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god, what was the crappy game?

351
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,655
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a Metroid spin-off, but it was like something Force.

352
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:36,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just awful.

353
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:41,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a PvP Metroid game, but didn't even call itself Metroid.

354
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:43,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, the Strike Force thing on the DS?

355
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, something like that.

356
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:46,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Strike Team Force or whatever it was?

357
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know, I remember which Strike Force.

358
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:50,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Federation Force.

359
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Numerous chatters popping in with that, yeah.

360
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:55,159
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

361
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:07,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so I'm going to ask DarkSakura to get ready to pull that index card I had her set in her brain earlier in the show because we're going to talk about, unfortunately, Square Enix is making some layoffs.

362
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:14,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a total surprise because I believe we had a headline a few weeks ago that was talking about this possibility that was going to happen.

363
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:24,726
[SPEAKER_11]: So of course, Square Enix, and you know them through Final Fantasy, but I think it's important for this story to really understand they make a lot more than just Final Fantasy.

364
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:32,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, for example, didn't Square Enix make, speaking of Splatoon-y games, didn't Square Enix make that game, oh god, Shane made me play it.

365
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:33,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Foam Stars.

366
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,079
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a Square Enix game, right?

367
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:47,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So, they make a lot of games that you don't usually associate with the JRPG brand, which is exactly what you're gonna realize the rest of the story is.

368
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:48,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

369
00:32:48,736 --> 00:33:00,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've decided that they're going to be laying off an undisclosed amount of employees, specifically North America and European publishing operations, as it looks to streamline all of that.

370
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:06,374
[SPEAKER_11]: They already said in a presentation to investors that this was going to happen.

371
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:17,325
[SPEAKER_11]: "...in the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency."

372
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:22,995
[SPEAKER_11]: They're looking to save about 19.6 million, that's 3 billion yen, from this restructuring.

373
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:29,386
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to consolidate the HD Games publishing organization from 11 divisions down to 4.

374
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I had no idea they had 11 divisions.

375
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:35,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be very curious what that means for the games themselves.

376
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:40,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, they are not disclosing how many employees that totals.

377
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:58,585
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.

378
00:33:58,565 --> 00:34:04,310
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of mystique in what they're saying there with all that.

379
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:12,758
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, granted, it sounds like they're going to take publishing a little more worldwide, which I mean, in some ways we do live in a worldwide market.

380
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:21,386
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would anticipate that probably some things you see that are a little more outside the Japanese focus games are probably going to get hit a little bit.

381
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:26,210
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, where's my Rad Racer 3 Square Enix?

382
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,650
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

383
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:28,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's...

384
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:46,341
[SPEAKER_11]: where's our Chrono Trigger remake in the Octopath engine that has served them so well for like Live Alive and Dragon Quest and all these fucking other games so anyway YYR does point out granted Square used to make a lot of really great non-RPG games

385
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:47,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Such as Rad Racer, right?

386
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:50,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember when they were firing on all cylinders on PS1?

387
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:55,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Bushido Blade, Einhander, Tabal, Urgeis, and others.

388
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:55,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Great point.

389
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,755
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably when we came up with 11 publishing arms.

390
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:02,319
[SPEAKER_11]: D'Artizia says, there's a new one, blanking on the name.

391
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Def says, where's Theatrhythm final bar for PC?

392
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,164
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great fucking question.

393
00:35:07,545 --> 00:35:10,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Theatrhythm, I hope we still get more Theatrhythm.

394
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:11,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

395
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to go back and play more, to be quite honest.

396
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:39,514
[SPEAKER_11]: now here's something else going on kind of in tandem with this whole thing and that is that Square Enix is going to be using generative AI to automate 70% of game Q&A or Q&A not that kind of Q&A game quality assurance QA by 2027 this is interesting let's

397
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:43,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually want to hear this out a little bit because I think this could be interesting.

398
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:47,745
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be using Gen AI to automate 70% of Game QA.

399
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:51,290
[SPEAKER_11]: This was all part of the financial results.

400
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:57,058
[SPEAKER_11]: There is what's called the Joint Development of Game QA Automation Technology using Generative AI.

401
00:35:57,078 --> 00:36:02,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And what they'll be doing is they're going to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks in game development by the end of 2027.

402
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:07,392
[SPEAKER_11]: And they hope to establish a competitive advantage in game development.

403
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:10,836
[SPEAKER_11]: and of course, you know, AI is a pretty controversial thing.

404
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:12,138
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that.

405
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:15,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I'm, and this may surprise you.

406
00:36:15,722 --> 00:36:19,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little hesitant to dog on this right now.

407
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:28,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think that I'm ready to dog on it when it needs to be, but I think we need to sort of see, because what's important to note, the layoff story did not talk about QA.

408
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:30,819
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, that was publishing things like that.

409
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was not specifically talking about QA.

410
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:52,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this could be interesting if the part of Q&A is running certain game loops and exploring certain game loops over and over again that could be interesting to see how automation could accelerate that that being said Square Enix would be a much better company

411
00:36:52,816 --> 00:37:04,128
[SPEAKER_11]: if it were to upskill these particular workers that are doing QA right now to be able to fix some of these bugs that are maybe, let's say, the low-hanging fruit.

412
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm grossly simplifying this, I will admit.

413
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:10,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm making this sound like a turn the graphics up on level three type of scenario.

414
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:22,047
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I mean is that if they could actually provide more of these employees the toolkits to actually be helping to fix some of the bugs that AI identifies, this entire process would probably speed up significantly.

415
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:31,328
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think something important as we all groan when we hear that AI is going to be doing the QA, most of this is outsourced anyway.

416
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:55,797
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

417
00:37:55,777 --> 00:38:14,916
[SPEAKER_11]: AI to uh so we can fire people and lower the numbers I really truly believe you get what you pay for in that regard and if instead they were to let's have AI try to identify some of these repetitive game loops and and discover the low-hanging fruit so that our QA team can tackle how to fix the problem

418
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:38,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, for sure, for sure.

419
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:40,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

420
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:45,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, like I said, I'm all for assistive, not generative.

421
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: SGO 100 Matt says, correct.

422
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:57,300
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of Q&A is outsourced to different companies on contract jobs.

423
00:38:57,321 --> 00:38:58,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

424
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:58,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

425
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:00,438
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

426
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:12,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we'll see what develops with this and what this ultimately means in the next couple of years, because I mean, it will be interesting if games are released with AI, whatever quality, and they're still buggy.

427
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:17,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just going to be interesting to see what all develops from that.

428
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,043
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

429
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:22,227
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on and talk about and seven day happened this week, right?

430
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:22,988
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura?

431
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:24,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

432
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:28,816
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a Mass Effect holiday, except there wasn't much to celebrate this year, but a little bit, a little bit.

433
00:39:29,437 --> 00:39:29,537
Yeah.

434
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:48,876
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

435
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:54,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be set after the original trilogy, so we probably won't have Shepard.

436
00:39:55,747 --> 00:39:57,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to tell us which ending is canon?

437
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,480
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a little bit of an update about the next game.

438
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still in development.

439
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,548
[SPEAKER_01]: EA and Bioware are still going to be pushing this out.

440
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,075
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from a blog post by Mike Gamble.

441
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,437
[SPEAKER_01]: He is quite insane.

442
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:22,611
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at Bioware, but the team is heads down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect.

443
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:28,100
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of universe to cover, a lot of features to build, and a lot of romances to figure out.

444
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,462
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as Garrus is in it!

445
00:40:30,124 --> 00:40:30,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kidding.

446
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:33,409
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah...

447
00:40:34,874 --> 00:40:39,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like they're just trying to let us know it's still going to happen.

448
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:41,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Still going to happen.

449
00:40:41,823 --> 00:40:42,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the TV show.

450
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:51,476
[SPEAKER_11]: With all the news around EA recently, I appreciate the reinforcement because I think there was a part of that that maybe was in question a little bit.

451
00:40:51,496 --> 00:40:52,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the reinforcement.

452
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:58,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they're just going to be CGing the non-humans, you know.

453
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:05,924
[SPEAKER_01]: or if the whole thing will be like a CG deal, you know, how are they going to do Turians?

454
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Henson puppetry.

455
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:08,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Make it happen.

456
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:10,416
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want.

457
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure that's going to happen.

458
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:16,776
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not, but let me live my fantasy.

459
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:39,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, speaking of Jim Henson puppetry, there is something, look, if you are a gay man or live your life like one, let me tell you, there's something even more exciting in media that just got announced this week, way more so than the Mass Effect TV series, and that is that Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone are co-producing a Miss Piggy film

460
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:40,666
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

461
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:47,811
[SPEAKER_11]: That Cole Escola, the screenwriter and star of Oh Mary on Broadway is writing.

462
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

463
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:51,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, right?

464
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:55,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Gay gasps heard around the world on that one.

465
00:41:55,933 --> 00:42:00,899
[SPEAKER_11]: That is gay culture, is that headline I just read to you.

466
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:03,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

467
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:15,976
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nice to know in this incredibly shitty year where my marriage may once again be up for debate at the Supreme Court that I have something to look forward to in my life, so let me have this Miss Piggy movie, goddammit.

468
00:42:15,996 --> 00:42:18,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me have something to look forward to.

469
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

470
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I had a little asterisk as well.

471
00:42:24,456 --> 00:42:25,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a small N7 update.

472
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:30,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't expect to be on Jamie's radar, but it was definitely on mine because it's a game I follow.

473
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:37,170
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are a No Man's Sky person, the special Normandy expedition is back.

474
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,776
[SPEAKER_11]: They launched it on N7 day and it's only running for maybe another week or so.

475
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:43,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say it was maybe through the 18th.

476
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:52,652
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you don't have your Normandy in No Man's Sky and you own that game, I would encourage, especially those of you that picked it up on Switch, I don't know if you've had the chance to get it yet.

477
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:54,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that might be Mish in that boat.

478
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:55,997
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some other folks out there.

479
00:42:56,497 --> 00:42:58,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to do it.

480
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fairly quick expedition.

481
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:02,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And by fairly quick, I mean it's still going to be a few hours.

482
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:04,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it at all.

483
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:10,119
[SPEAKER_11]: I might... Well, if you struggle a little bit, I'll help you out.

484
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,208
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't remember it being a super difficult expedition, but yeah, you're going to have to kind of get the feel of the game.

485
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:22,116
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you can get to Normandy in No Man's Sky for about another week and a half or so.

486
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you start the expedition.

487
00:43:24,158 --> 00:43:31,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually, you have to start the expedition, and then you might have another three or four days past the end date, but you want to get it started, if nothing else.

488
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:32,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So just...

489
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a courtesy announcement for those of you out there.

490
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:45,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's still a Game Pass thing, too, if your Game Pass hasn't already run out with everything, which I don't fault you for if you let that cancel.

491
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:45,669
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

492
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:50,997
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, I believe, a Game Pass thing still, too, so you can get it in that ecosystem.

493
00:43:51,017 --> 00:43:55,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm noticing Bobby in chat says, I lost the rewards on PS5, so I might have to redo the expedition.

494
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:56,946
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, there you go.

495
00:43:58,148 --> 00:43:59,570
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on.

496
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

497
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,929
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's talk.

498
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like a misconnection a little bit.

499
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:11,122
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there was a comment by Keanu Reeves a while back.

500
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:21,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, not that far back, but basically saying he would love to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand in the next Cyberpunk game.

501
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:29,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we have, you know, the developers of said Cyberpunk game saying...

502
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:33,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Hit us up!

503
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:37,658
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully, hopefully we can make something work.

504
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:38,460
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah.

505
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:41,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

506
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Johnny Silverhand was an awesome character.

507
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:49,825
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd love to see what Keanu Reeves could do for another game.

508
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:57,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Keanu Reeves was that cyberpunk reboot through the bad and the good.

509
00:44:57,729 --> 00:45:05,123
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the whole announcement where somebody in the crowd had shouted, you're beautiful, and he goes, no, you're beautiful.

510
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:05,824
[SPEAKER_02]: That was that, right?

511
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:07,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it was.

512
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Keanu Reeves really embodies that series at this point.

513
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:13,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize it didn't start with him, but it's his now.

514
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:19,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I do hope that if they continue with what's going on in the Cyberpunk universe, which I think they will.

515
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I do feel like Cyberpunk's had enough of a victory lap of sorts between the Switch 2 release.

516
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:27,268
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of redeemed itself.

517
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,170
[SPEAKER_11]: As some video games get to do.

518
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,372
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Cyberpunk's been able to run that victory lap.

519
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:34,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that if they explore the future, they do it with Keanu Reeves.

520
00:45:34,516 --> 00:45:35,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Because like...

521
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:52,414
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

522
00:45:52,394 --> 00:46:14,402
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

523
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:40,373
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

524
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:42,258
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what continues with that.

525
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:43,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, it was breathtaking.

526
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Mike Deft says you're breathtaking.

527
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:46,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

528
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:48,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Neil Patrick Harris as well.

529
00:46:48,927 --> 00:46:50,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

530
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike.

531
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:56,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Spike, from GameBooey.org, Video Game Podcast.

532
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:58,681
[SPEAKER_11]: So lovely to see you in chat.

533
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:06,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Reminds that Matthew Lillard also had a role in the Twin Peaks reboot, which it was a small role, but it was an important one.

534
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:07,453
[SPEAKER_11]: He was very good in that.

535
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:10,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I support anything related to Twin Peaks.

536
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:34,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't watched too much of Twin Peaks but I know my other cast members on Channel 64 enjoy watching Twin Peaks because it's strange and so there will be many nights that we are in voice chat together and he's streaming Twin Peaks for us to watch and it's strange and it doesn't make any sense to me but it's

537
00:47:33,982 --> 00:47:52,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I fucking love Twin Peaks I would encourage everybody to at least watch the original pilot and keep in mind you have to keep in mind in the back of your mind when you watch the pilot it aired on TV in 1989, 1990 I don't remember the exact day I think it was maybe early April 1990 I was in middle school and I tried to watch it in middle school

538
00:47:52,493 --> 00:48:22,500
[SPEAKER_11]: and when you watch it you're gonna be kind of taken with two things you're gonna be like this is very slow moving and very like intentional but also extremely unsettling it's extremely unsettling television and you kind of go this set the tone for so much more that's come after it there is so much that is influenced by what Twin Peaks did and you know and then if you ever watch the episode that reveals Laura's killer which I think we all know the answer to that now but I will I will

539
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Let you have that.

540
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:27,467
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know, I will let you have that.

541
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:38,281
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will say the whole sequence where that is played out and that is revealed is one of the scariest, most unsettling, most fucked up things.

542
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:41,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot believe that aired on television, to be quite honest.

543
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:43,508
[SPEAKER_11]: In the 90s, nonetheless.

544
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:46,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It was event television.

545
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: The second season of Twin Peaks after that point...

546
00:48:51,438 --> 00:49:16,416
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

547
00:49:16,396 --> 00:49:18,239
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie's really not in a bad way.

548
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:23,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just really like the topics and what's at hand is very unsettling.

549
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:25,970
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you can get through it, the movie's powerful.

550
00:49:26,371 --> 00:49:34,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's one of those things that time has done that movie a lot of favors, like a lot of movies that sort of got rejected by audiences on the first go.

551
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:36,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, that's my Twin Peaks rant.

552
00:49:36,847 --> 00:49:38,790
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad I could get one more in before it's all over.

553
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:39,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody should watch Twin Peaks.

554
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:41,574
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the best television shows of all time.

555
00:49:41,694 --> 00:49:41,894
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

556
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:43,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

557
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:45,019
All right.

558
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:48,343
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, but Rob, Twin Peaks was on at 10 p.m.

559
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:50,085
[SPEAKER_11]: You could get away with a lot in that time slot.

560
00:49:50,105 --> 00:49:50,566
[SPEAKER_11]: You right.

561
00:49:52,508 --> 00:49:54,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Captain Spike says, it's intense, but so good.

562
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:55,993
[SPEAKER_11]: The movie, Fire Walk With Me.

563
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:57,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not get it as a kid.

564
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:02,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, number one, you probably shouldn't have watched it as a kid, but I get it.

565
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:04,083
[SPEAKER_11]: We all watch things we shouldn't have.

566
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:11,713
[SPEAKER_11]: But number two, yes, a lot like would have gone over my head at that age that I think now it's like, oh, this is very disturbing.

567
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:13,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway.

568
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:39,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a proper Twin Peaks video game I don't not that I think that would I think like Alan Wake is the closest I'm ever going to get and you know I realize it also be really weird with David Lynch no longer with us unfortunately I feel like something not sort of endorsed directly by him would feel wrong but you know in a perfect world we would have got we will discover that he wrote a treatment for a video game before he passed but I just don't expect that that's the case

569
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:41,978
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, now I'm done.

570
00:50:42,218 --> 00:50:43,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about Steam.

571
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:49,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about the place that you could buy all of these video games that are hypothetical in my mind.

572
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:51,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Steam is one of those places.

573
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:54,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And Steam's been doing some updates lately.

574
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,242
[SPEAKER_11]: They've done a few things recently and now they're doing another.

575
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,965
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new look and feel.

576
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:04,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Pages are now wider with support for higher resolution images.

577
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:07,775
[SPEAKER_11]: So those of y'all with 4K monitors, Steam's catching up here.

578
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:10,738
[SPEAKER_11]: New viewing modes for trailers and screenshots.

579
00:51:10,758 --> 00:51:13,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And now there's some new formatting options.

580
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:16,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Pages have been widened to 1200 pixels.

581
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:21,730
[SPEAKER_11]: That means now they can show more content on screen without overwhelming the page.

582
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:29,745
[SPEAKER_11]: and there's a large pop-up view called the theater mode as well as a full screen mode for trailers and things like that.

583
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:33,521
[SPEAKER_11]: No new look on the homepage yet.

584
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:37,786
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just games store pages and bundle detail pages.

585
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:51,480
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, considering Steam launched in an era where people didn't have widescreen monitors on the whole, and now I think widescreens have been the standard for quite some time, you know, and 4Ks are more and more.

586
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not everybody has them, but there's still more and more than they were.

587
00:51:55,564 --> 00:51:57,066
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's...

588
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably smart that the Steam store has evolved to match that a little bit.

589
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:05,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the theater mode is really good, too, for the trailers and screenshots to really get a sense of what does this look like.

590
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,575
[SPEAKER_11]: And plus, we're going to have a Steam sale in what?

591
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:09,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Friday is what?

592
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:10,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Three weeks away?

593
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should have a Thanksgiving or holiday, whatever they call it.

594
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,008
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

595
00:52:13,988 --> 00:52:17,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Holiday is going to be through all the end of the year events.

596
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:18,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.

597
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:20,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there'll be a Black Friday, Cyber Monday sale.

598
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,273
[SPEAKER_11]: There always is.

599
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:25,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to think of what I might pick up on a sale like that.

600
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:27,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think of what I missed throughout the year.

601
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:49,125
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to get Claire Obscure because I'm letting Xbox Game Pass go so I'm probably gonna have to pick Claire Obscure is good yeah no I know I just didn't finish it so I'm gonna have to buy it to finish it I also I'm gonna have to buy No Man's Sky if I let Game Pass go because all of my unlocks are on Xbox although no it's cross platform with Steam isn't it maybe I don't have to let it go that would be nice

602
00:52:50,101 --> 00:53:06,118
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

603
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:20,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I mean, basically there had been other spinoffs like Splatterhouse, One Paku Graffiti, but this was a Famicom title that was going to do an RPG called Splatterworld.

604
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:23,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was supposed to launch in March of 1993, but was canceled.

605
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:28,755
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was promotional material that had been distributed.

606
00:53:28,976 --> 00:53:34,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Japanese retailers had this information as of 1992, so it was pretty close to being finished.

607
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:36,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we now have a working ROM.

608
00:53:37,268 --> 00:53:44,118
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced by West Mansion and uploaded to 4chan.

609
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:50,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It works in FCEUX, which...

610
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:55,535
[SPEAKER_01]: It works there because of a Namco mapper that they needed.

611
00:53:55,556 --> 00:54:02,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I checked it out, there was a fixed version, a ROM fix on it.

612
00:54:02,927 --> 00:54:04,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are two versions out.

613
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,212
[SPEAKER_01]: This was as of the first.

614
00:54:06,232 --> 00:54:08,515
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to test it out and see if it works.

615
00:54:08,575 --> 00:54:12,201
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can play Splatterworld.

616
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's cool they made an RPG in that universe.

617
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:15,743
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

618
00:54:15,763 --> 00:54:16,465
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of awesome.

619
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:17,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious.

620
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super curious.

621
00:54:18,408 --> 00:54:20,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd play the shit out of that.

622
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:20,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's a retro.

623
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:22,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's what I should play.

624
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:23,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very curious.

625
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:25,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check it out if you do.

626
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

627
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:28,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on.

628
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:29,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

629
00:54:30,732 --> 00:54:31,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

630
00:54:31,453 --> 00:54:32,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

631
00:54:33,764 --> 00:54:35,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about movies.

632
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:40,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We know The Legend of Zelda movie is right around the corner and it is filming.

633
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:44,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have started filming in, I know, New Zealand.

634
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:49,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy that a fantasy movie... That's where all the pretty movies go.

635
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:50,365
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where they all go.

636
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

637
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:58,135
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's started filming and yeah, I don't know... Do we have any...

638
00:54:58,115 --> 00:54:59,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any listeners in New Zealand?

639
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:00,958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

640
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:02,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have any live.

641
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Podcast, do we have anybody in New Zealand that listens to this show?

642
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:07,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And can I come stay at your house?

643
00:55:07,066 --> 00:55:09,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Because New Zealand looks really pretty.

644
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:11,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We're always talking about all these movies.

645
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:13,233
[SPEAKER_11]: This is gorgeous.

646
00:55:13,253 --> 00:55:15,515
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, imagine living there.

647
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:19,680
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember Melon Punk Night, right?

648
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

649
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're moving to New Zealand.

650
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:23,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they really?

651
00:55:24,344 --> 00:55:32,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew they were leaving their house in the place that it is now, not doxing my friends on air, but I did not know it was because they're going to New Zealand.

652
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:34,135
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to New Zealand.

653
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:36,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this like a get the fuck out of America thing?

654
00:55:36,498 --> 00:55:37,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Live in the dream, jealous?

655
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think so.

656
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:45,689
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very punk night thing to do, but hey, hey, I'm speaking from a place of jealousy.

657
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that sounds amazing.

658
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:47,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.

659
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:48,913
[SPEAKER_11]: I have somebody to crash with.

660
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:50,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

661
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:51,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Make some room.

662
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:53,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Uncle Rob's coming.

663
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go see The Hobbit House.

664
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:00,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the Zelda movie is still a ways away.

665
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:02,810
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I think, April 2027.

666
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Grand Theft Auto 6 will be out by then.

667
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is this a new game?

668
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,502
[SPEAKER_11]: What comes out first, Grand Theft Auto 6 or the Zelda movie?

669
00:56:14,845 --> 00:56:15,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Zelda movie.

670
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the Zelda movie, actually.

671
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:20,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know.

672
00:56:20,526 --> 00:56:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to say.

673
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:27,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you interested in this movie that they're doing?

674
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:29,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

675
00:56:29,778 --> 00:56:34,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're trying to figure out what game it's based off of, but we just have too little information.

676
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:40,412
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually kind of hope, like similar to the Mass Effect TV series Jamie brought up earlier, I kind of hope it's actually not tied to a game.

677
00:56:40,953 --> 00:56:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, how would y'all feel if it was like an original story?

678
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:47,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have all of these... It should be based off of the cartoon.

679
00:56:47,982 --> 00:56:48,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

680
00:56:48,022 --> 00:57:16,527
[SPEAKER_11]: excuse me princess I don't although if they slip that line in there somewhere even if it's just something like he utters under his breath you know what's gonna happen you put it in the trailer 40 year olds will lose their fucking minds it's gonna be a fucking chicken jockey moment if we get excuse me princess you know what you need to do I think the line's gonna be there but Link isn't gonna say it

681
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:24,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, like give it to another character, like a shopkeeper or something type of character.

682
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,518
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be interesting.

683
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:31,303
[SPEAKER_08]: They really need to quote as much as they can from the CDI version of the game.

684
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, just put them in there.

685
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:33,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

686
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:34,567
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obscure.

687
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:36,028
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd make me happy, though.

688
00:57:36,088 --> 00:57:36,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Put that in there.

689
00:57:36,869 --> 00:57:38,150
[SPEAKER_08]: And excuse me, Princess, you got it.

690
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:40,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yeah, what was that?

691
00:57:40,813 --> 00:57:41,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so hungry.

692
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:43,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I could eat a, what was it?

693
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:44,938
[SPEAKER_08]: An Octorok or something like that?

694
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

695
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:47,126
[SPEAKER_11]: from the cartoon.

696
00:57:47,767 --> 00:58:01,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually think the line in the trailer that would get the gas from the audience would be the old, like, it should start and it should be like this, you know, going into this very dark cave and it's very dark.

697
00:58:01,142 --> 00:58:05,186
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's this old man who's lit very, very subtly by fire.

698
00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:08,891
[SPEAKER_11]: And he just looks at the camera and says, it's dangerous to go alone.

699
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:09,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Take this.

700
00:58:09,992 --> 00:58:11,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes into the whole thing.

701
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:14,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's the line that would get people to be honest.

702
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,452
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see, we'll see.

703
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:20,719
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is going to be an art thing.

704
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:26,927
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to shitify itself with all these references.

705
00:58:26,967 --> 00:58:30,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not asking you to just do this for the whole movie.

706
00:58:30,873 --> 00:58:36,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Less than 1% of the movie has this kind of crap in it.

707
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

708
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:39,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a silly nod.

709
00:58:39,886 --> 00:58:41,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a wink at the camera.

710
00:58:41,548 --> 00:58:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, a wink at the camera is all we ask.

711
00:58:43,692 --> 00:58:46,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And excuse me, princess, you can get away with it.

712
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:52,164
[SPEAKER_11]: You can fit it into the script and still have your arthouse film that gets Oscar nominations because I bet that's what they're ultimately going for.

713
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:59,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, if the, you know, whatever the D&D movie was, if they could have the animated team show up in it, then, I mean...

714
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,781
[SPEAKER_08]: God, the D&D movie is so good.

715
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:03,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we get a sequel for that soon.

716
00:59:03,504 --> 00:59:04,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sure you will.

717
00:59:04,305 --> 00:59:04,846
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so good.

718
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:06,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so good.

719
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:10,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I'm excited.

720
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:12,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the story could be an original story.

721
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:23,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the internet's focusing way too much on which game are they adapting without realizing that all the games, they all exist in the different parallel parts of the universe and timelines, really.

722
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:24,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all these different timelines, right?

723
00:59:24,956 --> 00:59:28,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the movie should just exist in another timeline.

724
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:50,629
[SPEAKER_11]: that can then maybe subtly tie itself to one of the games at the end or something but I think the movie should just exist in its own timeline because I think to adapt one of the games literally it's never going to be good enough for the internet it's never going to be good enough for the internet and it's not like the Mario movie had to adapt one of the games and it was fine so I would say the Zelda movie does its own fucking thing and it'll be fine

725
00:59:51,706 --> 00:59:52,928
[SPEAKER_11]: but one little wink.

726
00:59:53,148 --> 00:59:53,949
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we ask.

727
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,191
[SPEAKER_11]: One little wink.

728
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,576
[SPEAKER_11]: And then SJ100Matt says, the movie ends with the warp pipe showing up.

729
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and the invitation to the Smash Brothers film.

730
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

731
01:00:01,821 --> 01:00:03,364
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, it's not going to happen.

732
01:00:03,964 --> 01:00:08,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all are, you're putting the asks way up here.

733
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:10,234
[SPEAKER_08]: You're putting the asks way up here.

734
01:00:10,294 --> 01:00:11,816
[SPEAKER_08]: That would just be weird.

735
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:16,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless, yeah, it's just weird.

736
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:18,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless puppets.

737
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:19,688
[SPEAKER_11]: We've talked about this.

738
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:21,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

739
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:29,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this other movie shouldn't have been animated, but... In all reality, though, I really hope that Link is mostly silent.

740
01:00:31,104 --> 01:00:31,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be curious.

741
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,692
[SPEAKER_01]: A man of few words.

742
01:00:34,193 --> 01:00:36,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Because men shouldn't speak.

743
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:40,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

744
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:43,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about Atari 50.

745
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:46,336
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, this game that keeps on giving, in a good way.

746
01:00:46,416 --> 01:01:01,639
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because, you know, obviously we had all these different digital eclipse collections that have spawned off of what Atari 50 sort of laid down, including the recent Mortal Kombat collection, which I heard got a patch this week, so I'm curious to see if it helped with some of the issues, but I've been too busy in hell and Diablo.

747
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:29,483
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com.

748
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:30,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Galaga for $7,800.

749
01:01:31,306 --> 01:01:34,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Galaxian for the $2,600, the $5,200, and the Atari 8-bit.

750
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:37,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man for the $5,200, the $2,600.

751
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:40,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the $2,600 version of Pac-Man being released again.

752
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:42,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Atari 8-bit.

753
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:46,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And Xevious for the $7,800 and the arcade.

754
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the documentary part of this, I'm...

755
01:01:49,544 --> 01:01:54,528
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny, we all shiver or shudder when we think about the 2600 version of Pac-Man.

756
01:01:54,549 --> 01:02:01,154
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, it was a really like what they got away with in that cart size.

757
01:02:01,275 --> 01:02:08,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what I believe I recall the story going, the guy who programmed it asked for an 8K cart size.

758
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:14,186
[SPEAKER_11]: But because that would have made the game more expensive, he got told, no, it has to fit into 4K.

759
01:02:14,827 --> 01:02:19,551
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he had to make the Atari 2600 do fucking party tricks left and right.

760
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:41,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You said it was, was it also Inky and Clyde?

761
01:02:41,249 --> 01:02:44,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what and what surprises me is that it must.

762
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:45,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, they were there.

763
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:47,415
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have the personalities in 2600 version.

764
01:02:47,435 --> 01:02:48,976
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I was joking.

765
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:49,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

766
01:02:49,296 --> 01:02:49,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

767
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,939
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wish they would put this side by side.

768
01:02:51,959 --> 01:02:59,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I guess we have the 5200 version, which wasn't a more proper size card, but I wish they would put Pac-Man for the 2600 side by side with Ms.

769
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:03,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Pac-Man for the 2600 because that did end up in an 8K card.

770
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:05,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And you see that it is a lot more arcade.

771
01:03:06,171 --> 01:03:11,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's still not perfect, but it's a lot more arcade accurate than the original Pac-Man was.

772
01:03:11,236 --> 01:03:31,557
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

773
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:32,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

774
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,524
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

775
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:52,752
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

776
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:55,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, looking in chat, YYR says, this is really cool.

777
01:03:55,937 --> 01:04:02,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite how awful the Atari 2600 Pac-Man was, I kind of want to see the interviews about that legendarily awful game.

778
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:03,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

779
01:04:03,147 --> 01:04:06,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's a very similar deal with E.T.

780
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:19,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And hearing Howard Scott Warshaw, who made, you know, and you all know this is the infamous thing he always talks about, he made the worst 2600 game of all time, E.T., and he made one of the best Atari 2600 games of all time, Yars' Revenge.

781
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:22,215
[SPEAKER_11]: There was other stuff in between there, too, like the Indiana Jones game and stuff.

782
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:37,032
[SPEAKER_11]: so um it's interesting to hear him talk about ET and how that game coming together as fast as it did was a miracle too and probably involved a lot of cocaine but I don't think he talks about that allegedly but I don't think he talks about that part um

783
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:38,465
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's see.

784
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions here or comments in chat?

785
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:42,410
[SPEAKER_11]: S2100 Matt.

786
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:44,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

787
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:48,758
[SPEAKER_11]: S2100 Matt says, if those glass coffee tables during those planning sessions could talk.

788
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:52,222
[SPEAKER_11]: And PodCulture says, more snow than a ski resort.

789
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:53,624
[SPEAKER_11]: You get it.

790
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:54,184
[SPEAKER_11]: You get it.

791
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:54,765
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

792
01:04:55,586 --> 01:04:56,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go on.

793
01:04:57,368 --> 01:05:00,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we're talking about classic games, what a nice segue to our next segment.

794
01:05:10,913 --> 01:05:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

795
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:23,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

796
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:24,359
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be a fun one tonight.

797
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:27,184
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what did you pick tonight for the game of the week?

798
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:46,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Rise of the Triad

799
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:54,127
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a first-person shooter that was developed and published by Apogee Software, now 3D Realms.

800
01:05:54,147 --> 01:06:00,258
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, you can play as one of five different characters, and each of them has their own attributes.

801
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have the fast one, the sneaky one, the enduring one, the strong one, blah, blah.

802
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:15,400
[SPEAKER_01]: and you follow these characters through their story as they have to investigate a cult and then they learn about a plot to destroy the city.

803
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:26,279
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a remake by Interceptor Entertainment and it was released by Apogee in 2013 and then there is a shareware version called Rise of the Triad The Hunt Begins.

804
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:28,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into those in a bit.

805
01:06:27,982 --> 01:06:36,918
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little history is that it started as a follow-up game to Wolfenstein 3D, but was altered and became a standalone.

806
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,184
[SPEAKER_01]: It has single player and multiplayer.

807
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:44,531
[SPEAKER_01]: You can connect with other gamers and tackle missions as a team.

808
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:50,682
[SPEAKER_01]: It is powered by a modified version of the Wolfenstein 3D engine.

809
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:54,716
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was supposed to be called Wolfenstein 3D to the Rise of the Triad.

810
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:00,857
[SPEAKER_01]: That idea was scrapped by id Software and Apogee bought the license.

811
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:11,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway, you have to collect these keys as you go through the level, and you have to do different tactics and solve problems.

812
01:07:12,364 --> 01:07:22,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Your characters have different traits that depend on, you have hit point speed accuracy, etc.

813
01:07:23,669 --> 01:07:50,335
[SPEAKER_01]: in the shareware version you only have one of the characters and he's set for a very average there are enemies that can beg for their life if they take enough damage or fake their death there are enemies that dodge the attack some try to ambush you it's pretty pretty intense and all of the enemies are digitized actors played by Apogee employees and relatives and friends

814
01:07:50,315 --> 01:07:56,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on those occasions, there are a large amount of gibs.

815
01:07:56,683 --> 01:07:58,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Ludicrous gibs!

816
01:07:58,385 --> 01:07:59,005
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you get.

817
01:07:59,126 --> 01:07:59,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Ludicrous gibs.

818
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:06,474
[SPEAKER_01]: As YYR just happened to say in that.

819
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:09,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they're giblets.

820
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:11,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, body parts.

821
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:14,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

822
01:08:15,766 --> 01:08:16,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

823
01:08:19,002 --> 01:08:21,506
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go through, you have 13 different weapons.

824
01:08:21,526 --> 01:08:25,071
[SPEAKER_01]: You have bullet weapons, missile weapons, and magic weapons.

825
01:08:25,091 --> 01:08:26,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go through with all of that.

826
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:29,898
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can only have one power-up active at one time.

827
01:08:29,998 --> 01:08:34,645
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the multiplayer called COM-BAT, C-O-M-M-B-A-T.

828
01:08:35,546 --> 01:08:40,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have up to 11 players simultaneously, each with different uniform colors.

829
01:08:41,815 --> 01:08:45,280
[SPEAKER_01]: But in team mode, you have a single uniform color for each team.

830
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine different multiplayer modes.

831
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Deathmatch.

832
01:08:50,448 --> 01:08:54,635
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a tag mode, kind of like the kids game.

833
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:55,977
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a hunter mode.

834
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:57,900
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the hunter and the prey.

835
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,741
[SPEAKER_01]: There's capture the flag.

836
01:08:58,761 --> 01:08:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few different ones.

837
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:06,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, this started off as a follow-up to Wolfenstein 3D.

838
01:09:09,718 --> 01:09:10,339
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

839
01:09:12,293 --> 01:09:13,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like, okay, we're done.

840
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:17,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Apogee bought what was left there.

841
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:27,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the game, you know, they were going to use that same engine code for Wolfenstein 3D, new levels, art characters.

842
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:37,727
[SPEAKER_01]: But as they were getting further into development, their project leader, Scott Miller, was contacted by John Romero, who...

843
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:40,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell Miller that the project had been canceled.

844
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:45,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was... It didn't want to take anything away from Doom.

845
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:50,329
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it went over and Apogee got it.

846
01:09:50,349 --> 01:09:52,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just removed all the Nazi stuff.

847
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:56,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

848
01:09:56,978 --> 01:10:00,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, there's a lot more about that.

849
01:10:00,706 --> 01:10:03,151
[SPEAKER_01]: But there also is some cut content.

850
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:07,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the enemies had female versions.

851
01:10:09,484 --> 01:10:17,400
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was going to load both sets of guards into the memory and then randomly determine what you get.

852
01:10:17,752 --> 01:10:24,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really made the memory requirements much higher, so they removed the alternates.

853
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:28,702
[SPEAKER_01]: There are stills, though, that you can see of actors cut from the game.

854
01:10:30,344 --> 01:10:33,907
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other levels, like the Rot Reject level pack.

855
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:43,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the stages that were cut from the game, and you can get that level pack to play them, and different artwork that you can find on the CD.

856
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:51,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, the game was distributed as shareware, so the first episode was for free.

857
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:53,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

858
01:10:54,944 --> 01:10:56,987
[SPEAKER_01]: It had 10 original levels.

859
01:10:57,027 --> 01:10:59,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Rise of the Triad, The Hunt Begins.

860
01:10:59,972 --> 01:11:01,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, there was those limitations.

861
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:06,082
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, you could only play as one character, and there were only four of the multiplayer modes.

862
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:18,201
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the deluxe of the shareware, which was retailed by LaserSoft, and it had three extra levels and three extra multiplayer that you could only play on their version.

863
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:24,308
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there were different versions of the full game too with three new episodes.

864
01:11:24,749 --> 01:11:30,599
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a floppy disk and a CD version that both had the 32 game levels and the three new episodes.

865
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,666
[SPEAKER_01]: The CD version had more multiplayer levels.

866
01:11:34,686 --> 01:11:41,758
[SPEAKER_01]: The site license version had several multiplayer levels and you could play up to 11 different computers on a network.

867
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:45,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I have played this in this mode a while back.

868
01:11:46,575 --> 01:11:47,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago.

869
01:11:48,917 --> 01:12:00,128
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, Rise of the Triad was released on GOG.com through DOSBox, and so it can be played on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

870
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:05,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's playable on the current macOS.

871
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:07,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that's Intel-based.

872
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:17,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, Apogee released a reject level pack that was a lot of the cut ones, things that were unsuitable for the release.

873
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: This was released on July 25th, 1995.

874
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:30,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could also play as Dopefish, who, that's my friend.

875
01:12:31,382 --> 01:12:31,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

876
01:12:34,165 --> 01:12:37,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate,

877
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, if you're listening, hi.

878
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:56,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there was an official retail of the level pack that was released by Apogee for the ROTT called Extreme Rise of the Triad, also in 1995.

879
01:12:58,486 --> 01:13:07,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the add-on was produced by a couple of people in the series.

880
01:13:07,068 --> 01:13:08,391
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is my friend Joe.

881
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:08,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Joe.

882
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:11,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other was Tom Hall.

883
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:18,832
[SPEAKER_01]: But the maps that were produced in this are harder than the original ones.

884
01:13:18,932 --> 01:13:22,038
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some definitely tricks that were involved in making it.

885
01:13:22,419 --> 01:13:25,104
[SPEAKER_01]: These levels were released as freeware September 1st, 2000.

886
01:13:25,685 --> 01:13:36,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest of the remaining stuff was put out as freeware as ROTT Goodies Pack on February 15th, 2005.

887
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:44,035
[SPEAKER_01]: um so there are other level packs um there was the laser soft deluxe shareware maps um

888
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:51,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Apogee re-released those themselves after Lasersoft went out of business.

889
01:13:52,418 --> 01:14:03,796
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another level called Wolf 3D that was meant to see if the geography from Wolfenstein 3D could be replicated in Rise of the Triad, since it used the same engine.

890
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,221
[SPEAKER_01]: There are...

891
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:19,270
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the Ohio RTC pack that was a four level multiplayer pack that was designed for group in Ohio holding a game tourney called Bloodfest 96 um

892
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:23,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one was called You and Spray.

893
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:30,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a gag, 1998, to play at the level editor.

894
01:14:31,354 --> 01:14:32,696
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was released in November 2000.

895
01:14:32,896 --> 01:14:43,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So the source code for Rise of the Triad was released under the GNU GPL 2.0 or later on December 20th, 2002.

896
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:55,392
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it had been ported by fans to Amiga OS, Linux, Mac OS, Xbox, Dreamcast, PSP and Nintendo DS Homebrew and 32-bit Windows.

897
01:14:56,274 --> 01:15:03,887
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was included in the Fedora software repository so it was a free port.

898
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:06,222
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the remaster.

899
01:15:06,242 --> 01:15:12,433
[SPEAKER_01]: 3D Realms did Realms Deep 2020 livestream and showed the game playing on a Switch.

900
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:17,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would also play on Windows, Switch, PS4, Xbox for 2021 release.

901
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:24,255
[SPEAKER_01]: At Realms Deep 2022, it was re-announced as Rise of the Triad, the Ludicrous Edition.

902
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:37,631
[SPEAKER_01]: And the demo came out actually on June 19th, 2023 and was released on July 31st, 2023 and September 23rd, 2023 for consoles.

903
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:40,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was for the 10th anniversary of the 2013 remake.

904
01:15:42,616 --> 01:15:51,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the game is... A lot of people really consider this to be one of...

905
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: The games of its era.

906
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone was super into it.

907
01:16:01,363 --> 01:16:04,547
[SPEAKER_01]: The iOS version was really not well received at all.

908
01:16:04,788 --> 01:16:06,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It got mediocre reviews.

909
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:15,863
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the full version, DOS Spirit, Honest Gamers, PC Team, a lot of them were giving it... Next Generation gave it a 3 out of 5.

910
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:21,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of folks just were really into it.

911
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:43,737
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there as I mentioned there was a 2013 remake and that one was revealed at QuakeCon 2012 developed by sorry designed by Frederick Schreiber by Interceptor Entertainment and came out July 31st 2013 through Steam and GOG and that's it all right

912
01:16:44,999 --> 01:16:46,461
[SPEAKER_11]: One that I think I played briefly.

913
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I played the shareware version of this briefly, but never really played the full thing.

914
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:55,835
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, just kind of watching this YouTube, I go, oh, this is definitely a throwback to that era of first-person shooters.

915
01:16:56,156 --> 01:16:59,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Rise of the Triad, game of the week.

916
01:16:59,441 --> 01:16:59,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Fun pick.

917
01:16:59,802 --> 01:17:00,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, yep.

918
01:17:00,943 --> 01:17:01,364
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

919
01:17:02,105 --> 01:17:03,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have to tell Joe I gave him a shout out.

920
01:17:04,949 --> 01:17:05,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

921
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:06,231
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

922
01:17:06,311 --> 01:17:10,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we have just a few quick headlines here before we get into some release dates and the listener roundtable.

923
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:12,561
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get to some fast headlines.

924
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:13,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Rapid Fire News, The Loki.

925
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:20,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man, it's like it's it's time just continues to repeat itself.

926
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:21,546
[SPEAKER_08]: But here we go.

927
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:22,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Year 2025.

928
01:17:22,628 --> 01:17:34,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the holiday season and Soulja Boy is out there just grinding and grinding by taking an existing product, claiming that honest question name on it.

929
01:17:34,748 --> 01:17:35,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Honest question.

930
01:17:35,349 --> 01:17:37,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Soulja Boy still relevant?

931
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:38,705
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to sound shady.

932
01:17:38,726 --> 01:17:40,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just asking an honest question.

933
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Soulja Boy still relevant?

934
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

935
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:45,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

936
01:17:45,847 --> 01:17:49,920
[SPEAKER_11]: The comparison I was going to make was extremely unfair, so I'm just going to let it move on.

937
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:59,926
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, he is attempting to take an existing device, a device that I actually own, by the way.

938
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:07,401
[SPEAKER_08]: He's taking a device to the, was it the Retroid Pocket Flip 2?

939
01:18:07,642 --> 01:18:08,223
[SPEAKER_08]: This one right here.

940
01:18:09,325 --> 01:18:11,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically...

941
01:18:11,129 --> 01:18:27,450
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

942
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:30,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Vint got called out.

943
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:36,773
[SPEAKER_08]: The Retroid team, the actual company developers, like, we did not authorize this.

944
01:18:37,815 --> 01:18:39,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know about this.

945
01:18:39,878 --> 01:18:42,302
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not any kind of official licensee deal.

946
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:46,348
[SPEAKER_08]: He does not have permission to rebrand our product and sell them as his own.

947
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:49,813
[SPEAKER_08]: The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S.

948
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,035
[SPEAKER_08]: by ourselves.

949
01:18:51,796 --> 01:18:53,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you cannot do that.

950
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:54,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

951
01:18:55,932 --> 01:18:58,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now he's marked them down.

952
01:18:58,296 --> 01:19:03,425
[SPEAKER_08]: They're now $200 on his site.

953
01:19:03,445 --> 01:19:04,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

954
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,689
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not going to be good enough.

955
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:07,913
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to nail him.

956
01:19:09,897 --> 01:19:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ridiculous.

957
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you just can't...

958
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:15,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Is his brain just broken?

959
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:18,060
[SPEAKER_08]: What is wrong with these people?

960
01:19:19,162 --> 01:19:19,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

961
01:19:19,744 --> 01:19:23,592
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually probably not that.

962
01:19:23,612 --> 01:19:34,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I find that typically, just in my limited experience with celebrities, but I've met a few over time, and more importantly, I've met the people they surround themselves with, that

963
01:19:35,572 --> 01:19:42,900
[SPEAKER_11]: really gas these people up one way, and then to the people around them, or the people that work with them, another way.

964
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,482
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always this intermediary.

965
01:19:46,103 --> 01:19:51,108
[SPEAKER_11]: I would actually expect he knows very little about what's going on.

966
01:19:51,148 --> 01:19:52,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it seems like that.

967
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sticking to it.

968
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:57,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when he was showing off the console, he's like, look, see, it's got TikTok on it.

969
01:19:57,315 --> 01:19:59,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, because it's an Android device.

970
01:19:59,297 --> 01:20:00,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course it has TikTok on it.

971
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:03,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

972
01:20:03,782 --> 01:20:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this...

973
01:20:05,288 --> 01:20:09,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... Who's making their purchasing decisions based off of Soulja Boy?

974
01:20:10,114 --> 01:20:11,576
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question, too.

975
01:20:11,616 --> 01:20:18,904
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are making your purchasing decisions off of Soulja Boy, you gotta really look in and reflect on yourself and see where you've gone wrong.

976
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:22,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you are in dire need of help.

977
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:25,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps reach out to family and friends.

978
01:20:25,252 --> 01:20:26,994
[SPEAKER_08]: You have lost your way.

979
01:20:27,855 --> 01:20:29,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Soulja Boy, you got issues.

980
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:31,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

981
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:31,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

982
01:20:33,301 --> 01:20:35,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, can we get him to go on Shark Tank?

983
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:36,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I want to see him pitch this on Shark Tank.

984
01:20:38,828 --> 01:20:40,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for the lulz.

985
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:41,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Next story.

986
01:20:42,693 --> 01:20:47,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, next thing, a little bit more interesting, is Overcooked.

987
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:57,131
[SPEAKER_08]: The crazy cooking game is now being adapted by A24 into perhaps a TV or movie.

988
01:20:58,072 --> 01:20:58,713
[SPEAKER_08]: TV series.

989
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be...

990
01:21:01,027 --> 01:21:20,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how that would necessarily translate into like a cooking show, but Well, it's just going to be another knockoff of Hell's Kitchen It's just going to be people, instead of a chef screaming at people like Hell's Kitchen, it'll be them screaming at each other Hell's Kitchen and Wipeout together, you know, as one giant thing

991
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:24,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Overcooked is one of those games that ends friendships like Mario Party.

992
01:21:25,024 --> 01:21:26,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I refuse to play it.

993
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a perfectly acceptable stance to take, quite honestly.

994
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:34,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played it, but it's, you know, people get very intense in that game.

995
01:21:35,379 --> 01:21:37,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it really depends on who you play it with.

996
01:21:38,965 --> 01:21:42,730
[SPEAKER_11]: If everybody's high and doesn't care, it's fine.

997
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:45,394
[SPEAKER_11]: If everybody's drunk and aggressive, not good.

998
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:47,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Not good.

999
01:21:47,117 --> 01:21:47,217
Yeah.

1000
01:21:48,698 --> 01:21:50,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, we'll see what happens with this.

1001
01:21:51,608 --> 01:21:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, they're looking at doing something with TV and movies with it.

1002
01:21:56,264 --> 01:21:56,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1003
01:21:57,305 --> 01:21:58,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, I guess.

1004
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:02,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, Deft in chat says A24 is behind it, though.

1005
01:22:02,992 --> 01:22:04,013
[SPEAKER_11]: My stamp of approval.

1006
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:05,374
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fair point.

1007
01:22:05,394 --> 01:22:06,235
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fair point.

1008
01:22:06,275 --> 01:22:08,338
[SPEAKER_11]: A24 does a lot of cool stuff.

1009
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:13,303
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S says, I think Gordon Ramsay was connected to Overcooked for a bit.

1010
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:14,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

1011
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:19,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what it is, is that Overcooked was inspired by like Gordon Ramsay cooking shows and stuff.

1012
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:23,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's it's you have this weird copy of a copy thing going on.

1013
01:22:23,495 --> 01:22:39,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I still can't believe Hell's Kitchen is a show they're making.

1014
01:22:39,627 --> 01:22:41,570
[SPEAKER_11]: How many seasons of that show has there been?

1015
01:22:41,971 --> 01:22:43,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1016
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:47,360
[SPEAKER_01]: As many as Gordon Ramsay wants to make money off of.

1017
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:51,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of Hell's Kitchen, but I don't... See, here's the thing.

1018
01:22:51,908 --> 01:22:54,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of competition shows like that.

1019
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:57,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't like them playing up the drama.

1020
01:22:57,657 --> 01:23:00,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want a strict, like, hey, here's the teams...

1021
01:23:01,683 --> 01:23:04,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool if we get to know them a little bit, you know, that's fine.

1022
01:23:04,372 --> 01:23:08,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, I don't want all the, like, oh, all the drama.

1023
01:23:08,144 --> 01:23:09,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want, like...

1024
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:11,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Just an actual competition show.

1025
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:15,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Treat it like the Japanese version of Iron Chef.

1026
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:18,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, I love the drama when it's Iron Chef drama.

1027
01:23:19,726 --> 01:23:21,929
[SPEAKER_11]: When it's like the theatrics.

1028
01:23:22,089 --> 01:23:22,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I think is a better way to put it.

1029
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:24,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the theatrics.

1030
01:23:24,152 --> 01:23:25,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I love theatrics.

1031
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:25,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1032
01:23:25,715 --> 01:23:26,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.

1033
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:32,244
[SPEAKER_08]: But just, can we have the theatrics and not the like... Which is why I miss American Gladiators.

1034
01:23:32,364 --> 01:23:33,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss American Gladiators for the same thing.

1035
01:23:33,987 --> 01:23:37,392
[SPEAKER_11]: The theatrics of that show was ridiculous.

1036
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:37,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1037
01:23:37,492 --> 01:24:04,967
[SPEAKER_11]: MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef, MasterChef

1038
01:24:04,947 --> 01:24:06,348
[SPEAKER_11]: MasterChef Kids.

1039
01:24:06,669 --> 01:24:13,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, completely different Gordon Ramsay because Gordon Ramsay is a very good actor.

1040
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:17,800
[SPEAKER_11]: And when he's doing Hell's Kitchen, he plays a part.

1041
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:23,426
[SPEAKER_11]: When he's doing MasterChef, he's probably a little bit more of his authentic self.

1042
01:24:23,446 --> 01:24:26,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Or it's side A and side B. He's playing a different part.

1043
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:31,815
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to think that MasterChef Junior is a little bit more of his authentic self than...

1044
01:24:31,795 --> 01:24:43,634
[SPEAKER_10]: The character he plays on Hell's Kitchen I mean, it could be vice versa, but I doubt it Twice as critical, twice as explicit You want to see one where the kids are put through hell, don't you?

1045
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:57,516
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all crying, he's like, I'm not leaving this set until you're all in tears And they're regretting the choices they've made in their short lives The wrong Gordon Ramsay showed up today Alright DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1046
01:24:58,576 --> 01:25:18,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had hinted at this earlier, but BioWare is insisting that there is still a new Mass Effect in development, that they are trying to make sure it fits into the Mass Effect canon, and it still would be itself a new game.

1047
01:25:19,936 --> 01:25:28,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are very clear in saying that it's not, quote, a retread of Commander Shepard's story.

1048
01:25:30,014 --> 01:25:32,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's all that crap going on with EA.

1049
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:44,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a little bit more going on because they announced that partnership with Stability AI for AI-powered tools for development.

1050
01:25:44,421 --> 01:25:47,126
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they're tools and not generative, that's what I say.

1051
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:50,672
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean...

1052
01:25:50,652 --> 01:25:51,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait and see.

1053
01:25:51,794 --> 01:25:52,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy it.

1054
01:25:53,037 --> 01:25:55,843
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mass Effect, and I'm a Mass Effect whore.

1055
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:57,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And how.

1056
01:25:58,789 --> 01:25:59,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1057
01:25:59,691 --> 01:26:01,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cool.

1058
01:26:02,697 --> 01:26:05,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Garrus is currently calibrating and how.

1059
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:05,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1060
01:26:05,836 --> 01:26:07,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how to match what I'm saying.

1061
01:26:07,839 --> 01:26:08,279
[SPEAKER_11]: He's calibrating.

1062
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:09,641
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1063
01:26:09,661 --> 01:26:10,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about this.

1064
01:26:10,362 --> 01:26:16,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Jason references the intro tonight and he's talking a little bit about what's going on in World of Warcraft.

1065
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:19,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, World of Warcraft is making a new expansion, which does sound pretty cool.

1066
01:26:19,977 --> 01:26:21,099
[SPEAKER_11]: The new Midnight expansion.

1067
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:24,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, housing is finally coming to WoW, which a lot of people are excited about.

1068
01:26:24,924 --> 01:26:28,810
[SPEAKER_11]: But uh-oh, we just found out about Hearthsteel.

1069
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:29,591
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

1070
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:30,913
[SPEAKER_11]: A new currency.

1071
01:26:31,013 --> 01:26:32,155
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of currency?

1072
01:26:32,255 --> 01:26:33,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Premium currency.

1073
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:34,699
[SPEAKER_11]: For fuck's sake.

1074
01:26:34,679 --> 01:27:01,092
[SPEAKER_11]: and Blizzard is saying that this new currency is supposed to be allowing you to do multiple items at once and offering this is my favorite part offering financial protections for folks involved you may want a full set of chairs to place around a dining table multiple place settings for your invited guests many candles using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient

1075
01:27:01,072 --> 01:27:15,283
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can buy Hearthsteel with your Battle.net balance or of course in-game gold via WoW tokens because there's that whole thing where there already is the gold that you can turn into real money which has existed in Warcraft for some time.

1076
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:20,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so this was found from data miners.

1077
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:23,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard did confirm it, and people on Reddit are losing their minds.

1078
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:24,489
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see.

1079
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:41,777
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, and what has people concerned, and I get it, is that this is all being discovered weeks after we heard the story about Microsoft is pressuring all of their gaming companies, which Blizzard is one of now, to make sure you've got 30% profit margins.

1080
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:45,710
[SPEAKER_11]: They're called accountability margins at Microsoft now.

1081
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:46,572
[SPEAKER_11]: What a lovely name.

1082
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:48,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, something to think about.

1083
01:27:48,918 --> 01:27:59,884
[SPEAKER_11]: I should point out though, World of Warcraft is still a premium MMO, meaning it is one of like three, I think, left on the market that actually charge a monthly fee.

1084
01:27:59,864 --> 01:28:22,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1085
01:28:23,118 --> 01:28:24,780
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1086
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:30,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth dream in chat says... I don't really have much of a desire to go back and play it again, although I do kind of sometimes miss playing.

1087
01:28:31,127 --> 01:28:31,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1088
01:28:31,427 --> 01:28:32,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of like, I probably will.

1089
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:33,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be honest.

1090
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:37,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably will check out the new expansion just because I enjoyed my time with this most recent one.

1091
01:28:37,954 --> 01:28:42,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't stay subbed, but I subbed for two or three months to finish the expansion, and it was fine.

1092
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the Dells.

1093
01:28:44,141 --> 01:28:46,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious to see how they expand on that in the next expansion.

1094
01:28:47,805 --> 01:28:52,230
[SPEAKER_11]: The housing thing, I don't get as into it as other people do.

1095
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:55,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a house in Final Fantasy XIV.

1096
01:28:56,924 --> 01:29:01,337
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't really have a theme to it, so it is what it is.

1097
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:03,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have any desire to go back to that either.

1098
01:29:03,945 --> 01:29:04,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like...

1099
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:06,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1100
01:29:06,882 --> 01:29:07,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing Palia.

1101
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:34,519
[SPEAKER_11]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat is dropping the meme about Final Fantasy XIV with the free trial level 60 which is also just a really extended demo for that game but I will say in that game's case like the fact you get to it's Stormblood by Bobby you gotta update your meme it's not just Heavensward it's Stormblood now and up to level 70 but I would say that journey especially through Heavensward like Heavensward was probably my I don't know if it's my favorite but it's up there

1102
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:45,640

[SPEAKER_11]: Busy, busy.

1157
01:36:27,734 --> 01:36:30,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that takes us to the listener roundtable.

1158
01:36:30,637 --> 01:36:38,764
[SPEAKER_11]: It's your part of the show for you to send us comments, questions, if you want to pop anything in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, you're more than welcome to.

1159
01:36:38,824 --> 01:36:42,788
[SPEAKER_11]: We also, I know we have a couple emails tonight, we'll get to those in a moment, and we'll get to some phone calls.

1160
01:36:42,828 --> 01:36:44,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I see at least one call in the green room.

1161
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:56,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I will just kind of, you know, remind folks, I think y'all already know, but we only have a couple episodes left after tonight, and the way things are shaping up, next week will be a pretty normal episode, but that will be, we will

1162
01:36:56,641 --> 01:37:03,149
[SPEAKER_11]: We will end the normalcy on the nice number of 1,069, which I think is a great number to go out on.

1163
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:07,775
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will have one more, OLR the Final, on November 23rd.

1164
01:37:07,835 --> 01:37:11,159
[SPEAKER_11]: The format of that show is going to look a little different.

1165
01:37:11,339 --> 01:37:17,046
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll still talk about games, of course, but it's going to be a lot more self-referential, so we look back on 23 years plus of the show.

1166
01:37:17,026 --> 01:37:26,977
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have ideas, things you'd like to see us do, I really invite you to join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord with anything you'd like to see us do for that final show within reason.

1167
01:37:27,478 --> 01:37:28,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Get Reggie Fils-Aimé.

1168
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,321
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be things that are in reason.

1169
01:37:31,182 --> 01:37:32,143
[SPEAKER_11]: But we look forward to that.

1170
01:37:33,565 --> 01:37:34,626
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, I don't know.

1171
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:40,513
[SPEAKER_11]: You're probably not ready to talk about the successor yet, but maybe in a couple weeks you'll have some more information on that.

1172
01:37:41,354 --> 01:37:44,738
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on a teaser.

1173
01:37:44,887 --> 01:37:45,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

1174
01:37:46,209 --> 01:37:47,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've settled on the name.

1175
01:37:48,111 --> 01:37:49,152
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting everything together.

1176
01:37:49,272 --> 01:37:50,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Even I don't know what that is.

1177
01:37:51,135 --> 01:37:51,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1178
01:37:51,775 --> 01:38:11,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally need a little... I need some buffer time because this is... I'm not going to go too far into it, but it's very triggering for my... There's a condition called alexithymia where you feel so many things that you don't know what you're feeling.

1179
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:11,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1180
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:11,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1181
01:38:12,832 --> 01:38:14,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I hear you.

1182
01:38:14,815 --> 01:38:25,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take the rest of the year off before I even think about video creation or whatever I might want to do that's a different sort of time commitment in the future.

1183
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:29,415
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, I think from this year, I'm just so exhausted.

1184
01:38:29,475 --> 01:38:30,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just like, I'm going to take the rest of the year off.

1185
01:38:31,157 --> 01:38:31,958
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm at.

1186
01:38:31,978 --> 01:38:35,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't blame you if you wait a few weeks or whatever you're going to do.

1187
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:38,768
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm excited to hear more about it.

1188
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:39,769
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1189
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:41,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hanging out on Thursday.

1190
01:38:42,565 --> 01:38:44,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everyone, be jealous.

1191
01:38:44,287 --> 01:38:45,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see Clue.

1192
01:38:45,909 --> 01:38:46,209
[SPEAKER_11]: We are.

1193
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:48,271
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go see Clue on the big screen on Thursday.

1194
01:38:48,772 --> 01:38:52,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Randomly, the Crest Theater here started showing, like, oh, they were doing, like, Labyrinth last week.

1195
01:38:52,936 --> 01:38:54,478
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed cool old movies.

1196
01:38:54,498 --> 01:38:56,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at ballet class, so I couldn't go to that one.

1197
01:38:57,101 --> 01:39:00,845
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did Adam's Family Values, I think.

1198
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:01,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1199
01:39:01,025 --> 01:39:04,449
[SPEAKER_01]: But... But... But, yeah.

1200
01:39:05,029 --> 01:39:05,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

1201
01:39:07,895 --> 01:39:10,539
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little talk about the alexithymia.

1202
01:39:10,659 --> 01:39:14,083
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's a comorbid with autism, so it's just a normal thing for me.

1203
01:39:14,744 --> 01:39:17,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, flames!

1204
01:39:17,187 --> 01:39:19,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Flames on the side of my face.

1205
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:23,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me get to some of these calls real quick, because we actually have a couple people in the green room.

1206
01:39:23,516 --> 01:39:25,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to get to them, so we will bring some folks on.

1207
01:39:26,259 --> 01:39:26,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

1208
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1209
01:39:28,542 --> 01:39:28,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1210
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:34,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1211
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,153
[SPEAKER_05]: You called on me first?

1212
01:39:36,173 --> 01:39:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, is that okay?

1213
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:41,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I mean, it's fine, but I think there was someone else in the green room.

1214
01:39:41,584 --> 01:39:49,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I just looked and I saw both you and I pulled... Well, you both get your turn, so what's up?

1215
01:39:49,774 --> 01:39:54,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I called in because... Oh, first of all, hi, it's Aaron.

1216
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:54,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

1217
01:39:56,922 --> 01:39:57,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Flynn.

1218
01:39:58,323 --> 01:39:58,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1219
01:40:00,105 --> 01:40:00,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, LR.

1220
01:40:03,509 --> 01:40:06,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually thinking of emailing just to say hello, LR.

1221
01:40:07,328 --> 01:40:17,305
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1222
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:46,178
[SPEAKER_05]: AJ called in asking about DDR tournaments and I figured I would go ahead and let you know that DDR tournaments are still a thing that is happening quite regularly in fact and I myself against my better judgment have decided to jump in and enter one yeah this coming February in Pennsylvania and

1223
01:40:46,613 --> 01:40:55,459
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, looking forward to it and I wanted to go ahead and let you know what a modern DDR tournament looks like.

1224
01:40:57,397 --> 01:40:58,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please.

1225
01:40:58,058 --> 01:41:03,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my cameras are all messed up and I don't know why, but we're going to adjust that on the fly while you tell us about tournaments.

1226
01:41:03,983 --> 01:41:09,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Because yes, I can't believe I didn't think to talk about that tournaments are still a thing.

1227
01:41:10,409 --> 01:41:12,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I judged one a few years ago.

1228
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,531
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't that long ago I judged one.

1229
01:41:13,551 --> 01:41:16,294
[SPEAKER_11]: It was called Freestyle Takeover or something like that.

1230
01:41:16,374 --> 01:41:19,717
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know they were setting it up to keep it going, but I don't know.

1231
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:22,740
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was trying to look up the current status of that here on the West Coast.

1232
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,321
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, they're still going.

1233
01:41:24,341 --> 01:41:26,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So tell us about what's going on in your part of the country.

1234
01:41:27,434 --> 01:41:35,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so actually this is a pretty common format that a lot of the larger tournaments are using.

1235
01:41:35,688 --> 01:41:43,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, you don't see much in the way of freestyle tournaments anymore, but what you do see is this sort of format that this is.

1236
01:41:43,322 --> 01:41:49,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obviously accuracy-based, of course, but...

1237
01:41:49,793 --> 01:42:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: They've solved a lot of the issues of the past, like, you know, a whole bunch of people entering, you play a match and then you have to wait like six hours or until the next day for your next match.

1238
01:42:03,732 --> 01:42:09,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, possibly getting destroyed in one match and you're done.

1239
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:19,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, a lot of these issues have been fixed by the current format, which is referred to as Waterfall Gauntlet.

1240
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:27,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also seen Waterfall Round Robin, but this Waterfall format is pretty popular.

1241
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:40,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what that is, like if you were to play classic Mortal Kombat, you know how when you start the game it shows, okay, here's the battle plan, and it shows you the ladder that you have to climb up.

1242
01:42:40,861 --> 01:42:46,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically think of that ladder as a series of player pools.

1243
01:42:47,033 --> 01:42:54,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on your performance in the qualifier, which actually happens in the months leading up to the tournament.

1244
01:42:54,965 --> 01:42:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And you basically play the qualifier whenever you want.

1245
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You can submit as many tries as you want.

1246
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:07,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically your best score on a number of songs that you submit screenshots of.

1247
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:16,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And then depending on your rank in the qualifier, you're seeded into a pool somewhere on some rung of this ladder.

1248
01:43:16,177 --> 01:43:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the way it works is the bottom pool is and all the pools are like four to six players so the bottom pool runs first and generally either you have a round robin format where everyone plays against everyone else and you see who gets the most wins

1249
01:43:35,701 --> 01:44:05,168
[SPEAKER_05]: or you have a gauntlet format which is what I'm doing where everyone plays the same set of five songs in my case and highest EX score is what you're competing for and then the top two players I keep forgetting EX score is like a standard now I keep forgetting that that kind of switched a few years ago it makes a much bigger difference now because the skill level of the players is so much higher

1250
01:44:05,148 --> 01:44:09,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You want there to be a bigger difference in score between Marvelous and Perfect.

1251
01:44:10,535 --> 01:44:15,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what you get with EX score, with Marvelous being worth 3 and Perfect worth 2.

1252
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:24,535
[SPEAKER_05]: As opposed to the regular scoring system where Marv and Perfect are basically the same and then Grade is far lower.

1253
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:25,977
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, yes.

1254
01:44:25,997 --> 01:44:28,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally what you have is...

1255
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:36,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You compete with the players in your pool and the top two move on to the next pool and everyone else is out.

1256
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:42,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, basically you can fight your way up so long as you keep

1257
01:44:43,117 --> 01:45:08,770
[SPEAKER_05]: you know dominating your pool and then you're eliminated but what's nice about this format is you play your matches and then you you know if you do well you continue playing and then you're not waiting around until the next day or five hours or whatever for your next matches if you're you know if you keep going you play imminently you're when you're out you're out

1258
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:26,387
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

1259
01:45:26,367 --> 01:45:46,941
[SPEAKER_05]: and if you're seated you know maybe not where you should have been in the qualifier you have the opportunity to move up the ladder which I mean it's exciting to watch and to do of course so yeah it's something I'm very much looking forward to I haven't competed in a DDR tournament in

1260
01:45:46,921 --> 01:46:12,152
[SPEAKER_05]: You go show them kids.

1261
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:14,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

1262
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:15,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to show them something.

1263
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be something laughable, but it will be something indeed.

1264
01:46:20,963 --> 01:46:24,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am planning to do the birthday challenge again.

1265
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:32,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're really bored, I'm not doing it next weekend because I'm going to be traveling, but probably the weekend after that.

1266
01:46:32,163 --> 01:46:51,015
[SPEAKER_05]: if you want to see me play Max 346 times I'll be there it probably is going to be earlier in the day perhaps the same day as the final episode of this show so yeah have fun if you want to watch that

1267
01:46:51,282 --> 01:46:55,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, YYR, thank you, of course, for calling in.

1268
01:46:55,515 --> 01:46:57,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to let you go so we get to, as you know, somebody else is waiting.

1269
01:46:57,802 --> 01:47:02,777
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a couple emails as well, but anything else you want to let off before you go?

1270
01:47:03,905 --> 01:47:10,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry that I couldn't get the new version of Bungie Ferret Tossing ready in time for this.

1271
01:47:10,733 --> 01:47:11,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't apologize for that.

1272
01:47:11,995 --> 01:47:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Focus on that.

1273
01:47:13,617 --> 01:47:15,139
[SPEAKER_11]: It is what it is.

1274
01:47:15,399 --> 01:47:17,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, remember, we're not dying.

1275
01:47:17,762 --> 01:47:18,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I will still be.

1276
01:47:18,543 --> 01:47:23,449
[SPEAKER_11]: If you decide to re-release Bungie Ferret Tossing at some point, I'll still love to play it and hype it where I can.

1277
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:27,674
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be another avenue.

1278
01:47:27,694 --> 01:47:28,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1279
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:30,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

1280
01:47:30,472 --> 01:47:32,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will be in touch.

1281
01:47:33,255 --> 01:47:40,243
[SPEAKER_05]: This will probably be my last call-in, so thank you again for the show, and be well.

1282
01:47:40,283 --> 01:47:40,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.

1283
01:47:40,844 --> 01:47:41,404
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

1284
01:47:41,464 --> 01:47:42,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you once again.

1285
01:47:42,185 --> 01:47:45,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we got into this last time, but thanks so much for all your support over the years.

1286
01:47:45,089 --> 01:47:45,990
[SPEAKER_11]: It really does mean the world.

1287
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:48,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the thing.

1288
01:47:48,573 --> 01:47:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1289
01:47:48,993 --> 01:47:49,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, YYR.

1290
01:47:50,054 --> 01:47:50,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Until next time.

1291
01:47:50,735 --> 01:47:51,296
[SPEAKER_11]: See you later.

1292
01:47:51,496 --> 01:47:51,696
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1293
01:47:51,776 --> 01:47:52,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1294
01:47:52,798 --> 01:47:53,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

1295
01:47:53,578 --> 01:47:54,019
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1296
01:47:54,039 --> 01:47:56,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get Rama in here.

1297
01:47:56,902 --> 01:47:57,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1298
01:48:00,082 --> 01:48:01,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, hi, hi.

1299
01:48:02,008 --> 01:48:03,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up?

1300
01:48:06,261 --> 01:48:10,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I had two things I wanted to say, but now I have three things.

1301
01:48:10,313 --> 01:48:11,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to thank YYR for that.

1302
01:48:12,059 --> 01:48:12,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1303
01:48:13,323 --> 01:48:13,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

1304
01:48:14,307 --> 01:48:24,007
[SPEAKER_09]: No, when you talk about the DDR tournaments, I can more or less vouch for that because as I mentioned before, I have also a friend named Matt.

1305
01:48:24,087 --> 01:48:30,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I come to the realization almost every person I know named Matt has a DDR machine in their house, you know?

1306
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,683
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1307
01:48:31,703 --> 01:48:31,843
Mm-hmm.

1308
01:48:32,093 --> 01:48:46,570
[SPEAKER_09]: and I went over to his house you know he's having his party and him and his girl were talking about DDR in tournaments and I'm asking them what they're doing and they're like they have to submit their scores online to compete and I'm just like scratching my head that's a thing now?

1309
01:48:47,311 --> 01:49:01,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go into details about it but when I'm hearing YYR talk about that I'm like yeah that make it's like the light switch went on you know yeah yeah and you said you had a friend that was at a tournament today

1310
01:49:01,591 --> 01:49:02,333
[SPEAKER_09]: This weekend, yeah.

1311
01:49:02,353 --> 01:49:05,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And he just had another one like a couple of weekends ago, too.

1312
01:49:06,162 --> 01:49:10,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it makes you feel any better, it's within our age range.

1313
01:49:11,154 --> 01:49:16,968
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's just say, oh, he can play.

1314
01:49:16,988 --> 01:49:17,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1315
01:49:17,589 --> 01:49:18,351
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1316
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:23,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you mentioned Food Network earlier.

1317
01:49:23,887 --> 01:49:44,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Then don't I. I'm on the bus coming home, and I just had to internally laugh because I'm at that age where we go to the conventions, we get into the room, after we've done our day thing or whatever, normally we would just hook up the fire stick, have some YouTube playing, chill drinks on the side.

1318
01:49:45,558 --> 01:49:47,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we come into the room,

1319
01:49:48,487 --> 01:49:55,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn on Food Network, and we just sit there and watch Diners, Drives, and Dies for the next three hours, okay?

1320
01:49:57,143 --> 01:49:58,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

1321
01:49:58,786 --> 01:50:00,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, good times.

1322
01:50:00,569 --> 01:50:01,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh.

1323
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:05,858
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I didn't mention this earlier in the show, but I went to a convention of sorts today.

1324
01:50:05,939 --> 01:50:06,600
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little different.

1325
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:09,685
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something called the Oddities and Curiosities Expo is here in town.

1326
01:50:10,507 --> 01:50:12,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of that, yes.

1327
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:23,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So what it is, it's kind of like the vendor hall at an anime convention, but instead of it being anime waifu merchandise, it's like Baphomet, Elvira, and Kittens Summoning Demons.

1328
01:50:23,346 --> 01:50:25,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's like all those sorts of... It's taxidermy.

1329
01:50:26,091 --> 01:50:28,134
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's all sorts of like odd little things.

1330
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:35,164
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course I ran into like multiple people I knew there just because of, you know, the circles I run in here locally.

1331
01:50:35,184 --> 01:50:36,766
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was fun.

1332
01:50:36,786 --> 01:50:38,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't end up buying anything though.

1333
01:50:38,028 --> 01:50:39,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I was kind of... I just...

1334
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:41,132
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see anything that was like, oh, I got to have it.

1335
01:50:41,153 --> 01:50:50,264
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an artist and I wish I'd gotten their business card because it was a really good Frankenfurter from Rocky Horror portrait with like snapping the pink glove.

1336
01:50:50,645 --> 01:50:58,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And it looked like the way it was like the big eyes, like it looked like a Frankenstein from the 30s kind of poster that I really kind of liked.

1337
01:50:59,016 --> 01:51:02,200
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wish I'd gotten that artist's info, but oh well.

1338
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:03,381
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what you do?

1339
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:06,164
[SPEAKER_09]: See if they have a Facebook page or a group.

1340
01:51:06,704 --> 01:51:08,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Join it and ask.

1341
01:51:08,566 --> 01:51:09,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody will know.

1342
01:51:09,767 --> 01:51:14,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that a few times where, oh, I missed this booth or this booth had this.

1343
01:51:14,532 --> 01:51:15,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know who it was?

1344
01:51:15,733 --> 01:51:16,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody has it.

1345
01:51:16,594 --> 01:51:17,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Drew, you know what?

1346
01:51:17,374 --> 01:51:25,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that you say that, I know that that account has an Instagram with stories and they post what people – and you'll see all these booths that are tagged.

1347
01:51:25,042 --> 01:51:27,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So I should just see if the individual's booth was tagged.

1348
01:51:27,384 --> 01:51:28,245
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually a really good idea.

1349
01:51:28,865 --> 01:51:29,706
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1350
01:51:29,686 --> 01:51:32,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, what did you actually want to talk to us about tonight, Ranma?

1351
01:51:33,115 --> 01:51:36,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to talk about the whole AI thing of Square Enix for a second.

1352
01:51:37,166 --> 01:51:44,326
[SPEAKER_09]: And for this, I also want to thank you because of something you said about Blue Sky that came in handy last week.

1353
01:51:44,346 --> 01:51:45,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm curious.

1354
01:51:45,228 --> 01:51:47,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand AI.

1355
01:51:47,250 --> 01:51:48,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I'm in IT.

1356
01:51:48,412 --> 01:51:49,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I see both sides of it.

1357
01:51:49,733 --> 01:51:52,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of it I'm for, some of it not so much.

1358
01:51:52,737 --> 01:51:57,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand how AI can make your job better, can make your job worse.

1359
01:51:57,342 --> 01:51:59,765
[SPEAKER_09]: It can make you lose your job.

1360
01:51:59,785 --> 01:52:01,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I get all of it.

1361
01:52:01,807 --> 01:52:09,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody on Blue Sky was talking about AI and how it's taking away all these jobs left and right for everything that's being done.

1362
01:52:09,636 --> 01:52:14,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before I jump in and say something, I have to read and see what's going on.

1363
01:52:14,607 --> 01:52:18,472
[SPEAKER_09]: and I've had to explain to people there are various types of AI out there.

1364
01:52:18,712 --> 01:52:20,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, it's not even real AI.

1365
01:52:20,514 --> 01:52:29,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what we call AI, I say it's a fancier version of Cortana or Siri, if you ask me personally.

1366
01:52:29,605 --> 01:52:30,847
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're absolutely correct.

1367
01:52:30,867 --> 01:52:33,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have anything that's yet passed the Turing test.

1368
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:34,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1369
01:52:35,893 --> 01:52:42,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this topic of AI came up on this person's feed and we're starting to have a conversation about it.

1370
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:44,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told her,

1371
01:52:44,662 --> 01:52:47,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Generative AI is the problem.

1372
01:52:48,129 --> 01:52:48,911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem.

1373
01:52:50,314 --> 01:52:54,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Narrow AI or assistive AI is the good thing.

1374
01:52:54,122 --> 01:53:00,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm explaining to her how there are video games and software and application that has AI in it to help.

1375
01:53:00,075 --> 01:53:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's part of, sometimes it's actually part of the code.

1376
01:53:03,123 --> 01:53:32,050
[SPEAKER_11]: so instead of her complimenting me back oh she quote what I said and got on her soapbox about things I said nope remove quote mute nope I am not having that best best part of Blue Sky I realize Blue Sky is missing a lot but that is one thing that the old place did not have that is so handy is that when somebody tries to quote you to dunk on you not fuck that I'm sorry if you have to quote dunk me

1377
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:33,032
[SPEAKER_09]: You're weak.

1378
01:53:33,052 --> 01:53:34,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Your family is weak.

1379
01:53:34,214 --> 01:53:35,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Your lineage is weak.

1380
01:53:35,917 --> 01:53:36,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on you.

1381
01:53:37,139 --> 01:53:38,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on your cow.

1382
01:53:38,421 --> 01:53:39,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Dishonor on your family.

1383
01:53:39,543 --> 01:53:40,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1384
01:53:40,946 --> 01:53:45,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, AI and Square Enix and QA, in a way, I get it.

1385
01:53:45,674 --> 01:53:50,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when you think about it, if the QA-ers are looking for like...

1386
01:53:51,773 --> 01:53:52,694
[SPEAKER_09]: 100 things.

1387
01:53:53,275 --> 01:53:57,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe 20 or 30 of those things are the same thing in different games.

1388
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:06,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see AI going in and automating that and then doing a quick check to see if that has been done, you know?

1389
01:54:06,733 --> 01:54:08,715
[SPEAKER_09]: That part I do understand.

1390
01:54:08,976 --> 01:54:12,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand like it's going to be 70%, you know?

1391
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:18,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, I get and I understand Square Enix's reasoning behind it.

1392
01:54:18,797 --> 01:54:20,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Games will come out quicker and so forth.

1393
01:54:21,324 --> 01:54:25,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the downside, some people will lose their jobs.

1394
01:54:25,928 --> 01:54:31,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some cases, whoever is left, their jobs will be a little bit easier, less mind-numbing.

1395
01:54:32,376 --> 01:54:32,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1396
01:54:32,777 --> 01:54:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: They might even get a bump in pay.

1397
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:41,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really up to the business culture to define is AI going to be a tool or is it going to be a replacement?

1398
01:54:41,868 --> 01:54:51,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would hope that in a few years' time, you're going to see those companies where AI is a tool are going to outperform those where AI is a replacement.

1399
01:54:52,355 --> 01:54:58,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, because when I hear about it, and I'm reading about it, I'm like, I see it's more of a tool.

1400
01:54:59,295 --> 01:55:07,157
[SPEAKER_09]: But the problem is, when you mention AI, 100% of the people that are against it

1401
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Guns blazing, shoot everybody.

1402
01:55:11,374 --> 01:55:11,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

1403
01:55:11,975 --> 01:55:13,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more nuanced than that.

1404
01:55:13,176 --> 01:55:14,638
[SPEAKER_11]: It is way more nuanced.

1405
01:55:14,999 --> 01:55:20,166
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the label AI is being used too much.

1406
01:55:20,506 --> 01:55:21,688
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the problem.

1407
01:55:21,748 --> 01:55:30,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's causing people to have that Pavlovian response to it when it's really, it's the generative AI that is the part that, you know, and how it's generating.

1408
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:36,027
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I would even go so far as to say it's not all generative AI is bad depending on how it's being trained.

1409
01:55:36,047 --> 01:55:37,810
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the key part.

1410
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:38,190
Yeah.

1411
01:55:38,170 --> 01:55:52,095
[SPEAKER_09]: and then it's like those who kind of know the difference will be up in arms and then when someone in the tech, graphic, scientific field tries to simplify it

1412
01:55:52,379 --> 01:55:54,422
[SPEAKER_09]: They look at you like, oh, you're pro AI.

1413
01:55:54,442 --> 01:55:54,903
[SPEAKER_09]: But no.

1414
01:55:55,524 --> 01:55:56,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to educate you.

1415
01:55:56,986 --> 01:56:02,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Photoshop hasn't done a damn thing different in the last 20 years, except now they're calling it AI.

1416
01:56:02,674 --> 01:56:06,099
[SPEAKER_11]: With an exception, actually, Adobe does have a generative picture thing.

1417
01:56:07,181 --> 01:56:12,909
[SPEAKER_11]: From Adobe's standpoint, I happen to know that they are saying it's trained on their own stuff.

1418
01:56:12,929 --> 01:56:14,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Adobe does not train on stuff outside.

1419
01:56:14,752 --> 01:56:16,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't work for them or anything.

1420
01:56:16,755 --> 01:56:18,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in the loop of some of their updates.

1421
01:56:18,517 --> 01:56:19,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,

1422
01:56:19,058 --> 01:56:22,402
[SPEAKER_08]: don't they train on people that don't opt out of stuff?

1423
01:56:24,265 --> 01:56:47,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you put it in creative cloud but if you sign out of it, they won't touch your stuff I'm not here to defend them, what I'm here to say is that for the most part, outside of those tools that actually do the generate me a picture of a bird kissing another bird, whatever you're into then that all the other tools are the same fucking things they've been doing for years except now they just call it AI

1424
01:56:48,235 --> 01:56:51,720
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll say this one part and I get out here so you can do emails and all of that.

1425
01:56:52,020 --> 01:57:06,741
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gotten to the point where I forget the organization but there's like 16 different Japanese companies and organizations that are basically pushing back against it and passing legislation saying it's copyright infringement right off the bat.

1426
01:57:07,342 --> 01:57:09,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's been a lot of interesting development there.

1427
01:57:10,266 --> 01:57:11,728
[SPEAKER_09]: The funny thing is

1428
01:57:11,708 --> 01:57:19,639
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably would not have heard about this happening if Jareth AI didn't start doing graphics that looked like something that came out of a Ghibli movie.

1429
01:57:20,721 --> 01:57:22,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Which that filter was all the rage.

1430
01:57:22,563 --> 01:57:25,647
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyone, of course, with the trained eye would be able to tell that it's fake.

1431
01:57:25,668 --> 01:57:32,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and all the most mediocre people you know on Facebook were running that filter on their pictures for a hot minute.

1432
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, let me say this.

1433
01:57:37,190 --> 01:57:56,312
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1434
01:57:56,292 --> 01:58:15,094
[SPEAKER_09]: look for any anime AI image and find a picture of Gadget you will see resemblance you can get 20 different anime images that was AI rendered put a picture of Gadget right next to it and if you look at her face you will see the similarities across the board amazing

1435
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:20,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I have run across some that look very realistic, but I get your point.

1436
01:58:21,009 --> 01:58:29,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to say, though, that for anyone who is a trained artist, you're also going to find anatomical inconsistencies, shading, lighting.

1437
01:58:30,523 --> 01:58:34,108
[SPEAKER_01]: You will find where a finger doesn't connect to the rest of the body.

1438
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:36,772
[SPEAKER_01]: There will always be an error.

1439
01:58:37,433 --> 01:58:40,197
[SPEAKER_09]: The lines in the artwork may be clean, but wait, hold up.

1440
01:58:40,217 --> 01:58:42,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Those lines are a little bit too clean.

1441
01:58:42,781 --> 01:58:42,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1442
01:58:43,981 --> 01:58:51,034
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even necessary that I can do artwork, run it back through Pixelmator or what have you, and have my lines be super clean.

1443
01:58:51,775 --> 01:58:55,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the issue that there'll be proportion issues.

1444
01:58:55,682 --> 01:59:00,611
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a hand that doesn't quite go the right way, a leg that's turned in an unnatural way.

1445
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:04,538
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always going to be something that tells that this is not real.

1446
01:59:05,345 --> 01:59:09,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Ranma, this is a debate that's going to continue for a long time.

1447
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:11,352
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, Ranma, thank you so much for your call.

1448
01:59:11,372 --> 01:59:12,774
[SPEAKER_11]: We always appreciate hearing from you.

1449
01:59:13,034 --> 01:59:19,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the listeners want to hear more of you, which I hope they do, they'll tune in to you and your pals on Anime Jam Session.

1450
01:59:20,003 --> 01:59:22,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, you still have a few shows before your holiday break.

1451
01:59:22,686 --> 01:59:25,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, your holiday break's not for a few weeks.

1452
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:26,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1453
01:59:28,152 --> 01:59:31,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We did announce that it's you, me, and Brad, too, with our Endeavor.

1454
01:59:32,818 --> 01:59:34,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally... When, tonight?

1455
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:42,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we did a week or so ago, but I think that... I actually don't think that was announced, but maybe you want to say something about that?

1456
01:59:43,783 --> 01:59:44,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops!

1457
01:59:44,163 --> 01:59:45,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Luke-chan!

1458
01:59:46,206 --> 01:59:47,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Breaking news.

1459
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,753
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I said something, I'm sorry.

1460
01:59:51,975 --> 01:59:55,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Well... Meow.

1461
01:59:56,281 --> 01:59:58,865
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a cat running around, somebody's let it out of a bag.

1462
01:59:59,887 --> 02:00:00,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Look over there!

1463
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:05,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that means I have to go edit that project one more time.

1464
02:00:08,195 --> 02:00:09,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1465
02:00:10,417 --> 02:00:10,978
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

1466
02:00:11,098 --> 02:00:11,699
[SPEAKER_00]: We still love you.

1467
02:00:11,759 --> 02:00:12,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.

1468
02:00:13,561 --> 02:00:14,482
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very happy.

1469
02:00:14,782 --> 02:00:18,506
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will leave it as that teaser until later.

1470
02:00:18,526 --> 02:00:18,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1471
02:00:20,888 --> 02:00:21,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, Ranma.

1472
02:00:21,529 --> 02:00:22,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Always good to hear from you.

1473
02:00:22,670 --> 02:00:24,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently we're going to hear a lot more from you.

1474
02:00:27,075 --> 02:00:27,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care, buddy.

1475
02:00:29,011 --> 02:00:29,351
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1476
02:00:30,653 --> 02:00:31,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

1477
02:00:31,914 --> 02:00:32,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get to emails.

1478
02:00:32,815 --> 02:00:35,659
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel kind of bad now, but I thought I had said something already.

1479
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:36,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

1480
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:37,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1481
02:00:37,321 --> 02:00:38,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So you said it now.

1482
02:00:38,442 --> 02:00:38,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

1483
02:00:39,002 --> 02:00:39,443
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

1484
02:00:39,843 --> 02:00:40,164
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1485
02:00:41,525 --> 02:00:41,866
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1486
02:00:42,406 --> 02:00:42,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Emails.

1487
02:00:44,128 --> 02:00:44,389
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1488
02:00:44,469 --> 02:00:45,290
[SPEAKER_01]: First email.

1489
02:00:45,470 --> 02:00:47,452
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes from DarkTetsuya.

1490
02:00:48,513 --> 02:00:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of goodbye.

1491
02:00:51,096 --> 02:00:56,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am angry at you right now, sir, because that song's been stuck in my head ever since I saw your email.

1492
02:00:57,103 --> 02:00:58,765
[SPEAKER_11]: But what a good song to have stuck in your head.

1493
02:00:58,812 --> 02:01:03,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a good song, but still, I'd like... I mean, it did replace the final countdown, so there's that.

1494
02:01:04,578 --> 02:01:05,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So, anyway.

1495
02:01:06,681 --> 02:01:08,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, OLR?

1496
02:01:08,122 --> 02:01:09,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't believe this is it.

1497
02:01:09,504 --> 02:01:13,268
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 years of Sunday nights all coming to an end, of course, for me.

1498
02:01:13,909 --> 02:01:15,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd known you all since sometime in 2000, 2001.

1499
02:01:16,331 --> 02:01:24,941
[SPEAKER_01]: A chance encountered a local Bimani party when I discovered y'all were like-minded nerds as far as Konami's note-smashing stuff is concerned.

1500
02:01:26,142 --> 02:01:26,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1501
02:01:27,297 --> 02:01:54,756
[SPEAKER_01]: but fast forward to that fateful summer in 2002 after launching the live 365 stream of Bimani Dance Mania and other sort of rhythm game music there was the debut of the Sunday Night Show and it was probably taboo to talk about numbers but back then as I recall we had all of 12 live listeners and of course I was one of the lucky ones also I agree Shane was right about the early episodes bringing that Bimani Party all night energy to the podcast what a hell of a time

1502
02:01:54,736 --> 02:02:06,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering the Solo 2000 controversy with the supposedly risque background animations and that crowd overreacting the way they tend to do, plus the first break that we ever took to Vanessa May's Destiny.

1503
02:02:06,899 --> 02:02:08,322
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a night I would never forget.

1504
02:02:09,945 --> 02:02:18,060
[SPEAKER_01]: There was for a time also the website component, which I don't know if folks knew you used to take submissions.

1505
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:26,652
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like I had the record for the most submissions, so imagine my surprise when I got the message, Hey, you want to help us backstage with stories and stuff?

1506
02:02:26,672 --> 02:02:29,575
[SPEAKER_01]: You've submitted so many, we thought we'd just let you do that on your own.

1507
02:02:29,996 --> 02:02:35,784
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was invited backstage to help pitch in, which would continue to go through the rest of the run, speaking of which.

1508
02:02:35,804 --> 02:02:47,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we eventually moved onto the podcast, first with the extra to-go episodes, and then about a year of that merged the two shows for the rest of its run.

1509
02:02:49,158 --> 02:03:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1510
02:03:08,395 --> 02:03:16,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are the other side projects I helped with to accompany the show, such as the Wikia, which we did come too close to comfort for losing.

1511
02:03:16,646 --> 02:03:23,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Eternal gratitude for Bobby Blackwolf with his help in getting it restored, and to keep a record of all our shows both past and present.

1512
02:03:23,476 --> 02:03:26,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the OL Archive, the official archive for our oldest shows.

1513
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:28,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Did y'all know 100...

1514
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I say 100.

1515
02:03:30,055 --> 02:03:37,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all know one of our former fans, Jaded, hooked me up with the most original 1.0 run of Guys on a Show.

1516
02:03:37,135 --> 02:03:39,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wanted to hear that, it's there for your listening pleasure.

1517
02:03:40,542 --> 02:03:45,391
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I know a lot of us grew, changed, graduated, got married, had families, and so on.

1518
02:03:45,711 --> 02:03:53,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I met my wife, a friend of a friend of one of the OGs, TSS Tech Angel.

1519
02:03:53,765 --> 02:03:55,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say words.

1520
02:03:55,188 --> 02:03:57,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is no small thing to say the show changed my life forever.

1521
02:03:57,953 --> 02:04:00,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the most amazing thing I've been a part of.

1522
02:04:00,978 --> 02:04:14,076
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has been a part of my life for over two decades I always said to myself what would I even do on Sundays anymore after they're over it definitely won't be the same thank you all for changing my Sunday night forever

1523
02:04:16,098 --> 02:04:18,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for that, Dr. Tutsuya.

1524
02:04:18,742 --> 02:04:22,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this show has meant a lot to you, almost as much as it has to us over the years.

1525
02:04:22,968 --> 02:04:26,913
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, everything you said in there about getting invited backstage, true.

1526
02:04:27,254 --> 02:04:36,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there was actually, it was funny, there was a point, I know you were invited backstage before that, but we had to shut down the forums at VOG Network just because of spammers and

1527
02:04:36,567 --> 02:04:40,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The forum software is just generally old technology, right?

1528
02:04:40,936 --> 02:04:42,339
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it is open to vulnerabilities.

1529
02:04:42,619 --> 02:04:43,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm oversimplifying it.

1530
02:04:43,982 --> 02:04:46,768
[SPEAKER_11]: So discords kind of became internet forums at some point.

1531
02:04:46,848 --> 02:04:49,213
[SPEAKER_11]: One could argue there's still Reddit and things like that.

1532
02:04:49,233 --> 02:04:54,103
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the most part, a lot of forum type chatter went over to something like a discord at some point.

1533
02:04:54,083 --> 02:05:22,960
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1534
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:41,573
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1535
02:05:41,553 --> 02:05:45,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for the most part, I would say like 95% of people did get that change.

1536
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:50,146
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wish other people would have realized we were always still talking about other games.

1537
02:05:50,206 --> 02:05:54,853
[SPEAKER_11]: You go back in those shows and we're talking about like Dreamcast games playing to Jamie's and things like that.

1538
02:05:54,873 --> 02:05:57,117
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, we were always talking about all games.

1539
02:05:57,137 --> 02:06:00,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, we kind of made that switch a little more official.

1540
02:06:01,083 --> 02:06:04,448
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, quite the retrospective there.

1541
02:06:04,829 --> 02:06:06,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Or should I say retrospective song?

1542
02:06:06,611 --> 02:06:08,815
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to keep the Bomani song title names.

1543
02:06:09,696 --> 02:06:10,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1544
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:13,906
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1545
02:06:13,926 --> 02:06:14,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one more email.

1546
02:06:15,288 --> 02:06:15,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

1547
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:18,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, OLR.

1548
02:06:18,512 --> 02:06:19,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your girl Mishi here.

1549
02:06:19,733 --> 02:06:27,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to express my gratitude toward you all and the members of this show because without you guys, I never would have met my best friend and partner, Dark Tetsuya.

1550
02:06:28,143 --> 02:06:30,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the memories and the wonderful show.

1551
02:06:30,606 --> 02:06:35,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll miss this on Sunday nights and I wish the OLR me the best in whatever you guys have planned for the future.

1552
02:06:36,173 --> 02:06:36,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the memories.

1553
02:06:37,134 --> 02:06:38,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night, y'all.

1554
02:06:38,135 --> 02:06:39,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Sincerely, Mishi, a.k.a.

1555
02:06:39,837 --> 02:06:40,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Mishikins.

1556
02:06:41,881 --> 02:07:02,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1557
02:07:02,924 --> 02:07:08,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy for me to sit here and say, gross, barf, but it's really adorable.

1558
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:16,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And well, if I am going to say something sassy, Mish, you and D'Artistou make straight people tolerable.

1559
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:17,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say that.

1560
02:07:19,529 --> 02:07:21,791
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and also, I do mean authentically.

1561
02:07:21,811 --> 02:07:22,792
[SPEAKER_11]: You two are adorable.

1562
02:07:23,373 --> 02:07:39,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this show had any small part in that, which is wild for me to think that this show set up relationships, but even when I think about my own marriage, this show was a way for Alan to get to know me when we lived 100 miles apart.

1563
02:07:39,307 --> 02:07:44,292
[SPEAKER_11]: So I recognize this show has enhanced or sparked some relationships out there.

1564
02:07:44,452 --> 02:07:48,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, it's wild to think about, but...

1565
02:07:48,976 --> 02:07:52,580
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of us did get married during the course of the show.

1566
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:57,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Dan and I just celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary.

1567
02:07:59,728 --> 02:08:09,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you and Alan and Matt and Nellie, and you've had small ones who are not so small anymore.

1568
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,522
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have all had our collection of felines.

1569
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:13,583
Mm-hmm.

1570
02:08:13,715 --> 02:08:19,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Rest in Peace Shermie, and Maruko, and Mr. Smush, and Sanrio.

1571
02:08:21,043 --> 02:08:23,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was your cat's name?

1572
02:08:23,806 --> 02:08:25,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Stella.

1573
02:08:26,769 --> 02:08:27,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1574
02:08:28,711 --> 02:08:30,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts to all of our pets.

1575
02:08:31,575 --> 02:08:33,337
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

1576
02:08:33,797 --> 02:08:38,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always wanted to...

1577
02:08:40,462 --> 02:09:05,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I may play like a little bit aggro like as the you know the bitchy co-host type person but it's all you know I have nothing but but cinnamon roll level feelings for for everybody and um yeah yeah all right well cinnamon roll I want a cinnamon roll now um

1578
02:09:06,128 --> 02:09:23,142
[SPEAKER_01]: um anyway Dan cinnamon rolls I think that's it for emails tonight right so that is it and um of course uh I'm gonna I'm gonna play polya because I have to play something light before bed

1579
02:09:23,122 --> 02:09:29,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email, which remember, there's only a couple weeks left to do that.

1580
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hope you will take advantage of that.

1581
02:09:32,146 --> 02:09:39,966
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have, I always want to just say by default, I don't know why my brain, I almost caught myself saying the Skype line.

1582
02:09:39,946 --> 02:09:41,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But we all know it's Discord.

1583
02:09:42,089 --> 02:09:46,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Discord will be open all night on the final night.

1584
02:09:47,336 --> 02:09:50,341
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have some other things we're going to do and play around and have a good time.

1585
02:09:51,522 --> 02:09:54,566
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I know it's hard.

1586
02:09:54,667 --> 02:09:59,013
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm torn because on one hand, I am apologetic.

1587
02:09:59,073 --> 02:10:04,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry that I'm sort of the starter to...

1588
02:10:04,280 --> 02:10:06,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Say, hey, I want to tap the brakes on this.

1589
02:10:06,843 --> 02:10:17,938
[SPEAKER_11]: But on the other hand, I also know that for myself and just my batteries and my just... I don't want to say my mental health, but in part it is that.

1590
02:10:17,958 --> 02:10:29,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to make this decision that's very difficult to just allow myself to take some time to stop because I've been working nonstop every day for so long.

1591
02:10:29,452 --> 02:10:33,898
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean that I love you all any less, all of you.

1592
02:10:33,878 --> 02:10:41,286
[SPEAKER_11]: It just means I am recognizing that I just have to put myself first, which is hard to do sometimes.

1593
02:10:41,306 --> 02:10:45,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sometimes takes... Especially when that decision affects other people.

1594
02:10:46,632 --> 02:10:47,232
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1595
02:10:47,252 --> 02:10:48,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It does.

1596
02:10:48,373 --> 02:10:49,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And that makes it harder.

1597
02:10:49,695 --> 02:10:50,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1598
02:10:50,596 --> 02:10:50,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1599
02:10:53,799 --> 02:10:54,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1600
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:59,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm trying to look at...

1601
02:10:59,748 --> 02:11:19,866
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1602
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:37,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stuff earlier, I'm really happy to hear who is also involved in that because like in particular, I think, well, number one, you have quite the Super Smash Brothers of VOG personalities over the years coming together, which I think is incredible.

1603
02:11:37,284 --> 02:11:41,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really excited for Brad to have an outlet like that again as well, I think is also like...

1604
02:11:41,851 --> 02:12:08,820
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1605
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:21,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I scream at everybody in my DBD matches, I've got great people in my life who help me with that too, like Shay and Shadow, who have been in my chats a lot, and Brad and Mike and everybody.

1606
02:12:21,714 --> 02:12:35,088
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of OLR people supported me, and I really appreciate you being there with me for that venture and sticking with me even though I'm dating pigeons in games sometimes.

1607
02:12:35,108 --> 02:12:36,790
[SPEAKER_01]: VOGtron, Matt.

1608
02:12:37,711 --> 02:12:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1609
02:12:38,855 --> 02:12:46,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to go make a bean quesadilla so that I can not sniff.

1610
02:12:46,329 --> 02:12:46,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Quesadilla.

1611
02:12:48,914 --> 02:12:51,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I ever tell you the story about the case of beer?

1612
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,521
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this.

1613
02:12:52,561 --> 02:12:53,282
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last story.

1614
02:12:55,567 --> 02:12:58,412
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a restaurant in Mobile, Alabama called El Chico.

1615
02:12:58,452 --> 02:12:59,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It was our favorite.

1616
02:12:59,274 --> 02:13:02,179
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd all have family meetups and everything there.

1617
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:26,648
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were there with my uncle's wife and her parents at the time and my grandma was running late and so like hey should I order for Juliet and like yeah she wants a quesadilla well I didn't know Juliet drank she thought grandma said a case of beer so there you go a case of beer

1618
02:13:26,982 --> 02:13:27,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, okay.

1619
02:13:27,823 --> 02:13:29,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'll see, I like a quesadilla.

1620
02:13:30,686 --> 02:13:37,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever, okay, but my new obsession in the late night Mexican food department, not just a quesadilla, but a quesaburria.

1621
02:13:38,094 --> 02:13:39,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you had one of those?

1622
02:13:39,836 --> 02:13:40,577
[SPEAKER_11]: What is this?

1623
02:13:41,198 --> 02:13:41,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

1624
02:13:41,879 --> 02:13:43,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I don't know what they do to it.

1625
02:13:43,901 --> 02:13:46,824
[SPEAKER_08]: They soak it in consomme.

1626
02:13:46,844 --> 02:13:48,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they soak it and they fry it.

1627
02:13:48,907 --> 02:13:51,990
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it gives it like just extra fat on that.

1628
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:52,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Gasp.

1629
02:13:52,811 --> 02:13:54,333
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good.

1630
02:13:54,353 --> 02:13:55,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good.

1631
02:13:55,794 --> 02:13:56,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Gasp.

1632
02:13:57,053 --> 02:13:59,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I require Thursday.

1633
02:14:01,037 --> 02:14:03,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where the fuck to get quesadillas in this town, but you know what?

1634
02:14:03,959 --> 02:14:04,640
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll find something.

1635
02:14:05,681 --> 02:14:06,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Everywhere.

1636
02:14:06,162 --> 02:14:07,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a lot of places.

1637
02:14:07,463 --> 02:14:14,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, any hole-in-the-wall Mexican place is going to have it, but it was LA where I had it for the first time, and I fell in love.

1638
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:16,391
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

1639
02:14:16,571 --> 02:14:20,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll have to see if my stomach can handle it, but let's make this happen.

1640
02:14:20,235 --> 02:14:23,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Victoria and I had DoorDash Mexican food at like 1 in the morning.

1641
02:14:23,438 --> 02:14:24,078
[SPEAKER_11]: It was incredible.

1642
02:14:24,699 --> 02:14:24,799
Okay.

1643
02:14:25,150 --> 02:14:25,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.

1644
02:14:25,952 --> 02:14:26,933
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1645
02:14:26,953 --> 02:14:27,314
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1646
02:14:27,394 --> 02:14:27,835
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1647
02:14:28,416 --> 02:14:37,594
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, we got bedtimes to happen and, and Pally is to play and shows to edit and, and, and, and give me your money.

1648
02:14:37,814 --> 02:14:38,035
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1649
02:14:38,055 --> 02:14:39,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1650
02:14:39,517 --> 02:14:41,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Then before I get your final thought, DarkSakura, I'll let you go.

1651
02:14:41,822 --> 02:14:44,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me ask Loki real quick if there's any last minute stories.

1652
02:14:46,463 --> 02:14:47,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1653
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:50,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we'll get to DarkSakura, your final thought.

1654
02:14:50,271 --> 02:14:56,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I guess I should say, you know, I usually end this show with saying, you know, something like, if you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend, help us spread the word.

1655
02:14:56,504 --> 02:14:57,707
[SPEAKER_11]: That is all still true.

1656
02:14:58,147 --> 02:15:02,356
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, especially I would say, tell somebody who used to listen to us to come back, please.

1657
02:15:02,456 --> 02:15:03,799
[SPEAKER_11]: You got two nights left to do it.

1658
02:15:04,280 --> 02:15:06,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we that podcast that someone used to know?

1659
02:15:06,545 --> 02:15:09,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's kind of how it goes for a lot of people.

1660
02:15:09,671 --> 02:15:18,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week, I did what I promised I would do, even though it broke every fiber of my being, and I logged into X, and I made a post.

1661
02:15:18,967 --> 02:15:21,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was somebody who replied the equivalent of OMG.

1662
02:15:22,433 --> 02:15:25,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So it got, you know, we're trying to let people know.

1663
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:29,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And PodCulture says, spay and neuter your pets, also your neighbors.

1664
02:15:30,007 --> 02:15:30,207
Of course.

1665
02:15:31,334 --> 02:15:33,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Your neighbor's pets or your neighbors?

1666
02:15:33,257 --> 02:15:34,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I would say... Your neighbors.

1667
02:15:34,559 --> 02:15:35,480
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1668
02:15:36,021 --> 02:15:37,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And Petapossum.

1669
02:15:37,744 --> 02:15:41,709
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, I will just say thank you for all of your support over the years.

1670
02:15:41,729 --> 02:15:44,874
[SPEAKER_11]: As you all know by now, our last show is in two weeks.

1671
02:15:44,894 --> 02:15:51,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's bittersweet, but we are so thankful to all of you that have kept this powered for 23 and a half years.

1672
02:15:51,644 --> 02:15:56,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you think about all the shows in the history of the internet...

1673
02:15:56,832 --> 02:16:04,329
[SPEAKER_11]: All of the shows in the history of the internet, there are very few, very few on any topic that have gone this long.

1674
02:16:04,750 --> 02:16:06,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few on any topic that has gone this long.

1675
02:16:06,835 --> 02:16:12,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the world of video games, there is one that has gone this long.

1676
02:16:12,087 --> 02:16:16,492
[SPEAKER_11]: and another one in Spain that took an entire year off, but that's neither here nor there.

1677
02:16:16,512 --> 02:16:20,175
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's one that's gone this long consistently and that's this one.

1678
02:16:20,195 --> 02:16:30,466
[SPEAKER_11]: So unfortunately it had to end someday, but you guys have made this a hell of a ride, a world record run, literally, here on this show.

1679
02:16:30,506 --> 02:16:31,427
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for your support.

1680
02:16:32,708 --> 02:16:34,831
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, DarkSakura, your final thought?

1681
02:16:40,416 --> 02:16:40,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a dollar.

1682
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:43,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what's your Venmo?

1683
02:16:43,342 --> 02:16:44,784
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just kidding.

1684
02:16:45,165 --> 02:16:46,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And possums are awesome.

1685
02:16:46,547 --> 02:16:50,793
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat ticks and other terrible things, and they are almost immune to rabies.

1686
02:16:52,656 --> 02:16:53,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So, go pet a possum.

1687
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, have a good stream, DarkSakura.

1688
02:16:55,701 --> 02:16:56,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, don't.

1689
02:16:56,042 --> 02:16:58,025
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just hiss at you.

1690
02:16:58,045 --> 02:16:58,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good stream.

1691
02:17:00,128 --> 02:17:02,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye!

1692
02:17:02,231 --> 02:17:03,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, we're over to you.

1693
02:17:03,553 --> 02:17:05,196
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your final thought for us tonight?

1694
02:17:05,716 --> 02:17:16,182
[SPEAKER_08]: hopefully I'll have my modded series ready to go soon because I've been working on that for a while now keep tweaking things I think we're almost to a point where I can do it

1695
02:17:18,153 --> 02:17:23,203
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is I went to a drag brunch today.

1696
02:17:23,343 --> 02:17:27,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So a friend of a friend was in from out of town and my friend wanted me to meet him.

1697
02:17:27,090 --> 02:17:30,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So we all went to drag brunch together and that was a lot of fun.

1698
02:17:30,256 --> 02:17:31,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Very high energy.

1699
02:17:31,158 --> 02:17:32,621
[SPEAKER_11]: The drag performers did very well.

1700
02:17:32,641 --> 02:17:34,805
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly have nothing negative to say in that department.

1701
02:17:34,905 --> 02:17:41,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say sometimes you bachelorette party girls need to behave yourselves at those events, but...

1702
02:17:41,137 --> 02:17:41,998
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fine.

1703
02:17:42,018 --> 02:17:42,659
[SPEAKER_11]: The show was good.

1704
02:17:42,699 --> 02:17:47,784
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I think that just all goes to say, support your local artists.

1705
02:17:48,265 --> 02:17:52,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I say this a lot when I'm hosting shows live, and I probably need to say it more here.

1706
02:17:52,569 --> 02:18:04,242
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I can literally have final words as I am, you know, sunsetting this whole thing, support your local artists, drag performers, burlesque performers, dancers.

1707
02:18:04,222 --> 02:18:10,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Local artists showing in art galleries, choirs and vocal groups, pole dance troupes, you name it.

1708
02:18:10,869 --> 02:18:12,591
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all sorts of art out there.

1709
02:18:12,671 --> 02:18:15,935
[SPEAKER_11]: There is something for you and there's somebody locally producing it.

1710
02:18:15,975 --> 02:18:18,277
[SPEAKER_11]: So please support your local artists.

1711
02:18:19,258 --> 02:18:21,701
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that, we're going to roll credits.

1712
02:18:22,562 --> 02:18:25,045
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you next week for episode number 1069.

1713
02:18:25,185 --> 02:18:26,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1714
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:31,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Of Orange Slouch Radio.

1715
02:18:31,412 --> 02:18:31,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Good night.

1716
02:18:33,061 --> 02:18:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1717
02:18:37,708 --> 02:18:40,993
