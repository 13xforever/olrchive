9953	17362	Classic DDR players quickly learned how prolific Naoki was with his many pseudonyms, but there was a strong list of others that made or were part of certified classics too.
17542	20626	Session musicians and vocalists, licensed producers, and so on.
20646	23830	I wasn't aware until looking up credits just how diverse Mauro Farina was.
24090	29096	From the Eurocheese of Boom Boom Dollar, to the utter bop that was MaxUS's exclusive You Leave Me Alone.
29437	31219	Rest in peace, you legend.
34658	36366	May a true artist's art live forever.
36607	41189	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the last few weeks in gaming news.
41209	43420	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
45391	47915	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
47935	53042	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
53063	63558	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight in November the 2nd of 2025 with episode number 1067 of our show.
64059	70048	Off after a quick break last week and we're back again for our final month of episodes.
70028	98145	Hello, Loki, how are you?
98716	108426	It wasn't until I watched you or your video tonight, because we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
108446	112931	That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
113432	118897	And if you do watch us live, sometimes there's little things going on on the video, such as Loki with games in the background.
118918	125044	And you have the brand new Katamari game going behind you tonight, which I forgot came out because I was a little bit...
125024	139303	I was at a work thing this week and then I went to Disneyland and so like my mind kind of wasn't on video game news quite honestly for most of the week so I like forgot there was a new Katamari that came out um so I'm very curious did you get to play it?
140026	167788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
168663	170206	Oh my god, my feet.
170226	172028	My feet still hate me.
172049	174653	The panel was great, and it's actually one of the better ones.
174733	179881	Even though this is like the first year, even though I wanted to go to panels, I actually didn't go to any of them.
180021	180402	Oh wow.
180542	183267	I was too busy with people.
185631	192021	I got to meet up with a ton of DBD people, a lot of people I know in person.
192001	205842	Trixie Mattel was out of drag at PEX on Thursday night.
206598	214049	So, um, but I got to, it was, it was packed like sardine in there, like just so, so many people, but I got to run into a lot of my friends.
214069	221300	I went to the drag show on Friday and, um, I actually was glad that I got in a day early.
222021	222822	I, I, I had it in my head.
222842	232717	I was gonna drive down Thursday and went Wednesday instead because I got, did my hotel room stupidly, but I'm glad I did because that extra day I could go pre-reg and then just chill and do whatever.
232777	233398	Um,
233378	256821	um and then um and I tried not to really obligate myself to doing more than I wanted to like I was gonna do um the uh the other drag show the one that um Drag Trashly does oh and I'm not going um I actually skipped on a couple of things just because I wanted to chill um yeah we all need a people break now and then
257493	259516	But the big day was Saturday.
259937	267908	Also, it's so funny because now some of the people, especially at Stream Elements, there's a couple people there who recognize me now.
268870	270071	Oh, cool.
270092	272054	So shout out to my Stream Elements friends.
274037	282690	But I also went to the Horror Games Meetup, which was predominantly Dead by Daylight people and a bunch of people cosplaying.
282670	299683	Allura Bliss, Tanis the Disco, Mikayla
299663	301545	and just all kinds of people.
301645	308133	I found a Fong and an Ace cosplayer.
308794	312198	There's a picture of me sneaking up on them as Pig.
312979	313880	It was great.
313900	316022	It's just so many awesome people.
316143	317764	I met so many fun streamers.
318425	324152	I connected with a few industry folks for...
324132	334483	doing some promos and actually a gaming idea I might have for a fully blind accessible game that I have an idea for.
334523	335705	I'm not going to say much more about it.
337947	338988	I'll just put it this way.
339008	342472	I have to learn a lot more about haptics to implement my idea.
345135	350241	So moving through that though, Sunday was just the chill day.
350261	352283	It was the day I went around and just like
353647	355630	I was Swag Day, actually.
355650	358595	I just called it Swag Day because that's the day I just did everything.
360999	364264	I won some stuff.
365567	366588	Oh, really?
366608	366909	That's fun.
366929	374962	Yeah, I just got a couple of some dice and a Jeff the Landshark U2s.
375823	379249	I have a Phasmophobia mug that I...
379229	387349	may or may not be doing something with as a giveaway perhaps we'll see um
387548	397742	I, um, and then, uh, I went to a party Sunday night and, um, it was the, the, the big dead by daylight streamer meetup.
397943	398704	It was packed.
398864	400066	It was horrible.
400086	401428	I just, not horrible.
401448	404612	I mean, it was great, but I didn't really go in and drink or do anything.
404672	408297	I just hung outside with a couple of, uh, new, uh, new friends.
408318	409760	Horribly claustrophobic.
409980	410080	Yeah.
410060	412423	Yeah, it was way too busy.
413625	418032	I did go to this arcade that was across the street.
418052	422798	It's like you pay at the door and then it's free play for everything, although the crane games are pretty expensive.
424060	427786	But I did win a chocolate cream Kirby.
429208	429748	Random?
429849	430429	Okay, cool.
430449	430870	It's cute.
431558	434963	I'll try to find out where the crap I put themselves into a picture.
436726	444898	I just played a lot of classic games, which I mean, I guess I could transition a bit into my gaming two weeks.
445719	447943	But they had a bunch of the Beimani stuff.
447963	452790	They had a full official Guitarrera set up, but it was down to the count.
452770	458497	I'd have to look at my phone because you know me, whenever I go somewhere and play things, I take pictures of everything that I play.
458938	460419	They did not have the para para this year.
460439	464244	I was really disappointed at TwitchCon, but they had a bunch of other stuff.
464284	465386	It was pretty neat.
467749	472575	And of course, I think everyone fell in love with my cat because I show everybody pictures of Midna.
473736	481866	And so I had to, though, head back to be able to check into my hotel before midnight in Anaheim because I did go to Disneyland and
481846	488633	and I did walk over 20,000 steps at Disneyland and murdered my feet.
490047	500863	I actually had to go by Nick's place on the way back home to drop off something for him to give to a friend.
501184	507534	And my direction started to take me to Barstow, so I had to turn back around a different way and went past some ghost towns.
507554	508335	It was kind of interesting.
509196	514384	And then went up 99 Circus Top at my favorite Bravo Farms.
514364	515668	Does he still live in the North?
515688	519118	I mean, obviously, I don't want to dox him, but does he still live in the North LA area?
519178	520562	I think it's general enough.
521866	522749	He moved.
522769	523010	Okay.
523110	523932	Oh, okay.
524053	524634	I didn't know that.
524695	527523	I didn't know he moved, but I didn't think he moved far.
527603	528225	So that's interesting.
528285	528947	All right.
529383	531246	Yeah, I mean, still basic area.
531386	533229	I'll tell you a little bit more.
534451	543186	Oh, also, one of the booths at TwitchCon had like the big, you know, like the thing with all the pins and you push your hand through it, it makes a picture of your hand.
544167	545890	I did one that says OLR.
546190	548995	How Radio Shack of the 90s did.
548975	550437	to have those pins.
550457	551639	Was that where those would always be?
551659	552601	Those little pin boards?
552701	553322	That's fun though.
553342	554323	They were there.
554484	557568	But I would always think the large ones like the Exploratorium.
557588	558710	Oh, the Exploratorium.
558770	559371	Yeah, yeah.
559511	560313	I like the big ones.
560373	561855	Actually, I think that's where I first saw them.
561875	564940	Spencer's, you're right, had those knockoffs for a long time.
564960	566282	Like the neon ones.
566302	567844	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
567924	569667	Classic, not real nails.
570035	598472	Arcade Monsters Arcade Monsters Arcade Monsters
598942	620865	The D&D Pinball, Walking Dead Pinball, the Guitar Dora was down, I played Twinkle Star Sprites on an arcade cabinet and I was happy They're a pretty small chain too, they have some across the United States, I remember last year I kept eyeing them up because I wanted to go there but I just never got around to it
621436	640120	Street Fighter X Mega Man Poppin' Music Puyo Puyo Esports Pokken Tournament
641197	666411	Dance Evolution, Chase Chase Jokers, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, X-Men vs. Street Fighter 2, Vampire Hunter 2, Super Dodgeball, Bust-a-Move, X-Men Pinball, Sunset Riders,
667657	693380	Dungeons and Dragons, Tower of Doom Tetris Plus I didn't really play that though They had the Sailor Moon Adventure game, I played that They had Zoltar, they had Contra Evolution I played Tank Tank Tank because I am always happy whenever I play Tank Tank Tank I haven't seen that game in years They had the Where's Waldo cabinet except it was Japanese one so it was Where's Wally They have a Where's Waldo game?
693841	697444	I know the Nintendo game but oh wow I never knew that, that's crazy
697525	708161	So, I mean, it's lots of stuff, but I really just, I had fun meeting up with friends and hanging out and walking around and just doing.
709263	718897	Okay, I have to address the elephant in the room that SSJ100 Matt brought up about the security issue.
719879	725507	So there is a streamer who was attacked at her meet and greet.
727630	730785	I'm trying to remember her name because she's no one I follow.
731107	731529	Emeru.
731690	734704	Yeah, it's Emeru.
736017	762784	and uh she was um there for her meet and greet and then some person just rushes up on her and grabs her tries to kiss her the TwitchCon staff really didn't do much it was her own staff that pushed them off and got her away and she um she posted um
764553	778253	that this person crossed multiple barriers at TwitchCon and got in front of other creators to meet her and basically negated what the Twitch official response was.
778273	784722	She said it was a blatant lie and that her assailant was not immediately caught or detained.
784702	791596	She says, this is a quote, he was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me.
792317	798930	It feels like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it and not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal.
800294	806331	and then her manager contacted the police and she's pressing charges.
807033	814574	Twitch was going to suspend the guy for 30 days and then went to an indefinite ban after she pushed back.
814594	816058	But they were
816038	824997	They were saying that, this is what they said, in line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident.
825318	831832	We immediately bought this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events.
831852	833997	Clearly, that is not how it happened.
835073	857166	um the video of the incident is really scary it was yeah around social media and it's one of those like you know that could have been a lot worse I mean not not that it was good don't get me wrong I'm not but it was like that could have been a lot worse like just I'm shocked at how he was really able to just walk right up to her essentially yeah it was wild to me
858344	883263	Oh, and also I am trying to see if there was... Okay, so five days ago there is a post put out that Clancy, Dan Clancy, the CEO guy, he finally put out an official apology.
884064	885887	Although like
887200	890103	Why do they put stuff on their freaking Twitter?
890123	894647	Because why not do something that actually means something?
895388	896669	But I'll read what he said.
897410	900713	It shouldn't have happened, and we take that very seriously.
900773	903636	We failed both in allowing it to occur and in our response following.
904036	907980	We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made.
908060	910663	I apologize to Emeru for all that took place.
911183	913866	Because he went on and said some things himself.
914622	939482	um the last thing on here you put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously um I'm gonna say this now I am not you know a big streamer I have my groups you know I have my people um I did not feel at all unsafe for myself I also am uh you know
940289	942474	Pretty vocal if someone steps to me.
942574	948327	I am going to very loudly say something about it and probably punch them, maybe.
949430	958129	But all that aside, I do think that if you are a high-profile person in that situation...
959206	972979	You need to have the security detail, whether or not you are teeny tiny like Amaru, I'm saying physically, or a behemoth giant of a human being.
973668	975670	You always need to have security detail.
975690	977112	It needs to be stepped up.
977132	980436	They started removing the ability to bring a friend in line with you.
982017	983599	So the whole plus one thing is gone.
984320	993070	I don't know if they're going to reinstate it next year, but even so, they need to step up their game.
993090	994471	This was absolute mismanagement.
994491	1002240	Of course, I heard about it because I got a text from Sterlok, who, thank you for being concerned for...
1003317	1012328	My well-being, but it wasn't like this was a big full-out someone ran into TwitchCon and tried to set it on fire or anything.
1012929	1016854	This was an isolated thing for that day.
1016874	1019597	And I was nowhere near where it happened.
1019617	1025945	I was going to say, respectfully, I know you would be nowhere near that VIP area because that's just not how you roll on Twitch.
1026686	1027407	I don't care about it.
1027427	1028949	They're just fucking people.
1029910	1032413	I mean, it's...
1033844	1059295	I'll put it this way even if I was ever a biggest streamer is that I wouldn't want to fucking meet all those people I'll have a panel maybe and I'll just you know say some shit at a panel panels are fun oh yeah there's a thing about Emerus couldn't bring her chosen person because he got kicked out for touching somebody when he was trying to get them away from her
1059832	1061334	He got banned last year, I think.
1061454	1063376	But that says he was holding someone back.
1064317	1065257	No, he didn't hold someone back.
1065318	1068561	He detained somebody, essentially.
1068581	1073586	But it was someone who was trying to attack his client.
1073606	1074527	He was doing his job.
1074687	1081934	Yeah, they're going to have to figure all that out because Emer is not the only one who's saying, I'm out for next year's TwitchCon.
1081954	1083096	There is a ripple effect happening here.
1083116	1084557	But there were already people out this year.
1084537	1088943	Yeah, so I'd be very curious to see what the ripple effect is for next year.
1089083	1095432	I know there's still a lot of small to medium streamers that want to go meet their people, kind of like your story here.
1096093	1105566	I'm wondering if some of this VIP culture element changes, but at the same time, one could argue the VIPs, even if we don't follow them personally...
1105546	1108631	Um, they, they draw a lot of people in to the con.
1108691	1111656	There are a lot of people that go to meet the VIP people.
1111676	1116243	Um, so it's going to be interesting to see how Twitch sort of finds that balance for next year.
1116744	1118266	Um, yeah.
1118287	1118627	Interesting.
1120069	1120450	Yeah.
1120470	1121412	But it's got to be secret.
1123455	1124196	But, I mean...
1125020	1135275	Other than that one thing that I did not in person witness or hear anything about until after it had happened, I was fine.
1135295	1136697	I had a great time.
1136717	1138941	I enjoyed meeting all my people.
1139101	1143407	I did get orange juice from an orange all over my shoe by poor Doc Martens.
1143427	1144308	It really needed to be cleaned.
1144749	1145330	It was in costume.
1145430	1148254	I thought like an Orange Lounge radio fan gave you orange juice.
1148274	1149576	I thought that's where this was going.
1149596	1150478	That makes me sad.
1150498	1150898	No.
1151339	1154383	They were free oranges that were at the meet and greet rooms.
1154604	1154824	Oh, thanks.
1154804	1157929	I did go to the guild's meet and greets, so that was fun.
1158370	1159612	I ran into Funko Beard.
1161035	1164281	I told Funko Beard he's officially my gunkle.
1164581	1167386	What crappy affiliate giveaway did they give this year?
1167426	1174398	Because I remember the last year I went was like keys for a mechanical keyboard that I'll never use in my life.
1174418	1175119	I don't fucking remember.
1175160	1177063	Would they give you a bookmark?
1177083	1177183	What?
1178345	1180308	They have those little plastic bags again.
1180548	1182551	Those little plastic things from last year.
1184033	1188960	I, however, did get three Leon Kennedy blood splattered shirts.
1189882	1190402	That's fun.
1191244	1194508	And a copy of Just Dance 25 that I need to redeem.
1194528	1196111	I'm actually kind of jealous of that.
1196191	1199055	Savalos in chat says, I heard Orange Julius.
1199075	1204623	Yo, if an OLR fan wants to win my heart real fast, bring me a fucking Orange Julius.
1204823	1206045	Do it.
1206065	1206986	That'd be amazing.
1207307	1207407	Yeah.
1208973	1213278	Anyway, not that that's going to happen anytime soon.
1213298	1215180	We'll be leaving a lot of widows after this month.
1216742	1217083	All right.
1218905	1219205	Let's see.
1219545	1220987	We'll come back to you in a little bit.
1221027	1222249	Oh, I did buy a bookmark.
1222809	1224311	Did you buy a bookmark?
1224331	1225512	I did buy a couple of bookmarks.
1225613	1225833	Yeah.
1226333	1230478	No, they're useful, but I just, you know, they're not particularly expensive.
1231439	1233662	I got to see my favorite dice vendor, too, so that was cool.
1234563	1237967	And I bought a candle.
1238470	1240814	I don't remember the candle, but it's Lemony.
1240834	1242076	I was going to say, what scent?
1242136	1244380	It's from the same, it's the guy and his wife.
1244440	1246063	She makes candles and he does the dice.
1246263	1249669	Was there still like the whole like artist alley in the back sort of thing?
1249769	1250471	Okay, that's cute.
1250631	1252855	Yeah, I actually bought the cutest hat.
1252875	1257222	It's a bucket hat, but it's black velour with a cat face on it and cat ears.
1257472	1259254	I missed TwitchCon this year.
1259334	1262298	I feel like I've just been a little bit out of the loop on Twitch culture.
1262439	1267265	I lurk in people's channels, but I've been very not active in people's channels.
1267345	1272352	I just feel like October, personally, I had a lot of stuff going on.
1272572	1275716	I had a very, very big show that weekend.
1275776	1277198	I was not going to be able to get to TwitchCon.
1277599	1282165	But if the cards align next year, I would love to go back just because I like a lot of the community.
1282205	1283867	I like a lot of the people that I see there.
1283847	1300270	and plus if it's in San Diego it's not that far like I like that it's on the west coast I'm gonna lean into the west coast privilege thing a little bit because it was a lot easier to go than if it was like in New York I had the best drive I had the best drive really though my drive down was really smooth my drive back
1300250	1320267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1320247	1322570	This was a completely different aspect of it.
1322670	1325093	These mountains did not look like the mountains that I remember.
1326895	1329659	So when I got past, I found myself a place to go pee.
1329679	1332202	You must have been in Lancaster or some shit, way out there.
1332322	1332983	Something like that.
1333904	1338890	But I found my place to go pee, and then I rerouted my map, and it took me back.
1338910	1341994	So I was only another hour-ish out of my way.
1342935	1349764	Also, Dan loaned me his car refrigerator thing.
1350942	1354185	It's like an electric ice chest is kind of more what it's like.
1354465	1354966	That's cool.
1355106	1361692	So I had, you know, I had, you know, nice cold snacks with me and my drinks were cold.
1362332	1367197	And so when I stopped at Bravo Farms to buy copious amounts of cheese, which I got cheese for you.
1367737	1369979	I remember you texting me about that.
1369999	1370540	Everyone.
1371521	1378587	And by the way, Savalas, I think I've beaten you now because I found pumpkin spice cheese and I bought it for Rob.
1380845	1386892	Do they have any Trader Joe's?
1386992	1391937	To be fair, I have scaled way back on the pumpkin spice thing in recent years.
1393719	1394140	But anyway.
1396262	1397223	Sounds like you had a good time.
1397904	1399486	I hope the timing works out.
1399506	1401468	I'd love to go back next year, but we'll see.
1401829	1407915	I did also have I came back with fudge and Dan and I consumed it all.
1407935	1410278	They had carrot cake flavor and I
1410258	1411401	You know, me and Carrot Cake.
1412464	1418842	I also find it funny that you and I were both at Disneyland separately, but like a week and a half apart.
1418862	1421449	Like not that far apart, all things considered.
1421911	1424277	Yeah, and we sent each other the same selfie, everyone.
1424458	1424959	We did, we did.
1425867	1430033	I sent Rob a picture of me on the teacups, and then Rob sent him on the teacups.
1430134	1430554	That's right.
1430755	1431235	That's right.
1431396	1432237	I knew you'd appreciate it.
1433699	1434821	All right.
1434981	1436163	We are a video game podcast.
1436203	1437866	We talk about gaming news here once in a while.
1437886	1444496	Since we were gone last week, again, I had a work thing that was mandatory for a few days.
1444516	1445337	Mandatory fun.
1445357	1446559	But it was actually...
1446539	1449743	And I'm not just saying this because I know my boss listens to this show.
1449823	1450124	Hi.
1450885	1457693	But I actually did legit have a good time because we all work online and we work, you know, hybrid and at home and stuff.
1457934	1462119	So it was really lovely to see a bunch of people in person and just kind of like get to do stuff for a few days.
1462740	1469809	And then it was really lovely to just take an extra day and go to Disneyland, which I originally thought would be like a trip with coworkers.
1469829	1472032	But then it kind of slowly became, oh, never mind.
1472052	1473173	I'm not going to stay a day.
1473574	1476057	So I called Victoria and
1476037	1485111	And when I kind of started to sense that, like, all right, I don't think many of my coworkers are going to go, I called Victoria and she was, of course, in like a flash.
1485471	1496608	And then thanks to a very, very generous person out there, you know who you are, I was able to get into the parks for free, which I really, really appreciated and just able to, you know, just have a great day at the parks.
1496808	1499152	So, but yeah, kept me busy last week.
1500594	1500694	Yeah.
1500674	1505000	So we didn't have a show on Sunday, but we missed a lot of gaming news.
1505280	1509586	So, Loki, I would love for you to talk about one of the big headlines we missed last week.
1509606	1512190	Just some small stuff happening in the world.
1512390	1513532	Yeah, yeah.
1513632	1515815	I mean, we knew this was eventually going to happen.
1515875	1523205	We probably thought it was going to happen a lot sooner than now because with all the multi-platform stuff coming out from Xbox, it's like...
1523185	1528472	One of these days we're going to have Halo on PlayStation, and sure enough, now we do.
1528532	1540809	We have Halo Campaign Evolved, which is a remake of the original Halo game in Unreal 5, and now it's going to be multi-platform.
1541050	1544555	It'll be on the Xbox, PC, and PlayStation 5.
1544695	1546257	But not Switch, too.
1546726	1555521	Not Switch 2 because I don't think it has Switch 2 will be getting Halo Combat Evolved, the original Xbox game, and it will barely be able to run.
1556007	1557429	No great loss, it's just Halo.
1558270	1566781	I do find it funny that more people are talking... Like, the fact that this is also on Xbox is being completely overlooked.
1566801	1570365	I feel like... Well, I shouldn't say completely, but majorly overlooked.
1570385	1574130	Like, everybody's talking about, oh, this PS5 version is coming.
1574150	1576092	The PS5 version of Halo is coming.
1576113	1578876	And it's like, you know it is going to be on the...
1578856	1599598	Xbox Platform 2 but I just feel people are pivoting so fast to a world where maybe Xbox isn't a player anymore and maybe we'll talk more about that later but now it's talking about the PlayStation 5 I am not usually as big on the original Halo as I am like Halo 2 and maybe 3
1600085	1616961	Yeah, and what's interesting about it, it is the campaign.
1618063	1619967	It doesn't have the multiplayer version.
1620385	1621547	Oh, I missed that part.
1621567	1623430	They're not even bothering to put in multiplayer?
1623610	1625093	No, there's no multiplayer.
1625233	1626155	It's the campaign.
1626275	1630041	Co-op for two players in split screen or up to four players online.
1630081	1633647	Crossplay is supported, but it's not like the multiplayer.
1633908	1634889	Here's my thought on this.
1635230	1640178	I think that they're doing the campaign as it's... They're going the Call of Duty route.
1640198	1645347	They're doing the campaign as this, and then they're going to do a free-to-play...
1645327	1648932	Why get $60 from you once when they can get it from you twice?
1649252	1650915	Oh, you think there'll be a free-to-play multiplayer?
1651696	1659787	I think it'll be free-to-play, but it'll have microtransactions, passes out the wazoo, like Call of Duty.
1660087	1661869	Or perks if you have Game Pass type of thing.
1662270	1668258	I could see where maybe they don't want to cannibalize a multiplayer Halo thing they have coming next year.
1668919	1669680	I think...
1669660	1673147	Maybe.
1673247	1673568	Yeah.
1674069	1686555	Yeah.
1687160	1688944	Well, still, what do we think?
1689104	1691169	Cats and dogs living together in mass hysteria?
1691330	1697343	Like, you know, Halo... It's not as shocking anymore now that we've had so many games coming out.
1697403	1702695	And honestly, like, you know, we've... I think we've long moved past this whole console war nonsense.
1703177	1703397	Like...
1704052	1704513	I don't know.
1704773	1705715	I'm super with you actually.
1705735	1706856	We've all just grown up.
1706876	1711123	Like Forza and Sea of Thieves and the other things already coming to PlayStation.
1711163	1712265	This was an inevitability.
1712285	1713186	This was going to happen.
1714428	1715570	Just imagine for a second.
1715670	1716912	Imagine for a second.
1717252	1718274	We take consoles out of it.
1718294	1724203	Let's update the whole dynamic to something that's more current.
1724183	1746782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1747657	1776280	Um...
1777002	1784652	Yeah, I think the thing about this is that the optics is a little weird to me.
1784672	1787736	I think the timing of this is not great.
1788077	1792082	And I realize they didn't decide the week before when to announce this.
1792102	1795867	There's a lot of thought that goes into the rollout campaign and the when and all that.
1795887	1797889	So I completely understand that.
1797909	1799492	I want to get that out of the way.
1799512	1802115	But that being said, there's a lot of...
1802095	1806284	Xbox gut punch stories that have been happening over and over and over again.
1806605	1809451	And I realized another one that came up the week we were gone.
1809511	1811936	I'm sorry, I didn't put this on the show world, but I have to bring this up.
1811956	1814682	And Loki, I know you're going to know what I'm talking about the minute I start talking about it.
1815123	1821977	And that is the whole word that came out about that the Microsoft division is being forced to hit a 30% target.
1821957	1841046	And that potentially this is what is actually driving some of the Game Pass increases and some of the things we see and that, in fact, it may even be playing into some of the hardware increases and not just the tariffs as originally thought, which is extremely problematic if that's like...
1841026	1845153	There's this arbitrary 30% that they're trying to hit on this front.
1845173	1853626	And they've let us all believe that it's, you know, the tariffs, which, you know, I don't think you can say that's not to blame because you see it hitting PlayStation as well.
1853646	1862139	But there was an odd disconnect about it doesn't seem to be hitting PlayStation in the same volume or Nintendo even in the same volume that it's hitting Microsoft.
1862159	1864523	And now we might have some insight why.
1864543	1867067	And that is this whole that apparently there is this
1867047	1872601	Arbitrary 30% profit margin, which by the way, is not common for the industry.
1873042	1875508	Usually it's a 10 to 20% margin.
1875648	1883487	It's like-
1883467	1902977	I do not see Microsoft being a player in the hardware business in another year or two it is that dire with what's going on right now and I'm not saying that to be like an angry gamer I'm just saying real facts name a win for Microsoft in the last six months I'll wait
1906282	1909815	Now I'm sure there's going to be an Xbox fan out there that's like, this game or that game.
1909835	1914030	Okay, name a win that offsets the losses.
1914348	1918874	Name a W that offsets the L's that Microsoft has been taking.
1918894	1923780	And this whole 30% thing is just really not a good look.
1923800	1927625	The optics of this is really shitty.
1927645	1937858	And now to hear that Halo's going to PlayStation 5, I think there are so many people now that are just like, I never have to buy an Xbox again.
1938580	1967575	and perhaps there's a part I think Microsoft sort of has to figure out what do you want to be and I think we're hearing most of the business say they are ready to pivot to games like every screen is an Xbox and not so much have a focus on hardware but then you get these things out of nowhere that are like oh but we're working on the next generation of Xbox we're committed to the next generation of Xbox that's going to happen or you know we're going to release this really expensive game
1967555	1973164	You know, handheld with a partner that, you know, probably doesn't even run as well as a Steam Deck.
1973224	1982919	Like, you just, you find these weird ways that they're committing to hardware that are in conflict with that vision that is supposedly there.
1982939	1989630	So I think a lot of decision makers at Microsoft need to sit down and answer two key questions.
1990091	1992735	Number one, are we all aligned?
1993222	1999194	And number two, if we're not, who needs to get packing so we are?
1999214	2005726	Because I don't see how Microsoft gets out of this mess without making some serious changes at the top.
2005747	2010255	And I've kind of been hinting at this for a while, that Phil Spencer's time, I think, is about up.
2010275	2011618	And I...
2011919	2019933	Maybe two years ago I would have said, I hate to say, now I say, it's a logical conclusion.
2019993	2022236	It's not just, it really isn't.
2022256	2028086	Oh no, there's a whole, and you know, I don't think, the Phil Spencer was not the one that mandated that 30% margin either.
2028106	2033916	I don't remember who the, I can't remember the woman's name who's ahead of, I don't remember what she's ahead of.
2034377	2037162	Sarah, yeah.
2037643	2037943	Yeah.
2039746	2044133	None of them have had good takes on anything lately.
2045274	2052165	Because she's in charge of software, I actually think she has the least amount to worry about right now.
2052185	2054328	Because the wins are all in software right now.
2054368	2055930	That's where she's at.
2057813	2063321	Even then, it's not really that much of a win.
2063381	2067087	I haven't really been thinking too much about...
2067067	2074579	The games that Microsoft's necessarily releasing, but there hasn't been a whole ton that have been like, oh my god, like, I need to run out and go get this right now.
2074599	2078345	There's some that have been looking really good, but there's also games that, like, where's Fable?
2078726	2081290	I've been waiting for that for years now, like, where's Fable?
2081310	2087900	Like, we were talking about brand new Fable back in the Kinect days, like, that's how long ago it's been.
2088301	2090745	It's like, I don't know, it's...
2091113	2101674	Bobby and Chat, Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes live before us on Sunday nights at VOG, is saying some things about this in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, saying the Microsoft CFO mandated it.
2101694	2102596	That's not Sarah Bond.
2102616	2103598	That's somebody else.
2103618	2112075	But the CFO of Big Daddy Microsoft mandated the 30% profit margin, and the Xbox division, Phil and Sarah, have to do whatever they can to meet it.
2112055	2118168	It's because they're going all in on it.
2118248	2127448	They're going...
2127428	2135197	All in on AI over the main Microsoft area, which they're going to dump a ton of money into that, and that's going to flop.
2135558	2136920	So I can't wait to see that.
2137180	2149555	I understand a lot of companies are navigating this whole AI thing, but I think those that are going as all in as they are, as fast as they are, are going to quickly find that you get what you pay for.
2150581	2153666	and Microsoft may be one of the first to learn that.
2153906	2156170	I actually, and I'm kind of rooting for this to happen.
2156230	2159074	I hate to say it, but that's just where my head is at.
2159094	2168028	I really want Facebook to have disastrous financial outcomes because of everything they're doing.
2168048	2169771	I think Facebook as a company has been
2169751	2174679	It's been a shithole for years and a blight on the internet.
2174799	2179426	And so I would love to see this type of investment sort of backfire on them, to be quite honest.
2180548	2181790	So anyway.
2182030	2184995	Meta hasn't done anything exciting for a long time.
2185135	2186998	I mean, the only thing that you can say is remotely exciting.
2187018	2188060	Boomer memes.
2188080	2190924	If you're into misinformation, boomer memes.
2191085	2191525	Oh, my God.
2191565	2192687	Facebook's where it's at.
2192667	2198392	Well, I was going to say, like, their VR stuff was actually kind of neat.
2198492	2199513	The hardware was.
2199693	2201415	Software, eh, I don't know.
2201595	2206199	Like, where's my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas meta?
2206379	2213706	I thought you were tooling that to be, like, first off, why you would even port that to VR in the first place, no idea.
2213846	2217069	But, like, I thought they were working on that, and that certainly hasn't happened.
2217089	2219871	But, yeah, that was the only thing that was somewhat exciting.
2219891	2222033	Everything else is just, eh, whatever.
2222013	2224856	So several people in chat.
2224876	2229561	QuestBuster saying Facebook lost roughly 10% from their AI unit.
2229761	2229921	Sorry.
2230922	2235206	QuestBuster says Facebook lost roughly 10% in the past few days of their stock price.
2235567	2239250	Bobby says they laid off 600 from their AI units this week.
2239330	2242073	QuestBuster says Facebook is so behind right now.
2242233	2247198	SGO100Matt says it would be great if the American oligarchs got knocked down a few pegs.
2247218	2248760	That fucking part.
2248840	2250041	That fucking part.
2250161	2251202	That is what it really is.
2251222	2252003	It's not going to happen anytime soon.
2251983	2254347	No, but you... Here's the thing.
2254607	2256811	I second, third, fourth, and fifth, and sixth that.
2257011	2264763	Facebook could have leveraged AI to combat the massive amount of misinformation on the platform.
2265204	2269130	They could have leveraged... But they want the misinformation because more engagement, which means more ads.
2269150	2270452	So, you know, they don't care.
2270472	2272215	It's all about profit over ethics.
2272255	2273397	You are 100% correct.
2273897	2275560	At some point...
2275540	2290680	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2290660	2306121	and honestly at this point all I do is I cross post promotion yeah and anytime I find myself opening it at a muscle memory I have this add-on on my PC called FB Purity which forces the chronological meme without any of the fluff I used to use that
2306101	2322760	And the thing is, you really quickly realize, like, if I were to scroll my feed, meme, meme, politics, meme, meme, politics, meme, misinformation, quote, it's just, there's literally, like, what the fuck ever happened to cat pics and lunch?
2325305	2333617	The last time that I used Facebook was specifically to post a GoFundMe.
2333637	2345433	That being said, if I were to not use Facebook, a certain group of people that I know would have no idea what shows I'm ever hosting locally.
2345674	2348237	I use it for promotion.
2348257	2350981	I don't type any personal insights on it anymore.
2351482	2351582	Okay.
2351849	2356015	I'm getting the free ads from it.
2356035	2358679	That's about it.
2358980	2361103	That's all it's worth at this point to me.
2361123	2363166	So anyway, I don't know.
2363186	2366311	We got on a tangent from Microsoft to Facebook.
2366331	2372601	But yeah, it does feel like a lot of that big tech bubble is going to burst.
2372621	2377248	And I'm like, how much of that is realistic thinking and how much of that is wishful thinking?
2377709	2380573	Because I will admit, both are coming into play.
2380655	2382771	I think a lot of it is the perspective.
2382811	2385552	You look at, for example...
2386291	2390277	Sora, like what is that platform even?
2390477	2400491	It is just a platform that people use AI to generate short videos of essentially trash, garbage stuff.
2400511	2402273	It's a misinformation factory.
2402854	2405258	You are literally creating things that aren't real on it.
2405558	2406199	Right, right, right.
2406279	2408122	And so what's the purpose of it though?
2408182	2411506	Like how does that make that company money?
2411566	2412808	How does that make open AI money?
2413249	2414931	Oh, well, they want to serve ads.
2416058	2435755	Thank you for watching!
2435735	2438298	It's not a viable company.
2438318	2440501	It's not doing anything revolutionary.
2440681	2444847	Why should we allow you to steal all of this IP?
2445387	2453538	Just straight up, both them, Meta, everybody, just steal all the things just to generate slop.
2454979	2456241	There's no reason for it.
2457689	2461214	All right, anyway, we went down a rabbit hole, but that's fine.
2461415	2462476	We have feelings.
2462516	2467164	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week, Xbox or otherwise.
2467785	2470068	DarkSakura, I have a feeling you are team otherwise.
2470589	2471270	How was your gaming week?
2471470	2482227	Yeah, well, apart from what I had already said for TwitchCon, I started Portal 2 last night as my retro game, which I feel kind of dirty calling it a retro game, but I literally have not played it in like 10 years.
2482567	2483629	It is, yeah.
2483727	2486270	So I played that.
2486811	2491276	I'm like up at puzzle 10 in the underground section.
2492177	2495301	So I got GLaDOS again, because she's a potato.
2498665	2502190	I am still playing Dead by Daylight.
2502650	2507576	I got all the way through the event, finally.
2508177	2509819	My pig is P92.
2510997	2531892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2532766	2550302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2551953	2566470	Even though I really want to get through the DLC that I'm on before the new DLC comes out, which I have to see Fire and Ash first and then play the DLC.
2569234	2573979	I'm frustrated by it because I do not want to play as Solek.
2574540	2576222	I mean, he's a cool character, don't get me wrong.
2576603	2581909	The whole reason I play Frontiers of Pandora is to play my character that I have...
2581889	2584732	Benwith from the beginning of the fucking game.
2585873	2586193	You know?
2586674	2588576	Thanks, Ubisoft.
2588596	2593501	I'm just hoping that if I get through the story part of it, then I can go back to playing my character.
2596043	2599427	But I'm not super invested in Sleek.
2599447	2600328	I mean, he's a cool guy.
2600408	2600928	Cool character.
2601148	2604071	Read the comics.
2605272	2606213	I prefer my character.
2606414	2607795	That's why I play the damn game.
2608940	2612305	I am less invested in playing a male character.
2613546	2614127	Within reason.
2617051	2618192	Unless it's Richter Belmont.
2620295	2620616	Even.
2621156	2622518	I'll play Maria, actually.
2623199	2623460	Fine.
2624000	2627725	I'm sorry, if I'm playing Rondo, the game is freaking easy mode when you play Maria.
2629147	2631230	Plus she has that little la la la la la la la.
2632932	2635676	Anything else for your game of the week?
2635696	2635876	No.
2636457	2637899	Then we'll go over to Loki.
2638019	2638660	How was your game of the week?
2639315	2652381	I mainly was working on Minecraft stuff, trying to get a modded... Still working on a modded series and trying to get the seed and the mods set up for that.
2652401	2654425	So I think I've gotten that.
2654505	2657070	I've got a seed I like and...
2657050	2661917	I've been working on trying to figure out how to get that all set up and started and stuff.
2662658	2663399	So there was that.
2664180	2672110	Today I played through a Minecraft event that was Clix with InsideMC.
2672150	2678579	They did an event with Clix Games that was kind of like MCC, so it's a bunch of different events.
2678699	2680662	Our team actually ended up...
2680642	2692342	Number one for points, and then we came in second for... Because basically the top two teams go to a final match where you fight each other, and then whoever wins that actually wins the whole thing.
2692382	2694866	So we didn't win, but we came in first points-wise.
2694886	2696709	But it was a lot of fun.
2696729	2696930	Nice.
2697170	2702619	And we raised money for the Macmillan Cancer Fund Society.
2702699	2704583	I can't remember what it was.
2704743	2704843	Yeah.
2705397	2706779	Support, Cancer Support.
2708061	2713149	And it was, I think, 1,900 pounds they raised.
2713170	2715653	So it's not bad.
2715854	2721583	And then I played this game that's behind me, which is Once Upon a Katamari.
2721563	2726011	and I love me some Katamari, except I have some issues with this game.
2726492	2733444	And the reason for that is like, OK, so Katamari, when we first played, it was on a PlayStation two.
2733645	2736670	It was basically, you know, not HD.
2736650	2754574	Thanks for watching!
2754554	2759403	The problem is these games have been getting more and more elaborate as far as like the visuals go.
2759924	2770403	And so playing this game, there's many times where the king of the cosmos will be sitting there talking to you and it blocks the entire center third of the screen.
2770383	2799512	and so it's becoming now a problem with even though my screen resolution is going up these UI inner pieces are staying the same size it is taking up a massive amount of screen real estate and it is irritating because I cannot see what I'm doing in this game because there's too much UI that's unnecessary in there I think a good description I saw in the Steam reviews was the game lacks confidence in itself
2799492	2820133	and the reason they say that is because they're not confident in their soundtrack because they're selling the old soundtracks as DLC they're not confident that the players will be able to learn the controls from the tutorial so there's constant control prompts on the screen at all times they're not confident in
2820113	2848804	just going back to these levels again for replayability to like try to up your score so they hide these crowns in there which is fine that they have them but there's a lot of unnecessary menus there's a lot of unnecessary like hub worlds and stuff a lot of forcing you through like all these menus and customization like I don't care about customizing the Prince of the Cosmos I don't literally on like you can't really see it on the screen behind me right now but literally on that like the Prince is like
2848784	2870944	maybe five pixels tall like you cannot see any sort of customization that you are doing on on your prints okay so in chat Bobby is saying that the king would interrupt on the PlayStation 2 game and it's a lot more to everything you're saying you could always pick from his cousins in the PS2 game too so yeah you can do that maybe not customize but it's you know changing it up you can
2870924	2871825	You can do both.
2873307	2875470	But he's constantly talking to you.
2875831	2878194	He's doing it right now in this video that's behind me.
2878234	2881458	He's just constantly talking and blocking a good portion of the screen.
2881478	2882840	Yeah, I saw some crown icons.
2883881	2892713	These icons are coming right up over your... Yeah, there's icons and then there's power-ups that you get now, which also sit above your player as...
2892693	2895518	So UI design is really bad.
2895538	2903032	And then on top of that, they have these unnecessary hub worlds that you go select your levels from.
2903493	2905297	It just feels really unnecessary.
2905337	2907300	The other games did it so much better.
2907761	2910887	I just want to play a game where I'm rolling a Katamari around...
2910867	2917073	We start off in a room and then, you know, at the very end of the game, we're rolling up the whole universe or whatever the case may be.
2917374	2918535	Like, that's all I want.
2918555	2919536	Like, I want it simple.
2919576	2923260	I don't need all this, like, fluff and pizzazz and everything.
2924381	2928906	So it is a little annoying that they have, like, all this stuff in the way.
2928926	2932770	And yeah, this is another thing where they do, like, a cutscene and it has a bunch of stuff in here.
2932790	2935533	It's like, is this really necessary?
2935553	2935913	But...
2937091	2938053	It's a minor gripe.
2938153	2939435	I mean, it's still an okay game.
2939495	2941558	They have a really great soundtrack.
2941778	2945985	It looks super crisp now with the new graphics and everything, so I really do like that.
2946165	2950212	But it also feels like it's just so sluggish to move around.
2950612	2952856	Like, it really is a slog sometimes.
2953377	2959727	It doesn't quite feel as sharp or tight as I remember it was on the other consoles, but I don't know.
2960127	2960568	Whatever.
2961189	2961850	Um...
2962420	2965447	That's just my gripes on it, but there are other people that agree with it, at least.
2965628	2966249	How much was it?
2966309	2967151	Was it a $70?
2967572	2969838	Or is it still leaning into budget stuff?
2969878	2971041	Okay, so it's more like a $40, $50?
2971061	2972224	I don't remember exactly.
2972585	2977777	Yeah, it's not super expensive, but it's... Bobby says $40.
2977797	2978659	$40.
2978980	2979180	Okay.
2979662	2980243	That's not bad.
2982097	2984803	Yeah, it's definitely worth $40 or get it on sale.
2985605	2986627	It's a fun game.
2986707	2989152	It's just there's like, I just think there's a lot.
2989192	2993742	All they really need to do to fix it is just like, hey, can you like have some options?
2993822	2995506	A UI percentage scaler.
2995666	2998452	Like take all UI elements and scale them down 50%.
2998432	3005102	Yeah, it didn't auto-detect my hardware or anything, and so when I started the game, I was in a super tiny window.
3005122	3007906	It was like 720p, just in the center of my screen.
3007926	3009348	I'm like, what's going on here?
3009368	3013053	I had to go and adjust everything, because a default is a really stupid thing.
3013254	3017740	But they just have a UI scale or something like that that you can adjust.
3017760	3021626	That would be so much better, or just an option like, hey, can I stop getting reminders for how to control it?
3021646	3022868	Final Fantasy XIV has that, and I love it.
3023308	3025031	Final Fantasy XIV has the UI percentage.
3025051	3026633	It's great.
3026613	3036047	basic UI stuff like just quality of life things that they could have just added into it and it would be so simple and make it so much better but I don't know.
3036868	3037670	It's fine.
3037690	3038571	It's still fun to play.
3038791	3045381	It's just minor annoyances that would make what would be like it's a good game to a great game I guess.
3046880	3049804	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week.
3050025	3055813	Actually, considering the fact that I was gone most of the week, I actually had a very active gaming week.
3055833	3058717	So, still playing some of the old standbys, Diablo 4.
3058917	3064546	I feel like I'm going to finish all the Battle Pass quests this season, or whatever they call it, the season journey.
3064566	3066068	It's not really Battle Pass, it's the season journey.
3066088	3070855	I feel like I'm going to finish it this season with my build, which I haven't done in a long time, so that's kind of exciting.
3070895	3072157	I've been leaning into that.
3072177	3075081	I played Final Fantasy XIV for the first time in a bit.
3075121	3076583	I got a notice that my
3076563	3078705	House was going to get destroyed if I don't log in.
3078745	3083070	I was like, all right, I should log in and play and like check out some of the things they've done in the recent patches.
3083090	3084852	And so I checked out their new deep dungeon.
3084932	3089077	I played a little bit of that, that they just added the most recent patch that supports up to level 100.
3089497	3090498	So I was playing a little bit of that.
3090879	3092200	And then I was playing some new stuff.
3092220	3096905	So I actually checked out Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D remake.
3097586	3100309	I was really excited to check that out because admittedly,
3100289	3127123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3127508	3146344	Reminds me nothing of the original Dragon Warrior.
3146324	3165919	Quest or Dragon Warrior 1 has aged significantly and so of course they've got to do a lot graphically to it they're going to do some quality of life things like you don't need torches and dungeons anymore it's just an automatic thing because it goes with the art style but they really changed the story like a lot I'm talking like Final Fantasy 7 remake a lot
3165899	3166700	It's not bad.
3167181	3171688	It's just like, oh, OK, I didn't realize this is what it's going to be.
3171708	3175715	So I feel like there's a lot I still can't really evaluate until I beat it.
3175795	3186051	But I will just say this is just like a new Dragon Quest game that in theory has some threads that are in common with the original game.
3186031	3187732	But now I understand.
3188093	3189694	I understand their big picture now.
3189734	3201204	Maybe it was obvious to some of you that are bigger and longer Dragon Quest fans than I. But it's very obvious that they released three first because chronologically it's first.
3201685	3209191	And now they're releasing one and two to basically kind of, I guess, retcon the original trilogy as a chronological trilogy.
3209211	3214536	Because a lot of the changes they've made in one are to support three first.
3214516	3231732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3231712	3254732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3254712	3279741	Dragon Quest 1, Dragon Quest 2, Dragon Quest 3
3279721	3288646	Like fairies and characters that have threads to three, but they weren't in the original Nintendo version of the game.
3288787	3293340	So I would say it's very akin to the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
3293360	3295165	It's got some elements.
3295145	3296127	of the original story.
3296167	3301077	Actually, I would say the Final Fantasy VII remake actually had more threads than this does from where I'm sitting.
3301097	3302419	But again, not bad.
3302439	3303301	I'm enjoying my time.
3303421	3304423	I do intend to beat it.
3304604	3307229	I do think it's a lot of fun to go through.
3307249	3313341	They've put in a lot of collectible stuff like mini medals and the shiny spots on the map and the hidden layers and things like that.
3313541	3317068	They've given you a lot to do and explore to sort of beef up what
3317048	3342138	It's a new Dragon Quest game that has some threads to the original trilogy.
3342238	3343680	That's where I'm at.
3343660	3347210	Uh, then I also bought the Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection.
3347250	3349938	I bought both of those in the same day because they both came out when I was gone.
3350319	3352705	I have not played as much of the Legacy Collection.
3352745	3358682	So this is the Digital Eclipse, who does the Gold Master Series, like the Karateka, you know, and the, um...
3358662	3361525	The Tetris ones they did recently.
3361845	3374738	This is their Mortal Kombat, but it's not technically a gold master because per Blue Sky replies, a gold master game is documentary first and the games are there as a nice to have.
3375299	3383607	The collection is a games first, documentary second, even though I don't know from where I'm sitting, I get more excited about the documentary.
3383587	3408565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3408545	3415134	or somebody that I know is about as good at Mortal Kombat as I am, I would do that.
3415154	3418659	But I don't want to play against all the elite people online.
3419060	3420122	It's going to be a waste of my time.
3420542	3422064	But I've been playing the single player.
3422245	3432980	I was playing Mortal Kombat 2 Arcade and I kind of liked that if I missed a fatality, I could just rewind and you can put the moves up on the screen and so I can practice and do it that way.
3433381	3436705	And I feel like that'll help me next time I actually play the game in an arcade again.
3436725	3437927	Because I will...
3437907	3442775	The muscle memory I have for Katana's fatality, block, block, block, block, block, block, high kick.
3443176	3443776	I just know.
3443797	3445499	I just have that memorized.
3445519	3446240	I go to a hard game.
3446521	3449906	If I get the finishing screen, block, block, block, high kick, chop off the head with a fan.
3450527	3451008	I know that.
3451309	3453091	But I don't know any of the other moves.
3453172	3455676	I couldn't even remember all of Katana's moves.
3455936	3458380	So having them on the screen has actually been very nice.
3458360	3461102	Um, so yeah, there's, there's parts of that.
3461122	3469710	I like, I like that they have some of the more obscure Mortal Kombat titles like the Game Boy one and the PlayStation spinoff games, even if none of them are particularly good.
3470531	3477077	I think sometimes a collection is not necessarily about having all of the good games, but having a complete retrospective.
3477437	3479599	And this seems to do a pretty good job from one to four.
3479719	3488367	So I'm enjoying it so far, but more to come once I finished the documentary, because I am noticing something pretty big missing from the documentary.
3488347	3509072	and DarkSakura.com.
3509052	3511495	Today, October 31st, is The Wall.
3512076	3512957	I am resting.
3512977	3513978	I'm not doing anything.
3514439	3522710	Because the next day, yes, last night, I knew I had tickets to go see, I keep wanting to say Dear Friends, but that's not what they call it.
3522730	3523591	I haven't called it that in years.
3523671	3529158	Distant Worlds, the Final Fantasy Symphony, happened to be here in Sacramento for the very first time.
3530040	3538010	So I went, because every other time I've seen it, I've driven to San Francisco, LA, when I went to the very, very first one, or even, I think there might have been one in San Jose that I saw.
3538030	3538671	So I went to San Francisco, LA,
3538651	3541575	So this is the very first time it was in Sacramento.
3541595	3542877	So I went to Distant Worlds.
3542917	3544700	I went with Alan and we took our friend Dan.
3544740	3546562	It's like a late birthday present.
3546582	3548145	And it was a good show.
3548265	3552130	I would say the first half was really like some of the best.
3552211	3555055	The mix of music they played was like some of the best.
3555135	3561664	And it's because now they have intentionally added a ton of 14 and 16 into it.
3561684	3567072	So I will say if you're going to see the show this year and you've seen it before, you can count on the fact –
3567052	3568614	They're going to play Zanarkand.
3568674	3570216	They're going to play One Wing Angel.
3570336	3571978	They're going to play something from Nine.
3572399	3575863	And they're going to play Liberty Fatale.
3575883	3578607	They're always open with eights opening movie thing.
3579007	3582532	So there's some standards they are simply going to play every time.
3583113	3591123	But this time they played four songs from Final Fantasy XIV and they played four songs from Final Fantasy XVI in the second half, which ate up a lot.
3591143	3594848	When you consider it's a night at the symphony and they're playing... There's maybe...
3595537	3623451	I want to say maybe 15 songs tops they play all night so that was a big chunk of the program and the 14 part was really obviously I love 14 it was really cool to hear that they had the original vocalist that sang Flow and I can't remember the name of the Crystarium song in the moment but it's the really good ballad that goes with and she was the highlight of any time I have been to see Distant Worlds which is probably like four or five now
3623431	3627156	Having her there actually singing live, she was fucking incredible.
3627196	3628618	Amanda Aiken's her name.
3628638	3631121	She is incredible.
3631481	3634986	And so to hear her sing the 14 songs live was great.
3635006	3637849	And that was really a highlight and really worth the price of admission.
3638370	3639291	I'm going to be honest.
3639912	3642455	Not everyone is going to like what I'm about to say.
3642475	3643536	This is my opinion.
3643696	3646160	You can take it or you can leave it.
3646180	3648122	The Final Fantasy XVI stuff...
3650515	3656684	It just reminded me how really woefully mediocre 16's soundtrack is in the grand scheme of things.
3656704	3660068	And it does pay me to say, I love Soken.
3660088	3661570	I love what he's done for 14.
3662051	3672666	I just think 16's soundtrack was not, it doesn't have as many standouts as even like 15, to be quite honest, or some of the ones that came before it.
3672686	3673787	It does have some bangers.
3674188	3675209	I love the prelude.
3675530	3676691	The Titan theme is great.
3676852	3678514	Neither of those were played.
3678747	3689517	but they did have Amanda come back out because I didn't even realize Amanda does sing the ballad at the end of 16 but that's also the
3691133	3697058	The most infuriating part of that game to me is the love theme, okay?
3697139	3699621	Is the most infuriating part of 16 to me.
3699641	3701663	It was completely out of place in my opinion.
3701783	3709810	I've gone into this before and we're way past the spoiler limit at this point, but I cannot stand the love story with Clive and Jill in that game.
3709830	3713434	I think it feels extremely shoehorned into me.
3713934	3718238	And so that by nature, that song that goes with that whole thing
3718775	3742352	is just like she I can recognize and say she did a very lovely job performing it was a great performance and I can sit here and go I just don't like this the soundtrack does not the same now on the other hand I will tell me when they get Angela Aki I will be fair and say this I feel like they might have had her at more friends years ago years ago like 2006 or whenever I saw it at E3 um
3742332	3757438	but I will say Alan and Dan don't know 16 as well so that whole segment was like we don't know these songs but Alan was like that first song was really good and I was like I couldn't even tell you what the name of it was
3759308	3761430	It's the song when Ifrit and Phoenix are fighting.
3761670	3762111	It's that.
3763152	3763472	But yeah.
3763853	3766295	Bobby Blackwell says Ben Starr is now sad.
3766315	3768197	They actually used his voiceover.
3768217	3772741	It's the only dialogue from those games I've heard in that performance.
3773082	3777006	They do have Ben Starr's big accept the truth moment.
3777026	3778007	Come to me, Ifrit!
3778027	3778988	Except they cut that part out.
3779328	3780489	But everything leading up to it.
3781910	3784333	Because they started playing that song with Ifrit.
3784353	3785574	It was one of the songs they played.
3785694	3787476	So...
3788063	3812923	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3812903	3820153	Plus, the one song they did play from 14 twice, so I heard it last year and heard it again, is the Beef Soft Tacos song.
3820413	3823217	Which, if you don't know what song that is, it's the end singer.
3823757	3827042	It's the very last boss fight of Heavensward.
3827222	3831908	So you got to do the whole choir, and they're singing lyrics that sound like...
3831888	3836274	Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos Supreme.
3836595	3838197	That's what the lyrics sound like.
3838598	3844446	And so to like, like, I'm sitting there in my seat and I know they're saying whatever it is in Latin or other languages.
3844486	3845408	I'm just sitting there.
3845428	3849053	All I hear in my head is Beef Soft Tacos, the Beef Soft Tacos.
3850197	3854109	I was like, and I was telling Alan, I'm like, they played the Beef Soft Tacos song.
3854149	3856196	He's looking at me like, you're a fucking freak.
3856256	3857580	And he's right.
3857600	3857901	All right.
3858322	3859425	Anyway, that was my gaming week.
3859466	3859947	Busy, busy.
3860549	3862836	Let's get into some more gaming news.
3862936	3863498	Loki.
3864473	3864874	All right.
3866037	3869063	Well, we can go back and talk about some more Xbox stuff.
3869083	3874315	So their revenue, as we mentioned, is not doing well.
3874335	3879467	And this is where that whole 30% requirement is coming from.
3880008	3883917	Basically saying, you know, that they have...
3885078	3896404	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3896553	3919337	them wanting to charge $80 for all of the games that come out all that type of stuff because yeah right now they are working on increasing AI capacity by 80% this year that's where all the money at Microsoft is going is into that type of stuff and co-pilot and putting AI into Microsoft Teams and Calculator or whatever
3919317	3920238	Notepad.
3920939	3922281	Notepad has AI now.
3922301	3930212	Oh, is this why Copilot, the equivalent of the 2025 equivalent, or Bobby says in chat, this mandate's actually from 2023 and we're just finding out about it.
3930573	3930953	Fine.
3931254	3935520	The 2023 equivalent of Clippy is now showing up in Copilot.
3935540	3937242	But it's worse because they have like
3937222	3938684	Other thing, it's not even Clippy.
3938724	3939766	It's like something else.
3940026	3945074	It's like, I don't want to talk to that or do anything with that.
3945094	3946996	But yeah, it's a lot of that stuff.
3947036	3950562	That's also why you're seeing more employee cuts.
3950582	3953686	You're seeing games be canceled, like Perfect Dark.
3955209	3956130	You know, that type of stuff.
3956310	3959635	It's all because of these mandates to...
3959783	3963852	Make Lang go up.
3965075	3966639	Praise the shareholders.
3967120	3969064	That type of stuff.
3970929	3972392	Yeah, that's kind of annoying.
3973216	3981227	Well, if AI can't feed people this month, I think there's going to be a lot of people who don't give a flying fuck about what Copilot can do for them.
3982349	3985112	But that's the topic for another show.
3986594	3991461	But interesting that Microsoft, it's not...
3991441	4019963	and DarkSakura.
4020517	4035150	you know maybe not making up what they could there but definitely going multi-platform will help with that but once again that also makes it more of a gamble when it comes to the next piece of hardware because it's like well
4036177	4065677	I don't need to buy a Microsoft console because I can just play your games when they come to PC or I can play Halo on my Playstation now exactly so it's like so that's really gonna eat into the next Microsoft console unless this console's like really doing something different I think if it's just like yeah the graphics are slightly better no it's gonna be AI stuff is gonna be what they push in the next console 100% 100%
4067210	4070514	Well, cool, I guess.
4070654	4071055	I don't know.
4071555	4072016	We'll see.
4072977	4079104	Speaking of which, well, you know, and I think, I think too, and this next story is really going to underscore this.
4079565	4082528	Like, AI has always been around in video games.
4082548	4084951	You would expect video games to have AI.
4085312	4087014	This might shock you that I'm going to say this.
4087114	4088876	Video games ought to have AI.
4089377	4093922	If you're going to have player versus environment or player, you know, your game has to have AI.
4094202	4097166	We've had AI since the era of the Atari 2600.
4097146	4100430	It's this generative and what it really is.
4100571	4102814	I've given this a lot of thought.
4102894	4104055	What's my red line?
4104155	4105798	What is it about AI that I don't like?
4105958	4109162	Sure, I'll use AI as an idea generator.
4109522	4111445	I'll use AI for things here.
4111966	4115350	But where I don't like it is when it starts to replace art.
4115370	4115931	It's not...
4115911	4120500	Yeah, it's not even necessarily, it's just the terminology gets changed.
4120520	4122584	It's not artificial intelligence.
4122604	4136451	I mean, artificial intelligence in the sense that I've coded some rules that this thing follows, that something follows, given environmental circumstances or a random...
4136431	4158034	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4158757	4164028	I mean, yeah, sometimes it may summarize stuff, but we're not to a point where we can trust that that is correct.
4164269	4169720	It is most of the time going to be wrong, and sometimes it can't even do the simplest of things.
4170021	4171905	So it's just, yeah.
4172206	4177974	Well, leading into this story about a brand new release that came out this week that apparently a lot of people are playing on Steam.
4178835	4184804	This is a looter shooter, so it's not really... I mean, once in a while I get into these games, but this one hasn't really been on my radar.
4185204	4188949	But I am seeing some friends online that are enjoying Ark Raiders.
4188969	4194878	And there's a lot of discourse, trademark patent pending, around the use of AI in Ark Raiders.
4195418	4196560	So...
4196540	4200508	It does have an AI generated content disclosure on the Steam page.
4200888	4207802	And the disclosure says that during the development process, we may use procedural and AI based tools to assist with content creation.
4207822	4213553	In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.
4213533	4222603	and the design director, Virgil Watkins, when being interviewed by PC Games N said, Arc Raiders in no way uses generative AI whatsoever.
4222984	4230172	And in an interview with Eurogamer, Stefan Strandberg, CCO said, the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI.
4230813	4243287	But it turns out the details are a little like, so, okay, it's not using like language generation, but what is happening is that some of it is voice actors.
4243267	4264374	So apparently the text to speech is not all voice actor, meaning it is in the voice actor contract that we use AI for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like the ping system, where it says every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions.
4264855	4271383	That's how we get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game.
4271363	4283140	and that's the interesting sort of muddy waters now we're in because they're claiming we don't want a voice actor to have to come in and name the, you know, thousand things that are in the game.
4283160	4287326	But, you know, again, some of us that sort of really appreciate... Why does it need to do that?
4287346	4287706	Exactly.
4288187	4288808	Exactly.
4288828	4290430	Why does it need to do that?
4290450	4295618	Then make it a very obviously robotic type of voice or something.
4295638	4296058	I don't know.
4296259	4298141	I don't love this.
4298402	4300645	I feel like this is trying to be like...
4301401	4307811	We're not really screwing over the voice actors, but we're mandating that they allow us to use their voice to generate stuff in the game.
4307831	4311357	There's just so many lines we'd have to pay them for, and we don't want to do that.
4311377	4315924	Is that not against the part of the agreement with SAG-AFTRA?
4316105	4317587	Not when your game is made in Sweden.
4319423	4322070	So that's and that's the loophole.
4322651	4327182	So yeah, so just something to consider with the game.
4327744	4333177	I mean, you know, if the voice actor is getting compensated for it, I don't know.
4333358	4337027	I just it's it's a slippery slope.
4337142	4352282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4352262	4360056	Also, apparently AI tools were used to create a 3D model of the game from a YouTube video.
4360076	4363983	It was more of a research project, but not something that they're using in the game now.
4364584	4368571	I think AI as a play field is whatever.
4368651	4372498	It's fine, but it's interesting.
4373238	4379488	We're going to be seeing more about this and a lot of companies trying to figure out the ethical use of AI over the coming years.
4379648	4385597	Because some of them are completely signed in onto... This is a wasteland.
4385617	4386939	We're going to use it for whatever we want.
4387340	4390385	I think there's other companies that are really trying to figure out how do we ethically use this?
4391266	4394691	And it'll be interesting to see how that works.
4395272	4395853	So...
4396458	4396818	All right.
4398400	4399602	Some other comments and chat on this.
4399662	4400423	It's very interesting.
4401725	4404648	Bobby is pointing out the SAG-AFTRA thing only applies in the U.S.
4404769	4408213	It's why a lot of movies are moving production to the U.K.
4408233	4411277	So, you know, we need to get some worldwide lockdown on this.
4411337	4416604	QuestBuster says, as a note, they used AI tools in the finals for some of the announcer voice lines.
4416624	4423292	They recorded with real actors and then used AI to generate contextual audio, which they appear to have continued with ARC.
4423272	4449617	Bobby says, I think in this case, they're specifically scripting what the AI voice is saying, unlike Fortnite.
4449817	4452220	We'll see what continues to develop.
4452961	4456125	Anyway, pleasant little announcement from earlier this week.
4456145	4456646	DarkSakura.
4458348	4459289	Yes.
4459309	4460811	Animal Crossing.
4460951	4465377	Did I not say that it would take something along the lines of a new Animal Crossing to make me get a Switch 2?
4466799	4469042	Well, it's not a new Animal Crossing.
4469062	4470964	Let me finish.
4472227	4472648	Please.
4473889	4485182	So I said something like, and I said that very specifically, because Animal Crossing New Horizons 3.0 update is coming out and there is a Switch 2 edition on the way.
4485203	4497357	This is free for any New Horizons players, whichever version that you have, with a lot of new content, although some is very specifically Switch 2 related.
4497337	4501542	So this will be out on January 15th, 2026.
4502643	4504165	Both versions available the same day.
4505767	4516980	So you are going to be getting things like Resetti's Reset Service, the Katten's Resort Hotel, so they're bringing the entire Kappa family.
4517921	4523428	And you get to decorate hotel rooms kind of like it was Happy Home Designer.
4524117	4534397	which I think is awesome and you can invite people via amiibo cards to come and stay in your hotel I think indefinitely
4536689	4539315	I'm going to be getting to the rest of this.
4540417	4546250	The Switch 2 upgrade pack is not free.
4546270	4548155	That is the one that's about $5.
4548195	4554208	The one I was referring to that's free is the Switch version which is the one I'm focusing on first.
4555336	4582120	but you also are getting upgraded storage your storage goes up to I believe 9,000 items you have the dream world and the slumber islands which you can just basically build infinite extra islands so there you go you get three it's not infinite three how about let me do the thing myself thank you um
4584023	4586226	There are Lego items.
4586246	4590232	There are new Zelda items, new Amiibo.
4590252	4592456	There's Splatoon items.
4592476	4597103	There's NES and Game Boy games, different consoles, retro toys.
4598164	4605175	And with the Dream Island, as I was getting to, they're not permanent.
4605235	4606156	You can start over.
4606257	4609862	You can do as many different ones as you want to, up to three.
4611260	4614786	I'm pretty excited about the Katten Hotel.
4615607	4616588	I'm looking forward to that.
4619052	4629589	And then though for Switch 2, there of course is going to be an immediate graphic improvement.
4629569	4641303	There's going to be 12-player multiplayer, the megaphone item, mouse controls with the Joy-Con, and again, like I said, improved resolution.
4642284	4651915	I'm also kind of excited that we're getting the systems in the words section.
4652587	4679725	The video game system is available in the store Like with the NES you get Clu Clu and Ice Climbers And Dr. Mario for Game Boy It even is specifying that you have a Famicom Disk System An NES, a Super Famicom There's the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine, the Love Tester All of those are back So that's pretty cool
4682928	4688234	I'm with Artisuya in chat who says some of the in-game Nintendo merch is definitely tempting me to come back.
4688254	4688794	That's where I'm at.
4688814	4696203	Like I realize that the NES stuff and all the stuff they're putting in are bridges to the online console service.
4696463	4698545	Like I understand that that is like an element.
4699086	4706674	I still love – like I'm fine with them leveraging that because I feel like to me that's Animal Crossing kind of going back –
4706654	4708658	To its roots, in a way.
4708678	4711463	And what drew me into Animal Crossing in the first place.
4711483	4713025	So that's really exciting to me.
4713045	4716852	And then I think all the Lego and the Zelda stuff is just a bonus.
4717313	4722001	And to be quite honest, I didn't really bother with Animal Crossing when the 2.0 version came out.
4722062	4724526	I never bothered with it.
4724546	4729074	So I'm excited to have a reason to revisit.
4729395	4731278	Although...
4731258	4761265	I'm a little sad it's not a new game and I feel like this is a time buyer for an inevitable new game but then again Mario Kart we got a shit ton of tracks from Mario Kart 8 and we didn't get Mario Kart World until a little while later it wasn't that long of a wait for Mario Kart World so I shouldn't jump to that conclusion it's tempting to do but I guess maybe with Mario Kart there could
4761245	4788147	You know, be that kind of precedent that they can turn around and do a new Animal Crossing real fast But it sounds like there's enough meat in this Especially because, to be honest, I didn't see the full trailer So a lot of this stuff Jamie's saying, I'm like, oh, I didn't know there was all this other stuff that's going in it too I just heard about that I watched the whole trailer I'm just like, oh, this sounds like there's going to be enough meat here That it's going to make the game worth revisiting Because I have not played it since 1.0
4788397	4812042	and there's also if you don't have some of the amiibos you will get special visitors showing up like Minero and Tulen they can be random visitors that show up at the campsite so you do have that and I don't know what anyone's saying about this ripping off of
4812022	4820303	The Hello Kitty thing, because this has been kind of a thing with Animal Crossing, the ability to decorate the rooms and have people visit.
4820323	4822428	This is just an expansion of the campsite.
4824192	4828022	Or it's also a little bit more like Tortimer's Island, come to think of it.
4828222	4837516	I actually think the 12 people multiplayer is really fascinating too, because I think about my friends that did like, and I thought it, I honest to God thought it was limited to four.
4837656	4840400	They must have upped it to eight in 2.0 and I just missed it.
4840420	4841181	It wasn't on my radar.
4842363	4847310	So, but I had friends that did like an online survivor thing in Animal Crossing.
4847330	4851917	And now I'm just thinking about, oh my God, they actually can have a decent sized tribe now if 12 people can.
4851897	4852740	Do that.
4853021	4854446	I'm like, that's going to be so fun.
4855149	4857838	Yeah, and with the little cameras and the people.
4857979	4860367	I think that's going to be actually super fun.
4860387	4862515	So, yeah, it's...
4863187	4866531	I think it's... I'm glad the game gets a little bit of a renaissance.
4866591	4878607	Nintendo has these very interesting ways of just bringing these old-ass games... It's not even old, but just... Maybe because so many games in this day and age feel like they come and go in six months.
4879107	4881190	There's very few games that stay.
4881671	4882832	What's that?
4882812	4884614	I said it was from the before time.
4884974	4886535	Well, yeah, with the whole COVID thing.
4886816	4897926	You know, I definitely, Bobby talked about a very interesting sort of, I don't know if you'd call it like a Pavlov association or something, but basically that like Animal Crossing kind of takes him back to a similar mental state from COVID.
4898467	4900849	And it's kind of one of those, I can see that.
4901029	4907495	I can see where like Animal Crossing could be kind of like triggering in a way of that sort of time and era.
4907535	4909197	It just kind of depends what you associate with it.
4909597	4909697	Yeah.
4909677	4934976	I still wish there's like some stuff though that like it's like once again going back to quality of life discussions with some of these games like one of the things that's bugged me the most about this most recent Animal Crossing is the the first user on your Switch console that started the game is now in charge of the island and in this case my youngest son who doesn't play the game anymore is
4934956	4938962	It is annoying to have to log into his account to do certain things.
4939002	4946134	You should have an option in the game to change which user is in primary control of your island.
4946274	4951663	It is stupid that it is locked down permanently forever to one user.
4951763	4954167	Why can't they just add that to the game to fix that?
4954287	4955669	It would just be so much easier.
4956811	4959495	It's awesome for me because I don't want Dan to do crap to my island.
4962563	4967372	Well, that's your option, but it should be the option to be able to correct that as well.
4967432	4977210	It's weird quality of life stuff that they have, and also a lot of the stuff that they're adding, it's nice that there is some new things, but it feels like it's a retread of the whole paid DLC.
4977350	4986327	It's just decorating rooms, a little bit lesser to an extent because you're not doing the exterior as well, but it kind of feels like the same thing.
4986307	4989430	That's only if you bother getting it for Switch, too.
4989550	4992694	If you're just playing the Switch version, no charge at all.
4995497	4997018	Yeah, that's kind of interesting.
4997038	4999962	The DLC, though, I thought the DLC was paid.
5000863	5001083	No.
5001683	5002164	No, no, no.
5002324	5003085	This is all free.
5003926	5009732	No, Happy Home Designer, no, no, that's part of the thing.
5011417	5017085	According to what the trailer said and according to what I'm reading here, that's all part of it.
5017626	5019188	Right, I'm saying that it was paid DLC.
5019308	5022513	It was similar to the old DLC.
5022573	5024756	There was a Happy Home Paradise DLC.
5024936	5025457	That's different.
5025477	5026699	Right, that's what I'm saying.
5026779	5029403	It's very similar to that, which is kind of weird.
5029503	5038015	Not to further complicate it, but wasn't that actually bundled in for free, even though it was paid DLC, if you were like a Nintendo Plus thing?
5037995	5040050	Exactly, exactly so.
5040272	5042448	Because I would have been paying for the plus anyway.
5042529	5043617	I need a fucking map.
5045082	5069976	I think a lot of Switch 2 people are assuming they have to pay $5 to play it on Switch 2 but technically you can play the Switch 1 version on your Switch 2 and you'll get the 3.0 that's the bridge that's kind of missing I wish they would address though with it because there's the whole animation when people come to your island and leave your island now imagine and multiply that by 12
5071087	5075052	So it's going to get very... Oh, the loading area.
5075092	5082062	I think that's why you can do the disconnect thing instead, even though the leaving through the gate is supposed to be safer.
5082122	5084265	It is just all the same if the player disconnects.
5086007	5087589	Because then you don't get the animation.
5087669	5089311	It just says so and so is disconnected.
5090513	5091514	You should just have an option.
5091534	5093517	I mean, I guess it has to load stuff, but...
5095842	5104625	I mean, right now, I think, actually all it was is you just had the little, I mean, you have the thing of them walking off and on, but you don't have to watch the plane arrive and leave every time.
5106971	5109497	Only the person traveling sees the full thing.
5110979	5116103	I'm looking forward to having a reason to revisit the game again because I want a Nintendo collection in my basement.
5116123	5120847	Sure, even if I'm paying for Switch Online, I can play those games anyway.
5120867	5122909	There's just something about the collecting.
5122929	5125711	Look, I like to collect games and have them in my house.
5126112	5126792	I think a lot of us do.
5126812	5129555	They should have the PlayChoice10 stuff in there.
5129595	5130496	That's what they should have.
5130516	5133058	They should have the full arcade cabinets so you can play the PlayChoice10 stuff.
5133078	5137281	It would be cool if they had new games, but I just don't know.
5137662	5139183	I think that's asking for a lot.
5139223	5140564	I'm glad we're getting this.
5140544	5142848	What do you mean not getting new games?
5142928	5144651	You're getting Game Boy titles.
5144731	5146795	We're getting Famicom Disk System.
5146815	5149199	We're getting games that have not been available before.
5149239	5152244	Yeah, but they're all things that are on the Switch Online.
5152404	5155930	It's just a bridge to the Switch Online catalog.
5156932	5160578	Which is very clever, and it's giving people what they asked for.
5160558	5161359	No, I get it.
5162040	5162581	And I agree.
5162661	5163302	It's clever.
5163322	5164544	And I'm happy for this bridge.
5164605	5169312	But I was just like, oh, it might be kind of fun if there's a game you can only unlock through Animal Crossing.
5169352	5172677	But I understand that Nintendo doesn't want to cannibalize Switch Online.
5172698	5178747	So it's just one of those, it's a pipe dream thing that when I sit down and think, is this logistically the smartest thing to do?
5178767	5180350	I go, no, it's probably not.
5180851	5182954	So that's what it ends up.
5183238	5197483	I just think it would be great to actually now have those items for the Super Famicom or the disc system or have the actual console models in the game Yeah, I do like that it's more than just the NES models, that's kind of neat
5198527	5215243	It's funny, there's a channel I've been following that goes into some of the programming things that they did to make your game glitch out and modify for earlier versions and how much of that original code carries over into the modern Animal Crossings.
5216345	5221790	There's some stuff in there including part of its inventory system that is the same by necessity.
5223552	5227015	There's a lot... I've kind of gotten this...
5227079	5234572	Approach lately, the yeah, so and such may be annoying, but I have a feeling it is programmed that way for a very specific reason.
5234733	5237217	Or maybe it's just that Dead by Daylight has lowered my standards.
5239581	5244269	A little calm A, a little calm B. All right, let's move on.
5245171	5245792	Where are we at?
5245832	5246473	Loki, I think.
5247735	5252023	All right, let's talk about our favorite topic as of right now.
5252307	5272729	Thanks for watching!
5273266	5296692	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5298123	5300088	Yeah, the Olympic esport games were dumb.
5301250	5305660	I get the chess stuff, that makes sense, but archery on a mobile phone?
5305981	5306282	Really?
5307224	5308988	Kind of dumb.
5309108	5311153	Yeah, some of the games mentioned there.
5311173	5315102	But I mean, it also makes sense...
5315082	5323604	as to why Saudi Arabia is trying to buy up so much of video games because if they are turning it into a global sport and all of this... It could be bigger than the Olympics.
5323624	5330762	Yeah, well, think of all the money that something like MLB or NBA or those big sports leagues rake in.
5330803	5332146	That's something that...
5332126	5337775	The Saudi government wants to invest in, which is kind of kind of honestly, that's already kind of been a known thing.
5338235	5339177	So, yeah, yeah.
5339197	5348270	They're very originally we're going to be in a 12 year partnership that they agreed on a 12 year partnership back last year, actually.
5348290	5350033	And now they're just like, Nope.
5350790	5375312	but it sounds like Saudi Arabia now just wants to maybe make their own damn thing like we don't need the Olympics we'll create a must we'll pay oodles and oodles of money to get some of the big names to come to Saudi Arabia and play their big games and you know create our own pretend work crimes and how they kill people is not happening yes
5376980	5379526	That is what the ultimate hope is, yes.
5379606	5383134	That we will all just forget that all of that is going on.
5383154	5383375	Yes.
5384898	5385199	Anyway.
5387605	5388627	Let's move on.
5389838	5396048	Talk about something else I'd like to forget is going on, and that is that there's layoffs going on everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
5396068	5402999	And Amazon, as some of you have talked about in chat earlier tonight, Amazon is one of those companies that did get hit with job cuts.
5403640	5409990	And a lot of their job cuts this week ended up affecting New World, which I don't mean to sound bitchy.
5409970	5411392	because it is really sad.
5411452	5413654	I do not enjoy hearing stories of job loss.
5413815	5422585	But at the same time, I'm also surprised that New World was still going because I sort of thought that game was already sort of cooked some time ago.
5422605	5426309	It seemed like it made a big splash when it launched and then it kind of disappeared.
5426790	5437783	And unfortunately, Amazon has not had a great track record in the gaming realm, which is wild, wild when they own this site.
5437763	5441249	Here I am on my soapbox again.
5441270	5450867	How does Amazon not get this right to leverage what they have here on Twitch television into generating more hype for their games?
5451489	5455536	I don't understand the disconnect, but here we are.
5455516	5471567	and it's not just New World because New World at least it felt like it had a somewhat successful launch it just kind of sank after that it didn't it didn't hold people it was that whole you know remember I said the hot shit for six months and then then you're gone vary that with New World except it was more like two three months
5471547	5494838	Amazon wrote in a blog post at newworld.com,
5495088	5515678	Thanks for watching!
5515658	5517201	You can still buy New World.
5517421	5522830	And they are saying that PlayStation Plus subscribers for extra and premium can still get that until further notice.
5523231	5526296	And Nighthaven is apparently free for everybody right now.
5526316	5529401	And the company has committed to running the servers through 2026.
5530403	5530984	But...
5531774	5540810	They said they will provide a minimum of six months notice before making any changes that impact your ability to play New World Aeternum.
5540950	5543475	I can't wait for New New World to come out at some point.
5543575	5548444	Well, it may not because apparently Amazon, Bloomberg did a whole thing on it.
5548464	5552431	And that usually means somebody internal sent something to Jason.
5553012	5556077	And Amazon told staff in a memo that...
5556057	5562003	That as part of widespread layoffs, it's going to dial back big budget games, especially MMOs.
5562544	5565046	So Thrown in Liberty, Lost Ark.
5565066	5568129	These are MMOs that Amazon has published, even though somebody else developed them.
5568850	5569731	Those will continue.
5570652	5575337	Amazon not commenting on the Lord of the Rings MMO that apparently they've been making for a while.
5575357	5578620	I feel like Lord of the Rings, even worse, sorry, not Lord of the Rings.
5578860	5583465	Amazon, even worse than Niantic, a company I've been following for a long time.
5583445	5583805	Yeah.
5584246	5610499	Yeah.
5611947	5619074	Anyway, New World, just so you know, there are 914,000 people still playing it on Steam over the weekend.
5619114	5628944	So it's interesting, but it just sounds like maybe Amazon sort of bit off more than they can chew with the gaming thing.
5629124	5633829	Or again, I feel like Amazon may not know how to run itself as such a mega company.
5634509	5641296	Coming back to the Microsoft thing, there needs to be some type of meeting in the minds.
5641478	5647375	What is our company and what do we do?
5647395	5649641	But that's a lot to ask, apparently.
5649661	5654796	These mega companies just keep growing and growing and growing with no aim in mind.
5655147	5659932	Bobby Blackwolf says Twitch was affected, but not super affected.
5659952	5660993	They did lose some people.
5661013	5665678	Yes, I did hear that some Twitch people were unfortunately impacted with this.
5665919	5668582	Who's left running Twitch right now?
5669743	5674989	It's kind of what I want to know, but interesting.
5676090	5681616	Bobby says Microsoft should have sold off the Xbox division or made it its own company instead of buying Activision.
5682557	5682657	Yeah.
5683075	5709403	I don't know.
5709772	5712435	Quest Buster in chat says about New World.
5712495	5716780	It had a rough launch, but it managed to retain enough players to keep going.
5716840	5722848	The latest expansion was really good and brought a lot of players back right before they announced the party was over.
5722928	5723548	So that's interesting.
5723648	5729395	Yeah, if the latest expansion was good, unfortunately, the word isn't out there everywhere.
5729596	5735483	So maybe Amazon just doesn't know how to market their games.
5735503	5737585	Well, if only there was a major website.
5738847	5745596	Although I'm sure there's plenty of ads for New World on this website, but I wouldn't know because I bought the thing that hides all the ads.
5747419	5752786	They had a website that they maybe had lots of eyes in front of it and then a streaming platform.
5754148	5755670	Yeah, but they don't have that.
5756472	5756812	Anyways.
5757653	5757954	All right.
5758514	5758775	Let's see.
5758915	5760497	Jamie needed to step away for a minute.
5760677	5764703	She is up next, but I think what we'll do, we'll just skip over to Loki's story and then come back.
5765493	5774966	Alright, well, two of the directors from the Multiverses game have formed a brand new studio, Airlock Games.
5775707	5779813	And instead of making giant fighting games featuring Warner Bros.
5779833	5789526	characters, they are now making a more smaller indie title that looks a little bit like a space...
5789742	5796173	Sim type game, a little pixel art space sim game called What the Stars Forgot.
5796193	5800841	It's their brand new first game for their brand new company, Airlock Games.
5800861	5811720	They are putting it on Kickstarter and it's like, man, we're like 20 years back again and we're kickstarting games and everything is hunky dory and stuff like that.
5811921	5814906	But yeah, apparently...
5815612	5826837	I don't know, it looks interesting They're planning on launching the game in early access in December But yeah, it's a sci-fi sim management horror game
5827964	5831449	It's nice to see the phoenix from the ashes sort of thing.
5831469	5836095	I mean, I realize it's not the whole, you know, it's just a couple of the directors involved and so forth.
5836135	5843045	But it's nice to sort of see that wish of, I hope these people that are affected by the layoff can go and launch their own studio.
5843125	5843966	It's nice to see.
5844066	5846069	I realize that takes money, that takes investment.
5846109	5849234	It's nice to see that actually happen once in a while, right?
5849334	5851036	It's nice to see that that's happening.
5851056	5853820	And by golly, I hope the game is good.
5854930	5865287	Yeah, and I mean, also like with all these big game studios that seem like they can't fail or are too big to fail and that releasing, you know, products that are underwhelming or stuff like that.
5866028	5873420	And all these massive layoffs that we're having, I think you're going to see a lot of these indie studios kind of come out and a lot of them be successful.
5873460	5878288	Like we've seen that in the last few years, there's been a lot of these like game of the year projects.
5878268	5884818	titles that are from smaller independent studios where these bigger studios are like, you can't make a game like that.
5885499	5902365	Yeah, you can't make a game like that because it won't be as profitable as our shareholders want, but you can make a game like that that will be profitable for the studio and make them enough money to continue to make the next big game or the next project they want to work on if it's not a super huge game.
5902806	5903787	So I think...
5903767	5913962	hopefully we'll see a lot of these people land on their feet and maybe spin up some of these studios and see what happens but then again then they eventually get bought and it's like continues again
5914178	5921125	On that note, on a similar note, it is wild to me that Claire Obscure did not come out three years ago.
5921546	5924289	Like, the Game Awards are next month, right?
5924309	5926912	We're about a month away from the Game Awards, which is a whole other thing, right?
5927312	5934460	To which I expect Claire Obscure is going to win a lot of stuff, although I guess some people are saying there's some other... What's the other big one that just came out recently?
5934480	5935601	Claire Obscure, though, is gorgeous.
5936522	5941367	It is, and I think there's so much, you know, I think that's the one to be...
5941347	5949282	but like it's honestly honest to god it feels like that game came out three years ago like it's it's wild to me that that was a game from this year
5949397	5957207	Anyway, DarkSakura, we'll go to you in just a moment, but I do want to read some of these other comments that came in from chat on the New World thing because there is quite a bit here.
5957688	5966199	Bobby Blackwolf talking about Amazon and maybe where they misfired says, Amazon thought they could take down Steam because they were Amazon and Valve was not.
5966219	5970786	A lot of companies have felt that they could take down Steam and have had mixed success.
5970886	5975992	Maybe Epic being the only one that has had a reasonable amount of success and Epic has Fortnite.
5976333	5976433	Yeah.
5976413	5979561	and Valve had a mandatory Steam install with everything.
5979582	5981587	Plus they were kind of first out the gate in that one.
5981848	5986400	I don't know if I want to say first, but they were early out the gate with the must-have game.
5986420	5988165	They had the right formula at the right time.
5989027	5989849	Um...
5990015	5995046	Bobby says they were surprised that they couldn't just snap their fingers and make a game store and have everyone use it instead of Steam.
5995066	6001861	Well, that's the same EA with Origin, Ubisoft with Air Launcher, Stadia.
6001881	6003705	A lot of people are learning this.
6003725	6007112	And Gwen points out that New World is through Steam.
6007092	6008836	Oh yeah, yeah, it is, it is.
6009597	6015891	And Looney Barred also mentioning that they were in the game when the news hit.
6015911	6026333	People had just bought the paid track of the season and new cosmetics, and as soon as the main page told us what was happening, the game population went down by two-thirds in a few minutes.
6026431	6051072	that's wild people wanted to just abandon ship that quickly that's I don't know I feel like if a game I really loved like I don't know Final Fantasy 14 let's say they say tomorrow oh we're shutting down the Final Fantasy 14 servers I wouldn't want to like just stop playing the game all of a sudden like I don't know uh it might be in that moment you might just need to step away from it yeah yeah
6051052	6055196	Have a moment to process how much money I've spent over the years and all that.
6055337	6057759	At least with Stadia, I got all my money back.
6057859	6058520	Sure.
6058920	6059761	I guess that makes sense.
6059781	6063786	When I had to fly to Alabama, so it came in really handy.
6064046	6066729	Mishin Chat says, it makes me sad because I really like that one.
6066809	6074677	Yeah, just because I hadn't played a lot of New World, I recognize it had its fans, but it seemed like it had a real problem getting a lot of new ones.
6074697	6076279	So, I don't know.
6076299	6076539	Anyway.
6077040	6077801	All right, let's move on.
6077841	6078501	Dark Sakura.
6078782	6080063	This is exciting news to me.
6081140	6083982	Yes, and I immediately told Dan that I have to attend.
6085144	6101158	But, you know, one of my favorite ever sound designers and composers, Akira Yamaoka, or properly Yamaoka Akira, has been a mainstay in a lot of whatever playlists I have going on.
6102319	6109645	He has done a number of sound direction, including Silent Hill, of course.
6109625	6113412	The Medium, Lollipop Chainsaw, all of that.
6113532	6119102	And he is doing a US tour starting in February 20, 2026.
6120004	6125794	And he's bringing some of his soundtracks to play on stage.
6125774	6136078	and working with Raj Ramaya, who is known for his work on Cowboy Bebop and Resident Evil, who is opening for Yamaoka.
6137040	6143455	They've also collaborated on a single called Encrypted Code Reality, which will be actually available yesterday on Halloween.
6143936	6144998	Have to go get it.
6144978	6151568	But the tour dates are starting in Los Angeles on the 19th.
6152750	6156976	So I probably would be trying to go to that one, but I bet it's going to be crazy expensive.
6157877	6166109	Then show dates in Phoenix, Arizona, San Diego, Orlando, Florida, New York, Dallas, Austin.
6167051	6171998	And the tickets go on sale on Friday, November 24th.
6171978	6173922	I need to go.
6175225	6176988	Someone needs to make this happen for me.
6177008	6181979	This news is actually really upsetting to me because his tour is the same week.
6181999	6188873	It's all like the dates are like it's only like 10 days and it's when I'm on the Star Trek cruise.
6188853	6217122	I fly out on the 19th and I get back on the 27th yeah it's just bad bad luck on my part I mean if I really wanted to go I would pick one or the other um but I'm not gonna say actually technically that Orlando date is the day after we get back and the cruise is out of Orlando so you bet your ass the thought has crossed my mind could I extend my stay for a day so I can go to that concert but there comes a point where I start to go
6217962	6221828	I think we're crossing the line into that's irresponsible at this point.
6221908	6225734	I have to get back to my real life and everything after all that.
6225754	6226935	But don't cry for me.
6226955	6230220	I'm going on an adventure that I love to do every year.
6230441	6232464	It is what it is.
6232664	6234166	I was bummed when I saw the dates.
6234206	6234767	I'm like, really?
6235027	6237070	Of all the weeks in the year, he had to pick that one?
6237091	6239053	Well, I hope it does really well.
6239815	6242398	He just knew that you weren't going to be able to go during those times.
6242418	6242619	Exactly.
6242639	6243480	It's all about me.
6243460	6247165	Like, this crazy American's gonna go on a boat instead of listening to me?
6247505	6257157	Well, he is on my Facebook, but if he's smart, he's not reading it either, so... I don't look at it anymore.
6257177	6260241	As 200 Matt says, maybe he'll add more dates if it sells well.
6260261	6261683	And that's kind of where I'm at.
6261703	6271695	I'm like, I still wish, as much as I'm salty, I wish this thing nothing but huge success, because if he makes lots of money for his family...
6271675	6275286	He'll probably do it again and maybe I can go the next time.
6275306	6276309	That would be lovely.
6276329	6278636	So I wish this nothing but success.
6279077	6285236	And for those that can go, please take pictures of the merch and let me know what I can send you money for.
6285256	6285617	All right.
6287099	6294248	By the way, that concert last night, the Final Fantasy thing, the merch line, unreal.
6294268	6296130	Half the venue was in line for merch.
6296331	6296891	I shit you not.
6296932	6300276	They were selling, I think, a bunch of vinyls that I saw a ton of people.
6300316	6305502	I don't know if maybe it was the first time some of them were on sale, but I swear I saw a ton of people walking out of that merch line with vinyls.
6307104	6310289	Oh, speaking of which, did I tell you what arrived a month ago?
6310309	6311470	No.
6311804	6341507	my N7 four disc four record collection for Mass Effect oh that's fun the box set I never got into the vinyl thing but I kind of feel like I want to I have a bunch and I haven't hooked up my record player yet I want to get one of those like my parents used to have the shelf that had the record player built into it I'd love to get one of those like old school like a console yeah yeah like from the 70s type of thing I'd love that thrift stores maybe maybe
6341656	6367528	I honestly would like one that uses glass transistors that'd be fun alright we got another story here before we get to the classic game and it has to do with another let's shit on Xbox story and I'm not intending to do this but it's just again there's a lot of yeah exactly this is what people are talking about this week the new spiritual successor to Pixel Poops it's X Shit
6367508	6378158	One of the designers from the Doom series, Sandy Peterson, coming out on Twitter to talk about, I should call it X because Twitter is dead.
6378978	6394552	Sandy Peterson came out on X and said that Ensemble Studios, where he worked into 2000s, apparently Ensemble and the Halo MMO were scrapped by Don Matrick, who was the head of the Xbox at the time.
6394572	6397515	And we all know he was a terrible boss for Microsoft.
6397495	6402970	and he said in 2008 Ensemble Studios started planning a gigantic MMO set in the Halo universe.
6403451	6405176	We codenamed it Titan.
6405196	6407342	It was to take place tens of thousands a year.
6407683	6409468	Why does everybody call their MMO Titan?
6409729	6411173	I was going to say why Blizzard did the same fucking thing.
6411193	6412737	Stop calling your cancelled MMOs Titan.
6412717	6414420	Anyway, we codenamed it Titan.
6414440	6420352	It was to take place tens of thousands of years ago before the Halos were set off and destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.
6421033	6430472	Anyway, it goes on and on and said the lowest estimate we and Microsoft had for the game's total income was $1.1 billion.
6431785	6436950	But apparently, Dom Matric came in and canceled it.
6437491	6445739	It was all brought to naught when Dom Matric realized that his stock bonus was based on the income Microsoft had from games in three years.
6446440	6450384	You see, we estimated three and a half years to finish Titan if we did it right.
6450885	6452887	That's beyond Matric's drop-dead date.
6453247	6460915	So by firing all of Ensemble, he didn't have to pay for our expensive studio for three years, and he didn't care about Titan.
6460895	6465363	All he lost was a game studio who never sold less than 3 million copies of everything we made.
6465944	6472716	I don't believe he did justice to Microsoft stockholders, but hey, Don started as an EA hatchet man, so what would you expect?
6473417	6473918	Yikes!
6474619	6481131	But if we were to bring out the wield of plausibility, do we believe that Don Matrick would make a dumbass decision like this?
6481111	6481912	Yes, we do.
6482392	6489940	So it's one of those things that just goes to, you know, and maybe other people would look at it and go, well, he got the stock bonus.
6489960	6493183	So was it a bad decision or was it a smart one?
6493203	6498569	To which I say, shut the fuck up.
6498589	6502713	Anyhow, let's go back to a simpler time with our next segment.
6502733	6506697	Let's go back to an era well before stock bonuses, at least I think they were.
6517544	6524977	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6525418	6528243	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6528604	6533332	And apologies, a little bit of the loud noise from said game making its way out over the stream there.
6533933	6536177	But what did you pick tonight, DarkSakura, for the classic game?
6536680	6543818	I picked a game that is more colloquially known outside of Japan as Gourmet Warriors.
6544139	6552259	Its actual name is Bishoku Sentai Barayaro, which is Rose Rascal's Gourmet Squadron.
6552239	6557008	This is a side-scrolling beat-em-up.
6557028	6562158	It was developed by WINS and published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment for the Super Famicom in 1995.
6562219	6564483	Of course, Japanese-only release.
6567288	6571176	We'll get into the re-release about it a little bit later.
6571156	6600252	but it's basically it's just like a total lampoon on Sentai the Sentai genre so you have five stages with a time limit and you lose you basically have to go through and pick up ingredients and each of these stages you lose all of your ingredients when the timer reaches zero but you have multiple lives so you can just
6600232	6603596	It's like if the character dies, it's an automatic game over.
6605178	6615331	So you have to focus on the time limit if you want to recuperate your strength after fighting the final boss.
6615912	6624042	You also have a button in the game that makes the character do sentai poses when held down and used with a directional pad.
6625124	6626485	It's just there for flex.
6626746	6627707	That's all it is.
6628413	6645149	So basically in the year 20XDX, you have a city known as Zeus Heaven Magic City, recovered after World War III, and the inhabitants have to ingest protein in whatever food they can find.
6646310	6655078	And there is an organization called Bath that basically is just constantly expanding corporate, you know,
6655058	6667465	Thanks for watching!
6669368	6688634	I love that their names are just like we have.
6689856	6690156	Hello!
6690196	6690617	Hello!
6691137	6692459	We have Ma'am.
6693621	6694763	And we have Very Good.
6695264	6696005	Those are their names.
6698248	6700272	Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien.
6701534	6703256	So, anyway.
6705901	6711049	Retro Gamer gave it a 79% saying that one should at least play it once.
6711409	6716598	Their quote is, if you can stomach Chowai Nikki or enjoy it, then this might be right up your alley.
6717659	6718140	Um...
6719167	6720850	Yeah, it's a silly one.
6721131	6724096	I think it's hilarious.
6725198	6731329	And it got re-released on January 30th, 2018, Blaze Pro Pico Interactive.
6731349	6739825	And they also, Pico, created and published a US SNES cartridge with a full English translation called Gourmet Warriors.
6741526	6763433	so there you go that's the game there's not much else to it I have to admit not not a game I think I ever have seen somehow but um very very much of that you know Final Fight clone era uh but kind of yeah I'd check this out there's always beat-em-ups where are you getting new beat-em-ups now based on old things yeah that's true that's true so
6763733	6765135	Check it out.
6765155	6773344	I also just think that the cover is absolute fan service because Mademoiselle there is very busty.
6773965	6776268	Boobalicious?
6776288	6777028	Busty.
6777049	6778090	She's busting out.
6778330	6779371	It's armor.
6779431	6780352	She's highly armored.
6780653	6782174	Her boobs are not armored.
6783476	6785679	The most protected part of her boobs are the nips.
6786600	6786900	Alright.
6787621	6792286	Let's cover a couple other quick topics here in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
6792366	6792947	Loki.
6793822	6799485	Alright, so Limited Run Games is having their 10th anniversary.
6799505	6801132	Has it really been that long?
6801449	6829853	and they've done a lot of announcements of Switch games coming out so starting off we have Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny coming out next year Little Goody Two Shoes Turbo Overkill Jay and Silent Bob's Chronic Blunt Punch Xenotilt Hostile Pinball Action that's a cool name TMNT Tactical Takedown Bad Cheese
6830373	6853292	I love these names, Fuga Melodies of Steel 1 and 2 and 3 coming next year, Fear Effect 2, Retro Helix, Choa Aineke Collection, Valiant Hearts, Coming Home, Double Shake, Slam City with Scottie Pippen, Respect Edition, Broken Reality,
6853357	6878372	Renane, Lil Samson, Arrow the Acrobat Collection, Ernest Evans Collection, Sigma Star Saga DX, Shantae, it's a brand new game, Keyman and the Masters of the Universe, Dragon Pearl of Destruction, I think that's a beat-em-up game too, which sounds awesome, Capcom, Arcade Stadium is also coming out, 2026.
6879253	6880815	Lots of physical releases.
6882027	6883509	that unfortunately I probably won't buy.
6883529	6885211	There was something really interesting I was seeing.
6885231	6900030	I think Dark Tetsuya posted it to Blue Sky, but apparently something about how the Little Samson, like the way that they're releasing it has to do with like trademark abandonment in Japan is like how they were able to actually make that happen.
6900311	6909182	I'm trying to actually pull up his feed to see if I can find that originally skeet on that.
6909989	6916118	but of course now I can't find it I hate that term so much sorry about that um
6916182	6917444	Oh, here it is.
6917464	6918285	Note to the legals.
6918686	6921490	LRG using Japan's arbitration system.
6921510	6924514	Oh, this is a post from All City Slop Shop.
6925495	6926196	Note to the legals.
6926377	6931804	LRG is using Japan's arbitration system for orphaned games to reissue Little Samson.
6931824	6942139	If you can demonstrate that you've made a genuine effort to contact or identify a potential rights owner to no avail, you can legally commercialize an old game by paying royalties to the Japanese government.
6943182	6946066	and apparently that is how Little Samson is happening.
6946086	6948510	To which I say, Guardian Legend wins.
6948530	6950693	How many royalties do you have to pay for Guardian Legends?
6950713	6951834	Right, exactly.
6951854	6953817	And then Dark Tootsie posted President Cat.
6954118	6958364	But I think there was a tie into a TV thing with that particular game.
6958504	6961048	So that one's going to be a lot harder.
6961068	6962710	But that's kind of neat.
6963382	6965845	I have President Cat on my portable emulation device.
6966766	6966967	All right.
6966987	6968989	Anyway, what else do you have in the news front, Loki?
6969670	6970031	All right.
6970251	6975218	And then along with that, we have a Call of Duty movie coming.
6977240	6977721	Yay.
6979103	6984470	They're being written by the writers from Yellowstone and Friday Night Lights.
6986212	6988135	Okay, well, I can see the demo now.
6988856	6988956	Cool.
6990518	6991279	Cool.
6992727	6994474	Yeah, I can't wait to not see that movie.
6994614	6995498	Alright.
6996924	6999092	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
7000760	7013752	Well, it's a code for the Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight for Saturn, also known, it was the Castlevania Cynthia Knight version, the one that I just finished playing through.
7014813	7017515	It has kind of an Easter egg now.
7017795	7024501	It's escaped notice for years, but if you enter your name in as staff, you get right to the credit.
7024521	7028725	So maybe any percent speed run, shenanigans?
7030865	7033449	All right.
7033690	7040100	And as mentioned in the intro to tonight's show by Jason, a little tribute there to Mauro Farina.
7040120	7041081	I hope I said that right.
7041582	7047812	A really large name in Italian Eurobeat and Eurodance scene who was a producer there.
7048413	7050416	He did pass away this week at the age of 68.
7050517	7052620	If you actually look up his book,
7052600	7057005	Bio, or just search like RemiWiki for some of the things he's contributed to.
7057545	7068818	Boom Boom Dollar, The Red Monster Mix, Upside Down, which was... So he released a lot of things under pseudonyms, just like a lot of people that worked on the old DDR did back in the day.
7069599	7071841	You Leave Me Alone, he had a credit on that.
7072822	7076046	So he had a lot to do with the old DDR series.
7076286	7079890	And if you were a fan of...
7079870	7081733	You know, some of the legendary songs in that game.
7081753	7083476	You probably heard his work at some point.
7083496	7084898	So, RIP.
7085279	7088444	68, pretty young in the grand scheme of things.
7088464	7091489	So, very unfortunate.
7091509	7093853	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
7093913	7094835	Let's start in the US.
7094935	7095516	Loki.

7473224	7473745	Did I not say?
7473905	7477370	No, I just loved that there's a game called I Hate This Place.
7477390	7478472	What is the place?
7479774	7480755	Honestly?
7480775	7482738	Is it just America in 2025?
7482758	7486864	This is a UK release, though.
7487144	7489508	It could still be somebody's on a trip over here.
7489528	7490209	I hate this place.
7490810	7491110	All right.
7491611	7495356	Anyway, just one other quick story for you before we get to the listener roundtable tonight.
7495797	7498401	Loki definitely thought of you when I saw this headline.
7498461	7499402	Can't imagine why.
7500361	7529760	hmm uh yeah so apparently the the thing that we could have had a Kojima Matrix game uh the Wachowskis did approach uh Hideo Kojima on the possibility of making a Matrix game back in the late 90s um unfortunately Konami being Konami at the time said nope
7530382	7532325	You can't do it.
7532345	7534789	So that's annoying.
7534850	7541521	Yeah, so they were shut down by the higher ups at Konami, the vice president of licensing at Konami Digital.
7541881	7543544	Talk about screwing up.
7543624	7547691	This would have been right in the beginning of that era where Konami really didn't know what the fuck they were doing.
7547972	7549494	So that's too bad.
7550456	7552119	We're going to put it all on Patchy Slot.
7552479	7554162	At the same time, though.
7555087	7558352	I'm just saying it's not too late.
7558713	7560255	It's really not too late to do it.
7560395	7560716	It isn't.
7560876	7561517	I agree.
7561697	7562399	You know what?
7562759	7567907	If that's the game he wants to make, I actually would be super curious about that.
7569470	7572695	I would like to see it.
7572715	7573416	It's not too late.
7573717	7580947	Listener Roundtable, we're going to take your calls over at our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
7581047	7589499	If you all want to stay in touch after the 23rd as well, Discord is going to be a great place to do it and any of our future projects will certainly be promoted over there.
7589940	7591702	VOG Network is continuing as well.
7591803	7596349	Bobby Blackwolf is still going to be there and whatever else is cooked up by us in the future.
7596329	7614000	And one email.
7613980	7615163	Okay, we'll get to that too.
7615865	7622123	Ranmari sent us a tweet saying that they got the Street Fighter burgers and actually sent a picture.
7622484	7624289	Yeah, and I was like, oh, those do look kind of good.
7624309	7626896	Why is McDonald's better than it is?
7626916	7627157	Anyway.
7627879	7629002	Um...
7628982	7636131	DarkDeadSea, talking about our last episode, sent us a message saying, I was catching up on last week's show on this Tuesday evening.
7636151	7638634	Exorbitant thank you to Rob for mentioning my situation.
7638654	7641618	It was a pretty rough October for us then to have that fall into my lap.
7641658	7642800	It was not fun.
7642820	7647486	Keep up on the medical stuff if you are able, which I think is a very good life lesson for everybody.
7647866	7650270	If something doesn't feel right, it's probably not right.
7650290	7654014	So at least talk to a teledoctor.
7654855	7657639	If not, go into the office and be seen by one once in a while.
7657619	7666231	and Mish followed that up saying, you haven't got a clue about, I think this was a few days later, but I'll read it anyway because it's adorable.
7666311	7669575	Mish said, you haven't got a clue about how much I love him, do you?
7670036	7674161	And I'll be forever grateful to at Orange Launch Radio for helping us find each other.
7674682	7683754	We may never officially get married, but as my mother says, legalities aside, we are already married and it's till death do us part from here on out.
7683774	7685196	As far as I'm concerned, Mish,
7685176	7689721	If you say you're married and he says he's married, if the two parties say they're married, they're married.
7689741	7698491	And this is coming from somebody whose marriage is back up for debate in this country and could possibly in the next few years no longer be legally married at the national level.
7699052	7708062	And so, you know, I might be in a similar... I realize our situations are very different, but it's one of those things where it's like...
7708042	7714552	The government is not going to tell me how to feel about the guy I've been with for over 15 years.
7715233	7716796	And y'all know how I feel about that.
7716816	7717938	I don't need to say nothing else.
7718358	7721503	So, Mish, you're as good as married to me.
7723406	7725410	Fuck what the government says.
7725530	7729476	They're not getting a lot of things correct lately, so we don't care what they think.
7730620	7732122	Um, let's see.
7732142	7736186	Bobby in chat did some research on I Hate This Place.
7736206	7738789	Apparently it is a survival horror game.
7738809	7743334	The place is a creepy ranch at night that you're trying to survive.
7744356	7748320	And Bobby says they greenlit a new Matrix movie without the Wachowski sisters.
7748620	7749181	Is that true?
7750382	7751203	I would be surprised.
7751223	7754367	Yeah, I think there was a new Matrix movie coming out.
7754549	7755631	That's going to be something.
7755651	7756212	All right.
7756232	7757134	We have a call in the green room.
7757154	7757976	I do want to get to it.
7758036	7761002	So let's bring them on into our broadcast room.
7761062	7762224	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7762244	7762665	Who's this?
7764188	7765892	Hey, this is AJ Twist.
7766072	7767315	AJ, it's been a while.
7767355	7769359	How are you doing, my friend?
7769379	7770341	Doing pretty well.
7770621	7771002	Yeah.
7771182	7771984	Good to hear from you.
7772707	7773830	Yeah, thank you.
7773850	7777259	I'm calling in to kind of make a confession.
7778102	7778322	Okay.
7779164	7788690	I guess I'll start off by saying, since you guys will be ending the show soon, I started listening to you guys way back in the To Go edition.
7788670	7794801	That was a while ago.
7794841	7812872	Was that like 06, 07?
7813156	7814678	What's it called?
7814758	7827458	Unfocused Podcasts How long have you been doing it?
7828159	7838775	That sounds like my life
7839683	7840464	It's our life too.
7841826	7843528	How long have you been doing it?
7843548	7846771	It's so unfocused that we're currently on hiatus right now.
7846811	7847893	Not sure if we'll come back.
7847913	7850436	We've been on a hiatus for like about three years now.
7850456	7851617	Maybe two or three years now.
7852658	7854360	We've done that before once too.
7854480	7857143	We took like a one or two year break at one point as well.
7857164	7858585	You know, just life stuff happens.
7858645	7861348	My co-host started a family.
7861429	7862750	He has like two kids right now.
7862850	7865633	So we're kind of taking a break because of that.
7865653	7869538	But we've gone like, I think we started in 2008.
7869518	7869998	Wow.
7870479	7871420	It's when we started ours.
7871720	7875443	And I think we went like 300 episodes deep.
7875463	7875964	Good for you.
7876865	7879607	And that really is, thank you for saying that.
7879647	7887654	That really is one of the absolute nicest compliments we can get over the years is that somebody says, I was inspired to do my own thing.
7888115	7890817	You know, it's a weird way of looking at it.
7890837	7891958	Don't take this the wrong way, AJ.
7892459	7894320	It's a weird way of looking at it, admittedly.
7894360	7896622	But I think about all these children that we have.
7896883	7899525	And so many children we don't even know about.
7899505	7900808	Okay, Mamoru.
7901690	7903794	That's exactly the joke I wanted to make, too.
7904817	7910168	I was going to say, you know how people, you know, sleep around, come around 18 years later.
7910449	7913616	All I had to do was whisper some things in your ear.
7915520	7921035	Omelette du Fromage It is quite the compliment.
7921075	7922078	It really truly is.
7922118	7923181	So thank you for saying that.
7923322	7930963	I know there's other shows I know Anime Jam Session has said openly they were inspired by part by what we were doing here.
7930943	7932565	They're still going.
7932585	7935908	And, you know, DarkSakura has been talking about a successor project.
7936129	7939753	And so that's, you know, there's plenty of kids out there.
7939773	7950805	And so hopefully that sense of like, don't be an asshole to people on the internet and get all the voices in the room and hear some different perspectives and listen to some things in different ways.
7951225	7954509	Hopefully a lot of that kind of carries on from this.
7954529	7957272	And yeah, it's just, it's...
7957252	7964643	There's a lot of awesome people that listen to this show, and I'm really happy to hear that many of them are taking it forward in their own ways.
7964783	7967768	I think that really truly is the nicest compliment, so thank you.
7969110	7977322	Yeah, and then hopefully, I mean, yeah, I would like to get back and do some more shows again once my co-host can find some time again.
7978003	7982910	Especially now since you guys are leaving, it's like, okay, where am I going to get my news from?
7982950	7984553	I've got to start doing my own news again.
7985113	7986195	I'm doing something, huh?
7987340	7989902	Okay, yeah, we'll see what comes out then.
7991104	7992325	We'll check that out for sure, though.
7994287	7996489	I want to ask, too, a couple things.
7996549	8001674	Number one, because I remember when we first started our podcast, it was so jank.
8001754	8004517	We were literally using Rock Band.
8004537	8005678	This one still is.
8005778	8008501	What are you talking about?
8008521	8011644	I was using a headset I stole from my old job.
8012745	8016148	Yeah, what kind of equipment did you guys have in the first few episodes?
8016297	8019641	I had a Plantronics call center headset.
8020963	8031317	We had a cheap-ass Radio Shack mic, which was like a $10 mic, which probably was just an exposed wire, like literally in a plastic case.
8031778	8041090	If you actually go back and listen to that first episode, so something about OLR's history that not everybody knows, Loki made himself a co-host on this show by showing up every episode.
8041130	8042112	And I'm so thankful.
8042372	8043874	I wouldn't have had it any other way.
8043854	8051843	If you go back to that first episode and listen to Loki's comments, he literally sounds like he's talking into a tin can, and it's because he is.
8051863	8054306	That was a real shit microphone that he was using.
8054746	8059592	I want to say I was also using one of the headsets, because I believe that's how we were running it.
8059892	8072646	DarkSakura and I used headsets, and then all the guests that were in the room would use this little... We had a microphone that I would say you could walk up to, but literally it was sitting on the edge of the unused fireplace.
8072626	8097402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8097382	8127220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8127200	8157122	but I think also brings me back to kind of like my main point which is so many people out there that want to get into podcasting get so focused on having the right equipment and yes it helps it's necessary you want to be able to sound good you know it will turn people off if you're hard to hear you have volume issues and things like that but I will say this do not let it stop you from creating because it is far harder
8157102	8160567	to have the discipline to keep it going week after week.
8160587	8162910	You've got to make it a habit for yourself.
8163511	8165394	And that's the only way you're going to be able to stick with it.
8165414	8176309	That's the only way we've been able to do this for as long as we have is to be able to say like every Sunday night is OLR time and have that for 23 years and have that set into our routine.
8176289	8205891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8205871	8212669	Yeah, we had rock band microphones and we plugged in two of them into our computer that was barely running at the time.
8212689	8222395	And I remember listening back to it and there was desync issues between the mics and I had to go do a lot of editing in there to just fix it, make it sound good because...
8222375	8245378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8245358	8247941	Like, in my technical mind, I was like, it's rough.
8248081	8250404	But I was like, actually, this is kind of funny.
8250985	8255250	Like, we were actually kind of on it, like, in the very beginning.
8255650	8257292	It was fun to go back and listen.
8259494	8260255	Yeah.
8260275	8265602	My other question, too, for you guys was about DDR, because you guys came from the DDR days.
8266162	8267384	I kind of missed that boat.
8267444	8270888	I think I got on the boat, like, right when it was shipping out.
8270968	8272610	So I got in late.
8272630	8274572	So I never saw any tournaments before.
8274552	8278799	And I don't know if you guys remember what I've come through and talked about, but I go to like tournaments.
8278819	8282405	I go to like fighting games tournaments, like GC, EVO, all that.
8282625	8284428	So I've seen bracket style tournaments.
8285330	8286972	What were DDR tournaments like?
8287013	8287774	How was that run?
8287814	8289697	Like, was there brackets?
8289857	8291640	Was there, was it just judges?
8291660	8293984	I know there's freestyles, so you need judges for that.
8294565	8296408	Like what were, what were those like?
8296895	8299580	Most of them were separated into two categories.
8299600	8308696	You would tip the standard, quote unquote, the boilerplate DDR tournament would have perfect attack that ran during the day and then freestyle competition that started at night.
8309057	8311902	So perfect attack could kind of be done one of two ways.
8311922	8314106	You could be competing for a high score.
8314126	8317472	Usually I found that tournaments with less entries were going that way.
8317492	8319155	Like you play a qualifier song.
8319656	8322160	I would say maybe you're...
8322140	8328108	Average setup would be that a qualifier song or sometimes I've even seen ones where you could pick from one of three.
8328128	8334517	And that qualifier song would place you into the bracket of eight or the bracket of 16, depending on how many participants were doing this thing.
8334837	8344570	And then you would go head to head on different songs that were pre selected by people not participating, you know, in envelopes or what have you to compete head to head for a higher score.
8344550	8349800	The best I ever did in Perfect Attack was I got fourth place in some tournament.
8349820	8355590	I beat somebody big to get there, so it was like, oh, who did that?
8356171	8358014	But then it was like, I never did that good again.
8359597	8361681	What were the songs?
8361661	8384378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8385050	8402721	Paranoia Evolution It wasn't always the hardest songs because sometimes the pop songs with the strange step charts were actually more challenging because you didn't... I think that's how I got...
8402701	8432252	And now Pink Dinosaur
8433143	8434985	You know what I was playing when I started?
8435005	8437148	Oh, Xanadu.
8438069	8438870	Paranoia.
8439951	8441053	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8441073	8443636	I started with the first mix at home.
8445638	8449823	But anyway, then you would have the freestyle at night, and yes, it was judges.
8450003	8454789	So you'd enter, and they'd call people up in a random order or whatever, and that whole thing.
8454889	8458974	And I remember, because there was a tournament Jamie and I did at Milpitas.
8459054	8460636	I don't remember if Loki was there, but Jamie...
8460616	8464480	I was there.
8464740	8488986	I was there.
8488966	8513978	and so we entered freestyle and we did it so Jamie and I entered freestyle obviously we were screen starers which is a terrible thing to do but I feel like I actually feel like we did decent like considering that like we didn't know the note chart and we hadn't practiced beforehand I feel like we got enough baps in on each other with the bat that it was kind of funny for a minute plastic trumpets
8514008	8520087	for a minute it was funny I'm sure the crowd was annoyed because we weren't a rehearsed routine but I don't care
8522159	8523962	and then an orange badge.
8523982	8524864	Is that how Orange Lounge Radio?
8524884	8526747	No, we're talking about it.
8527007	8527889	This is pre-OLR.
8527909	8529371	Yeah, this is pre-OLR.
8529872	8531194	No, funny enough, that is not.
8531315	8532376	Orange Bat Radio.
8532396	8533819	It is funny that that came into it.
8534200	8540430	No, the name was because, again, sort of the boilerplate and where we started Under Sedation Live.
8540490	8544437	Under Sedation is a line from the Time Warp and the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Riff Raff.
8544417	8574424	Orange Lounge
8574404	8591397	I mean, it was a great decision for the time, but it definitely hurt our discoverability factor in the later iTunes era because we were not the show that we may be the oldest show, but we were not the show that decided to call ourselves video game news radio or gaming lounge radio or something like that.
8591477	8592639	No disrespect to any show.
8592680	8593762	That's I'm just you.
8594162	8594944	You beat us to it.
8595385	8596547	So it is what it is.
8596797	8599842	I feel the same way with the Unfocused podcast.
8599882	8600943	I don't think that really helped.
8602386	8603788	But we were unfocused though.
8603808	8609617	We were not only gaming, but we talked about comics, anime, and just nerd stuff really.
8610218	8612882	I will say this.
8612862	8623213	It's part of the reason, I don't think I've ever said this, it's part of the reason I rushed a podcast that went for about 10 episodes, not even that, maybe 7, called Pokestop Podcast.
8623233	8625996	I used to do that show with Shane for a hot minute.
8626517	8635967	I rushed that podcast to a reality fast to get the name Pokestop Podcast as soon as Pokemon Go came out.
8635947	8637329	I remember that.
8637369	8648064	I don't know if you remember, but I think I contacted you over Twitter and I wanted to be a co-host for a day, but my schedule didn't work out that day.
8648144	8649746	Bummer, because I probably would have done it.
8649826	8655174	We had some fun episodes, but I was not into the mainline games at that time.
8655935	8659720	And the allure of Pokemon Go kind of wore off for Shane real fast, I think.
8659740	8663305	So unfortunately it did get, but I was, man, we had the name.
8664449	8688094	so but it is what it is yeah I remember writing a whole like script of what I wanted to talk about too I remember I probably have it in my notes my phone somewhere actually that's awesome well we could still do that episode you know if you have you have two minutes right now I can all right well maybe maybe another time because we got to wrap up tonight's show but anything else on your mind tonight AJ
8688800	8690182	No, that was about it.
8690202	8698154	I just wanted to just admit that and just say thank you for all the shows you guys put on over the years, all the great, just the news.
8698174	8703942	It's hard to find good news shows that you just would like to hear.
8704343	8706205	Other news shows, they're just so plain.
8706546	8711533	They just maybe don't give enough, I don't know, like...
8711513	8739630	connections to other stuff like a fun way of just explaining news again like you guys started off as just friends talking together just you know BSing and just having that vibe as well as the info at the same time which is you know I really vibe with that I used to like just sneak you guys into work too speaking of Platronics headsets I wired my headset that I used to work in my office job way back to my iPod just to listen to you guys too at night when there was no calls coming in oh my gosh
8739610	8741796	Yeah, so, yeah, just thanks.
8742096	8745445	I hear that, and I hear the PSP thing a lot.
8745465	8755712	Like, Loki building OLR PSP was, like, the best marketing thing that... Well, second to iTunes was the best thing... Well, I'm thinking about it in my mind.
8755692	8765666	Somewhere, iTunes, All Games, and that were all the big moments that this show got more exposure.
8765806	8769832	And the PSP thing, I hear an awful lot about when this show got discovered.
8769852	8771574	So kudos to you, Loki.
8771594	8773397	You're the marketing genius on that one.
8773647	8775248	I don't even know how I did it.
8775268	8777610	I don't either in retrospect, but good job.
8777991	8780313	Anyway, AJ, thank you so much for calling in.
8780333	8786819	And if we don't get a chance to hear from you again before it's all over, I really want to appreciate your words here and what you said.
8786839	8794645	And thanks for being... I know we don't hear from you all the time, but I appreciate your perspective on what goes on at EVO and the fighting game community and all of that.
8794986	8796687	Just really appreciate you being part of the fam.
8797228	8802152	And again, none of us are dying and we hope to see you in our future projects.
8802925	8803507	Sounds good.
8803527	8804429	Thank you so much, guys.
8804770	8805071	All right.
8805251	8805853	Take care, AJ.
8805953	8806394	Have a great night.
8806414	8806855	Have a good night.
8807497	8807617	Bye.
8807637	8807938	Thank you.
8809542	8810004	All right.
8811427	8812590	All right.
8812610	8813092	Yeah, let's do it.
8813132	8813593	Email.
8814923	8816386	Hey, OLR crew.
8816626	8817067	It's Rin.
8817468	8821555	As I write this email, I'm on a Shinkansen train from Nagoya to Tokyo.
8821656	8822557	Hope you're doing well.
8823239	8828488	I started listening in 2006 after seeing the OLR domain on a tapestry at Fanime.
8828909	8834820	I distinctly remembered listening during the university orientation downtime as at the time I had just graduated high school.
8835241	8838467	Now I'm 36 and I'm a working-ass adult trademark.
8838447	8857553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8857533	8864242	The most surprising was finding an AXE on Senichimai near Dotonbori.
8864743	8878562	It looked like your usual metal games and crane game arcades at first, but I was shocked when I went to the third floor and found an entire row of shmups in great condition and with auto-fire buttons to save players from suffering repetitive stress injury.
8878542	8883509	I'm disappointed I only discovered this right before I left for Nagoya.
8884050	8889157	I've also been playing Sega's rhythm games, MaiMai, Chunidham, Ongeki.
8890098	8896927	They're miles better than Benmani in my honest opinion, both in terms of gameplay style and ease of getting into them.
8897067	8899451	MaiMai cabinets just started rolling out across the U.S.
8899511	8904077	Round 1 branches, and I hope Chunidham follows suit soon.
8904057	8908222	Also, the risk of being canceled by American gamers and branded as a traitor to gamers in the West.
8908563	8916853	I played some metal games, similar to coin pusher games in the West, particularly Marble Fever, known in the US as Marble Carnival, which is a marble pusher game.
8918115	8927107	And yeah, they're about as deep as you can expect gambling games to be, but ball mazes and contraptions activate my autistic stems, and so does getting big-ass jackpots.
8927167	8929069	Kind of the same, I'll admit.
8929049	8946535	it should be noted that metal games technically aren't gambling since the medals you win and use to play can be redeemed for cash or prizes hence why they're called amusement games literally just for a dopamine rush or gambling minus the actual stakes while I can make do without playing them I just look
8946515	8949961	Just like looking at them for their noticeably high quality artwork.
8950662	8952846	Anyways, I'm going to enjoy Tokyo for the next week.
8953246	8956672	I look forward to keeping in touch with you folks even after OLR has ended.
8956792	8957834	Much love and take care.
8958395	8959317	System Clarity.
8959577	8960298	Rin Clarity.
8960419	8961300	Mari Clarity.
8962428	8965772	And thank you for the commitment to stay in touch when it ends.
8966853	8969476	We always hang out at California Extreme every year.
8969716	8970758	Yeah.
8971138	8976725	So I'm thankful you're having a great time in Japan.
8976785	8979087	I'm thankful you came back after all these years too.
8979127	8989279	And it's funny because I think every podcaster who's been doing this a long time, I know Bobby, I think I'm stealing this line from Bobby, but says, I have a lot of former listeners.
8989259	9015351	and sometimes that's kind of how it feels here too and that's that's okay that's not a read that's not like it just you know I can think of shows I used to I think of TV shows I used to watch every single week without fail that I don't watch as much of anymore RuPaul's Drag Race great example because I even had a podcast on that with some buddies for a hot minute I don't watch Drag Race anymore it's hard to avoid on social media I kind of see the highlights and stuff but I don't I don't really watch that stuff anymore so um
9015331	9043549	and it's not that I hate it or anything in fact I love a lot of the talent that comes from that stuff but Survivor I don't watch every week religiously like I used to or like maybe The Simpsons probably for a lot of people like we all used to watch The Simpsons you know for those first couple years not all but you know a lot of us did and now a lot less do or South Park would be another good example of that that used to be like must see TV in the college dorms and then you know I only see what I see on social media so anyway
9043529	9045032	is a lot of former listeners.
9045252	9046816	So, and that's okay.
9046876	9051345	I hope, I noticed OG Happy Dude just came into chat going, wait, wait, OLR sending.
9051365	9055814	So I'm sorry, the news is only just now reaching some people.
9055954	9058078	I'm actually sitting here thinking,
9058615	9070433	I probably need to do something I don't want to do and log into Twitter just to get the message out to people that maybe have left some time ago and haven't followed us over to Blue Sky or whatever.
9070453	9081229	As much as it's paining me to say it, I feel like I might need to send a note just so people know they only have a few more chances to catch us in this form until whatever the future may hold.
9081249	9082892	All right.
9083893	9084454	Um...
9085430	9086151	What else?
9086171	9086753	That's it.
9086773	9087073	Emails.
9087133	9090760	If you want to send us an email, participate at orangelawntrader.com.
9091201	9094969	I would highly encourage you to get those emails in in the next two weeks.
9096371	9101542	Because on the last episode, I don't think we're going to really have the time to read 17 emails.
9102163	9104367	Not that I think we would get that many.
9104684	9111842	I would like to make sure that everybody who wants to call in on the last episode has a chance.
9111862	9117556	We may have to put in the two-minute timer, but I would like everybody... I was kind of stewing on it.
9117576	9118819	I was like, do we want to open the following?
9118839	9119180	Do we not?
9119921	9122608	This really is...
9122588	9143770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9143750	9173385	so long for now goodbye baby tell me why beep beep oh maybe that'll be the thing if there's too many people then we're going to require that you sing your favorite DDR song to get on I'm just kidding but anyway so that's where you know where we're kind of leaning right now so Jamie says she'll read 17 emails if you send them but I would really encourage you to get those I didn't say that well yes you did you said try me you said watch me I said try me I didn't say I would get through all of them
9173973	9176059	Okay, she'll abbreviate them all.
9176099	9178605	She'll say, I'm going to read the first word of each of these emails.
9178625	9180530	This one says, Jamie's the best.
9180550	9181934	This one says, Jamie's the best.
9181954	9183799	This one says, I like Minecraft.
9186647	9188151	This one says, grow your YouTube.
9188231	9188732	Oh, spam.
9189414	9189855	Anyway.
9189987	9192170	This one says, hey, I checked out OLR.
9192210	9193452	No, you didn't, you fucking liar.
9194434	9195675	He's trying to sell us something.
9195695	9196256	I hate those.
9196657	9201124	If you checked out this show, you know you're probably... Yes, and dear.
9201364	9202966	We're contacting you, dear.
9204368	9205510	What?
9205530	9206832	I'm your dear.
9207318	9212768	OG Happy Dude says, nothing is preventing a 24-hour call-in episode or party.
9212889	9219040	I think we all are accepting that that night will probably go late, and that's fine.
9219241	9222567	It's already taken the week off afterwards, so it's all good.
9222587	9225192	Didn't you say you took the next day off, Jamie, that Monday?
9226471	9229234	I don't remember if you said it or not.
9229855	9234801	I probably won't, but again, I'm fortunate in that my boss listens to this program.
9234841	9241249	So if I'm on my Zoom calls wearing sunglasses on Monday, I feel like I'll get a little bit of understanding.
9241269	9247716	24 hours is a lot, but six maybe.
9249578	9250960	We could just drink.
9252745	9262854	SSJ100Matt says, I gotta ask, are we doing one last listless, maybe best gaming moments of the last 23 and a half years?
9264035	9264496	Fuck me.
9264836	9268419	I don't remember the last 23 and a half years.
9268920	9272223	Since you asked so nicely, maybe we will.
9272403	9275446	Maybe we will bring one of the old games back for one last swing.
9276307	9279850	We can't do a cage match because we all know it's going to be Sandstorm.
9280876	9307221	we can't do a cage match because of copyright streaming things on Twitch so unfortunately you're going to have to get that dream I need to stomp out real quick but a listless or a match game we were doing OLR match game before Drag Race was on TV I just want to put that out there it's Holic the ultimate cage match song forever is Holic how about the FUs of the week you don't want me to do an FU
9308753	9327977	because I'm going to admit I have a little bit of feeling I don't voice and yeah alright so last minute stories do we have any last minute stories tonight?
9327997	9332382	I'm gonna just completely go off on the entire industry so you don't want me to say anything
9332851	9336238	Yes, I actually have a few things real quick I was going to mention.
9337621	9339424	So here's a fun one.
9339444	9344394	Did you know that GameStop has their own official game that they're actually selling at GameStop?
9345356	9345938	How to suck?
9347120	9351689	It's called Buck in the Curse Partridge.
9351709	9353152	Did they label this box correctly?
9353493	9353593	Pfft.
9354434	9376088	uh yeah you have the final unwrapped box display boxes that you're gonna sell is new no it's buck remember that stupid rabbit that they have that's like their mascot i guess but they're selling it it's now a game boy color game that someone made for them or they commissioned to have made for them and they sell it at their store so yay um
9376979	9378001	This is kind of cool.
9378081	9385212	There is a mod that was developed for Bully, the old Rockstar game called Bully Online.
9385372	9387155	It is exactly what it sounds like.
9387355	9393966	It is a multiplayer mod for Bully that allows you to play... As if you need a mod to bully people online.
9394106	9394667	Come on.
9394765	9395947	Well, now you can.
9395987	9405439	And yeah, so you can do all sorts of roleplay stuff in the bully game, which until it gets shut down by Rockstar, which I believe will happen.
9406460	9414511	Yes, they they like to be litigious and also they like to bust unions because apparently that's the other thing that they're doing right now in the UK.
9414551	9415272	They fired.
9415252	9443925	30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada that they say they're claiming people were terminated for gross misconduct however also those people happen to be part of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain and this is a basically a way to bust some union so fun fun that's it alrighty
9444479	9448703	Well, with that, we're going to wrap it up, get some final thoughts.
9448723	9451385	We were a little long tonight, but I expect these last episodes will be.
9451925	9467258	Usually at the end, I talk about spread the word and all that stuff, but ever since we made the announcement, I think I just want to say here, a reminder, our last episode is November 23rd, and we want to thank all of you for being along with us on this journey.
9467538	9474064	We got into it a little bit on that call tonight, but you guys have been what has made this show a success for as long as it has been.
9474044	9503494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9503879	9507223	Yeah, we're just hashing out a couple of things, that's all.
9507543	9507923	Awesome.
9507943	9512468	I saw someone working on something, so I know things are happening.
9513649	9522299	Because I was also asked a lighting question, so I know that there's things occurring, and that's exciting to see.
9522319	9525842	So I look forward to the children that will be birthed next.
9529046	9531068	I just don't ask to pay child support.
9531419	9533281	Children.
9533301	9534582	This is like the drunk aunt.
9534862	9537444	All right.
9537545	9538145	Final thoughts.
9538225	9539086	Let's do them.
9539146	9540627	DarkSakura, you're streaming tonight, right?
9540647	9541108	Final thought.
9541488	9545212	Yeah, tonight's Pali and I because, you know, I like to do something chill after the show.
9546413	9551457	But, man, I have some feelings about Debra Delightful here.
9551778	9558844	You know, they're starting 2v8 again and they're taking out Legion for shame.
9560039	9588865	How dare they take out my legion Growl Hiss So Pallia happens tonight Have fun with Pallia Yeah Bye kids Bye, see you next time Alright, we'll go over to Loki Your final thought tonight, Loki My final thought is I need to work more on content Because I've been busy with everything else You'll have some extra time in a few weeks
9589182	9619189	I need to figure out what to do.
9619169	9624515	You know, if I do it all cinematic and it's all scripted, that's kind of a lot of effort.
9624535	9628319	But I also want to play it, you know, so I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to do that.
9629259	9630761	I don't know.
9630781	9632923	I may just not do it fully scripted.
9633083	9638309	The only reason I wanted to do it scripted and cinematic is because I thought that that would get more views.
9638329	9643935	But, you know, based off of what my channel's doing right now, I don't know what gets more views.
9643955	9646818	Obviously, that is not working at all.
9647378	9648079	Nothing to do.
9648532	9651880	We'll figure it out.
9651900	9652601	Keep at it, Loki.
9652622	9656009	You do good stuff and one of these days you'll be rewarded for that success.
9656070	9656491	I know it.
9657192	9657874	Someday.
9658295	9661883	I choose to believe that that is true in my heart.
9662133	9670044	And then my final thought is I see a news article about Civilization 7 scrolling along the bottom of the screen and then I realize I still never played Civilization 7.
9670064	9671105	I should probably get on that.
9671546	9672988	But I need to finish Dragon Quest.
9673088	9675111	I'm playing games like a lot lately.
9675131	9676012	It's that time of year.
9676192	9676773	Exciting.
9676793	9677634	Video games.
9677654	9678055	Yay.
