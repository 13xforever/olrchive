9734	14459	This week, the PlayStation 1's American release turned 30 at... Oh.
14479	15239	Oh, no.
17121	17421	No.
18202	18482	No.
19143	19463	No.
19824	21886	God, no!
21906	30154	How... When... This week, but... But that... No!
30174	35399	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35419	38982	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
41088	46434	Cora, now for Jason, who I think passed away at the realization that the PlayStation is 30 years old.
46714	47255	Hi!
47495	49818	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
49878	51860	Orange Lounge Radio.
52521	63312	My friends on the internet, it is time to jump in and talk about the latest and greatest in video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with me, myself, Rob Roberts, and joined every week.
63573	67517	Welcome back this week to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
68628	69209	Hi.
69229	69569	Hi.
70110	70530	How are you doing?
70550	72332	You had a long stream yesterday.
72372	75776	You played a lot of the video games on the Twitch televisions yesterday.
76998	83506	I did play a lot of the video games yesterday, and my voice is kind of weak.
83526	89092	I'm not as sore as I thought I would be, but my throat hurts a little bit, and it's kind of weak.
89112	89893	But...
90295	91537	I had a great time.
91557	92217	I met my goals.
92498	95061	I want to thank everybody who was there.
96583	97665	I played the Debbies.
98145	99747	I'll get into that later.
99767	100008	All right.
100048	101409	Sounds good.
101489	112063	Going to our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
112243	113485	SSJ100 Matt.
113465	115990	is also naming things to make us feel old today.
116351	122904	The Golden Girls are 40 years old today, premiered at this very hour, Sunday night at 9 o'clock, actually.
123485	125289	So that's pretty incredible.
125389	126672	I remember watching The Golden Girls.
126692	128756	That was one of my mom's favorite TV shows.
128776	130940	We used to watch it together in her bedroom.
131241	134848	We watched it all together on the big cabinet TV in the front room.
134828	142558	I love, though, that like Golden Girls is one of those things that's like priceless, like even like Gen Z. You know, I hate talking in generational terms, but it's true.
142959	146363	Even like Gen Z and stuff like really appreciate the humor in the Golden Girls.
146383	147725	Like that show is just timeless.
147805	148726	It's it's great.
148866	152591	So and Dark Titsia says, well, thank you all for being a friend.
153232	154434	Oh, that's nice of you to say.
154454	155515	And I hope you brought cheesecake.
156316	157978	Anyway, hopefully he brought cheesecake.
158018	160161	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
160647	163351	I have cheesecake cookies in the fridge.
163371	164172	It's not quite the same.
164293	164854	I accept.
166396	169401	Honestly, I can't devour a whole cheesecake.
169441	170522	That's a bit much for me.
170542	172746	So maybe a cheesecake cookie is a good compromise.
173006	175750	And I'll still eat it with a knife and fork to pace myself.
177413	178334	You kind of have to.
178395	179156	They're pretty rich.
179196	180818	Yeah.
180999	186587	And Loki, you're appreciating the Golden Girls at 40 as well?
187028	187288	Sure.
187308	189051	I haven't watched it for a long time.
189470	191132	Your wife watches it though, right?
191753	192574	I thought she did.
192715	193295	Off and on.
193436	194277	I thought she was a big fan.
194918	195238	All right.
195399	197241	Anyway, let's see.
197301	197942	Go into chat.
197982	202909	Now y'all are making age jokes in chat and compliments for Jason on the intro there tonight.
202969	206294	Of course, Jason does great work and has done great work for us for a long time.
206334	214566	So thank you to Jason, our voiceover guy who does our intro for us every week and some of the other special things you see on Twitch when we tape live.
214546	216108	Let's get into gaming news.
216128	217689	We had a pretty big one this week.
217729	228521	Nintendo dropped a Direct on us this week, so quite a bit of news to go through, which is a nice refreshing change for last week when Loki and I were holding down the fort going, we ain't found shit.
228541	230503	Like, there's not a lot happening in gaming.
230523	231745	This is why, probably.
231765	235028	There's just a lot of what the fuckery from what I see.
235209	242977	Yeah, well, this week we've got more, so, and yeah, we're getting into, yeah, there's definitely the, but starting off with mostly good news in the Nintendo Direct.
243097	243878	Loki.
244195	248002	So yeah, apparently they're celebrating Mario's 40th anniversary.
248022	250466	It feels like it's just... Here we go again!
250486	253973	Wasn't it just 30 years, like, yesterday or something?
254033	255095	Well, Mario 35.
255856	257499	Mario 35 was a big deal.
257519	258260	Oh, it was 35.
258501	258661	Okay.
259102	259763	Yeah, okay.
259783	260585	That makes more sense.
260685	262508	I was like, wait, was it 30?
262488	266034	I thought they were going to bring that back.
266415	268098	I really thought they were going to bring that back.
268138	270221	They had the perfect opportunity.
270782	280298	Of course, they could have done Mario 40, but I still would have accepted Mario 35 back for a limited time in celebration of five more years or something.
280338	281741	There's still a way they could have marketed it.
282001	284065	I'm a little sad they didn't do that, but okay, whatever.
284345	286048	We got other stuff instead.
286028	313825	um so like even right before the direct had come out that the new Mario movie was going to be named the Mario Galaxy movie and we got a confirmation of that now so that was the thing that they kind of kicked it off with is you know hey here's a tease of the Super Mario Galaxy movie and didn't really show anything they just confirmed that you know a lot of the voice cast is coming back you know um all the main cast basically for it so cool
314378	317723	And that's supposed to be coming out next spring.
317743	328820	And then along with that, of course, Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are now coming onto the Switch outside of the 3D All-Stars that they did not that long ago.
328860	331844	So they've sold you Mario Galaxy a few times now.
333146	336151	But yeah, that's going to be coming out October 2nd.
336852	343542	No word on really what else they've done to it other than the graphics are slightly better.
344905	369057	I don't know.
369442	372046	An update for Super Mario Bros.
372186	387727	Wonder, they're doing a Nintendo Switch 2 edition that's adding this meetup in Bellabelle Park, which adds some co-op multiplayer stuff, like different game modes there, but no actual single-player additions to that.
387747	391011	And that's supposed to be out spring of 2026.
391345	394652	We have a new Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book.
394692	400083	I just really want to say, I was actually a little unimpressed by what they announced for Mario Wonder.
400103	400844	Yes, I was very unimpressed.
401105	410063	I don't know, and maybe it's just not for me, and that's okay, because I don't really have the family at home the size to take advantage of the minigames.
410043	416732	But I could imagine, you know, some households that, you know, have family night playing Nintendo with, you know, the age appropriate kids and stuff.
417153	418775	Probably you're going to get a big kick out of it.
418795	424162	I just kind of looked at it going, damn, I wish they would have more of the formula that works in the base game.
424182	424422	Right.
424462	428628	But you would think that they would have some sort of metrics that they're able to capture.
428668	429289	Like, I get it.
429309	430110	Like, you know.
430090	438007	Data Privacy and stuff like that but I'm sure that there's some sort of like user metrics that they can capture the show like oh okay well we had Super Mario Bros.
438067	444741	Wonder and here's what percentage of our audience played that you know couch co-op or something like that
445312	448039	I don't imagine that it's a very high number, though.
448099	458183	Like, I mean, I'm sure you get some families that sit down and do that, but I guarantee the majority, the far and away majority of that is going to be just single player.
458504	461571	But then why do these DLCs have more like multiplayer things?
461591	463135	And consider the system as handheld.
463115	465759	It lends itself to single player.
465839	471988	Deft in chat says they said that they were going to add more stuff to the single player game too, but they focused way too much on the multiplayer.
472109	478658	Agree, because something kind of weird that's happening with these Switch 2 upgrades, and I'm talking the non-performance ones.
478678	483065	You know, something like what they did to the Zelda game, those are performance upgrades, right?
483165	484447	So that's different.
484467	490596	But I feel like these non-performance upgrades are these just weird-ass side things that I don't really care for.
490717	492379	Mario Party...
492359	493661	and the Kinect games.
494322	495784	No, it's a hard pass for me.
495804	499509	I'm not really impressed at what they've been developing on that front.
499549	503755	So I think that's why this just felt like another one of those where I was like, meh.
503775	505637	But if they're going to add to the single player, then maybe.
506438	515170	I 100% guarantee, like, because even though Switch 2 just came out, what, six months ago or so, I 100% or actually, no, it wasn't six months ago, three months ago.
515571	517073	Gosh, it hasn't even been that long.
517433	521539	I guarantee by the time that we get around to, uh,
521705	525191	to June of next year, they will have already forgotten about that camera.
525712	527555	It is going to be a thing.
527575	538093	It's going to be one of those features that they completely dump me considering like with even like the 3DS, the 3D part of that, the whole selling gimmick of that system.
538513	541478	They completely toss out the window very shortly afterwards.
541979	544163	I guarantee that camera is going that same route.
544283	546126	I can't imagine that has the staying power.
546106	563068	I have yet to use the camera it's set up because you can use any USB camera so actually the old OLR camera well the in my office before I upgraded to a 4k camera my old 1080 I just hooked up to my switch I still had it and it works great you can see my living room but there's no there's not a lot of
563048	568454	The online camera thing is kind of cute, but I just don't really have the friends who have wanted to play it.
568994	573258	The only thing I've seen people use that for online a little bit is Mario Kart.
573759	578924	And maybe to do a YouTube... Because Mario Kart did actually incorporate it well.
578944	585551	Where it zooms in on the face, and when you knock people out, it kind of captures them looking at their little webcam image.
586011	587593	They do cute Nintendo-y things.
588434	592498	But I feel like all that has been really glossed over.
592478	597765	in favor of the lame Kinect games that are being added to Mario Party.
597785	604533	And I actually think when the add-ons are subtle in that very Nintendo way, it's actually much more powerful than a Kinect game.
605334	616208	Yeah, and on top of that, I'm surprised we still haven't heard anything of all these online tests that they've been doing for some sort of
616795	640997	Mobile Game or MMO type thing like we haven't really heard of anything regarding that but we've got it's got to be out there it's probably just not hitting the mainstream because it is under NDA but it's it's probably out there on Reddit or something yeah uh anyways yeah so yeah underwhelming stuff for Super Mario Brothers Wonder uh Yoshi in the Mysterious Book looks kind of cute um
641348	671187	you know the whole thing is kind of like this quasi stop motion animation looking thing which looks nice I like how they've done some really cool things with like different animation styles between the games so that'll be coming out next spring they showed off a game called Storm Lancers which was a side-scroller platformer game that's available at Solar Couch Co-op that was actually released that day Dinkum which I think is a PC game as well but Dinkum
671892	679703	Yeah, Dinkum is kind of like a, looks like a cross between like an Animal Crossing style game and I think like almost like a Minecraft type thing.
681085	684850	Where you basically kind of build up a town and stuff like that.
684870	688495	But that's going to be launching on the Switch on November 5th.
689016	689997	So that looks kind of fun.
691039	697668	We have PapuCom, which is a multiplayer only third person shooter puzzler.
697888	698769	That one looked neat.
699150	699250	Yeah.
699230	700192	Yeah, it looked neat.
700212	702356	That's going to be coming out this holiday.
702817	709591	We got a new trailer for Tomodachi Life, Living the Dream, where I guess they have weird voices and I kind of love that.
709611	718048	It looks great, which is funny because I really feel like I've been like gaslit into liking the first game more than I actually did.
718028	722793	And I think a lot of that is because of the memes, the constant memes that come out of this.
723173	726897	And I, you know, they showed like a little breaking news sort of segue.
726937	734225	And I was talking with DarkSakura about this before because they have a very similar sort of transition on the DarkSakura channel.
734245	736747	And I was like, oh, it's funny because that was in the Tamodachi Life.
736767	740731	And I'm like, when I saw that in the Tamodachi Life trailer, I was like, oh, this is just meme.
741152	744075	Somebody is going to make that TikTok in Tamodachi.
744175	746297	Watch, the day that...
746277	756634	The day Tamodachi Life releases, go to TikTok, check the tag for Tamodachi Life, and I guarantee you somebody will have made the thing that says, breaking news, you're a cunt.
757896	759178	They're going to do it.
759198	765028	Like, that thing's going to get memed a hundred ways.
766038	767300	Yeah, it's gonna happen.
767400	768962	It looks interesting.
768982	775330	Like, I have to say, it just looks very quirky and strange, which is kind of neat.
775350	784442	I'll tell you what just got me on Tomodachi Life was watching them give somebody a cabbage and have her eat the cabbage and go, yum.
785403	786865	Who eats a cabbage?
788195	789437	Who just eats a whole cabbage.
791179	793162	She's going to have some stinky farts.
793983	798049	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob's to drama's prediction, safe pit.
798510	800373	That's a Miss Cleo prediction.
800493	804959	That's a television magician prediction who has it on the cue cards.
804999	807222	That's not even a prediction.
807563	810167	That's accepting reality.
810187	811148	That's a different...
812528	814231	We can't call that Robstradamus.
814731	817476	That's Rob Shulmato.
817496	818758	That's Rob Shulmato.
818778	820280	Accepting that this is our reality.
821001	827691	What is that clip where they're pouring airplanes on top of their head or something?
827751	828833	I don't even know what that is.
830095	836200	Yeah, Dolly Partner brings back a controversy with the first game.
836541	840284	Dolly Partner says, I hope I can get gay married in this Tomodachi life.
840665	846169	My mom's me married Darren Criss on the 3DS version and I wanted him for myself.
846530	848311	That's such a Dolly Partner thing to say.
848432	851795	I have no idea who you are, but you are so fucking funny, never change.
852996	858841	So that was a thing that happened in the first Tomodachi life.
858881	860102	Remember, it had all the
860082	875188	So you would think all these years later you would hope, and I realize Japan isn't all the way there, but they've made some more strides as, you know, and now we're starting to regress in the U.S., but we're going to hope that worldwide that maybe...
875168	885282	Maybe you can, you know, if they have to compromise and be like, you partner with anybody and they just, you know, obviously I think it should be marriage no matter what.
885623	886444	I mean, my position is clear.
886504	891050	But if there's going to be some compromises made in Tamodachi life, I'm just hoping they get it right this time.
891311	892913	Like, life partner whoever you want.
894055	894375	Yeah.
894963	899869	And then they kind of did a segment where they were showcasing partner games.
899889	903834	So a lot of these we've kind of heard about before that are coming to the Switch 2 and Switch.
904495	911645	Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection is going to be out digitally, I guess, October 30th, physically, December 12th.
912766	917812	Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrate coming to Switch 2 on January 22nd.
918614	919735	I wonder how it's going to run.
920416	922118	I'm...
922098	930133	But those games were on PS4, and no, actually no, the second one wasn't, was it?
931598	933520	The first one was.
933540	935202	So, hmm.
935222	937004	Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how that works.
937845	942930	Linked Banner of the Spark coming out on both platforms.
942950	945052	That was also later that day.
945653	949017	Hades 2, September 25th on Switch and Switch 2.
949277	950338	Kirby Air Riders.
950358	950778	That's good.
951219	953862	The early access has been out for like a year.
953882	954623	There's still things.
954643	958467	Two other partnered things or third-party things I'm super excited about.
958647	958787	Mm-hmm.
959881	975046	Danganronpa 2 with the story expansion Kirby Air Riders they had new Amiibos they also showed off as well for that which I think Amiibos are people still paying attention to Amiibos now?
975387	982699	Yeah but it's obviously not the huge thing it was before but it's interesting they're still pushing them out
983573	985517	Yeah, and that's November 20th.
985938	986860	New trailer for Hyrule Age.
986880	989185	Oh my god, my def says that's a $50 amiibo.
989205	990027	Are you shitting me?
990909	992152	Is that a tariff problem?
992372	994377	Like, why are amiibos $50 now?
994437	995178	Is it giant?
995659	998646	Is it like the giant pop balloons that are like four times the size?
999740	1000401	Oh my god.
1004270	1006675	That's November 20th.
1006755	1011485	Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment had a new trailer that's now coming out.
1011505	1012387	That game looks hot.
1012407	1012848	I like that.
1012868	1013670	Yeah, November 6th.
1014110	1015774	That's a really good Zelda spinoff.
1015794	1017698	I will definitely check this out.
1017982	1036058	Dragon Quest VIII Reimagined
1036038	1058670	and just before you come at me with your pitchfork and torches yes 7 is great I'm glad it's getting a remake you know because we've had you know a lot of the Dragon Quest games getting remade I don't have a problem with it but I was like oh because I'm thinking like it's kind of time for Dragon Quest 12 like how old is Dragon Quest 11 at this point it's several years I'm just kind of surprised it wasn't a Dragon Quest 12 announcement but all right
1059595	1062559	And the thing that you... Well, what is it?
1062579	1065804	They had a small update on the Nintendo Today app, which no one cares about.
1066665	1088758	And then the thing that nobody asked for whatsoever, Virtua Boy Nintendo Classics that are coming to the Switch in 3D thanks to either a $100 piece of plastic that you can plug your Switch 2 into, or Nintendo Switch, I guess,
1089447	1097379	or a cardboard thing which costs like 30 bucks that resembles the Labo virtual reality stuff.
1098141	1101466	But the Labo would only work with the Switch One.
1101486	1103850	Although, technically, I believe Virtual Boy is supposed to work with Switch One.
1104551	1105031	No, thank you.
1105071	1106614	I already have one.
1106634	1107295	A real one.
1107655	1116990	It's like, why... They have this opportunity to basically make something better.
1117477	1129749	And they're like, no, we will keep the original form factor, migraine-inducing and all, and we're just going to give it to you for the same price that it cost when it originally came out.
1130730	1133852	I appreciate the commitment to the bit, if nothing else.
1134093	1139958	Like, it is still value for the plus, you know, and some people might be going, what value?
1140359	1145003	I would like to know if you will be able to play these 2D games
1144983	1145724	on the Switch.
1146045	1147528	And I would like to see a source.
1147628	1151775	And to be fair, I have not gone to the Nintendo official website and looked yet.
1152096	1154961	But I've heard a lot of people saying that the thing is required.
1154981	1161372	But I was taking what they were saying in the direct to mean that the peripherals are required for the 3D visuals.
1161352	1188220	which they were yeah say so and because you know if they don't you know the way things work in this country if they don't say that specifically there'll be a class action lawsuit so say those things are needed for the 3D but can we play the 2D on just without it because I think that would be great um and uh you know but otherwise I as far as the plastic goes I appreciate the commitment to the bit like they didn't go in they went all in
1189128	1191431	Why would anyone want to play anything on it?
1192573	1193654	I agree.
1193694	1195957	The Wario game and the pinball game were fun.
1196418	1199943	Here's my thought process behind it, though.
1200504	1203808	For example, they could have just made a head-mounted display.
1203868	1209836	Not a head-mounted display, but a head-mounted thing that your Switch 2 could plug into or something like that.
1209856	1218308	And then, not only is it usable for this, it is usable for other developers if they would like to develop a game that utilizes this
1218288	1224681	Peripheral, or they could add some of those features back in.
1224701	1236746	Maybe they could even have... I'd probably not Labo support because that was a whole thing, but maybe they could have had some similar stuff like Labo that could have utilized this peripheral now.
1236766	1239672	But now this is a $100...
1239652	1259719	Thanks for watching!
1259699	1261402	but they're going to be scalping it anyways.
1261642	1264006	Also, what makes this thing $100 anyways?
1264287	1269135	It doesn't actually do anything other than have some lenses in it and it's made of plastic.
1269256	1277870	It doesn't actually have any sort of hardware in it that does anything other than it has a tray that sits your Switch console into.
1277931	1280114	Here's what I wish Nintendo would do.
1280675	1281657	Maybe lenses.
1281637	1283481	I don't... Here's what I wish Nintendo would do.
1283601	1285886	And I don't think they will, but I wish they would.
1286427	1292520	Is that if they're gonna go so far as to release this and do all this other stuff, I wish they would let people develop for it.
1292540	1300557	Meaning, like, if people wanna do... And I don't know, I'm assuming maybe there's just not the oomph in there to do, like, a full VR other game.
1300537	1323979	DarkSakura,
1323959	1333362	I understand that it might have the lenses in there and stuff, and it may basically set it up to where it shifts it so that it goes into both your eyes.
1333949	1339136	However, they put the red tint of the glass on there anyways.
1339557	1346687	So now everything's going to be monochrome red, even if they decided later on down the road that, oh, hey, someone else can develop something for this that uses this device.
1347028	1351013	Whatever it's developed now, it's going to be monochrome red because they put that crap in there.
1351534	1355620	I wonder if that's how they're getting around the headache issue, though.
1357591	1361276	But the headache thing, I think, also comes from the refresh on that.
1361576	1365441	Obviously, the screen probably refreshes faster than the old system did.
1366002	1366523	I don't know.
1366603	1371730	But the form factor is awful, too, because you have to bend down to use it.
1372371	1373572	Just strap it to your head.
1373672	1375254	I don't understand what the problem is.
1376116	1377878	But, eh, whatever.
1377998	1379881	I mean, it's whatever they're going to do with it.
1380942	1385488	It seems like it's just going to be a thing that gets not utilized whatsoever.
1385924	1390508	Well, I mean, Bobby does make a decent point in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1390528	1392790	Bobby says, we want game preservation.
1393231	1394211	No, not like that.
1395993	1400017	Again, I appreciate the commitment to the bit, if nothing else, from Nintendo.
1400037	1403360	Like, putting out the plastic thing is actually pretty ballsy.
1403580	1405041	It should be half the price.
1405141	1409986	Because if the cardboard thing is $25, where do you get the extra $75?
1410766	1411867	It's not in the plastic.
1412148	1413529	There's hardly anything on there.
1413549	1414750	Well, you got a little bit of metal.
1415651	1415931	Huh?
1417835	1439353	Um, I...
1439688	1460363	I again I hope that it plays 2D I'm just not really interested in commit like I think as much as I say the commitment to the bit is neat I don't know if I realistically see myself wanting to play the video games like this like you used to do with the Virtual Boy like I would just like to be able to play it 2D but I don't know we'll see we'll see what happens so
1462503	1468230	um let's see uh and Bobby says they don't manufacture them in the U.S.
1468410	1484089	Def says the thing says made in China don't know if it's actually made in China but maybe um so I can't imagine the markup being that high like I just realistically when you okay no I get 25 I mean the cardboard is 25 dollars
1484069	1484690	Right, exactly.
1485090	1493061	You're telling me that this thing is more expensive to manufacture than the controllers that you use on the game console.
1493522	1494263	Almost $100.
1494684	1496326	Those are $90 now.
1496786	1499530	I understand that, but that's even less expensive.
1499610	1501693	And there's no hardware inside this.
1501713	1503235	It's all a plastic shell.
1503796	1506540	You cannot tell me that is more expensive to manufacture.
1506780	1507361	I'm sorry.
1507501	1509604	I don't buy it.
1510327	1527964	and also don't buy it because it's bad alright, I'm telling you they'll sell out, they'll be impossible to find I mean, yeah, if I put up two for sale that's how Nintendo collectibles go the end of it is that people there will be people who will buy it
1528450	1547455	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1547435	1552463	People are going to buy this because growing up they were told they can't have one or they couldn't have one.
1552944	1559655	I think that's huge for people because I got to be honest, if I end up getting one of these things, it is exactly that reason why.
1559675	1563562	I will be buying it because I couldn't have one growing up.
1563882	1569392	The Bride Guys Gaming in chat says, I'm buying it because I've been wanting a Virtual Boy and I've been hunting for years.
1569912	1570894	I do want to...
1572325	1577653	I want to reply to Rinmari who said people shouldn't buy this Virtual Boy nonsense in the same way people shouldn't buy Hogwarts Legacy.
1577673	1578875	The two have nothing to do with each other.
1579255	1580197	Nothing to do with each other.
1583021	1587808	I would need more information on that because on its text it sounds like a real reach.
1587848	1595920	It's one thing about supporting a turf and then just supporting Nintendo's business decision.
1596080	1596821	Two or two different things.
1597061	1601708	I will say Rinmari's comment above caught my eye and I think this is...
1602245	1607012	A very interesting point, saying can't wait for someone to 3D print this for cheaper.
1607032	1612059	That's a very interesting point, actually, and I think one that ought to be considered.
1612079	1626379	I wonder, though, if these games can't be played in 2D, if there's some little, little thing, little dock, little switch, little chip, and baby little chip in this thing that is necessary for the whole damn thing to work.
1626528	1629892	That'll also be figured out.
1629932	1630713	That won't be hard.
1630834	1632275	Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.
1632295	1636761	I can already squash that because, no, it's not because they have a cardboard thing that they're making.
1636941	1639585	So, like, no, it does not require that.
1639925	1643890	I bet, if anything, it's like the Amiibo technology.
1643910	1647055	But Jamie's right that it'll get cloned immediately.
1647075	1647715	It is.
1647735	1651320	I mean, it is not that because they're not going to put that kind of...
1651621	1658190	It's just a cardboard or plastic thing that you just slide your device into that looks like Virtual Boy.
1658550	1659732	That's all it is.
1659992	1670907	This has a little bit more hardware on it because it's got a couple pieces of metal for the stand and the adjustment clip or whatever to make it less headache-inducing, but still headache-inducing.
1671368	1676755	Anyways, yeah, we could complain about the Virtual Boy all day long, but we have more stuff to talk about.
1676775	1677496	We're on our way.
1678397	1678898	All right.
1679338	1681341	I found the patent from last year.
1683076	1693495	There was a patent approved in September that provided an update for Nintendo's patent for a goggle apparatus including a display section that was post-Labo.
1694156	1697763	So I am going to pull... Oh, it doesn't want to load up for me.
1697823	1699366	Thank you, government website.
1699987	1702852	But I'm going to see if I can find the patent and see what it has about it.
1703493	1704375	Alright, well anyway...
1705132	1711441	Anyways, we had Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly Remake announced for Switch 2.
1711461	1712963	It's coming in early 2026.
1713984	1715766	They showed off some more partner games.
1716067	1719271	One Piece Pirate Warriors 4, which is coming in this fall.
1720212	1722856	Overcooked 2, this holiday.
1722956	1727082	Stardew Valley is going to be getting a port to Switch 2 this fall.
1727763	1732489	And Human Fall Flat Nintendo Switch 2 Edition coming in the spring.
1732469	1736177	as well as Power Wash Simulator 2 this fall.
1736317	1737059	That's exciting.
1738642	1742570	Suica Game Planet which is arriving.
1742731	1743773	Suica Game is great.
1744294	1746799	I've played that thing religiously on my phone.
1746965	1751093	Sweet Good Game Planet, yep, coming to Switch and Switch 2 this winter.
1752114	1759027	And then the weirdest look at Metroid Prime 4, it is apparently looking very open world.
1759548	1763135	And in Nintendo fashion, everybody gets a motorcycle.
1763535	1769867	And so Samus is getting a futuristic motorcycle because, you know, not to be outdone by Mario and Link.
1769847	1772251	Great to me.
1772672	1776698	That Tron looks more interesting than the movie that's coming, so I'll take it.
1776879	1779223	Metroid Prime 4 looks hot.
1779243	1784852	And we have a date, a release date, December 4th on the Switch and Switch 2.
1784933	1786615	Switch and Switch 2.
1787115	1788036	It was always planned that way.
1788437	1788977	That's not new.
1789018	1789798	That's not new news.
1789818	1794183	Yeah, they said that because there's yeah, there's probably going to be an upgrade and all that stuff.
1794223	1798288	But anyway, I yeah, of course, I'll be buying it as a Metroid fan.
1798348	1802593	But I I think the December target is super interesting.
1803013	1805856	I think a lot of people were thinking it would get pushed to next year.
1805876	1808719	And you don't often see games released in December.
1809260	1811042	So but I think
1811022	1812163	They've done that before.
1812203	1813485	I think Nintendo is betting.
1813525	1818871	They have done it before because it wasn't Smash when they did it on Switch.
1818891	1820874	There was something big they released in December.
1820954	1822596	But anyway, I digress.
1822696	1824458	I think they're just betting on it doesn't matter.
1824478	1825319	And they're probably right.
1825459	1829063	It doesn't matter, especially in this age of buying a lot of games digitally and things like that.
1829083	1829624	It doesn't matter.
1830044	1831806	The game's still going to sell in December.
1833108	1838194	But they're really taking the most time they can because you know they want to put that out
1838866	1862539	If they can, Thanksgiving week So they need every week, they're making it all count Yeah, we've got, they announced some Donkey Kong Bonanza DLC DK Island and Emerald Rush Which is coming out, well came out today Thank you, Death Says, Smash Ultimate was early December 2017 Was it?
1862559	1865042	Okay I thought that was a December release, okay
1865933	1867135	Okay.
1867155	1867655	Interesting.
1868336	1869277	This one looked interesting.
1869357	1871761	Pokemon Pokopia?
1871981	1872522	On the DLC.
1872542	1874624	Sorry, I don't mean to take you back, but I do.
1875666	1882554	Somebody said in chat, and sorry, the comment long scrolled away, but somebody had said they were surprised that there was not a Mario Kart DLC.
1883376	1886059	And even though we had this, there was no Mario Kart World DLC.
1886079	1888362	And I gotta say, I agree with that comment.
1888522	1894590	I was actually surprised with all these other DLCs we're seeing that there isn't one for Mario Kart yet.
1894570	1896734	Probably because I think it's not waiting yet.
1897155	1904448	A lot of that stuff they probably develop and then hold off until the interest in the game starts dipping and then they release it.
1904468	1912883	I think you could be right that they are intentionally timing that after the holiday because they figure a lot of Switch 2s are going to show up
1912863	1916828	as holiday presents, you know, or what have you in December.
1917269	1921595	And then, you know, many of them are going to come with that game bundled or buy it separately.
1921615	1925801	And then maybe a good time to target the first DLC is going to be February or March.
1926542	1931008	Although we did still see spring content in this direct, but I'm sure there'll be another direct in the future.
1931389	1933652	Maybe they'll end up shadow dropping DLC or something.
1933672	1934373	Who knows?
1934393	1935394	But I will admit.
1935374	1953332	Yeah, yeah.
1953616	1957921	So anyways, that game, Pokemon Copia, looked kind of strange.
1957962	1964890	You play as a ditto disguised as a human and you build like a paradise.
1964910	1967894	It almost looks a little bit like Animal Crossing in that sense.
1967914	1969676	Lethal Art style kind of resembles that.
1969696	1973301	I think a lot of people were saying Minecraft, but I would say Dragon Quest Builders.
1973321	1975944	This looks like Pokemon Dragon Quest Builders 100%.
1977346	1981952	Yeah, so it looks interesting in that sense, but it is a...
1982101	1999063	and DarkSakura.
1999043	2003013	I think the two games will coexist safely.
2003033	2004056	I plan on owning both.
2004638	2007966	I think just like multiple fighting games can sort of exist.
2008007	2011596	You can have Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and Tekken and people buy it.
2012037	2014263	I think there's room for it.
2014283	2014624	I do.
2014644	2015787	But maybe...
2015767	2035986	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2036202	2044194	Yeah, I'm sure if it threatens Mario Kart, they'll just patent Karts in video games and then they can sue them into oblivion.
2045095	2047519	Alright, anyway, sorry Loki, I keep interrupting, but chat's got some good stuff.
2048300	2048641	That's alright.
2049262	2058636	Pokemon Legends EA, they showed off a little bit more of the game, and of course it's going to be coming out October 16th on both the Switch and Switch 2.
2059437	2063323	Along with that, they announced DLC for the game.
2064468	2066010	Even though the game's not out yet.
2067552	2068934	So it's Mega Dimension.
2069255	2072179	I'm not as super bothered by that as other people are.
2072600	2078008	And I think one thing to consider with that, the original Pokemon Legends never had DLC.
2078108	2080111	And it probably should have.
2080391	2087562	So I think part of why they're saying this ahead of time is to let people know, yeah, we're going to have more DLC for this.
2087582	2089945	There's going to be more to it than just the game.
2090125	2091407	This is going to be an investment.
2091427	2092028	And I...
2093054	2109274	I, I,
2109254	2112539	I don't have the problem with this, a lot of people seem to.
2112559	2117808	I like seeing that roadmap that the company believes in the game enough to do this.
2118188	2124438	That being said, because somebody dig up the clip of me shading Ubisoft for doing the same thing.
2124458	2126502	Are they still selling it as two different games?
2127243	2128665	Like Pokemon Z and Pokemon A?
2129326	2131009	No, Pokemon Legends is one game.
2131478	2134661	Okay, just making sure, because I know that's another reason.
2135122	2140287	True, that's been a mainstay of the Pokemon, but yeah, I get why that's irritating.
2140307	2143470	But no, Legends is one game, and it still is.
2143751	2148956	But anyway, before somebody goes back and pulls the clip of me shading Ubisoft for doing the same thing, I want to get their games.
2149537	2155663	It's different when the DLC feels mandatory to the story of the main game.
2155643	2178647	and so on.
2178627	2196130	Nintendo has a pretty darn good track record with DLC I'm not super bothered by this I'm actually glad they're committed to Legends and I just hope the game is as good as I think it's going to be because Legends Arceus is my favorite Pokemon game okay all right
2196380	2207160	And then transitioning from Pokemon, we can talk about one game that Jamie's interested in, Danganronpa 2x2, Goodbye Despair.
2207841	2209684	It's going to be coming to the Switch next year.
2212910	2219282	Dynasty Warriors Origins Switch 2 release and DLC was announced for January 22nd.
2219785	2238807	Monster Hunter Story 3 Twisted Reflection 2 Point Museum Disgaea 7 Complete
2238787	2248841	EA Sports FC25, Virtua Fighter 2 Revo, World Stage, LEGO Voyagers, Little Nightmares 3, and Persona 3 Reload.
2248861	2252546	All of those due out in the next month or two.
2254128	2255750	And let's see what else.
2255830	2265283	Resident Evil Requiem is going to be coming to the Switch 2 February 27th, in case you were wondering that, as well as...
2265652	2292081	Resident Evil 7 and 8 will be out as well the same day and then they ended the whole direct with a Fire Emblem game Fire Emblem Fortunes Weave coming in 2026 I wish I was more into the Fire Emblem games than I actually am I am not into the Fire Emblem games I'm just not a big fan of those tactical games but except Final Fantasy Tactics
2292348	2319064	and that one's coming out real soon too I don't know maybe I need to stop being stubborn and try a Fire Emblem game for once but with all the other things I'm interested in in this direct I don't feel like Fire Emblem is one that's going to get my pre-order but I'm really like I understand just because I don't play it doesn't mean it's a bad game other people I'm sure are thrilled about this because I don't think there's been a new Fire Emblem game in a bit so I'm happy for them I think it's great
2319044	2323178	and it's nice to see what the new Smash characters will be when they make a new Smash game.
2324161	2328355	So if I may wind us a little bit back to the Virtual Boy.
2328516	2329138	Sure.
2330047	2339858	I looked at the patent, and there's supposed to be some sort of chipset involved on this device.
2340079	2347187	It doesn't explain the cardboard one, but I just wanted to say that they're listing, like, viewing the TV with it.
2347207	2353354	So apparently this has been through some iterations, but it's got some chip processing in it, looking at the flowchart.
2353840	2360029	Maybe at one point they were thinking of re-releasing it standalone like an NES classic or something.
2360530	2364015	One of the images have them using the device and looking at the TV.
2366119	2370465	And Deft is correcting me to say that there was a Fire Emblem Engage in 2023.
2371106	2372188	I thought it had been longer than that.
2372208	2372568	My bad.
2374632	2379098	Yeah, and with the patent thing, I know that they showed it in the trailer.
2379199	2382143	It didn't look like that there was any...
2382410	2385314	sort of thing it was plugging into, but I don't know.
2387416	2387517	Yeah.
2387537	2394025	I would be shocked if there was any hardware built into that device because there's really no need to have that.
2394486	2399993	Also, now the controllers are they didn't even release the Virtual Boy controller that goes along with that.
2400013	2403257	That should be included for the $100 if I'm going to be paying that.
2403277	2406802	But, you know, I guess we can use the Joy-Cons.
2406982	2408484	That's a good point.
2408504	2410907	Where's the controller for this?
2410987	2411067	Hmm.
2411182	2412284	There is no controller.
2412304	2415911	I'm sure they're going to charge you another $80 for that.
2415931	2422983	Well, that is the last patent I can see on there that was filed by the inventors.
2423044	2423745	Wait, wait, wait.
2423905	2425528	One for August 19th.
2427230	2428853	This year.
2428913	2430937	I'm going to keep digging in this.
2430977	2431598	I'll tell you more.
2432219	2438571	Display device comprising a peripheral circuit having a transistor and black matrix including an opening and peripheral area.
2439032	2441637	Yeah, they're doing more.
2442258	2442859	Their stuff.
2442839	2449729	Well, we have more on patents and Nintendo coming up in a little bit because there's another big story some of you are probably thinking of.
2450149	2451171	We'll get to that in a minute.
2451471	2453334	But first, I do want to get to our gaming weeks.
2453374	2457179	However, on the directs, how did you feel about it overall?
2458882	2460444	Loki, I know you kind of followed it all.
2460464	2462427	What did you think overall?
2462447	2463328	It was okay.
2465553	2473306	Okay, I'm going to tell you right now, Jamie, just drop any sort of illusion that there's something plugged into.
2474007	2481920	So the way that the Switch 2 sits in there, it sits with the bottom sagging out of the bottom.
2481961	2483563	There's nothing that plugs into it.
2483583	2485927	It is just plastic.
2485947	2487410	You can see it in the video.
2487510	2489533	Then I don't think it's worth it.
2489553	2490615	Wait for 3D print.
2491810	2492872	Yeah, 3D print.
2492892	2496056	That's going to be interesting how that changes it.
2496076	2496357	All right.
2497398	2500603	As far as what I felt about the Direct, I thought it was fine.
2500623	2503467	I thought there was a little something for everybody.
2503808	2508975	I did feel, you know, there are some games I just was not as actively interested in as others.
2508995	2514463	I'm glad to see what sort of their celebration of Mario 40th anniversary looks like.
2515004	2518930	As much as I love Galaxy, I'm not paying $70 for those games again.
2519951	2521193	So but that
2521173	2522815	That's neat that that's happening in the movie.
2522835	2523996	It will probably be pretty good.
2524016	2525378	So, yeah.
2525858	2531124	But I think there were definitely things in there I wasn't expecting, like the Pocopia, that caught my attention.
2531224	2532485	I was like, oh, this looks like it'll be fun.
2533086	2538712	So I feel fine and secure in my Switch 2 investment.
2538732	2540514	And that's, I guess, what a direct is supposed to do.
2541856	2542116	All right.
2542736	2547362	Let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2547382	2548743	So, DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2548783	2549644	How was your gaming week?
2550637	2553782	I'm pretty busy, honestly, all things considered.
2554803	2560471	I've been getting back into Avatar, Frontiers of Pandora.
2560491	2561593	I've really been enjoying that.
2564137	2568843	I have been playing, of course, a lot of Dead by Daylight.
2568903	2570866	I went for my Dracula adept last night.
2570966	2572769	I hated the first game I played.
2572829	2574872	It got better as I went on, but he's no pig.
2575898	2599898	I also played Mass Effect 3 again and beat the game last night while I was half falling out of my chair of course, Palia, Suika game I play on my phone that's about it right now Loki, how was your gaming week?
2600468	2601689	It's just Minecraft.
2601709	2607095	I was finishing up updates to my arena, the Slumber Dome.
2607275	2609978	Added a bunch of features to that.
2610398	2611620	Pushed those out the other day.
2612040	2619908	And then I'm trying to go through and record stuff for a new episode to just put something out there.
2620048	2623832	And then I need to render my livestreams.
2623852	2628417	Because I did some livestreams over on my birthday and then
2628397	2631320	I saw that stream on your birthday, and by the way, happy birthday.
2631520	2632702	Thank you.
2633142	2643774	So I did that, and then I was going to do some more on Friday, but then I ended up not doing that because I was going to get sidetracked with I think more updates to the actual Slumber Dome stuff.
2644354	2646297	But yeah, it's in a pretty good spot now.
2646317	2651282	So hopefully we'll get more worked on that pretty soon and move on to other things.
2652308	2657716	My gimme week was, you know, I'm still on this Final Fantasy XI rabbit hole hard.
2658117	2661703	I was playing Horizon, and let me tell you how bad this has gotten now.
2661803	2669575	I got a little irritated because I was trying to figure out ways to make gil, and I decided to get into fishing, and I bought a 10,000 gil fishing rod.
2669555	2697587	and I ended up breaking it because I didn't like read all the fine print because some of the online FAQs are so old they're not very good and it wasn't warning me that if you see that you're about to capture a big fish you need to cancel or you might break this thing I got really frustrated so I was like we're we're fighting right now I'm not playing Horizon for a minute because I'm just frustrated but then meanwhile my friends some of my other friends when I started talking about Final Fantasy 11 they signed up for a different private server called Cat's Eye
2697567	2727574	and they've been trying to get me to go over there and I'm like no I don't want to because I'm I'm really invested in this horizon thing and the achievements and stuff I'm gonna I'm gonna just kind of stick over here I'm really enjoying the game but then because now I'm fighting a little bit through no fault of the server uh because I I got frustrated where my character was at I decided to go um take a peek at this cat's eye and I downloaded it so now I have a full second install of Final Fantasy 11 to check out this other private server but it's a very different experience because it's it's fucking like
2727554	2729837	Final Fantasy XI on crack.
2729878	2732782	The XP gains are like 10 times what you would get normally.
2733102	2734404	That's the one I think I played on.
2735085	2736828	That's like playing Ragnarok Online.
2737149	2747284	Instead of being a 75 era server, it's still a 75 server, but it's on the Rhapsodies expansion, which means it has the trusts
2747264	2755817	It has the Records of Eminence thing where you can XP grind so fucking easy and the book burning and all that stuff.
2756137	2760584	I'm like, oh my god, I barely played and I'm already level 18 on my character.
2760624	2763328	I'm ready to go get sub job items and I'm barely out of Gustaburg.
2763548	2766492	It's just wild.
2766652	2770198	But it's nice that I have that to play with my friends when they want to play.
2770578	2773703	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, Cat's Eye sounds erotic.
2773723	2774864	I'm making a DDR joke.
2775585	2776647	Yeah, I...
2776627	2778469	Laughed at the same coincidence there.
2778509	2784176	And as I was logging in, I was going like, Haunted by a cat's eye.
2784257	2785398	Anyway.
2786900	2787561	So I've been playing that.
2788181	2791946	But I've also, so I got a little thing for my Steam Deck.
2792006	2796632	I finally got a dock for my Steam Deck so I could hook it up to my TV downstairs.
2796652	2799816	So I now have my little emulator deck there.
2799796	2804666	Night Game?
2805688	2817552	Night Game?
2818409	2847555	I have that game yeah that's a and that's a collector's item right because they didn't make a ton of them uh if I remember right so and I forgot yeah I think it goes for quite a bit I thought I forgot Cody and Guy are in that game and Hager like they have all three in that one because obviously the Super Nintendo one was kind of infamous because they cut Guy who was in the arcade release and then years later they did this whole separate I think it was a blockbuster exclusive blockbuster exclusive yeah called Final Fight Guy and
2847535	2862793	I have that too
2863263	2864405	But at least I played it.
2864486	2864846	It's cute.
2865227	2865949	So that's a highlight.
2865969	2867592	I play a variety of old NES games.
2867933	2872383	And now I'm like, okay, I got to get my Game Boy Advance games on there, my Game Boy games so I can play like Revenge of the Gator.
2872744	2874648	And everything is hooked up to retro achievements.
2874848	2875730	So that's kind of fun.
2876392	2878456	It's fun.
2878476	2879398	It's cute.
2879530	2882113	Uh, otherwise I've been playing my mobile games too.
2882434	2884216	There was a lot going on in the mobile games today.
2885477	2895810	Uh, I grinded out a million AP in Ingress because I stupidly recursed a couple weeks ago and I need to get back to where I was at because I miss the XM tank that comes with level 16.
2895830	2899435	Um, and then Pokemon Go had a community day today.
2899775	2901397	So I was just Bluetooth catching through that.
2901477	2903540	I think I caught maybe 10 shinies.
2903680	2904441	I don't know.
2904421	2933466	and then Pikmin had a community day so I had to walk 10,000 steps today in Pikmin so I was multitasking all the games on the mobile front today but it was a good excuse to get some laps in downtown and get a lot of steps in so can't complain alright let's get into some more I have breaking news Ragnarok Online 3 is in beta right now
2934188	2935291	And I'm just signing up for it.
2935431	2936012	Heal, please.
2937756	2938097	Heal, please.
2938598	2939180	Pront, please.
2939260	2939821	Pront, please.
2939902	2940443	Warp, pront.
2941225	2941465	Anyway.
2941906	2942327	Warp, pront.
2944432	2945034	Let's move on.
2945054	2946938	Let's get into some gaming news.
2947379	2949965	So, funny enough, we brought up patents earlier.
2950166	2951910	This is a big one on the Nintendo front.
2953325	2965970	Yeah, so we've talked about Pokemon patents in the past when we were talking about the whole Power World lawsuit thing and how they were trying to go after like patented gameplay stuff.
2966050	2968736	And we said, oh, yeah, that's stupid.
2968796	2971080	That shouldn't be patentable.
2971100	2974928	But hey, it's in Japan, so their rules are different and stuff.
2974908	2977032	Well, look at that.
2977053	2987495	It wasn't that long, and already our broken patent system here in the United States has jumped in and said, hold my beer, we're going to also break some patents and do stupid things.
2987515	2994790	I'm going to just enhance what you said a little bit and say our broken government here in the United States, which includes the patent system.
2994770	3020963	and so on.
3020943	3024088	are available that feature that type of thing.
3024829	3036887	And clearly there are many examples of not only Nintendo games, but also other games that have had something where you summon a character to fight another character.
3036907	3039511	Digimon would be a pretty good example that comes to mind.
3039531	3042876	Digimon, Final Fantasy 3.
3043097	3045400	Doesn't Digimon predate Pokemon 2?
3045420	3045921	Digi...
3046525	3049750	Digimon also doesn't use like a summoning thing.
3049830	3051192	They just hang out with you.
3052654	3054858	Right, but it doesn't matter though.
3054878	3059765	But the fact that they were able to, you know, patent that is just stupid.
3059845	3061087	And you know what that's going to be used for?
3061107	3063832	It's going to be used to attack Power World.
3064252	3068719	Or it's going to be used to attack anybody else that decides to make a game that is stupid.
3068699	3074005	That's what I'm really worried about the indies and Nintendo's overly litigious.
3074306	3082916	But like, okay, so I gave an example of playing Final Fantasy XI and now in that newer version you summon trusts to go out and do things.
3082936	3087221	And that makes me think of like even the older Final Fantasy games summoning Shiva to do.
3087622	3092247	So like there's other AAA companies that are going to be impacted by this.
3092388	3094470	So I don't see Nintendo –
3094450	3096072	Getting to hang on to this.
3096132	3102139	If Nintendo takes one step in the wrong direction and sues the wrong company, it's over for you hoes.
3102159	3103661	I believe is the phrase.
3103741	3111790	Hey, if we're just letting people patent all sorts of things, let's just come up with a bunch of patents that are all Nintendo gameplay.
3112391	3116876	And we'll just go patent all of them since obviously it doesn't matter if previous works are a thing.
3117097	3118298	So we're just...
3118278	3120804	Throwing those rules out the window, then I'll go see Nintendo.
3120824	3121244	How about that?
3121265	3121786	We'll do that.
3121986	3122467	That'll be fun.
3122587	3134473	It's so messy, but I'm sure I'm, you know, and maybe I'm wrong, but I'm probably not, is that this is probably due to less employees at the patent office.
3134894	3135696	I wonder why.
3137583	3146851	Well, less employees should mean that the process takes longer to get through rather than speeding it up and doing a crappy job about it.
3146871	3147352	I don't know.
3147472	3147992	Whatever.
3148012	3153257	But it's just going to be stupid because clearly there are prior works.
3153738	3156480	I think that this patent should be nullified.
3156740	3162666	It is going to take probably a lawsuit by probably the Power World folks to be able to do that or somebody else to do that.
3162966	3167590	Maybe if they ever try to sue somebody over this patent,
3167570	3176989	All your copies of Magic Pen Gel about to spike in value.
3177543	3179085	That game is now illegal.
3179765	3181087	Should have never been awarded.
3181527	3185752	It's just disgusting to see that this type of stuff is allowed to happen.
3186293	3187514	I mean, that's the thing.
3187574	3196124	If Nintendo didn't make great games, I think they wouldn't be getting as much of a pass from people as they do on a lot of their business practices in general.
3196544	3206115	They make a lot of bad business practices as far as harassing other companies and being extremely litigious over things that are just ridiculous like
3206095	3214510	Making YouTube videos on their content or developing a game that has similar mechanics but is not copying their game.
3214530	3218657	They should have gone after Palworld for the trademarks, not the copyright.
3218797	3221542	I think the lawsuit with Palworld is going to get this shut down.
3221582	3228694	But again, I said what I said earlier, if they take a step in the wrong direction and try to go after the wrong company, they're going to lose that patent real fast.
3229535	3230857	All right.
3230877	3232760	Well, let's talk about what's going on.
3232780	3240193	I was going to mention one more thing, too, like other like trash that they announced also during the direct.
3240213	3244880	What was the thing with the flower from Super Mario Wonder?
3245221	3246904	Like this thing that just randomly.
3246924	3249608	Yeah, the physical the physical thing.
3249668	3250750	The yeah.
3250730	3252533	It just shouts random lines.
3252553	3254076	I want that thing to read me.
3254096	3255358	I want that thing to roast me.
3255378	3260447	If I'm going to buy a flower like that, I want it to roast me in the morning when I'm trying to get up.
3260527	3265436	It should combo with Alarmo and it should wake me up by reading me to filth.
3266397	3267639	Get up, dumbass.
3267659	3268441	Yeah, exactly.
3269803	3272868	You better get out of that bed, fatso, or you're going to break it again.
3273309	3274932	Like, you know.
3276650	3277613	Yeah, that's how it should be.
3279720	3280583	Maybe that's why.
3280603	3281025	You know what?
3281105	3283915	I'm going to patent a device right now.
3283935	3286744	A device that roasts your ass to get out of bed.
3289188	3289989	All right, anyway.
3291370	3297957	But nothing too naughty in that roasting, or I might get shut down by the new Sony PlayStation Family app.
3297977	3305725	So Nintendo and Microsoft have had versions of parental controls through an app for quite a long time, but PlayStation is kind of finally getting on the bandwagon.
3306426	3313794	It's an app called the PlayStation Family app, and it allows you to do the parental controls through the app similar to what you do on the console.
3313814	3316056	But there are some extra things as well.
3316036	3321223	There is an onboarding process in case you are unaware of the features of the app and what you can do with it.
3321644	3325189	And then you can also look at playtime limits.
3325209	3327292	You can view activity reports.
3327793	3333241	So if the kiddos are sneaking on that PlayStation late at night, your PlayStation will now rat you out through this app.
3334022	3335624	It can also manage spending.
3335644	3338949	So you can set a budget and all that and create content filters.
3338969	3343275	You can also configure privacy settings for social features.
3343255	3348585	Also through the app, you can get real-time notifications of what your kid is playing.
3349026	3357441	You can also approve or deny requests from kids for extra playtime or restricted game access within the app.
3357481	3362210	So that might be a thing like, you know, if you do your homework, you get an extra 30 minutes.
3362351	3364234	I don't know how...
3364214	3366737	Me managing children couldn't be me.
3367317	3369440	And my cats don't play PlayStation.
3369520	3370761	So I'm scot-free.
3370781	3378970	But I do think, obviously, all joking aside, I think this is a great thing for parents to be able to actively participate in what their kids are doing.
3379450	3380331	So this is great.
3380491	3383375	And the Xbox One is only five years old at this point.
3383715	3390282	And the Nintendo One goes all the way back to, I think, 2017 or 2016 when the Switch first came out.
3390302	3394086	So nice of PlayStation to be here, but we'll...
3394066	3394964	we'll do that
3395618	3396599	Let's see.
3397280	3399543	I'm reading now some of the comments.
3400024	3403209	TigerClaw says, it'll be like, Rob, Rob, wake up, time to get to work.
3403489	3406413	And PodCulture follows that up with, Rob, coffee.
3406794	3408816	That's, yes, accurate, accurate.
3410158	3413823	DJ Ranma S says, the Rob Roberts roaster, get roasted, but fabulously.
3413843	3415265	It doesn't have to be me.
3415806	3417509	I feel it should be plug and play.
3417529	3424258	I think there's a lot of people that would like to get roasted by DarkSakura, and DarkSakura is happy to do some roasting.
3425217	3429034	And I have more of a voice, sure.
3430617	3435124	Uh, let's see, uh, PodCulture says they are Xbox kitties?
3435565	3439110	I don't know if my cats... Actually, my cats are retro kitties.
3439130	3454354	I tell you, when I started playing Gradius, I was playing Gradius 3, actually, specifically, earlier this week on Super Nintendo, Oreo took a great interest into what was going on on the television screen in Gradius 3, because he probably sees the Vic Viper as a fucking bird.
3454814	3455916	Like, my cats...
3455896	3457398	My cats aren't smart.
3457579	3459121	They're cute, but they're not smart.
3459241	3460863	So he probably thinks the Vic Viper's a bird.
3462606	3462806	All right.
3462826	3467033	Yeah, DJ Ranma S says the Loki roaster module is just Loki roasting Nintendo.
3469216	3470258	It doesn't roast you.
3470698	3471860	It roasts Nintendo.
3472421	3477128	Like, you better get out of bed before Nintendo trademarks the process.
3477327	3480412	There's a lot of things like we roast the things we love.
3480432	3481273	You should talk.
3481293	3483818	You should hear the complaints we have or I have.
3483858	3491530	Well, not only me, but like other people that I play with about Mojang and Minecraft and stuff and just like the dumb things that they do with that.
3491590	3492111	That is true.
3492131	3495136	I could go on for days and I do usually.
3496919	3497259	All right.
3498161	3500044	What do we have next, Loki?
3500345	3504693	Oh, we have, you know, games being games.
3504733	3513109	Borderlands 4 just released and, you know, usually I'd be really on board to like pick it up and check it out because I'm a huge Borderlands fan.
3513250	3521425	However, I decided to wait because there's a lot of issues.
3521540	3524724	A lot of people are saying that there's issues with the performance of the game.
3524784	3529489	That Unreal 5 is being trash and the game is crashing.
3529549	3530831	It's poorly optimized.
3531732	3542525	It's doing all sorts of things regarding just having the top-end hardware and it's still running like absolute garbage.
3542565	3546349	They've put out, I think, 2K put out a...
3546970	3561430	A guide on how to get the settings that they recommend that you run it in, depending on what your hardware is and your GPU and whatever screen size you have.
3562932	3563273	I don't know.
3563293	3565536	A lot of the recommendations have been just run it in low.
3566117	3571043	I mean, that's kind of pathetic, though, if you can't even run this in top-tier hardware.
3571885	3572185	But...
3573785	3589127	I don't know console I think is not such a problem it's more on the PC side but you know bad PC ports are still not worth it so I'm just gonna wait until they fix their issues also I don't know anything about this game
3589310	3593915	Can I ask this question about Borderlands to Borderlands fans out there?
3594355	3595937	And it is somewhat relevant for this.
3596377	3600501	Are they like are they like Final Fantasy games where I don't need to play them in sequence?
3600521	3604125	Like it's fine to play them out of sequence because everybody tells me I should play Borderlands 2.
3604545	3608169	And my problem is I've tried Borderlands 1 and it's fine.
3608349	3609690	I don't have a problem with the game.
3609810	3614275	I actually, you know, as much as I don't play a lot of shooters, I think the RPG elements make it very interesting.
3614295	3618439	I actually think it's a very interesting sort of setup, but I just haven't really been motivated to really get through the game.
3618419	3620541	so can I just pick up Borderlands 2 and play?
3621302	3645810	there's not a lot crossover yeah you can some of it is like there are some characters that come back like I know between 1 and 2 there was some characters that appeared from 1 that would be introduced again it's not necessary that you know what their backstory is and honestly like a lot of the stuff through the game doesn't really explain much of their backstory other than yeah these are characters from the first game
3645790	3649800	Three, I don't even remember if three had a lot from the other games in it.
3649820	3653148	And then the pre-sequel, I don't know either.
3653329	3657018	Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was also the one that interested me the most, to be quite honest.
3657098	3659243	I like the magical setup of that.
3659560	3661443	Yeah, that was a little bit different as well.
3661784	3665350	I don't think there's a lot that ties in with each other.
3665370	3672103	There are some things like Easter eggs, or maybe you'll catch some more references or something, but I don't think it really takes away from it.
3672123	3674727	And see, I wouldn't say that about every game series.
3674868	3677873	Mass Effect, which I love, I say you really...
3677853	3683886	You at a minimum, you need to do the comic from the first one or watch a playthrough or something of the first game.
3684347	3688957	I realize like it's, you know, it's kind of at its core.
3688977	3692084	It has some different sort of things like the Mako and stuff doesn't really come back in later games.
3692465	3696975	But like, I feel like you need the understanding of the first game in order to really get the second and the third game.
3696955	3700179	and Mass Effect 2 is really, truly one of the greatest games of all time.
3700199	3701981	And I think 3 is up there with it too.
3702802	3704765	But you have to suffer through that first game.
3705245	3713055	But if you don't want to put in the 30, 40 hours in the game because you just want to get to the good stuff, at least do the damn comic to give you the big points.
3713135	3718903	I don't know if you'd agree with that, Jamie, but I feel like that first Mass Effect game is important.
3719023	3719604	It's different.
3719624	3720685	Or just...
3720665	3728153	or at least watch a playthrough of it and then go through and use one of the mod tools to skip the first game.
3729894	3732097	I mean, the first game has a lot of stuff.
3732157	3733358	It has the shifty cow.
3733698	3734379	It has Garrus.
3736021	3736822	Oh, and Kirahi.
3738303	3739304	Hold the line.
3739324	3746051	QuestBuster in chat says you can hop right into 4 without knowing anything about Borderlands other than you can shoot things and get loot.
3746471	3748073	I think we all understand that.
3748053	3773740	All right.
3774749	3791256	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3791236	3795881	So this new version of Acclaim really has nothing to do with the old Acclaim besides the name.
3795901	3798664	But people were wondering, what is it going to be?
3798824	3804070	Is it going to be like a front end for shovelware, like AI garbage and NFT shit?
3804090	3807633	And the answer based on this first direct is pleasantly no.
3807694	3814621	It looks like it's going to put together some interesting sort of indie types of titles and put them together under this Play Acclaim banner.
3815262	3817564	The one that caught my eye, of course, is Gridbeat.
3817544	3821171	Gridbeat was a game that they announced because that was a sort of rhythm.
3821331	3831589	Like I kind of got Crypt of the Necrodancer vibes, but like with like, I don't want to say Tron, but like that more like Neo, like, you know, computer-y sort of vibe going on to it.
3831810	3833713	Ingress vibes.
3833693	3837661	I like to pixel watch here.
3838442	3849424	Yeah.
3849404	3851868	It looked like PowerWash Sim, but not.
3852348	3855333	Yeah, that's a clever idea for a game.
3855993	3857896	Ground Zero Hero was another game.
3857976	3863084	It's an action rogue light where you, of course, are playing in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
3863104	3867470	So, you know, Borderlands story-esque vibes, but I think it's obviously a very different kind of game.
3868451	3869573	Talaka
3869553	3873959	which is, again, another sort of rogue-esque kind of game.
3874480	3877163	Afro-Brazilian mythology in this game.
3877183	3878785	It's a hand-painted game.
3878805	3880608	It's a very artsy kind of game.
3880648	3887777	You play as a young warrior restoring balance as ancient Orisha legends unravel into chaos.
3888098	3888979	So...
3888959	3905955	Toss Down A Package Delivery Adventure Game The Prisoning Fletcher's Quest
3907420	3920704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3920971	3922513	I don't know if I need this in a game.
3922533	3923734	I love my games.
3923814	3925035	Plenty of it in real life.
3925676	3927838	I feel fairly drenched in anxiety myself.
3928899	3932803	Catanaut, which came out as of the day of this.
3932823	3936667	So it's only out on PC for now, but it is another roguelite.
3936687	3938869	So you can see where a lot of these indie games are going, but that's all right.
3939150	3940311	It's a popular genre.
3941052	3944035	And then we have Hyper Yuki Snowboard Syndicate.
3944335	3949240	So honestly, not a bad lineup of games for something that could have been...
3949760	3955808	Like, they could have put the name on junk garbage, and it's nice to see that does not appear to be the case.
3955828	3965121	It does look like they are curating some good indie titles to sort of, you know, put a little production push behind and take a cut of the profits, ultimately.
3965141	3965582	So, yeah.
3966103	3967965	A few comments in chat about the snowboard game.
3968105	3969728	SJ100Matt says, like, the snowboard game.
3969988	3972672	Dr. Suya says, very JSR-like visuals, at least.
3972692	3973012	So, yeah.
3973433	3974434	I...
3974414	3975596	It's hard to be mad at.
3975656	3978701	I think this turned out pretty good, all things expected.
3979142	3984049	And again, if you were expecting something like the return of Double Dragon or something, they already have that somewhere else.
3984069	3988677	Somebody else bought the rights to that, and you were setting your expectations unreasonably.
3988697	3992423	So the indie games that they're bolstering up look to be kind of neat.
3994566	3998953	DarkSakura, I saw this and thought, oh, I know somebody that's going to be happy to hear this.
4000132	4007281	Yeah, so everyone knows my favorite band is Gorillaz, them and Pain.
4007822	4010546	And Pain is actually now called Salvo, but that's a different story.
4013149	4019097	So back in the day, their website was a flash website where you could tour Kong Studios.
4019978	4029210	And, you know, it was I was telling Loki earlier that it kind of gave me a Terry Gilliam vibe, like, you know, the kind of collage-y looking place.
4029190	4051215	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4051195	4055985	you can go through the lobby and they're going to do more rooms and content so that's cool.
4056005	4057728	I'm glad that they've brought it back.
4057748	4068630	There are a lot of other minigames that were hidden in the old version like finding like DAT and putting them in the player the right way or
4069741	4074127	Like clicking different things to find secret rooms and all kinds of stuff.
4074408	4079876	So as a Gorillaz fan, I am all over for this.
4080176	4089690	And it's good that we're getting stuff like this again, because I mean, it seems like a lot of bands are sort of forgetting the fun factor and are looking at the buy our shit factor.
4091071	4092234	Yeah, I agree with that.
4092995	4098207	We don't see a lot of bands with such innovative, interesting websites anymore.
4098227	4103740	It's all just Spotify links on social media, which I understand why it is that way, because that's where the money is.
4104261	4110615	But I think that there's something to be said about building your brand with something really fun like that.
4112080	4140163	yeah and it's just it's so interactive and it also like right when you sign in you have like a um a gravestone and you put your name on it's like well yeah that's uh that's quite right quite right all right uh i'm digging it sjo and her matt says they're putting out a new album soon right oh is this maybe leading to a new album yeah the mountain hmm
4142303	4143885	Cool.
4143905	4144005	Yeah.
4144025	4144666	All right.
4147490	4147750	Go ahead.
4151275	4151615	Okay.
4151976	4153458	I need to, like, not look at the site right now.
4154319	4155220	It's easy to get distracted.
4155280	4155580	All right.
4156041	4157503	Let's go on to Loki.
4159165	4163711	So Genki has reached a settlement with Nintendo.
4163731	4167776	You may remember them from... What was it?
4167796	4168277	Uh...
4168460	4170705	Backroom's a consumer electronics show, right?
4170725	4185540	Yeah, CES, that's right, CES who they had like a 3D printed mock-up of the Switch 2 which, you know, apparently they said was based off of the actual hardware and that got leaked out and...
4185520	4188245	Nintendo was not happy about that.
4188265	4196600	And so with this, they have reached a confidential settlement where they've agreed to make a payment in the agreed upon amount.
4196961	4199025	Of course, they're not going to talk about what it is.
4199546	4205757	Also, they are permanently enjoined from using terms glitched to glitched
4205737	4226496	Genki Direct and Genki Indirect Genki Direct, interesting or any other similar rebranding or approximations of Nintendo's intellectual property products, product names, characters presentations or marks for any accessories compatible or for the marketed use of Nintendo products
4226932	4228575	Um, yeah.
4229196	4237151	And of course, obviously this was because they made that whole 3D printed thing and asserted that it was based off of the actual, uh, hardware.
4237171	4239615	So they can't even, they can't even use the names.
4239635	4243422	So they're going to have to sell like Nontendo swatch accessories.
4243402	4245104	No, they can't even do that.
4245324	4247246	They can't even use something that's similar.
4247426	4256154	So they are not allowed to use approximations of their intellectual property.
4256194	4263782	So it might be that they have to be officially licensed by Nintendo, in case they can use Nintendo.
4263862	4266044	This is for the Nintendo Switch or something like that.
4266064	4269207	But right now, they're not even allowed to...
4269187	4273394	Or they can go bankrupt because of this, which is also a likely outcome.
4273954	4280845	Yeah, we're going to do the direct Genki, or I don't know what the hell they would do.
4281106	4281967	Come up with something.
4282928	4283970	I mean, come on.
4283990	4286714	You can't come up with your own presentation thing.
4286754	4290300	Also, who gives a crap about a direct about game accessories?
4290584	4298574	I know, I can't think of the last time I was seated promptly for a showcase on gaming accessories.
4298594	4299175	Let's go.
4299675	4310388	SSJ100Matt does say, they have the opportunity to do the funniest thing and make a 3D printed doc for NotTheVirtualBoy.
4310468	4312010	Ooh, you want to see a fight, Matt.
4312030	4313572	You're living dangerously.
4314033	4314954	You're living dangerously.
4315995	4317577	That would be funny.
4317757	4320000	They could call it The AR Girl.
4320200	4320901	Yeah, right.
4322864	4326429	Let's move on to a story that's very interesting.
4326449	4343372	So apparently there's this whole issue that happened over in Britain where Sega had involved the British police to recover dev kits and consoles that it negligently disposed of from another business owner who has legitimate claim to those items.
4343352	4348341	Some more info is coming out as to what all is going on here.
4348521	4361445	The Video Game Preservation Museum on social media was attempting to raise money to purchase some of the GBA, DS, DSi, and 3DS games that are as yet undumped.
4361425	4379063	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4379043	4386138	Let me back up a little bit because I poorly explained what actually was happening at its core there with Sega and the British police and all this stuff.
4386579	4393153	So basically what happened is that a seller got this collection
4393420	4405008	I've been running an online resale business for many years specializing in used electronics, whether fully working or sold for spares and repairs.
4405028	4411564	My stock typically comes from office clearances, house clearances, recycling centers, and scrapyards.
4411544	4414990	So nothing nefarious happened here.
4415050	4429914	He went to a scrapyard and a worker there at the scrapyard had a van load of items that reportedly came from Sega's office because of a relocation that happened in the UK from Brentford to Chiswick, where they actually relocated.
4430295	4431397	And there were other things, too.
4431577	4434121	Sofas, office furniture, refrigerators.
4434142	4437467	I think it's Chiswick.
4437633	4467522	but there were electronics as well so of course you know you see that sort of thing he bought it and it was a legal process so that wasn't stolen it's Sega threw things in the trash they probably shouldn't have but then apparently Sega realized that they should not have thrown some of this out because I believe some of it were like dev kits like Wii U test things and stuff that didn't actually belong to them because technically dev kits don't belong to you they belong so that's
4467502	4470565	How this whole thing started.
4470826	4476192	Because Sega basically called the cops, even though this guy didn't really do anything wrong.
4476392	4478975	So it's all a mess.
4479675	4484461	And now this is why the Video Game Preservation Museum is getting in there going, this is bad.
4484901	4487564	Because now this is a game preservation disaster.
4487644	4491028	Because if we can't get access to those games, they're going to be lost.
4491008	4493512	So, interesting.
4493532	4496476	They've gone so far as to launch a Twitter poll.
4496696	4502265	Even though those don't mean shit, it's performative and shows what they may be thinking.
4502285	4509856	Which says, should we launch a GoFundMe to help the Sega seller cover legal costs so Sega can't destroy this history?
4509876	4514223	And of course, 89% are saying yes, and the other 12% are bots.
4515785	4515885	Okay.
4516945	4520653	and, you know, moving on.
4520994	4521415	Let's see.
4521976	4523319	Some new information.
4523619	4528550	They said they brought up PACE, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act from 1984.
4528911	4534262	Only a constable may apply for and execute a search warrant.
4534242	4536365	The... And now I'm trying to look through the whole thing here.
4536505	4540931	The power is statutory and cannot be delegated to private persons.
4541251	4544336	The second image shows the under investigation from unsigned.
4544616	4545617	Feel free to use these images.
4545938	4549042	So like they are... And it looks like they launched the GoFundMe.
4549062	4557113	So they are all in and trying to protect this guy of like basically, hey, what you threw away is ours now, legally.
4557133	4558114	We did nothing wrong.
4558935	4559456	That's it.
4559937	4560958	So...
4560938	4565669	Very, very interesting in this particular situation.
4565689	4566972	I'm with Rinmari, though.
4566992	4568355	I want the Sega sofa.
4571824	4573187	Like, don't you want the sofa?
4574490	4575893	Or some of the furniture?
4576463	4577985	Look at some of these pictures.
4578005	4579466	They're very interesting things.
4580047	4589576	Well, it's like when I go over to my pal Melody's house and her husband is a well-known DDR player from back in the day, Mel B, who once won a Parapara.
4589596	4591138	No, actually, he didn't win this machine.
4591158	4595282	But basically, the Parapara machine in their house is Arcade Infinity's machine.
4595302	4600187	And so I will often get, oh, this used to be Arcade Infinity's Parapara machine here in the house.
4600267	4603490	So it's kind of fun that it has that sort of history behind it, right?
4603991	4605272	So anyway.
4605252	4606674	All right, Arcade Infinity.
4607075	4607756	Yeah, for real.
4608617	4610840	It will be interesting to see how this case develops.
4610900	4632171	It's long from over, but it's interesting how involved and how much they're trying to take the case to the internet, which it's working because here we are signal boosting and we're one of probably a thousand podcasts covering this story this week that are bringing light to this and that Sega should essentially have to let go of what they've let go of.
4633062	4635765	Someone donated a thousand pounds already.
4635785	4637426	Oh, I'm not surprised.
4637446	4640730	Do you suppose that those couches had blast cushioning?
4641450	4642772	Or was that also made up?
4648838	4649238	Alright.
4650099	4652121	We need to change the tone here.
4652141	4657226	We're going to go to our next segment here where we cover a classic game every week.
4657246	4658007	Let's roll the bumper.
4668331	4675777	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4676219	4679370	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4680498	4684484	Alright, but once a month, DarkSakura says, you know what?
4684604	4694278	We're going to take a game that actually made its way to the arcade, and that's what we're going to cover in our classic Game to Arcade monthly segment.
4694619	4703292	And I will warn the audience, it was impossible to find actual footage of this arcade machine, but this is an instantly recognizable game.
4703312	4704694	With that, I'll turn it over to DarkSakura.
4705936	4710302	So for the record, I saw that someone made a futon cover that looks like a Sega Master System.
4710586	4714214	Anyway, the game is Flappy Bird.
4716018	4717180	Yeah, it's Flappy Bird.
4718804	4720588	The arcade version is nothing special.
4720608	4722913	It's the same as the home version.
4726400	4727102	That's not true.
4727122	4729607	I can get tickets from the arcade version.
4729942	4731504	You can get tickets from this one, yeah.
4731904	4735669	So anyway, I'm not going to go into Flappy Bird.
4735809	4741956	Everyone knows what the hell Flappy Bird is, but there were several arcade iterations.
4741976	4751288	So anyway, we have the first one that came out in 2014, and it was like a pub version, sort of.
4752169	4758396	It has a single button in the middle of the machine, and you just hit the button to flap.
4760063	4767479	After that, there was one in 2015, which was Flappy Bird Prize Merchandiser.
4768000	4777600	And it's like a stacker prize game, and you flip the bird through the pipes until a certain number was reached, and then you can get a prize.
4778677	4784843	And then there was the actual Flappy Bird arcade itself in 2015 that's kind of like the Doodle Jump machine.
4785904	4789308	It has Flappy Bird and one big button in the middle.
4789328	4791190	And it's just like the pub version.
4791230	4792911	You hit the button and you flap.
4794533	4800819	There was a clone before 2014 that was called Flying Tickets that had multiplayer.
4802000	4804563	But it essentially functioned the same way.
4805063	4806625	Now, Rob...
4806925	4830233	I did find some video oh fabulous it's a minute it's from M&P Amusement Company which I would reckon is the distributor I will send this to you through Discord just a moment because I didn't notice that it was there or I would have done that before there you go
4831158	4834343	I'm also just running a quick search because I'll probably find it on YouTube.
4834623	4835485	Oh yeah, I see it, I see it.
4836045	4839391	I found this through the site that I got the information on.
4841574	4841834	Okay.
4843096	4847944	And then I also found one of the merchandiser.
4847964	4848725	So I'll link you that too.
4849486	4850247	Okay, anyway.
4850328	4851169	All right, there you go.
4851650	4855114	But really, it's Flappy Bird.
4855214	4856616	I don't know what else to say about it.
4856656	4859219	I don't even know that I've done Flappy Bird as a classic game.
4861782	4867109	But it was worth mentioning because, you know, people will make ticket spitters out of anything.
4869151	4877702	And I've noticed this, that a lot of phone games have become arcade games per se, you know.
4878222	4881767	But at any rate, I thought it was interesting enough.
4883610	4884291	So there we go.
4885032	4893304	And for the record, was there not... That arcade gameplay where they only made it four pipes?
4893324	4898091	Yeah, that's about my experience with Flappy Bird.
4898111	4898211	Yeah.
4898231	4902998	And also, was there not an unofficial reboot last year?
4904024	4912397	I believe somebody else bought... The creator failed to reclaim the trademark.
4912417	4913379	Yes, that's it.
4913399	4915602	Somebody else acquired the trademark, basically.
4916123	4917285	Game Tech Holdings.
4917826	4918547	So yeah.
4918567	4922653	It was released at the end of October 2014 and a mobile version in 2015.
4922693	4928142	And Nian said he had no connection with this game, nor did he sell the rights.
4928122	4942553	and I believe Rinmari I remember that being the case too and chat says they made it into NFT cringe I remember that headline along with the quote-unquote reboot on this game yeah yuck but at any rate yes Flappy Bird had an arcade release
4942955	4946381	But I hope Don Nguyen is having a good day.
4946701	4948764	I hope his coffee is warm and his pillows are cold.
4948965	4950848	I hope he's doing well.
4951128	4959241	It's a bummer that the hysteria over what happened with this game honestly caused the guy to sort of tap out.
4959842	4961645	Honestly, who'd blame him?
4962046	4963228	Yeah, I don't blame him either.
4963488	4967595	So that's why I say I hope he's having a good day, whatever he's doing now, whatever industry he found.
4968385	4970047	All right, let's move on.
4970067	4974834	We still have some headlines for you, including a few rapid ones here in some rapid fire news.
4974954	4975655	Loki, we'll go to you.
4977478	4978078	All right.
4978659	4984587	Well, we have news on a movie that I keep forgetting is still in development, but the Bioshock movie.
4985308	4997245	It was confirmed through a report by the direct from producer Lee that apparently the game is going to be definitely based on the first Bioshock game.
4997613	4999397	So that's good.
4999417	5001362	That one's pretty iconic.
5003767	5004008	Neat.
5004188	5004970	It's still coming.
5005171	5009421	And that producer, I guess he worked on the Minecraft movie, Weapons, and The Long Walk.
5009581	5011285	All supposed to be pretty good movies.
5011754	5014118	There's some big movies in there.
5014179	5015661	Weapons was a pretty huge movie this year.
5016322	5017164	Weapons was a big movie.
5017324	5021372	Long Walk is getting some huge critical buzz on that.
5021392	5025039	Which, of course, God, I remember that Stephen King book from when I was a teenager.
5025079	5031130	Yeah, that book was... Yeah, well, it's got...
5031110	5033657	Yeah, for sure.
5034139	5044107	Yeah.
5045015	5071306	So apparently there was a special game between the Seattle Mariners and the Los Angeles Angels that they did a Super Mario Day during that event and gave out 15,000 custom hats that featured Super Mario cross Mariners.
5071586	5071826	Neat.
5072007	5074009	I bet those are going to be worth some money on eBay.
5076824	5079001	Absolutely.
5079122	5082025	Okay, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5083287	5089132	Well, Stern released a trailer for a new Star Wars pinball.
5089192	5090934	It's Star Wars Fall of the Empire.
5091974	5094296	I reckon based around Empire Strikes Back.
5095618	5097699	There will be several different versions.
5097940	5098880	I looked at it.
5098961	5101663	It looks like it could be fun, but it's not one I think I would want to own.
5103605	5106627	It just didn't seem robust enough for me.
5106647	5112332	But you can also escape from Cloud City and you can...
5112312	5116759	You know, lower the shields on the Death Star during multiball.
5116779	5120886	And you have the Sarlacc Pit and all kinds of stuff.
5120906	5126815	There's even like a force mimicking move for ball save, which I'm just seeing is like a Magna save or something.
5127636	5132023	And then you have a Darth Vader inspired mode or a couple of them.
5132444	5135729	So you get to experience the dark side.
5136110	5136210	Yeah.
5136190	5142302	It also has custom callouts from Chris Bartlett as C-3PO.
5143163	5143845	Sounded pretty good.
5144686	5152461	As far as the releases, there is also going to be a limited edition version.
5152441	5159850	That will be limited to 770 games to honor the release of Star Wars in 1977.
5160611	5168421	And it has the expression light system, speaker expression lighting system as well.
5169001	5177672	Full-color mirrored back glass, full-color high-def cabinet decals, and exclusive custom pinball armor.
5177652	5194417	and designer autographed bottom arch, upgraded sound, anti-reflection playfield, shaker motor, a sequentially numbered plaque, a signed certificate of authenticity and a digital insider connected LE owner's badge on registration.
5194438	5200707	Basically, Stern has this whole system where you can scan and have an online leaderboard sort of thing.
5200687	5210503	The cost for the version, the pro version is, I guess these could change, but right now is set for $6,999.
5211385	5217775	Premium edition for $9,699 and limited for $12,999 US dollars.
5217815	5222183	Will be available in US, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile.
5223565	5224967	There you go.
5224987	5225428	All right.
5226100	5227441	Let's see.
5228222	5232006	Okay, now here's the story that Jason was referencing in the intro tonight.
5232527	5237913	Yes, as of this week, the original PlayStation has turning 30 in America.
5238914	5242838	So yeah, it was released originally on September the 9th of 1995.
5244500	5253050	And yeah, I don't know what else there is to say about it, except hearing that fact probably makes a lot of you feel really old.
5253070	5253390	So yeah.
5254298	5255601	Happy birthday, PlayStation.
5256663	5258808	And don't forget to take your medication, everybody.
5259951	5260592	For your back pain.
5262737	5263118	All right.
5263719	5264380	Let's move on.

5678337	5679980	All right, busy week around the world.
5680341	5686974	Yeah, but as we get closer to November, that is not terribly surprising.
5686994	5691904	Well, with that, we have one more story for you, and then we'll get to the listener roundtable.
5692726	5693187	Loki.
5694196	5699621	Yes, apparently Kojima Productions is celebrating their 10th anniversary.
5699641	5707949	And as a part of that celebration, they're going to be offering a glimpse of their future projects, including OD and Physant.
5709650	5716457	There's going to be a stream partnership with IGN that's scheduled for September 22nd at 11 p.m.
5716617	5717277	Central Time.
5718518	5723443	And no word at what we're going to see, but I guarantee we won't understand it.
5723778	5725782	because that's just Kojima for you.
5725802	5726243	Of course.
5726684	5728848	It'll be abstract.
5728868	5730291	Be like, wow, that looks good.
5730572	5731874	I have no idea what's going on.
5733598	5734940	All right.
5734960	5737766	Is it going to be weirder than babies in someone's throat?
5738628	5738968	It might.
5739349	5740251	It might.
5740417	5769478	DarkTetsuya
5769458	5790572	BUBZI 4D
5790552	5795801	I'm still on the fence on that game, but I have to give them points for the disability representation.
5796362	5809345	And then it quote treats another account saying, originally written to have bad hearing, we reinterpreted her, Oblivia is the name of the character, originally written to have bad hearing.
5809366	5813573	Oh, I can see where that pun might be a little problematic in a 2025 lens, especially.
5813553	5817018	We reinterpreted her with a cute hearing aid.
5817038	5822126	She muses herself by constantly saying Bubsy's name wrong on purpose.
5823368	5824891	I did not mean to play the music.
5824971	5827275	Sorry that went through, folks, especially if that was a little loud.
5828016	5832262	But that's what the character looks like on that little preview there from Blue Sky.
5832523	5835848	So for those of you that are watching live, you can see a little bit of the video there.
5836048	5836489	So yeah.
5836469	5851997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5853142	5873935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5873915	5895197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5895177	5900166	All right.
5901308	5915515	We'll take it.
5915663	5919532	Yeah, S200Matt says, we all saw that Genie movie with Sinbad, right?
5920575	5922600	The more and more this year goes on, the more and more.
5923181	5933065	One other plug I want to give here before we get to any other questions and last minute stories, I want to give a shout out to our friends over at the GameBooey.org video game podcast here on the Voice of Geese Network.
5933045	5951813	GameBooey.org
5951793	5967203	GameBooey
5967183	5967844	Jesus.
5969046	5971049	But we kind of revisited the topic.
5971289	5973893	And those two are always fun to talk to.
5973933	5976517	They're very well researched and very articulate.
5976918	5984169	I would encourage you to listen to their main show, as well as, of course, the B-side show I'm going to be on, which I believe they said will post Tuesday.
5984530	5987875	So check that out this week over at GameBooey.org.
5987855	6007298	Don't have anything.
6007767	6028555	Thank you so much for listening to our show.
6028875	6032560	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
6032540	6049890	Thanks for watching!
6050377	6051359	That's it.
6051379	6052741	I can't think of anything else to say.
6052761	6054664	So let's go to final thoughts.
6055085	6058351	DarkSakura, I believe you said because of your voice you are not streaming tonight.
6058571	6059352	So that's all right.
6059372	6060895	We'll go send the love somewhere.
6061296	6062959	But do you have a final thought for us tonight?
6065904	6068588	I need a nap.
6068608	6071413	Isn't that always and forever?
6071433	6075540	Also, fact check before you post.
6076010	6078384	Lord, Lord help me.
6078404	6079370	The internet this week.
6079873	6081804	Actually, I'll get to that in my final thought.
6082206	6083353	Loki, your final thought.
6084025	6091052	Go watch some of my videos on my channel because I've lost 12 subscribers in the last 28 days.
6092033	6106548	And YouTube keeps doing things to try to suppress content from people, including... I don't know if you guys have heard about the recent changes or something that they did where now there's a big drop in PC platform viewership for some reason.
6106588	6109611	I'm guessing it's probably directly linked to...
6109591	6123853	adblocking or something like that people watching content with adblockers on and so they're not counted as a viewer or something I don't know what it is but it's hard enough to like try to you know do anything so yeah alright
6124846	6134042	Well, my final thought is before you post on social media, ask yourself, do I have to?
6135064	6138249	Because you're going to find there's a lot of hot takes.
6138550	6140574	You could just keep them hot.
6141094	6144080	If you put them out on the counter, they get cold.
6144100	6146584	You can keep them hot by keeping them inside.
6146564	6151109	Sometimes it's just fun to type out your social media posts and then just delete it.
6151149	6151750	That's right.
6152371	6152751	That's right.
6153051	6154713	Type out your post and then delete it.
6155174	6155834	It's a lot of fun.
6156435	6158978	It's a lot of fun and therapeutic.
6159138	6159819	All right.
6159839	6164684	But one thing we're not deleting, your comments, your emails, and all that fun stuff.
6164704	6166747	So please continue to interact with us.
6166787	6167367	We appreciate it.
6167668	6168649	Have a great week, everybody.
6168709	6169730	Thank you so much for watching.
6169750	6171952	We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.
