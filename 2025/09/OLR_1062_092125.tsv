9565	12348	Once upon a time, Sonic was exclusively Sega's darling.
12368	16512	Sega's exit from the console wars means that more gamers get to enjoy Sonic in their games.
16532	19034	That's mostly a good thing.
19875	21236	And turnabout is fair play.
21256	23639	You'll soon be able to race Sonic and others as Mega Man.
24119	24600	Probably.
24900	25320	Hopefully.
26141	27062	Prepare your rush jets.
27423	32167	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
32608	35050	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39080	41502	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41563	45126	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45226	47749	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
47769	50371	We're back and live once again tonight.
50712	55657	Episode number 1062 for September the 21st, 2025.
55937	58460	Do you remember the 21st night of September?
58820	60502	Well, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
60842	62864	It's myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host.
62884	65827	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
67328	67889	Hey.
67909	68209	Hello.
68249	68850	How are you doing?
70147	90855	I'm okay yeah um you've been doing some streaming this week some fun games playing um I've been playing some different stuff and going back to things but I'll talk about that during my gaming week all right sounds good uh we'll go over and say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki hello hi Loki how are you
90970	108905	What is this game you've got playing behind you tonight as we are, of course, taping live as we do every week at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, VOG Network, usually right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except our pal Bobby has the night off.
108925	112328	He is listening to polka music as he posted about on Blue Sky.
112348	116672	Of course, that's code for Weird Al Yankovic, which, you know, I can understand.
116772	119394	Weird Al's a worthy reason to take a night off.
119495	120015	So,
119995	121580	And it was an amazing show.
122001	123445	Yeah, it's a tour, right?
123465	128320	Although I feel like he's, I wonder if he's seeing the exact same thing because I feel like it's part of a festival out there.
128721	130687	I could be wrong, but I feel like that was a thing.
130707	133034	Like there's other bands too, but Weird Al's like the highlight.
133436	133937	I don't know.
134137	162760	as far as I know it was always just Al and Puddles the Clown or Puddles Pity Party that would have been a fun show I don't know why I always miss that stuff I liked that a lot more than I thought I would because I normally hate clowns oh yeah, I didn't think about the sort of conflict there not an amazing voice at least Puddles Pity Party makes clowns bearable
164174	169444	I think I like sad, angry clowns better.
170006	171829	I'm not even going to ask.
171869	173152	I don't want to mess around with it.
173192	173452	All right.
174194	180406	Let's say, oh, I was saying with Loki, you have the game playing behind you, and I don't think I recognize it, but is that C-3PO?
180426	181528	Is that a Star Wars game?
181588	182069	What is that?
182691	183873	It is not a Star Wars game.
184454	185997	No, this is Borderlands 4.
186027	187309	Oh, how do I?
187510	189673	Okay, I was gonna say, how do I not recognize that?
189693	193921	But then again, I'm like, well, I haven't really played the other Borderlands games.
194342	195684	I actually know that's a lie.
195704	198309	I did play quite a bit of Borderlands one, at least.
198329	201274	But like one and two were all like Wild West.
201554	203878	And this looks sci fi Bioshock.
204059	206483	Is there like a tone change that happened in the game?
207188	207809	No.
207829	208449	Oh, okay.
208569	211913	I guess I'm just... There's always sci-fi in Borderlands, wasn't it?
211933	217979	Yeah, but like, not looking like you're in a space station or whatever this is that's playing on the game right now.
218059	219220	Well, it's just a villain, you know?
219240	220481	Don't villain things.
220501	222163	Alright, alright.
222303	227769	Let's get into some gaming news, which I actually, again, I feel like we've really been in this news drought lately.
227909	234836	I don't know what the heck is going on, what's in the air, but we do have some things to talk about, of course, you know, but it's just kind of odd.
235116	237178	Are they terrific things?
237158	241406	No, well, there's a couple stories tonight that are fine.
242007	244030	That's what we're here for.
244251	244952	Yeah, I know.
245473	247216	We let everyone know what's going on.
247276	252906	We give you the pulse on the gaming world so you don't have to go look all this stuff by yourself and be depressed about it.
252953	254876	The good, the bad, and the ugly.
254896	259242	And I think DarkSakura, you have a kickoff topic for us tonight that is kind of bad and ugly.
259262	261004	This ain't just ugly, it's fugly.
263607	271418	So yeah, just when you thought it was safe to spend money again, Microsoft is raising Xbox prices in the US.
271398	277063	So Series S 512 is going from $380 to $400.
277183	280447	I mean, it's a $20 increase for some of them.
280527	282308	The Series X Digital is going up $50.
283389	285371	The Series X is going up $150.
285391	286072	Wow.
286112	294059	But the Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition is going from $730 to $800.
294099	297142	And this is the second price increase this year.
297663	298003	Yeah, wow.
298123	300105	And the last time they raised prices was in May.
301132	302934	Yeah, I agree, Brad.
302954	303434	JFC.
304215	306057	Or FFS in my case.
308399	312484	But yeah, I mean, it's not just Microsoft doing it.
312544	315647	This is just like a more recent trend.
315867	318830	I mean, think about our current economic environment.
320332	330362	But Sony has raised their prices earlier this year, and we know that the Switch 2 pre-orders were delayed because Nintendo was looking into their options.
331355	360568	and it was higher than people expected but now the Switch has a price you know price race too I think that happened what beginning of August end of July and all the accessories too got a hike too I'm glad I got mine free free and it still works but yeah yeah so if you want even the cheapo Xbox
360785	362070	400 bones.
363535	368400	Well, the cheaper way to play Xbox right now is to not fucking bother and do the cloud.
368420	371563	Like, honestly, seems like, I mean, well, you know, it depends on your internet, right?
371583	375026	Because if you're getting charged a lot for bandwidth and that's not going to be a cheap option.
375447	391863	But it sure looks more and more like the cloud is such an attractive option because no matter what your PC is powered at, as long as you meet that bare minimum to do cloud gaming, which isn't much, you know, you can access Xbox and stuff on Game Pass, which is probably why Microsoft's leaning more and more into the cloud.
392143	392243	Yeah.
393151	395318	I got my gigabit ethernet.
395338	395619	Yeah.
395819	401015	I got my Mac Studio that comes with a gigabit jack.
401738	401878	Mm-hmm.
402415	404478	So, I'm good.
404618	407924	I don't need no Xbox to make my life happy.
408064	410207	I feel like Microsoft's adding more to the cloud gaming too.
410227	415335	I feel like I just saw a story about things that aren't necessarily in your library you can still stream.
416437	426493	You'd have to purchase it one way or the other, I'm sure, but they're trying to open up more and more of the cloud streaming, which makes sense because the obvious question in the room is who's going to buy a fucking Xbox right now?
426513	427915	Who is going to buy an Xbox right now?
428576	430279	I feel like
430259	433323	People to whom money is no object.
433984	436768	I don't want to say you're a fool if you buy an Xbox right now.
436788	438871	You are free to spend money how you see fit.
438891	441414	And if that is the value to you, then go off, sis.
441554	446761	But I really feel like the Xbox is set up to fail right now.
446821	447863	And I completely understand.
448383	450746	This is because of the political environment and things going on there.
450766	454191	This is not like Microsoft's sole decision or something.
454211	455693	The industry is set up to fail.
455673	459235	Yeah, that's another way to look at it for sure.
460181	462274	Or they're trying to solve...
462710	471323	What they see as a problem with the only way that a corporation knows how, they don't think outside of the box.
472004	475689	The last person to truly think outside of the box was Iwata.
476571	479716	I mean, as far as the head of the company.
479856	486726	I was reading the other day an interview with the head of Larian who was also just like,
486706	489375	No, they're doing it all wrong.
489897	490820	This is what you do.
490861	498487	You have to make sure that your user base is happy and you keep it into something that they want to spend that money on.
498748	499230	Yeah.
500273	508628	Looking at chat, I feel like this just puts a lot in perspective what PodCulture says here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
508648	517022	PodCulture says, I paid less and I bought mine from a damn scalper in the pandemic, which that's a whole other can of worms.
517343	523193	But whether you agree with PodCulture doing that or not, it sure puts a lot into perspective.
523173	549028	Yeah, I know, I know.
549228	550590	It's just, it's wild.
550610	565810	So yeah, I just, I just, like, for me, if I'm Phil Spencer and I'm Xbox, which thank God I'm not, but if I'm there, like, I am just at this point starting to really step away from trying to sell hardware and really pushing how software can carry.
566091	568154	How do, how is the cloud lucrative?
568194	570076	How is Xbox Game Pass lucrative?
570397	574582	How do indie games still run great on Xbox One?
574602	576124	And that makes a decent solution.
576465	578728	And like, I, I, and it,
578708	593508	To Microsoft's credit, they have been leaning into this for a while, certainly more so than their competitors, with the whole every box is an Xbox and that whole thing that they have been doing for several months ahead of anything that happened in the political climate.
593528	598995	So I do feel like Microsoft is probably better set up for this kind of crap than anybody.
598975	606627	but I mean not that Sony seems to be hurting but I would still argue the same thing and say the exact same thing about PlayStation 5 right now.
606647	610834	I don't think it's a smart time to buy a PlayStation 5 either or a PlayStation 5 Pro.
610854	618767	I realize the price of those hasn't gone up as much but you still know there is a literal artificial price increase to those systems.
623073	624696	It's just so weird.
627916	633503	This is what unchecked power by someone who doesn't know what he's doing happens.
634344	635165	No, 100%.
635185	635345	100%.
635365	637908	SSJ100, Matt.
637928	639510	Oh, go ahead.
639530	646298	You know, not to get too political, but I mean, they already made H1B visas, you know, now a subscription model.
646338	651263	So, you know, it's just the way the world's going, I guess.
651704	657771	Like, literally, I don't smoke, but I feel like sitting on the porch and just taking a big drag off a cigarette and just going...
658038	658779	What's next?
659300	661082	What are the horrors we're going to wake up tomorrow?
661363	662765	Damage report!
662785	669594	It's just... I'm just at this point where nothing... Well, because every day shocks me, nothing shocks me.
671997	674160	Oh, here's the latest bit of drama I heard.
674481	684855	I was listening to... It was like some Fox News interview with a constitutional specialist who was like, yeah, um...
685696	691192	There will be no third or fourth term because it's in the Constitution.
691212	692356	Like, are you sure?
692376	695264	It's like, dude, I'm a constitutional scholar.
695365	695746	Hello.
696347	697812	And people are always like, oh, well, we'll see.
698253	699958	No, no, no, no.
700293	700754	No.
701354	702956	No.
702976	703637	Did I say no?
704438	705439	No.
705459	710565	Let me put it this way, because this is really what I'm seeing happening on a wide scale.
710585	720777	And I've said this a lot about gaming, and yes, this does have to do with video games, because this is the exact same thing I've been saying about video game media and the way we perceive things and the way things go on social media.
721058	723921	The truth doesn't matter.
723901	726745	I know, shocking, but that's the facts.
727125	728868	The truth doesn't matter.
729589	733153	It's the perception that guides things at the end of the day.
733173	733894	And you know what?
734195	737659	You know what some people do politically?
737679	748153	They get on there and they push, they push, they talk, they talk, they lie, they lie, and try to shift people's perceptions because then that becomes the truth.
748336	753222	And this has been happening ever since it was Barack Obama wasn't born in the U.S.
753242	755966	When like literally there is a birth certificate that says Hawaii.
756626	761052	It has literally been that since, what was that, 20 years ago at this point?
762754	763335	No, not that long.
763355	768201	If you didn't want Hawaii to be considered part of the United States, then maybe you shouldn't colonized it.
769835	771840	It's just the whole thing.
772000	772321	Anyway.
773082	776751	So, and you know, if you're pissed that we're getting political on this whole thing, tough titty.
776911	782865	Because this is, this Xbox going up, video games getting expensive.
783368	785451	There is nothing else to blame for that.
785491	788494	You need to challenge your perception.
788514	789836	And that's something we can all do.
789956	792679	Me, you, everybody.
792699	795162	Challenge your perceptions.
795182	798146	And look at what is really driving these price increases.
799968	802111	Fact check all the things.
804294	804634	Anyway.
806369	810434	So the way we escape from the harshness of reality is that we play video games.
810454	816661	So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing to take our minds off of the horrors of the real world.
816681	818323	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
819585	823429	I actually took a break off of Dead by Daylight for the week.
823509	828075	I mean, I did log in a couple of times just to, you know, check stuff.
828095	830478	But I took the week off.
830498	835043	I've had a really awful, gut-wrenching week.
835529	846231	and um I've had a lot going on at work so I just have been trying to focus on things that make me happy and so um I uh
847679	849142	I played Palia.
849943	861504	I played Avatar Frontiers of Pandora because shooting the silly, terrible human beings in that game make me really happy because people suck.
864049	867595	I put it to a vote on my Discord.
867575	868737	for what game I should play.
868757	876193	Because I've played through Dragon Age Inquisition like four times on stream and Mass Effect twice.
876995	878177	Three times, I think.
878538	879640	Meaning the whole trilogy.
880321	881283	Yeah, the whole trilogy.
882125	884470	And so I was like, okay, so what should I play?
884450	886914	and everyone wanted to see Symphony of the Night.
886934	888256	And I was like, okay, which version?
888316	894185	The PlayStation one or this put together edited Saturn one?
894225	895447	And they're like, the Saturn one.
895507	897150	I'm like, okay, play the Saturn one.
898171	904321	So I'm like two thirds through the first castle just running around being an idiot.
905182	906043	I'm sad I missed that.
906063	907105	I wanted to see that version.
907125	910390	Accidentally using Soulsteel the one time I don't want to use it.
911838	930876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
931025	956982	and then there's this one uh like sword knight guy that's like a pain in the ass to get through but if you can jump past him and then go behind you get a room with stuff but then you punch the wall and kneel down in the wall and after like a minute or so you go down a platform and right there is the jewel knuckle and you get like amazing attack at a really early level
957299	961286	I feel like it's been so long since I played Symphony of the Night on any platform.
961867	966035	I'd like to experience it on Saturn, but I haven't really played the game forever.
966055	967858	I can hook you up.
967878	968459	Yeah, that'd be cool.
969401	969861	We'll talk.
969881	970262	We'll talk.
970743	971725	Nice.
971825	975692	But yeah, I'm going to be playing Palia tonight.
975772	977836	Just, you know, again, I want to keep some chill vibes.
977876	980320	I'm going back, though, to my...
980975	988104	Try to get P100 Pig and my Dracula Adept, which is actually kind of hard.
988344	990247	I'll be honest, it's hard.
990267	991769	I'm not looking forward to Hellmaster at all.
992450	996975	But I've also just been playing a lot of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
997596	1004145	I also found a translation for the Super Famicom Record of Lodoss War RPG.
1006067	1010813	I forgot that it was semi-tactics based.
1010793	1015861	But I played it for a little bit and got all nostalgic for the anime.
1015881	1018565	And I'm actually reading the first of the books right now.
1020668	1026938	For anyone who doesn't know, Record of Lodoss War, if I recall correctly, was a tabletop RPG first, based off D&D.
1028039	1031324	And then it spun anime and video games and all kinds of stuff.
1034449	1037053	So I played a little bit of that, and...
1038147	1041852	I was trying to decide if I wanted to do another SNES RPG.
1042433	1050865	So I was just trying a few different ones and seeing if it hit any kind of joy in my heart.
1052087	1053850	So far, not really much of anything.
1053970	1056814	I might start Marvelous, considering that.
1057334	1077233	but I also started playing Minecraft and by started playing I meant I have the game and started downloading mods and I am going to be playing well I played before and then I got bored my account expired so I had to get it again but
1077213	1081297	I'm going to be doing a bonus stream with Shay.
1081717	1086601	Right now, her delightful boyfriend Ryan is visiting from Scotland.
1086641	1087302	Hello, you two.
1088423	1093648	And so I probably won't be able to do that until after TwitchCon.
1095469	1101355	But I also did promise to do a stream of playing Marvel Rivals.
1101375	1107220	And I am opening that up to whoever wants to play with me and keep me from not dying.
1107200	1135654	because I'll get motion sick I need someone to hold my hair when I throw up maybe it depends on when because I literally have played that game once and it wasn't even against real people it was against bots it's the only way I've played that game I'm thinking about I wanted to wait until Nightcrawler was out in the game because I know it has to happen but I have all this stuff for Invisible Woman I was thinking of either going to Emma or Phoenix I haven't decided
1137355	1138481	I can figure out a healer.
1138501	1142138	I don't remember who I was playing that I liked for heals but I can figure it out.
1143003	1144108	Heals please, heals please.
1144493	1145154	Yeah, exactly.
1145174	1145615	Heal, please.
1146295	1149200	As 200 Matt says, Jamie and Loki are playing Minecraft.
1149220	1150461	Time for Rob to join in.
1150521	1151563	Ha ha ha.
1151583	1154287	I mean, I have Minecraft and I've played it before.
1154387	1156510	I just, I don't get sucked in the way Matt does.
1156990	1160675	And then I kind of go, oh, for my crafting joy, I'm going to play No Man's Sky.
1160755	1161456	You know, I don't know.
1162137	1165041	Maybe I sometimes feel a little bit stuck on what to do in Minecraft.
1165061	1166203	That's what I have Palia for.
1166824	1168046	Yeah, I can always give it another go.
1168066	1171030	And for the record, Psylocke is in it, but I think it's Quanon Psylocke.
1171330	1172532	Hmm.
1172552	1172712	Yeah.
1173805	1183460	But as far as... If I want my crafting, I go to Palia because I've gotten a lot better at some of the glitching.
1184602	1195058	And I'm actually saving up to buy yet another property because they have new houses out, but I don't want to destroy my old houses to build the new houses.
1195078	1195258	Oh, okay.
1195278	1197581	The new houses are infinitely customizable.
1197641	1199244	Like, you can remove walls.
1199264	1200606	You can add, like...
1201548	1204517	different trim and vines to the roof and all kinds of stuff.
1204557	1205841	It's pretty intense.
1206062	1206423	I love it.
1207165	1209071	But yeah.
1209091	1210355	Talia is still my happy place.
1210395	1211980	That and the Avatar game.
1212398	1236769	Well, I was just...
1237677	1249114	I was just thinking is that if I find matches that I thought I had fun in, whether or not I won, that I would just, you know, edit out some of the slow parts and put some silly commentary on it and upload it.
1249234	1252459	And it took me like two hours to do it.
1252539	1259430	I was watching another Dead by Daylight pig main and was like, you know, I may as well just do this while I'm watching.
1259450	1259550	Yeah.
1260543	1274620	and I will go ahead and give them a shout out it's Justin Bubba, UK streamer who congratulations on finishing your dissertation get your masters but we pig mains, we gotta stick together
1275292	1280657	And then you mentioned TwitchCon and I kind of had a moment of like, oh crap, that is like right around the corner.
1280697	1282459	That's less than a month away at this point, right?
1283060	1283520	It is.
1283600	1287604	I'm going to have to finish fixing my pig cosplay.
1288445	1292529	And I was considering doing a Legion again.
1292730	1294591	I think it's just going to be pig for a day.
1295132	1296513	Okay.
1296533	1296794	Yeah.
1297655	1298255	Well, that'd be fun.
1299777	1299897	Hey.
1300537	1301158	Yeah.
1301178	1302059	All right.
1302079	1305062	Well, let's go over to Loki and check on your gaming week, Loki.
1305599	1307242	It's just been Minecraft.
1307262	1309025	I've been digging a hole.
1309045	1309606	Very big hole.
1312972	1314976	But you've been streaming Minecraft as well, right?
1315637	1316519	Yeah, digging a hole.
1317380	1317961	Just digging the hole?
1318101	1320065	Big hole?
1320446	1323631	Yeah, it's about 4.5 million blocks.
1324733	1325495	Is it for all your enemies?
1325715	1328019	Wait, I thought that wasn't possible in Minecraft.
1328039	1330223	I thought you hit the bottom eventually.
1331823	1349815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1351212	1352734	Down into the core.
1353674	1355516	Yeah, there is a point where you hit the bottom.
1356437	1366187	Yeah, I mean, you eventually get to the bedrock layer, and then if you know the way to exploit the game to break the bedrock layer, then you just open it up into the void, and if you jump into the void, then you die.
1367809	1368590	Nothing lives in the void.
1368610	1369931	But if you want to conquer the void.
1371152	1373314	You can dangle mobs into the void.
1373334	1379160	There is a little buffer area that you can use entities, but other than that, you can't build down there.
1379541	1380882	Oh, well, I do love that idea.
1383089	1389138	Then again, you can also mod the game to have a higher build limit.
1389599	1397151	You could do a couple thousand, then it just really tanks the computer, though, because it has to calculate all those extra blocks and everything.
1397291	1403360	Yeah, so digging a big hole actually might end up having to be about 50% bigger, too.
1403901	1406184	Unfortunately, because I was looking at it the other day.
1406345	1409489	I don't know how big it needs to be, but this is how big I'm starting.
1410451	1411813	We need to talk about mods.
1413042	1416006	There's lots of stuff with mods.
1416026	1416727	Yeah, I can help you with mods.
1416747	1417168	I saw.
1417809	1421614	Well, good luck on your hole digging, Loki.
1421634	1429145	You know, most people I talk to on Blue Sky are looking to get their hole filled, so it's ironic that you're digging a giant hole in your game.
1429165	1432750	Yeah, I have so much material left from the hole.
1432770	1436996	Like, I've got 200 plus shulker boxes of stone right now.
1438238	1438358	Uh...
1438642	1466438	for comparison a shulker box is basically a chest so it's more than I'll ever need and that was just like the first 10 layers I stopped collecting materials now, I just don't collect anything, I just let it rot maybe copper, that's about it, but everything else I just let it die because I'm like, I cannot store all of this, nor would I ever use all of this and it would actually...
1466823	1469748	It would probably lag out the game.
1470429	1470889	I don't know.
1471911	1474435	You can build pig shrines.
1474836	1478121	SSJ100Matt is interested in the void, saying this void sounds pretty good.
1478141	1479283	Do they allow early voting?
1479483	1481727	Yeah, the void might be a better place to live these days.
1482668	1483870	They do not.
1485706	1487489	They built Dead by Daylight and Roblox.
1487669	1489652	I bet it could be done in Minecraft.
1490573	1490914	Oh, I'm sure.
1490994	1491535	Probably.
1491715	1495821	I think someone did build something like that.
1495982	1496543	It depends.
1496823	1506718	You can do some limited stuff with Redstone, or if you decide to go the route I did with Datapacks, you can do quite a bit more with that.
1507627	1509990	So yeah, you probably could do Dead by Daylight.
1510151	1512474	It would just be tricky.
1512494	1514216	I mean, Tango did.
1514236	1515198	Well, I found it.
1515518	1517081	Dead by Daylight Minecraft maps.
1517101	1526915	I was going to say, I bet some maps, especially like Leary's and stuff, I bet some maps are, I don't want to say easy to recreate Minecraft, but relatively versus other things.
1526935	1529258	The maps are probably somewhat easy to create.
1529278	1530520	It's just the gameplay.
1530600	1533043	Recreating the gameplay would be very difficult.
1533103	1537009	You'd probably be able to have something where you could stand on a
1536989	1541618	Pressure Plate 2, Fix, Generator, or something like that.
1542339	1544503	Someone did Dead by Midnight.
1546126	1551917	I'm sure you could build some things that mimic the gameplay.
1551997	1556365	Someone I knew recently built Clash of Clans.
1557290	1572868	Thank you for watching!
1573456	1575961	I don't know, at that point that's kind of what you have to do.
1576042	1594080	But yeah, just because the game making Sands of Time is essentially, it's a random, normally it's a random generated dungeon, and so because I have to make a dungeon that goes out in all different directions, like even the main room I think is like at least
1595174	1621654	I don't know, at least like 70 blocks by 70 blocks wide and right now the whole I have I think it's like 169 blocks by like 200 and something and then 90 blocks deep is what I was going for but I'm probably going to have to expand it at least another 100 or so blocks out the sides depending on how I end up deciding to lay everything out that's the problem is I don't have any idea how I'm going to lay anything out yet
1622967	1624109	We'll see.
1624710	1625692	It's going to be fun.
1626514	1628839	Folks in chat are talking about mobs.
1628859	1636855	Loony Bard says, heck, there's a mob for Quiet Place, and that sounds kind of scary as well.
1636875	1644570	But it made me think, okay, so speaking of scary mods, you know the thing that I'm seeing all the time now on...
1644550	1649937	TikTok, that is a Roblox thing, like the newest thing in survival horror, okay?
1649997	1651679	I found a video of it I can play here.
1651699	1656005	I know it's a little harder for you guys to see, but I'll show it on our Twitch TV stream.
1656025	1671385	This is called One Night at Rue's, and it's RuPaul's Drag Race, and it's like they have the workroom, and it's like a horror game, and you get chased around by this giant RuPaul that looks scary as fuck.
1671365	1673607	Fuck, that like chases you around the shadows and stuff.
1673627	1681274	I'm trying to see a place where maybe this person's getting chased by like Rue or something that is really scary when that thing is following you.
1681294	1684037	But it looks like Slenderman, but it's like RuPaul.
1684778	1689823	And obviously we'll do that laugh, that ah-ha-ha-ha, you know, that laugh that RuPaul does.
1689843	1690703	So it just looks so scary.
1690723	1693266	There's another one my kids are telling me about called 99 Nights.
1693286	1694527	I'm like, wait, that's like an Ami game.
1694547	1697790	They're like, no, it's like nights as in nighttime.
1698471	1700713	Not 99 Nights as in, you know...
1700693	1702215	One million troops.
1704458	1707323	TigerClaw in chat says, Roblox is scary enough as it is.
1707343	1708064	Yes, yes.
1709025	1714653	SGO100Matt says, Rob, did you see that George A. Romero's daughter is coming out with a zombie movie, Queens of the Dead?
1714974	1715795	I did see that.
1715815	1717137	That looks like it'll be a lot of fun.
1717157	1718559	I want to check that out at some point.
1719240	1723326	OrangeRite says, you don't just lip sync for your life.
1723306	1724327	That's a good tagline.
1724387	1725048	That's a good tagline.
1725828	1728991	Did you hear that they're going to make like a big budget drag race movie?
1729551	1735096	Like they're actually making a movie to be on the big screen that RuPaul confirmed he's starring in this week.
1735116	1735377	Yeah.
1735737	1738259	They're going to make a movie set in the drag race universe.
1738279	1746286	I don't know what the fuck that means because they've made other like media like what AJ and the Queen was practically and that got canceled after one season.
1746606	1748688	There was that bitch who stole Christmas movie.
1749549	1750610	It wasn't very good.
1751531	1752992	So I...
1752972	1755795	I would, yeah, that's going to be very interesting.
1756456	1760080	When are the queens going to do some actual drag racing?
1760140	1764205	Like all this promise of drag race and there's yet no racing going on.
1764225	1769772	The promos for whatever season Sasha Colby won were all like racing themed.
1769812	1772575	I want to say the very, very first season was all racing themed too.
1772915	1778242	But like, you know, now that the budget's bigger, whatever recent one that Sasha Colby won, they actually were posing with cars and shit.
1778602	1780124	So they do lean into the jokes a lot.
1780164	1782827	Just spin it off into like a Fast and the Furious series, you know?
1782807	1784576	That's right.
1785098	1787871	The fast and the fierce.
1787892	1789459	The fast and the fierce?
1791025	1792407	That has potential.
1792828	1793149	I know.
1793189	1793429	I know.
1793489	1793750	All right.
1794531	1794992	Let's see.
1795713	1798077	Oh, SC100 Matt says needs a kart racing game.
1798177	1798958	Perfect.
1799179	1799800	Oh, my God.
1799980	1800681	Perfect.
1800701	1804388	They try to push season two cross worlds, right?
1804808	1807152	They try to push mobile game slop on me.
1807172	1812221	There's some type of like match three RuPaul game that they try to push on me all the time and ads.
1812341	1813062	I'm like, no, thank you.
1813283	1814164	No, thank you.
1814144	1817451	All right, let's talk about my gaming week, which ironically does involve match three.
1817732	1822041	But first, I will mention I'm still playing Final Fantasy 11 on Cat's Eye.
1822202	1828034	I'm already like level 40 on Red Mage, like level 30 on Dancer, just because everything's like so hyper powered.
1828054	1829778	But that's been fun to like play with some of my friends.
1829939	1830600	That's cool.
1830580	1832762	But believe it or not, I've been playing something else too.
1832863	1835045	Yay, I'm playing other games.
1835065	1839190	I actually checked out something new that just came out, but it's an old game that's new again.
1839670	1841292	I checked out the Puzzle Quest.
1841312	1848920	I think it's called Immortal Edition, but it's basically the new version of Puzzle Quest that's 4K and all the DLC included and everything.
1849521	1852404	It was only, I think, $11.99 on PlayStation right now.
1852504	1854146	I think it's on sale the first week.
1854166	1857550	And because PlayStation Stars is going away,
1857530	1860855	I actually had like $15 worth of gifts.
1860935	1868928	So I ended up getting this game for free because I had like $15 worth of credit on PlayStation Store because of everything fading with PlayStation Stars.
1869429	1873075	So I ended up getting the game for free and...
1873055	1877282	Yeah, so Puzzle Quest, I mean, that game was out years ago on what, the PSP?
1877302	1878203	Maybe the DS as well.
1878223	1880427	It was on everything, I think, at one point.
1880647	1889141	It's essentially a match-three game, but it's a little harder than that because you have to think, you know, you're always going up against some type of opponent.
1889161	1897134	So, like, you're going up against a spider or an undead rat or, you know, I'm sure later on you actually get to fight people, but I'm still in the early stages of the game.
1897795	1898877	And you have to...
1898857	1902663	Because you do a match three, then your opponent does a match three.
1903084	1909714	So you have to think about what you're doing to the board and how that's going to affect the board to set up your opponent.
1910135	1915123	Because the way you damage your opponent is that there's not just the regular colors that represent mana.
1915143	1917246	There's red, yellow, green, blue.
1917667	1920912	But then there's purple asterisks for XP.
1921312	1923416	There's gold for gold.
1923436	1924898	And then there are skulls.
1924878	1940946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1940926	1966647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1966627	1988517	Thanks for watching!
1988817	1991522	Fifth Dream says, Puzzle Quest is underrated.
1991622	1992543	I love it.
1992563	1996891	And speaking of, the Marvel version has Captain Betsy Britton in it, so it's better than Rivals.
1997512	1998113	That's right.
1998233	2000056	Marvel had a spinoff Puzzle Quest.
2000096	2002160	Puzzle Quest was everywhere.
2002200	2003582	There was, what, three Puzzle Quest games?
2003602	2004564	They had the Marvel Puzzle Quest.
2004584	2005766	It was everywhere.
2005786	2007408	And then it just went away.
2007428	2010133	I feel like Puzzle Quest has been gone for like...
2010113	2012216	I don't want to say a decade, but at least since COVID.
2012236	2013699	I haven't seen a new Puzzle Quest game in a while.
2014039	2016363	So I don't know what happened behind the scenes to let it come back.
2016403	2021151	I haven't been following it that closely, but it's cool that it's back again.
2021251	2023796	So maybe they'll create more stuff in the future.
2023836	2030086	I seem to remember really liking Puzzle Quest 3 in particular, and I don't remember why, but maybe they'll go through and release the old games.
2030146	2035615	But yeah, if you enjoy Match 3 and strategy games, I think Puzzle Quest is worth it.
2035595	2057147	I think this would be a really good candidate for the Switch though I do sort of wish I had this one on a more portable type of system it's on my I bought it on PlayStation 5 but um which is fine it looks really good for a puzzle game um but if I don't know if it's on Switch 2 but if it is that's probably the way to go with it to be honest um
2058629	2087218	I'm trying to look really fast do research live to see if it's on yeah it does look like it is on Nintendo platforms it's on the regular Nintendo Switch and so I'm sure runs on Switch 2 as well so that might be the way to do it if you want a puzzle game to go on the go so that was my gaming week we're gonna move on we've got some headlines to cover in the gaming industry including one we brought up earlier and last week Loki some continued updates on this front yeah
2087688	2094664	Yeah, so Borderlands 4 has had a lot of issues with basically just optimization issues.
2096027	2103925	Overall, gameplay-wise, it's been pretty positive as far as the reviews go, but there are still some struggles with...
2103905	2129423	Performance even on high-end hardware and one of the things that people are running into and this is actually on console too so outside of the whole PC realm there consoles have a really bad memory leak bug right now and so unfortunately it's not really something that they they're able to fix right away but they are working on it but in the meantime they're like well if
2129774	2137182	If you run into this bug, which means after playing the game for long enough, it'll start dropping FPS.
2137202	2139525	You just have to save, quit, and restart.
2140726	2141708	And away you go again.
2142629	2145492	They had to know about this bug before releasing.
2145512	2146513	They had to.
2146533	2150357	Those playtesters test for hours and hours at a time.
2150377	2151799	This had to have come up.
2153078	2154741	I would assume so.
2154761	2156644	I would assume it did, but, you know.
2156884	2167322	You know, and I want to acknowledge, we all know that testers find bugs that then are discussed in some sort of forum about, is it worth the time to fix this bug or should we release anyway?
2167783	2169405	And I can't help but get this feeling.
2170247	2175416	I can't help but get this feeling that this release date for this game was non-negotiable under any circumstance.
2175576	2178040	And that's what these performance issues are leading me to believe.
2178728	2179229	Pretty much.
2179889	2186596	Along with that, you know, so they're running into, like I said, issues with like DLSS and the PC requirements and stuff like that.
2186696	2195426	Even though folks have really powerful rigs, they're barely cracking like 60 FPS or, you know, they're still getting slowdowns and stuff like that.
2195446	2201732	And of course, I think as we were talking before, Randy Pitchford, not helpful in this situation.
2202553	2206137	Basically just fighting everybody in social media and
2206420	2211269	saying that, no, you're just losers with weak computers and that's why you can't run my perfect game.
2211429	2212431	He needs a babysitter.
2212451	2217520	Why don't you guys code your own Unreal 5 engine, you know, and then we'll be your customers.
2217880	2219483	See how hard it is.
2219503	2226876	Then again, I don't know how far I want to go with this rant, but especially these days.
2227177	2230143	Social Media, and in particularly, X and Twitter.
2230263	2233871	And you know I've been bitching about Twitter ever since you know who bought it.
2234191	2235534	It's been a problem ever since then.
2235554	2237778	But I mean just within the last few months.
2237939	2239582	I wonder what happened.
2240484	2246957	Like, logging onto that site, I can't believe is good for anybody's mental health.
2246937	2267832	anybody's mental health unless you are maybe a somebody who makes their living off adult entertainment and your only focus on that site is the adult side of things maybe but even then the worst of the worst people are on that website and responding to things and stuff and I just I don't see how anybody can get joy
2267812	2288824	Out of a post on that website anymore And this is just Randy Pitchford He just does this Because even before the game was released People were complaining about the price of it And he's like Well, I guess you're just not really true fans then Because you're not paying $80 for our game It's just like He doesn't shut the fuck up About stuff
2289884	2296084	Randy, what happened to all that porn that was on your USB drive that you left at a fucking medieval times?
2296104	2297449	What happened to that shit?
2297469	2301261	Let's bring that up since you're being a little asshole on social media.
2301916	2304401	Just delete the account.
2304561	2310212	This isn't like a delete your account, I hate you.
2310272	2314861	This is delete your account for your mental health and well-being.
2314881	2317266	Delete your account to make you feel better.
2317286	2319310	That's what I'm saying to Randy Pitchford.
2319410	2321494	Delete your account because...
2321474	2332108	you won't be so stressed out all the time he could have just it was so easy for him just to take the W on this for people to completely forget all he had to do
2332477	2352392	because the game was getting great reviews already is go hey we hear some of you're struggling with you know optimization issues in the game we're working on it when we hear you we're working on it done there you go everyone's like cool they're on it the game's great let's let's go you know everybody would have been positive about it it would have been a lot of good
2352372	2354295	Press and PR for the company.
2354316	2359285	But no, Randy Pitchford has to be correct all the time and just made it completely.
2359725	2366858	It is now overshadowing how good the game is because of his dumbass responses on social media.
2367840	2372869	I unfortunately think he's in a position as far as ownership of the company that no one can really tell him to stop.
2373350	2373891	But...
2375423	2377126	People should tell him to stop.
2377246	2386079	It's like you could have this, you know, this could have been painted in a completely different light if you would just shut the hell up.
2387802	2392028	TigerClaw on chat says social media in general isn't good for anyone's mental health, to be honest.
2392229	2393391	I'm not going to argue with that.
2393651	2395494	You are correct on that.
2395514	2396976	This guy's been just fine for me.
2397175	2401503	Blue Sky is fine because I think Blue Sky is extremely curatable.
2401523	2404207	There's no algorithm on Blue Sky unless you opt into one.
2404508	2408354	And I think that is crucial for why Blue Sky has a different feel to it.
2408635	2410999	Because you build your experience on Blue Sky.
2411079	2411760	You truly do.
2411841	2414425	There is no other entity pushing it at you.
2414405	2433392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2433372	2437597	It automatically removes my tweet and you don't even see what that person quoted.
2437617	2438698	You just see whatever they said.
2439058	2448148	But I actually didn't block that person because the other thing you can do on Blue Sky is you can simply go to that little post and you can say detach post.
2448168	2451652	And it automatically – it will replace the post with deleted by author.
2452553	2454054	And I looked at this person's timeline.
2454094	2455476	That's all they do is quote post.
2455656	2456477	And it's like –
2457402	2459304	But that is a security measure.
2459324	2463629	It's a lot easier to weed out the... It is.
2463649	2464931	It is.
2464951	2465672	For sure.
2465692	2466593	The Unwantables.
2467354	2473301	And honestly, Facebook has been, and I know, I shouldn't be on it and I shouldn't use it.
2473481	2479448	I feel like in some ways this is a necessary evil for promotion, but I'm sort of able to cross-post from Instagram.
2479468	2480369	That's what people say about Twitter.
2480950	2483713	But Facebook is...
2484487	2502968	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2503522	2509288	The only thing that has gotten me to look at Twitter recently is the simple fact that there's a DBD meetup.
2509889	2511631	And it's the only place the information is posted.
2512452	2521842	The only thing I've really been seeing on... I go to Facebook for is to read the people complaining in the neighborhood, like the local city chats.
2522583	2531453	But it just makes you realize how people are in the public, which is bad.
2532057	2532437	All right.
2532738	2553342	Anyway, as Joan Hunter-Matt in chat says, be less like Randy and more like Yoshi P. Well, what a good transition to our next story to talk a little bit about what is going on with Final Fantasy XIV and the fact that, you know, Yoshi P has been, who of course is the producer of that game, Naoki Yoshida, who has worked on other games like Final Fantasy XVI.
2553442	2559389	He's, you know, a pretty popular guy because he did revive Final Fantasy XIV literally from the dead.
2559950	2560731	Um...
2560711	2582382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2582362	2598413	I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company and he says that he's more of a businessman than necessarily a creative in Final Fantasy XIV kind of interesting sort of take on it but I think realistic to like where he's at at this point um
2598393	2604022	He's not bored with the project because there is so much more he still wants to do with the game.
2604042	2620367	He says,
2620347	2621148	Same.
2622210	2637073	Yeah.
2637053	2663837	you know sort of situation especially Naoki Yoshida who is so popular he gets pulled into these other things like wasn't he I don't remember if that's still the case but he got pulled onto Square's board about Final Fantasy at some point because because of the fact that Final Fantasy 14 is still a money machine for Square Square makes more money off of Final Fantasy 14 than most of their games right now sadly including Final Fantasy 16 which was something that Naoki Yoshida was also a part of but
2664307	2670338	I think also 16 was extremely limited by being a PlayStation 5 exclusive at the time that it came out.
2670638	2678732	They're trying to get that to more places, but I don't know how many more people still want to play Final Fantasy 16 at this point that haven't yet.
2678953	2683360	SGO100Matt says, Yoshi P seems like he's working too hard.
2683681	2688930	Maybe he should take a break on things and work on a fun project like a Chrono Trigger remake.
2691577	2696902	Him and Sakurai should start a club and it should be like, don't call us.
2696962	2697582	That's the club.
2697662	2699584	Do not call.
2699604	2700325	Do not call.
2701566	2702186	Please do not.
2702647	2703227	Please do not.
2703928	2705109	We're busy making a game.
2705189	2705830	Do not call.
2706510	2707851	That's what him and Sakurai should do.
2708112	2710193	You're not going to ask us for anything.
2710213	2712596	We're going to make the game we want to make and you're going to like it.
2714377	2715858	That's my dream collab right there.
2715899	2719862	Yoshi P and Sakurai making a game that you have no input on.
2721968	2724791	You, the gamer, have no input on this game.
2725111	2726893	You are not allowed to say anything.
2726913	2727874	You're just going to buy it.
2728454	2732298	That's how it is.
2732318	2732799	Oh, yeah.
2733119	2735501	D'Artencio says, don't forget about Katsuhiro.
2735822	2737183	Don't ask me for shit.
2737203	2738704	Harada from Tekken.
2738724	2739705	Excellent call-out.
2740106	2740866	Excellent call-out.
2740886	2743409	Should absolutely be an advisor on that game as well.
2744190	2744870	So there we go.
2746332	2750676	Sakurai, Yoshida, Harada,
2751280	2752521	Sakurai Yoshida Harada.
2752561	2754643	I guess we can't really get an acronym out of that.
2754904	2757847	But those three get together and you're not going to say shit.
2758087	2760770	You're just going to buy the game and you don't get to talk.
2760790	2762311	Sit in the corner until it's done.
2762892	2767116	You sit in the waiting room and we'll call you when it's ready.
2767477	2768017	Sayoha?
2768377	2769038	I love it.
2769198	2769639	Sayoha.
2772081	2774704	Because it's their first syllables.
2774724	2777727	As long as it's not like a dirty word I'm not aware of, then great.
2778095	2779299	Not to my knowledge.
2780301	2780582	All right.
2781565	2782167	Let's move on.
2782729	2788746	I said there was some good news tonight, and I look at this and go, this is kind of neat to hear about, DarkSakura.
2789587	2790548	Indeed, indeed.
2791189	2800522	So, now you know that a lot of my focus of what I like to look at in the video game industry is the education and spreading of positivity.
2801483	2814801	And what an article I found is about indigenous video game makers who have done games in the Taino and Ojibwe languages.
2815722	2816623	They
2818105	2827276	I'm trying to see if I can find... A woman named Elaine Gomez who owns Midnight Hour Games.
2827757	2836287	She developed a game called The Vegigantes about the Vegigantes masks.
2836367	2844957	It's folklore and indigenous roots and was taking language classes in her...
2844937	2851884	The tribe that she belongs to, I'm going to mispronounce this, Higwayagua Taino of the Caribbean.
2852725	2858912	And so they decided to translate the Gigantes into that language.
2860013	2864218	And her chief was like, hey, you got to keep making these games.
2864958	2867261	And so there you go.
2867942	2873948	And trying to spread the culture and awareness of her ancestry.
2876020	2879805	These types of stories that make me go, video game is an art form, right?
2879825	2880966	It's about sharing a story.
2881027	2883810	It's about sharing a feeling.
2883850	2885332	It's about sharing a passion.
2886033	2890239	And I see that all those things are present in this type of game.
2890459	2893002	There's another game.
2894063	2899851	And this one, I'm going to mispronounce her name too, but Anagukwe Hermes Roach.
2899831	2922717	who is a designer and developer and co-director for Reclaim, being developed by Grassroots Indigenous Multimedia and grew up near the La Corte Reservation and made a game dedicated.
2925802	2926483	So there we go.
2926603	2931287	I'm actually trying to see if I just realized I can... You can find the links to it?
2931428	2934170	Yeah, I'm actually trying to get a little bit of what the game looks like here.
2934190	2934771	There we go.
2934791	2935832	I found a little YouTube.
2935892	2939556	I mean, it's a pre-alpha, but at least you can see a little bit of what this game looks like.
2939576	2940857	Let's try to get past the title screen.
2940877	2941237	There we go.
2941317	2943059	It has a really cool art style.
2943079	2944160	It looks like it's all hand-drawn.
2945381	2952709	I will link what I have as well for the game studios and whatnot in the chat.
2953109	2954070	But...
2954793	2975459	MidnightHourGames.com and it's G-I-M-O-J-I-B-W-E.org So we have GolfIndigoMike-OscarJulietIndigoBravoWhiskeyEcho.org Nice.
2975659	2977141	The art style in this game is really cool.
2977301	2977982	I like this.
2978300	2980462	Yeah, it's really striking to me.
2981083	2985708	And when I saw that, I was like, I might have to wait.
2985748	2986509	I have a backlog.
2987470	2990913	But I wanted to bring it up and showcase these games.
2991173	2992935	Yeah, cool.
2992955	2994237	All right.
2994257	2997440	Well, let's move on from low budget to big budget, Loki.
2998441	2999883	I should say indie, not low budget.
2999903	3000944	That sounds demeaning.
3000964	3003006	Indie to big budget, Loki.
3003026	3003126	Okay.
3003477	3020185	Exactly, so Metroid Prime 4 we know is looking pretty impressive, but apparently there's some information that has leaked allegedly saying that it is also the most expensive project Nintendo has undertaken.
3020786	3025894	That it had a $100 million budget.
3025914	3026295	Um...
3026663	3030969	Yeah, it says Prime costs about, well, they said $10 million.
3031049	3033072	Oh, Prime 1 costs $10 million to make.
3033372	3036537	Prime 4 is costing about $100 million to make.
3036817	3040102	The game needs to sell between $4.5 to $5 million to break even.
3040482	3042886	Yeah, I don't think it's going to have a problem doing that.
3043687	3047212	I don't think it's going to be a problem for them to sell that either, to be honest, especially during the holidays.
3049335	3054021	Yeah, when asked about how he obtained the figures, that's what I've been told.
3054575	3056039	Alright, we'll take your word for it.
3056139	3065563	My uncle works at Nintendo, so he knows Mario personally, and this is the information that Mario gave him.
3065847	3067769	Sure.
3067789	3089357	Yeah, we'll see what ends up being...
3089337	3098431	Well, I think it also is why, you know, the flip side of that is also why I think there were some people that were surprised when this was announced that it was coming for the original Switch.
3098451	3105262	I think people at some point felt, oh, because it was rebooted, because it's been so long, this is a Switch 2 sort of launch game.
3105302	3108087	And to be fair, I think I had that perspective for a hot minute.
3108107	3108848	But when you kind of
3108828	3136962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3136942	3142155	and or even myself and I don't want to spend all that money on a Switch 2 but I'm going to get him a new game.
3142175	3143318	This is available on the Switch.
3143679	3150276	So I do think Metroid Prime 4 does fine and makes his money back because it is on the original Switch no matter how crappy it runs.
3151353	3168872	DarkSakura,
3169443	3171066	Yeah, it should be cool.
3171086	3174371	And yes, Tigerclaw says we have Samus riding a motorcycle.
3174391	3175794	Yes, there is.
3175814	3178618	Everybody rides motorcycle now in Nintendo.
3178879	3189797	I'll tell you right now, as if my anticipation for Tron Ares couldn't get shot in the foot any harder, all I have to tell you is that, reminder, it's a Disney movie and...
3189878	3191903	That's all I have to say, right?
3192424	3194128	Y'all can read between the lines right now, right?
3194549	3201306	So, like, I'm more excited about Metroid Prime 4 and its light cycle races than anything else right now.
3201944	3203447	I listened to the soundtrack.
3203687	3205411	I was kind of underwhelmed.
3205691	3207855	It's not as good as the last one.
3208276	3209378	It was never going to be.
3209719	3212885	I understand that, but Nine Inch Nails is good as well.
3214709	3218416	Wendy Carlos could rise from the dead and do the soundtrack and it still wouldn't be.
3218596	3219197	She's not dead.
3219618	3220239	I thought she was.
3220600	3221742	Oh my god.
3221722	3222904	I thought she was!
3223185	3226029	But she could rise from the dead if she wanted to as well.
3226430	3228353	You know, that's how talented she is.
3228373	3229996	No, Wendy Carlos is still alive.
3230237	3231198	Okay, oh my god.
3231499	3232100	Sorry, Wendy.
3232140	3233663	She's pretty old.
3233683	3234785	I mean, she was born in 1939.
3234825	3239032	She's 85 years old and still going strong in Rhode Island.
3239052	3239913	Well, that's embarrassing.
3239933	3240494	Sorry, Wendy.
3240655	3243079	I thought there was a story that came out.
3243099	3244782	Maybe I'm mixing up with another composer.
3244902	3244962	No.
3244942	3246764	I do still want to see Tron Ares.
3246925	3249788	I just, I haven't, I just, it's like, I'm going to see it.
3250369	3250770	Yar.
3251150	3255576	It's, it's, it's, it's just like, I don't know though.
3255917	3257539	I see everything Tron that's happening.
3259982	3262546	It says Jared Leto.
3262806	3264088	Why Jared Leto?
3264108	3264648	Why?
3265570	3265870	I know.
3266592	3266933	All right.
3267675	3269098	Well, let's go back.
3269198	3271343	Let's talk about another big budget game.
3271383	3274330	At least, you know, especially in other countries, this game is huge.
3274771	3279983	It's Football Manager 26, but this is the kind of football that, you know, is real footballers.
3280003	3280545	It's actual football.
3280565	3282750	Yeah, we call it in the States soccer.
3283151	3283251	Yeah.
3283231	3302252	Football Manager 26 is going to include the officially licensed Barclays Women's Super League and National Women's Soccer League and other women's competition.
3303153	3311702	I can't believe I'm saying this, but this marks the first time that women's soccer has been featured in the long-running management sim.
3313859	3320546	And it's the year 2025, or on the box, 2026, and here we are.
3320907	3324370	Now, the debut of women's soccer was announced back in 2021.
3325091	3331038	It was supposed to come out in Football Manager 2025, but that game was canceled.
3331058	3339647	Sports Interactive instead switched the attention to Football Manager 26, which is coming out on November 4th.
3339627	3356742	When the developer was kind of asked about this early on, the prospects of adding women's soccer and football to the various game modes, they said they were only going to do so once it was able to offer the same level of depth and authenticity as it does for men's soccer.
3357110	3361356	And of course, the popularity of women's soccer has grown enormously throughout the world.
3361376	3373394	And Sports Interactive has said that for Football Manager 2026, there is one ecosystem and you are not exclusively limited to men or women's soccer on one save.
3373614	3381866	In ensuring that the recreation of women's soccer is realistic, they consulted real life players, clubs, organization, managers, the people involved.
3382046	3382968	That's great news.
3382988	3383809	Cool.
3383789	3387473	14 playable leagues across 11 nations at launch.
3387573	3390797	Leagues in Germany, France, Japan, Australia, and more.
3390937	3391898	England, the US.
3392619	3397624	Apparently the database for Football Manager 26, 36,000 players.
3398265	3401569	And that takes 40 researchers to make this game.
3401609	3403010	That's why this is a big budget game.
3403030	3404993	But these games are huge.
3405033	3411400	I mean, it's not EA, but it's still like, you know, these soccer games worldwide are tremendously popular.
3411760	3412581	So...
3412561	3416506	But congratulations on finally getting on board with this.
3416927	3422534	SGO 100 Matt also points out, you know, kind of the growth in other forms of media.
3422614	3429223	Over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, SGO 100 Matt says the women's leagues have been getting good amount of TV play internationally.
3429243	3431266	So that has changed in recent time.
3431727	3435852	And to all this, I say WNBA next, please.
3437182	3447713	Before you bring out all the receipts on ways the WNBA has been represented, this is completely stemmed from my sour grapes over the fact that we haven't had the Monarchs here locally in years.
3449655	3451957	So until the Monarchs are back, I'm always going to bitch.
3452438	3457022	A while back, they were great and it was really nice talking with them.
3457263	3461687	I mean, back when I was at my old job.
3462005	3464289	I've had so much fun when I went to Monarchs games.
3464309	3466432	They were just, it's a different vibe.
3466532	3468195	It's like, how do I put this?
3468816	3473764	It's less serious, but not in a negative way.
3473784	3476508	Like it just feels fun.
3476528	3476769	Anyway.
3477610	3477710	Yeah.
3477730	3478812	All right.
3479273	3481516	It seems to me there's more love there.
3481536	3482338	Yeah.
3482358	3488788	And it is wild to me that we had a world championship team here in Sacramento and they got rid of them.
3490540	3491501	Stupid.
3492122	3495768	Anyway, maybe some other sport good stuff.
3495788	3498572	Yeah, DarkSakura?
3498592	3499032	Maybe.
3500374	3512171	So, we know we are big Kunio fans in this house, and there are more Kunio games that are being localized coming out in the US for the first time.
3513894	3520463	We are getting River City Ball and Brawl Bundle.
3520443	3541118	being published by RetroBit which the two games that are there is River City Basketball or Neketsu Koha Ganbare Basket and then there's also River City Fighting Legend Neketsu Kalto Densetsu
3541098	3546505	So the first one, the basketball games, is Kunio gets a trip to the U.S.
3546525	3551671	on a quiz show and goes to play at a basketball tournament.
3552372	3563125	And then in the fighting legend, Kunio has a note on his locker that says there's a fighting tournament, and of course he's going to fight.
3564587	3568611	So it is a full set.
3568632	3569873	You get...
3571507	3573510	Let's see what we have here.
3573530	3583346	So we have... The whole thing is going to be €109.99, €129.99, and Canadian €154.99.
3586051	3589056	So it will have... Let's see.
3589456	3592782	So this first official cartridge release outside of Japan.
3592802	3597750	A Zanshin cartridge for 8-bit consoles.
3597730	3605641	Number Deluxe Hardcover Cartridge Packaging, Full Colored Instruction Manual, Exclusive Acrylic Cartridge Display Stand.
3606803	3615756	And that's if you get... That's just for River City Fighting Legend, and it alone would be $60 US.
3617058	3618760	And then...
3618740	3642486	basketball it would be again $60 US on its own and it comes with again the cartridge release street chalk cartridge for 8-bit consoles number deluxe hardcover cartridge packaging full color instruction manual exclusive acrylic cartridge display stand I just want a poster
3643715	3647439	That's a lot of fun stuff to come with this, and it's kind of neat that this is happening.
3647479	3652585	I mean, it's maybe, you know, 30 years too late, but it's never too late, but you know.
3652605	3654567	That's a lot of hot-blooded action.
3654587	3655728	Yeah, it sure is.
3655868	3657130	Dang, Kunio gets around.
3657991	3661735	He can play dodgeball, and basketball, and baseball.
3663417	3668362	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, I was wondering why it was so expensive until I realized it was an 8-bit console cart.
3668422	3669283	Yeah.
3669652	3675044	And then also, you know, those things might be a little more expensive right now just because I don't need to explain it to you.
3675085	3675586	Y'all know why.
3676147	3676368	So.
3678893	3681860	No, really?
3681960	3685669	Moving on, Loki, from from classics to new stuff.
3686189	3694621	Yes, Microsoft is, of course, shoving Copilot into every goddamn thing you don't want it to be in.
3694762	3695583	And guess what?
3696124	3701071	The Xbox mobile app is not immune to that crap.
3701271	3702173	And so guess what?
3702213	3702813	It's coming!
3703895	3705918	Your Copilot that you don't want.
3707460	3708602	I love my Mac.
3710911	3714855	Some stupid little child poking and going, hey, you're going the wrong way.
3714976	3716283	Hey, you're going the wrong way.
3716404	3717732	Yeah, Clippy's back.
3719365	3722610	No, Clippy being back would be way better than this crap.
3722650	3727136	No, Clippy got melted into a microchip and now he powers Copilot.
3727617	3731643	Clippy got melted down into a computer chip that now powers Copilot.
3732364	3733605	Clippy's better than that.
3733645	3739874	I can turn off Apple Intelligence and I can tell Siri to shut the fuck up.
3741076	3743820	She says she doesn't like when I talk like that, but still.
3744526	3745987	I will throw this out here, though.
3746268	3748670	Like, you know, I don't love this either.
3748790	3764226	However, in the interest of looking at a story from all angles, I know that many people, when they get stuck in a video game, are going to go to Google or they're going to go to Bing, maybe, and they're going to type their question, like, where is the exit in World 3 or, you know, whatever it is.
3764967	3772735	And oftentimes what's going to generate right off the bat is going to be Gemini or whatever the Google's AI thing is called with the answer to that.
3773015	3773115	Yeah.
3773095	3774818	It's wrong half the time.
3775058	3776741	That's a key point.
3777062	3781409	But aren't a lot of people sort of already relying on this, I guess is my point.
3781429	3782191	What's the point?
3782531	3783553	What is the point here?
3783573	3785035	To collect more data on you?
3785316	3790665	If I'm searching for whatever this is, like the question that I have, like...
3791810	3794012	You're gonna have the same data.
3794032	3801400	Like, if I'm using Bing or using the Microsoft Search or whatever, like, I just don't see the point of shoving this into every single app.
3801420	3803242	Like, I know I don't use it.
3803642	3812171	And, like, even I had a coworker try to use it for, like, generating AI images for something funny.
3812191	3814133	And, like, they could not get it to work right.
3815334	3816315	It's just...
3816397	3816978	It's dumb.
3817919	3826288	And Jamie, I was going to ask when you're telling Siri to shut the hell up, did you go, I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.
3829672	3832556	No, I'm just like, I wasn't talking to you.
3833217	3834538	Okay.
3835119	3838102	Or, that's not what I asked, bitch.
3839444	3840565	Please watch your language.
3841304	3865185	SSJ100Matt says physical game manuals and guides died for this actually no they existed so that all of the words inside of them could be stolen I mean it's I know jokes are funny and the truth isn't always funny but that's my honest answer to that
3866465	3877167	and yet with all of that information at its fingertips it can't fucking answer questions correctly or do proper math most of the time so a funny thing to do
3878243	3904909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3904889	3923725	and I bet most of you don't even know what half these fucking buttons do on this thing it's not using it for math necessarily like using it for like math problems you know people do though I'm sure they do but like it's more of like I've used it for building for me for numbers
3924042	3930388	Yeah, it's more of being unable to do simple things like, hey, I am giving you this word.
3930448	3931749	How many letters are in this word?
3931889	3933590	And it gets it wrong every time.
3933670	3939535	Or, hey, count the number of times the letter T appears in this word, and it can't do that.
3939676	3947703	Like, that's the simple things that it just gets confused on, which I don't understand how it can't count.
3948423	3952247	I mean, you can code something to count, you know, the characters in a string.
3952267	3952767	Like, I
3954772	3958216	You would think you would know how to do that.
3958757	3963923	Fifth Dream says also you can just type math into Google and it tells you the answer right in the search bar.
3964003	3966466	And to be fair, that is a thing that Google did before AI.
3967047	3968769	And it is useful.
3968809	3973875	Like if you're like how many quarts in so many teaspoons or whatever.
3973895	3977539	It will do those conversions of things I can never remember.
3977823	3984310	I was trying to figure out like the mass of this container when it wasn't listed and I needed to measure how much food was in it.
3984511	3984851	Yeah.
3985512	3997366	And just put in the, you know, the one thing I do like is that on the sites where it will not just give you the answer, but it will also show you the calculation for it.
3997386	4007357	And that for me is better because at least if I have the formula and I'm not where I can do anything about it, I have a way to calculate it.
4007894	4009296	Jamie to all of her computers.
4009696	4012880	Now, don't forget to show your work on that math problem.
4014062	4017146	Well, honestly, though, it is good to see.
4018668	4024595	Yeah, I mean, I'm just saying it's what is going to make that be more, I guess, more accurate.
4025477	4032045	Accurate may not be the right word, but it shows that at least the calculation is following actual numbers.
4032430	4040424	Formula and Procedure and isn't just something that was pulled out of a computer ass.
4041667	4043730	Back in our day, we had legit calculators.
4043770	4047116	They were Texas instruments and you hacked it to play Dope Wars and Snake.
4047637	4049000	Hell fucking yeah.
4049381	4050743	We played Pole Position.
4051617	4056002	I had a friend who flat out programmed Pole Position on their graphing calculator.
4056703	4064553	Yeah, Pole Position was available when the big thing was running those in assembly so that they would be much higher performance and stuff.
4064573	4066135	Yeah, I remember Pole Position.
4066155	4079751	But yeah, essentially with any of the high school stuff, because we just went through the whole back to school night stuff, a lot of the things where there's concerns about AI use and abuse or whatever, they will just...
4080490	4086761	Make them do it on paper in class so that you can't use AI for that stuff.
4087061	4095917	Aside from, I think they were still using Grammarly and that type of stuff for proofreading, but not for actual generation of all that stuff.
4095937	4102208	Or maybe, I think there was another tool that was for citing sources or something that helps you find sources for things.
4102829	4104692	But, yeah, it's...
4105803	4106144	I don't know.
4106164	4108849	I don't think it's at a point where it's extremely useful yet.
4109350	4123660	Like, I would want it, like, more personalized and intuitive and not as some, like, sort of backdoor for them to advertise to me, which I have to say, despite the fact that, like,
4124045	4127110	I mean, literally every company is stealing all of my data, right?
4127330	4131276	Like, they still can't push accurate ads to me about what my interests are.
4131617	4134321	Like, I just, it boggles my mind.
4134341	4138547	Like, if you literally have all of my data, you still can't figure that out?
4138567	4140670	What makes you think AI is going to be any better at that?
4140791	4146940	Like, it's just, you are already bad at your job if you have all of the data and yet still don't know what I want.
4147741	4152769	Did you see my Blue Sky post about the Instagram ad I got pushed this week with the holiday sweaters?
4153745	4171669	I was getting pushed holiday sweaters on Instagram and it would be like a pink, I don't even know if I can say, like there's literally one of them, I can't say the word or we might get banned from Twitch, but there was one, I think I can say cunt, there was a sweater that was pink and it said cunt on it.
4171649	4172450	And that's just it.
4172470	4176197	It's a holiday sweater that I could wear to my aunt's house for a holiday.
4176337	4178180	Can you imagine me walking to the door with a pink holiday sweater?
4178200	4179483	Why don't I have this?
4179503	4184631	And there was a neon green one that had the F slur is the one that I don't think I can say.
4184692	4185433	The F slur.
4185994	4189460	I just want the one that says the other.
4189740	4196091	And then there was two, it looked like pixel art of two rats smoking.
4196392	4196492	Yeah.
4197232	4198774	on a holiday sweater.
4198895	4199716	Like why?
4200297	4204944	I might buy that one because that's the one I could actually probably get away with wearing on a stage somewhere.
4204964	4209631	But and then there was one that said ketamine and it was all like drawn and like chalk and stuff.
4209711	4212135	I was just like, what in the world?
4212155	4214418	And I'm like, why am I getting pushed these ads?
4214698	4217783	To which Alan replies, oh, that might be my fault.
4218424	4220387	And I'm like, what in the fuck are you looking at?
4222477	4223218	Yeah, they'll do that.
4223238	4228203	They'll advertise to other people in your household stuff that they think that you want.
4228403	4229224	But it's always wrong.
4229244	4231846	That is how Alan figured out my Christmas gift last year.
4232647	4237151	He knew to get me the Atari jacket because I was on Atari's site.
4237251	4240735	I wanted to see if they had a new version of the woodgrain hoodie that I really liked.
4240815	4242917	I just kind of wanted to see what clothes they had.
4242937	4249463	And I saw that leather jacket and I started looking at it and it started pushing Alan the ad for it because we live together.
4249443	4253417	and he ended up buying it because he's like, oh, Rob would probably like this.
4253437	4255163	And I was like, God damn it.
4255223	4258795	Don't let them know it's working.
4260698	4262220	Anyway.
4264083	4264924	Yeah, that's what I hate.
4264944	4266927	TigerClaw says sometimes it's an accident.
4267228	4270313	You open a page or something and then you get recommended stuff from it.
4270413	4271454	That's the worst.
4271534	4280909	Like, my fat finger tapped an Instagram ad and now I am forever getting ads for, like, I don't know, potpourri or something I don't fucking want.
4280929	4282090	It's just wild.
4282190	4283412	Anyway.
4283432	4284814	You don't want any potpourri.
4284854	4287879	You don't want things to smell like an attic.
4288881	4289862	Like grandma's house?
4292069	4297573	I remember when... Do you remember when, like, potpourri became really popular in the 80s?
4297653	4298557	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
4299220	4301691	And everywhere you went smelled like...
4303510	4307514	and Old Apothecary.
4307534	4307854	All right.
4308875	4313540	Before we get to the classic game of the week, I want to talk about this as a follow-up to something we talked about last week.
4313600	4322770	Remember the saga of the Sega dev kit that was bought at an auction type of thing or an unloading and then now it became a whole mess?
4323170	4327314	Well, an interesting twist in this whole thing.
4327334	4328736	It's full of cockroaches.
4328916	4330738	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4330758	4332960	It's covered in bees!
4333244	4337071	No, there's no B's that I know of.
4337091	4346910	Anyway, apparently the company that Sega used to clear the Brentford offices is a registered charity.
4346930	4348653	That's the latest twist.
4348673	4354324	So now Sega is now essentially accusing a charity of theft.
4354574	4359264	Now, there's a lot of on-edge people with this whole conversation and so forth.
4359284	4365278	There's a lot of allegedlys and maybes and he said, they said, she said thing going on here.
4365298	4372313	But that is the latest twist is that now apparently it was a charity organization, which I actually – there are like –
4372293	4385948	Why do you hear the commercials on the radio or whatever all the time about donate your car to this charity and then it's a tax write-off for you and they turn around and sell you a car and they make the money, they get people to donate their time to fix up cars.
4386969	4389953	So yes, charities do get involved in this sort of work sometimes.
4390313	4392936	So that's not outside, I mean, I know it's Britain.
4393597	4396760	I don't know about this.
4396780	4400224	Because, you know, that'd be like if I was...
4400204	4408699	I had my massive estate sale and our fine diamonds got mixed up with the linens and we accidentally donated it to Goodwill.
4408939	4415871	Am I going to go sue Goodwill or try to get my diamonds back because I'm a dumbass that just accidentally threw that stuff out?
4415891	4424406	No, but I've seen the girl whose parents in the estate sale or grandparents had the photo album donated to Goodwill found the book and bought it for like a dime.
4425179	4440020	Yeah, I mean, like, that's fine if you repurchase your stuff, but, like, there should be no expectation that, like, oh, well, you gave this stuff to them and you didn't know what you had, so... Tough beans, like, I don't know, like... Just let it go.
4441782	4446869	No one's gonna be, you know, getting any sort of industry secrets based off this crap.
4448051	4450314	Yeah, I mean... Ugh, never mind.
4451396	4451897	These people.
4452197	4452958	I can't...
4453225	4459675	Alright, let's go to our next segment and look back fondly on something in gaming's history.
4470250	4477581	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4478042	4480245	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4481339	4483142	DarkSakura, this is an interesting one.
4483222	4484725	Excited to hear about this.
4484765	4487470	What is your pick for the classic game of the week?
4487490	4493561	It's a game I've been waiting to do just because it's... It was a fun game.
4493661	4495164	It's Drunken Robot Pornography.
4496887	4497528	It's got a great name.
4497548	4498650	Had the best intro song.
4501254	4501575	But...
4501825	4504870	Anyway, drunken robot pornography.
4504990	4507354	There's a bit of a story about this.
4510438	4517910	For a post that was by one of the developers of the game,
4517890	4547813	DejaVon Games
4548248	4557056	This, yeah, some people, there are people who call it DRP, but people just call it drunken robot pornography because that's its name.
4557677	4562721	But anyway, you play Ruben, a bar owner who gave his robot bartender Tim's sentence.
4563242	4575893	And after Tim listened to all the pages at the bar, he said the best way to cure humanity is, you know, suffers from widespread depression, was to build a 30-story tall robot to destroy it, or several of them.
4575873	4585329	You have to save the city of Boston Sky from Tim and his robot centerfolds.
4585349	4587112	That's exactly how it's described.
4591319	4592160	This game...
4593457	4595700	I had a lot of fun with it.
4595720	4597082	It made me really motion sick.
4597142	4606796	To me, there were aspects of jumping flash in it and all kinds of running and gunning craziness and it was wonderful.
4606916	4611482	So yeah, you wear a robot suit and you go around and you fight other robots.
4614666	4615768	So...
4617115	4626957	The Digibond Games also did one in 2008 called The Wonderful End of the World and one called A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.
4628050	4635400	The thing about this game is that it was announced on April 1st, 2010 as an April Fool's joke, and it came out on February 19th, 2014.
4636942	4639966	And, I mean, people gave it kind of mixed reviews.
4639986	4641849	Some people didn't really care for it.
4641869	4644472	I thought this game was hilarious, and I had a lot of fun with it.
4644613	4648958	I mean, I wasn't very good at it, I will freely admit that, but I had a lot of fun with it.
4650320	4652443	I mean, you can still get it on Steam.
4652523	4653805	It's like...
4653785	4677548	14 bucks if you pay 30 you can get three copies and share them with friends so that's nice um but yeah you have jetpacks and guns and go around and and stop Tim and his uh and instead of that they burn down your bar how can you let that go but yeah it's also really pretty
4677882	4680226	But it has the best opening song ever.
4681207	4688578	And there's a Kotaku quote that says, I'd play this game even if it wasn't called Drunken Robot Pornography.
4690281	4698253	I think that's a really smart way to get more of your game, like offer the bulk sales thing, offer the Costco plan on your game.
4698714	4705324	Like that's really smart, especially if it's like multiplayer, like 30 bucks for you and two other people to get the game is actually a really smart marketing tactic.
4706992	4715179	Yeah, and honestly, it looks like there's some other neat games that have come out since.
4716600	4728971	They've kind of fallen off of my radar for a while because they had done some pretty neat games and they're trying to sell sentient ice cream.
4729211	4734236	Oh, this website template allows us to add food items to our page.
4734256	4736998	We're not a restaurant, but if we were, here's some of the things we might offer.
4737417	4738799	Bison-Bear combo.
4740221	4741923	Natural dancers.
4741943	4742484	Interesting.
4742784	4746529	I knew a guy in gaming podcasting that left to go sell ice cream.
4746549	4747570	That's interesting.
4748191	4755380	The people at DejaVon are very interesting people.
4755660	4756742	The website's actually pretty funny.
4756762	4761568	But I just like also that they have a game called... Literally.
4762477	4765504	I have to say, as much as you talked about this game, I never played it myself.
4765845	4767228	I think I probably need to at some point.
4768471	4771419	Maybe you should get the friend pack and share it with your friends.
4771439	4772662	Well, you already have a copy, right?
4772842	4773544	I'm assuming you do.
4773844	4774225	I do.
4775148	4776391	Well, then who do I share it with?
4776411	4778355	I guess Alan would be an obvious choice.
4778375	4778696	Loki?
4779137	4780300	You want a copy of the game, Loki?
4781478	4782480	I probably already have one.
4783721	4784162	Exactly.
4784523	4787567	Are we sure it wasn't in like a... Ooh, it's angry.
4787748	4788889	I do like the little captions.
4789210	4790231	OLR giveaway!
4792595	4797723	I don't have a copy, but I'm okay.
4798124	4802230	I would just throw it in the pile anyways if I had a copy.
4802630	4803131	Exactly.
4803151	4805595	We'd have to put this in Minecraft in order for you to play it, right?
4806841	4808063	Oh, nope, I took it back.
4808203	4810206	I have it already.
4810226	4810566	Ah, funny.
4811147	4812509	I already have it, yeah.
4812529	4813069	Funny, funny.
4813089	4813390	All right.
4814591	4815252	Is that everything then?
4816654	4817896	Yeah, that's it.
4818056	4823263	I wish we could hear some of the opening song, but... We might be able to, actually.
4823283	4824404	Is it in the beginning of this video?
4825306	4826668	It's the very beginning, yeah.
4827128	4829772	You guys won't hear it on Discord, but I'm going to play a little bit.
4829792	4833777	Just be quiet for me for a moment, and I will play some of it here for the listeners.
4835056	4847131	So this is the theme song to the game that DarkSakura was just speaking about.
4847231	4852357	Yeah, it goes actually really long and this sadly gets cut off.
4852677	4858705	If you want to hear the rest, you'll just have to buy the game or look it up on YouTube, I guess.
4858885	4859486	So there you go.
4860447	4862329	Drunken Robot Pornography.
4863592	4868760	I like that this is another game that I've enjoyed that started off as an April Fool's joke.
4870583	4873387	We love April Fool's games that become real games.
4873407	4874889	Pokemon Go is the one that comes to mind for me.
4876451	4880077	Let's cover some other headlines in gaming rapidly in Rapid Fire News.
4880097	4881499	Let's go to Loki.
4882778	4890533	Yeah, so we got the final Crossworlds DLC promotion, or at least the franchise it's going to be with.
4890913	4899149	This came from an early leaked copy of the game that was out there from retail, and it's Mega Man.
4899470	4902235	Also, it was confirmed by Sonic City Net.
4902255	4903858	They were the ones that posted the
4903838	4908405	The screenshot or the photo of the DLC brochure.
4909106	4911049	But yes, Mega Man is going to be in there.
4911390	4919803	And also, I think it was also confirmed on X as well by the official account showing that it's going to be, I think, Mega Man base.
4920825	4921566	Or no, Proto Man.
4922107	4923990	Mega Man and Proto Man were in there.
4923970	4926213	I think possibly the racers that are going to be in there.
4926734	4927676	But I'm excited.
4927936	4930820	I want to make it Mega Man and Minecraft in one game.
4930961	4932122	They're speaking my language.
4932543	4936088	So yeah, I will have to check this out when it comes out next week.
4937130	4945242	And then along with that, we're getting some more roster updates for the new Marvel Cosmic Invasion beat-em-up game.
4945803	4952273	And now, of course, their latest trailer, they showed off Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider.
4952354	4960345	I don't know what the difference between Cosmic Ghost Rider and Ghost Rider is, but it is Ghost Rider.
4960365	4961347	But he's got a space helmet.
4961367	4962308	Is he a motorcycle hero?
4963430	4964611	He's a space hero.
4965973	4967655	Space motorcycle, maybe?
4967675	4970459	Who knows?
4970479	4971901	It's Frank Castle, Brad.
4972142	4977349	See, I stopped reading any of the Ghost Rider stuff except for like Helverine.
4979337	4980159	Interesting.
4980179	4983064	So the former Punisher is now Ghost Rider.
4985850	4986551	Weird.
4987092	4987793	Good job, Marvel!
4990078	4992823	Alright, well let's go over to DarkSakura with a quick headline.
4994592	5009407	Yas, so Sega has put out a trademark for Arcade Paradise and they have some unannounced games that they're going to reveal at Tokyo Game Show and this could be one of them or it could be a compilation.
5009467	5011572	Who knows what it is, but they've got it.
5014724	5015305	Exciting.
5016867	5018429	Yes.
5018449	5019990	Wonderful, beautiful, exciting.
5020551	5027960	Less exciting is the news that some Evercade cartridges are moving into the Legacy program, which means they will no longer be made.
5028060	5030864	So they exist, but they are no longer being actively made.
5031765	5037151	As of December 2025, the four cartridges are the Pico Interactive Collection 2.
5037993	5041677	This collection had Beast Ball, Eliminator Boat Duel, Hulk,
5041657	5045683	Hoops, Shut Up and Jam 1 and 2, Soccer Kids, Summer Challenge, Winter Challenge.
5045723	5052912	It's a lot of sports games, so maybe if that isn't your jam, you probably don't really care unless you're a collector about it.
5053113	5056838	But also, this one kind of surprises me, the Indie Heroes Collection 1.
5056858	5058019	There's a lot of games in this.
5058039	5063547	There's 14 games, which is a lot for an EverQuest cartridge, which has a variety of different indie games.
5063527	5087222	Indie Heroes Collection 1 Megacat Studios Collection 2 Alter Ego, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Julie Cat, and
5088890	5091873	It's just... I can't believe this is real life.
5093015	5094616	Yazi, Roniu's Tale.
5094636	5098921	I'm going to be honest, not a lot of games I've recognized these names of, but cool.
5099962	5103887	Unless, you know, the fact that if you don't already have this cartridge, you're probably going to have a hard time getting it.
5103907	5106449	And then the last one, the Sydney Hunter Collection.
5106470	5107350	I've heard of these games.
5107371	5108592	There's three in this collection.
5108872	5111235	And then a random game, throw them in there as well, called Jester.
5112136	5115119	So this is all from Collector Vision Games.
5115540	5118643	So these four are now in Legacy status.
5118623	5119985	and are no longer going to be available.
5120085	5123029	Evercade is still cranking out new cartridges though.
5123109	5126514	They have some newer collections they just opened for pre-order.
5126534	5129718	I want to say a Rare collection is coming.
5129738	5137729	There's an Activision collection coming too, which actually kind of surprised me because that means Evercade and Microsoft have a deal because Microsoft is...
5137709	5147659	and Microsoft has their own retro thing, but they have an Activision collection coming, which I think sounds pretty cool because I think there might be some games in here that aren't in Microsoft's thing.
5148039	5150942	I don't know if the Microsoft thing had Star Master or Sky Jinx.
5151022	5151482	It might.
5151502	5155386	I don't have them all memorized and they do a terrible job of updating us when they have new stuff.
5156127	5159610	Neo Geo Arcade 2, 3 is coming out soon.
5160391	5161812	They have a lot of stuff on the horizon.
5161872	5163754	So Evercade's far from dead.
5163794	5167598	In fact, it seems like it's growing, but those four cartridges will no longer be available.
5168877	5177687	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some newer games that are coming out this week in world release dates.
5177767	5179292	Loki, let's start with the U.S.

5291389	5296178	Rezlorania and the Red Alchemist and the White Guardian.
5296478	5297199	Too long of a name.
5297600	5298341	Gus, get better.
5299423	5303069	On PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5303089	5304572	We have...
5304552	5321970	Clendon X3 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 EA Sports FC 26 on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series that's the biggest video game in the world if I'm not mistaken
5321950	5323392	That is a pretty big one.
5323412	5326718	Yep, that's full of microtransactions and gambling for kids.
5326758	5332648	Hotel Barcelona on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5332668	5342524	And finally, Pac-Man World 2 Repack on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5343618	5346082	All right, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases there.
5346282	5349627	EA Sports FC 26, of course, is releasing in Japan.
5349647	5352151	Like I said, I don't think there is a bigger video game in the world.
5352893	5354034	So that is on its way out.
5354335	5364010	Also on the Switch 2, there's a variety of peripherals and things like new cases and things from third parties.
5364070	5365913	But we also have...
5366416	5367319	Oh no, that's next week.
5367359	5368442	Okay, so that's it for Switch 2.
5368542	5368924	Just kidding.
5369465	5370549	How about the PlayStation 5?
5370829	5374661	Silent Hill F, of course, is on its way out for the PlayStation 5, also in Japan.
5374721	5377911	And no, Tigerclaw does not mean Silent Hill fucks.
5377992	5382259	I don't know if we, do we know the meaning behind the F or is that to be revealed through the story?
5382399	5383280	We might.
5383300	5384122	Okay.
5384142	5385323	So we'll see.
5385464	5391413	Also out on the PlayStation 5, Sonic Racing Crossworlds, which that is the game that Tigerclaw fucks with.
5391573	5392615	I know that for a fact.
5392735	5395039	So, but I'll be fucking with it too.
5395079	5398764	I'm looking forward to Sonic Racing Crossworlds because those games are pretty good.
5399706	5403572	Mama Rukun Recurse is also out in Japan on the PS5 this week.
5403872	5405535	Poppy Playtime Triple Pack.
5405515	5408318	Yes, gets its own release in Japan this week.
5408539	5412444	Neon Blood, also releasing in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.
5412984	5421154	And Atelier Resloriana, the Red Alchemist and the White Guardian, which I think Loki also mentioned for the US, that is also out in Japan.
5421234	5424178	That looks like a worldwide one this week.
5424258	5432428	But in Japan, of course, you can get the regular, you can get the premium box, and you can get the special collection box.
5432448	5434611	What's in the special collection box?
5435063	5437871	A bunch of crap.
5438212	5439515	Stickers, postcards.
5441340	5441962	That's it.
5442182	5442383	No.
5442764	5444709	It doesn't look like one of the Paltrow's heads in this version.
5444729	5447075	You have to probably pre-order a different version for that.
5448359	5449883	Gold edition, I guess.
5450032	5453599	EA Sports FC 26, of course, is on that console as well.
5453639	5458668	Fuck, they would probably release EA Sports FC 26 on the ZX Spectrum if they thought they'd sell 100 copies.
5460311	5460912	Let's see.
5461153	5465361	I think that's about it for this week's releases, but still a pretty big week in releases.
5465421	5468747	It's only going to get busier as the weeks continue.
5468807	5469829	DarkSakura, how about the U.K.

5567823	5568724	All right.
5568744	5578197	Before we get to the listener roundtable, your emails, your comments, your blue skeets, all that stuff, we will get to one more stories from Loki.
5578217	5578598	All right.
5579439	5585287	Well, unfortunately, we live in a world where people are... I mean, okay.
5585928	5586469	So...
5587580	5594030	Making light of someone's death is not necessarily a good thing.
5594111	5597957	However, I think there's varying degrees of gray there.
5598618	5604347	Like, for example, if I was making fun of the death of Hitler, that might be fine.
5605449	5612440	But apparently one of those people was an artist at, of course...
5613702	5632842	Sucker Punch, who got fired because of their comments regarding the death of Charlie Kirk and basically made a comment saying that, you know, something to, oh, I hope the shooter's name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back.
5634024	5634445	I heard that.
5635657	5659504	um and then of course uh the artist Drew Harrison is no longer employed at Sucker Punch Productions because they were unhappy with his comments but there's also pressure from like external groups to try to get anybody fired for you know saying anything bad about the the mega MLK or was that 13th Apostle something like that that they want to call this hateful bigot of a person
5665373	5666395	That's the world we live in.
5667116	5669079	I have nothing to say on this.
5669119	5670161	Because that's the world we live in.
5672204	5675509	SJ100Matt in chat says, anyone who says anything gets in trouble over this.
5676551	5677873	That's where we're at in this world.
5679395	5681138	You know, we'll just all sit and think.
5681337	5684142	Alright, let's get to the Lister Roundtable and see what you all think.
5684222	5685164	You can send us emails.
5685284	5688049	Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com You can send us posts.
5688630	5691796	BlueSky at OrangeLawnRadio, our domain.
5691996	5694260	Or, excuse me, OrangeLawnRadio.com or what have you.
5695282	5698087	I thought somebody said they were going to send an email, but I didn't see any come in.
5698127	5699650	Did we get an email, DarkSakura?
5700355	5700756	Nope.
5701076	5704802	Alright, well, perhaps we just didn't.
5704822	5707947	But, I'm going to make a statement real quick.
5707967	5708127	Yeah.
5708748	5719765	The whole thing about not speaking ill of the dead, don't make fun of death and murder, definitely, but it's not speaking ill of the dead if you're speaking the truth.
5723963	5728107	Some people laugh at funerals because that's the only way they know how to process.
5728587	5734872	I'm pointing to a famous Mary Tyler Moore episode that I think explained a lot of these feelings that people have.
5734893	5747824	I'm not saying it's the same situation, but I am saying you have full license to when I pass away inevitably, which all humans do at some point, you have full license to roast me because I love a good roast.
5747964	5750146	So please make it funny.
5750166	5751207	That's all I ask.
5751227	5753869	Just make sure it's actually funny because there's a lot of jokes out there.
5753849	5772313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5772293	5783209	They are not responsible for any of this and blaming the complete other side, which has only talked about like, you know, hey, we need to be peaceful about this and all this stuff while they're still stoking things.
5783229	5785833	I mean, just today, still stoking things.
5785853	5787335	Like, it's just ridiculous.
5787355	5789158	It's disingenuous, obviously.
5789278	5795888	They're trying to create a bigger rift because they know that when the chaos dies down, they'll come out on top.
5797792	5801998	and Chaos is getting people to not talk about the Epstein files as well.
5802018	5806003	That's, you know... Oh, I'm not shutting up about that.
5806904	5812712	And then I think it's also... Oh, what else was I going to say this?
5812993	5814094	I just lost the train of thought.
5814354	5815796	Oh, I know what I was going to say.
5815957	5820382	I was going to say that, yeah, yeah, of course we should denounce gun violence.
5820403	5821804	It's terrible.
5822225	5823006	And...
5822986	5845247	There's a lot of us that have been denouncing-
5845227	5868400	Oh no, they're not gonna-
5868380	5870963	So I laughed at the irony.
5870983	5872225	I will say that.
5872385	5878053	I think many of us are ready to talk about how do we fix the gun problem in this country.
5878574	5882979	I know how we fix the country, but I can't say it.
5882999	5883760	Anyway.
5883780	5885763	And no, I'm not talking about violence.
5885863	5890549	I am talking about dismantling and reorganizing, but that's just me.
5891190	5892953	Due process.
5892973	5893293	All right.
5894595	5894775	Um...
5896122	5902350	So we don't have emails, but if you want to send us an email for our future week, participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send us emails.
5903232	5904333	What did you have for dinner, Rob?
5904493	5905555	The Blue Skies.
5905575	5908559	Actually, I haven't eaten dinner yet.
5908679	5909099	What?
5909460	5910561	Well, we got lunch.
5910621	5911863	I always eat dinner after the show.
5912003	5912864	I never eat dinner before.
5915708	5922597	Sundays are usually the day that Alan and I all do a DoorDash, which, yes, is expensive and we spoil ourselves.
5922838	5924039	I DoorDash Starbucks.
5924079	5924640	Don't even.
5925381	5926062	I'm not judging.
5926042	5932990	Well, also, because my husband is a Costco queen, he found that you can get like $100 worth of DoorDash cards for $90.
5933330	5936554	So, you know, we kind of filled up on the DoorDash cards there.
5937215	5940558	Are you now the DoorDashians?
5940578	5940979	Stop.
5941780	5942781	We DoorDashed ourselves.
5943081	5949889	I don't want to say it because they didn't pay me to endorse them, but one of those make your own pizza places, right?
5949989	5950750	There's like...
5950730	5954454	I love balsamic.
5954594	5969167	Loki.
5969208	5980298	Mm-hmm.
5980835	5981778	What'd you have?
5982800	5994473	Because this is the original studio now I had a togo sandwich I haven't had a togo sandwich in forever They keep closing them Yeah, the one by me closed Yeah
5995955	6000622	Anyway, I did want to mention any Blue Sky mentions that we have.
6000902	6007712	The only mention on our Blue Sky was actually a shout out from our friends over at GameBooey.org video game podcast.
6007732	6012158	I think I mentioned it last week that I'd recorded the episode, but it came out this week.
6012258	6014502	I will shout out our pals over at GameBooey.org.
6015363	6021051	I joined them to talk about music games and rhythm games because I had joined them for a show like 12 years ago.
6021031	6024476	and they are revisiting some of their old topics through like the new lens.
6024496	6026299	It was a really interesting look back.
6026379	6037636	So it's episode, you want to look for episode 182B but I would encourage you to listen to 182A and other selections from the Game Buoy catalog as well because Game Buoy is an excellent show.
6038697	6048712	Spike and Slag Kick are extremely well-spoken individuals and really do their homework when it comes to the, more than I do, when it comes to the gaming news.
6048732	6050515	So shout out for GameBuoy.org.
6050866	6059234	Funny, every so often, Psychic and I consider going back to that old WoW comic that we wanted to do ages and ages ago.
6059395	6059696	Mm-hmm.
6060800	6061743	Hillsbrad Blues.
6062164	6062646	Why not?
6062866	6063930	It'd be fun.
6064163	6066086	I gotta get all the models again.
6066206	6068309	You know where Slykick's name comes from too?
6068369	6069731	This is an interesting story to tell.
6069831	6075399	So Slykick, that name comes from the God Warrior lady on, what was it?
6075479	6080987	Swapping Wives or whatever that show was called on Fox years ago where she goes, it's tainted.
6081147	6081848	I don't want it.
6081928	6082869	Dark-sided.
6083010	6084151	Slykicks.
6084311	6086394	She's trying to say psychics, but she says Slykick.
6086434	6090180	And that's where he gets his name from is that whole thing.
6090640	6093985	I think it had to do with the...
6094150	6094513	No.
6095461	6098727	Condescending calling someone a slag.
6098875	6106884	It might be a double entendre, in which case I fully endorse, because I do like to joke, you know, oh, I'm going on with the slag, right?
6108306	6122102	But yes, because there was an excellent show called Slag Wars that starred the cock destroyers, which sadly, you know, one of them passed away a couple of years ago, which was really, and they had a fight and all this stuff.
6122122	6122502	Oh, yeah.
6123023	6124985	Oh, Slag Wars is hilarious.
6125005	6125606	No, it's great.
6125626	6125946	Yeah.
6125926	6127688	Don't you remember the Cock Destroyers?
6127928	6130350	They did all those YouTubes and stuff.
6130590	6131731	No, I don't.
6131751	6134794	It's these two gals that just talk really dirty.
6135634	6141980	It's over-the-top funny to me, but they actually had a reality TV show to find the world's next biggest slag.
6142781	6145443	It was dumb reality TV.
6146384	6148325	Reality TV ought to be a little stupid.
6148806	6153189	That's why I love The Traitors, because it's ridiculously over-the-top.
6153550	6154971	Why am I thinking...
6154951	6167233	is one of the most incredible reality show hosts we've ever had because he brings that right, unserious vibe to what otherwise is actually, like, people really get into that game.
6167253	6177371	But, like, the vibe of the show and the over-the-topness and kind of leaning into the excessiveness I think is what makes that show really fun at the end of the day.
6177612	6179575	So it's, yeah, anyway.
6180331	6184978	I was just thinking of that line from Golden Girls.
6185919	6186700	She's not a slut.
6186740	6188282	She is the slut.
6188302	6190285	I didn't finish my thought on Slykick's name though.
6190345	6195513	So that lady, no, that lady from Wife Swap or whatever it was, Marguerite Perrin was her name.
6195533	6198777	She's kind of back because of TikTok.
6198797	6200920	So she does a bunch of stuff.
6200940	6202282	And here's the thing about her.
6202663	6204886	You know, she's gone through some terrible loss.
6205046	6208431	She lost her daughter and her husband, I think.
6208411	6232984	I don't know.
6232964	6246236	And I think it has something to do with the fact, I don't know all the details, they would be her words, not mine, but the fact that they were kind of there for her when she needed people to lean on through all the tragedy she was going through.
6246256	6259148	So it's like a really, like she's become one of those like good religious people, the people that actually use their religion to lift up others, to do that sort of thing, as opposed to try to tear people down.
6259468	6262971	So I just love that for her and her journey.
6262951	6288705	and all that so look her up she's she's fun so um anyway i guess that's i guess that's it for me i'll i'll end on the god warrior note why not so uh sure let me uh let me go to loki though i do want to see if there's any other last minute stories from loki um not really much in the last minute stories other than um
6288871	6297000	Still more stuff kind of falling out from that whole Visa MasterCard thing where adult games are kind of getting struck on there.
6297020	6307551	Now they're not allowed to make updates to their game post-launch to add Not Safe for Work content to their game.
6308992	6310234	So apparently that's a new thing.
6310254	6312476	They said Valve isn't the problem here.
6312496	6314338	It's still the card processors.
6315972	6318319	Thank you for bubbling that up.
6318339	6320304	I haven't heard on that in a while.
6320324	6322430	And of course, that's still a debate going on for sure.
6322471	6324115	We don't want that to fall off the radar.
6325459	6326181	Yep, still going.
6326723	6329290	Don't let all the other news in the world distract you.
6330215	6332177	We didn't have enough.
6332738	6335662	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
6335862	6338926	We will be back next week in seven days to do it all over again.
6339326	6343432	In the meantime, we hope to see you here live with us at the Voice Geeks Network as we tape our show.
6343932	6352183	And we do appreciate those of you that leave a nice review for our show and help us spread the word on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever it is that you found this show.
6353464	6356408	With that, let's get to some final thoughts.
6356388	6357650	and DarkSakura.
6358150	6363798	You mentioned earlier you're going to do some Palio tonight, but do you have a final thought and wrap up for us?
6365701	6368324	Resist the regime.
6368345	6368685	All right.
6368925	6370407	On that note, we'll see you next time, DarkSakura.
6371509	6373151	Later, taters.
6373171	6373612	All right.
6373692	6375675	We'll go over to you, Loki.
6375695	6377417	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
6377937	6381206	Yeah, I'm excited to see we have Minecraft live this next week.
6381608	6390955	And I'm curious to see what announcements are going to be made other than the date for the new update, which should be like probably next week or two.
6390975	6392419	They're already in pre-release.
6393530	6398178	I guess my final thought would be that we're starting to get into a really exciting game release period.
6398198	6401663	I know this week I'm excited for the Sonic Cross Worlds racing.
6401723	6404909	I'm really excited for Silent Hill F in just a few weeks.
6404929	6409516	It'll be in October, and that means Pokemon Legends, probably the game I've been looking forward to most this year.
6410278	6411459	ZA is going to be out.
6412201	6412501	I don't know.
6412541	6415005	It's hard to say because Metroid Prime 4 I'm really excited about as well.
6415045	6418491	There's just a lot of good shit and gaming coming out in the next few weeks.
6418471	6446993	so although the gaming news has been slow the game releases are huge and we're just weeks away kind of stepping into that zone so it's a nice thing to say a nice thing to see so otherwise I will just say don't be assholes to each other I think that's always a nice final thought don't be assholes to each other be nice that's it have a great week everybody bye you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
6448998	6476642	See you next week.
