00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:35,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

2
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:41,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:56,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live tonight, September the 28th of 2025 with episode number 1063 of our show.

5
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:58,325
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:02,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with you every week with my co-host to talk about video games.

7
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:08,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, DarkSakura.

9
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:10,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're doing well.

10
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:11,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing okay.

11
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been kind of tired all weekend.

12
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:15,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear that.

13
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:20,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I was venting before the show that I was supposed to be in LA originally this weekend.

14
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:25,213
[SPEAKER_06]: But I ended up going to Vegas somewhat unexpectedly for work.

15
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:26,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I only found out about it two weeks ago.

16
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a great time for my work world.

17
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I had nothing to do with games or this program.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would think, oh, Las Vegas, it's going to be fun and games.

19
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:35,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was nice.

20
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:39,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The accommodations and the conference were very nice, but it's a lot.

21
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:41,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And Vegas is very...

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of pricey, right?

23
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,958
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to eat a decent meal there, it's a bit of money.

24
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a good time, but it was tiring.

25
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:52,830
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very tiring because you're at a conference and it's paying attention, networking, all that good stuff.

26
00:01:53,471 --> 00:02:04,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And my God, if I had done LA this weekend, because the Rocky Horror 50th convention was supposed to be in LA this weekend, and I really wanted to go, but sometimes you just have to recognize like...

27
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,279
[SPEAKER_06]: If I overdo it, I'm going to be really hating life.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did not end up going.

29
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:12,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

30
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:23,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I was also going to add to my how am I doing is I have a lot to get done.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a presentation for my boss's boss's boss on Tuesday that I haven't made.

32
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:29,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, making the presentation is going to be easy.

34
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:36,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a lot of background that I've already done.

35
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:37,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done all my research.

36
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to pretty much show what it's going to look like.

37
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:46,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to do repairs on my pig costume before TwitchCon.

38
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:55,990
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am effectively losing 28 hours this week because of Yom Kippur.

39
00:02:56,645 --> 00:03:06,283
[SPEAKER_01]: and I gotta get an oil change on my car and I have a slow leak in one of my tires and yeah,

40
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but I've got to do it.

41
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:19,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear what it rains and pours, but I hope after your week of busyness you get a rainbow, because after every rainstorm comes a rainbow.

42
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope there's a rainbow in your future.

43
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,896
[SPEAKER_01]: If my rainbow comes in the form of a pile of dark chocolate Dubai chocolate, then okay, sure.

44
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.

45
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:31,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I'd known when I was in Vegas, maybe I could have grabbed one.

46
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

47
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get it in town.

48
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:34,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a problem.

49
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:41,805
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you can get it now at the grocery store, at HomeGoods, pretty inexpensively.

50
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:47,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get to Loki, SJ100Matt says, Yeah, I heard it's pricey and also empty in Vegas now.

51
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't find it to be that empty, actually.

52
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:58,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say it was crowded, especially for the middle of the week, but for the middle of the week, I was like, there's a decent amount of people here.

53
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to...

54
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:03,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Loki!

55
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Loki!

56
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:29,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

57
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you wearing a Journey t-shirt like the band?

58
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:33,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I am wearing a Journey t-shirt.

59
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

60
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:34,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

61
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got, this must be the new Sonic Racing Crossworlds playing behind you.

62
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:41,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a game I haven't picked up yet.

63
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,640
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I did?

64
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

65
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:49,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it and it's supposed to arrive today, but they keep pushing back the time.

66
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, it's out for delivery.

67
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just saw an email pop in that says...

68
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, it says delivered.

69
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it said delayed.

70
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:57,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, it's downstairs.

71
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to turn it over to somebody and run downstairs and get it before the porch thief does.

72
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,753
[SPEAKER_06]: So my copy of Sonic is literally sitting downstairs right now.

73
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it said delayed when I looked at my watch.

74
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, here we go.

75
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,821
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they just delivered it.

76
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice.

77
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,424
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 5, Bobby.

78
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,188
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the version I got.

79
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay.

80
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:14,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see.

81
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:15,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what else I want to ask you?

82
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you were, so have you had a screen break today?

83
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you've been streaming all day.

84
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I saw you, I saw you this morning.

85
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:27,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You were doing what you were doing peak or something this morning.

86
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:32,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I saw you were doing like mafia, the traitors, blood on the clock tower, that thing.

87
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked you just before we went live, did you win?

88
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And you said.

89
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:36,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

90
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:37,593
[SPEAKER_06]: You won!

91
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

92
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:38,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats!

93
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were a filthy, dirty, scummy traitor, right?

94
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a filthy, dirty, scummy imp, yes.

95
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:45,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.

96
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you by yourself, or did you have other people that won?

97
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I had minions.

98
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I had minions.

99
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We had minions.

100
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:56,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a wraith and a fearmonger.

101
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the Blood on the Clocktower version, but I am assuming it is just a derivative of Werewolf slash Mafia slash The Traitors.

102
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:04,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's similar.

103
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:05,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

104
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,738
[SPEAKER_06]: What I watched, I did watch a little bit.

105
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:13,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lost because I came in midway, but I was like, well, Loki's still there and there's less seats at the table than were in the preview.

106
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:37,828
[SPEAKER_03]: it is yeah it well yeah the preview the preview it starts off i think you can have like a max of like 15 or so people in there and then as it when we close the game then it obviously all the seats go away but yeah it's it is uh you see you weren't able to follow a lot of it i wasn't able to follow a lot of it either so i was relying on the people that have played that were playing with me to like

107
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hey, what we got to do?

108
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:45,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like one of them is a lunatic is what their thing is and what their ability.

109
00:06:46,078 --> 00:06:47,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that's not nice, Loki.

110
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not nice.

111
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: What the ability means is they think that they're the bad guy, but they're not.

112
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just they're a lunatic.

113
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So like they they will like say, oh, we want you.

114
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to kill this person and then the game master tells me the lunatic wants to kill this person and you can either go with that or you can do something else so like you I for the first couple rounds I played it as you know oh yeah you are the evil one and so we would just kill the person that they want until it became you know there was one person that was starting to you know poke their nose in the places and so we had to take them out

115
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:26,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

116
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:27,205
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

117
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like it's maybe worth going back and watching.

118
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if I spoiled the ending, it still might be worth going back and watching.

119
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Legundo's stream.

120
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't record my perspective from it because it's weird to watch it from my perspective.

121
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,468
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got the whole game board.

122
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of see everybody and stuff.

123
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot easier to do it that way.

124
00:07:48,785 --> 00:08:08,194
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:14,488
[SPEAKER_06]: every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

126
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby is in chat right now, as he sometimes is.

127
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:17,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Bobby.

128
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,261
[SPEAKER_06]: With some comments, and y'all can comment along with the show.

129
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Asking, oh, excuse me, what did you use to play it?

130
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Tabletop Simulator or something else?

131
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because for those who don't know, Blood on the Clock Tower is an actual tabletop game.

132
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:33,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a dedicated app.

133
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's tied in with the company.

134
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is because I registered on the wrong site, registered for the board game site.

135
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went back to the correct app.

136
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:43,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, you already have an account here.

137
00:08:43,949 --> 00:09:11,222
[SPEAKER_03]: um so it's botc.app is the the place you can go and you can host your own games there and stuff like that it's all free um and we're checking out though it's it's kind of fun you can do like public games private games and that type of thing you can there's also like they call them scripts that you can set up your own custom classes and it gets very it's already complicated and gets even more complicated uh if you want it to be but yeah that's where I did it through

138
00:09:11,422 --> 00:09:15,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go ahead and get into some gaming news.

139
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about what went down at the Tokyo Game Show, specifically with Microsoft.

140
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I'll turn it over to you while I run downstairs and get what's waiting for me.

141
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:30,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we had lots of new trailers for things as well as some new looks at things.

142
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:38,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the first trailers that we got was for Gungrave Gore, Blood Heat.

143
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't remember Gungrave too much.

144
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was on the Xbox 360 originally or one version was.

145
00:09:45,577 --> 00:09:59,535
[SPEAKER_03]: um Gun Gray VR was another one I know that came out uh not that long ago but yeah it's it's been a while since we've got that game but it looks really cool um very like you know action-packed and everything um

146
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:03,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much looking forward to playing that whenever it comes out over here at some point.

147
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:14,427
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a first look at another look at 007 First Light, which is the new 007 game by IO Interactive.

148
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:21,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess highlighting Gemma Chan, a new character in the game.

149
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:41,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a trailer for, I think this has been revealed before, Double Dragon Revive Looks like a pretty awesome, kind of like what they did with Streets of Rage recently Where they kind of remade it and everything It looks pretty awesome with the modern graphics and stuff I'm a big fan of Double Dragon, so it would be kind of fun to check that out

150
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:46,955
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out actually on all systems on October 23rd, so right around the corner.

151
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:54,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forgot to mention, First Light is actually going to be out March 27th of next year.

152
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly remake.

153
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's going to be coming out early next year.

154
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:16,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this, which looks very similar to, I don't even know if this is like a mobile game or something like that, but, uh, Animo, it's a, like a, kind of a Pokemon, Digimon looking game.

155
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:20,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, that's something that's going to be coming out.

156
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:20,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

157
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think next year at some point.

158
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Sudden Strike 5.

159
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:32,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a looks like a strategy game, a real time tactic strategy game with an armored train.

160
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:34,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool looking.

161
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:38,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an update for Fallout 76.

162
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about, I guess, like some Japanese player updates.

163
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:45,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know.

164
00:11:45,578 --> 00:11:50,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It says new features added this year, so I don't really know.

165
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and showcasing some of the camps built by Japanese players.

166
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes more sense.

167
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:54,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

168
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:14,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection

169
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:16,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks neat.

170
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,249
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I mean, Hitman's doing all sorts of weird stuff, but now we have Hitman, World of Assassination.

171
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce Lee is your partner against the dragon.

172
00:12:28,938 --> 00:12:29,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

173
00:12:31,462 --> 00:12:32,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why not?

174
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:33,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Bruce Lee's badass.

175
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:34,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Put him in everything, right?

176
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Bruce Lee Roy.

177
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:42,237
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, apparently Bruce Lee's going to be in the game.

178
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:42,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

179
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:42,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

180
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure when.

181
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's coming out September 25th through November 20th.

182
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,942
[SPEAKER_03]: You can play that for free.

183
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

184
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitman always does the limited time shit.

185
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:57,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you can only because like they didn't think they had a they had a James Bond one recently.

186
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:00,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you were actually James Bond, but maybe it was one of the villains.

187
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Casino Royale and it was the.

188
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:03,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because it was Mads.

189
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Mads Mikkelsen.

190
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:29,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Mads Mikkelsen, yeah yeah and but that and that was a limited time thing so I don't I mean I don't understand or I don't say I know everything going on in the Hitman series but I just think that's interesting it's all limited time yeah we got a look at a game called Hotel Barcelona and looks pretty good it's a new game from Swery and Suda51 I mean say no more

191
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:43,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake they showed off some new content for the game that didn't appear in the original called The Ocean Floor and that's coming out October 30th

192
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,477
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks neat.

193
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:46,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhythm Doctor.

194
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out December 6th.

195
00:13:49,483 --> 00:13:51,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a one-button rhythm game.

196
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:52,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks interesting.

197
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very stylish, right?

198
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to go for like a niche sort of style thing.

199
00:13:56,913 --> 00:14:05,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like that they're directly addressing what keeps a lot of people away from modern video games is there's too damn many buttons.

200
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,427
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too damn many buttons.

201
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:11,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So the fact that it's a one-button game, well, you're out of excuses now.

202
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:14,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't have rhythm.

203
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:17,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

204
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:17,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

205
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft Flight Simulator World Update Japan.

206
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,960
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be coming out very soon.

207
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,385
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it looks awesome.

208
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:31,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to check out Flight Sim again.

209
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:37,095
[SPEAKER_06]: 2024 did not hit the same way that the original reboot, which I think was 2020 or 2021, did.

210
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It did not hit the same for me.

211
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:44,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think because they just it was just a little easier to just get in and go in the original.

212
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:45,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

213
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:46,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby confirms this 2020.

214
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:54,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't love that about 2024, but I feel like there were a lot of people saying 2024 was not on the same level as 2020.

215
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:57,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping by now they've kind of fixed some of that.

216
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to check it out.

217
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, I'm almost positive that's one of those games you can play on the cloud.

218
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:30,724
[SPEAKER_06]: so I don't have to download like 200 gigabytes to see I could just do a little test run and see like oh they fixed the problems I was having with it so but this new content sounds neat too of course being able to look at Japan and Super HD and just Flight Simulator I mean the funny thing is I would still recommend the 2021 I would still recommend the 2021 because it's just so damn good like it and everything just looks beautiful in that game so

219
00:15:31,548 --> 00:16:00,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven is finally coming to Xbox this game got remade back in 2024 came out on everything else but now it's finally coming on Xbox well better late than never I guess Star Sand Island a cutesy looking game coming out on February 1st as well as on Playstation and PC and it is a life sim game

220
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:29,652
[SPEAKER_03]: and it looks just like you know your harvest moons and all that what else uh project evil bane um not really sure what this is but it looks neat it's a four player they have a four player co-op missions and giant bosses and all that stuff so they're coming out later half of 2026 uh we got a new look at ninja gaiden 4 uh looks pretty awesome and that's um

221
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:48,265
[SPEAKER_03]: MissFall Hunters

222
00:16:48,852 --> 00:17:13,172
[SPEAKER_03]: uh Winter Winterboro we've seen this one before uh the like mouse survival um game it looks kind of cozy and stuff but uh I guess that's also coming to Xbox on November 12th we've got a Terminal Brigade uh Cross Evangelion so we're gonna be some content involved with that um

223
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what that game is.

224
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:19,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what Evangelion is, but yeah, should be interesting to see.

225
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's based on the newer ones, the movies.

226
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:29,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah yes, it's been remade so many times I don't even know what's different with it.

227
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check it out.

228
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:37,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Age of Mythology, Retold, Heavenly Sphere.

229
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going, I guess, coming to Xbox, PlayStation 5 and PCs just this week, actually.

230
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,144
[SPEAKER_03]: September 30th.

231
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it looks pretty cool.

232
00:17:51,728 --> 00:18:17,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Ops 7 Black Ops 7 Black Ops 7

233
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm thrilled for Forza Horizon 6.

234
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:24,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the reasons to be in Microsoft's infrastructure.

235
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it is interesting.

236
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:34,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it will inevitably come to PlayStation at this point, as many of their other games like Flight Simulator and some of those others have been.

237
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:39,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you could always wait it out, but especially with the prices of Xboxes.

238
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:41,007
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, you know, we got it.

239
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

240
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:47,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, we kind of talked about the big one last week and all the tariffs now that's affecting it.

241
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:58,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think people are – I think it's very smart of Microsoft to be releasing their games on other platforms because at this point people, at least in the States, aren't going to be buying platforms.

242
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:02,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean in Japan, Microsoft has always been an underdog.

243
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:09,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm curious if this moves the needle for them at all, not just Forza but all these sort of –

244
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:12,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta think of a better word than pandering, but let's say marketing.

245
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:22,232
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it could because car culture is pretty popular over there as well, so I can imagine now setting something in your homeland as

246
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:43,208
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

247
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of surprised.

248
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:52,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe because my perception was screwed up because I was out of town, so I didn't get to follow this stuff live.

249
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,337
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was kind of surprised that, well, maybe I shouldn't be.

250
00:19:55,557 --> 00:20:00,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not like Tokyo Game Show is a little show or anything, and that we don't have E3 anymore.

251
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:04,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe I was a little surprised that this is where they chose to announce Forza.

252
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel like it got as much.

253
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:29,057
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

254
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:32,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a big game release last week and this week.

255
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I just bought... By the way, I thought somebody had stolen this from the porch because the email came after Alan left, but he had actually brought it inside.

256
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,884
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't ring the doorbell, so you must have just seen the shadowy figure through the wall.

257
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:50,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But my Sonic Crossworlds racing is here, so yay.

258
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:51,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be playing that later.

259
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a stream tomorrow if I feel up to it.

260
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:55,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

261
00:20:55,852 --> 00:21:24,660
[SPEAKER_06]: there's that, and then I bought Final Fantasy Tactics as well, which is supposed to get here on Tuesday so it's a, and then Silent Hill F, I actually passed on for now, but I'm starting to go shit, maybe I do need to pick that up too, because apparently Silent Hill F is getting a really warm reception some people say it's better than the 2 remake and that I, one of my friends on Blue Sky who loves Silent Hill games said this is the best one since 3 and that's quite high praise for F from the fandom, so

262
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to know what Shane thinks.

263
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:28,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been able to ask him.

264
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:33,313
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on a journey right now.

265
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:35,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to be confused with your shirt.

266
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,219
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in New Zealand right now.

267
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if he had a chance to pick up the game or even play it.

268
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I could text and find out.

269
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:43,608
[SPEAKER_06]: They're five hours behind.

270
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:44,510
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

271
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,752
[SPEAKER_06]: He ignored my text yesterday.

272
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:47,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was a time zone thing.

273
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:49,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll message and see.

274
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

275
00:21:51,607 --> 00:22:15,792
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

276
00:22:15,772 --> 00:22:21,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a little surprised they waited, but I don't think it changes the reception of the game at the end of the day.

277
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:23,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, it's a Forza Horizon game.

278
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:24,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be huge.

279
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:28,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very curious how...

280
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,215
[SPEAKER_06]: or when it releases because they said next year, right?

281
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:33,757
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't say fall.

282
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:34,578
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be spring.

283
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:41,745
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of me was wondering if they aren't going to maybe mix up because there should have been a new Forza this year.

284
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:48,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm using my quotey fingers, but maybe with everything going on, you know, or, you know, just development issues, they delayed it a little bit.

285
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:52,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it comes out in spring and then maybe Fable.

286
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Turn 10 is making Fable.

287
00:22:54,297 --> 00:23:19,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza series is gone oh yeah the mainline Forza games those folks got laid off I'm sorry to say I believe so I don't think we're gonna get another one of those because I think Horizon's been the game that's been getting more attention for years now anyway ever since probably the second game maybe even the first game the Horizon series is kind of the star in that it's like the Yakuza games are all like a dragon now

288
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised, well, yeah, I'm surprised that, like, Gran Turismo hasn't gone that route.

289
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:30,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Gran Turismo is, like, super sim, like, but I'm surprised they haven't tried to.

290
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,793
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good call-out.

291
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:36,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's very scalable, too, but, like, I'm surprised they, they're live service now, so I guess that's

292
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It's own thing, I guess.

293
00:23:55,469 --> 00:24:11,813
[SPEAKER_06]: It were to also go the more arcadey, controlled kind of route, I don't know, for lack of a better term, I think there would be a lot of people would be very upset because there definitely is a crowd that wants the sim games and is probably mourning the loss of Forza because it only leaves Gran Turismo at this point.

294
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:22,829
[SPEAKER_06]: So if Gran Turismo were to also go away or turn into, you know, Gran Turismo Horizon, for lack of a better term, there would be a crowd of people would be really, really sad about that.

295
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:24,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised, though, because I think

296
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:31,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Forza Horizon, like, I know that it skews more arcade-y, but I think you can tune it to be, like, as realistic as you want.

297
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but it's all the, um, assists, right?

298
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:39,559
[SPEAKER_06]: You could, you could turn Forza Horizon into a one-button game, like that rhythm game you were talking about.

299
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:43,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You could just have one button, the accelerator, and I, I don't even think you necessarily need that.

300
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: You can turn all these assists on and off and stuff, so...

301
00:24:47,208 --> 00:25:16,827
[SPEAKER_06]: or there was that other game I don't know if that was still Gran Turismo I was trying to think back when the PlayStation VR 1 came out like they had like some sort of racing game that was yeah I think that was Gran Turismo let me get to a couple other comments from chat here over twitch.tv slash VOG Network SSJ100Matt on Forza Horizon 6 says the developers were saying that the Hot Wheels DLC helped them come up with some concepts for Tokyo's elevated highways for the game that's kind of interesting

302
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:41,295
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah um let's see other comments going back to Silent Hill F um basically more positive reception Quest Buster says two relatively big horror streamers I've watched before really like it uh Bobby Blackwolf says an eternal enigma friend of the network has also who I know plays a lot of Silent Hill and speed runs it has been liking it so I think I call it Haslans playing it too um

303
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Haslan's super into Silent Hill.

304
00:25:43,939 --> 00:25:44,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

305
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:44,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

306
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:49,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Jeff Brutlag, who I follow on social media for a long time.

307
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,890
[SPEAKER_06]: He was also playing and really enjoying it.

308
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm following him too.

309
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

310
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

311
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:55,395
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

312
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:56,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting a Silent Hill?

313
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it, but I've got other expenses right now.

314
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:01,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair.

315
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:29,946
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I said, I was playing Avatar.

317
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:37,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing that on Friday because I want to finish the last DLC.

318
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:41,551
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really beautiful area, the Clouded Spire.

319
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:48,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super enjoying it, but it's definitely requiring a skill bump.

320
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,748
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like new things that you can do with it.

321
00:26:51,728 --> 00:27:16,808
[SPEAKER_01]: so um but but but it's fun it's really fun and I enjoyed the the story a whole lot and I like that it is canon so it it sort of lets it's very immersive I'll put it that way um so other than that of course there's been Dead by Daylight um I got my adepts for V and the Kasu um

322
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:25,083
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm trying for Houndmaster and I was one short because this person just got away at the last minute.

323
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:29,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the dog is stupid.

324
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:49,562
[SPEAKER_01]: and I tried Dracula earlier but I'm not doing too great with either of them I'm getting better, I'm learning them better but I'm afraid it's going to take my MMR dipping eventually for me to get them I played a lot of Pig games and did really great with Pig until I got tired

325
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:59,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, also, uh, I'm playing, uh, the Saturn, uh, Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight or as we got it Symphony of the Night, except we didn't get it.

326
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:12,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, uh, my version is a translation that has the audio from the, uh, PSP version, um, and the dialogue, but you know, whatever, whatever

327
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:29,472
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

328
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:30,814
[SPEAKER_01]: and says, thank you!

329
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:34,099
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, arigato gozaimasu.

330
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's funny.

331
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you playing a little bit of that, actually.

332
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:44,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted to check that out, so I saw one of your shoutouts on Blue Sky and I was like, oh, I want to see that.

333
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:47,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were in the Ice Caverns area, which I don't remember.

334
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been so long since I played the games, I don't even remember.

335
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:50,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Whale Underground.

336
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:51,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

337
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:58,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had completely blanked on how to get my double jump, and then I remembered...

338
00:28:58,763 --> 00:29:18,038
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:19,681
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's coming up.

340
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I play next, I'm going to be going to get the Spike Breaker armor so that I can go talk to Maria and get the silver ring so that I don't go jump down Richter's throat.

341
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I fight Shaft instead and all of that.

342
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:39,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to bother doing the crappy, oh god, Richter's dead ending.

343
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:41,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's stupid.

344
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:44,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have played a little Bellatro.

345
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I played... What the crap else did I play?

346
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:52,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at Minecraft and then closed it.

347
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:57,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that stupid curse launcher keeps opening every damn time.

348
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally got rid of that.

349
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:03,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't uninstall it, I just turned it off of my login items.

350
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:06,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, Curse Forge, yeah.

351
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:08,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steam does the same crap.

352
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:19,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone who is on a Mac, you can go into your system settings and go to your launcher login items and you can disable things there.

353
00:30:19,674 --> 00:30:23,040
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone that is on a PC, you have a...

354
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:34,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's got all of the launchers for everything that loads when your computer does and absolutely removing stuff from there will help you with a faster startup.

355
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:45,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so yeah, and of course, I keep saying Palia, but it's been officially said Palia, which is stupid.

356
00:30:47,074 --> 00:31:00,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been playing Palia, and I have Ormus, and so I've decided that all of my Ormus are being named after my old Taran characters in WoW.

357
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:05,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have Mukau, M-U-U-K-A-U.

358
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I have Moonbeam and I had Moo Moo.

359
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:19,570
[SPEAKER_06]: If you run out of names, you can name one sassy pants for me.

360
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,272
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a dwarf.

361
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also a tauren.

362
00:31:22,075 --> 00:31:23,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I had two sassy pants.

363
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:25,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

364
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping it the moo theme.

365
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

366
00:31:27,545 --> 00:31:31,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of my truffets are named after pork dishes.

367
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,574
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're completely not kosher.

368
00:31:34,996 --> 00:31:36,878
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I have chicharrones.

369
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I have trotters and chorizo.

370
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my peckies, which are all like the chicken things, are pecky something.

371
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like peckysaurus.

372
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:47,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pecking duck.

373
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:48,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pecking order.

374
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:53,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I have what was my favorite?

375
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Pecorino Romano.

376
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm having fun with it.

377
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to get through.

378
00:32:00,277 --> 00:32:03,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's gotten a little bit stale, I'll be honest.

379
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:09,709
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to get money saved up in games so I can get another property because I have ideas.

380
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,854
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's been my creative outlet.

381
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:20,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, just cosplay shit getting together, man.

382
00:32:20,863 --> 00:32:21,283
[SPEAKER_01]: It's...

383
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I need more me.

384
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:29,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I need more me.

385
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

386
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:33,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go to Loki.

387
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,463
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

388
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:54,122
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

389
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:57,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's been like three hours already of streaming.

390
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started off this morning with an event that was through Creators Kingdom, and it's basically, it was a peak tournament for the...

391
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Palisade Children's Relief Fund.

392
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And we raised quite a bit of money.

393
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, I think, $1,600.

394
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, nice.

395
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is pretty awesome.

396
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,171
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

397
00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're going to be doing that now a little bit more often.

398
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:28,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's supposed to be like twice a year or something like that.

399
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:33,084
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you do for a game I've never heard you talk about playing on this program?

400
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played Peak before.

401
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:38,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played Peak like three times.

402
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:39,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to the top?

403
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:41,132
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

404
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:41,372
No.

405
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:45,293
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so I got further than I did before.

406
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:48,177
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some stuff glitch out.

407
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:54,624
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an issue with a vine in the jungle area where you couldn't move on it.

408
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:59,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kept trying to get off of that vine, and then it just drained all my stamina and dropped me.

409
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:08,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had my friend have the same thing happen to him as well on that same vine.

410
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:10,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later on in the kiln,

411
00:34:11,828 --> 00:34:20,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of got split up a bit and so they were like climbing way up this thing and I just I went the wrong way and I slipped and then I fell in the lava.

412
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:28,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But what really kind of sunk us because we had two pretty strong players that were playing.

413
00:34:28,742 --> 00:34:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them accidentally launched themselves with a cannon into the lava and then that was it.

414
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:53,209
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

415
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Telling you guys earlier, I've been trying to get into this Minecraft event space for a while.

416
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:04,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are some people that have different private discords that they do all their events out of.

417
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:13,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you get invited to these discords, they host an event, and they pull their players from those who are in that discord.

418
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:17,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this week, I've been trying to get into all these.

419
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:21,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And this week, I got invited to three of them all at once.

420
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:22,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

421
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

422
00:35:51,678 --> 00:36:20,908
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a social deduction game where you have groups of people who are taking different roles and you're supposed to be talking with each other to figure out and narrow down what roles people have based off of how they behave and also what they tell you they call it the three by three so you have three roles that you could be that you tell people I also ended up being the villain in the game

423
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I had three fake rules that I was telling people that I was.

424
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a lot of, like, fun.

425
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:29,298
[SPEAKER_03]: It can get really complicated and stuff.

426
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:33,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we ended up winning our first game because we took out enough people, I guess.

427
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:37,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because I was able to play off, like, I don't know what I'm doing.

428
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'd be technically true.

429
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:39,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what I was doing.

430
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, like, it helped, like...

431
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:57,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

432
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,569
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it was fun.

433
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:02,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll get to do more of that type of stuff in the near future.

434
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:08,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on the same day, though, like this is a bit much, you know, streaming, you know, now it's gonna be like six hours today.

435
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:12,913
[SPEAKER_06]: So good for you getting out there networking more, though, because I know you've been trying.

436
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know you've been a little frustrated with the kind of

437
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:39,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Networks is a good thing.

438
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:56,573
[SPEAKER_06]: uh okay uh my gaming week it's you know obviously I had a work trip in the middle of the week so and there's no no there's no Vegas gaming stories or that sorry um but I um I did still play Final Fantasy 11 because I'm still on that cat's eye server because my friends are still there too

439
00:37:56,553 --> 00:38:00,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Really having a good time, and we've been doing quests together.

440
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:07,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally unlocked Corsair this weekend, which is my favorite job in XI, and it's also a pain in the ass to get.

441
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot how fucking long that quest is.

442
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,772
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to take a boat, and then you have to take another boat.

443
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:19,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I got Corsair, and I got it leveled up to 30 already, just because the XP rates on the server are disgusting, and with trust and everything, it makes it easy.

444
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm having fun just playing that with friends.

445
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been the bulk of my gaming week.

446
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:40,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo 4

447
00:38:40,327 --> 00:39:00,546
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:03,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to shout out, I've been playing this phone game.

449
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:04,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I've been playing Pokemon Go.

450
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:12,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Pikmin had a big event this weekend that I've been... I mean, there's not as much to it to say like a GoFest, but I've been trying to get my steps in.

451
00:39:13,006 --> 00:39:17,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ingress, I still play here and there.

452
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

453
00:39:42,967 --> 00:40:04,384
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's the real airplanes so it's it's put on by this website like that actually you can look at flight paths online and stuff and you can actually see the live traffic of the planes in your area so they made a game out of it where you actually are capturing the planes that are flying overhead from where you're at right now and all this stuff so I thought I thought that was a really clever idea what what

454
00:40:05,157 --> 00:40:07,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You're capturing planes?

455
00:40:10,646 --> 00:40:12,349
[SPEAKER_06]: With a Polaroid camera.

456
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:15,154
[SPEAKER_06]: You are capturing them on film.

457
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Capturing them on film.

458
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:18,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Capturing on film.

459
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me for leaving out a key detail.

460
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:21,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that.

461
00:40:22,006 --> 00:40:23,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that.

462
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,509
[SPEAKER_06]: God, no.

463
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Capturing on a Polaroid photo is the whole setup.

464
00:40:29,456 --> 00:40:32,119
[SPEAKER_06]: S200Matt says Rob got baited by a shiny.

465
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,502
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife has been baited by the TikTok shot many a time.

466
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

467
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

468
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:36,805
[SPEAKER_06]: My God.

469
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:39,768
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can just for a few seconds here.

470
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the modern day QVC.

471
00:40:42,091 --> 00:40:43,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the modern day QVC.

472
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:49,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk hypothetically like the YouTube algorithm is actually watching this show.

473
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop showing me goddamn ads for shoes.

474
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:55,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want orthopedic old people's shoes.

475
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:59,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop showing literally every fucking ad is for shoes.

476
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:02,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, stop sending me the shoe ads.

477
00:41:03,115 --> 00:41:04,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want those shoes.

478
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:06,619
[SPEAKER_06]: But is the wife looking at shoes?

479
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what happens.

480
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:08,121
No!

481
00:41:08,793 --> 00:41:32,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, somebody else in your house.

482
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm getting the AARP ads, so I'm there with you.

483
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:47,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about this on a previous episode, how it's like, subscribe and play old Atari classics through AARP, and I was like, literally get off my lawn.

484
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:48,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

485
00:41:48,837 --> 00:42:14,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say the one the one that has me figured out that it fucking can't stand it is Instagram because like they've been showing me cute fucking shirts where I'm like god damn that would be a great hosting shirt they show me some cute fucking shit on that app and I'm like ah but I don't I don't give I always make a note of the shop name and I never click on the link I will then like google it on my main computer and do it that way and that's probably why I'm getting the ads but still

486
00:42:15,145 --> 00:42:20,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's... Yeah, I could have... Like, I had the other day, like, I was looking at one.

487
00:42:20,343 --> 00:42:23,012
[SPEAKER_03]: They were trying to sell me...

488
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:29,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Office shirts, like from the office, like Threat Level Midnight and Prison Mike, which are funny.

489
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:36,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's the hackers, the hackers movie box art as a shirt.

490
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

491
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:41,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want it, but it's like 30 bucks and I don't want to pay 30 bucks for it.

492
00:42:41,616 --> 00:42:45,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I get the shirts and I get David Lynch inspired things, which I'm completely fine by.

493
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:46,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm completely fine.

494
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:49,327
[SPEAKER_06]: If Instagram has me paid, this is David Lynch, super fan.

495
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:52,932
[SPEAKER_06]: There are far worse things you could call me in this life, so it's fine.

496
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,734
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Paleo Valley Meat Sticks.

497
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never in my life eaten a meat stick.

498
00:42:58,379 --> 00:42:59,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop advertising to me.

499
00:42:59,681 --> 00:43:00,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Like never once.

500
00:43:01,403 --> 00:43:04,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in chat is showing what they're getting ads for now.

501
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:07,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Pod Culture says, Loki could be worse.

502
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit 55 and most of what I'm getting are ads for dick pills.

503
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:13,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, those happen too.

504
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have an ad blocker on my PC.

505
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:16,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just on my phone.

506
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:17,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

507
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:17,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Same.

508
00:43:17,824 --> 00:43:19,206
[SPEAKER_06]: They get me on my phone.

509
00:43:19,186 --> 00:43:20,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one on my phone.

510
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Loony Bard says, try being female.

511
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,884
[SPEAKER_06]: You get all the crash diet, miracle diets, wonder drugs.

512
00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:28,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yum, dehydrated beef organs in capsule form.

513
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I get those too.

514
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:32,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get them.

515
00:43:32,683 --> 00:43:33,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get them.

516
00:43:34,308 --> 00:43:35,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Because...

517
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:41,823
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I have targeted advertising turned off everywhere I go.

518
00:43:42,384 --> 00:43:44,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Safari, which disables a lot of that.

519
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I wish they would bring back to desktop.

520
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish they would bring that back to desktop.

521
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:48,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

522
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:53,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Safari is the superior mobile app.

523
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:53,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

524
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean...

525
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:58,182
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.apple.com.

526
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:04,474
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I have Adblock Plus on my iPhone.

527
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,657
[SPEAKER_01]: It works just fine.

528
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have it on my iPad.

529
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:12,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I've got it on my Mac.

530
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have another one called Ghostery.

531
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:16,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not go on Instagram.

532
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:17,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not go on Facebook.

533
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:23,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do not get any targeting from there because those are the biggest offenders for selling your data.

534
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:30,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just on Blue Sky and Discord.

535
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,109
[SPEAKER_06]: and the lovely thing is Blue Sky doesn't sell you shit, which is great.

536
00:44:35,894 --> 00:44:40,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Discord, I'm not interested in literally any of the quests that you're trying to push up.

537
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:45,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what it's for, if it's for a movie, a game, whatever, I don't care.

538
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:52,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I, I will say the thing, the other thing I wanted to say to Looney Bard's comment is specifically in the diet front.

539
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:55,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I get all of like, obviously the algorithms figured out I'm diabetic.

540
00:44:55,606 --> 00:44:59,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I get all the fucking Ozempic, Munjaro, all that shit.

541
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:03,139
[SPEAKER_06]: All, every other ad is some thing that my doctor's never going to prescribe me.

542
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:08,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know why I get, or, or I get the, the, I don't know, imported from Mexico ads or whatever they are.

543
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:13,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised I haven't gotten any of those because I've been on Metformin for a month.

544
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:32,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow this spurned from a conversation about Sky Cards...

545
00:45:33,629 --> 00:45:35,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, because it was a TikTok ad that got me.

546
00:45:36,115 --> 00:45:39,544
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, you take pictures, fake pictures of planes.

547
00:45:39,845 --> 00:45:42,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's apparently a whole card game you actually play with it.

548
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:44,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just like capturing...

549
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:47,802
[SPEAKER_06]: with film, the planes.

550
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:48,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's really fun.

551
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:50,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even play the card game that's in it.

552
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:55,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm like, I don't even know if Misty OLR is still out there listening, but I'm like Misty OLR playing Ingress.

553
00:45:56,014 --> 00:45:57,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty OLR playing Ingress.

554
00:45:57,356 --> 00:46:00,000
[SPEAKER_06]: She doesn't bother to like link field.

555
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,604
[SPEAKER_06]: She just gets keys from places she likes.

556
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:04,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, honestly, I get it.

557
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:06,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's a completely valid thing to do.

558
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,773
[SPEAKER_06]: A virtual, a virtual souvenir collection.

559
00:46:08,953 --> 00:46:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

560
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:12,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just collecting the banners and stuff like that.

561
00:46:12,863 --> 00:46:28,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a lot of people that do that too, but Misty just hacks keys from, you know, she's a big train nerd and a complimentary and gets all the keys from train stations around the US, which I think, honestly, that's, I think certain games are whatever you make them out to be.

562
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:29,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

563
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:39,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Like sometimes you'll read the person, this person played World of Warcraft to level 70 and only did it the pacifist way where it took them nine months because they never killed a single thing.

564
00:46:39,399 --> 00:46:41,442
[SPEAKER_06]: They only picked herbs to get there.

565
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:44,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, that sounds like a really boring way to do it.

566
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:48,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, if that's what brings you joy, who am I to tell you how to play a game?

567
00:46:49,454 --> 00:46:50,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Like games are fun.

568
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:57,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And if fun to you is different than fun to me, I think the best games have fun interpreted in different ways.

569
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: so, alright perfect example, my son's been playing Skate 4 or Skate, I guess the remake that they're doing and there's a glitch that you can get launched way up into the air, that's all he does he just does that glitch over and over and it gets launched into space I do kind of do that in some of my games where, like in Dead by Daylight there's apparently one hill you can walk up the side of that just makes you float in mid-air

570
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:30,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's literally a hill you can go die on?

571
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:33,614
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you just float there and then you can jump down.

572
00:47:33,794 --> 00:47:35,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Next time I'll be sure to say it's a hill I can float on.

573
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the Space Kaneki thing?

574
00:47:43,094 --> 00:48:00,575
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a certain way, and this is Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, nerds, but he's a killer in the game, and if you aim your little tentacle grab thing at one place, you would hit it and jump into orbit, kind of like old Space Billy.

575
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:06,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I do those on purpose, and I hate when they get patched out.

576
00:48:06,365 --> 00:48:11,931
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt and Rinmari in chat are talking about Foursquare, the old app that you checked into places.

577
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They rebranded the game.

578
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why they did this, but they stripped the game element out and they rebranded it as Swarm.

579
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you actually want to find the game, you got to do it.

580
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:25,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Foursquare part, they were trying to turn into like a Yelp competitor.

581
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:31,933
[SPEAKER_06]: They would like use the things that people were taking pictures and writing things of and try to turn it into like a city recommender in Yelp.

582
00:48:31,913 --> 00:48:32,494
[SPEAKER_06]: competitor.

583
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But it officially has flopped because they actually yanked Foursquare.

584
00:48:37,099 --> 00:48:39,342
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only like two months ago.

585
00:48:39,402 --> 00:48:43,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very recent because I was actually on Swarm again for a little bit.

586
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:47,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Our voiceover guy, Jason, turned me back onto Swarm for a minute.

587
00:48:47,252 --> 00:48:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I've kind of fallen off the wagon again, but I was on it for a minute.

588
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:52,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is now Foursquare Swarm.

589
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is what they call it.

590
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah.

591
00:48:55,522 --> 00:49:00,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't thought of Foursquare in an age when I realized that I do not want people to know where I am.

592
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:08,265
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like somebody bringing up LiveJournal because, oh no, they didn't is still a thing on LiveJournal after all these years.

593
00:49:08,937 --> 00:49:11,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have my LiveJournal account because I have a permanent account.

594
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.

595
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never get rid of it either.

596
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring back LiveJournal.

597
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:29,716
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as, you know, I don't use it regularly, but that LiveJournal is such an important, like talking about capturing things and photographs, LiveJournal is such an important like 10-year time capsule of my life.

598
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:37,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not always proud of it because, God, I read some of the shit I posted on LiveJournal back in the day and I just want to push myself down a flight of stairs.

599
00:49:37,743 --> 00:49:53,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean, we met?

600
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:55,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

601
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:57,576
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

602
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:58,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Remet.

603
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:01,700
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I met Alan on LiveJournal.

604
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

605
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,023
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing the throwback to when we were teens.

606
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, remet Alan on LiveJournal.

607
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:10,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but neither one of us remember the teen thing outside of knowing we were both.

608
00:50:10,948 --> 00:50:19,456
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that don't know, Alan and I both went to the same teen leadership thing out in the woods that was only 50 kids or so in a similar organization.

609
00:50:19,856 --> 00:50:21,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We know we were there the same year.

610
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the same core memories.

611
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:24,220
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not remember meeting.

612
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:51,321
[SPEAKER_06]: but then we re-met on LiveJournal

613
00:50:52,533 --> 00:51:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

614
00:51:17,288 --> 00:51:18,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that.

615
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:19,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want to push myself down the flight of stairs.

616
00:51:19,732 --> 00:51:24,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot live in regret and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I like who I am.

617
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:25,803
[SPEAKER_01]: If I lived in regret.

618
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:29,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

619
00:51:30,412 --> 00:51:31,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky Cards, cute app.

620
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:33,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on with the show.

621
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:39,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That had nothing to do with airplanes and everything to do with nostalgia, but I don't care.

622
00:51:39,336 --> 00:51:39,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

623
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:42,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we are.

624
00:51:42,203 --> 00:51:43,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we roll.

625
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into some more gaming announcements from another company this week.

626
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:49,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we'll go over to you and talk about Sony.

627
00:51:49,688 --> 00:52:04,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, Sony had a State of Play showcase showing off some new game titles as well as announcing stuff coming to their platform from other platforms as we'll talk about here pretty soon.

628
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:08,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting things off, they showed off a trailer for a game called Sorrows.

629
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:14,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fast-paced momentum-driven shooter.

630
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:17,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it looks...

631
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:18,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

632
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:22,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be coming out March 20th on the PlayStation 5.

633
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:29,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had something for Zero Parades for Dead Spies.

634
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:31,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those titles.

635
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that like a visual novel game or something?

636
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it is a follow-up to Disco Elysium.

637
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was originally announced at Gamescom.

638
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:44,957
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, of course, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 as well as PC.

639
00:52:44,937 --> 00:52:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of games coming to PlayStation that were on other platforms, Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2024 coming to PlayStation 5 on December 8th.

640
00:52:54,735 --> 00:52:55,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

641
00:52:56,759 --> 00:53:07,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got, of course, a new trailer for the campaign for Battlefield 6, which we know is coming out probably just in a few weeks here on October 10th.

642
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Deus Ex being remastered for its 25th anniversary.

643
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:17,761
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming to PlayStation 5 as well on February 5th.

644
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:29,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we got a look at the new Halloween game, which is another asymmetrical horror game, kind of like the Friday the 13th Dead by Daylight type of stuff.

645
00:53:29,352 --> 00:53:30,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to last a month.

646
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:34,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of them.

647
00:53:35,022 --> 00:53:37,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's coming out September 8, 2026.

648
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:39,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it should be reminded.

649
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:42,710
[SPEAKER_03]: So how's Killer Clowns from Outer Space doing?

650
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because that was... Killer what?

651
00:53:44,912 --> 00:53:47,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still running, which is more than I can say for most of them.

652
00:53:47,896 --> 00:53:56,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Texas Chainsaw is still running too, but they were supposed to switch to a peer-to-peer matchmaking model, which usually is the sign that it's done.

653
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:58,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they're not going to make any more updates to Texas Chainsaw.

654
00:53:58,687 --> 00:54:00,829
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the peer-to-peer thing was called off.

655
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:04,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan really liked that game and has...

656
00:54:05,178 --> 00:54:09,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I pretty much held on until the bitter end and kind of know what's going on.

657
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:13,774
[SPEAKER_01]: If you remember, DVD matches early on, though, were hosted by the killer.

658
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

659
00:54:18,162 --> 00:54:27,439
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, it was always the survivors were always connected to the killer side and then they put out the public queues.

660
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:34,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be curious to see what new thing does Halloween try to bring to this genre?

661
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:37,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if the answer is nothing, then it's dead in the water.

662
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,833
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be Laurie Strode with an Uzi.

663
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:49,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would love to see what Halloween can do new for the genre, but I'll give it a fair shot if it looks like it's something we haven't seen before.

664
00:54:49,906 --> 00:54:50,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

665
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:58,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got an announcement that Last Epoch is going to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.

666
00:54:58,089 --> 00:54:59,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's been PC exclusive.

667
00:55:00,273 --> 00:55:06,084
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as the first expansion for the game, Orbis, is going to be launching at the same time on console.

668
00:55:06,425 --> 00:55:15,702
[SPEAKER_03]: The Seven Deadly Sins Origins is going to be getting an open world game based off of the anime that's coming out on PlayStation 5 January 28th.

669
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:23,842
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about this last week, I think, for Sonic Racing Crossworlds, that there was going to be Mega Man DLC coming.

670
00:55:24,743 --> 00:55:33,335
[SPEAKER_03]: But we got to look at what that actually looks like, as well as the track itself, which is going to be Dr. Wily's Castle.

671
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:36,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a fan of that.

672
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,128
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be coming, I think, pretty soon, whenever that DLC unlocks.

673
00:55:42,867 --> 00:56:09,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Neo 3 is going to be coming February 6th as well as there's going to be a Dynasty Warriors 3 remaster coming as well as a Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition remaster that's going to be coming March 19th on PlayStation 5 Code Vein 2 got a new trailer and that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 January 30th

674
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:18,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see Final Fantasy Tactics, the Avalanche Chronicles, and that's going to be coming out actually this week.

675
00:56:19,436 --> 00:56:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So look for that PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for that one.

676
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:34,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Let It Die Inferno, which is a sequel to the game by Grasshopper Manufacture, and that is going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 December 3rd.

677
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:38,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a cool looking game, Chronoscript The Endless End.

678
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that title.

679
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:49,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a side-scroller, The Endless End, the side-scrolling action platform game about a man trapped within the pages of a book.

680
00:56:49,816 --> 00:56:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's on PlayStation 5.

681
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:57,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Crimson Desert coming to PlayStation 5 March 19th.

682
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:05,473
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a weird in the middle of everything, a weird announcement for peripheral that I just don't see a lot of people needing.

683
00:57:05,693 --> 00:57:09,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in the market for it, Pulse speakers.

684
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:16,508
[SPEAKER_03]: They are Sony branded speakers that can pivot and they are wireless.

685
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:22,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's compatible with your PlayStation 5, PC, Mac and your PlayStation Portal.

686
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:25,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are available in black or white and coming out next year.

687
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

688
00:57:28,663 --> 00:57:29,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

689
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:32,568
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Plus getting some cool games coming out.

690
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:44,104
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for Last of Us Day and that is going to be that actually came out back on Friday.

691
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:55,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Gran Turismo 7 is getting a Spec 3 update in December and include two new tracks, eight vehicles, and data logging as well as much more.

692
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:06,557
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, although there was no announcement for a new game, God of War 20th Anniversary is getting a DualSense controller that's themed after the game as well.

693
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, I don't know when that's coming out actually, but it has a red streak on it.

694
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they'll find a way to re-release the games.

695
00:58:15,171 --> 00:58:16,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay the premium for that, yeah.

696
00:58:17,014 --> 00:58:22,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, last but not least, we got a good look at Without Leaks.

697
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:27,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a good look at the new Insomniac Marvel Wolverine game.

698
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:28,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks cool.

699
00:58:28,892 --> 00:58:29,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks violent.

700
00:58:30,955 --> 00:58:33,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, definitely going to be good.

701
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:40,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is being, I guess, Logan's going to be voiced by Liam McIntyre.

702
00:58:42,049 --> 00:58:43,451
[SPEAKER_03]: The trailer is awesome.

703
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:45,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's coming out on PlayStation 5.

704
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:48,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I think late next year, but we'll see.

705
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks amazing.

706
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:52,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the game looks pretty good.

707
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed this state of play because it was all happening while I was out of town.

708
00:58:56,683 --> 00:59:00,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, when you're living in a bubble like that, you just kind of miss a lot of what's going on.

709
00:59:00,148 --> 00:59:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: But that did look... Yeah, the Wolverine game looks like it's going to bring more people to PS5.

710
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:06,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

711
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:08,099
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason to think it will be bad.

712
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So, awesome.

713
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, some little nuggets from Sony there in a surprise state of play.

714
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't Insomniac make, like, an Avengers game?

715
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, they're already doing a great job with it.

716
00:59:19,999 --> 00:59:24,085
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of already tried an Avengers game and it didn't... Yeah, but that was with EA.

717
00:59:24,225 --> 00:59:25,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

718
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:27,730
[SPEAKER_03]: EA's gonna fuck it up no matter what.

719
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, you never know, Loki.

720
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:30,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they said no.

721
00:59:31,256 --> 00:59:34,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they said we don't want to do a game so big in scope.

722
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to do something at that level.

723
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:43,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very possible game developers get asked to do things and they say, no, we don't think we can bring this to vision the way people would want.

724
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:47,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember who made the Avengers game, but yeah, it sucked.

725
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,350
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm going to get into this next story.

726
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:55,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So this next story is about at least one of the two companies I follow a lot and I talk a lot about on this show.

727
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:59,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am seeing this headline misrepresented in gaming media.

728
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:11,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to kind of level set and I need to talk about because, and I've said this on the show plenty of times, there is the facts, there's the news, and then there's the truth.

729
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there is what ultimately guides everybody's reactions, which is the perception.

730
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:25,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to show you an example in this story how perception is leading into fact when it is actually verifiable that it is not fact.

731
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,239
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I talking about?

732
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:38,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I am talking about what happened with this, which is a story about the Hideo Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary livestream.

733
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:40,221
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called Beyond the Strand.

734
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:40,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And as

735
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:57,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Stranding John Hanke

736
01:00:57,451 --> 01:01:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: who you might know from Niantic who originally developed Pokemon Go before selling that off to Scopely but is still in the business of Ingress, Scanaverse, and the things that make up Niantic Spatial.

737
01:01:09,788 --> 01:01:12,151
[SPEAKER_06]: John Hank, who by the way was the guy behind Google Maps.

738
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:15,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other big thing he was known for and where Niantic was born in the first place.

739
01:01:16,678 --> 01:01:23,307
[SPEAKER_06]: He came out with Kojima on the stage to announce that there is a collaboration coming.

740
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:51,336
[SPEAKER_06]: and that has led to headlines that look like this and I'm going to show you a headline from a website that normally I go to for news and find it to be pretty reliable for news and that website is Eurogamer and I'm going to show you the other screen right now so look at the headline on this story would you play a Pokemon Go like geospatial Death Stranding game with smart glasses and your phone Hideo Kojima seems to think you will

741
01:01:51,805 --> 01:02:01,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So suddenly, John Hanke coming out on stage leads to, this is going to be a Death Stranding game that's Pokemon Go.

742
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a headline I have seen a lot.

743
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:05,445
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not how I read it.

744
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:15,680
[SPEAKER_06]: You might read into this headline several different ways, but I am also seeing the straight up Death Stranding Pokemon Go game coming.

745
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I am seeing that headline in other places.

746
01:02:18,164 --> 01:02:25,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But this headline is still saying, would you play a game with Hideo Kojima seems to think you will.

747
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:33,345
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we had some live difficulties and we lost the stream for a minute, but we're back and I can continue my thought.

748
01:02:33,725 --> 01:02:38,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see in this that they use the word game, that they're saying that it's a game.

749
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:44,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, as it turns out, Niantic actually did an event at Niantic Park.

750
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:52,330
[SPEAKER_06]: This is coming from a popular Ingress podcast, Ingress Insights, which was actually also broadcast through some of the Ingress channels.

751
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:56,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of this news information, some of the agents on the ground at Niantic Park were

752
01:02:56,656 --> 01:03:17,702
[SPEAKER_06]: The New Cooperation is Not a Game

753
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:45,782
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's not Ingress specific which remember Niantic Spatial what's left of Niantic has nothing to do with Pokemon Go anymore it has nothing to do with Monster Hunter or Pikmin those are now owned and operated by Scopely that part of the organization split off so to even say Pokemon Go is a little bit because Niantic has nothing to do with Pokemon Go anymore other than the fact that they made it Ingress and Scanaverse are their big apps and Peridot are the big apps that they still run

754
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:49,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So but regardless, they say this is not a game.

755
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:53,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So this information with just a little bit of research you can find.

756
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:58,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But going back to the article, and I want to stress, I usually think this website gets it right.

757
01:03:58,073 --> 01:04:07,682
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a dragging of Eurogamer because I saw a lot of headlines that were sloppier than this one saying Hideo Kojima to release Death Stranding Go and the social media takes.

758
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:09,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's going to be Pokemon Go, but Death Stranding.

759
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:13,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, Niantic has literally come out and said it is not a game.

760
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:15,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not that.

761
01:04:15,749 --> 01:04:44,052
[SPEAKER_06]: and but you know as part of this piece you know the author says it all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games so I imagine our job as porters via our phones or smart glasses per the trailer will be to connect things up and that I imagine ends up being the headline this to me this is just reflective and again I'm not trying to drag this one particular website or this author who's probably just doing what they're being asked to do but

762
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:52,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this problem of this headline world that we live in where I imagine or my conclusion is now the headline.

763
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:56,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got to be better than that.

764
01:04:56,373 --> 01:05:04,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand in the age of getting your clicks through social media and all that stuff, your headline has to be catchy.

765
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:09,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't mean you should be jumping to conclusions to get that.

766
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for the record, I happen to think that this Niantic and Kojima collaboration, I think they're so close.

767
01:05:18,496 --> 01:05:29,361
[SPEAKER_06]: What I think it will be, and this is just knowing that it's not a game and just following Niantic as long as I have and having an appreciation of Kojima Games' art.

768
01:05:29,341 --> 01:05:46,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that one thing that Death Stranding did very well very well with the online was that people could build the bridges and do the thumbs up and leave essentially what were notes for other people I think you might get a Death Stranding

769
01:05:46,047 --> 01:06:09,912
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

770
01:06:09,892 --> 01:06:12,496
[SPEAKER_06]: was kind of what Niantic's very first app was.

771
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:13,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't exist anymore.

772
01:06:13,578 --> 01:06:18,026
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called Field Trip way before there even was Ingress, way before there was even Pokemon Go.

773
01:06:18,346 --> 01:06:21,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Field Trip was what that might have looked like 15 years ago.

774
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:34,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with the new technology, now with AR and this branding, I think they could brand that into something that feels a little more exciting and would get people to check it with Hideo Kojima's branding behind it.

775
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:35,595
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there is a scent

776
01:06:35,575 --> 01:07:00,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Stranding Go Death Stranding Go

777
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:28,144
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I think we're over to you.

778
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:35,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so this is a report coming from Reuters, which, you know, I've never had a problem with anything.

779
01:07:35,879 --> 01:07:36,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten from there.

780
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:50,537
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been some talk, and I've heard it going around from other people saying it too, is that there is talks with EA to go private.

781
01:07:50,517 --> 01:07:53,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, this is a pretty big thing.

782
01:07:55,161 --> 01:08:00,507
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in well-advanced talks to go private for roughly $50 billion.

783
01:08:01,528 --> 01:08:03,029
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group of investors.

784
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:19,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Among them are Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, and Jared Kushner's affinity partners are working to make a deal out with EA.

785
01:08:20,858 --> 01:08:37,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a lot more consolidation like we've been seeing with Big Company A buying Big Company B and creating a big pancake of games and then closing the studio, closing that studio.

786
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:41,112
[SPEAKER_01]: It's...

787
01:08:43,538 --> 01:09:05,893
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much just going on financially, but one of an analyst was quoted saying the EA made sense as an acquisition target, that the cash flows are fairly consistent and EA's annualized titles make for predictable revenue profitability, meaning the sports games.

788
01:09:08,197 --> 01:09:11,402
[SPEAKER_01]: There's... I don't...

789
01:09:12,007 --> 01:09:23,282
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other thing is that Affinity Partners I mean well we know who Kushner is and we know his association and I

790
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:44,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, there's just a lot of things I don't feel good about with this I certainly don't, I feel about as good on this as I feel about the TikTok sale which is also a very not good thing I'm also concerned with how many cookie jars in the gaming industry Saudi Arabia has their hands in right now

791
01:09:44,204 --> 01:10:08,727
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot.

792
01:10:08,825 --> 01:10:18,895
[SPEAKER_06]: They want power in some way in EA, FC, and their soccer game, which is... That is the biggest game in the world, if I'm not mistaken, right?

793
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:20,417
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a bit more behind it.

794
01:10:20,537 --> 01:10:30,507
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this strategy they're calling Vision 2030, where they're trying to diversify their economy outside of the oil industry.

795
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:36,553
[SPEAKER_01]: And further from that, they have their...

796
01:10:38,018 --> 01:10:41,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Their whole group there has a gaming arm called Savvy Games Group.

797
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:51,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are trying to increase their influence over what is arguably the largest entertainment industry right now.

798
01:10:52,835 --> 01:11:06,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

799
01:11:06,644 --> 01:11:13,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very concerned about all these places that...

800
01:11:13,017 --> 01:11:14,219
[SPEAKER_06]: They're showing up.

801
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:21,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, you would think there'd be a limit to that, but that's not how the world works or the way our capitalist government works.

802
01:11:22,215 --> 01:11:24,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what to feel.

803
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:28,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think EA was probably in a little bit of trouble.

804
01:11:28,328 --> 01:11:32,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as we've seen from some of their non-sports related titles.

805
01:11:32,035 --> 01:11:47,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they've made a lot of mistakes in the industry that a lot of the big gaming companies have made, thinking that they can sell a bunch of crap and people will pre-order it or bust out the game up the ass with microtransactions and those sorts of things.

806
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:55,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they have been making a lot of mistakes that other AAA publishers, not all of them, but other ones have been making, and now I think they're in a precarious position.

807
01:11:57,339 --> 01:11:59,922
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I think, a lot more to it, though.

808
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:00,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.

809
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:01,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

810
01:12:01,432 --> 01:12:09,062
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing, and this is actually coming from a games professor at NYU Stern School of Business.

811
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:10,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just read the quote directly.

812
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:15,851
[SPEAKER_01]: For Saudi Arabia's PIF, the deal would cement games as cultural infrastructure.

813
01:12:16,592 --> 01:12:20,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Assets as critical to global influence as sports or film.

814
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:24,619
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another aspect of it we need to be considering.

815
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:30,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to read some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

816
01:12:32,354 --> 01:12:37,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell points out EA shareholders could love this, and that's an important thing to remember.

817
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:57,308
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

818
01:12:57,288 --> 01:13:20,832
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

819
01:13:20,812 --> 01:13:37,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster also with some really good comments here in chat saying,

820
01:13:37,906 --> 01:13:47,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Saudis are heavily promoting themselves in the esports space and in other places like the most recent boxing match between Canelo and Crawford.

821
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, Tencent continues to slowly build up their own stakes in studios outside of China.

822
01:13:52,643 --> 01:13:53,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

823
01:13:54,443 --> 01:14:05,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And I fear that our current government is going to miss the boat completely on all of this growing and all these things just because they're fighting.

824
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to get into it.

825
01:14:06,662 --> 01:14:07,364
[SPEAKER_06]: You all know how I feel.

826
01:14:07,684 --> 01:14:09,908
[SPEAKER_01]: You heard some of the names mentioned in this.

827
01:14:10,128 --> 01:14:13,053
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some involvement.

828
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:13,333
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

829
01:14:14,214 --> 01:14:14,595
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

830
01:14:16,516 --> 01:14:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing's just very annoying.

831
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:29,093
[SPEAKER_06]: But as tends to happen when these companies go ass up and it always sucks because you hate to hear about the job loss.

832
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:35,722
[SPEAKER_06]: You hate to hear about the people and all these – the shareholders and the people at the top of the food chain get all the money and walk away scot-free.

833
01:14:36,423 --> 01:14:37,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Bobby Kotick and Activision.

834
01:14:38,926 --> 01:14:39,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But –

835
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:51,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually what happens is that then new studios and new independents get formed and new things come out of the ashes that then us gamers tend to eat up.

836
01:14:51,381 --> 01:15:09,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it just makes it more important for us to be paying attention to the smaller projects and the things that are coming from smaller studios and startups and things that entire other companies and governments do not have their hands in.

837
01:15:09,158 --> 01:15:09,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

838
01:15:09,892 --> 01:15:17,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I feel that this is something that's been in the works at least since post-Gulf War.

839
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:30,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you think about it, we're coming from, I mean, basically, I'm not going to throw the other acts into it, but we pretty much tore apart their economy.

840
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:39,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, going back to the diversifying outside of oil,

841
01:15:39,693 --> 01:15:56,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a major move away from using oil and those limited natural resources to go into more electric energy and hybrid energy sources.

842
01:15:57,693 --> 01:16:05,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's also a matter of seeing which way the wind is blowing and trying to find a viable industry to

843
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:32,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Games can't be fun.

844
01:16:33,946 --> 01:16:35,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cycle.

845
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:36,797
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes and goes.

846
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:38,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will get better again.

847
01:16:38,503 --> 01:16:39,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Things will get worse again.

848
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:40,330
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just life.

849
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:42,739
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it goes.

850
01:16:42,759 --> 01:16:45,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's always, you know...

851
01:16:46,484 --> 01:16:48,286
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a way to find a silver lining, I think.

852
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:58,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could very well be that this might revitalize EA and bring back old titles or something that's good for the gamers too.

853
01:16:58,537 --> 01:17:00,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can think about it in that way.

854
01:17:02,422 --> 01:17:06,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be an influx of money that they might put into hiring more people.

855
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:09,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm trying to think of some way things could be positive.

856
01:17:10,691 --> 01:17:13,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

857
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:15,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to think of...

858
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:20,160
[SPEAKER_01]: where it could go in a positive direction.

859
01:17:20,281 --> 01:17:21,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sort of throwing that out there.

860
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:23,023
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

861
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:29,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of the cycle of things come and things go, let's go to our next story about things going.

862
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:32,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So long, King Bowser.

863
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:38,939
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but yes, Doug Bowser is retiring from Nintendo after being there for five years.

864
01:17:38,959 --> 01:17:40,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been five years.

865
01:17:41,382 --> 01:17:41,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

866
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:41,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

867
01:17:41,952 --> 01:18:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Satoru Shibata Satoru Shibata Satoru Shibata

868
01:18:10,049 --> 01:18:14,213
[SPEAKER_03]: and he'll be joining as the CEO I think there's two roles though, right?

869
01:18:14,414 --> 01:18:36,377
[SPEAKER_03]: so there's now the CEO and then there's also Devin Pritchard is going to be the executive to succeed Doug Bowser as well who becomes the first woman to lead Nintendo of America yep that's awesome

870
01:18:36,863 --> 01:18:41,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, it's it's just an executive change.

871
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:50,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it really changes a lot about although, you know, you kind of look back and you go, damn, Reggie Fils-Aimé had so much personality and brought so much to that role.

872
01:18:50,317 --> 01:18:50,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

873
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:57,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And Doug Bowser brought, as Ranmari says in chat, the quote, respecting the value of $80 games tagline to us.

874
01:18:57,225 --> 01:19:00,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, so you're kind of kind of hoping like that.

875
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:08,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a weird question to ask because I understand it's a great thing to see a woman in that role.

876
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:13,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would be asking this question no matter if it was a woman, man, non-binary, whoever in that role.

877
01:19:13,466 --> 01:19:14,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But are they fun?

878
01:19:15,148 --> 01:19:16,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Reggie Fils-Aimé was fun.

879
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:19,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would like to see a little bit of fun come back to that role.

880
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize it's not supposed to be a fun role.

881
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:23,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Running a company isn't always a fun business.

882
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,883
[SPEAKER_06]: But Reggie Fils-Aimé brought a lot of fun to that role.

883
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:26,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So

884
01:19:26,003 --> 01:19:48,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but we will never again have an Iwata.

885
01:19:49,814 --> 01:19:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't that the truth?

886
01:19:51,657 --> 01:19:52,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't that the truth?

887
01:19:53,058 --> 01:20:01,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, speaking of things that Nintendo is not a fan of, let's talk a little bit about what's going on in PAL World right now.

888
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:08,079
[SPEAKER_06]: PAL World, and of course this linked to a different story.

889
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Things happen sometimes.

890
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep scrolling and it's there.

891
01:20:11,824 --> 01:20:12,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

892
01:20:12,405 --> 01:20:13,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

893
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:18,353
[SPEAKER_06]: PAL World is going to be doing a spin-off game

894
01:20:18,822 --> 01:20:22,691
[SPEAKER_06]: called Create Your Own Amazing Farm With Your Favorite Pals.

895
01:20:22,732 --> 01:20:25,037
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what they said on... Palfarm.

896
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:26,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it called Palfarm?

897
01:20:28,045 --> 01:20:31,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Fields, crops, and a slow-paced life in this powerful game.

898
01:20:32,155 --> 01:20:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: What people are noticing is that it's a very similar game to...

899
01:20:35,984 --> 01:20:36,906
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they call that?

900
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:43,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Poketopia or whatever that game was called that they just did that looked like Dragon Quest Builders.

901
01:20:43,742 --> 01:20:47,050
[SPEAKER_06]: They had just announced that like two weeks ago and now Palworld's saying, guess what?

902
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:48,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do that too.

903
01:20:49,356 --> 01:20:52,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, obviously they are not aware.

904
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:54,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're not aware that

905
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no way that they're like, oh, we're going to copy them.

906
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:58,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

907
01:20:58,607 --> 01:21:00,531
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they already did everything.

908
01:21:00,551 --> 01:21:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they already copied the Animal Crossing.

909
01:21:02,594 --> 01:21:10,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and I think it's also about that, like, you know, DarkSakura points out, you know, other games in that space.

910
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:12,672
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a very popular genre.

911
01:21:13,093 --> 01:21:15,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so there's a lot of properties that want to get into that space.

912
01:21:15,858 --> 01:21:19,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and Fifth Dream says they've claimed they've been working on it for a year.

913
01:21:19,284 --> 01:21:20,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe them.

914
01:21:20,045 --> 01:21:36,923
[SPEAKER_06]: and I believe them too when all that fucking money rolled in when Palworld first launched which was a little over a year ago they probably decided they were going to put that money into developing more games and this is one of them so I believe it they've been working on their mole at Nintendo for a year

915
01:21:37,662 --> 01:21:50,163
[SPEAKER_03]: What I find most interesting about this trailer is at the very end, like, just even after they've already announced the title and all that stuff, it's just like kind of the, oh, let's, hey, let's do one last funny scene.

916
01:21:50,624 --> 01:21:56,314
[SPEAKER_03]: The character throws what looks like a Pokeball to pick up a penguin, you know, bird type thing.

917
01:21:56,354 --> 01:21:58,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, are you just...

918
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:01,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to poke the bear at this point?

919
01:22:01,993 --> 01:22:07,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, somebody over there loves to smoke cigarettes and sit on the front porch and say, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

920
01:22:07,945 --> 01:22:10,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Like somebody is inviting this.

921
01:22:11,271 --> 01:22:14,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm imagining it's like a clone of Joan Rivers.

922
01:22:15,219 --> 01:22:17,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like chain smoking and saying it in her voice.

923
01:22:18,085 --> 01:22:20,730
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna get Nintendo today.

924
01:22:23,579 --> 01:22:26,022
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can we do to piss in their cornflakes?

925
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:29,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I do this shit just to feel something, but I feel alive.

926
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:34,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, not piss in their cornflakes, piss in their natto.

927
01:22:36,094 --> 01:22:37,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

928
01:22:37,295 --> 01:22:38,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Joan Rivers.

929
01:22:39,277 --> 01:22:43,002
[SPEAKER_06]: But will it land Pal World in the Video Game Hall of Fame, DarkSakura?

930
01:22:44,263 --> 01:22:44,403
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

931
01:22:45,825 --> 01:22:46,966
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think it's ever going to be there.

932
01:22:47,186 --> 01:22:47,747
[SPEAKER_06]: What might?

933
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:52,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually have a list of our class of 2025.

934
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:56,157
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the inductees.

935
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:59,880
[SPEAKER_01]: We have for Golden Age Gamer, Tim Collum.

936
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,503
[SPEAKER_01]: 1990s era gamer, Michael Tang.

937
01:23:03,523 --> 01:23:07,287
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s era gamer, Zhang Jiehou.

938
01:23:08,588 --> 01:23:11,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Game developer, Tajiri Satoshi.

939
01:23:12,672 --> 01:23:14,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry leader, Tim Sweeney.

940
01:23:15,314 --> 01:23:17,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Community action, Games Done Quick.

941
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, Games Done Quick!

942
01:23:19,553 --> 01:23:45,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter Day Lifetime Achievement goes to Trip Hawkins Golden Age Game Space Invaders 1990s Game Half-Life 2000s Game The Sims Pinball The Electrical Mechanical Era so like 70s before Humpty Dumpty Digital Pinball goes to Black Knight and Modern Pinball Medieval Madness

943
01:23:47,043 --> 01:23:51,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is the Video Game Hall of Fame that's out in the middle of nowhere, not the one in New York, right?

944
01:23:55,575 --> 01:23:57,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, International Video Game Hall of Fame.

945
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

946
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:05,148
[SPEAKER_06]: The Walter Day reference gave it away, that this is the one that's in the middle of nowhere, Ottumwa, Iowa, or wherever.

947
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:07,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

948
01:24:07,671 --> 01:24:09,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I'll find out.

949
01:24:09,734 --> 01:24:13,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just thought it was cool, the recognition being...

950
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:16,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And having Pinball involved in it, it made me feel happy.

951
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:17,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

952
01:24:17,756 --> 01:24:18,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

953
01:24:18,537 --> 01:24:22,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously multiple sort of video game halls of fame, they exist.

954
01:24:22,201 --> 01:24:23,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've known about this one for a while.

955
01:24:23,723 --> 01:24:32,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, it's always kind of like they're trying to make a place, a tourist destination that is, what, three hours from a major airport.

956
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:37,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, but it definitely, it's kind of one of those things where you go, hmm, I'd love to see what kind of setup they have.

957
01:24:37,637 --> 01:24:38,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be kind of interesting.

958
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:39,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

959
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:58,225
[SPEAKER_06]: so but unfortunately I can't think of literally anything else I would want to do in Iowa besides maybe go to this place I'm trying to verify if that is the one their website is so poorly designed though I'm almost the Walter Day reference is a huge clue that it is so

960
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:01,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby and Chat got it to load and said it is.

961
01:25:06,463 --> 01:25:07,805
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, yeah, good picks.

962
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:10,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is, yes, pinball should be recognized.

963
01:25:10,389 --> 01:25:11,891
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of fun pinball stuff out there.

964
01:25:12,993 --> 01:25:14,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, moving on.

965
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:15,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

966
01:25:16,852 --> 01:25:27,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we kind of alluded to this last week when we were talking about Randy Pitchford losing his mind on social media, but Borderlands is getting some updates.

967
01:25:27,527 --> 01:25:33,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that was requested by a lot of people playing the game was FOV sliders on consoles.

968
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:39,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So those have finally been put out, and now you can actually check that out.

969
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:44,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there are various fixes for hitching, low FPS, and crashes.

970
01:25:44,932 --> 01:25:51,141
[SPEAKER_03]: that were patched into the PlayStation and Xbox versions as well.

971
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:54,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Different stability and performance things.

972
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:59,133
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of those and rebalancing as well.

973
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:00,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good at least.

974
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:07,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, now the bad news is that Borderlands 4 is delayed indefinitely on the Switch.

975
01:26:07,805 --> 01:26:12,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just about to come out on October 3rd and they're like, nah-uh.

976
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:15,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Gee, I wonder what might have changed their minds on that front.

977
01:26:15,959 --> 01:26:17,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be the performance issues.

978
01:26:17,441 --> 01:26:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I can almost guarantee they're taking a second look at that on the Switch 2 of all systems.

979
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:25,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it runs not great on a 5090.

980
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:29,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's not a 5090 in that Switch 2, is there?

981
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:32,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

982
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:34,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

983
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:43,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's probably a good thing because then they can do what they need to do and then maybe people give it a different sort of look by the time it comes out for Switch 2.

984
01:26:43,576 --> 01:26:47,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of similar, in a way, similar to Cyberpunk, right?

985
01:26:47,801 --> 01:26:52,447
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time Cyberpunk finally came out on the Switch 2, it's like, oh, now this is a game worth playing.

986
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:59,316
[SPEAKER_06]: When it first came out, it was even more disastrous, I think, than what we're hearing about Borderlands 4, quite frankly.

987
01:27:00,377 --> 01:27:01,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

988
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:27,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat says, from what I've read, a new Vault Hunter was introduced at Tokyo Game Show by Pitchford, who apparently spent most of the time before announcing it doing magic tricks God, I hate him He's so annoying No one cares about your magic That is just so Arrested Development He just feels like he's out of that show Just like...

989
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, man.

990
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:32,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he, just like, can you quit?

991
01:27:32,055 --> 01:27:38,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, Randy, like, how about you just quit your job as CEO and go be a full-time magician?

992
01:27:38,884 --> 01:27:39,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do that.

993
01:27:39,785 --> 01:27:40,867
[SPEAKER_03]: New release date.

994
01:27:40,887 --> 01:27:41,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we don't have to listen.

995
01:27:42,189 --> 01:27:44,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be happy and we don't have to listen or see you ever again.

996
01:27:44,933 --> 01:27:48,337
[SPEAKER_06]: New release date for Borderlands 4 on Switch 2, Cinco de Cuatro.

997
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, I...

998
01:27:54,785 --> 01:28:13,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like that man uh um interesting uh Bobby Blackwolf uh was I guess fell down a rabbit hole looking at that video game hall of fame Billy Mitchell is a director at that video game hall of fame that actually doesn't surprise me that doesn't fucking surprise me because of his all the more reason for me not to ever visit there

999
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:36,537
[SPEAKER_06]: all of the involvement with the the twin galaxy like that's that's just an extension of twin galaxies all of that anyway uh other comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network Dark Tetsuya confirming can confirm it ran pretty well on the switch too talking about uh cyberpunk so hopefully uh Borderlands 4 if they take the time to fix it up uh will be in a good place as well

1000
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's move on and talk about the ROG Ally and this new Xbox handheld.

1001
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:57,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ROG Xbox Ally, we now know exactly how much it's going to set people back and everybody's saying, oh my God, it's $1,000, $1,000.

1002
01:28:57,357 --> 01:29:07,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes, the ROG Xbox Ally X 24GB RAM 1TB SSD is $999 USD.

1003
01:29:07,752 --> 01:29:09,315
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a different version, though.

1004
01:29:09,355 --> 01:29:17,591
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 16 gigs of RAM, 512 gigabyte SSD that will cost you $599 or $600.

1005
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:21,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, kind of yikes.

1006
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:29,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, I'm sure, you know, our dear leaders, Genius Tariff Program are coming into play with what they're having to charge for some of this.

1007
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:50,823
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like, when we're talking about, like, RAM and, like, SSDs, like, unless there's, like, processor changes as well, there's no way $400 worth of upgrade for an additional 8 gigs of RAM and, you know, I think, was it 5 or 12 gigabytes in SSD?

1008
01:29:50,883 --> 01:29:52,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's, like, $40.

1009
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:54,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And 8 gigs of RAM, like...

1010
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,137
[SPEAKER_03]: probably less than $40.

1011
01:29:57,758 --> 01:29:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way.

1012
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a part of me says just get a fucking PC at that point.

1013
01:30:01,524 --> 01:30:05,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I realize it's not portable, but, you know, anyway.

1014
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:07,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, yeah.

1015
01:30:08,174 --> 01:30:09,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Steam Deck or something.

1016
01:30:10,117 --> 01:30:10,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1017
01:30:10,477 --> 01:30:12,821
[SPEAKER_06]: A Steam Deck is about, what, three?

1018
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's under $350 at this point.

1019
01:30:14,483 --> 01:30:15,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They just dropped the price.

1020
01:30:15,585 --> 01:30:19,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, with a 256 gigabyte LCD model that says it's on sale now for $319.20.

1021
01:30:21,233 --> 01:30:21,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Oof.

1022
01:30:24,263 --> 01:30:27,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck to the ROG allies.

1023
01:30:28,528 --> 01:30:30,691
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, this is just poorly timed.

1024
01:30:30,911 --> 01:30:42,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, if I were ROG, if I were Microsoft, I would fucking delay this until the midterms, which God help us all, hopefully start to fix some of these problems with tariffs.

1025
01:30:42,946 --> 01:30:46,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, Congress could fix the tariff problem tomorrow.

1026
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that they're not going to.

1027
01:30:48,192 --> 01:31:15,415
[SPEAKER_06]: um so if they are not going to do what we need them to do then we have to put new people in there but we won't get that opportunity for which hopefully we're all going to get that opportunity some days I start to wonder but you know if we are still America we should have that opportunity in a year um so we'll we'll see what happens with that I just think at this point like if you're going to spend a thousand dollars on a first off like a portable Xbox console like

1028
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1029
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:41,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1030
01:31:42,142 --> 01:31:51,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane when, you know, games didn't all need to be portable unless it was like a Game Boy or a Game Gear or something.

1031
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:52,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's roll the bumper.

1032
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:10,837
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1033
01:32:10,857 --> 01:32:13,482
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1034
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura, neat choice tonight.

1035
01:32:16,528 --> 01:32:17,650
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you pick for us?

1036
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:20,884
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose Princess Crown.

1037
01:32:21,726 --> 01:32:29,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out on the Sega Saturn, developed and published by Atlas in collaboration with Sega, only in Japan.

1038
01:32:29,357 --> 01:32:36,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and later ported to the PSP in 2005.

1039
01:32:36,527 --> 01:32:46,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a 2D side-scrolling perspective, kind of like a... I mean, it is a beat-em-up style fighting system, but it has role-play elements.

1040
01:32:46,081 --> 01:33:10,570
[SPEAKER_01]: and you control the Queen, Gradiel de Valendia and trying to aid people to prevent the resurrection of a demon lord and so you get different character scenarios by completing that quest and then all the story routes lead to the true ending kind of like how Live Alive does.

1041
01:33:11,258 --> 01:33:30,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So the game began development in 1995 at a company that, this doesn't say the company, but former Capcom veteran George Kamitani was the director.

1042
01:33:30,682 --> 01:33:52,762
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when the company went bankrupt they were absorbed into Atlas Osaka Studio and they wanted them to continue the development and they wanted it to be a life simulator game like Princess Maker 2 but it was redesigned into an action roleplay like other titles that were on PlayStation as competition and the game itself actually was a commercial failure.

1043
01:33:52,902 --> 01:33:59,608
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it was very positively reviewed and absolutely

1044
01:33:59,588 --> 01:34:02,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Lotted for its design.

1045
01:34:02,104 --> 01:34:04,519
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is very pretty.

1046
01:34:05,815 --> 01:34:09,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually continued to influence Kamitani's career.

1047
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:20,031
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it led him to found me a company, Vanillaware, and developed the spiritual successor, Odin Sphere.

1048
01:34:20,772 --> 01:34:29,882
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to do a Dreamcast sequel, but it was cancelled, so it was revived by Vanillaware as Dragon's Crown.

1049
01:34:30,115 --> 01:34:40,006
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like I said, it's a 2D side-scrolling action role-play game where you control four different characters in multiple scenarios.

1050
01:34:40,947 --> 01:34:47,094
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to use these paths that connect towns and dungeons and then explore around and purchase items and stuff like that.

1051
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:53,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Your combat is a beat-em-up system, and it's triggered by random encounters.

1052
01:34:53,261 --> 01:34:54,402
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1053
01:34:54,382 --> 01:34:59,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get too much more into there, but I can tell you that there is an English translation out there now.

1054
01:34:59,228 --> 01:35:01,510
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several levels of translation that's out there.

1055
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:18,871
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, like I said, it was created by George Kamitani, who worked at Capcom doing Saturday Night Slam Masters and Dungeons & Dragons Tower of Doom before he became a freelancer.

1056
01:35:20,252 --> 01:35:23,376
[SPEAKER_01]: This company that he had

1057
01:35:24,048 --> 01:35:28,460
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually founded it with a friend and they were based in Osaka.

1058
01:35:29,643 --> 01:35:33,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they were going to do adult video games and then branched out.

1059
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:35,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that didn't last.

1060
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:38,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1061
01:35:40,518 --> 01:35:51,451
[SPEAKER_01]: When they pitched it to Sega, they asked if it was going to be a lengthy role-playing game and they wanted to keep doing those to compete with Sony.

1062
01:35:52,071 --> 01:35:54,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he just said, yeah, it's a role-play game.

1063
01:35:54,334 --> 01:35:56,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he redid his designs to make it fit.

1064
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:10,052
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was in the middle of when Sega was dealing with a possible merger with Bandai and

1065
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:18,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, because of another contact he had at Sega, Kamitani pitched it to Atlas, and Atlas was like, yeah, let's do this.

1066
01:36:18,503 --> 01:36:30,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the music, it was done by the in-house Atlas sound team with some additional work by Metal Slug composer Toshikazu Tanaka.

1067
01:36:32,962 --> 01:36:35,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's beautiful music in the game.

1068
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:36,327
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great.

1069
01:36:36,527 --> 01:36:39,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But they said the production was absolute chaos.

1070
01:36:39,751 --> 01:36:44,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It was under a working title of Book of Sorcery.

1071
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:52,899
[SPEAKER_01]: They intended to call it Purikura, but because of Princess Crown, you know, Purinsesu Crown, you know.

1072
01:36:53,620 --> 01:37:01,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, though, it would be too mixed up with Purikura, which is photo booths, picture club, right?

1073
01:37:03,371 --> 01:37:05,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1074
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:15,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as far as the art design was influenced by the illustrations of John Tenniel, who did a lot of illustration for Alice in Wonderland.

1075
01:37:16,216 --> 01:37:32,588
[SPEAKER_01]: the game has of course been ported to PSP and that was managed by Hiroki Toyama who is an Atlas staff member who went on to work on Tokyo Monoharashi Karasunomori Gakuen Kitan and

1076
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:44,078
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically had to go through and debug the game completely and get it to function on the PSP which took some doing but they got it going.

1077
01:37:44,759 --> 01:37:55,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a port of the PSP version went to PS4 and it was released as a pre-order bonus and paid DLC for 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.

1078
01:37:57,090 --> 01:38:01,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also...

1079
01:38:01,154 --> 01:38:04,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Buyers got the digital art book.

1080
01:38:05,073 --> 01:38:10,438
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no international version of Princess Crown.

1081
01:38:10,604 --> 01:38:20,019
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can let you know, like I said earlier, a translation is fully complete and out there.

1082
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,222
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to know how to find it.

1083
01:38:24,546 --> 01:38:34,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why the game failed was actually because of... This was the end of the Saturn's life when this came out.

1084
01:38:34,381 --> 01:38:37,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They were already dealing with financial losses.

1085
01:38:39,209 --> 01:38:42,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming back from the bankruptcy as well, the Saturn version is pretty rare.

1086
01:38:44,357 --> 01:38:48,463
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP version sold 22,000 units in 2005.

1087
01:38:51,849 --> 01:38:55,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But it got lots of really good reviews.

1088
01:38:57,337 --> 01:38:59,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40.

1089
01:39:00,503 --> 01:39:02,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Hardcore Gamer, 4 out of 5.

1090
01:39:03,308 --> 01:39:04,330
[SPEAKER_01]: RPG fan, 95%.

1091
01:39:05,792 --> 01:39:12,384
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it got really, really good reviews.

1092
01:39:12,424 --> 01:39:25,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even been ranked amongst other titles like Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII, and LocoRoco as being up there with pretty decent RPGs.

1093
01:39:25,006 --> 01:39:49,208
[SPEAKER_01]: so um as for the legacy of this game um Kamitani's team was actually blacklisted in the game industry so his career suffered for a while but um the other thing that went down was that Atlas Kansai which is Osaka um dissolved and several of their staff members went on to found Noise Factory um

1094
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why Vanillaware was founded.

1095
01:39:53,781 --> 01:39:58,116
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also with former Atlas staff members, and that's when Odin Sphere came out.

1096
01:39:58,136 --> 01:39:59,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a success.

1097
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:01,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was sort of like the big comeback.

1098
01:40:01,974 --> 01:40:08,743
[SPEAKER_01]: And their next game was Muramasa the Demon Blade, which was a spiritual successor to Princess Crown as well.

1099
01:40:09,704 --> 01:40:22,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And then an actual sequel, like I said, it was canceled for Dreamcast, but then they went on to create Dragon's Crown as the redesigned version.

1100
01:40:22,702 --> 01:40:23,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.

1101
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:25,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Princess Crown.

1102
01:40:25,145 --> 01:40:26,046
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1103
01:40:26,718 --> 01:40:34,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Little trip down memory lane or certainly some of those, you know, whether it's the PSP version or Dragon Crown or how people kind of got it into this later.

1104
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:37,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cool trip down memory lane.

1105
01:40:38,252 --> 01:40:40,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic game of the week.

1106
01:40:40,895 --> 01:40:41,216
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1107
01:40:42,157 --> 01:40:43,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have a little bit more for you.

1108
01:40:43,459 --> 01:40:49,306
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some rapid fire news, some dates and maybe some time for some feedback from y'all.

1109
01:40:49,326 --> 01:40:53,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's get to that rapid fire news first and take on a couple other quick headlines.

1110
01:40:53,751 --> 01:40:54,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1111
01:40:55,152 --> 01:40:57,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Daft Punk are getting back together next year.

1112
01:40:57,297 --> 01:40:57,798
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not.

1113
01:40:57,818 --> 01:40:59,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They are just going to be in Fortnite.

1114
01:40:59,662 --> 01:41:00,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Fake news.

1115
01:41:00,364 --> 01:41:01,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, it's fake news.

1116
01:41:01,366 --> 01:41:01,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes.

1117
01:41:02,929 --> 01:41:10,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be a collaboration event with Daft Punk called the Daft Punk Experience actually started yesterday.

1118
01:41:10,206 --> 01:41:12,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I've been hearing great things about it.

1119
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:13,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me want to reinstall Fortnite.

1120
01:41:14,305 --> 01:41:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are going to have different activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk music, a horde mode featuring zombies, or I'm sorry, robots, and a dance club.

1121
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:27,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they in festival?

1122
01:41:28,362 --> 01:41:29,243
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be in festival.

1123
01:41:29,404 --> 01:41:30,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, I need to check that out.

1124
01:41:30,545 --> 01:41:32,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we in chat confirm, did some of their songs come to festival?

1125
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:36,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reinstalling them, if that's the case.

1126
01:41:37,053 --> 01:41:38,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Lego Daft Punk though.

1127
01:41:38,896 --> 01:41:41,159
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks awesome.

1128
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:46,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a couple of Daft Punk songs that are in my Fortnite collection.

1129
01:41:46,347 --> 01:41:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's cool.

1130
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:49,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll check it out.

1131
01:41:49,352 --> 01:41:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So that looks pretty cool.

1132
01:41:51,135 --> 01:41:58,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another military shooter game that becomes I don't even know what at this point.

1133
01:41:59,267 --> 01:42:00,529
[SPEAKER_03]: PUBG Mobile

1134
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:24,660
[SPEAKER_03]: is there is a I don't know if it was a leak or like an announcement video that was put out um showcasing a bunch of different tie-ins all together um that give you a video of Sonic the Hedgehog um and some other soldiers and whatnot fighting Skivity Toilet so that's what PUBG Mobile has become or is

1135
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:28,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought PUBG was a military shooter game.

1136
01:42:28,471 --> 01:42:32,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I kind of forgot PUBG was even a thing until you brought it up just now.

1137
01:42:32,155 --> 01:42:33,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it is what it is.

1138
01:42:33,978 --> 01:42:35,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Some collaborations.

1139
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments on Daft Punk.

1140
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:41,027
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says they are doing a Daft Punk themed controller for Festival.

1141
01:42:41,087 --> 01:42:42,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

1142
01:42:42,308 --> 01:42:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: SG100Matt says, I played it last night and it's great.

1143
01:42:45,432 --> 01:42:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally worth reinstalling.

1144
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:48,236
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1145
01:42:49,317 --> 01:42:49,838
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1146
01:42:54,155 --> 01:42:55,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to unmute, sorry.

1147
01:42:55,977 --> 01:43:01,224
[SPEAKER_01]: So Konami has announced a game creation project at Tokyo Game Show.

1148
01:43:01,244 --> 01:43:05,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It's YY Worldcraft for PC, iOS, and Android.

1149
01:43:07,752 --> 01:43:14,340
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a crafting game where it's user-generated content.

1150
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:20,847
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use this tool to create a game and have others play it.

1151
01:43:20,867 --> 01:43:26,854
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a world editor to customize the world and make your rules based off of official games.

1152
01:43:27,014 --> 01:43:32,100
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay for parts, you know, little transactions.

1153
01:43:34,202 --> 01:43:39,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And fine-tune the different elements and basically put it up there so...

1154
01:43:39,548 --> 01:43:44,876
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different Konami characters appearing in it as well, just like the old YY World games.

1155
01:43:45,597 --> 01:43:48,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have them as characters or enemies.

1156
01:43:50,064 --> 01:43:52,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And the announcement looks cool.

1157
01:43:55,432 --> 01:43:58,576
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the frogs, which I think is cute.

1158
01:43:58,797 --> 01:44:03,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Contra people, and I see...

1159
01:44:04,068 --> 01:44:07,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see a Belmont somewhere.

1160
01:44:08,937 --> 01:44:10,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see, yeah.

1161
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could be fun.

1162
01:44:12,103 --> 01:44:20,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that the YY World branding is, or universe idea is coming back.

1163
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:34,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of branding and things of the past coming back, very excited that Elvira Scared Stiff Pinball is coming to Pinball FX coming next month, October 16th, 2025.

1164
01:44:34,585 --> 01:44:36,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of Alan's favorite pinball tables of all time.

1165
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:38,573
[SPEAKER_06]: He loves the Elvira ones.

1166
01:44:38,813 --> 01:44:40,116
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in my house for a while.

1167
01:44:40,096 --> 01:44:41,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, because I love Elvira.

1168
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Elvira.

1169
01:44:43,401 --> 01:44:50,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, just in time for Halloween, Elvira is coming to Williams Pinball FX.

1170
01:44:50,713 --> 01:44:59,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're calling it Williams Pinball Scared Stiff for Pinball FX, although I've already called this table Elvira Scared Stiff, so I don't know what they did with the licensing or whatever, but it is Elvira.

1171
01:44:59,047 --> 01:45:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1172
01:45:16,090 --> 01:45:18,413
[SPEAKER_01]: The official game is Scared Stiff.

1173
01:45:18,634 --> 01:45:21,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Elvira's name is not in the branding to begin with.

1174
01:45:21,558 --> 01:45:36,158
[SPEAKER_06]: It features Elvira, but it's just called Scared Stiff.

1175
01:45:36,138 --> 01:45:36,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1176
01:45:36,759 --> 01:45:36,979
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1177
01:45:36,999 --> 01:45:43,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the more you know, there, of course, are the six modes from that little spider that spun around at the top of the machine.

1178
01:45:43,871 --> 01:45:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you know, the classic feel with all the enhancements.

1179
01:45:47,036 --> 01:45:47,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all that good stuff.

1180
01:45:48,218 --> 01:45:54,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I gotta admit, I don't remember the last time I bought a table for Pinball FX, but you have my attention.

1181
01:45:54,308 --> 01:45:57,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Or should I say, I'm scared stiff for this one.

1182
01:45:57,954 --> 01:45:58,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1183
01:45:59,138 --> 01:46:00,240
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1184
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:07,029
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRite is pointing out that the other table was Elvira and the Party Monsters, and maybe that's where my confusion is coming from.

1185
01:46:07,049 --> 01:46:13,578
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's just maybe just you assume that Elvira is going to have the branding at the top, but it is what it is.

1186
01:46:13,879 --> 01:46:14,339
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a name.

1187
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:15,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she in the game?

1188
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:16,763
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I care about.

1189
01:46:17,263 --> 01:46:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1190
01:46:19,326 --> 01:46:21,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether her credit is above the line or below the line, I don't care.

1191
01:46:22,110 --> 01:46:26,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say Elvira's House of Horrors is another one, the more recent one.

1192
01:46:27,197 --> 01:46:27,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1193
01:46:28,282 --> 01:46:33,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's that's the one with the video integration and all that is like the most recent one, right?

1194
01:46:34,613 --> 01:46:35,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

1195
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:40,303
[SPEAKER_01]: But Scared Stiff is the one that did not bear her name in the title.

1196
01:46:40,323 --> 01:46:41,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1197
01:46:42,788 --> 01:46:43,008
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1198
01:46:43,028 --> 01:46:43,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

1199
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:49,900
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to check out some release dates, some things coming a little sooner than an Elvira pinball table this week.

1200
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with the U.S.

1202

[SPEAKER_06]: Except you'll have to unmute yourself for us to hear you, but I know there's at least one big game coming out because I have it on pre-order.

1203
01:47:01,002 --> 01:47:04,670

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1216
01:48:11,799 --> 01:48:16,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the Diablo-esque preview because I went, oh shit, that looks cool because it looks like Diablo with SpongeBob.

1217
01:48:17,246 --> 01:48:19,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, never mind, I corrected myself.

1218
01:48:19,589 --> 01:48:23,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, when you talked about dice though, I thought like Mario Party, but no, it's the Diablo-y thing.

1219
01:48:24,015 --> 01:48:24,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.

01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:31,258
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Digimon Story, Time Stranger on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

1235
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:34,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's it.

1236
01:49:34,121 --> 01:49:35,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see my dates here.

1237
01:49:35,883 --> 01:49:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: No, technically one that's releasing on Sunday, which is weird.

1238
01:49:39,627 --> 01:49:40,569
[SPEAKER_03]: GoSunsoft.

1239
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:43,495
[SPEAKER_03]: A wild last boss appeared.

1240
01:49:43,736 --> 01:49:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Black-winged survivor on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1241
01:49:48,345 --> 01:49:49,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's it.

1242
01:49:49,327 --> 01:49:50,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you mention Final Fantasy Tactics?

1243
01:49:51,933 --> 01:49:52,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1244
01:49:53,796 --> 01:49:57,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it, but that's the one game I already It was like the third game I...

1245
01:49:57,869 --> 01:49:59,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was thinking about SpongeBob.

1246
01:50:00,074 --> 01:50:00,455
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1247
01:50:01,156 --> 01:50:03,021
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, going to Japan, similar story.

1248
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:05,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Tactics, the Evil East Chronicles.

1249
01:50:05,105 --> 01:50:07,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is out in Japan on the Nintendo Switch 2 this week.

1250
01:50:07,671 --> 01:50:15,068
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it's really the only major release on the Switch 2 in Japan this week, but that's probably because the Switch 2 is getting less games than the Switch 1.

1251
01:50:15,048 --> 01:50:20,194
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go over to the PlayStation 5, though, you have quite a few more games that are coming out in Japan.

1252
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:23,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy Tactics, of course, making its way out there as well in Japan.

1253
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ghost Yotei, also out on the PS5 in Japan.

1254
01:50:28,083 --> 01:50:32,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Digimon Story Time Stranger, also getting a Japanese release this week on October 2nd.

1255
01:50:32,968 --> 01:50:35,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That is in a regular, limited, and collector's edition.

1256
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:39,295
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't worry, if you want a collector's edition for Ghost Yotei, they will do that as well.

1257
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,578
[SPEAKER_06]: A game called Happy Route O...

1258
01:50:41,558 --> 01:50:44,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Owo Asete is also out this week.

1261
01:50:55,793 --> 01:50:58,256

[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have at least one.

01:52:57,946 --> 01:53:00,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw one small email come in this week.

1279

[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I will, I do see somebody in the green room, but I do want to, if the email's up, I- Yes, there's an email.

1280
01:53:29,773 --> 01:53:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's do it.

1281
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:36,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, subject is Debbie Delight on the Storm Dork.

1282
01:53:37,666 --> 01:53:39,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello peoples, recently I bought a Steam Deck.

1283
01:53:39,811 --> 01:53:44,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Poking around in the Steam Store's Great on Decks section, I see Dead by Daylight.

1284
01:53:44,864 --> 01:53:47,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what y'all think of Dead by Daylight on Steam Decks.

1285
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, Red Entertainment.

1286
01:53:48,513 --> 01:53:52,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a Steam Deck, so I don't have any opinion, but I wouldn't want to play it on a Steam Deck.

1287
01:53:52,683 --> 01:53:54,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely need keyboard and mouse.

1288
01:53:54,592 --> 01:54:00,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a Steam Deck, and I have played Dead by Daylight a little bit on the Steam Deck, and I will say it's better than a Switch.

1289
01:54:02,021 --> 01:54:11,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't tell you about Switch 2, but I don't think it's as good as playing it on a PC, and actually I feel a little bit similar to DarkSakura.

1290
01:54:11,152 --> 01:54:14,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of need the keyboard and mouse, at least for Killer, I have to have it.

1291
01:54:14,596 --> 01:54:21,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I can kind of do Survivor on controller, but then I think we get into... But if your Steam Deck has a dock...

1292
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always do it that way.

1293
01:54:23,929 --> 01:54:25,271
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you'd have to have a dog.

1294
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:30,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to play controller in a custom match and it was way too sensitive.

1295
01:54:30,118 --> 01:54:31,500
[SPEAKER_01]: The analog was way too sensitive.

1296
01:54:32,101 --> 01:54:35,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I also find when you're just used to one thing, it is really hard to switch.

1297
01:54:35,526 --> 01:54:41,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's true about not just Dead by Daylight, but any game that supports both formats, whether that's an Overwatch, whether it's a Final Fantasy 14.

1298
01:54:42,217 --> 01:54:44,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, it's hard to switch once you get kind of used to it.

1299
01:54:44,841 --> 01:54:48,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I can switch back and forth in Baldur's Gate because half the time my controller doesn't work.

1300
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:52,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a game where I would insist on keyboard mouse for sure.

1301
01:54:52,635 --> 01:54:54,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1302
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:55,560
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1303
01:54:56,381 --> 01:54:56,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

1304
01:54:56,862 --> 01:54:58,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Storm Deck.

1305
01:54:58,163 --> 01:54:59,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, Storm Dork.

1306
01:54:59,284 --> 01:55:00,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that what it was called?

1307
01:55:00,505 --> 01:55:01,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Storm Dork?

1308
01:55:01,066 --> 01:55:02,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that name.

1309
01:55:02,327 --> 01:55:02,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1310
01:55:02,988 --> 01:55:07,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, happy... Oh, here would be my advice to you, actually.

1311
01:55:07,372 --> 01:55:09,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I have serious advice for that listener.

1312
01:55:09,975 --> 01:55:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait for a Steam sale, because that game always goes on sale.

1313
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not pay full price for it.

1314
01:55:16,502 --> 01:55:22,468
[SPEAKER_01]: There will absolutely... I bet... This one's still right now, if I'm correct, because they just released the Karasu.

1315
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:22,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1316
01:55:22,628 --> 01:55:45,700
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah so never buy that game full price always wait for a sale and I was gonna say if nothing else Halloween I mean it sounds like there's one now so great but Halloween I would fully expect a spooky game sale and that's gonna be one of the games that's involved with it so all right well and also don't don't uh don't forget uh I forgot what I was gonna say now um

1317
01:55:48,532 --> 01:55:54,053
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also get killer and survivor bundles, so that can make things more affordable.

1318
01:55:54,404 --> 01:55:58,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I think any of the original ones you're going to have to buy in a bundle.

1319
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:04,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that are dated, not the new new ones, but any dated one from its multi-year history.

1320
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,682
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get to the green room though.

1321
01:56:06,702 --> 01:56:08,705
[SPEAKER_06]: We got somebody in there we haven't heard from for a little bit.

1322
01:56:08,725 --> 01:56:12,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move to the Skype line.

1323
01:56:12,491 --> 01:56:12,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello!

1324
01:56:13,092 --> 01:56:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!

1325
01:56:13,813 --> 01:56:16,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus Christ, I aged myself like 40 years.

1326
01:56:16,857 --> 01:56:18,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio, who's this?

1327
01:56:20,746 --> 01:56:22,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe you said Skype live.

1328
01:56:22,809 --> 01:56:23,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, Jesus Christ.

1329
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:26,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things in my brain just will never go away, Ranma.

1330
01:56:26,775 --> 01:56:27,355
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Ranma?

1331
01:56:27,375 --> 01:56:27,976
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to see you.

1332
01:56:29,078 --> 01:56:30,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good.

1333
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let's just chalk it up as we're getting too old for this shit-itis.

1334
01:56:35,106 --> 01:56:36,689
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we should chalk it up as.

1335
01:56:36,709 --> 01:56:38,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Skype literally doesn't exist anymore.

1336
01:56:38,712 --> 01:56:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, they finally pulled the plug on that and it's all Teams or whatever now.

1337
01:56:42,497 --> 01:56:43,318
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no Skype.

1338
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know where my brain is at.

1339
01:56:46,523 --> 01:56:49,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Some wheels keep on turning.

1340
01:56:50,142 --> 01:56:53,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, Skype still exists.

1341
01:56:54,148 --> 01:56:56,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just teams with a brand new suit.

1342
01:56:56,712 --> 01:56:57,654
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all it is.

1343
01:56:57,674 --> 01:56:58,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that what it is now?

1344
01:56:59,376 --> 01:57:02,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how much I'm supposed to say.

1345
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a big deal.

1346
01:57:02,842 --> 01:57:06,748
[SPEAKER_06]: At work, we use Skype for business, like right up until the bitter end.

1347
01:57:06,988 --> 01:57:11,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And we switched to Teams a certain amount of time ago.

1348
01:57:11,174 --> 01:57:14,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was still using Skype at work long after I used it on this program.

1349
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:16,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1350
01:57:17,429 --> 01:57:18,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand completely.

1351
01:57:18,839 --> 01:57:23,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I miss it, but then there are times I'm like, I'm glad I don't.

1352
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:48,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also looking at your shirt I know folks on the podcast can't see your shirt but you're wearing a it's a black shirt but bright it says I'd rather be excluded for who I include oh I've heard the same before I'd rather be excluded for who I include than be included for who I exclude and it has a variety of hearts on it including I pick out trans rights the American flag rainbow what's the one on the left is that bear I don't know what that one is

1353
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:51,001
[SPEAKER_05]: This one right here.

1354
01:57:51,283 --> 01:57:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's like black light.

1355
01:57:52,429 --> 01:57:54,861
[SPEAKER_06]: No, is that like the black and brown from the...

1356
01:57:55,128 --> 01:57:58,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this kind of goes with the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Black Lives Matter.

1357
01:57:58,813 --> 01:57:59,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, got it.

1358
01:57:59,694 --> 01:57:59,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1359
01:58:00,696 --> 01:58:09,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm wearing this because normally during June, during my podcast, I have four different shirts that represents, and I wear one every week.

1360
01:58:09,728 --> 01:58:09,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1361
01:58:09,948 --> 01:58:20,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But because they changed the work dress code, because I always wear t-shirts and stuff like that, because let's be real, it ain't hard to spot the IT person at your office, so...

1362
01:58:20,322 --> 01:58:22,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh lord.

1363
01:58:22,807 --> 01:58:43,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh lord.

1364
01:58:43,930 --> 01:59:13,566
[SPEAKER_06]: well it's a lot better than the Kirby Netta one I've seen oh Kirby Netta this was my Ingress because since I play for the green team in Ingress I would wear the shirts to Anomalies because we're called frogs because we're the green team so I would wear my Kirby Netta shirt to Anomalies but now I have a shirt with a frog on it and a little knapsack and it says don't know where I'm going but I'm gay and that's my new Ingress playing shirt for Anomalies you know it

1365
01:59:16,195 --> 01:59:18,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have two things I want to talk about.

1366
01:59:18,739 --> 01:59:20,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go about my merry little way.

1367
01:59:21,302 --> 01:59:28,253
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing is, my friends invited me out to a DDR rave Friday night.

1368
01:59:29,274 --> 01:59:31,557
[SPEAKER_06]: You said something about this in Discord.

1369
01:59:31,617 --> 01:59:35,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't spoil the punchline, but tell us about the ditter rave.

1370
01:59:35,888 --> 01:59:56,783
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1371
01:59:56,965 --> 02:00:00,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in my pajamas playing Yakuza 0.

1372
02:00:01,190 --> 02:00:02,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not leaving the house.

1373
02:00:02,893 --> 02:00:04,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And she sends me photos.

1374
02:00:04,274 --> 02:00:05,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at my watch.

1375
02:00:05,296 --> 02:00:08,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'll probably get there by 2 a.m.

1376
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:10,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go get dressed and go.

1377
02:00:11,444 --> 02:00:15,469
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time I get there, there was like six of us just dancing around.

1378
02:00:15,489 --> 02:00:17,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1379
02:00:19,207 --> 02:00:20,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted a video.

1380
02:00:21,289 --> 02:00:28,876
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the characters from DDR that we've seen from first to fifth mix that you can select from and dance with you.

1381
02:00:29,036 --> 02:00:29,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Spanky?

1382
02:00:30,958 --> 02:00:32,179
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Mr. Spanky.

1383
02:00:32,199 --> 02:00:33,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

1384
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR PC always getting shit on.

1385
02:00:35,822 --> 02:00:40,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, Mr. Spanky was up there before I arrived because they had like two, three different DJs.

1386
02:00:40,607 --> 02:00:43,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's little clips of the different characters dancing on the screen.

1387
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:46,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get there and I'm just like...

1388
02:00:47,135 --> 02:00:48,196
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened here?

1389
02:00:48,737 --> 02:00:50,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just give me booze.

1390
02:00:52,162 --> 02:00:54,185
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be me at a DDR tournament at this age.

1391
02:00:54,545 --> 02:00:55,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the booze?

1392
02:00:56,188 --> 02:01:01,796
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends go over and go, no, Matt, my other friend Matt's like, yeah, things are going great except for one thing.

1393
02:01:02,476 --> 02:01:04,119
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

1394
02:01:04,139 --> 02:01:05,621
[SPEAKER_05]: He hasn't played Dynamite Rave.

1395
02:01:05,641 --> 02:01:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I just look at him like this DDR Dynamite Rave and none of the DJs.

1396
02:01:12,691 --> 02:01:14,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And he didn't play Dynamite Rave.

1397
02:01:14,928 --> 02:01:16,811
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, I've even requested it.

1398
02:01:17,272 --> 02:01:18,254
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't played it.

1399
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, who hired these people?

1400
02:01:24,906 --> 02:01:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like going to Chapel Roan Drag Night and not a single bitch does Pink Pony Club.

1401
02:01:29,314 --> 02:01:30,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what the fuck?

1402
02:01:30,336 --> 02:01:33,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, come on.

1403
02:01:33,542 --> 02:01:34,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, Rob.

1404
02:01:34,163 --> 02:01:36,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Not while I'm having my green, my matcha tea, please.

1405
02:01:40,358 --> 02:01:45,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf is probably giving the accurate answer here, going, DJ probably didn't know it was a track.

1406
02:01:45,204 --> 02:01:46,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably was just like, eh, it's a gig.

1407
02:01:46,746 --> 02:01:48,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just play what I want type of thing.

1408
02:01:48,729 --> 02:01:50,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And no idea.

1409
02:01:50,792 --> 02:01:54,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there other, like, DDR erotic?

1410
02:01:54,597 --> 02:01:55,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Jack?

1411
02:01:55,918 --> 02:01:56,820
[SPEAKER_06]: SmileDK?

1412
02:01:57,581 --> 02:01:58,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Kylie?

1413
02:01:59,002 --> 02:01:59,563
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

1414
02:02:00,665 --> 02:02:01,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it hurts!

1415
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:04,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I would sue for false advertising, honestly.

1416
02:02:04,149 --> 02:02:05,150
[SPEAKER_01]: No Olivia Project?

1417
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:06,332
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's...

1418
02:02:06,599 --> 02:02:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1419
02:02:11,929 --> 02:02:18,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take the Trixie, Mattel, RuPaul route because I'm just as bald as those two.

1420
02:02:19,103 --> 02:02:20,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to become a DJ.

1421
02:02:20,686 --> 02:02:26,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to go around to anime conventions and just put my random CD skipper on DDR soundtracks.

1422
02:02:26,537 --> 02:02:27,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be great.

1423
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:28,962
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be better than the music we play now.

1424
02:02:29,836 --> 02:02:31,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I'm going to tell you something.

1425
02:02:31,659 --> 02:02:32,980
[SPEAKER_05]: One, that is a great idea.

1426
02:02:33,281 --> 02:02:35,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And two, there are some people that do that.

1427
02:02:35,624 --> 02:02:41,132
[SPEAKER_05]: They will find an area of the conventions or a hotel that's kind of offline.

1428
02:02:41,152 --> 02:02:43,936
[SPEAKER_05]: They will set up their turntables and start playing music.

1429
02:02:43,976 --> 02:02:47,340
[SPEAKER_05]: And you turn the corner, little mini rave going on right there.

1430
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:49,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll play all that DDR music.

1431
02:02:49,583 --> 02:02:53,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But then precisely at midnight, I will play Carameldansen just to get booed.

1432
02:02:55,592 --> 02:02:57,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, you will not get booed.

1433
02:02:57,715 --> 02:02:59,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe you me.

1434
02:03:00,245 --> 02:03:02,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually, you know, you know what?

1435
02:03:02,188 --> 02:03:02,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say it.

1436
02:03:02,889 --> 02:03:04,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably not supposed to say it, but I'm going to say it.

1437
02:03:04,811 --> 02:03:07,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a tagline for the show if I ever heard one.

1438
02:03:08,396 --> 02:03:23,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I suggested to somebody at DragonCon, because all these tracks have these dance parties, and I suggested that the digital media track ought to have a meme party that is nothing but meme, like cosplay.

1439
02:03:23,237 --> 02:03:27,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's inspired by Captain Spike over at GameBooey.org.

1440
02:03:27,042 --> 02:03:52,071
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1441
02:03:52,051 --> 02:03:55,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play normal shit.

1442
02:03:55,475 --> 02:04:00,240
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play, you know, the... Now slide to the left.

1443
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:00,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Now clap your hands.

1444
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play all that dumb shit and then mix in, you know, all the meme stuff from the internet.

1445
02:04:09,189 --> 02:04:13,273
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the must-go-to party at the con.

1446
02:04:14,875 --> 02:04:16,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's interesting that you say that.

1447
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:22,744
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a convention not too far from me, and Jamie knows a bit, DerpyCon.

1448
02:04:23,505 --> 02:04:23,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1449
02:04:23,765 --> 02:04:32,074
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the video rooms that they have is called the Meme Room, where non-stop meme videos they play all from the A to Con.

1450
02:04:32,094 --> 02:04:32,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Genius.

1451
02:04:33,355 --> 02:04:34,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's open to the .Con ends.

1452
02:04:34,476 --> 02:04:39,822
[SPEAKER_05]: You can walk in and hang out, and that's all they play in that room is nothing but meme videos.

1453
02:04:39,842 --> 02:04:40,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Genius.

1454
02:04:40,262 --> 02:04:44,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many kids walk into that room and go, lol, and then walk right out?

1455
02:04:46,777 --> 02:04:47,178
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot!

1456
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:52,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are some that actually chill out and hang out in there, you know, and just, you know, I'm just like, well, damn, okay, y'all do you.

1457
02:04:53,748 --> 02:04:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, that would be a great panel to do at one of those cons one of these days would be explain memes to an old man.

1458
02:05:00,178 --> 02:05:04,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And the goal is to explain current memes to an old man.

1459
02:05:04,524 --> 02:05:05,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And I nominate Loki.

1460
02:05:05,927 --> 02:05:08,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody has to explain memes to Loki.

1461
02:05:09,237 --> 02:05:09,597
[SPEAKER_03]: to me.

1462
02:05:10,098 --> 02:05:10,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1463
02:05:10,658 --> 02:05:12,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know quite a few memes.

1464
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:12,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're hip.

1465
02:05:12,860 --> 02:05:13,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cool.

1466
02:05:16,644 --> 02:05:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cool.

1467
02:05:20,508 --> 02:05:22,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how about this?

1468
02:05:22,189 --> 02:05:24,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Explain memes to a Gen Xer.

1469
02:05:24,632 --> 02:05:30,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire panel will just be, the Gen Xers just screaming back at the newbies because we're tired.

1470
02:05:30,797 --> 02:05:31,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in my day.

1471
02:05:32,499 --> 02:05:35,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, alright.

1472
02:05:35,862 --> 02:05:36,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but,

1473
02:05:37,132 --> 02:05:42,080
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if you're actually active in communities that still share all the new and old ones?

1474
02:05:42,922 --> 02:05:45,326
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and I watch enough TikTok.

1475
02:05:45,366 --> 02:05:46,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hip to the memes.

1476
02:05:46,387 --> 02:05:51,135
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I think it would still be kind of funny to do a explain memes to old people.

1477
02:05:51,215 --> 02:05:52,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand going on TikTok.

1478
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:58,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only stand looking at my friend's stuff and then just doing the For You page is like full of bullshit.

1479
02:05:59,255 --> 02:06:29,245
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1480
02:06:29,815 --> 02:06:40,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I play Borderlands every morning, every Monday with one of my friends, Kuro Hikari-chan, who fell deep into the lore and she absolutely loves it.

1481
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:43,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will tell you this, Borderlands is a fun game.

1482
02:06:43,745 --> 02:06:44,968
[SPEAKER_05]: It is cracked out.

1483
02:06:46,471 --> 02:06:47,233
[SPEAKER_05]: The...

1484
02:06:47,905 --> 02:06:53,011
[SPEAKER_05]: First four games, no, the first three games deeply tie within each other.

1485
02:06:53,452 --> 02:06:57,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the third game kind of loosely ties in.

1486
02:06:57,116 --> 02:06:58,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the fourth one is the same way.

1487
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:05,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the games tie in through the lore and the fact that each game has a new set of Vault Hunters.

1488
02:07:05,586 --> 02:07:13,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you play the next game, the Vault Hunters from the prior games show up in the game as like NPCs.

1489
02:07:15,597 --> 02:07:18,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember that with 2 and 1.

1490
02:07:18,783 --> 02:07:21,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does Tiny Tina Wonderlands fall into all this?

1491
02:07:21,228 --> 02:07:23,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that always looked the most interesting to me.

1492
02:07:23,553 --> 02:07:31,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands 2 because Tiny Tina talks about a game called Bunkers and Badasses and Wonderlands is an offshoot of that.

1493
02:07:33,451 --> 02:07:39,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to check the game out at some point, but this is the wrong week to get me started because now everything's starting to come out.

1494
02:07:39,238 --> 02:07:43,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got my first of two games I'm getting this week, and then it just goes from there.

1495
02:07:43,823 --> 02:07:47,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll pencil you in for February.

1496
02:07:47,948 --> 02:07:55,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough, because right now we're like, I think we're like 10, 15% into the third game because we're doing another run through.

1497
02:07:56,317 --> 02:07:59,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And once we're done with this, that's when we're going to jump into four.

1498
02:07:59,641 --> 02:08:01,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, well, by the time we get through this.

1499
02:08:01,623 --> 02:08:02,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they fix the issues.

1500
02:08:02,825 --> 02:08:03,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1501
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:08,396
[SPEAKER_05]: January, February, the game will be on sale and I'll be able to pick it up for PC and Xbox.

1502
02:08:08,697 --> 02:08:13,633
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend will have our computer updated by then and then we can just have a free-for-all.

1503
02:08:14,677 --> 02:08:16,399
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what happened with me in Mass Effect.

1504
02:08:16,459 --> 02:08:20,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Mass Effect just enough so that the third game came out like right when I was ready.

1505
02:08:20,984 --> 02:08:28,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually glad I did get to experience the original ending to be able to just compare it to what there is now in that series.

1506
02:08:28,772 --> 02:08:38,563
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Borderlands, with some of the issues they're having, maybe it'll just give enough time to make sure that game is nice and pristine for you by the time you get there.

1507
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:39,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Should have already been that way.

1508
02:08:40,485 --> 02:08:41,646
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1509
02:08:42,217 --> 02:09:02,335
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1510
02:09:02,315 --> 02:09:10,607
[SPEAKER_05]: 2, Tales from the Borderlands, the Borderlands 2 bonus content, Borderlands 3, and then second Tales of the game.

1511
02:09:10,988 --> 02:09:13,972
[SPEAKER_05]: That's if you want to understand the full lore of everything.

1512
02:09:14,292 --> 02:09:16,756
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just want to play to play, have at it.

1513
02:09:17,016 --> 02:09:21,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the third game, you help put together a gay wedding and it's amazing.

1514
02:09:21,443 --> 02:09:23,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now you have my attention.

1515
02:09:25,315 --> 02:09:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Two elderly gay men are getting married and you have to help make sure you get everything together and make sure it happens.

1516
02:09:31,783 --> 02:09:33,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really hell of fun.

1517
02:09:33,185 --> 02:09:37,750
[SPEAKER_06]: What I will point out Ranma left out was nowhere in there did the movie come up.

1518
02:09:38,111 --> 02:09:39,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to talk about her.

1519
02:09:40,934 --> 02:09:42,856
[SPEAKER_06]: The movie is gone.

1520
02:09:43,397 --> 02:09:43,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Gone.

1521
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:45,940
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record.

1522
02:09:46,915 --> 02:10:02,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have, I keep my eye on the movie when it hits a certain price to buy it I know, everyone has said it's bad, it's horrible, I know But for 99 cents there's a lot you'll try Yes, yeah One thing I have learned

1523
02:10:03,368 --> 02:10:09,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang it out with amazing friends and being... There's levels of glutton for punishment that I am.

1524
02:10:10,416 --> 02:10:15,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I get to that point, I kind of talk to old Smokey.

1525
02:10:15,582 --> 02:10:16,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like, you know what?

1526
02:10:16,904 --> 02:10:19,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a little something extra to get through this.

1527
02:10:19,727 --> 02:10:22,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I watch Cocaine Bear, okay?

1528
02:10:23,111 --> 02:10:24,453
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot watch that movie.

1529
02:10:24,713 --> 02:10:26,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some of us.

1530
02:10:26,235 --> 02:10:27,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot watch that movie sober.

1531
02:10:28,438 --> 02:10:29,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot watch that movie ever.

1532
02:10:31,301 --> 02:10:31,401
Yeah.

1533
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ranma, it's always a delight to hear from you.

1534
02:10:36,754 --> 02:10:40,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let you go so we can wrap it up for the night though, but thank you.

1535
02:10:40,539 --> 02:10:48,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights over at Anime Jam Session on Twitch, but you can catch the backlog of episodes over at vognetwork.com.

1536
02:10:48,429 --> 02:10:51,533

1537
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Got that right.

1538
02:10:53,195 --> 02:10:53,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Ranma.

1539
02:10:53,856 --> 02:10:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a delight to hear from you.

1540
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:56,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Right back at you.

1541
02:10:56,759 --> 02:10:59,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all take care and see you in the next video.

1542
02:10:59,383 --> 02:11:00,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1543
02:11:01,013 --> 02:11:03,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a story.

1544
02:11:04,938 --> 02:11:08,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not entirely around video games, but it could affect it.

1545
02:11:08,702 --> 02:11:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: The courts preliminarily approved a 1.5 billion copyright settlement against Anthropic for AI.

1546
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:36,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's a string of these lawsuits that we're going against companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta for their use of copyrighted material to train generative AI.

1547
02:11:37,775 --> 02:11:41,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And this class action lawsuit is going through.

1548
02:11:43,581 --> 02:11:44,021
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1549
02:11:44,802 --> 02:11:48,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that could be very transformative for that industry.

1550
02:11:48,226 --> 02:11:49,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very curious about it.

1551
02:11:50,648 --> 02:11:51,169
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1552
02:11:53,005 --> 02:12:21,223
[SPEAKER_06]: um all right uh with that Loki do you have any last minute stories real quick before we I do not and that's fine because we're running along a little bit with our tech issue earlier so we're gonna wrap it up uh and get out of here for the night thank you so much for checking out our show whether you were here live or you were downloading us thank you so much for checking out Orange Lounge Radio we appreciate you and a nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts Spotify or YouTube wherever you found this show it goes an awful long way to show that you care

1553
02:12:21,203 --> 02:12:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get everybody's final thoughts.

1554
02:12:23,967 --> 02:12:27,212
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I assume you're going to be streaming something tonight.

1555
02:12:27,232 --> 02:12:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know what.

1556
02:12:28,834 --> 02:12:29,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play Palia.

1557
02:12:29,756 --> 02:12:35,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's always what I'm going to do after stream because it's just nice and easy and I don't have to play for very long.

1558
02:12:35,605 --> 02:12:35,745
Okay.

1559
02:12:36,226 --> 02:12:36,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1560
02:12:36,606 --> 02:12:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, enjoy.

1561
02:12:37,728 --> 02:12:41,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any final thoughts?

1562
02:12:41,193 --> 02:12:42,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Resist.

1563
02:12:42,575 --> 02:12:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1564
02:12:42,856 --> 02:12:43,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good stream.

1565
02:12:44,518 --> 02:12:45,099
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

1566
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:45,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1567
02:12:45,219 --> 02:12:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week.

1568
02:12:46,781 --> 02:12:49,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.

1569
02:12:49,773 --> 02:12:53,141
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is hopefully I'll have a new video out soon.

1570
02:12:53,161 --> 02:12:55,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep needing to do that.

1571
02:12:55,727 --> 02:12:58,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I've like refilmed it like four times now.

1572
02:12:58,333 --> 02:13:05,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to put something out and then hopefully my whole thing will be done with the digging pretty soon on that.

1573
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:06,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1574
02:13:07,262 --> 02:13:13,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought is I meant to do like a longer video on it this week and I just never got around to it.

1575
02:13:13,670 --> 02:13:24,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll still put something out this week but I want to wish a happy 50th birthday to the Rocky Horror Picture Show which was celebrated in LA with a big convention this weekend which I was originally going to go to but I didn't.

1576
02:13:25,046 --> 02:13:26,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Just things happen sometimes.

1577
02:13:26,888 --> 02:13:30,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I am sad I missed that but obviously that movie has had a huge impact on my life.

1578
02:13:31,515 --> 02:13:35,440
[SPEAKER_06]: One could argue we would have never gotten around to this particular show

1579
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:55,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't care what anybody says, Tim Curry will always look incredible in fishnets.

1580
02:13:56,803 --> 02:13:58,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great week, everybody.

1581
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,006
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.

1582
02:14:00,407 --> 02:14:00,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.
