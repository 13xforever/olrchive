1
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:12,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Once upon a time, Sonic was exclusively Sega's darling.

2
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:16,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega's exit from the console wars means that more gamers get to enjoy Sonic in their games.

3
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,034
[SPEAKER_07]: That's mostly a good thing.

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And turnabout is fair play.

5
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,639
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll soon be able to race Sonic and others as Mega Man.

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:24,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully.

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:27,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Prepare your rush jets.

9
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:32,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

10
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

12
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:45,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

13
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

14
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back and live once again tonight.

15
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:55,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode number 1062 for September the 21st, 2025.

16
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember the 21st night of September?

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

18
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It's myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host.

19
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

21
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:08,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

22
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:08,850
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

23
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:30,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm okay yeah um you've been doing some streaming this week some fun games playing um I've been playing some different stuff and going back to things but I'll talk about that during my gaming week all right sounds good uh we'll go over and say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki hello hi Loki how are you

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this game you've got playing behind you tonight as we are, of course, taping live as we do every week at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, VOG Network, usually right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except our pal Bobby has the night off.

25
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:52,328
[SPEAKER_06]: He is listening to polka music as he posted about on Blue Sky.

26
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:56,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that's code for Weird Al Yankovic, which, you know, I can understand.

27
00:01:56,772 --> 00:01:59,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird Al's a worthy reason to take a night off.

28
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

29
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was an amazing show.

30
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a tour, right?

31
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:08,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I feel like he's, I wonder if he's seeing the exact same thing because I feel like it's part of a festival out there.

32
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong, but I feel like that was a thing.

33
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:13,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's other bands too, but Weird Al's like the highlight.

34
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:13,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

35
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:42,760
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as I know it was always just Al and Puddles the Clown or Puddles Pity Party that would have been a fun show I don't know why I always miss that stuff I liked that a lot more than I thought I would because I normally hate clowns oh yeah, I didn't think about the sort of conflict there not an amazing voice at least Puddles Pity Party makes clowns bearable

36
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:49,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I like sad, angry clowns better.

37
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even going to ask.

38
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to mess around with it.

39
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:53,452
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

40
00:02:54,194 --> 00:03:00,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say, oh, I was saying with Loki, you have the game playing behind you, and I don't think I recognize it, but is that C-3PO?

41
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a Star Wars game?

42
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:02,069
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

43
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:03,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not a Star Wars game.

44
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:05,997
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is Borderlands 4.

45
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, how do I?

46
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was gonna say, how do I not recognize that?

47
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I'm like, well, I haven't really played the other Borderlands games.

48
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually know that's a lie.

49
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:18,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play quite a bit of Borderlands one, at least.

50
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But like one and two were all like Wild West.

51
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And this looks sci fi Bioshock.

52
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:26,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there like a tone change that happened in the game?

53
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:27,809
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

54
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

55
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm just... There's always sci-fi in Borderlands, wasn't it?

56
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:37,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but like, not looking like you're in a space station or whatever this is that's playing on the game right now.

57
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's just a villain, you know?

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't villain things.

59
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright.

60
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:47,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some gaming news, which I actually, again, I feel like we've really been in this news drought lately.

61
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the heck is going on, what's in the air, but we do have some things to talk about, of course, you know, but it's just kind of odd.

62
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they terrific things?

63
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:01,406
[SPEAKER_06]: No, well, there's a couple stories tonight that are fine.

64
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,030
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're here for.

65
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:04,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

66
00:04:05,473 --> 00:04:07,216
[SPEAKER_05]: We let everyone know what's going on.

67
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:12,906
[SPEAKER_05]: We give you the pulse on the gaming world so you don't have to go look all this stuff by yourself and be depressed about it.

68
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,876
[SPEAKER_06]: The good, the bad, and the ugly.

69
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:19,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think DarkSakura, you have a kickoff topic for us tonight that is kind of bad and ugly.

70
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,004
[SPEAKER_05]: This ain't just ugly, it's fugly.

71
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just when you thought it was safe to spend money again, Microsoft is raising Xbox prices in the US.

72
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:37,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So Series S 512 is going from $380 to $400.

73
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:40,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a $20 increase for some of them.

74
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:42,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The Series X Digital is going up $50.

75
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,371
[SPEAKER_05]: The Series X is going up $150.

76
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

77
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:54,059
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition is going from $730 to $800.

78
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:57,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the second price increase this year.

79
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:58,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.

80
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last time they raised prices was in May.

81
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree, Brad.

82
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:03,434
[SPEAKER_05]: JFC.

83
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Or FFS in my case.

84
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,484
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I mean, it's not just Microsoft doing it.

85
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,647
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just like a more recent trend.

86
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, think about our current economic environment.

87
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:30,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But Sony has raised their prices earlier this year, and we know that the Switch 2 pre-orders were delayed because Nintendo was looking into their options.

88
00:05:31,355 --> 00:06:00,568
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was higher than people expected but now the Switch has a price you know price race too I think that happened what beginning of August end of July and all the accessories too got a hike too I'm glad I got mine free free and it still works but yeah yeah so if you want even the cheapo Xbox

89
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:02,070
[SPEAKER_05]: 400 bones.

90
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:08,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the cheaper way to play Xbox right now is to not fucking bother and do the cloud.

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, honestly, seems like, I mean, well, you know, it depends on your internet, right?

92
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:15,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you're getting charged a lot for bandwidth and that's not going to be a cheap option.

93
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:31,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sure looks more and more like the cloud is such an attractive option because no matter what your PC is powered at, as long as you meet that bare minimum to do cloud gaming, which isn't much, you know, you can access Xbox and stuff on Game Pass, which is probably why Microsoft's leaning more and more into the cloud.

94
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:32,243
Yeah.

95
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:35,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my gigabit ethernet.

96
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:35,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

97
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my Mac Studio that comes with a gigabit jack.

98
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:41,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

99
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm good.

100
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:47,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need no Xbox to make my life happy.

101
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like Microsoft's adding more to the cloud gaming too.

102
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:55,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I just saw a story about things that aren't necessarily in your library you can still stream.

103
00:06:56,437 --> 00:07:06,493
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to purchase it one way or the other, I'm sure, but they're trying to open up more and more of the cloud streaming, which makes sense because the obvious question in the room is who's going to buy a fucking Xbox right now?

104
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is going to buy an Xbox right now?

105
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like

106
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,323
[SPEAKER_04]: People to whom money is no object.

107
00:07:13,984 --> 00:07:16,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say you're a fool if you buy an Xbox right now.

108
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:18,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You are free to spend money how you see fit.

109
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that is the value to you, then go off, sis.

110
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:26,761
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really feel like the Xbox is set up to fail right now.

111
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And I completely understand.

112
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:30,746
[SPEAKER_06]: This is because of the political environment and things going on there.

113
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:34,191
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not like Microsoft's sole decision or something.

114
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:35,693
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry is set up to fail.

115
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:39,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's another way to look at it for sure.

116
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they're trying to solve...

117
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:51,323
[SPEAKER_05]: What they see as a problem with the only way that a corporation knows how, they don't think outside of the box.

118
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The last person to truly think outside of the box was Iwata.

119
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as far as the head of the company.

120
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:06,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I was reading the other day an interview with the head of Larian who was also just like,

121
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,375
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're doing it all wrong.

122
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:10,820
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you do.

123
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:18,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to make sure that your user base is happy and you keep it into something that they want to spend that money on.

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

125
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:28,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at chat, I feel like this just puts a lot in perspective what PodCulture says here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

126
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:37,022
[SPEAKER_06]: PodCulture says, I paid less and I bought mine from a damn scalper in the pandemic, which that's a whole other can of worms.

127
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But whether you agree with PodCulture doing that or not, it sure puts a lot into perspective.

128
00:08:43,173 --> 00:09:09,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, I know.

129
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:10,590
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's wild.

130
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:25,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I just, I just, like, for me, if I'm Phil Spencer and I'm Xbox, which thank God I'm not, but if I'm there, like, I am just at this point starting to really step away from trying to sell hardware and really pushing how software can carry.

131
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:28,154
[SPEAKER_06]: How do, how is the cloud lucrative?

132
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,076
[SPEAKER_06]: How is Xbox Game Pass lucrative?

133
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:34,582
[SPEAKER_06]: How do indie games still run great on Xbox One?

134
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:36,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And that makes a decent solution.

135
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:38,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I, I, and it,

136
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:53,508
[SPEAKER_06]: To Microsoft's credit, they have been leaning into this for a while, certainly more so than their competitors, with the whole every box is an Xbox and that whole thing that they have been doing for several months ahead of anything that happened in the political climate.

137
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:58,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do feel like Microsoft is probably better set up for this kind of crap than anybody.

138
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:06,627
[SPEAKER_06]: but I mean not that Sony seems to be hurting but I would still argue the same thing and say the exact same thing about PlayStation 5 right now.

139
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's a smart time to buy a PlayStation 5 either or a PlayStation 5 Pro.

140
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:18,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize the price of those hasn't gone up as much but you still know there is a literal artificial price increase to those systems.

141
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so weird.

142
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:33,503
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what unchecked power by someone who doesn't know what he's doing happens.

143
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,165
[SPEAKER_06]: No, 100%.

144
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:35,345
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.

145
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,908
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt.

146
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead.

147
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:46,298
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, not to get too political, but I mean, they already made H1B visas, you know, now a subscription model.

148
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:51,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's just the way the world's going, I guess.

149
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:57,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, literally, I don't smoke, but I feel like sitting on the porch and just taking a big drag off a cigarette and just going...

150
00:10:58,038 --> 00:10:58,779
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?

151
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,082
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the horrors we're going to wake up tomorrow?

152
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:02,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Damage report!

153
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:09,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I'm just at this point where nothing... Well, because every day shocks me, nothing shocks me.

154
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here's the latest bit of drama I heard.

155
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I was listening to... It was like some Fox News interview with a constitutional specialist who was like, yeah, um...

156
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:31,192
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no third or fourth term because it's in the Constitution.

157
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, are you sure?

158
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, dude, I'm a constitutional scholar.

159
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:35,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

160
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are always like, oh, well, we'll see.

161
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

162
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:40,754
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

163
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

164
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:43,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I say no?

165
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,439
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

166
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way, because this is really what I'm seeing happening on a wide scale.

167
00:11:50,585 --> 00:12:00,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've said this a lot about gaming, and yes, this does have to do with video games, because this is the exact same thing I've been saying about video game media and the way we perceive things and the way things go on social media.

168
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:03,921
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth doesn't matter.

169
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:06,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, shocking, but that's the facts.

170
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,868
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth doesn't matter.

171
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the perception that guides things at the end of the day.

172
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:13,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

173
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:17,659
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what some people do politically?

174
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:28,153
[SPEAKER_06]: They get on there and they push, they push, they talk, they talk, they lie, they lie, and try to shift people's perceptions because then that becomes the truth.

175
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:33,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has been happening ever since it was Barack Obama wasn't born in the U.S.

176
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,966
[SPEAKER_06]: When like literally there is a birth certificate that says Hawaii.

177
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:41,052
[SPEAKER_06]: It has literally been that since, what was that, 20 years ago at this point?

178
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:43,335
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not that long.

179
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:48,201
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't want Hawaii to be considered part of the United States, then maybe you shouldn't colonized it.

180
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the whole thing.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

182
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and you know, if you're pissed that we're getting political on this whole thing, tough titty.

183
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:02,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is, this Xbox going up, video games getting expensive.

184
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,451
[SPEAKER_06]: There is nothing else to blame for that.

185
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to challenge your perception.

186
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,836
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something we can all do.

187
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, you, everybody.

188
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Challenge your perceptions.

189
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:18,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at what is really driving these price increases.

190
00:13:19,968 --> 00:13:22,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Fact check all the things.

191
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:24,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

192
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:30,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way we escape from the harshness of reality is that we play video games.

193
00:13:30,454 --> 00:13:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing to take our minds off of the horrors of the real world.

194
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,323
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

195
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:43,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually took a break off of Dead by Daylight for the week.

196
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:48,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I did log in a couple of times just to, you know, check stuff.

197
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:50,478
[SPEAKER_05]: But I took the week off.

198
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:55,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had a really awful, gut-wrenching week.

199
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:06,231
[SPEAKER_05]: and um I've had a lot going on at work so I just have been trying to focus on things that make me happy and so um I uh

200
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Palia.

201
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:21,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Avatar Frontiers of Pandora because shooting the silly, terrible human beings in that game make me really happy because people suck.

202
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:27,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it to a vote on my Discord.

203
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,737
[SPEAKER_05]: for what game I should play.

204
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:36,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've played through Dragon Age Inquisition like four times on stream and Mass Effect twice.

205
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Three times, I think.

206
00:14:38,538 --> 00:14:39,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning the whole trilogy.

207
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the whole trilogy.

208
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, okay, so what should I play?

209
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: and everyone wanted to see Symphony of the Night.

210
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, which version?

211
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:54,185
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation one or this put together edited Saturn one?

212
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, the Saturn one.

213
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:57,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay, play the Saturn one.

214
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:04,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like two thirds through the first castle just running around being an idiot.

215
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sad I missed that.

216
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see that version.

217
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Accidentally using Soulsteel the one time I don't want to use it.

218
00:15:11,838 --> 00:15:30,876
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:56,982
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there's this one uh like sword knight guy that's like a pain in the ass to get through but if you can jump past him and then go behind you get a room with stuff but then you punch the wall and kneel down in the wall and after like a minute or so you go down a platform and right there is the jewel knuckle and you get like amazing attack at a really early level

220
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's been so long since I played Symphony of the Night on any platform.

221
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:06,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to experience it on Saturn, but I haven't really played the game forever.

222
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hook you up.

223
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd be cool.

224
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:09,861
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk.

225
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,262
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk.

226
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:11,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

227
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm going to be playing Palia tonight.

228
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:17,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, again, I want to keep some chill vibes.

229
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going back, though, to my...

230
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:28,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to get P100 Pig and my Dracula Adept, which is actually kind of hard.

231
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:30,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest, it's hard.

232
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not looking forward to Hellmaster at all.

233
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've also just been playing a lot of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

234
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:44,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I also found a translation for the Super Famicom Record of Lodoss War RPG.

235
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot that it was semi-tactics based.

236
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:55,861
[SPEAKER_05]: But I played it for a little bit and got all nostalgic for the anime.

237
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually reading the first of the books right now.

238
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:06,938
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who doesn't know, Record of Lodoss War, if I recall correctly, was a tabletop RPG first, based off D&D.

239
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it spun anime and video games and all kinds of stuff.

240
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:17,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played a little bit of that, and...

241
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:21,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to decide if I wanted to do another SNES RPG.

242
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just trying a few different ones and seeing if it hit any kind of joy in my heart.

243
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, not really much of anything.

244
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I might start Marvelous, considering that.

245
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:57,233
[SPEAKER_05]: but I also started playing Minecraft and by started playing I meant I have the game and started downloading mods and I am going to be playing well I played before and then I got bored my account expired so I had to get it again but

246
00:17:57,213 --> 00:18:01,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be doing a bonus stream with Shay.

247
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, her delightful boyfriend Ryan is visiting from Scotland.

248
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:07,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you two.

249
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:13,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I probably won't be able to do that until after TwitchCon.

250
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also did promise to do a stream of playing Marvel Rivals.

251
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:27,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am opening that up to whoever wants to play with me and keep me from not dying.

252
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:55,654
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'll get motion sick I need someone to hold my hair when I throw up maybe it depends on when because I literally have played that game once and it wasn't even against real people it was against bots it's the only way I've played that game I'm thinking about I wanted to wait until Nightcrawler was out in the game because I know it has to happen but I have all this stuff for Invisible Woman I was thinking of either going to Emma or Phoenix I haven't decided

253
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I can figure out a healer.

254
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember who I was playing that I liked for heals but I can figure it out.

255
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Heals please, heals please.

256
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

257
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:05,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Heal, please.

258
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,200
[SPEAKER_06]: As 200 Matt says, Jamie and Loki are playing Minecraft.

259
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for Rob to join in.

260
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

261
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have Minecraft and I've played it before.

262
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I don't get sucked in the way Matt does.

263
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I kind of go, oh, for my crafting joy, I'm going to play No Man's Sky.

264
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know.

265
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:25,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I sometimes feel a little bit stuck on what to do in Minecraft.

266
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:26,203
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I have Palia for.

267
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can always give it another go.

268
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the record, Psylocke is in it, but I think it's Quanon Psylocke.

269
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

270
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:32,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

271
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:43,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as... If I want my crafting, I go to Palia because I've gotten a lot better at some of the glitching.

272
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:55,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually saving up to buy yet another property because they have new houses out, but I don't want to destroy my old houses to build the new houses.

273
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:55,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

274
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The new houses are infinitely customizable.

275
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:59,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you can remove walls.

276
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You can add, like...

277
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,517
[SPEAKER_05]: different trim and vines to the roof and all kinds of stuff.

278
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty intense.

279
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:06,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

280
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,071
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

281
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Talia is still my happy place.

282
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That and the Avatar game.

283
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:36,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was just...

284
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:49,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking is that if I find matches that I thought I had fun in, whether or not I won, that I would just, you know, edit out some of the slow parts and put some silly commentary on it and upload it.

285
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took me like two hours to do it.

286
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:59,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I was watching another Dead by Daylight pig main and was like, you know, I may as well just do this while I'm watching.

287
00:20:59,450 --> 00:20:59,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

288
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:14,620
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will go ahead and give them a shout out it's Justin Bubba, UK streamer who congratulations on finishing your dissertation get your masters but we pig mains, we gotta stick together

289
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:20,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you mentioned TwitchCon and I kind of had a moment of like, oh crap, that is like right around the corner.

290
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,459
[SPEAKER_06]: That's less than a month away at this point, right?

291
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

292
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to finish fixing my pig cosplay.

293
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was considering doing a Legion again.

294
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just going to be pig for a day.

295
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

296
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:36,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

297
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:38,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that'd be fun.

298
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:39,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

299
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:41,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

300
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,059
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

301
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go over to Loki and check on your gaming week, Loki.

302
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,242
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just been Minecraft.

303
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:49,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been digging a hole.

304
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:49,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Very big hole.

305
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:54,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've been streaming Minecraft as well, right?

306
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:56,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, digging a hole.

307
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Just digging the hole?

308
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Big hole?

309
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's about 4.5 million blocks.

310
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it for all your enemies?

311
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I thought that wasn't possible in Minecraft.

312
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you hit the bottom eventually.

313
00:22:11,823 --> 00:22:29,815
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

314
00:22:31,212 --> 00:22:32,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Down into the core.

315
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there is a point where you hit the bottom.

316
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, you eventually get to the bedrock layer, and then if you know the way to exploit the game to break the bedrock layer, then you just open it up into the void, and if you jump into the void, then you die.

317
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:48,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing lives in the void.

318
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to conquer the void.

319
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,314
[SPEAKER_08]: You can dangle mobs into the void.

320
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:59,160
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a little buffer area that you can use entities, but other than that, you can't build down there.

321
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, I do love that idea.

322
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:09,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, you can also mod the game to have a higher build limit.

323
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:17,151
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do a couple thousand, then it just really tanks the computer, though, because it has to calculate all those extra blocks and everything.

324
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:23,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so digging a big hole actually might end up having to be about 50% bigger, too.

325
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:26,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, because I was looking at it the other day.

326
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:29,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how big it needs to be, but this is how big I'm starting.

327
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to talk about mods.

328
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:36,006
[SPEAKER_08]: There's lots of stuff with mods.

329
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:36,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can help you with mods.

330
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw.

331
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:41,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good luck on your hole digging, Loki.

332
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:49,145
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, most people I talk to on Blue Sky are looking to get their hole filled, so it's ironic that you're digging a giant hole in your game.

333
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:52,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have so much material left from the hole.

334
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I've got 200 plus shulker boxes of stone right now.

335
00:23:58,238 --> 00:23:58,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

336
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:26,438
[SPEAKER_08]: for comparison a shulker box is basically a chest so it's more than I'll ever need and that was just like the first 10 layers I stopped collecting materials now, I just don't collect anything, I just let it rot maybe copper, that's about it, but everything else I just let it die because I'm like, I cannot store all of this, nor would I ever use all of this and it would actually...

337
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:29,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It would probably lag out the game.

338
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:30,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

339
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:34,435
[SPEAKER_08]: You can build pig shrines.

340
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:38,121
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt is interested in the void, saying this void sounds pretty good.

341
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:39,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they allow early voting?

342
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the void might be a better place to live these days.

343
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:43,870
[SPEAKER_05]: They do not.

344
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,489
[SPEAKER_05]: They built Dead by Daylight and Roblox.

345
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet it could be done in Minecraft.

346
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:50,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.

347
00:24:50,994 --> 00:24:51,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

348
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:55,821
[SPEAKER_08]: I think someone did build something like that.

349
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:56,543
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends.

350
00:24:56,823 --> 00:25:06,718
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do some limited stuff with Redstone, or if you decide to go the route I did with Datapacks, you can do quite a bit more with that.

351
00:25:07,627 --> 00:25:09,990
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, you probably could do Dead by Daylight.

352
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:12,474
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be tricky.

353
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Tango did.

354
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:15,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I found it.

355
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead by Daylight Minecraft maps.

356
00:25:17,101 --> 00:25:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I bet some maps, especially like Leary's and stuff, I bet some maps are, I don't want to say easy to recreate Minecraft, but relatively versus other things.

357
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:29,258
[SPEAKER_08]: The maps are probably somewhat easy to create.

358
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,520
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the gameplay.

359
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Recreating the gameplay would be very difficult.

360
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:37,009
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd probably be able to have something where you could stand on a

361
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:41,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Pressure Plate 2, Fix, Generator, or something like that.

362
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone did Dead by Midnight.

363
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:51,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you could build some things that mimic the gameplay.

364
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:56,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone I knew recently built Clash of Clans.

365
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:12,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

366
00:26:13,456 --> 00:26:15,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, at that point that's kind of what you have to do.

367
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:34,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, just because the game making Sands of Time is essentially, it's a random, normally it's a random generated dungeon, and so because I have to make a dungeon that goes out in all different directions, like even the main room I think is like at least

368
00:26:35,174 --> 00:27:01,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, at least like 70 blocks by 70 blocks wide and right now the whole I have I think it's like 169 blocks by like 200 and something and then 90 blocks deep is what I was going for but I'm probably going to have to expand it at least another 100 or so blocks out the sides depending on how I end up deciding to lay everything out that's the problem is I don't have any idea how I'm going to lay anything out yet

369
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

370
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,692
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be fun.

371
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:08,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Folks in chat are talking about mobs.

372
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:16,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Loony Bard says, heck, there's a mob for Quiet Place, and that sounds kind of scary as well.

373
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:24,570
[SPEAKER_06]: But it made me think, okay, so speaking of scary mods, you know the thing that I'm seeing all the time now on...

374
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:29,937
[SPEAKER_06]: TikTok, that is a Roblox thing, like the newest thing in survival horror, okay?

375
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a video of it I can play here.

376
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:36,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a little harder for you guys to see, but I'll show it on our Twitch TV stream.

377
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:51,385
[SPEAKER_06]: This is called One Night at Rue's, and it's RuPaul's Drag Race, and it's like they have the workroom, and it's like a horror game, and you get chased around by this giant RuPaul that looks scary as fuck.

378
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, that like chases you around the shadows and stuff.

379
00:27:53,627 --> 00:28:01,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to see a place where maybe this person's getting chased by like Rue or something that is really scary when that thing is following you.

380
00:28:01,294 --> 00:28:04,037
[SPEAKER_06]: But it looks like Slenderman, but it's like RuPaul.

381
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:09,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously we'll do that laugh, that ah-ha-ha-ha, you know, that laugh that RuPaul does.

382
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:10,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just looks so scary.

383
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,266
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another one my kids are telling me about called 99 Nights.

384
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:14,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, wait, that's like an Ami game.

385
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, no, it's like nights as in nighttime.

386
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:20,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Not 99 Nights as in, you know...

387
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:22,215
[SPEAKER_08]: One million troops.

388
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,323
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in chat says, Roblox is scary enough as it is.

389
00:28:27,343 --> 00:28:28,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

390
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:34,653
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100Matt says, Rob, did you see that George A. Romero's daughter is coming out with a zombie movie, Queens of the Dead?

391
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:35,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see that.

392
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,137
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks like it'll be a lot of fun.

393
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:38,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to check that out at some point.

394
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,326
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRite says, you don't just lip sync for your life.

395
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:44,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good tagline.

396
00:28:44,387 --> 00:28:45,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good tagline.

397
00:28:45,828 --> 00:28:48,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that they're going to make like a big budget drag race movie?

398
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:55,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're actually making a movie to be on the big screen that RuPaul confirmed he's starring in this week.

399
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:55,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

400
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:58,259
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make a movie set in the drag race universe.

401
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:06,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the fuck that means because they've made other like media like what AJ and the Queen was practically and that got canceled after one season.

402
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:08,688
[SPEAKER_06]: There was that bitch who stole Christmas movie.

403
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:10,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't very good.

404
00:29:11,531 --> 00:29:12,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I...

405
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:15,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, yeah, that's going to be very interesting.

406
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:20,080
[SPEAKER_08]: When are the queens going to do some actual drag racing?

407
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Like all this promise of drag race and there's yet no racing going on.

408
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The promos for whatever season Sasha Colby won were all like racing themed.

409
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say the very, very first season was all racing themed too.

410
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:38,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, you know, now that the budget's bigger, whatever recent one that Sasha Colby won, they actually were posing with cars and shit.

411
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:40,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do lean into the jokes a lot.

412
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:42,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Just spin it off into like a Fast and the Furious series, you know?

413
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

414
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:47,871
[SPEAKER_06]: The fast and the fierce.

415
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:49,459
[SPEAKER_08]: The fast and the fierce?

416
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That has potential.

417
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:53,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

418
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:53,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

419
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

420
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:54,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

421
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:58,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, SC100 Matt says needs a kart racing game.

422
00:29:58,177 --> 00:29:58,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

423
00:29:59,179 --> 00:29:59,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

424
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

425
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:04,388
[SPEAKER_06]: They try to push season two cross worlds, right?

426
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: They try to push mobile game slop on me.

427
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:12,221
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some type of like match three RuPaul game that they try to push on me all the time and ads.

428
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:13,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no, thank you.

429
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.

430
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:17,451
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about my gaming week, which ironically does involve match three.

431
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:22,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, I will mention I'm still playing Final Fantasy 11 on Cat's Eye.

432
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:28,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm already like level 40 on Red Mage, like level 30 on Dancer, just because everything's like so hyper powered.

433
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:29,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's been fun to like play with some of my friends.

434
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:30,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

435
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,762
[SPEAKER_06]: But believe it or not, I've been playing something else too.

436
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:35,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, I'm playing other games.

437
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:39,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually checked out something new that just came out, but it's an old game that's new again.

438
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked out the Puzzle Quest.

439
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:48,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's called Immortal Edition, but it's basically the new version of Puzzle Quest that's 4K and all the DLC included and everything.

440
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:52,404
[SPEAKER_06]: It was only, I think, $11.99 on PlayStation right now.

441
00:30:52,504 --> 00:30:54,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's on sale the first week.

442
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:57,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And because PlayStation Stars is going away,

443
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had like $15 worth of gifts.

444
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:08,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ended up getting this game for free because I had like $15 worth of credit on PlayStation Store because of everything fading with PlayStation Stars.

445
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:13,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ended up getting the game for free and...

446
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:17,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Puzzle Quest, I mean, that game was out years ago on what, the PSP?

447
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the DS as well.

448
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on everything, I think, at one point.

449
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:29,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It's essentially a match-three game, but it's a little harder than that because you have to think, you know, you're always going up against some type of opponent.

450
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:37,134
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, you're going up against a spider or an undead rat or, you know, I'm sure later on you actually get to fight people, but I'm still in the early stages of the game.

451
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to...

452
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:42,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you do a match three, then your opponent does a match three.

453
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:49,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to think about what you're doing to the board and how that's going to affect the board to set up your opponent.

454
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:55,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the way you damage your opponent is that there's not just the regular colors that represent mana.

455
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:57,246
[SPEAKER_06]: There's red, yellow, green, blue.

456
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there's purple asterisks for XP.

457
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:03,416
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gold for gold.

458
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are skulls.

459
00:32:04,878 --> 00:32:20,946
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

460
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:46,647
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

461
00:32:46,627 --> 00:33:08,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

462
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:11,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream says, Puzzle Quest is underrated.

463
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

464
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:16,891
[SPEAKER_06]: And speaking of, the Marvel version has Captain Betsy Britton in it, so it's better than Rivals.

465
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

466
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:20,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Marvel had a spinoff Puzzle Quest.

467
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:22,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest was everywhere.

468
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,582
[SPEAKER_06]: There was, what, three Puzzle Quest games?

469
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:24,564
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the Marvel Puzzle Quest.

470
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:25,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It was everywhere.

471
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it just went away.

472
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:30,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like Puzzle Quest has been gone for like...

473
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:32,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say a decade, but at least since COVID.

474
00:33:32,236 --> 00:33:33,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen a new Puzzle Quest game in a while.

475
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,363
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what happened behind the scenes to let it come back.

476
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:41,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been following it that closely, but it's cool that it's back again.

477
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe they'll create more stuff in the future.

478
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:50,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember really liking Puzzle Quest 3 in particular, and I don't remember why, but maybe they'll go through and release the old games.

479
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:55,615
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, if you enjoy Match 3 and strategy games, I think Puzzle Quest is worth it.

480
00:33:55,595 --> 00:34:17,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this would be a really good candidate for the Switch though I do sort of wish I had this one on a more portable type of system it's on my I bought it on PlayStation 5 but um which is fine it looks really good for a puzzle game um but if I don't know if it's on Switch 2 but if it is that's probably the way to go with it to be honest um

481
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look really fast do research live to see if it's on yeah it does look like it is on Nintendo platforms it's on the regular Nintendo Switch and so I'm sure runs on Switch 2 as well so that might be the way to do it if you want a puzzle game to go on the go so that was my gaming week we're gonna move on we've got some headlines to cover in the gaming industry including one we brought up earlier and last week Loki some continued updates on this front yeah

482
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:54,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so Borderlands 4 has had a lot of issues with basically just optimization issues.

483
00:34:56,027 --> 00:35:03,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Overall, gameplay-wise, it's been pretty positive as far as the reviews go, but there are still some struggles with...

484
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:29,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Performance even on high-end hardware and one of the things that people are running into and this is actually on console too so outside of the whole PC realm there consoles have a really bad memory leak bug right now and so unfortunately it's not really something that they they're able to fix right away but they are working on it but in the meantime they're like well if

485
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:37,182
[SPEAKER_08]: If you run into this bug, which means after playing the game for long enough, it'll start dropping FPS.

486
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: You just have to save, quit, and restart.

487
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:41,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And away you go again.

488
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:45,492
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to know about this bug before releasing.

489
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:46,513
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to.

490
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:50,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Those playtesters test for hours and hours at a time.

491
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: This had to have come up.

492
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:54,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume so.

493
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:56,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume it did, but, you know.

494
00:35:56,884 --> 00:36:07,322
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I want to acknowledge, we all know that testers find bugs that then are discussed in some sort of forum about, is it worth the time to fix this bug or should we release anyway?

495
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:09,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't help but get this feeling.

496
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:15,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help but get this feeling that this release date for this game was non-negotiable under any circumstance.

497
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:18,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what these performance issues are leading me to believe.

498
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:19,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

499
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:26,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with that, you know, so they're running into, like I said, issues with like DLSS and the PC requirements and stuff like that.

500
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:35,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though folks have really powerful rigs, they're barely cracking like 60 FPS or, you know, they're still getting slowdowns and stuff like that.

501
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:41,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, I think as we were talking before, Randy Pitchford, not helpful in this situation.

502
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:46,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically just fighting everybody in social media and

503
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,269
[SPEAKER_08]: saying that, no, you're just losers with weak computers and that's why you can't run my perfect game.

504
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,431
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs a babysitter.

505
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:57,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you guys code your own Unreal 5 engine, you know, and then we'll be your customers.

506
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,483
[SPEAKER_08]: See how hard it is.

507
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:06,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, I don't know how far I want to go with this rant, but especially these days.

508
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:10,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Social Media, and in particularly, X and Twitter.

509
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:13,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know I've been bitching about Twitter ever since you know who bought it.

510
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a problem ever since then.

511
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean just within the last few months.

512
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what happened.

513
00:37:20,484 --> 00:37:26,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, logging onto that site, I can't believe is good for anybody's mental health.

514
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:47,832
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody's mental health unless you are maybe a somebody who makes their living off adult entertainment and your only focus on that site is the adult side of things maybe but even then the worst of the worst people are on that website and responding to things and stuff and I just I don't see how anybody can get joy

515
00:37:47,812 --> 00:38:08,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of a post on that website anymore And this is just Randy Pitchford He just does this Because even before the game was released People were complaining about the price of it And he's like Well, I guess you're just not really true fans then Because you're not paying $80 for our game It's just like He doesn't shut the fuck up About stuff

516
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:16,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Randy, what happened to all that porn that was on your USB drive that you left at a fucking medieval times?

517
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:17,449
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened to that shit?

518
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:21,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's bring that up since you're being a little asshole on social media.

519
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:24,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Just delete the account.

520
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:30,212
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't like a delete your account, I hate you.

521
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:34,861
[SPEAKER_06]: This is delete your account for your mental health and well-being.

522
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:37,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Delete your account to make you feel better.

523
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying to Randy Pitchford.

524
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Delete your account because...

525
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:52,108
[SPEAKER_08]: you won't be so stressed out all the time he could have just it was so easy for him just to take the W on this for people to completely forget all he had to do

526
00:38:52,477 --> 00:39:12,392
[SPEAKER_08]: because the game was getting great reviews already is go hey we hear some of you're struggling with you know optimization issues in the game we're working on it when we hear you we're working on it done there you go everyone's like cool they're on it the game's great let's let's go you know everybody would have been positive about it it would have been a lot of good

527
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:14,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Press and PR for the company.

528
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:19,285
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, Randy Pitchford has to be correct all the time and just made it completely.

529
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: It is now overshadowing how good the game is because of his dumbass responses on social media.

530
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I unfortunately think he's in a position as far as ownership of the company that no one can really tell him to stop.

531
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:33,891
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

532
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,126
[SPEAKER_08]: People should tell him to stop.

533
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:46,079
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you could have this, you know, this could have been painted in a completely different light if you would just shut the hell up.

534
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:52,028
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw on chat says social media in general isn't good for anyone's mental health, to be honest.

535
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to argue with that.

536
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:55,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You are correct on that.

537
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:56,976
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's been just fine for me.

538
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:01,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Sky is fine because I think Blue Sky is extremely curatable.

539
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:04,207
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no algorithm on Blue Sky unless you opt into one.

540
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:08,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that is crucial for why Blue Sky has a different feel to it.

541
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:10,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you build your experience on Blue Sky.

542
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:11,760
[SPEAKER_06]: You truly do.

543
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,425
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no other entity pushing it at you.

544
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:33,392
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

545
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:37,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It automatically removes my tweet and you don't even see what that person quoted.

546
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:38,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You just see whatever they said.

547
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:48,148
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually didn't block that person because the other thing you can do on Blue Sky is you can simply go to that little post and you can say detach post.

548
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:51,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And it automatically – it will replace the post with deleted by author.

549
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked at this person's timeline.

550
00:40:54,094 --> 00:40:55,476
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they do is quote post.

551
00:40:55,656 --> 00:40:56,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like –

552
00:40:57,402 --> 00:40:59,304
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is a security measure.

553
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:03,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot easier to weed out the... It is.

554
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:04,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

555
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:05,672
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.

556
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:06,593
[SPEAKER_06]: The Unwantables.

557
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, Facebook has been, and I know, I shouldn't be on it and I shouldn't use it.

558
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:19,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like in some ways this is a necessary evil for promotion, but I'm sort of able to cross-post from Instagram.

559
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:20,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what people say about Twitter.

560
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,713
[SPEAKER_06]: But Facebook is...

561
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:42,968
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

562
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that has gotten me to look at Twitter recently is the simple fact that there's a DBD meetup.

563
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the only place the information is posted.

564
00:41:52,452 --> 00:42:01,842
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing I've really been seeing on... I go to Facebook for is to read the people complaining in the neighborhood, like the local city chats.

565
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:11,453
[SPEAKER_08]: But it just makes you realize how people are in the public, which is bad.

566
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:12,437
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

567
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:33,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, as Joan Hunter-Matt in chat says, be less like Randy and more like Yoshi P. Well, what a good transition to our next story to talk a little bit about what is going on with Final Fantasy XIV and the fact that, you know, Yoshi P has been, who of course is the producer of that game, Naoki Yoshida, who has worked on other games like Final Fantasy XVI.

568
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:39,389
[SPEAKER_06]: He's, you know, a pretty popular guy because he did revive Final Fantasy XIV literally from the dead.

569
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

570
00:42:40,711 --> 00:43:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

571
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:18,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company and he says that he's more of a businessman than necessarily a creative in Final Fantasy XIV kind of interesting sort of take on it but I think realistic to like where he's at at this point um

572
00:43:18,393 --> 00:43:24,022
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not bored with the project because there is so much more he still wants to do with the game.

573
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:40,367
[SPEAKER_06]: He says,

574
00:43:40,347 --> 00:43:41,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Same.

575
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:57,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

576
00:43:57,053 --> 00:44:23,837
[SPEAKER_06]: you know sort of situation especially Naoki Yoshida who is so popular he gets pulled into these other things like wasn't he I don't remember if that's still the case but he got pulled onto Square's board about Final Fantasy at some point because because of the fact that Final Fantasy 14 is still a money machine for Square Square makes more money off of Final Fantasy 14 than most of their games right now sadly including Final Fantasy 16 which was something that Naoki Yoshida was also a part of but

577
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:30,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I think also 16 was extremely limited by being a PlayStation 5 exclusive at the time that it came out.

578
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:38,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to get that to more places, but I don't know how many more people still want to play Final Fantasy 16 at this point that haven't yet.

579
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:43,360
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100Matt says, Yoshi P seems like he's working too hard.

580
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he should take a break on things and work on a fun project like a Chrono Trigger remake.

581
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:56,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and Sakurai should start a club and it should be like, don't call us.

582
00:44:56,962 --> 00:44:57,582
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the club.

583
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:59,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not call.

584
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:00,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not call.

585
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:02,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do not.

586
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:03,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do not.

587
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:05,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We're busy making a game.

588
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:05,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not call.

589
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,851
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what him and Sakurai should do.

590
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:10,193
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to ask us for anything.

591
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:12,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make the game we want to make and you're going to like it.

592
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:15,858
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my dream collab right there.

593
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:19,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yoshi P and Sakurai making a game that you have no input on.

594
00:45:21,968 --> 00:45:24,791
[SPEAKER_06]: You, the gamer, have no input on this game.

595
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: You are not allowed to say anything.

596
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:27,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just going to buy it.

597
00:45:28,454 --> 00:45:32,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it is.

598
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:32,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

599
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,501
[SPEAKER_06]: D'Artencio says, don't forget about Katsuhiro.

600
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:37,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ask me for shit.

601
00:45:37,203 --> 00:45:38,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Harada from Tekken.

602
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:39,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent call-out.

603
00:45:40,106 --> 00:45:40,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent call-out.

604
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:43,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Should absolutely be an advisor on that game as well.

605
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:44,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So there we go.

606
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:50,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurai, Yoshida, Harada,

607
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurai Yoshida Harada.

608
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:54,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we can't really get an acronym out of that.

609
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:57,847
[SPEAKER_06]: But those three get together and you're not going to say shit.

610
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just going to buy the game and you don't get to talk.

611
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit in the corner until it's done.

612
00:46:02,892 --> 00:46:07,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You sit in the waiting room and we'll call you when it's ready.

613
00:46:07,477 --> 00:46:08,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Sayoha?

614
00:46:08,377 --> 00:46:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

615
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:09,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Sayoha.

616
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's their first syllables.

617
00:46:14,724 --> 00:46:17,727
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's not like a dirty word I'm not aware of, then great.

618
00:46:18,095 --> 00:46:19,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to my knowledge.

619
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:20,582
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

620
00:46:21,565 --> 00:46:22,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

621
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:28,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I said there was some good news tonight, and I look at this and go, this is kind of neat to hear about, DarkSakura.

622
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:30,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed, indeed.

623
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:40,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So, now you know that a lot of my focus of what I like to look at in the video game industry is the education and spreading of positivity.

624
00:46:41,483 --> 00:46:54,801
[SPEAKER_05]: And what an article I found is about indigenous video game makers who have done games in the Taino and Ojibwe languages.

625
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:56,623
[SPEAKER_05]: They

626
00:46:58,105 --> 00:47:07,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to see if I can find... A woman named Elaine Gomez who owns Midnight Hour Games.

627
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:16,287
[SPEAKER_05]: She developed a game called The Vegigantes about the Vegigantes masks.

628
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:24,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It's folklore and indigenous roots and was taking language classes in her...

629
00:47:24,937 --> 00:47:31,884
[SPEAKER_05]: The tribe that she belongs to, I'm going to mispronounce this, Higwayagua Taino of the Caribbean.

630
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:38,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they decided to translate the Gigantes into that language.

631
00:47:40,013 --> 00:47:44,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And her chief was like, hey, you got to keep making these games.

632
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:47,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there you go.

633
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:53,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And trying to spread the culture and awareness of her ancestry.

634
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,805
[SPEAKER_06]: These types of stories that make me go, video game is an art form, right?

635
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:00,966
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about sharing a story.

636
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:03,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about sharing a feeling.

637
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about sharing a passion.

638
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:10,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see that all those things are present in this type of game.

639
00:48:10,459 --> 00:48:13,002
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another game.

640
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:19,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one, I'm going to mispronounce her name too, but Anagukwe Hermes Roach.

641
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:42,717
[SPEAKER_05]: who is a designer and developer and co-director for Reclaim, being developed by Grassroots Indigenous Multimedia and grew up near the La Corte Reservation and made a game dedicated.

642
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:46,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So there we go.

643
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:51,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually trying to see if I just realized I can... You can find the links to it?

644
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm actually trying to get a little bit of what the game looks like here.

645
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:54,771
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

646
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a little YouTube.

647
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:59,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a pre-alpha, but at least you can see a little bit of what this game looks like.

648
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:00,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try to get past the title screen.

649
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:01,237
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

650
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:03,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a really cool art style.

651
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's all hand-drawn.

652
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I will link what I have as well for the game studios and whatnot in the chat.

653
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

654
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:35,459
[SPEAKER_05]: MidnightHourGames.com and it's G-I-M-O-J-I-B-W-E.org So we have GolfIndigoMike-OscarJulietIndigoBravoWhiskeyEcho.org Nice.

655
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:37,141
[SPEAKER_06]: The art style in this game is really cool.

656
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:37,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this.

657
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really striking to me.

658
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:45,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I saw that, I was like, I might have to wait.

659
00:49:45,748 --> 00:49:46,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a backlog.

660
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to bring it up and showcase these games.

661
00:49:51,173 --> 00:49:52,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cool.

662
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:54,237
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

663
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on from low budget to big budget, Loki.

664
00:49:58,441 --> 00:49:59,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I should say indie, not low budget.

665
00:49:59,903 --> 00:50:00,944
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds demeaning.

666
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie to big budget, Loki.

667
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:03,126
Okay.

668
00:50:03,477 --> 00:50:20,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, so Metroid Prime 4 we know is looking pretty impressive, but apparently there's some information that has leaked allegedly saying that it is also the most expensive project Nintendo has undertaken.

669
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:25,894
[SPEAKER_08]: That it had a $100 million budget.

670
00:50:25,914 --> 00:50:26,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

671
00:50:26,663 --> 00:50:30,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it says Prime costs about, well, they said $10 million.

672
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:33,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Prime 1 costs $10 million to make.

673
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:36,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Prime 4 is costing about $100 million to make.

674
00:50:36,817 --> 00:50:40,102
[SPEAKER_08]: The game needs to sell between $4.5 to $5 million to break even.

675
00:50:40,482 --> 00:50:42,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't think it's going to have a problem doing that.

676
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:47,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be a problem for them to sell that either, to be honest, especially during the holidays.

677
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:54,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, when asked about how he obtained the figures, that's what I've been told.

678
00:50:54,575 --> 00:50:56,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll take your word for it.

679
00:50:56,139 --> 00:51:05,563
[SPEAKER_08]: My uncle works at Nintendo, so he knows Mario personally, and this is the information that Mario gave him.

680
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:07,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

681
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:29,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll see what ends up being...

682
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:38,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think it also is why, you know, the flip side of that is also why I think there were some people that were surprised when this was announced that it was coming for the original Switch.

683
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:45,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people at some point felt, oh, because it was rebooted, because it's been so long, this is a Switch 2 sort of launch game.

684
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, I think I had that perspective for a hot minute.

685
00:51:48,107 --> 00:51:48,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you kind of

686
00:51:48,828 --> 00:52:16,962
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

687
00:52:16,942 --> 00:52:22,155
[SPEAKER_06]: and or even myself and I don't want to spend all that money on a Switch 2 but I'm going to get him a new game.

688
00:52:22,175 --> 00:52:23,318
[SPEAKER_06]: This is available on the Switch.

689
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:30,276
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do think Metroid Prime 4 does fine and makes his money back because it is on the original Switch no matter how crappy it runs.

690
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:48,872
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

691
00:52:49,443 --> 00:52:51,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it should be cool.

692
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, Tigerclaw says we have Samus riding a motorcycle.

693
00:52:54,391 --> 00:52:55,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is.

694
00:52:55,814 --> 00:52:58,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody rides motorcycle now in Nintendo.

695
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:09,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you right now, as if my anticipation for Tron Ares couldn't get shot in the foot any harder, all I have to tell you is that, reminder, it's a Disney movie and...

696
00:53:09,878 --> 00:53:11,903
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to say, right?

697
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all can read between the lines right now, right?

698
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:21,306
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, I'm more excited about Metroid Prime 4 and its light cycle races than anything else right now.

699
00:53:21,944 --> 00:53:23,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I listened to the soundtrack.

700
00:53:23,687 --> 00:53:25,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of underwhelmed.

701
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:27,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as good as the last one.

702
00:53:28,276 --> 00:53:29,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It was never going to be.

703
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but Nine Inch Nails is good as well.

704
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:38,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Wendy Carlos could rise from the dead and do the soundtrack and it still wouldn't be.

705
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:39,197
[SPEAKER_06]: She's not dead.

706
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:40,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought she was.

707
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

708
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought she was!

709
00:53:43,185 --> 00:53:46,029
[SPEAKER_08]: But she could rise from the dead if she wanted to as well.

710
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,353
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's how talented she is.

711
00:53:48,373 --> 00:53:49,996
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Wendy Carlos is still alive.

712
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:51,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, oh my god.

713
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:52,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Wendy.

714
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,663
[SPEAKER_05]: She's pretty old.

715
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:54,785
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, she was born in 1939.

716
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:59,032
[SPEAKER_05]: She's 85 years old and still going strong in Rhode Island.

717
00:53:59,052 --> 00:53:59,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's embarrassing.

718
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:00,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Wendy.

719
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:03,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was a story that came out.

720
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:04,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm mixing up with another composer.

721
00:54:04,902 --> 00:54:04,962
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

722
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I do still want to see Tron Ares.

723
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:09,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I haven't, I just, it's like, I'm going to see it.

724
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:10,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yar.

725
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's, it's, it's just like, I don't know though.

726
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I see everything Tron that's happening.

727
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:22,546
[SPEAKER_08]: It says Jared Leto.

728
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:24,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Why Jared Leto?

729
00:54:24,108 --> 00:54:24,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

730
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:25,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

731
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:26,933
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

732
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:29,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go back.

733
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:31,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about another big budget game.

734
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:34,330
[SPEAKER_06]: At least, you know, especially in other countries, this game is huge.

735
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:39,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Football Manager 26, but this is the kind of football that, you know, is real footballers.

736
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:40,545
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actual football.

737
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:42,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we call it in the States soccer.

738
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:43,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

739
00:54:43,231 --> 00:55:02,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Football Manager 26 is going to include the officially licensed Barclays Women's Super League and National Women's Soccer League and other women's competition.

740
00:55:03,153 --> 00:55:11,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe I'm saying this, but this marks the first time that women's soccer has been featured in the long-running management sim.

741
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:20,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the year 2025, or on the box, 2026, and here we are.

742
00:55:20,907 --> 00:55:24,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the debut of women's soccer was announced back in 2021.

743
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:31,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to come out in Football Manager 2025, but that game was canceled.

744
00:55:31,058 --> 00:55:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Sports Interactive instead switched the attention to Football Manager 26, which is coming out on November 4th.

745
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:56,742
[SPEAKER_06]: When the developer was kind of asked about this early on, the prospects of adding women's soccer and football to the various game modes, they said they were only going to do so once it was able to offer the same level of depth and authenticity as it does for men's soccer.

746
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the popularity of women's soccer has grown enormously throughout the world.

747
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:13,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And Sports Interactive has said that for Football Manager 2026, there is one ecosystem and you are not exclusively limited to men or women's soccer on one save.

748
00:56:13,614 --> 00:56:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: In ensuring that the recreation of women's soccer is realistic, they consulted real life players, clubs, organization, managers, the people involved.

749
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:22,968
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great news.

750
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:23,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

751
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:27,473
[SPEAKER_06]: 14 playable leagues across 11 nations at launch.

752
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:30,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Leagues in Germany, France, Japan, Australia, and more.

753
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:31,898
[SPEAKER_06]: England, the US.

754
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:37,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the database for Football Manager 26, 36,000 players.

755
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:41,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And that takes 40 researchers to make this game.

756
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:43,010
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why this is a big budget game.

757
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,993
[SPEAKER_06]: But these games are huge.

758
00:56:45,033 --> 00:56:51,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not EA, but it's still like, you know, these soccer games worldwide are tremendously popular.

759
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

760
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:56,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But congratulations on finally getting on board with this.

761
00:56:56,927 --> 00:57:02,534
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO 100 Matt also points out, you know, kind of the growth in other forms of media.

762
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:09,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, SGO 100 Matt says the women's leagues have been getting good amount of TV play internationally.

763
00:57:09,243 --> 00:57:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So that has changed in recent time.

764
00:57:11,727 --> 00:57:15,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And to all this, I say WNBA next, please.

765
00:57:17,182 --> 00:57:27,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you bring out all the receipts on ways the WNBA has been represented, this is completely stemmed from my sour grapes over the fact that we haven't had the Monarchs here locally in years.

766
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So until the Monarchs are back, I'm always going to bitch.

767
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:37,022
[SPEAKER_05]: A while back, they were great and it was really nice talking with them.

768
00:57:37,263 --> 00:57:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, back when I was at my old job.

769
00:57:42,005 --> 00:57:44,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had so much fun when I went to Monarchs games.

770
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:46,432
[SPEAKER_06]: They were just, it's a different vibe.

771
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:48,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, how do I put this?

772
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:53,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's less serious, but not in a negative way.

773
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:56,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just feels fun.

774
00:57:56,528 --> 00:57:56,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

775
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:57,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

776
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,812
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

777
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:01,516
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me there's more love there.

778
00:58:01,536 --> 00:58:02,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

779
00:58:02,358 --> 00:58:08,788
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is wild to me that we had a world championship team here in Sacramento and they got rid of them.

780
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid.

781
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, maybe some other sport good stuff.

782
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:18,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, DarkSakura?

783
00:58:18,592 --> 00:58:19,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

784
00:58:20,374 --> 00:58:32,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we know we are big Kunio fans in this house, and there are more Kunio games that are being localized coming out in the US for the first time.

785
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:40,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We are getting River City Ball and Brawl Bundle.

786
00:58:40,443 --> 00:59:01,118
[SPEAKER_05]: being published by RetroBit which the two games that are there is River City Basketball or Neketsu Koha Ganbare Basket and then there's also River City Fighting Legend Neketsu Kalto Densetsu

787
00:59:01,098 --> 00:59:06,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one, the basketball games, is Kunio gets a trip to the U.S.

788
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:11,671
[SPEAKER_05]: on a quiz show and goes to play at a basketball tournament.

789
00:59:12,372 --> 00:59:23,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in the fighting legend, Kunio has a note on his locker that says there's a fighting tournament, and of course he's going to fight.

790
00:59:24,587 --> 00:59:28,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a full set.

791
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:29,873
[SPEAKER_05]: You get...

792
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:33,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what we have here.

793
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:43,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have... The whole thing is going to be €109.99, €129.99, and Canadian €154.99.

794
00:59:46,051 --> 00:59:49,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will have... Let's see.

795
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:52,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So this first official cartridge release outside of Japan.

796
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:57,750
[SPEAKER_05]: A Zanshin cartridge for 8-bit consoles.

797
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:05,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Number Deluxe Hardcover Cartridge Packaging, Full Colored Instruction Manual, Exclusive Acrylic Cartridge Display Stand.

798
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:15,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's if you get... That's just for River City Fighting Legend, and it alone would be $60 US.

799
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:18,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

800
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:42,486
[SPEAKER_05]: basketball it would be again $60 US on its own and it comes with again the cartridge release street chalk cartridge for 8-bit consoles number deluxe hardcover cartridge packaging full color instruction manual exclusive acrylic cartridge display stand I just want a poster

801
01:00:43,715 --> 01:00:47,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of fun stuff to come with this, and it's kind of neat that this is happening.

802
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:52,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's maybe, you know, 30 years too late, but it's never too late, but you know.

803
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:54,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of hot-blooded action.

804
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:55,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it sure is.

805
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:57,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang, Kunio gets around.

806
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:01,735
[SPEAKER_05]: He can play dodgeball, and basketball, and baseball.

807
01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:08,362
[SPEAKER_06]: As Joan Hunter-Matt says, I was wondering why it was so expensive until I realized it was an 8-bit console cart.

808
01:01:08,422 --> 01:01:09,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

809
01:01:09,652 --> 01:01:15,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, you know, those things might be a little more expensive right now just because I don't need to explain it to you.

810
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all know why.

811
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:16,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

812
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:21,860
[SPEAKER_05]: No, really?

813
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, Loki, from from classics to new stuff.

814
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:34,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Microsoft is, of course, shoving Copilot into every goddamn thing you don't want it to be in.

815
01:01:34,762 --> 01:01:35,583
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

816
01:01:36,124 --> 01:01:41,071
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox mobile app is not immune to that crap.

817
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:42,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And so guess what?

818
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:42,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming!

819
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:45,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Your Copilot that you don't want.

820
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my Mac.

821
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:54,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stupid little child poking and going, hey, you're going the wrong way.

822
01:01:54,976 --> 01:01:56,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you're going the wrong way.

823
01:01:56,404 --> 01:01:57,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Clippy's back.

824
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:02,610
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Clippy being back would be way better than this crap.

825
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,136
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Clippy got melted into a microchip and now he powers Copilot.

826
01:02:07,617 --> 01:02:11,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Clippy got melted down into a computer chip that now powers Copilot.

827
01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:13,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Clippy's better than that.

828
01:02:13,645 --> 01:02:19,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I can turn off Apple Intelligence and I can tell Siri to shut the fuck up.

829
01:02:21,076 --> 01:02:23,820
[SPEAKER_05]: She says she doesn't like when I talk like that, but still.

830
01:02:24,526 --> 01:02:25,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I will throw this out here, though.

831
01:02:26,268 --> 01:02:28,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I don't love this either.

832
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:44,226
[SPEAKER_06]: However, in the interest of looking at a story from all angles, I know that many people, when they get stuck in a video game, are going to go to Google or they're going to go to Bing, maybe, and they're going to type their question, like, where is the exit in World 3 or, you know, whatever it is.

833
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:52,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And oftentimes what's going to generate right off the bat is going to be Gemini or whatever the Google's AI thing is called with the answer to that.

834
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:53,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

835
01:02:53,095 --> 01:02:54,818
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wrong half the time.

836
01:02:55,058 --> 01:02:56,741
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a key point.

837
01:02:57,062 --> 01:03:01,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But aren't a lot of people sort of already relying on this, I guess is my point.

838
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:02,191
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the point?

839
01:03:02,531 --> 01:03:03,553
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the point here?

840
01:03:03,573 --> 01:03:05,035
[SPEAKER_08]: To collect more data on you?

841
01:03:05,316 --> 01:03:10,665
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm searching for whatever this is, like the question that I have, like...

842
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:14,012
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna have the same data.

843
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:21,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if I'm using Bing or using the Microsoft Search or whatever, like, I just don't see the point of shoving this into every single app.

844
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I know I don't use it.

845
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:32,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, even I had a coworker try to use it for, like, generating AI images for something funny.

846
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:34,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, they could not get it to work right.

847
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:36,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

848
01:03:36,397 --> 01:03:36,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dumb.

849
01:03:37,919 --> 01:03:46,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, I was going to ask when you're telling Siri to shut the hell up, did you go, I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.

850
01:03:49,672 --> 01:03:52,556
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just like, I wasn't talking to you.

851
01:03:53,217 --> 01:03:54,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

852
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, that's not what I asked, bitch.

853
01:03:59,444 --> 01:04:00,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Please watch your language.

854
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:25,185
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says physical game manuals and guides died for this actually no they existed so that all of the words inside of them could be stolen I mean it's I know jokes are funny and the truth isn't always funny but that's my honest answer to that

855
01:04:26,465 --> 01:04:37,167
[SPEAKER_08]: and yet with all of that information at its fingertips it can't fucking answer questions correctly or do proper math most of the time so a funny thing to do

856
01:04:38,243 --> 01:05:04,909
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

857
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:23,725
[SPEAKER_08]: and I bet most of you don't even know what half these fucking buttons do on this thing it's not using it for math necessarily like using it for like math problems you know people do though I'm sure they do but like it's more of like I've used it for building for me for numbers

858
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:30,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's more of being unable to do simple things like, hey, I am giving you this word.

859
01:05:30,448 --> 01:05:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: How many letters are in this word?

860
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:33,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And it gets it wrong every time.

861
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:39,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, hey, count the number of times the letter T appears in this word, and it can't do that.

862
01:05:39,676 --> 01:05:47,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's the simple things that it just gets confused on, which I don't understand how it can't count.

863
01:05:48,423 --> 01:05:52,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can code something to count, you know, the characters in a string.

864
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:52,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I

865
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:58,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You would think you would know how to do that.

866
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:03,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream says also you can just type math into Google and it tells you the answer right in the search bar.

867
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:06,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, that is a thing that Google did before AI.

868
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is useful.

869
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:13,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you're like how many quarts in so many teaspoons or whatever.

870
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:17,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It will do those conversions of things I can never remember.

871
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:24,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to figure out like the mass of this container when it wasn't listed and I needed to measure how much food was in it.

872
01:06:24,511 --> 01:06:24,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

873
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:37,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And just put in the, you know, the one thing I do like is that on the sites where it will not just give you the answer, but it will also show you the calculation for it.

874
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:47,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And that for me is better because at least if I have the formula and I'm not where I can do anything about it, I have a way to calculate it.

875
01:06:47,894 --> 01:06:49,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie to all of her computers.

876
01:06:49,696 --> 01:06:52,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, don't forget to show your work on that math problem.

877
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:57,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honestly, though, it is good to see.

878
01:06:58,668 --> 01:07:04,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I'm just saying it's what is going to make that be more, I guess, more accurate.

879
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:12,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Accurate may not be the right word, but it shows that at least the calculation is following actual numbers.

880
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:20,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Formula and Procedure and isn't just something that was pulled out of a computer ass.

881
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in our day, we had legit calculators.

882
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:27,116
[SPEAKER_06]: They were Texas instruments and you hacked it to play Dope Wars and Snake.

883
01:07:27,637 --> 01:07:29,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell fucking yeah.

884
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:30,743
[SPEAKER_05]: We played Pole Position.

885
01:07:31,617 --> 01:07:36,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a friend who flat out programmed Pole Position on their graphing calculator.

886
01:07:36,703 --> 01:07:44,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Pole Position was available when the big thing was running those in assembly so that they would be much higher performance and stuff.

887
01:07:44,573 --> 01:07:46,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember Pole Position.

888
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:59,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, essentially with any of the high school stuff, because we just went through the whole back to school night stuff, a lot of the things where there's concerns about AI use and abuse or whatever, they will just...

889
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:06,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Make them do it on paper in class so that you can't use AI for that stuff.

890
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:15,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Aside from, I think they were still using Grammarly and that type of stuff for proofreading, but not for actual generation of all that stuff.

891
01:08:15,937 --> 01:08:22,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe, I think there was another tool that was for citing sources or something that helps you find sources for things.

892
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, it's...

893
01:08:25,803 --> 01:08:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

894
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:28,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's at a point where it's extremely useful yet.

895
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:43,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I would want it, like, more personalized and intuitive and not as some, like, sort of backdoor for them to advertise to me, which I have to say, despite the fact that, like,

896
01:08:44,045 --> 01:08:47,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally every company is stealing all of my data, right?

897
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:51,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they still can't push accurate ads to me about what my interests are.

898
01:08:51,617 --> 01:08:54,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I just, it boggles my mind.

899
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:58,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you literally have all of my data, you still can't figure that out?

900
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes you think AI is going to be any better at that?

901
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:06,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just, you are already bad at your job if you have all of the data and yet still don't know what I want.

902
01:09:07,741 --> 01:09:12,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see my Blue Sky post about the Instagram ad I got pushed this week with the holiday sweaters?

903
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:31,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I was getting pushed holiday sweaters on Instagram and it would be like a pink, I don't even know if I can say, like there's literally one of them, I can't say the word or we might get banned from Twitch, but there was one, I think I can say cunt, there was a sweater that was pink and it said cunt on it.

904
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just it.

905
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a holiday sweater that I could wear to my aunt's house for a holiday.

906
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:38,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine me walking to the door with a pink holiday sweater?

907
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't I have this?

908
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:44,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a neon green one that had the F slur is the one that I don't think I can say.

909
01:09:44,692 --> 01:09:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The F slur.

910
01:09:45,994 --> 01:09:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want the one that says the other.

911
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:56,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was two, it looked like pixel art of two rats smoking.

912
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:56,492
Yeah.

913
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:58,774
[SPEAKER_06]: on a holiday sweater.

914
01:09:58,895 --> 01:09:59,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Like why?

915
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:04,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I might buy that one because that's the one I could actually probably get away with wearing on a stage somewhere.

916
01:10:04,964 --> 01:10:09,631
[SPEAKER_06]: But and then there was one that said ketamine and it was all like drawn and like chalk and stuff.

917
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:12,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just like, what in the world?

918
01:10:12,155 --> 01:10:14,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, why am I getting pushed these ads?

919
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:17,783
[SPEAKER_06]: To which Alan replies, oh, that might be my fault.

920
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:20,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, what in the fuck are you looking at?

921
01:10:22,477 --> 01:10:23,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they'll do that.

922
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:28,203
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll advertise to other people in your household stuff that they think that you want.

923
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:29,224
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's always wrong.

924
01:10:29,244 --> 01:10:31,846
[SPEAKER_06]: That is how Alan figured out my Christmas gift last year.

925
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:37,151
[SPEAKER_06]: He knew to get me the Atari jacket because I was on Atari's site.

926
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:40,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see if they had a new version of the woodgrain hoodie that I really liked.

927
01:10:40,815 --> 01:10:42,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wanted to see what clothes they had.

928
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:49,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw that leather jacket and I started looking at it and it started pushing Alan the ad for it because we live together.

929
01:10:49,443 --> 01:10:53,417
[SPEAKER_06]: and he ended up buying it because he's like, oh, Rob would probably like this.

930
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:55,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, God damn it.

931
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:58,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let them know it's working.

932
01:11:00,698 --> 01:11:02,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

933
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:04,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I hate.

934
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:06,927
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says sometimes it's an accident.

935
01:11:07,228 --> 01:11:10,313
[SPEAKER_06]: You open a page or something and then you get recommended stuff from it.

936
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:11,454
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the worst.

937
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, my fat finger tapped an Instagram ad and now I am forever getting ads for, like, I don't know, potpourri or something I don't fucking want.

938
01:11:20,929 --> 01:11:22,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just wild.

939
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

940
01:11:23,432 --> 01:11:24,814
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want any potpourri.

941
01:11:24,854 --> 01:11:27,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want things to smell like an attic.

942
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:29,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Like grandma's house?

943
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:37,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when... Do you remember when, like, potpourri became really popular in the 80s?

944
01:11:37,653 --> 01:11:38,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

945
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And everywhere you went smelled like...

946
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:47,514
[SPEAKER_05]: and Old Apothecary.

947
01:11:47,534 --> 01:11:47,854
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

948
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get to the classic game of the week, I want to talk about this as a follow-up to something we talked about last week.

949
01:11:53,600 --> 01:12:02,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the saga of the Sega dev kit that was bought at an auction type of thing or an unloading and then now it became a whole mess?

950
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:07,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, an interesting twist in this whole thing.

951
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: It's full of cockroaches.

952
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,738
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

953
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:12,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's covered in bees!

954
01:12:13,244 --> 01:12:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's no B's that I know of.

955
01:12:17,091 --> 01:12:26,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, apparently the company that Sega used to clear the Brentford offices is a registered charity.

956
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:28,653
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the latest twist.

957
01:12:28,673 --> 01:12:34,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So now Sega is now essentially accusing a charity of theft.

958
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:39,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, there's a lot of on-edge people with this whole conversation and so forth.

959
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:45,278
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of allegedlys and maybes and he said, they said, she said thing going on here.

960
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:52,313
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is the latest twist is that now apparently it was a charity organization, which I actually – there are like –

961
01:12:52,293 --> 01:13:05,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you hear the commercials on the radio or whatever all the time about donate your car to this charity and then it's a tax write-off for you and they turn around and sell you a car and they make the money, they get people to donate their time to fix up cars.

962
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:09,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, charities do get involved in this sort of work sometimes.

963
01:13:10,313 --> 01:13:12,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not outside, I mean, I know it's Britain.

964
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:16,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about this.

965
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, that'd be like if I was...

966
01:13:20,204 --> 01:13:28,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I had my massive estate sale and our fine diamonds got mixed up with the linens and we accidentally donated it to Goodwill.

967
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:35,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I going to go sue Goodwill or try to get my diamonds back because I'm a dumbass that just accidentally threw that stuff out?

968
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:44,406
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I've seen the girl whose parents in the estate sale or grandparents had the photo album donated to Goodwill found the book and bought it for like a dime.

969
01:13:45,179 --> 01:14:00,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, like, that's fine if you repurchase your stuff, but, like, there should be no expectation that, like, oh, well, you gave this stuff to them and you didn't know what you had, so... Tough beans, like, I don't know, like... Just let it go.

970
01:14:01,782 --> 01:14:06,869
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's gonna be, you know, getting any sort of industry secrets based off this crap.

971
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:10,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean... Ugh, never mind.

972
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:11,897
[SPEAKER_05]: These people.

973
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't...

974
01:14:13,225 --> 01:14:19,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to our next segment and look back fondly on something in gaming's history.

975
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:37,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

976
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:40,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

977
01:14:41,339 --> 01:14:43,142
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, this is an interesting one.

978
01:14:43,222 --> 01:14:44,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited to hear about this.

979
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:47,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your pick for the classic game of the week?

980
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:53,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game I've been waiting to do just because it's... It was a fun game.

981
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Drunken Robot Pornography.

982
01:14:56,887 --> 01:14:57,528
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a great name.

983
01:14:57,548 --> 01:14:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Had the best intro song.

984
01:15:01,254 --> 01:15:01,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

985
01:15:01,825 --> 01:15:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, drunken robot pornography.

986
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,354
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bit of a story about this.

987
01:15:10,438 --> 01:15:17,910
[SPEAKER_05]: For a post that was by one of the developers of the game,

988
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:47,813
[SPEAKER_05]: DejaVon Games

989
01:15:48,248 --> 01:15:57,056
[SPEAKER_05]: This, yeah, some people, there are people who call it DRP, but people just call it drunken robot pornography because that's its name.

990
01:15:57,677 --> 01:16:02,721
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, you play Ruben, a bar owner who gave his robot bartender Tim's sentence.

991
01:16:03,242 --> 01:16:15,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And after Tim listened to all the pages at the bar, he said the best way to cure humanity is, you know, suffers from widespread depression, was to build a 30-story tall robot to destroy it, or several of them.

992
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:25,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to save the city of Boston Sky from Tim and his robot centerfolds.

993
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:27,112
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly how it's described.

994
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: This game...

995
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:35,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun with it.

996
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me really motion sick.

997
01:16:37,142 --> 01:16:46,796
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, there were aspects of jumping flash in it and all kinds of running and gunning craziness and it was wonderful.

998
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:51,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you wear a robot suit and you go around and you fight other robots.

999
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:55,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1000
01:16:57,115 --> 01:17:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The Digibond Games also did one in 2008 called The Wonderful End of the World and one called A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.

1001
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:15,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about this game is that it was announced on April 1st, 2010 as an April Fool's joke, and it came out on February 19th, 2014.

1002
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:19,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, people gave it kind of mixed reviews.

1003
01:17:19,986 --> 01:17:21,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people didn't really care for it.

1004
01:17:21,869 --> 01:17:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this game was hilarious, and I had a lot of fun with it.

1005
01:17:24,613 --> 01:17:28,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I wasn't very good at it, I will freely admit that, but I had a lot of fun with it.

1006
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:32,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can still get it on Steam.

1007
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:33,805
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like...

1008
01:17:33,785 --> 01:17:57,548
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 bucks if you pay 30 you can get three copies and share them with friends so that's nice um but yeah you have jetpacks and guns and go around and and stop Tim and his uh and instead of that they burn down your bar how can you let that go but yeah it's also really pretty

1009
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:00,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But it has the best opening song ever.

1010
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:08,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a Kotaku quote that says, I'd play this game even if it wasn't called Drunken Robot Pornography.

1011
01:18:10,281 --> 01:18:18,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a really smart way to get more of your game, like offer the bulk sales thing, offer the Costco plan on your game.

1012
01:18:18,714 --> 01:18:25,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's really smart, especially if it's like multiplayer, like 30 bucks for you and two other people to get the game is actually a really smart marketing tactic.

1013
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and honestly, it looks like there's some other neat games that have come out since.

1014
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:48,971
[SPEAKER_05]: They've kind of fallen off of my radar for a while because they had done some pretty neat games and they're trying to sell sentient ice cream.

1015
01:18:49,211 --> 01:18:54,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this website template allows us to add food items to our page.

1016
01:18:54,256 --> 01:18:56,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a restaurant, but if we were, here's some of the things we might offer.

1017
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:58,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Bison-Bear combo.

1018
01:19:00,221 --> 01:19:01,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Natural dancers.

1019
01:19:01,943 --> 01:19:02,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1020
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:06,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew a guy in gaming podcasting that left to go sell ice cream.

1021
01:19:06,549 --> 01:19:07,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

1022
01:19:08,191 --> 01:19:15,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The people at DejaVon are very interesting people.

1023
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:16,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The website's actually pretty funny.

1024
01:19:16,762 --> 01:19:21,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just like also that they have a game called... Literally.

1025
01:19:22,477 --> 01:19:25,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say, as much as you talked about this game, I never played it myself.

1026
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:27,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I probably need to at some point.

1027
01:19:28,471 --> 01:19:31,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you should get the friend pack and share it with your friends.

1028
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:32,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you already have a copy, right?

1029
01:19:32,842 --> 01:19:33,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming you do.

1030
01:19:33,844 --> 01:19:34,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1031
01:19:35,148 --> 01:19:36,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then who do I share it with?

1032
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Alan would be an obvious choice.

1033
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:38,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1034
01:19:39,137 --> 01:19:40,300
[SPEAKER_06]: You want a copy of the game, Loki?

1035
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:42,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably already have one.

1036
01:19:43,721 --> 01:19:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1037
01:19:44,523 --> 01:19:47,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we sure it wasn't in like a... Ooh, it's angry.

1038
01:19:47,748 --> 01:19:48,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like the little captions.

1039
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:50,231
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR giveaway!

1040
01:19:52,595 --> 01:19:57,723
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a copy, but I'm okay.

1041
01:19:58,124 --> 01:20:02,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just throw it in the pile anyways if I had a copy.

1042
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1043
01:20:03,151 --> 01:20:05,595
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd have to put this in Minecraft in order for you to play it, right?

1044
01:20:06,841 --> 01:20:08,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nope, I took it back.

1045
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:10,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it already.

1046
01:20:10,226 --> 01:20:10,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, funny.

1047
01:20:11,147 --> 01:20:12,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have it, yeah.

1048
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:13,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny, funny.

1049
01:20:13,089 --> 01:20:13,390
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1050
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that everything then?

1051
01:20:16,654 --> 01:20:17,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's it.

1052
01:20:18,056 --> 01:20:23,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we could hear some of the opening song, but... We might be able to, actually.

1053
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:24,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it in the beginning of this video?

1054
01:20:25,306 --> 01:20:26,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the very beginning, yeah.

1055
01:20:27,128 --> 01:20:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys won't hear it on Discord, but I'm going to play a little bit.

1056
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:33,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Just be quiet for me for a moment, and I will play some of it here for the listeners.

1057
01:20:35,056 --> 01:20:47,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the theme song to the game that DarkSakura was just speaking about.

1058
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it goes actually really long and this sadly gets cut off.

1059
01:20:52,677 --> 01:20:58,705
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to hear the rest, you'll just have to buy the game or look it up on YouTube, I guess.

1060
01:20:58,885 --> 01:20:59,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1061
01:21:00,447 --> 01:21:02,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunken Robot Pornography.

1062
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:08,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that this is another game that I've enjoyed that started off as an April Fool's joke.

1063
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:13,387
[SPEAKER_06]: We love April Fool's games that become real games.

1064
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:14,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Go is the one that comes to mind for me.

1065
01:21:16,451 --> 01:21:20,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's cover some other headlines in gaming rapidly in Rapid Fire News.

1066
01:21:20,097 --> 01:21:21,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Loki.

1067
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:30,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we got the final Crossworlds DLC promotion, or at least the franchise it's going to be with.

1068
01:21:30,913 --> 01:21:39,149
[SPEAKER_08]: This came from an early leaked copy of the game that was out there from retail, and it's Mega Man.

1069
01:21:39,470 --> 01:21:42,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, it was confirmed by Sonic City Net.

1070
01:21:42,255 --> 01:21:43,858
[SPEAKER_08]: They were the ones that posted the

1071
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:48,405
[SPEAKER_08]: The screenshot or the photo of the DLC brochure.

1072
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:51,049
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, Mega Man is going to be in there.

1073
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:59,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I think it was also confirmed on X as well by the official account showing that it's going to be, I think, Mega Man base.

1074
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:01,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Or no, Proto Man.

1075
01:22:02,107 --> 01:22:03,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Mega Man and Proto Man were in there.

1076
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:06,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I think possibly the racers that are going to be in there.

1077
01:22:06,734 --> 01:22:07,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm excited.

1078
01:22:07,936 --> 01:22:10,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make it Mega Man and Minecraft in one game.

1079
01:22:10,961 --> 01:22:12,122
[SPEAKER_08]: They're speaking my language.

1080
01:22:12,543 --> 01:22:16,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I will have to check this out when it comes out next week.

1081
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:25,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And then along with that, we're getting some more roster updates for the new Marvel Cosmic Invasion beat-em-up game.

1082
01:22:25,803 --> 01:22:32,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, of course, their latest trailer, they showed off Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider.

1083
01:22:32,354 --> 01:22:40,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the difference between Cosmic Ghost Rider and Ghost Rider is, but it is Ghost Rider.

1084
01:22:40,365 --> 01:22:41,347
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's got a space helmet.

1085
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:42,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he a motorcycle hero?

1086
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:44,611
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a space hero.

1087
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:47,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Space motorcycle, maybe?

1088
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:50,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1089
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:51,901
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Frank Castle, Brad.

1090
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:57,349
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I stopped reading any of the Ghost Rider stuff except for like Helverine.

1091
01:22:59,337 --> 01:23:00,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1092
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:03,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So the former Punisher is now Ghost Rider.

1093
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

1094
01:23:07,092 --> 01:23:07,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, Marvel!

1095
01:23:10,078 --> 01:23:12,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's go over to DarkSakura with a quick headline.

1096
01:23:14,592 --> 01:23:29,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Yas, so Sega has put out a trademark for Arcade Paradise and they have some unannounced games that they're going to reveal at Tokyo Game Show and this could be one of them or it could be a compilation.

1097
01:23:29,467 --> 01:23:31,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what it is, but they've got it.

1098
01:23:34,724 --> 01:23:35,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Exciting.

1099
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:38,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1100
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:39,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful, beautiful, exciting.

1101
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:47,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Less exciting is the news that some Evercade cartridges are moving into the Legacy program, which means they will no longer be made.

1102
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So they exist, but they are no longer being actively made.

1103
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:57,151
[SPEAKER_06]: As of December 2025, the four cartridges are the Pico Interactive Collection 2.

1104
01:23:57,993 --> 01:24:01,677
[SPEAKER_06]: This collection had Beast Ball, Eliminator Boat Duel, Hulk,

1105
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:05,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoops, Shut Up and Jam 1 and 2, Soccer Kids, Summer Challenge, Winter Challenge.

1106
01:24:05,723 --> 01:24:12,912
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of sports games, so maybe if that isn't your jam, you probably don't really care unless you're a collector about it.

1107
01:24:13,113 --> 01:24:16,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, this one kind of surprises me, the Indie Heroes Collection 1.

1108
01:24:16,858 --> 01:24:18,019
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of games in this.

1109
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:23,547
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 14 games, which is a lot for an EverQuest cartridge, which has a variety of different indie games.

1110
01:24:23,527 --> 01:24:47,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie Heroes Collection 1 Megacat Studios Collection 2 Alter Ego, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo and Julie Cat, and

1111
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:51,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I can't believe this is real life.

1112
01:24:53,015 --> 01:24:54,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yazi, Roniu's Tale.

1113
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:58,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest, not a lot of games I've recognized these names of, but cool.

1114
01:24:59,962 --> 01:25:03,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless, you know, the fact that if you don't already have this cartridge, you're probably going to have a hard time getting it.

1115
01:25:03,907 --> 01:25:06,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last one, the Sydney Hunter Collection.

1116
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:07,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard of these games.

1117
01:25:07,371 --> 01:25:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: There's three in this collection.

1118
01:25:08,872 --> 01:25:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a random game, throw them in there as well, called Jester.

1119
01:25:12,136 --> 01:25:15,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is all from Collector Vision Games.

1120
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So these four are now in Legacy status.

1121
01:25:18,623 --> 01:25:19,985
[SPEAKER_06]: and are no longer going to be available.

1122
01:25:20,085 --> 01:25:23,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Evercade is still cranking out new cartridges though.

1123
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:26,514
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some newer collections they just opened for pre-order.

1124
01:25:26,534 --> 01:25:29,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say a Rare collection is coming.

1125
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:37,729
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an Activision collection coming too, which actually kind of surprised me because that means Evercade and Microsoft have a deal because Microsoft is...

1126
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:47,659
[SPEAKER_06]: and Microsoft has their own retro thing, but they have an Activision collection coming, which I think sounds pretty cool because I think there might be some games in here that aren't in Microsoft's thing.

1127
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:50,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if the Microsoft thing had Star Master or Sky Jinx.

1128
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:51,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It might.

1129
01:25:51,502 --> 01:25:55,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have them all memorized and they do a terrible job of updating us when they have new stuff.

1130
01:25:56,127 --> 01:25:59,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Neo Geo Arcade 2, 3 is coming out soon.

1131
01:26:00,391 --> 01:26:01,812
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a lot of stuff on the horizon.

1132
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:03,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So Evercade's far from dead.

1133
01:26:03,794 --> 01:26:07,598
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it seems like it's growing, but those four cartridges will no longer be available.

1134
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:17,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some newer games that are coming out this week in world release dates.

01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,628

01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:16,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Rezlorania and the Red Alchemist and the White Guardian.

1161
01:28:16,478 --> 01:28:17,199

[SPEAKER_08]: That is a pretty big one.

1167
01:28:43,412 --> 01:28:46,718

[SPEAKER_06]: All right, heading over to Japan and checking out the releases there.

1171
01:29:06,282 --> 01:29:09,627
[SPEAKER_06]: EA Sports FC 26, of course, is releasing in Japan.

1172
01:29:09,647 --> 01:29:12,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I don't think there is a bigger video game in the world.

1173
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:14,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is on its way out.

1174
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:24,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the Switch 2, there's a variety of peripherals and things like new cases and things from third parties.

1175
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:25,913
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also have...

1176
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, that's next week.

1177
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:28,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that's it for Switch 2.

1178
01:29:28,542 --> 01:29:28,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1179
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:30,549
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the PlayStation 5?

1180
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:34,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill F, of course, is on its way out for the PlayStation 5, also in Japan.

1181
01:29:34,721 --> 01:29:37,911
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, Tigerclaw does not mean Silent Hill fucks.

1182
01:29:37,992 --> 01:29:42,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we, do we know the meaning behind the F or is that to be revealed through the story?

1183
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:43,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We might.

1184
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1185
01:29:44,142 --> 01:29:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1186
01:29:45,464 --> 01:29:51,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Also out on the PlayStation 5, Sonic Racing Crossworlds, which that is the game that Tigerclaw fucks with.

1187
01:29:51,573 --> 01:29:52,615
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that for a fact.

1188
01:29:52,735 --> 01:29:55,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I'll be fucking with it too.

1189
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to Sonic Racing Crossworlds because those games are pretty good.

1190
01:29:59,706 --> 01:30:03,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Mama Rukun Recurse is also out in Japan on the PS5 this week.

1191
01:30:03,872 --> 01:30:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Poppy Playtime Triple Pack.

1192
01:30:05,515 --> 01:30:08,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, gets its own release in Japan this week.

1193
01:30:08,539 --> 01:30:12,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Neon Blood, also releasing in Japan this week on the PlayStation 5.

1194
01:30:12,984 --> 01:30:21,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And Atelier Resloriana, the Red Alchemist and the White Guardian, which I think Loki also mentioned for the US, that is also out in Japan.

1195
01:30:21,234 --> 01:30:24,178
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks like a worldwide one this week.

1196
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Japan, of course, you can get the regular, you can get the premium box, and you can get the special collection box.

1197
01:30:32,448 --> 01:30:34,611
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in the special collection box?

1198
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:37,871
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch of crap.

1199
01:30:38,212 --> 01:30:39,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Stickers, postcards.

1200
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:41,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1201
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:42,383
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1202
01:30:42,764 --> 01:30:44,709
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look like one of the Paltrow's heads in this version.

1203
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:47,075
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to probably pre-order a different version for that.

1204
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:49,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold edition, I guess.

1205
01:30:50,032 --> 01:30:53,599
[SPEAKER_06]: EA Sports FC 26, of course, is on that console as well.

1206
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:58,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, they would probably release EA Sports FC 26 on the ZX Spectrum if they thought they'd sell 100 copies.

1207
01:31:00,311 --> 01:31:00,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1208
01:31:01,153 --> 01:31:05,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's about it for this week's releases, but still a pretty big week in releases.

1209
01:31:05,421 --> 01:31:08,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only going to get busier as the weeks continue.

1210
01:31:08,807 --> 01:31:09,829
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how about the U.K.?

1211
01:31:09,709 --> 01:31:09,829

[SPEAKER_05]: On the 26th, Freeride Switch, Clover Pit for PC, Hades 2 Digital for Switch 2.

1216
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:21,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, that says the 25th.

1217
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:37,208
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the 26th, FC26 for Switch and Switch 2, Atelier Reslariana, The Red Alchemist and The White Guardian, PS5, Switch PC on the 26th, Hotel Barcelona, Steam, Xbox, PS5,

1219
01:32:47,823 --> 01:32:48,724
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1220
01:32:48,744 --> 01:32:58,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get to the listener roundtable, your emails, your comments, your blue skeets, all that stuff, we will get to one more stories from Loki.

1221
01:32:58,217 --> 01:32:58,598
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1222
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:05,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unfortunately, we live in a world where people are... I mean, okay.

1223
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:06,469
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1224
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:14,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Making light of someone's death is not necessarily a good thing.

1225
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:17,957
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I think there's varying degrees of gray there.

1226
01:33:18,618 --> 01:33:24,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example, if I was making fun of the death of Hitler, that might be fine.

1227
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:32,440
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently one of those people was an artist at, of course...

1228
01:33:33,702 --> 01:33:52,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucker Punch, who got fired because of their comments regarding the death of Charlie Kirk and basically made a comment saying that, you know, something to, oh, I hope the shooter's name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back.

1229
01:33:54,024 --> 01:33:54,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that.

1230
01:33:55,657 --> 01:34:19,504
[SPEAKER_08]: um and then of course uh the artist Drew Harrison is no longer employed at Sucker Punch Productions because they were unhappy with his comments but there's also pressure from like external groups to try to get anybody fired for you know saying anything bad about the the mega MLK or was that 13th Apostle something like that that they want to call this hateful bigot of a person

1231
01:34:25,373 --> 01:34:26,395
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the world we live in.

1232
01:34:27,116 --> 01:34:29,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I have nothing to say on this.

1233
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:30,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's the world we live in.

1234
01:34:32,204 --> 01:34:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100Matt in chat says, anyone who says anything gets in trouble over this.

1235
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:37,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where we're at in this world.

1236
01:34:39,395 --> 01:34:41,138
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we'll just all sit and think.

1237
01:34:41,337 --> 01:34:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the Lister Roundtable and see what you all think.

1238
01:34:44,222 --> 01:34:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: You can send us emails.

1239
01:34:45,284 --> 01:34:48,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at OrangeLawnRadio.com You can send us posts.

1240
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:51,796
[SPEAKER_06]: BlueSky at OrangeLawnRadio, our domain.

1241
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:54,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, excuse me, OrangeLawnRadio.com or what have you.

1242
01:34:55,282 --> 01:34:58,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought somebody said they were going to send an email, but I didn't see any come in.

1243
01:34:58,127 --> 01:34:59,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we get an email, DarkSakura?

1244
01:35:00,355 --> 01:35:00,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1245
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:04,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, perhaps we just didn't.

1246
01:35:04,822 --> 01:35:07,947
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I'm going to make a statement real quick.

1247
01:35:07,967 --> 01:35:08,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1248
01:35:08,748 --> 01:35:19,765
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing about not speaking ill of the dead, don't make fun of death and murder, definitely, but it's not speaking ill of the dead if you're speaking the truth.

1249
01:35:23,963 --> 01:35:28,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people laugh at funerals because that's the only way they know how to process.

1250
01:35:28,587 --> 01:35:34,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pointing to a famous Mary Tyler Moore episode that I think explained a lot of these feelings that people have.

1251
01:35:34,893 --> 01:35:47,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's the same situation, but I am saying you have full license to when I pass away inevitably, which all humans do at some point, you have full license to roast me because I love a good roast.

1252
01:35:47,964 --> 01:35:50,146
[SPEAKER_06]: So please make it funny.

1253
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:51,207
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I ask.

1254
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:53,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make sure it's actually funny because there's a lot of jokes out there.

1255
01:35:53,849 --> 01:36:12,313
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1256
01:36:12,293 --> 01:36:23,209
[SPEAKER_08]: They are not responsible for any of this and blaming the complete other side, which has only talked about like, you know, hey, we need to be peaceful about this and all this stuff while they're still stoking things.

1257
01:36:23,229 --> 01:36:25,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just today, still stoking things.

1258
01:36:25,853 --> 01:36:27,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just ridiculous.

1259
01:36:27,355 --> 01:36:29,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It's disingenuous, obviously.

1260
01:36:29,278 --> 01:36:35,888
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to create a bigger rift because they know that when the chaos dies down, they'll come out on top.

1261
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:41,998
[SPEAKER_06]: and Chaos is getting people to not talk about the Epstein files as well.

1262
01:36:42,018 --> 01:36:46,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, you know... Oh, I'm not shutting up about that.

1263
01:36:46,904 --> 01:36:52,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think it's also... Oh, what else was I going to say this?

1264
01:36:52,993 --> 01:36:54,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I just lost the train of thought.

1265
01:36:54,354 --> 01:36:55,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what I was going to say.

1266
01:36:55,957 --> 01:37:00,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say that, yeah, yeah, of course we should denounce gun violence.

1267
01:37:00,403 --> 01:37:01,804
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terrible.

1268
01:37:02,225 --> 01:37:03,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1269
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:25,247
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of us that have been denouncing-

1270
01:37:25,227 --> 01:37:48,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, they're not gonna-

1271
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So I laughed at the irony.

1272
01:37:50,983 --> 01:37:52,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that.

1273
01:37:52,385 --> 01:37:58,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I think many of us are ready to talk about how do we fix the gun problem in this country.

1274
01:37:58,574 --> 01:38:02,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how we fix the country, but I can't say it.

1275
01:38:02,999 --> 01:38:03,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1276
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, I'm not talking about violence.

1277
01:38:05,863 --> 01:38:10,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I am talking about dismantling and reorganizing, but that's just me.

1278
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Due process.

1279
01:38:12,973 --> 01:38:13,293
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1280
01:38:14,595 --> 01:38:14,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1281
01:38:16,122 --> 01:38:22,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have emails, but if you want to send us an email for our future week, participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send us emails.

1282
01:38:23,232 --> 01:38:24,333
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you have for dinner, Rob?

1283
01:38:24,493 --> 01:38:25,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The Blue Skies.

1284
01:38:25,575 --> 01:38:28,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I haven't eaten dinner yet.

1285
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:29,099
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1286
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:30,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got lunch.

1287
01:38:30,621 --> 01:38:31,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I always eat dinner after the show.

1288
01:38:32,003 --> 01:38:32,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I never eat dinner before.

1289
01:38:35,708 --> 01:38:42,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Sundays are usually the day that Alan and I all do a DoorDash, which, yes, is expensive and we spoil ourselves.

1290
01:38:42,838 --> 01:38:44,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I DoorDash Starbucks.

1291
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:44,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even.

1292
01:38:45,381 --> 01:38:46,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not judging.

1293
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:52,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also, because my husband is a Costco queen, he found that you can get like $100 worth of DoorDash cards for $90.

1294
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:56,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we kind of filled up on the DoorDash cards there.

1295
01:38:57,215 --> 01:39:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you now the DoorDashians?

1296
01:39:00,578 --> 01:39:00,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop.

1297
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:02,781
[SPEAKER_06]: We DoorDashed ourselves.

1298
01:39:03,081 --> 01:39:09,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say it because they didn't pay me to endorse them, but one of those make your own pizza places, right?

1299
01:39:09,989 --> 01:39:10,750
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like...

1300
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:14,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I love balsamic.

1301
01:39:14,594 --> 01:39:29,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1302
01:39:29,208 --> 01:39:40,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

1303
01:39:40,835 --> 01:39:41,778
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you have?

1304
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:54,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is the original studio now I had a togo sandwich I haven't had a togo sandwich in forever They keep closing them Yeah, the one by me closed Yeah

1305
01:39:55,955 --> 01:40:00,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I did want to mention any Blue Sky mentions that we have.

1306
01:40:00,902 --> 01:40:07,712
[SPEAKER_06]: The only mention on our Blue Sky was actually a shout out from our friends over at GameBooey.org video game podcast.

1307
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:12,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I mentioned it last week that I'd recorded the episode, but it came out this week.

1308
01:40:12,258 --> 01:40:14,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I will shout out our pals over at GameBooey.org.

1309
01:40:15,363 --> 01:40:21,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I joined them to talk about music games and rhythm games because I had joined them for a show like 12 years ago.

1310
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: and they are revisiting some of their old topics through like the new lens.

1311
01:40:24,496 --> 01:40:26,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really interesting look back.

1312
01:40:26,379 --> 01:40:37,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's episode, you want to look for episode 182B but I would encourage you to listen to 182A and other selections from the Game Buoy catalog as well because Game Buoy is an excellent show.

1313
01:40:38,697 --> 01:40:48,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike and Slag Kick are extremely well-spoken individuals and really do their homework when it comes to the, more than I do, when it comes to the gaming news.

1314
01:40:48,732 --> 01:40:50,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So shout out for GameBuoy.org.

1315
01:40:50,866 --> 01:40:59,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny, every so often, Psychic and I consider going back to that old WoW comic that we wanted to do ages and ages ago.

1316
01:40:59,395 --> 01:40:59,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1317
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Hillsbrad Blues.

1318
01:41:02,164 --> 01:41:02,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1319
01:41:02,866 --> 01:41:03,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun.

1320
01:41:04,163 --> 01:41:06,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta get all the models again.

1321
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:08,309
[SPEAKER_06]: You know where Slykick's name comes from too?

1322
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:09,731
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an interesting story to tell.

1323
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:15,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So Slykick, that name comes from the God Warrior lady on, what was it?

1324
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Swapping Wives or whatever that show was called on Fox years ago where she goes, it's tainted.

1325
01:41:21,147 --> 01:41:21,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want it.

1326
01:41:21,928 --> 01:41:22,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark-sided.

1327
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:24,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Slykicks.

1328
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:26,394
[SPEAKER_06]: She's trying to say psychics, but she says Slykick.

1329
01:41:26,434 --> 01:41:30,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where he gets his name from is that whole thing.

1330
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it had to do with the...

1331
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1332
01:41:35,461 --> 01:41:38,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Condescending calling someone a slag.

1333
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:46,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a double entendre, in which case I fully endorse, because I do like to joke, you know, oh, I'm going on with the slag, right?

1334
01:41:48,306 --> 01:42:02,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, because there was an excellent show called Slag Wars that starred the cock destroyers, which sadly, you know, one of them passed away a couple of years ago, which was really, and they had a fight and all this stuff.

1335
01:42:02,122 --> 01:42:02,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1336
01:42:03,023 --> 01:42:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Slag Wars is hilarious.

1337
01:42:05,005 --> 01:42:05,606
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's great.

1338
01:42:05,626 --> 01:42:05,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1339
01:42:05,926 --> 01:42:07,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you remember the Cock Destroyers?

1340
01:42:07,928 --> 01:42:10,350
[SPEAKER_06]: They did all those YouTubes and stuff.

1341
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:11,731
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

1342
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these two gals that just talk really dirty.

1343
01:42:15,634 --> 01:42:21,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over-the-top funny to me, but they actually had a reality TV show to find the world's next biggest slag.

1344
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:25,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It was dumb reality TV.

1345
01:42:26,384 --> 01:42:28,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Reality TV ought to be a little stupid.

1346
01:42:28,806 --> 01:42:33,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I love The Traitors, because it's ridiculously over-the-top.

1347
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:34,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I thinking...

1348
01:42:34,951 --> 01:42:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: is one of the most incredible reality show hosts we've ever had because he brings that right, unserious vibe to what otherwise is actually, like, people really get into that game.

1349
01:42:47,253 --> 01:42:57,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But, like, the vibe of the show and the over-the-topness and kind of leaning into the excessiveness I think is what makes that show really fun at the end of the day.

1350
01:42:57,612 --> 01:42:59,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, yeah, anyway.

1351
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:04,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking of that line from Golden Girls.

1352
01:43:05,919 --> 01:43:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: She's not a slut.

1353
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,282
[SPEAKER_05]: She is the slut.

1354
01:43:08,302 --> 01:43:10,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't finish my thought on Slykick's name though.

1355
01:43:10,345 --> 01:43:15,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So that lady, no, that lady from Wife Swap or whatever it was, Marguerite Perrin was her name.

1356
01:43:15,533 --> 01:43:18,777
[SPEAKER_06]: She's kind of back because of TikTok.

1357
01:43:18,797 --> 01:43:20,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So she does a bunch of stuff.

1358
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing about her.

1359
01:43:22,663 --> 01:43:24,886
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, she's gone through some terrible loss.

1360
01:43:25,046 --> 01:43:28,431
[SPEAKER_06]: She lost her daughter and her husband, I think.

1361
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:52,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1362
01:43:52,964 --> 01:44:06,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it has something to do with the fact, I don't know all the details, they would be her words, not mine, but the fact that they were kind of there for her when she needed people to lean on through all the tragedy she was going through.

1363
01:44:06,256 --> 01:44:19,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a really, like she's become one of those like good religious people, the people that actually use their religion to lift up others, to do that sort of thing, as opposed to try to tear people down.

1364
01:44:19,468 --> 01:44:22,971
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just love that for her and her journey.

1365
01:44:22,951 --> 01:44:48,705
[SPEAKER_06]: and all that so look her up she's she's fun so um anyway i guess that's i guess that's it for me i'll i'll end on the god warrior note why not so uh sure let me uh let me go to loki though i do want to see if there's any other last minute stories from loki um not really much in the last minute stories other than um

1366
01:44:48,871 --> 01:44:57,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Still more stuff kind of falling out from that whole Visa MasterCard thing where adult games are kind of getting struck on there.

1367
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:07,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're not allowed to make updates to their game post-launch to add Not Safe for Work content to their game.

1368
01:45:08,992 --> 01:45:10,234
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently that's a new thing.

1369
01:45:10,254 --> 01:45:12,476
[SPEAKER_08]: They said Valve isn't the problem here.

1370
01:45:12,496 --> 01:45:14,338
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still the card processors.

1371
01:45:15,972 --> 01:45:18,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for bubbling that up.

1372
01:45:18,339 --> 01:45:20,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard on that in a while.

1373
01:45:20,324 --> 01:45:22,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, that's still a debate going on for sure.

1374
01:45:22,471 --> 01:45:24,115
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want that to fall off the radar.

1375
01:45:25,459 --> 01:45:26,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, still going.

1376
01:45:26,723 --> 01:45:29,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't let all the other news in the world distract you.

1377
01:45:30,215 --> 01:45:32,177
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have enough.

1378
01:45:32,738 --> 01:45:35,662
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1379
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:38,926
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be back next week in seven days to do it all over again.

1380
01:45:39,326 --> 01:45:43,432
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, we hope to see you here live with us at the Voice Geeks Network as we tape our show.

1381
01:45:43,932 --> 01:45:52,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do appreciate those of you that leave a nice review for our show and help us spread the word on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever it is that you found this show.

1382
01:45:53,464 --> 01:45:56,408
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, let's get to some final thoughts.

1383
01:45:56,388 --> 01:45:57,650
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

1384
01:45:58,150 --> 01:46:03,798
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned earlier you're going to do some Palio tonight, but do you have a final thought and wrap up for us?

1385
01:46:05,701 --> 01:46:08,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Resist the regime.

1386
01:46:08,345 --> 01:46:08,685
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1387
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:10,407
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, we'll see you next time, DarkSakura.

1388
01:46:11,509 --> 01:46:13,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Later, taters.

1389
01:46:13,171 --> 01:46:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1390
01:46:13,692 --> 01:46:15,675
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go over to you, Loki.

1391
01:46:15,695 --> 01:46:17,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1392
01:46:17,937 --> 01:46:21,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm excited to see we have Minecraft live this next week.

1393
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:30,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm curious to see what announcements are going to be made other than the date for the new update, which should be like probably next week or two.

1394
01:46:30,975 --> 01:46:32,419
[SPEAKER_08]: They're already in pre-release.

1395
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:38,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my final thought would be that we're starting to get into a really exciting game release period.

1396
01:46:38,198 --> 01:46:41,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this week I'm excited for the Sonic Cross Worlds racing.

1398
01:46:44,929 --> 01:46:49,516
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be in October, and that means Pokemon Legends, probably the game I've been looking forward to most this year.

01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:55,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to say because Metroid Prime 4 I'm really excited about as well.

1402
01:46:55,045 --> 01:46:58,491
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just a lot of good shit and gaming coming out in the next few weeks.

01:46:58,471 --> 01:47:26,993
