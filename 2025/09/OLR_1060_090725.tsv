9599	13788	I loved the audio-reactive design of Luminous and thought for years that Tetris would benefit from it.
13808	15912	Tetris Effect fulfilled those dreams and more.
16032	18377	It was nothing less than stunning for that and other reasons.
18517	25752	I'm happy with Tetris Effect alone, but now the design improvements that went into making Tetris Effect what it is get to come back to the originators in the form of Luminous Arise.
25732	27914	I was never good at Luminous, but I was never good at Tetris either.
28075	29356	I sure look forward to playing them anyway.
29656	35343	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35523	39207	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39247	45514	Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45594	47837	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
47857	48718	We're back.
48698	68057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
68037	71683	Not here tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
71823	77612	Bummer, bummer that they weren't able to make tonight's show, but there is some sort of private pinball event happening.
77652	81177	It's not a public thing, but it's a private pinball event that she had to make an appearance at.
81197	82599	So she is not here with us tonight.
83160	86185	So it is myself and Techmaster Loki holding down the fort.
86205	86666	Hey, Loki.
87407	87687	Hello.
87887	89350	How are you doing?
89370	89790	Pretty good.
90211	91513	How did you enjoy your week off?
92388	95760	It was pretty good, just been working on Minecraft stuff.
95921	98089	Yeah, I was going to say, did you get some Minecraft streaming in?
98109	103208	Sometimes when we're not here, he takes some streaming from the Channel 64 realm and all that.
103576	104117	I can't remember.
104137	106260	I think I did because I was testing.
107502	118018	I had to switch over to Vanilla OBS instead of Streamlabs OBS because I should have switched off of them a long time ago when they were bad business practices and stuff.
118038	120843	But, you know, it takes a while to just recreate all your scenes and everything.
121143	123226	I'm sure it's probably an easy way to import stuff.
123306	126371	But I had to switch off of Streamlabs because it was broken.
126491	130157	And so I did stream after that.
130137	140552	a little bit of the datapack minigame thing that I've made that I've been actually still working on this week and I think last week.
141848	144453	Never a dull moment in Loki content creation world.
145214	146276	Never a dull moment.
146717	150844	The only dull moment are my stats in YouTube.
150984	155753	With all the no people watching.
155913	163266	So not only are they not pushing the channel very hard, they're also actively restricting a few of my videos for no reason.
163246	184630	so like you know like if you make like a community guidelines you know faux pas and they're like oh hey this is inappropriate or you know we're gonna suppress this or whatever the least normally show that in your video like it'll flag it or something like that but now the new thing or not even new things they did this a while back too they will just at random
184610	189956	If Restricted View is on, they will suppress a video from that view.
190236	191938	They won't tell you that they've done it.
191958	193399	They won't tell you why they've done it.
195602	196403	It just disappears.
196723	206033	And so you have to dig deep within their help resources to find the form to say, hey, your stupid AI was being stupid.
206073	207895	There's nothing inappropriate here.
207915	210077	Please have a human look at this.
210057	233044	and then they'll do that.
233024	235749	and plenty more shows, great shows like British Invaders.
235809	239775	Shout out to Brian, who I saw at DragonCon and Anime Jam Sessions.
239795	243221	Shout out to the team over there, including Ranma, Ari and all the folks that work hard over there.
243882	246907	You can check out all that at vognetwork.com.
246927	249632	Okay, now that I said that, where was I going with that?
251587	252889	I was giving out the whole spiel in my mind.
252909	254131	I forgot where I was driving with that.
254571	254892	Shoot.
256234	258377	You've been hearing about stuff with YouTube, yes.
258397	259398	I was saying in the chat, yes.
259458	261781	And in the Discord server, I've been hearing about this AI stuff.
261801	267429	There's been a lot of posts about how AI is really messing with the YouTube content creators.
267529	271255	Even down to it's enhancing video when people don't want it to.
271835	273698	That's so dumb to me.
273738	274599	That is annoying.
274719	276582	Who decided that was a good idea?
276562	281250	Who thinks that an artist wants someone else to control their art?
282171	285396	That should be like 101 basic understanding of the internet.
286118	287320	Artists want control of their art.
288041	288542	They do that.
288622	290745	They also auto-dub things.
290926	295293	So they'll actually take the sound out of your thing and re-dub it into another language.
297036	299379	And so here's the bad part about that.
299460	302765	It's not like they're A.I.
302745	302805	's.
302785	310335	Subtitle generation that they use or their text-to-speech stuff, it doesn't work a lot of the times.
310616	311557	It's not accurate.
311717	315643	In fact, I was going through some of those videos that were suppressed.
315663	323814	I was like, well, maybe the text-to-speech misinterpreted something I said as something that's inappropriate or offensive.
324215	325256	Naughty word!
325456	331645	It's just screwed up a lot of other things, and so you have to go in there and fix all your subtitles.
331625	332727	I don't know.
332907	337714	There's not a lot of people that watch my content with subtitles on, but I probably should go back and fix those.
338235	345746	Once again, not getting views on anything, so really hard to motivate myself to do extra work for something that's not going to get views.
346727	361429	But yeah, basically, even just outside my content, there's been large creators that have noticed a downtick in their viewership, and it could be because some of the stuff that has to do with the AI
361409	366537	Age Estimation, or determining if your platform is AI.
366878	369342	It's just dumb.
369723	377275	There's so many dumb things that they do to refuse to try to pay somebody for their content.
377423	390086	Yeah, so anyways, outside of any sort of paid promotions, the channel has been basically flat to negative for the last several years.
390106	390827	Well, I'm sorry to hear it.
390927	394333	I hope it comes through for you someday, Loki.
394393	400444	Don't take it as a sign of quality, because I'm sure there's a lot of creators out there who do good stuff that just have a hard time
400610	402352	Punchin' Through, and it's just going to take that one.
403833	407137	Going to our chat again, where I was going earlier, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
407177	409720	Here's a random comment, but I want to bring it up because it's funny.
409740	414365	QuestBuster says, is that Cowboys of Moo Mesa by Konami behind Loki?
414405	415166	It sure is.
415586	416427	And even I had it.
416607	418129	I was like, is that Sunset Riders?
418269	419270	Oh, no, that's cows.
419991	421773	That's a great game.
423455	424275	That's a fun one.
424816	426718	That's one they need to bring back.
427103	438242	If they can bring back Battletoads after all these years, and if Konami's in this mood to reboot all of their old IPs, you know, if we're gonna get- Just, like, have a whole, like, beat-em-up, like, collection.
438262	439083	Let's do- Wait a minute.
439604	440145	I'm sorry.
440225	446776	Tigerclaw says Cowboys of Mumei says getting a reboot- Oh, the animated series is based on- Oh, I forgot it was based on an animated series.
446796	448239	I got excited for a minute.
448299	449601	I was like, what?
449301	449601	!
450391	468535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
468515	472220	And then they were on a different type of fire in the early 2000s.
473141	473662	Dumpsters.
474203	477167	I want to get to some comments about the AI thing, too.
477567	484817	TigerClaw says, Some YouTube shorts that do the retro video style were getting AI enhanced and looking like crap.
484837	486760	See, that's so...
486740	492508	I get it because what little content I've posted to YouTube is usually around retro games.
492528	497635	I don't have illusions of being a big content creator on there and making a penny.
497655	503403	But yeah, I'd be pissed if AI was wrecking the retro games because that's the point.
503423	504184	It's retro.
504544	508910	And there's so much retro content on YouTube as well that I just can't believe.
509291	510492	Just make it an option.
510672	511093	Yeah.
511073	512837	I don't see a point to automatically do it.
512897	514982	They always do that with YouTube stuff.
515002	519773	They're like, make it an option that we can opt into and not like, here, we're going to force it down your throat.
519953	521517	Yeah, there's beauty filters.
521817	523862	There's beauty filters on Snapchat.
524143	526247	There's Instagram filters that change.
526288	528272	And if you want to have that,
528252	530217	AI enhanced stuff, then fine.
530237	531240	Just let it be a filter.
531260	532222	That's what it is, right?
532242	532804	It's a filter.
533245	534869	So let it be a filter, a choice.
535230	536313	Some people will use it.
536333	539862	Some people use that beauty filter stuff, even though it looks fucking horrible and fake.
539882	543291	But hey, it helps some people.
543912	546074	Push the post button, so fine.
546134	546475	Whatever.
546615	549498	Let's see, other comments as well.
551560	557386	Jason, our friendly voiceover guy here at Orange Launch Radio, says, AI is an awful sandwich right now.
557726	558967	The producers want to push it.
559327	563372	Too many people trust them too much, and we squeezed in the middle that know better.
563872	566054	Not that this is at all specific to AI.
566154	568076	Oh yeah, this is how the world works sometimes.
568357	571860	Well, and the thing with AI, you know...
571840	588634	and DarkSakura.com.
588614	610048	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
610028	635952	but that vendor showed up the next day and started selling the stuff that looked suspiciously AI and obviously they had to do some investigation into it and Monday they figured out what was going on and they asked that guy to leave and he said no and that's why you now see the screens with the police in there which the police were not called to shut down AI selling AI art is not illegal
635932	644944	Selling AI art in a place called Artist Alley is shitty, and it's a breach of contract with DragonCon, but it's not illegal.
645425	655619	But the problem was, it was that breach of contract with DragonCon, because DragonCon has a contract that says, thou shalt not use AI art and sell it, or sell AI-generated art that you did on Midjourney or whatever.
655639	663990	Or really, what it also really says is, thou shalt not completely misrepresent yourself in what you're presenting and all this stuff.
664010	665432	So...
665412	683117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
683097	709206	AI should not be sold in a place called Artist Alley.
709523	710465	Period.
711366	717858	If you want to buy AI prints, if you want to do that, I don't understand it, but it's your right.
718138	722626	If you want to tattoo AI art on your buttocks, that is your right.
722787	724470	Go forth and tattoo.
725151	729118	I'm going to laugh at it, and I think a lot of people will too, but you have every right.
730803	748069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
748049	755757	When you just throw something like Mid Journey or whatever in that, it's a disaster and shouldn't be sold there.
755777	760382	And now what's interesting is just seeing a lot of conventions follow suit was the interesting thing that came out of that.
760402	763105	Anyway, that is one very small part of what happened.
763125	765087	I didn't even see any of that, for the record.
765187	768891	I was on the floor below when that all went down.
768952	774057	I was actually in the vendor hall on Monday, but I never got higher than the third floor because I was running out to do something else.
774037	796399	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
796379	800147	This AI thing, I think, is really going to come to a head with copyright.
800407	807702	I really think the copyright and trademark issues and the stuff that Disney is starting to bring up and who's the other player in this?
807762	808885	Warner Brothers?
808905	809686	Warner Brothers.
809706	811350	I think there's even more than that.
811710	812532	Universal.
812512	841573	so all these companies that are now suing that's where this is going to come to a head because I'm sorry like the fact that you can go to those vendors or vendors you can go to the sites online and type you know Shrek or whatever or Green Ogre from a movie and it just basically produces Shrek and like it's a very cut like Disney is very protective of their copyright so much so that they have lobbied to have copyright law changed in their favor hence why Mickey Mouse from Steamboat Willie is
841553	847502	and only Steamboat Willie went public domain a couple years ago and maybe a couple other cartoons since then.
849265	850587	Why that got extended forever and ever.
850907	854032	Disney and all these other companies too have that weight.
854052	856957	They're gonna get this AI shit changed.
857858	859340	That's the reality of the situation.
859360	861584	It's just, you know, the legal system is slow as fuck.
861604	863106	It's gonna take a while to play out.
863727	871097	Yeah, Rinmari in chat says, I don't like megacores, but it feels like they are our best bet at stopping AI-generated art.
871698	874982	Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
876104	877205	That's what it is.
878206	884715	And SSJ100Matt says, maybe the good thing to come out of AI slop is copyright law getting re-examined.
884735	884835	Yeah.
884855	885676	Absolutely.
885696	885917	100%.
886297	888420	It will benefit.
888440	889161	I don't know.
889445	898055	And I still believe, and maybe some of you are still going to disagree with me, and that's fine, that there are some things that AI does that isn't necessarily terrible.
898075	901939	But when I talk about that, I am not talking about the generative AI and that type of stuff.
901959	903802	I'm usually talking about the types of tools.
904062	906705	We are not going to get to 8K arts and games.
906725	911250	We're not going to get to more without what some would call AI.
911991	918118	Because AI has been around since Pong on the Atari 2600 and before that.
919229	923503	So it's just, you gotta kind of conceptualize what do we mean when we talk about AI?
923703	928138	And most people are talking about this generative AI slop stuff and yeah, that's gotta go.
928539	930184	But some of this other stuff,
930535	952442	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
952422	956145	Although, this was a very slow week for video games, to be honest.
957907	960429	Except one big, big game did come out, right, Loki?
960929	964633	So what happens when you have a slow week in games and then one big game comes out?
964713	976603	When the game that's been hyped up forever... Yeah, so, of course, Hollow Knight Silksong released this week, and it was so popular that it crashed lots of these different storefronts.
976623	979706	So Xbox, Switch, I know Steam had issues.
980266	981467	So...
981447	1007117	that was kind of fun I guess but yeah it's popular yeah and um you know I think it's I don't remember how much it's sold already but I know it hit some it was getting some pretty high numbers as far as the concurrent players and stuff like that on Steam but yeah I'm sure all of that stuff's a result now it's just that initial kind of rush to get it right away yeah
1008059	1018721	I'm very curious how... I've got to be honest, and I've got to open this up to chat, because I'm not super familiar with Silksong and this stuff.
1018761	1021106	I'm not familiar with the games.
1021126	1023090	I know they are Metroidvanias, I know they're pretty popular.
1023110	1024894	I know they're on Game Pass, so I'm probably going to check it out.
1024914	1025736	At least the second one is.
1025776	1027840	I'm assuming the first one is on Game Pass as well.
1027820	1053658	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1053638	1059305	So interesting, because of maybe all of this hype, we have people that are jumping directly to the sequel.
1059385	1060646	Not that that hasn't happened before.
1060686	1061387	I think there's a lot of people.
1061407	1066634	I mean, I think most people started Grand Theft Auto probably on three, if not a later game.
1066654	1069898	I think very few people probably played the first two Grand Theft Auto games.
1069918	1070718	They were very different.
1071580	1074503	Dr. C in chat says, my wife picked it up ASAP.
1074523	1076485	It's all her jam.
1076566	1079449	Mike Def says, I've only played a bit of Hollow Knight.
1079529	1081992	I have it on Switch, but it's definitely hard.
1081972	1086999	Oh yeah, Dr. Sia brings up Street Fighter 2, another excellent example of getting in on that.
1087760	1089643	Rinmari in chat, I love this point too.
1090064	1096393	I feel like my interest in Metroidvania has dwindled after Castlevania Order of Ecclesia and La Mulana remake.
1096753	1101720	That's a really good point about how I think there's a lot of people that are really burned out on Metroidvania.
1101781	1103283	You say the same thing about roguelikes too.
1103303	1105125	I think that's another one that people are getting burned out on.
1105446	1107449	But Metroidvanias, I mean, and that's fair.
1107549	1108350	Those are two...
1108330	1134237	I love Metroid, I love Castlevania but I understand there's a lot of games out there that kind of take those formula and some of them are really incredible like I really liked Guacamelee was one that's kind of like that what was the game oh my god it's the beautiful game on Xbox they made two of them why can't I remember all of a sudden like I'm just lapsing today but you know those the really pretty art one
1136377	1137579	Somebody will shout it in chat.
1137720	1138681	Ori, thank you, thank you.
1138722	1139824	Ori, Ori in the Blind Forest.
1140745	1142369	The Wisdom Tree or whatever the second one was called.
1143811	1146797	Will Lewis or something like that.
1147058	1150124	Those games are great, even if I can't remember the name.
1150164	1151186	I did play them at one point.
1151206	1151707	They're great.
1152047	1156596	And then you have some Metroidvanias that you know, they're
1156964	1177285	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1177265	1181334	I'm going to, of course, bring up, it's not classic, but Turbo Kid.
1182797	1183839	Definitely check that out.
1183960	1184681	Okay, there you go.
1184721	1185162	Free plug.
1185884	1192037	Questbuster brings up, I tried Silksong, and I do love Metroidvanias, but it hasn't really hooked me, and that's completely fine.
1192118	1192519	No hate.
1192980	1194503	Absolutely happy for those enjoying it.
1194864	1195786	And that's okay.
1195946	1196387	Like,
1196367	1212199	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1212854	1238811	but okay like I can I can see the artistic merit in the game that makes it so well received trying to think of something recently that was like that for me see like I want to say Claire Obscure Expedition 33 but I actually really like that game like it's actually I'm like I'm right on board I understand the hype in that game that game's fucking incredible but you know there's other games where uh I kind of go all right if that's what you're into cool but just you know not for me
1238791	1244548	a lot of shooty bang bang games the Halos, the Call of Duties of the world not for me, this is what it is
1245592	1248756	Oh, actually, Rinmari brought up Monster Hunter.
1248976	1250018	That's a great example.
1250198	1252421	I cannot get into those Monster Hunter games.
1252441	1253282	I can't.
1253302	1253703	I've tried.
1253723	1254784	I've tried every single one.
1255044	1255846	I've tried to get into it.
1255986	1257548	It's just not a formula that works for me.
1257908	1259490	But I understand why people are into it.
1259590	1262915	I did like the mobile one, for what it's worth, which is still going.
1262935	1268662	I don't play it as much as I used to, but I like the Monster Hunter mobile game, but I cannot play the console games.
1268783	1269844	I just can't.
1269824	1272029	But that doesn't mean they're bad.
1272570	1276600	That just means it's not the flavor I will be ordering at the counter.
1276620	1279306	But I'm not going to try to get it removed from the store because I don't like it.
1280028	1282433	So, you know, it is what it is.
1282801	1292474	Anyway, okay, since we, I think there's not a lot else to say on Silksong, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week.
1292494	1293596	So Loki, why don't we go to you?
1293676	1294337	How was your gaming week?
1295158	1297441	Well, I've been just playing Minecraft.
1297642	1299624	A lot of it's been just kind of going through.
1299725	1303049	So I think I put out an episode last week.
1303630	1309879	It's been like two months because I've been working on this massive project in the SMP that I'm on.
1310439	1312302	And it's basically this dated project.
1312585	1313972	Datapack Driven,
1314442	1344111	Battle Arena game that has like you know all these custom mob waves at the fight and stuff like that so I've been working on we wrapped up our no sleep game finally so we had the finalist for that and then it's been just kind of redesigning some of the stuff to kind of take it beyond that no sleep game so I've added like another 10 waves to it a lot more music a lot of other enhancements on top of it and I think today I've been like going through just uh
1345053	1350768	BugTesting and Balancing for some of that before I put it up on the server for this week.
1351711	1356042	Just go through all that stuff and that's what I've been working on solidly for like
1357102	1380814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1380794	1397655	One of the
1397973	1426107	Hotter Garbage Hotter Garbage
1426087	1429633	It's entertaining hot coverage that you can maybe play the game through.
1430033	1431095	So I'm going to mess with that.
1431115	1432017	I think it'll be fun.
1432918	1434240	So stream some of that.
1434300	1437466	Stream some of the Slumber Dome 2.0 stuff.
1438587	1439669	And I don't know.
1439689	1440270	Whatever else.
1440711	1442053	Figure it out.
1443147	1444690	Um, let's see my gaming week.
1444870	1447977	Honestly, since I was out of town, I didn't play a lot.
1447997	1451043	I played, I'm still playing Final Fantasy XI, Loki.
1451063	1452386	The callback is so real.
1452626	1453167	It's so real.
1453187	1453969	I'm having so much fun.
1454069	1458157	I got my Red Mage up to 32, which is fun.
1458177	1461544	And now, now I'm kind of at that point where I need to make money to buy spells.
1461524	1482115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1482095	1485438	I don't usually talk about how much I play the mobile games too.
1485478	1488281	So like you probably go, oh my God, Rob just plays nothing but Final Fantasy XI.
1488361	1490883	True, but I also play a lot of the mobile games.
1490903	1494086	So I'm still going pretty hard on Pokemon Go.
1494266	1498010	Then I loaded up on Pokeballs when I was in downtown Atlanta.
1498490	1502254	And so I've been able to go on walks and just use my Bluetooth catcher to catch a ton of stuff.
1502274	1503335	Been working on quests.
1503635	1506218	They have a big XP event going on right now.
1506518	1511983	So I'm trying to push level 48 before they roll out the new levels because I don't think I'm getting all the way to 50.
1511963	1516130	My god, there's way too much XP needed to get to 50, but I'll probably get to level 48.
1516190	1519596	I only have about 2 million to go for that, and we'll see.
1519616	1522741	But yeah, they're rolling out up to level 80 cap in October.
1522761	1523683	I don't know if you heard about that.
1523803	1524144	Oh, wow.
1524204	1531356	Yeah, you're going to get to go even higher in Pokemon Go, and I don't know if they're rebalancing the levels or what, or if you're going to have to get...
1532011	1536897	Just an ungodly amount of experience points to even get to level 51.
1537458	1541383	But some people play that game a fucking ton, and it wouldn't surprise me.
1541403	1547971	But they've added all of these new mechanics between the Dynamax raids and routes and megas.
1548191	1552196	There's so much stuff that didn't exist when the game first did the 50 cap.
1552216	1556922	It's going to be interesting to see how they integrate that all into the new level cap that gets raised up.
1556902	1558543	So I do still play a lot of that.
1558563	1561006	And I play the classic GBS game.
1561046	1563088	I still play Ingress a lot.
1563168	1566070	I went out with some friends yesterday and did what we called Recursing.
1566471	1570034	So Recursing in the game is when you've hit the maximum level in Ingress.
1570054	1571495	You hit level 16.
1571535	1572916	That's as high as it goes.
1572936	1576640	And then you hit the little button that says Recurse, and poof, you're back to level 1.
1577360	1582365	And honestly, there isn't a lot of reason to do it besides status.
1582445	1584647	Did they ever add anything to the notes?
1584627	1585849	Actually, they did.
1586430	1588293	Just within the last two weeks.
1588813	1589815	But it's really lame.
1589835	1590536	You ready to hear it?
1591237	1595243	So now you have the ability to favorite keys in your inventory.
1595564	1598709	You have a star button and you can favorite keys in your inventory.
1598729	1600932	And then that way you can filter...
1600912	1617098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1617230	1623223	That feature would be 10 times better if it worked with keys that were in your lockers.
1623684	1630679	If I could favorite a key in my locker and still recharge it without taking it out, that would be a god mode feature for Ingress.
1630699	1634788	And I realize those of you that don't play the game have no fucking clue what I'm talking about, so I'm sorry about that.
1634808	1636572	But basically, let me just put...
1636552	1655623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1655603	1666193	But they are doing another feature where basically they're bringing what Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter have where you can scroll the map anywhere from your point of view.
1666353	1673559	You can look at the map like down the street to see like what monsters are over there in Manhunt or what flowers are blooming over there in Pikmin.
1673819	1676141	They're going to bring that to Ingress because why not?
1676162	1678884	You have an Intel map anyway, so you should be able to see everything in a game.
1679424	1681146	It is going to be a core feature though.
1681326	1682968	You have to pay for it to get that.
1683288	1685610	So anyway.
1685590	1687412	My friends and I did a recursion.
1687492	1692138	That is my fifth time going from one to 16 and then starting over.
1692218	1695483	But what we did, they had a double experience thing on Saturday.
1695523	1706837	So we had a big elaborate plan that we were going to throw a giant field and use what's called a battle beacon to just keep flipping the polarity of one of the anchors so we could re-throw this field over and over and over again.
1707158	1711523	And by the time, you know, it probably maybe took us three hours to farm all the keys and do what we needed to do.
1711904	1714467	And then at the end of it, we were all level eight again.
1714447	1729468	DarkSakura.com
1729448	1730269	So there you go.
1730369	1737217	If you think I talk about Final Fantasy XI too much, it's because I don't talk enough about how I really nerd the fuck out over these other games that I play.
1737577	1741342	But they're great for getting me outdoors and moving around and burning calories and all that shit.
1741722	1745306	But honestly, when I was at DragonCon, I barely touched Ingress.
1745326	1752975	I did a little Pokemon Go to keep spinning the stops at the hotel, but otherwise I kind of took a break from all that while I was at DragonCon.
1752955	1768129	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1768109	1786287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1786267	1803465	DragonCon, if you don't know
1803445	1819716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1819696	1835376	and what I mean is structurally you have like r slash star wars and not literally it's not literally a reddit convention but you have a room over here star wars stuff going on all the time a room over here star trek going on all the time you have a
1835356	1838680	A room over here, digital media and podcasting.
1838700	1840062	A room over here, video games.
1840403	1842506	A room over here, War College.
1842946	1848133	Those old fucking board games from the 70s with hexagons and shit that you move the pieces around.
1848414	1850717	That is going on all weekend long in one of the rooms.
1850737	1853060	They have esports.
1853180	1858487	It is like probably four city blocks downtown are taking up in some shape or form by this convention.
1858848	1860930	It's unreal in the size, but it's amazing.
1860950	1861331	It's incredible.
1861351	1861972	It's why I love it.
1862553	1864435	So...
1864415	1892128	DragonCon's beginning!
1892188	1893409	Welcome home!
1893389	1922468	DragonCon Rave Parties
1922448	1924741	to kick things off, basically.
1924802	1926210	So that's pretty cool.
1926753	1928020	Honestly...
1928405	1929526	There's so much going on at DragonCon.
1929626	1933992	I am honestly making plans next year to go in like on Saturday.
1934853	1935754	To go in that early.
1935774	1936715	I'm not going to stay at a hotel.
1936735	1937776	I'm going to stay with a friend.
1938277	1944444	But like to get some of my social time in before DragonCon begins because DragonCon is so busy.
1944464	1947588	There's so much going on at DragonCon that I don't even see.
1947808	1950771	You cannot see all of DragonCon your first year.
1950791	1951592	It's just not going to happen.
1951612	1952794	There's too much going on.
1952814	1953695	It's like Disneyland.
1953715	1957399	You have to pick the three rides you want to ride the most and everything else is a bonus.
1958746	1960228	Dark to see you in chat says funny.
1960268	1961950	I have an author who follows me on blue sky.
1962010	1963592	He writes LGBTQ fantasy.
1963893	1965334	He lives there and goes there every year.
1965475	1968799	Oh, the literary stuff at Dragon Con is huge.
1968819	1970761	And I barely touched that realm.
1970781	1972984	I just it's not around my super follow.
1973365	1985580	But if you are a literary fan, whether that's fantasy, whether that's young adult, whether that's actually dragon literature, which you know, the con could arguably have gotten its name from there, there, there is a place there's a track for that.
1986758	1987622	DragonCon.
1988105	1988668	That's my new saying.
1988708	1990075	Yep, there's a track for that.
1990356	1991160	There's a track for that.
1991200	1992567	Or there's a cult for that.
1992968	2022047	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2022027	2033307	Um, and then, uh, video gaming track we worked with for a while too, which also, which was that once, once upon a time was the MMO track where they talked about World of Warcraft and EverQuest primarily.
2033327	2039438	Uh, then it became the video gaming track a few years later and now it's one of the, probably one of the biggest attended tracks at con.
2039879	2040640	So there's that.
2041381	2042263	Um,
2042243	2048037	But as of last year, Bobby Blackwolf and I now volunteer with the main programming track.
2048057	2053290	So we have the fortune of moderating panels with some of the large guests that they bring into DragonCon.
2053310	2055516	So I got to do a few this year.
2056238	2058804	And let me talk about the non-gaming related ones first.
2058824	2060067	I'll talk about the gaming related ones.
2060047	2067758	So Friday, I had a panel with the cast of the ABC television show Once Upon a Time, some of the cast members from that show.
2068379	2070483	And I had a great time.
2070863	2072285	It was a very lovely conversation.
2072726	2077233	A question I often get is, well, how were the celebrities backstage?
2077253	2078254	How was talking to them?
2078294	2079696	How was getting to meet them and stuff?
2079716	2085565	And my honest answer to that is, I usually meet them about 60 seconds before we go on stage.
2085545	2087627	So there isn't a lot of time for interaction.
2087668	2096398	There is time for the professional exchange of if you don't want to answer a question, here's the signal to give me so I know to get in there and interject.
2096418	2101324	Because when you take live questions, I'm sure you all know things could have the potential of getting weird.
2101624	2102365	Thankfully, they don't.
2102485	2104708	They didn't during the weekend, but they have the potential.
2104748	2106490	So you always have to be ready for that.
2106470	2123567	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2123547	2144458	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2144438	2146982	Their time is very precious in making money.
2147122	2148904	So yeah, it is what it is.
2148924	2151308	But for the panel itself, we had some great questions.
2152169	2153972	It was fun to talk about that show.
2154092	2157857	A show I was not super familiar with, interestingly enough.
2158097	2165989	The way I was able to figure out what was going on on that show, I tried to reach out to some people who I'm like, I know they do a podcast on this show, but there's a lot going on.
2166049	2167471	I wasn't really able to get all the info.
2167811	2169113	But it turns out
2169920	2173784	My boss at work likes this show.
2173804	2174886	And it's kind of cool.
2174946	2177428	I used to keep this part of my life very private.
2178369	2182414	But I got a cool job now.
2182654	2184737	I'm a cool mom at a cool job, right?
2184817	2188381	So the people at my job are pretty supportive of these things I do outside of work.
2188441	2191484	And so my boss is genuinely – my boss might be listening, by the way.
2191544	2191885	Hi.
2192005	2192545	You know who you are.
2193887	2193987	Yeah.
2193967	2221543	and um she she takes an active interest in like oh what kind of panels do you get to do at DragonCon this year and so I told her that I had Once Upon a Time and she said I remember that show I watched that show and so she actually filled me in because I admittedly I had not seen the show I do my homework I do the research and I watched the pilot episode I watched another two random episodes just based on you know audience feedback and scores and stuff and I try to get familiar with the show and actually I will say now that I've watched the show I'm
2221523	2223285	I actually, I want to watch more.
2223405	2224406	It was really good.
2224486	2230992	Like, it's just that right amount of cheeseball, but being interestingly, interesting enough, where I really enjoyed it.
2231072	2232914	So I would watch more Once Upon a Time later.
2232934	2234315	I don't even remember much of it.
2234335	2238780	Like, I know I used to watch it when it first came out, but then it got, like, too much.
2239220	2245246	That's most of the feedback I've heard, is that it just became really fucking extra the last couple seasons.
2245646	2249370	But some of the guests we had were in season six.
2249350	2255078	So we actually had the actress that played Jasmine and Oded Fair, who played Jafar.
2255658	2259544	And it was kind of, I could tell he was like, I did three episodes of this show.
2259564	2260966	Why am I up here on this panel?
2261226	2265351	Like, not in a negative way, but I think just in a self-humorous sort of way.
2265372	2273022	Like, when he is probably most well-known for his role in the cinematic classic, The Mummy, that was also an Oded Fair thing.
2273422	2275425	So, but he's up there talking about...
2275405	2296536	Jafar being Jafar in three episodes um a lot of questions about the musical episode a lot of questions about the musical episode unfortunately Jasmine and Jafar weren't in that episode but it's my job as moderator what I try to do I'm I am an inclusive moderator so sometimes what I'll do is I'll you know say oh um you know Karen you weren't in the musical I know but what
2296516	2318845	What song do you think would have happened if Jasmine was in the musical?
2319162	2334842	which includes Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz who of course played you know he played a very popular character Angel on Buffy the Vampire Slayer but this is a panel about Bones so we you know we did that panel this was also an interesting panel because
2334822	2361775	it was going to be all fan Q&A then it was going to be an interview then it kind of landed being half and half and things change all the time you learn to roll with the punches so it was nice though that I got to like actually interview I love getting to kind of just do that and really like you know dig in and they were really good with the questions I felt felt it was fun there was a good energy in the room and I think people that were really into that show which again was a show I had to familiarize myself with but I did my did my homework I learned about it and it was
2361755	2362636	It was interesting.
2362897	2365260	I get why people were into that show.
2365280	2367043	The characters were very, very unique.
2367163	2369566	And I think people saw themselves in a lot of those characters.
2369987	2374313	So I think that is why that show was on for like 79 seasons on Fox.
2374333	2375234	It was on a very long time.
2376536	2377618	So we got to talk about that.
2378239	2381263	And yeah, the cast there was really nice.
2381363	2383446	I did get to shake David Boreanaz's hand.
2383506	2384067	Nice guy.
2384448	2385189	Emily Deschanel.
2385509	2386831	She wasn't really touching people.
2386851	2388133	I think she was a little bit...
2388113	2393860	Con Crudiverse, which I do not blame her or fault her for at all.
2394421	2396423	She would give a nice little friendly wave and hello.
2396463	2397605	She complimented my shirt.
2397785	2399026	Lovely, lovely gal.
2399046	2401469	Loved meeting her and working with her on the panel.
2401610	2402871	And yeah, it was great.
2402891	2403432	It was a great cast.
2403692	2404493	Just a lot of fun.
2404954	2409219	I love when the energy of the cast is they all get along and they have fun with it.
2409259	2411081	And that was what I was really feeling for the Bones panel.
2411101	2411722	So it was a lot of fun.
2412503	2414205	And then...
2414422	2416545	What else did I have that wasn't gaming related?
2416605	2420651	Did everything else I had was game related?
2420671	2421532	I'm thinking through in my head.
2422413	2423134	I'm missing something.
2423194	2424797	I'm completely forgetting a panel I had.
2425197	2426719	Star Wars!
2426739	2428662	I had a Star Wars panel on Sunday.
2429343	2430244	How could I forget?
2430765	2432548	It's because I had done one last year too.
2432588	2438556	No, the Star Wars panel I had on Sunday was great because John Boyega was on that panel.
2438536	2440878	There was a lot of people from The Mandalorian that were on that panel too.
2441379	2442640	And there has been chatter.
2442800	2443681	I'm just going to put this to rest.
2443741	2451489	There's been chatter on the internet about John Boyega kind of resents Star Wars at this point because his character was done dirty.
2451850	2453231	He doesn't like doing the appearance.
2453271	2454312	I'm sorry.
2454752	2459557	I don't know where y'all got that from because that was not my experience at DragonCon.
2459958	2461319	He ate that panel up.
2461419	2467125	He was telling stories about taking Harrison Ford out to dinner and he was talking about... Yeah, I've heard.
2467105	2497112	I heard about those, yeah.
2497092	2497853	on Sunday.
2497874	2510899	Honestly, like, I think back when the whole thing fell apart with Kang and, you know, the, I can't remember the actor's name now, that played Kang as well in the Marvel series.
2511059	2515708	Like, John Boyega should have replaced him, honestly, at that time, but...
2515773	2517917	Yeah, he's he was a delight.
2517997	2521003	He was I and you know, again, I don't get to meet them for very long.
2521364	2522646	Smile, shake hands.
2522927	2523608	How you doing?
2523668	2530220	How's it just very, like, you know, and this is Sunday, you would think by this point, they're all sick of being there really nothing like none of them.
2530281	2531343	I didn't get that vibe from any of them.
2531363	2534208	They were all very lovely people on that panel.
2534569	2536853	Okay, now let's get to gaming related stuff.
2536833	2542549	So Sunday morning, I had a panel with two of the actors from the Mortal Kombat reboot movie.
2543271	2549267	Ludi, who played Liu Kang, and Max, who played Kung Lao, were on this panel with me.
2550210	2552496	It was a Sunday 10am panel.
2552847	2557801	And I realized pretty quickly, about 10 minutes to the panel, there were not going to be a lot of people in the room.
2558403	2561491	And sure enough, there were maybe 15 people that showed up for that panel.
2561531	2563356	Because it's a Sunday morning panel.
2563697	2565222	And when are all the big parties, Loki?
2565843	2566846	Saturday night.
2567087	2567869	That's right.
2567849	2586060	and it's 10am right when programming starts that day but you know what those two guys were fucking professionals and they gave the same quality panel they would have given to a room full of 500 people and I thought it was a great conversation again because there were less people there to ask questions the onus was kind of on me to ask questions
2586040	2611069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2611049	2615534	I would, like, they're the types of guys you would like to just go have a drink with and talk about video games.
2615554	2618617	Because I will tell you, Ludi absolutely plays video games.
2618637	2623903	I don't know about Max, but this was also his first convention of any kind.
2624704	2634675	So I think Max was kind of in the overwhelmed mode, but it was very obvious that Max is very, very dedicated to the craft of martial artists and, like, emphasis on artists.
2634695	2636677	Like, that guy is just like an artist.
2636697	2637698	He's a professional.
2637678	2649009	and had a lot to just kind of talk about, like his journey in not just Hollywood, but making movies in China and, you know, other places, you know, just to bring these, you know, characters to life.
2649049	2651371	And I thought it was great.
2651411	2653593	Again, it's one of those, if you weren't there, I'm sorry.
2653934	2661421	But, you know, 12 lucky fucking people got to see a really great discussion with those guys who were nothing but professional.
2661441	2663243	And I really enjoyed working with them.
2663723	2667567	And it was interesting because the news about the movie getting pushed back,
2667547	2668830	to Summer, the sequel.
2669050	2671556	I don't know if you heard Loki, but the sequel got pushed back to Summer.
2671876	2673720	It was supposed to be out in October and they pushed it back.
2673740	2677669	And I think they're doing it for they can make more money in the summer type of reasons.
2678851	2681237	So obviously the actors have nothing to do with any of that.
2681257	2684644	They didn't have a lot to say about it, but they just, you know, the typical...
2684624	2699359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2699542	2703732	I did get to do a panel with some of the voice actors from Baldur's Gate 3.
2704453	2708403	So last year we had like half the cast of Baldur's Gate 3 was there.
2708884	2711350	This year we had the other half.
2711370	2714116	So we had Amelia who played the narrator.
2714216	2715619	We had Karlak's voice actor.
2715640	2717043	We had the absolute.
2717083	2717584	We have...
2717564	2720049	We had a lot of great voice actors.
2720089	2722253	And that was a strict Q&A panel.
2722713	2724657	And there was a lot of great questions from the audience.
2725078	2726560	They really know how to roll with it.
2726621	2731289	And again, that's a group that you know they do conventions together all the time.
2731449	2732471	And they have fun with it.
2732531	2734675	And those Baldur's Gate folks are just a lot of fun.
2734695	2737260	They did another panel with...
2737240	2758928	Mark Muir from Mass Effect Mark Muir's at DragonCon every fucking year because he loves the culture, he loves the people and he's an awesome guy and he's the guy that plays M-Shep and Mark actually does a D&D roleplay panel with the cast and I'll tell you that panel fills up like
2758908	2779178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2779158	2785688	I think maybe the description of the panel maybe was missing a few keywords it really needed to get noticed.
2785728	2788172	But I'll give that feedback to the appropriate people.
2788773	2791958	But I got to sit down with Sean Copeland from Blizzard.
2791978	2794081	And he is what's called the lore master.
2794141	2796104	I think he has like an official title.
2796144	2802273	But basically like all the lore through Warcraft, like he is that human Wikipedia.
2802834	2805418	And, you know, when you start to think about it,
2805398	2823188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2823168	2841852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2841832	2869780	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2870165	2893928	and DarkSakura.com
2893908	2900996	Questbuster in chat says, your WoW guest also reminds me that Star Wars also has a lore guy who is like a living holocron of everything in that universe.
2901057	2904621	Yes, it's that for Blizzard stuff.
2904641	2910888	And I was able to ask just a couple things about Diablo, because that's my jam, but he's not as involved with that as he is Warcraft.
2911689	2913211	But that was just fun.
2913291	2919038	I really hope he's back next year and I get to run that panel again, because yes, I will just nerd out about video games for an hour.
2919018	2920762	Yeah, so that was fun.
2922024	2927195	And I truly do get just as excited about those types of panels as I do the celebrity panels.
2928277	2931865	But I'm so thankful to DragonCon for the opportunity at all.
2931885	2936113	And I am thankful to people that show up and ask the good questions that make the panels run.
2936594	2937837	So, yeah.
2937817	2939780	Make your plans to attend DragonCon next year.
2939800	2941282	It's going to be the 40th DragonCon.
2941663	2945388	Not the 40th annual DragonCon, but the 40th DragonCon.
2945469	2948333	There's a difference because the first year would be number one.
2948834	2952619	So technically, even though it started in 87, next year is 40.
2953320	2954763	So it's going to be the 40th DragonCon.
2955364	2958408	They're pulling out all the stops next year for the 40th is what I hear.
2958508	2959590	That's the buzz.
2959610	2961293	So be there.
2961713	2963836	Make your plans to go to Labor Day, Atlanta.
2964397	2964938	Be there.
2966555	2968599	Loki, you got to go DragonCon, Loki.
2969180	2969701	You got to go.
2969981	2970782	Probably not next year.
2971343	2972846	I think I want to go to TwitchCon again.
2974068	2974870	That makes sense.
2974890	2975370	I understand.
2975411	2976432	TwitchCon's got a lot going on.
2976452	2977735	I have to skip TwitchCon this year.
2977755	2980900	I just heard, too, they got Trixie Mattel hosting the drag show at TwitchCon this year.
2981281	2982082	That's going to be a lot of fun.
2982242	2987291	But sadly, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on that I really wish I was able to go.
2987311	2989395	But yeah, I just can't swing it.
2989415	2990537	Yeah, I get it.
2991530	2997533	Alright, well let's talk about some other things going on in gaming and the week in gaming news.
2997774	3001067	So Loki, I know we have some headlines to talk about tonight.
3001127	3002974	Do you have a few things you want to walk us through tonight?
3003089	3004592	Uh, sure, we can talk about a few things.
3004652	3007117	So, uh, one is Nintendo Switch.
3007598	3022106	They've made some updates to the Game Boy Advance emulation, so added some enhancements to that, including, uh, now you can also, uh, basically play in 1080p now, which is nice.
3022207	3023950	You can even, um...
3024976	3025396	What else?
3025416	3034746	They have controller mapping, which I think is something that they had in some of the other emulators, but now they've added it to the Switch as well, so that's kind of cool that you can do that.
3037049	3037750	What else?
3037850	3045978	They also allow you to run the game in a tiny window to recreate the effect of playing it on the actual device.
3046018	3048841	The actual resolution, basically, of the original.
3049122	3049522	That's cool.
3049983	3051544	Yeah, I don't know if I'd do that on a TV.
3051624	3052165	I'd just be like...
3053309	3054090	It's so small.
3055332	3057055	Even on a Switch, that'd be really small, too.
3057696	3064728	It's nice that they're at least adding some more of those features to basically allow you to take advantage of the Switch 2 and stuff.
3065229	3066531	And I mean, remappable buttons.
3066572	3068194	Why wasn't that a thing?
3068234	3072141	That's a thing for absolutely every single emulator out there.
3072281	3073343	I just don't get it.
3073323	3082539	Bobby Blackwolf in chat does point out they debuted controller mappings in the new N64 and Gabecube ones and they've been slowly backporting them to the earlier ones.
3082879	3085764	But yes, it is one of those things you kind of go, why wasn't it there from the start?
3086726	3088328	Right, and it's like a feature that you would think.
3088348	3089290	This is happening now.
3089860	3092182	would be in there, but okay.
3092382	3093803	So yeah, so that's that.
3093843	3094944	That's kind of cool.
3094964	3103272	Along with that, Switch Online is also adding Forsaken 64, which is a mature title.
3103292	3104833	Those were those commercials back in the day.
3104853	3106194	The future is Forsaken.
3106394	3107896	Those commercials, right?
3108376	3109077	I remember that game.
3109097	3110058	I remember it on PlayStation.
3110078	3111619	I don't remember the 64 version.
3112560	3117024	It's also, yeah, so Forsaken is going to be coming, which is pretty awesome.
3117084	3118725	I don't remember that game too much.
3118745	3119766	I know I played it,
3119746	3122208	But I don't remember what it was.
3122709	3126933	Because I remember that the advertisements made no sense compared to what the game was.
3128234	3129235	I remember that too.
3129776	3131958	That was such the thing with video games back in the day.
3132318	3135862	And I know I bring this game up at least once a month on this show.
3135882	3139626	But you remember Phalanx on the Super Nintendo that had the old guy playing the banjo on the cover?
3140166	3141307	It was a shmup.
3141327	3143409	And like, how the fuck am I supposed to tell this is a shmup?
3143429	3145451	Except that there was a little spaceship flying in the background.
3145511	3146192	It's like...
3146172	3147763	Did you not see the tiny spaceship?
3147783	3150381	Did you not see the tiny spaceship that told you this is a shmup game?
3150643	3151086	Anyway.
3151673	3181528	but yeah that's cool so also cool with enhancements to some of these online platforms so Xbox GameCloud is coming to lower Game Pass tiers also adding some PC games as well so they're going to be adding the Xbox Cloud Gaming to Game Pass Core or Standard tiers as well and previously it was only available in the highest tier, the Ultimate tier but I guess now
3181593	3198572	and DarkSakura.
3198552	3225403	The stuff that's going to be lowest tier, these are games that stopped making Microsoft active money a long time ago But in the sense of a library, there's basically classics at this point of a sort Maybe not as old as Nintendo classics, but they're classics of a sort They're still going to add value when you're debating if you want to get a Game Pass subscription or not So I don't see how this is a bad thing for Microsoft and a win for the consumer as well, honestly
3226396	3229299	Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty cool.
3230401	3240733	I was also going to mention, there's a lot of news around Atari and bringing back older... I mean, that's kind of what Atari does, but bringing back old franchises, not even necessarily Atari franchises.
3240753	3245738	So Atari, they've acquired... Atari has been bringing back old franchises for like 40 years.
3245758	3248662	That is their whole... By the way, I have a rant.
3248682	3249703	I have a rant.
3250223	3251704	Did you see this on my Blue Sky?
3251724	3253286	Because I post about this on Blue Sky.
3253306	3254307	I don't know if I did.
3254547	3255088	Here's the deal.
3255728	3256689	So I'm on the internet.
3256769	3262675	And you know how like when you launch Microsoft Edge, the default page is like a bunch of news headlines and there's ads broken in and stuff?
3263155	3269181	One of the ads that was on there says, do you want to play classic Atari games?
3269201	3272144	And it says like Missile Command, Centipede, Pong.
3272945	3278050	Join the AARP now and play Atari games.
3278070	3279471	And I was like...
3279704	3280245	Rude.
3281126	3281506	Rude.
3281646	3288114	And it's funny because I posted about it on Blue Sky, and actually, I don't know if it went viral, but it went semi-viral.
3288134	3296424	And of course, I get the replies from the people that are like, well, the AARP doesn't just target people that are retired because they want to get you before they're retired.
3296444	3297465	It's like, I know that.
3297505	3298306	Look, I know that.
3298747	3304834	But then there was a reply from somebody I don't know, but a reply that perfectly encapsulated it that's like...
3304814	3310041	They might sell this to people of all ages, but it's still rude.
3311142	3314586	I was like, yes, you get it, what I was going for there.
3314606	3315267	Exactly.
3315307	3317130	I'm like, don't call me old.
3317590	3319933	It was that Jamie Lee Curtis from Freaky Friday.
3320514	3321575	I'm old.
3322656	3323357	Bury that.
3324579	3324679	Yeah.
3325604	3332034	So they've acquired, was it Ubisoft's Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden.
3332575	3333917	Oh, right, the Child of Eden.
3334177	3337403	That's right, Atari did get the Child of Eden thing.
3337423	3338484	That's wild to me.
3339846	3341289	Yeah, and Grow Up.
3341970	3347258	So yeah, Child of Eden is the one that's most exciting, because that's very, like, res...
3347660	3351945	I mean, that game practically is like a Rez game, but it's not.
3353307	3357833	Very excited to see something like that, but they're planning on doing something with that, I guess.
3357853	3360496	Can I give you a crazy fucking Rob Stradamus idea?
3361637	3361958	Sure.
3361978	3375555	I don't know if this one will come true, but I think there is a very... Like, where all the pieces are falling, with Atari grabbing this, this is where I think it might be headed.
3375575	3375675	Okay.
3375740	3382864	Maybe we're going to get some sort of digital eclipse museum collection for Rez and Child of Eden.
3384245	3412918	I would love think about think about how fucking transformative those games were and think about how they will release they will re-release Rez for any reason and think about how transformative those games were and how special they were you know with you know everybody knows about the trans vibrator and stuff with the Dreamcast and all this and you know there's probably so much to say about these games and the music and the soundtrack and putting that all together what if
3412898	3418383	Digital Eclipse is putting together some type of Mizuguchi Rez collection.
3419564	3420585	I mean, that would be really cool.
3422127	3427812	Honestly, if that's why Atari got the rights, screaming, crying, throwing up with joy.
3428152	3430475	That's going to be an incredible thing if it happens.
3430495	3433437	And Rez is 1999, right?
3433938	3434939	No, I guess that came out later.
3435119	3436280	It would have been like 2001.
3436580	3439023	But that game is still well over 20 years old at this point.
3439083	3440164	It's a classic.
3440184	3442686	It can be in one of these museum things.
3442666	3444768	Yeah, Child of Eden was at 2011.
3444788	3452616	Yeah, but it's... Why not, you know, if there was going to be a... I think there's a lot of people that have been asking, whatever happened to Child of Eden?
3452636	3454358	Why can't we revisit Child of Eden?
3454378	3470395	And if it is not literally that, like them going to bring back Child of Eden, I think there's a real possibility we're going to get some sort of definitive collection of these Mizuguchi shooter games, including Area Zero, and maybe some more stuff conceptually what Res VR would have been.
3470375	3492130	you know excuse me what that would have been because you know a fuller game and VR and all this stuff so you can put that on my prediction board because I just I can't shake it like Atari getting that game it just that's the only way the pieces add up to me but maybe it's wishful thinking and that's fine too
3493898	3517594	and then um along with that also Atari uh could be responsible for another game coming back as well um so there's also the uh where to go here uh the rights for uh was it Natsumi Atari has filed trademark for Shatterhand in Japan so Shatterhand was an old 2D action game from the NES and
3518097	3527092	and it sounds like them registering that maybe a sequel is in the works or a remake or a re-release or something like that.
3528514	3529055	That could be cool.
3532080	3532721	What else?
3532742	3533463	Let's see.
3534404	3539633	We could talk about how they're going to be remaking Puzzle Quest.
3540153	3541334	I remember that game.
3541354	3541695	That was awesome.
3541715	3542736	I kind of miss Puzzle Quest.
3542796	3543877	Puzzle Quest was fun.
3544258	3551485	I don't want to say it went off the rails, but I think it fell down that hole of mobile gaming, microtransaction-y, kind of crappy crap.
3551505	3554329	But the original two on Xbox Arcade were great.
3555170	3556131	Yeah.
3556331	3565161	So they're doing a remake of that, or remaster, I should say, called the Immortal Edition, and it's going to be boosting, obviously, the HD.
3565961	3569265	It's also supposed to have...
3569583	3572388	I'm not sure what other platforms is coming out on as well.
3572468	3582885	Other than you have the visuals, it looks like pretty much all the platforms and Steam, good old games, Epic Games, all the consoles.
3583787	3584568	So that should be fun.
3584588	3585911	And what else?
3588936	3589897	Yeah, let me see.
3589917	3591179	That's September 18th, actually.
3591219	3592722	So that's right around the corner.
3593107	3594889	Like, two weeks away for that one.
3596171	3601437	This is out of nowhere, kind of one of those, like, what year is it type of situations.
3602558	3608384	Acclaim is hosting a Play Acclaim Showcase September 10th.
3608505	3617595	Okay, that's that whole thing where, like, the name ended up in the bargain basement auction list and, like, somebody else bought the name and, like, so, like...
3618638	3623349	I can't, I don't, if I'm following this right and chat, you can course correct me if I'm wrong.
3623369	3629022	But if I remember everything that went down with Acclaim, this is not anything to do with Acclaim in the 1980s.
3629183	3632310	This is, here's what we're going to do with the new name.
3633927	3659884	well it is how it still has to do with games and because they were shown off the old games that they had i just don't know what they're doing with that necessarily it's not going to be anything you remember it's probably probably going to be indie titles getting a boost which is fine there's probably some good shit in there you know but um level set your level set your expectations folks fine i will set my expectations thank you very good
3660910	3661713	What else?
3663199	3665728	EA's not doing a college basketball game anymore.
3667394	3670887	So, I guess college basketball saved?
3671373	3676918	Oh no, that gaming series I would have never purchased in my entire life is going away.
3677098	3691271	Yeah, apparently because some schools are choosing to accept 2K sports proposal for the inclusion of NBA 2K so allowing college basketball to be in that game they said everyone at EA Sports is disappointed.
3691291	3698798	Yes, I'm sure that you guys are disappointed but considering how you've treated Madden and treated
3699419	3702548	Soccer or football, EA Sports Football or whatever.
3702929	3705376	Yeah, no.
3706178	3711673	No, I think everyone's better off without EA Sports Innovation.
3711873	3741829	Bobby Blackwolf clarifies in chat they're making college basketball DLC for NBA 2K series instead of a separate game thank you sports people for translating because you know again I don't I just go when are they going to re-release NBA Jam for the fourth time well I mean so yeah I mean the problem is right now is all these exclusivity deals that they do so that your NBA games can really only be on like one studio is the problem so they make these bad deals and then
3742332	3761590	now I mean sure they're profitable but like they're not good I don't know but cool I guess at least there's some basketball uh college basketball representation um unfortunately it's either me 2k or EA with those yeah um
3762700	3763401	This is kind of funny.
3763761	3781263	So, of course, you know, with the whole Stop Killing Games initiative and everything, that folks are trying to essentially make sure these online games and stuff don't get, you know, taken offline permanently.
3781724	3783226	Three months after you buy the game.
3783826	3784487	Exactly.
3784507	3789113	So, apparently, there are some modders who are bringing the crew back.
3789920	3819842	They are working on being able to run the game.
3819822	3828313	Custom Servers or something like that Apparently you can run the server emulator on your own PC and giving them an offline mode
3829070	3830813	Wow, look at that.
3831273	3840708	These modders deserve gold star badges, medals of honor for just sticking it to Ubisoft who says it's too complicated.
3840748	3842630	It's too hard to get this game offline.
3842651	3844153	We wasn't designed to be offline.
3844173	3848339	I just love that modders just shut that whole argument down.
3848359	3849080	Shut it down.
3849962	3850743	Love that for you.
3851444	3851584	Mm-hmm.
3853167	3881503	so, and there you go, now you can preserve the game or at least, you know, some of it and they should be able to do it scot-free because I swear to god, if Ubisoft tries to cease and desist this thing, it's gonna get uglier for them of course they would they would absolutely die I know, I know it's coming, and that's why I'm like y'all better think that one through y'all better think that one through real hard with all the online, you know petitions and stuff, and where the online favor is at yeah
3882952	3900117	and then, let's see what else I've run out of stuff already well, good news I guess with the reception to the physical carts on the Switch 2 versus the what was it, the
3900738	3902260	CodeCarts or whatever they're calling them.
3902280	3908127	Basically, they're physical, but they're still downloaded.
3908428	3918120	So Cyberpunk, it says 75% of the sales for the Switch 2 were physical, which is interesting considering that that was one of the games that didn't have the key cards.
3918661	3922125	It was the actual game on the cartridge.
3922546	3924729	There was another game that was talking about that.
3924809	3926811	I don't remember which one it was recently.
3926851	3929715	They were saying that the reason that they didn't do...
3929695	3953779	or they did it keycard is because that the game wouldn't run well off of the cartridge essentially that it couldn't stream the assets fast enough to which I ask well couldn't you just download the game off the cartridge then onto the device and still use the cartridge I mean that sounds like that would solve the problem if that's the issue but
3955582	3963451	Yeah, interesting to see that a good majority of the sales were physical, so there is some interest at least in physical on the Switch 2.
3963832	3977067	I think, you know, anything, we don't trust that these companies are going to keep these servers up, you know, indefinitely, and so eventually those key cards are going to stop working, and that's a problem.
3977418	3997671	but hopefully this will at least send the message loud and clear that like hey people are interested in purchasing actual physical copies of things it's just when you do key cards that's not really physical is it see what else here mm-hmm
4000132	4005904	I got one for you guys because I think this came up earlier in the show and Jason mentioned it in the intro.
4006244	4012778	But it's about Luminous Arise because I'm actually kind of pissed off about this because the demo for Luminous Arise came out.
4012898	4013740	This is why I'm pissed off.
4013780	4017347	It already closed September 3rd, so I never got a chance to play it.
4017327	4021131	But we do know when it's coming out now, so we do have a date for Luminous Rise.
4021151	4025015	It's coming out for PlayStation 5, and of course this is going to be a VR title, and I'm sure it'll be cool.
4025636	4028919	It is coming out on November 11th, also Steam and SteamVR.
4029239	4034425	It will be $39.99, whether that's dollars or euros or 5,400 yen.
4035286	4039010	And of course that is coming from Enhance and Monstars.
4039050	4043554	There was a demo that came out, but if you're a dumb bitch like me, you missed it already.
4043574	4045016	But you were kind of busy, I'm sure.
4045136	4047098	I'm sure you had a good reason for missing it.
4047078	4047819	I'll pick it up though.
4051244	4062100	Looks like Capcom is forming a new or they're having I guess there's a new studio forming of old Capcom veterans.
4062120	4065705	So it's Suno is the studio there.
4065825	4073136	They've hired some folks that were making up, I guess, Street Fighter, the Street Fighter and Devil May Cry.
4073116	4097322	DevTeams, so former director Hideki Isuno, and also, let's see who else was on here, Daigo Akino, as well as artists that designed the characters, or designed features, I guess, or character designs in Devil May Cry and the Street Fighter series, as well as the art director for Dragon's Dogma.
4097342	4102988	And then we've got, let's see here,
4104959	4105800	What else?
4105820	4117172	I don't know what games they're going to be working on just yet, but it is exciting to see a lot of these old devs working together on hopefully like a new indie game or something like that.
4120716	4120956	All right.
4121016	4125521	Well, why don't I do the classic game of the week and then if you find anything else, we can do it after classic game.
4125561	4125962	Sound good?
4127063	4127583	All right.
4127844	4128364	Let's get to it.
4128384	4132789	We're going to go into the classic game of the week, but we couldn't do this segment without a bumper.
4143080	4150908	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4150928	4154712	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4154732	4158415	Alright, but DarkSakura is not here tonight.
4158436	4159276	I can't believe it.
4159837	4167585	But that means I'm going to pick the classic game tonight and I'm going to pick a game that is similar to one I've done before but it is distinctively different.
4167985	4170808	It's a game called Summer Games 2.
4170788	4178335	That's right, it is the sequel, of course, to the game Summer Games, which I have featured on a previous episode of this show, but it was a very, very long time ago.
4178915	4183920	Summer Games 2, of course, was released in 1985 for the Commodore 64.
4184701	4191827	It was an Epyx title, E-P-Y-X, not to be confused with Epic Games, but Epyx released this game, and U.S.
4191887	4200795	Gold was the publisher in Europe, and it is inspired by the Olympic Games, I guess you could say, but technically not an Olympic license.
4200775	4207945	Although they use the interlude, but I think because that's based on a classical song, they can probably get away with it.
4207965	4220061	So the interesting thing was, in this game, when you picked your character, you could actually say, oh, your character's from the USA, your character's from Italy, Canada, or you could say they're from the country of epics.
4220842	4224707	That's right, epics had their own flag in that, so...
4224687	4228112	That was available as a country that you could select.
4228132	4231516	In Summer Games 2, there were eight events that you could pick from.
4231897	4239226	Triple Jump, High Jump, Rowing, Javelin, Equestrian, Fencing, Kayaking, and Cycling.
4239567	4250982	We do get into some deeper cuts than what you might associate, like the typical type of running events, because the original Summer Games had those games in them.
4250962	4273746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4273726	4281096	So it ended up being like the first sort of like standalone graphics pack type of thing.
4281497	4286864	Or not standalone graphics, a DLC pack that actually merged with the original game if you had it.
4286884	4288947	So I thought that was like really cool.
4288967	4294574	We didn't really see anything like that again in 1985 when this particular game was released.
4294594	4296477	So...
4296457	4310127	The original Commodore 64 version of this game was created by Scott Nelson, John Lupp, Chuck Somerville, true story, friend of mine, know him, he's a great guy, Kevin Norman, Michael Kosaka, and Larry Clegg.
4310288	4313655	And I'm pretty sure they all worked on
4313635	4333095	and DarkSakura.
4333075	4334958	Amiga had a version as well.
4334998	4337563	So this was popular enough that it got ported.
4337583	4341690	It also actually came out on the Virtual Console for the Nintendo Wii.
4342130	4348361	So if you might remember, there was a time when Commodore 64 games were available on the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console.
4348381	4356535	And so Europe added these on June 27, 2008, and North America got this on March 16, 2009.
4356515	4373646	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4373626	4376431	But yeah, Summer Games 2, very well received.
4376511	4380097	The magazine Zap64 gave it a 97%.
4381259	4388070	And many people feel that this was one of the really great Commodore 64 games that came out.
4388110	4391977	And as a child who played an awful lot of this game, I agree.
4391997	4398047	So for those that are watching live on Twitch, you actually can see right now we are looking at the rowing event that's happening here.
4398027	4421065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4421045	4436421	and the other player was doing and of course Commodore 64 did have a few of these games I remember Spy vs. Spy was another one that had the really cool sort of split screen view where you can see where things are going on and yeah but just really cool for its time so a game that I spent an awful lot of time on
4436941	4439504	As a kid, Summer Games 2.
4440025	4444551	And of course, being able to plug and play with the original Summer Games was a big part of that as well.
4444571	4448315	I'm so distracted by the fact that the two names on there are from Monkey Island.
4448716	4451079	The Secret of Monkey Island, Guybrush and Stan.
4452020	4457127	The YouTube account this long play comes from is also inspired by that.
4457768	4460191	But you know, classic games of that era.
4460271	4461592	I can't be too surprised, right?
4462534	4464276	Yeah, they're just a classic game of the week.
4464676	4466779	Summer Games 2!
4466877	4467658	Awesome, awesome.
4468479	4469060	All right.
4469421	4474387	Hey, I don't usually shout these out because we're recording a podcast live, but Clawstorm, I just saw that you rated us.
4474428	4475309	Thank you so much for that.
4475409	4476971	I really appreciate that.
4476991	4487706	And yeah, it was good to see you at the Digital Media Mixer, but I feel like I really just saw you for 10 seconds and then didn't really get to talk more because there were a lot of people there, which is a great thing.
4487726	4489088	I didn't even talk about that.
4489068	4494994	for the, when I was talking about DragonCon, we did a digital media mixer on Thursday night.
4495054	4500459	And last year we did this and we got maybe like 15 people in the room, but we loved it.
4500499	4501059	We had fun.
4501540	4507025	This year, Bobby and I sat down and went, let's reword this in the program.
4507105	4514452	Let's help our track director out and let's rewrite this in a way that's going to attract people to the event.
4514472	4515893	The room was full, Loki.
4515913	4517615	We had like at least 60 people in there.
4517675	4517775	Nice.
4517755	4541890	in and out throughout the evening I met some really I met a very large YouTube affiliated person that just happened to be hanging out at DragonCon that was really cool to talk to met some up and coming folks I loved it, it was so fun so we're going to try to do that again next year if the track director will let us, which I hope he will we're going to try to make that a Thursday thing every year except next year I'm going to ask for the ballroom
4541870	4542852	Although I don't think we can.
4542872	4544154	I think they do a charity event in there.
4544795	4548220	So we just might have to deal with the fact that we have the room that we have.
4548240	4549262	But we filled it out this year.
4549282	4550543	It was a lot of fun.
4550564	4551906	So it was good.
4551926	4554149	So thanks, Class Storm, for being here and bringing your community here.
4554189	4555571	Really appreciate that.
4555671	4565667	We are Orange Launch Radio, a very long-running podcast, 23 years and counting, recording our show live here on Twitch television for you all to enjoy and participate with.
4565647	4594995	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says ballrooms are either not ready or are used for parties but like doesn't this kind of wouldn't a mixer especially if we added a little music and I don't know punch and pie let's add punch and pie to the mixer event now it's a party right all right I'm not gonna get into the weeds with it I'm just gonna say we need to do it again we need to do it again next year we gotta go bigger bigger all right um that's that's it for the classic game you want to go back to news Loki
4595853	4596654	Uh, sure.
4596854	4603825	Yeah, so I was going to mention, even though this was a little bit ago, this would have been like last week, but No Man's Sky, another update.
4604105	4608552	They have Voyager's 6.0 update, which is absolutely massive.
4608652	4609153	I gotta check that out.
4609573	4613299	It sounds like, I'm not getting the sense of what's massive about it.
4613479	4614340	I'm going to be quite honest.
4614400	4618086	It sounds like they're letting you build out what's in your ship a little more.
4618126	4619368	Yeah, basically.
4620029	4622232	You could always do that with the freighter.
4622667	4624209	You already had a ship you could build out.
4624529	4624850	I don't know.
4624890	4626191	I got to see it.
4626412	4627893	I am not a No Man's Sky hater.
4627974	4629215	I fucking love that game.
4629235	4631598	So I will check this out for sure.
4631638	4632599	I've just been kind of busy.
4632960	4637585	But yeah, like I was getting a hard time from reading the comments.
4637625	4641270	I was like, isn't this kind of already in the game with the freighter customization?
4641851	4645615	I guess they made it, you know, so they can do with the actual ships as well.
4645675	4649620	So you can kind of, you know, recreate stuff or just, you know.
4650038	4672567	Do things like that Bobby Blackwolf in chat says I thought it was more like actual shipbuilding like Starfield I had heard it's very similar to Starfield Yes, it is similar to Starfield Oh, the outward customization That makes a little more sense So wait, does that mean Wait, if I can customize it outward Does that mean I can build a flying dick?
4673268	4674589	Does that mean that's what people are doing?
4674609	4676772	I think that's already been a thing Yeah
4676752	4679275	I think you can already do that.
4679755	4680476	People already found the aliens.
4680496	4682198	What was that thing in Spaceballs called?
4682218	4683579	She's gone from suck to blow.
4683599	4685421	What was that in Spaceballs?
4685441	4686843	I can build one of those as my ship?
4686863	4687544	The Mega Maid?
4687724	4688344	The Mega Maid!
4688465	4689265	That's it, the Mega Maid.
4695953	4697935	Let me live my fantasy.
4699797	4705763	This isn't really gaming news, but there's a new Tron Ares ad
4707059	4708261	featuring like, okay.
4708628	4716054	Tron Ares is already, like, kind of, like, you know, it's borderline, like, yeah, it's awesome, it's Tron, but Jared let out you, you know?
4716135	4718116	It's kind of, like, riding that line already.
4718437	4720098	It's so complicated.
4720638	4722620	And look, look, look, y'all, what's that?
4722640	4724402	What's that over there behind me?
4724422	4726323	I know you can't see it on the podcast, so I'll tell you.
4726564	4728726	There is a replica Tron machine.
4729446	4730707	They don't even make these anymore.
4730807	4737353	Limited time, arcade one up, replica machine in my house, and I'm conflicted on this new Tron.
4737333	4738515	I really don't like Jared Leto.
4738615	4739657	I really don't like him.
4740299	4746049	And then the marketing team behind the Tron Ares movie is like, hey, I have an idea.
4746089	4748374	Let's push it more into that you cringe side.
4748775	4753283	And they did an ad spot with Mr. Beast as now one of the
4753550	4755512	That just seems desperate.
4755572	4758075	And I'm not knocking on Mr. Beast.
4758095	4759477	He's very popular for a reason.
4759497	4759677	Why not?
4759697	4761419	We should knock on Mr. Beast.
4761619	4762720	Here's the thing.
4763061	4764282	Here's what it is.
4764302	4770329	It just reeks of the boardroom going, what can we do that's going to be hip and cool with Gen Z?
4770689	4772011	Who does Gen Z like?
4772451	4774293	Mr. Beast!
4775294	4777237	Get the Beast on the phone!
4777377	4779439	It just reeks of...
4779757	4783461	Somebody doesn't know what to do, so they're just throwing everything at the wall.
4784763	4790970	I really feel Disney is setting this movie up to fail, and that's what pisses me off as a Tron fan.
4790990	4794754	But we should get a bitchin' new Nine Inch Nails album out of it, so at least there's that.
4795495	4805967	Yeah, I've already been listening to the first track that they released, so... I think actually the album may have come out already for that, because I was hearing some other stuff...
4806638	4808727	Oh gosh, there was some other stuff that came out.
4810797	4813288	Oh, I saw on YouTube, actually, that was from the album as well.
4813369	4816362	So it probably has come out already.
4817253	4821822	TigerClaw on chat says, I heard they're re-releasing Tron and Tron Legacy in 4K on Blu-ray.
4821842	4822363	That's true.
4822623	4829978	And they're doing a double feature of Tron Legacy and Ares, which sounds... I would do that.
4829998	4831160	That would be the way I prefer to see it.
4831260	4832022	I'm still going to go see it.
4832042	4832743	I love Legacy.
4832763	4833925	I love Legacy.
4833986	4835248	I would just go see Legacy again.
4835268	4836009	It's so good.
4836731	4836831	Yeah.
4837047	4841476	So, yeah, Fifth Dream says I've got it pre-ordered the 19th, I think.
4841516	4843600	If I could still get a pre-order for that, I'll get it.
4844041	4850694	I have the Clue 4K Blu-ray coming that is also coming out around that same time in October, funny enough, because that movie just turned 40.
4851195	4855263	So I have that coming, but I will add Tron and Tron Legacy to it.
4855303	4855683	Why not?
4856204	4858549	The original Tron...
4858529	4881006	look so strange in 4k now like but not in a bad way like it's just like those old computer graphics the way they've been up up dude for 4k blu-ray and stuff is just it's so interesting anyway yeah all right shall we travel around the world and check out some release dates we can yeah let's do it let's start in the U.S.

4924977	4929723	That's right, PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
4929983	4933067	Why would they not work a lasagna pun into it somehow?
4933167	4935190	Like, you're not trying, Garfield people.
4935290	4935871	You're not trying.
4935891	4938234	It's like All You Can Eat, but now it's All You Can Drift.
4938515	4939055	Eh, they tried.

4953350	4969633	Marvel Rivals coming to PlayStation 4 NHL 26 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series and Roman Sans RE Build on I guess it's Rebuild, probably a remaster I'm guessing.

4977063	4978565	Alright, that's it out of the US.
4980588	4981129	And
4981210	4983352	Do you want to do the Asian dates?
4983372	4985114	Sure, let's go to Japan.
4985214	4986275	Let's check out what's going on there.
4986295	4988577	Not a lot on the Nintendo Switch 2 this week.
4988797	4990879	There's actually nothing coming out on the Nintendo Switch 2.
4991459	4993561	A little bit more going on on the PlayStation 5.
4993621	4998385	We have Firefighting Simulator Ignite comes out on September 9th.
4998546	4999767	That is coming out in Japan.
5000127	5008975	And then we have Paper Ghost Stories Third Eye Open is coming out in Japan on September the 11th, which happens to be Loki's birthday, by the way.
5008995	5011217	So happy early birthday, Loki, because I just realized
5011197	5012900	That's in the next week.
5012920	5013982	45.
5014242	5015284	You, you.
5015304	5016286	Oh, you're still a baby.
5016587	5019071	That's why you're taking time off work, isn't it?
5019091	5020394	You celebrate your birthday by not working.
5020414	5022317	Any excuse not to go to work.
5022337	5022658	Good for you.
5022798	5023339	Good for you.
5023760	5024060	All right.
5024421	5027907	And stories from Seoul, the gundog.
5027887	5028628	I'm into that.
5028668	5029810	I want to hear the Gundog story.
5029850	5033374	That is also out on the PlayStation 5 in Japan this week on the 11th.
5034035	5036719	Sunnyside also releases in Japan on the 11th.
5037160	5041686	And Biohazard Village Z. Y'all know that that's Resident Evil over there.
5042287	5044209	A Gold Edition gets a price reduction.
5044229	5047894	So it's basically a re-release into the Best Price series.
5047914	5054223	And then I'm pretty sure this is one that is just a nationwide, or excuse me, a worldwide release, including Japan.
5054363	5057387	Borderlands 4 is out on September the 12th.
5057367	5065200	and I'm pretty sure that's the case everywhere but Japan is no different on the PlayStation 5 although I thought wasn't that game getting a Switch 2 version?
5066311	5070136	Um, maybe at a later date, I'm guessing.
5070236	5073280	For some reason, yeah, for some reason that's not hitting, at least in Japan.
5073421	5074923	Maybe it's, you know, something.
5074943	5076945	It's not, it's also not here either.
5077186	5078928	It wasn't in the US.
5079028	5080330	So maybe at a later date.
5080370	5082192	I thought it was getting a Switch 2 version at some point.
5082253	5083354	So yeah, maybe it's a later date.
5083494	5083795	I mean, maybe.
5083815	5089002	It's just one of those, like, they gotta shove it onto the cartridge and, you know, all that stuff.
5089042	5092386	Let's see, Borderlands 2, Switch 2.
5092406	5095170	But that's it for Japanese releases.
5096450	5097972	Yeah, I was just trying to see.
5099174	5101097	Wow, that's super helpful, Nintendo.
5101838	5102438	Oh, there you go.
5103580	5105543	Let's see what date they listed as.
5107986	5114496	They say October 3rd for Borderlands 2, or 4 for the Switch 2.
5115197	5116939	So a little bit later, about a month later.

5238331	5240897	Yeah, there's more dippy direct rumors out there.
5240997	5243884	Apparently they're really convinced a direct is going to happen.
5243944	5247673	It's going to talk more about Final Fantasy 7 related stuff on the Switch 2.
5248174	5249016	So we'll see.

5260950	5264376	If you want to join the green room on our Discord server, vognetwork.com.
5264456	5274633	I'm actually scrolling way up in chat to grab this one that SGO100Matt sent to us asking if we had seen the Tron Ares popcorn bucket.
5274653	5279361	And I was not aware that there was a popcorn bucket coming because apparently it lights up.
5279341	5302750	Popcorn Bucket
5304586	5306370	Oh, I didn't see that.
5306410	5308314	It's a Tron Ares arcade cabinet.
5308414	5309938	But it's still a Tron cabinet.
5309958	5311942	It's got the Tron joystick on it.
5311962	5312584	Oh, fuck me.
5312604	5313606	I have to get that.
5313666	5314909	It's at Regal Theaters.
5314929	5316452	God damn it.
5316871	5317693	Goddammit.
5317713	5325127	The same thing that sucks about those is, like, they're, like, $80 for those stupid, like, buckets.
5325147	5326129	Are you serious?
5326349	5326890	They want $80?
5326910	5333503	Sometimes, like, yeah, like, what was it, the Minecraft one, the pickaxe, was, like, at least $60 to $80.
5333984	5335707	It was, like, I was, like...
5335687	5336448	No.
5337009	5360226	No.
5360206	5383362	the um the the replica machine is all Tron Ares branded in red and shit and if the movie if if that movie is crap then I'm not gonna buy it because I don't want to sell I will remember Tron the way I remember it with the original and legacy I don't need this new one so but I'm I'm gonna give it a fair shot I'm trying very hard not to be biased on my way in the door
5383797	5387282	They're already saying that movie's going to flop.
5387302	5388985	They're already saying that movie's going to flop.
5389005	5389906	And I'm like... I don't know.
5390006	5391148	It sounds interesting.
5391268	5395835	I don't like Jared Leto, but, like, Gillian Anderson's in it, and there's, like, other people that are in it.
5396035	5398139	So, like, you know, he'll offset.
5398579	5402806	He's kind of, you know, he's kind of bad.
5402986	5403306	I don't know.
5403567	5404007	We'll see.
5404068	5405029	I mean, like...
5405363	5408450	I'm hopeful that it'll be good, but like... Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying.
5408470	5411737	You're right, Gillian Anderson's in it, and I'll do anything for her.
5411757	5414904	And if that means suffer through Jared Leto, then suffer I shall.
5415626	5416668	Maybe, you never know.
5416688	5423102	Like, sometimes actors, they had a few bad roles, and then they just pick it up, and they like, really...
5423825	5426589	Do well again, you know, maybe that'll happen.
5427050	5427570	Yeah, we'll see.
5427630	5428251	We'll see.
5428311	5430054	Maybe I'm just sucking down the copium.
5430174	5433499	Like, it's just, you know, it could.
5434140	5436784	He can't make bad movies forever.
5436824	5440349	Like, you know, I mean, eventually he's got to make something decent.
5440389	5442872	Like, so it's possible.
5442953	5444635	It's just, I don't know.
5445256	5468698	God, MrBeast better not be in that movie I don't think he is, that's a marketing thing I know it's a marketing thing, but we'll riot if that happens S2100Matt, oh, S2100Matt giving us all the stories tonight No, I love it, I love when we get the participation Asking us about the Tamagotchi-style Pokemon that are on the way out Did you hear about this, Loki?
5469016	5475586	So Takara Tomy and the Pokemon Company, they are pairing up to release Pokemon toys and products.
5476287	5481574	And that includes the Pokemon Pokenade Monster Ball.
5481595	5486021	$50 coming out in Japan on October 11th.
5486041	5488645	And it's similar to Kamigachi.
5489126	5492571	You take care of a Pokemon with the Monster Ball.
5492591	5496897	You can pet the device in order to get different reactions from the Pokemon inside.
5496877	5518564	Pikachu, Eevee,
5518544	5522268	Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, Lucario, Sylveon.
5522288	5524170	So I wonder if it's just like Gen 1 and those.
5524250	5524550	I don't know.
5524570	5525692	Oh no, it says all nine regions.
5525712	5529636	You know, if I just would fucking read what's coming up, I would get it all.
5529676	5532238	So it's a mix of the different regions.
5532639	5534741	It looks cute, but $50?
5534781	5535242	$50?
5536843	5547574	Yeah, according to the other story that was linked in chat there regarding those Tron Ares things, they estimate that the cost would be the $40 to $60 for the... For the machine?
5547615	5548095	Yeah.
5548328	5550050	No, for like any of the buckets.
5550670	5551831	But I can see that.
5551911	5554974	Yeah, it's about what it, like I said, it's what those end up ranging.
5555014	5559038	They're a lot higher than you would think that they should be because they're like, oh, it's a collector's item.
5559058	5561420	But it's like, if I put popcorn in it.
5561440	5566144	Well, no, if I buy one, I'm going to say, can you just give me the, I just want the bucket.
5566405	5567446	I don't want popcorn in it.
5567466	5570668	And I know, I know I would not be the first person to ask for it that way.
5570689	5575693	Like, there are plenty of people who get the popcorn buckets because they are collectibles.
5576053	5577495	So, yeah.
5577515	5577795	Yeah.
5579092	5580654	Anyway.
5580674	5581074	All right.
5581695	5584438	Well, if you don't have any other stories, I think we've hit the end of the show.
5585900	5586421	There it is.
5586741	5587402	That's it.
5587422	5587883	We're done.
5588403	5591627	But we'll be back next week, of course, to talk about the latest and greatest in games.
5591667	5597354	DarkSakura will be back with us next week, and we'll talk all about the latest and greatest going on in games and more.
5597434	5598735	Maybe we'll get some new news next week.
5598755	5603421	Maybe there will be a direct to really rocket launch the news this week.
5603461	5604222	We'll see.
5604202	5631120	Thank you, PodCulture, who reminded me that before our next show...
5631100	5653547	DarkSakura's doing a little subathon to help her raise money for her TwitchCon expenses that is coming up on the 13th and she would appreciate a follow a like, a bit a sub, and all of those it is September, so subs are even cheaper so check that out as well and I think that's all I have to say except for asking Loki first final thought tonight, Loki, your final thought
5654135	5661331	My final thought is, hopefully I'll post a stream schedule or something this week.
5661572	5661893	We'll see.
5661933	5663035	I have to figure out what I'm doing.
5663055	5667425	Because even though I'm taking time off, kids are still in school and the coordinator and all that stuff.
