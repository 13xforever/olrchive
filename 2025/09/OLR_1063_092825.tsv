10696	35404	Thank you for watching!
39046	41909	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41969	46313	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46333	56423	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live tonight, September the 28th of 2025 with episode number 1063 of our show.
56883	58325	My name is Rob Roberts.
58385	62389	I'm here with you every week with my co-host to talk about video games.
62529	66032	Let's say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66788	68536	Hello, DarkSakura.
68556	70785	I hope you're doing well.
70805	71629	I'm doing okay.
71930	74200	I've been kind of tired all weekend.
74382	75223	I hear that.
75703	80508	I was venting before the show that I was supposed to be in LA originally this weekend.
81609	85213	But I ended up going to Vegas somewhat unexpectedly for work.
85574	86975	I only found out about it two weeks ago.
87275	88937	And I had a great time for my work world.
88957	91420	I had nothing to do with games or this program.
92000	94343	And you would think, oh, Las Vegas, it's going to be fun and games.
94563	95584	I mean, it was nice.
95764	99448	The accommodations and the conference were very nice, but it's a lot.
99728	101470	And Vegas is very...
101450	103433	It's kind of pricey, right?
103494	105958	If I want to eat a decent meal there, it's a bit of money.
106579	108743	And I had a good time, but it was tiring.
108763	112830	It's very tiring because you're at a conference and it's paying attention, networking, all that good stuff.
113471	124690	And my God, if I had done LA this weekend, because the Rocky Horror 50th convention was supposed to be in LA this weekend, and I really wanted to go, but sometimes you just have to recognize like...
125075	128279	If I overdo it, I'm going to be really hating life.
128460	130082	So I did not end up going.
131724	132505	Yeah.
133026	143580	Well, what I was also going to add to my how am I doing is I have a lot to get done.
143620	148567	I have a presentation for my boss's boss's boss on Tuesday that I haven't made.
149167	149648	Uh-oh.
150100	152563	Well, I mean, making the presentation is going to be easy.
152723	156728	I just have a lot of background that I've already done.
156748	157529	I've done all my research.
157549	161733	I just have to pretty much show what it's going to look like.
162675	166499	And then I have to do repairs on my pig costume before TwitchCon.
168481	175990	And I am effectively losing 28 hours this week because of Yom Kippur.
176645	186283	and I gotta get an oil change on my car and I have a slow leak in one of my tires and yeah,
187327	189711	I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but I've got to do it.
191133	199385	Oh, I'm sorry to hear what it rains and pours, but I hope after your week of busyness you get a rainbow, because after every rainstorm comes a rainbow.
199445	200987	So I hope there's a rainbow in your future.
201709	206896	If my rainbow comes in the form of a pile of dark chocolate Dubai chocolate, then okay, sure.
207277	208018	I'm down.
208994	211821	Well, if I'd known when I was in Vegas, maybe I could have grabbed one.
211841	212282	Who knows?
212302	213324	I can get it in town.
213385	214447	It's not a problem.
214467	221805	In fact, you can get it now at the grocery store, at HomeGoods, pretty inexpensively.
222157	227245	Before I get to Loki, SJ100Matt says, Yeah, I heard it's pricey and also empty in Vegas now.
227445	229969	I didn't find it to be that empty, actually.
230069	238521	I wouldn't say it was crowded, especially for the middle of the week, but for the middle of the week, I was like, there's a decent amount of people here.
239703	241566	I went to...
241546	243929	Hello, Loki!
244530	268583	Hello, Loki!
269423	269703	Hello.
270044	272106	Are you wearing a Journey t-shirt like the band?
272447	273688	I am wearing a Journey t-shirt.
273708	274369	Amazing.
274389	274809	I love it.
274970	278754	And you've got, this must be the new Sonic Racing Crossworlds playing behind you.
279715	281597	Yeah, it's a game I haven't picked up yet.
281998	283640	You know what I did?
283980	284521	I did.
284541	289287	I bought it and it's supposed to arrive today, but they keep pushing back the time.
289327	290969	It's like, oh, it's out for delivery.
290989	294773	And I just saw an email pop in that says...
294753	295735	Oh no, it says delivered.
295755	296617	I thought it said delayed.
296717	297699	Oh shit, it's downstairs.
298060	301947	I need to turn it over to somebody and run downstairs and get it before the porch thief does.
301967	304753	So my copy of Sonic is literally sitting downstairs right now.
305054	306677	I thought it said delayed when I looked at my watch.
306717	307519	I was like, oh, here we go.
307919	308821	No, they just delivered it.
308841	309302	So that's nice.
309342	310424	PlayStation 5, Bobby.
310765	312188	This is the version I got.
312353	313555	Um, okay.
314156	314837	Uh, let's see.
314997	315899	Loki, what else I want to ask you?
315939	319565	Oh, you were, so have you had a screen break today?
319685	321889	I feel like you've been streaming all day.
321909	324373	Cause I saw you, I saw you this morning.
324413	327038	You were doing what you were doing peak or something this morning.
327058	332587	And then I saw you were doing like mafia, the traitors, blood on the clock tower, that thing.
332607	334770	And I asked you just before we went live, did you win?
334790	335712	And you said.
336451	336791	Yes.
337072	337593	You won!
337673	337973	I did.
338073	338955	Congrats!
338975	341458	And you were a filthy, dirty, scummy traitor, right?
342239	344543	I was a filthy, dirty, scummy imp, yes.
344883	345404	Same thing.
345484	348489	Were you by yourself, or did you have other people that won?
348509	349029	I had minions.
350051	350612	I had minions.
351112	352274	We had minions.
352314	356400	We had a wraith and a fearmonger.
356920	363871	I don't know the Blood on the Clocktower version, but I am assuming it is just a derivative of Werewolf slash Mafia slash The Traitors.
363931	364573	It's similar.
364793	365734	Okay, okay.
365754	367738	What I watched, I did watch a little bit.
367758	373427	I was lost because I came in midway, but I was like, well, Loki's still there and there's less seats at the table than were in the preview.
373897	397828	it is yeah it well yeah the preview the preview it starts off i think you can have like a max of like 15 or so people in there and then as it when we close the game then it obviously all the seats go away but yeah it's it is uh you see you weren't able to follow a lot of it i wasn't able to follow a lot of it either so i was relying on the people that have played that were playing with me to like
397927	399589	You know, hey, what we got to do?
399669	405978	Because like one of them is a lunatic is what their thing is and what their ability.
406078	407400	Now, that's not nice, Loki.
407420	408881	That's not nice.
408922	415931	What the ability means is they think that they're the bad guy, but they're not.
415951	417212	They're just they're a lunatic.
417273	420677	So like they they will like say, oh, we want you.
420657	445956	I want to kill this person and then the game master tells me the lunatic wants to kill this person and you can either go with that or you can do something else so like you I for the first couple rounds I played it as you know oh yeah you are the evil one and so we would just kill the person that they want until it became you know there was one person that was starting to you know poke their nose in the places and so we had to take them out
446003	446684	I see.
446704	447205	All right.
447265	450409	Sounds like it's maybe worth going back and watching.
450429	453895	Even if I spoiled the ending, it still might be worth going back and watching.
453915	455937	Yeah, Legundo's stream.
456038	461245	I didn't record my perspective from it because it's weird to watch it from my perspective.
461405	463468	He's got the whole game board.
463489	466313	You can kind of see everybody and stuff.
466393	468636	It's a lot easier to do it that way.
468785	488194	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
488174	494488	every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
494909	497114	Bobby is in chat right now, as he sometimes is.
497134	497615	Thank you, Bobby.
497956	500261	With some comments, and y'all can comment along with the show.
500983	503829	Asking, oh, excuse me, what did you use to play it?
503849	506014	Tabletop Simulator or something else?
506450	510659	Yeah, because for those who don't know, Blood on the Clock Tower is an actual tabletop game.
511441	513426	So they have a dedicated app.
513506	515290	I don't know if it's tied in with the company.
515310	519740	I think it is because I registered on the wrong site, registered for the board game site.
519880	522145	And then I went back to the correct app.
522165	523969	It's like, oh, you already have an account here.
523949	551222	um so it's botc.app is the the place you can go and you can host your own games there and stuff like that it's all free um and we're checking out though it's it's kind of fun you can do like public games private games and that type of thing you can there's also like they call them scripts that you can set up your own custom classes and it gets very it's already complicated and gets even more complicated uh if you want it to be but yeah that's where I did it through
551422	555190	Alright, let's go ahead and get into some gaming news.
555250	559859	We'll talk about what went down at the Tokyo Game Show, specifically with Microsoft.
559879	563727	Loki, I'll turn it over to you while I run downstairs and get what's waiting for me.
564483	570473	Yeah, we had lots of new trailers for things as well as some new looks at things.
570973	578265	So one of the first trailers that we got was for Gungrave Gore, Blood Heat.
578285	581190	And I don't remember Gungrave too much.
581310	585597	I thought that was on the Xbox 360 originally or one version was.
585577	599535	um Gun Gray VR was another one I know that came out uh not that long ago but yeah it's it's been a while since we've got that game but it looks really cool um very like you know action-packed and everything um
600646	603811	Very much looking forward to playing that whenever it comes out over here at some point.
604492	614427	We got a first look at another look at 007 First Light, which is the new 007 game by IO Interactive.
615409	621338	And I guess highlighting Gemma Chan, a new character in the game.
621453	641925	We got a trailer for, I think this has been revealed before, Double Dragon Revive Looks like a pretty awesome, kind of like what they did with Streets of Rage recently Where they kind of remade it and everything It looks pretty awesome with the modern graphics and stuff I'm a big fan of Double Dragon, so it would be kind of fun to check that out
641905	646955	That's coming out actually on all systems on October 23rd, so right around the corner.
647076	654190	And I forgot to mention, First Light is actually going to be out March 27th of next year.
654250	659301	Then we got Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Butterfly remake.
659321	662968	And so that's going to be coming out early next year.
663353	676932	Um, this, which looks very similar to, I don't even know if this is like a mobile game or something like that, but, uh, Animo, it's a, like a, kind of a Pokemon, Digimon looking game.
677633	680117	And, um, that's something that's going to be coming out.
680157	680577	I don't know.
680597	681919	I think next year at some point.
682743	685510	Sudden Strike 5.
685550	692987	It's a looks like a strategy game, a real time tactic strategy game with an armored train.
693328	694491	That's kind of cool looking.
695838	698163	We had an update for Fallout 76.
698383	704656	I'm talking about, I guess, like some Japanese player updates.
704997	705538	I don't really know.
705578	710348	It says new features added this year, so I don't really know.
710869	713654	Oh, and showcasing some of the camps built by Japanese players.
713875	714817	That makes more sense.
714837	714977	Mm-hmm.
716071	734670	Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection
735578	736940	Looks neat.
736960	743249	This is, I mean, Hitman's doing all sorts of weird stuff, but now we have Hitman, World of Assassination.
743950	747896	Bruce Lee is your partner against the dragon.
748938	749439	Okay.
751462	752543	I mean, why not?
752563	753985	Bruce Lee's badass.
754045	754987	Put him in everything, right?
755568	756569	I want Bruce Lee Roy.
760275	762237	But yeah, apparently Bruce Lee's going to be in the game.
762358	762478	Okay.
762498	762598	Okay.
763709	765092	I'm not sure when.
765192	768679	Oh, that's coming out September 25th through November 20th.
768920	769942	You can play that for free.
770583	771084	Oh, that's right.
771104	772807	Hitman always does the limited time shit.
772928	777196	Like you can only because like they didn't think they had a they had a James Bond one recently.
777216	780262	I don't think you were actually James Bond, but maybe it was one of the villains.
780343	782828	It was Casino Royale and it was the.
783008	783970	Oh, because it was Mads.
783990	784992	It was Mads Mikkelsen.
784972	809190	Mads Mikkelsen, yeah yeah and but that and that was a limited time thing so I don't I mean I don't understand or I don't say I know everything going on in the Hitman series but I just think that's interesting it's all limited time yeah we got a look at a game called Hotel Barcelona and looks pretty good it's a new game from Swery and Suda51 I mean say no more
810942	823382	Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake they showed off some new content for the game that didn't appear in the original called The Ocean Floor and that's coming out October 30th
824155	825477	This looks neat.
825797	826699	Rhythm Doctor.
827540	829342	It's coming out December 6th.
829483	831525	It is a one-button rhythm game.
831726	832847	That looks interesting.
832867	834109	It's very stylish, right?
834530	836893	Trying to go for like a niche sort of style thing.
836913	845025	But I like that they're directly addressing what keeps a lot of people away from modern video games is there's too damn many buttons.
845145	846427	There's too damn many buttons.
846987	851614	So the fact that it's a one-button game, well, you're out of excuses now.
853383	854344	I just don't have rhythm.
856327	857068	Sorry.
857088	857328	Sorry.
858810	862535	Microsoft Flight Simulator World Update Japan.
863036	865960	That's going to be coming out very soon.
866681	869385	And yeah, it looks awesome.
869805	871067	I need to check out Flight Sim again.
871087	877095	2024 did not hit the same way that the original reboot, which I think was 2020 or 2021, did.
877075	879638	It did not hit the same for me.
879658	884564	And I think because they just it was just a little easier to just get in and go in the original.
884664	885725	So thank you.
885845	886866	Bobby confirms this 2020.
888047	894735	So I didn't love that about 2024, but I feel like there were a lot of people saying 2024 was not on the same level as 2020.
895035	897618	So I'm hoping by now they've kind of fixed some of that.
897799	898659	I'll have to check it out.
898680	902644	Thankfully, I'm almost positive that's one of those games you can play on the cloud.
902624	930724	so I don't have to download like 200 gigabytes to see I could just do a little test run and see like oh they fixed the problems I was having with it so but this new content sounds neat too of course being able to look at Japan and Super HD and just Flight Simulator I mean the funny thing is I would still recommend the 2021 I would still recommend the 2021 because it's just so damn good like it and everything just looks beautiful in that game so
931548	960913	Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven is finally coming to Xbox this game got remade back in 2024 came out on everything else but now it's finally coming on Xbox well better late than never I guess Star Sand Island a cutesy looking game coming out on February 1st as well as on Playstation and PC and it is a life sim game
961788	989652	and it looks just like you know your harvest moons and all that what else uh project evil bane um not really sure what this is but it looks neat it's a four player they have a four player co-op missions and giant bosses and all that stuff so they're coming out later half of 2026 uh we got a new look at ninja gaiden 4 uh looks pretty awesome and that's um
990408	1008265	MissFall Hunters
1008852	1033172	uh Winter Winterboro we've seen this one before uh the like mouse survival um game it looks kind of cozy and stuff but uh I guess that's also coming to Xbox on November 12th we've got a Terminal Brigade uh Cross Evangelion so we're gonna be some content involved with that um
1034047	1035371	I have no idea what that game is.
1035471	1039000	I know what Evangelion is, but yeah, should be interesting to see.
1040364	1043713	It looks like it's based on the newer ones, the movies.
1044615	1049288	Ah yes, it's been remade so many times I don't even know what's different with it.
1050280	1051181	I'll have to check it out.
1053985	1057650	Age of Mythology, Retold, Heavenly Sphere.
1058551	1066622	That's going, I guess, coming to Xbox, PlayStation 5 and PCs just this week, actually.
1067022	1068144	September 30th.
1069005	1070787	And yeah, it looks pretty cool.
1071728	1097247	Black Ops 7 Black Ops 7 Black Ops 7
1097513	1100077	Yeah, I'm thrilled for Forza Horizon 6.
1100177	1104804	It's one of the reasons to be in Microsoft's infrastructure.
1104884	1106806	Although it is interesting.
1106847	1114257	I mean, it will inevitably come to PlayStation at this point, as many of their other games like Flight Simulator and some of those others have been.
1114277	1119645	So, you know, you could always wait it out, but especially with the prices of Xboxes.
1119665	1121007	But that's, you know, we got it.
1120987	1122588	Yeah.
1122608	1127753	Well, I mean, we kind of talked about the big one last week and all the tariffs now that's affecting it.
1128033	1138863	So I think people are – I think it's very smart of Microsoft to be releasing their games on other platforms because at this point people, at least in the States, aren't going to be buying platforms.
1138923	1142967	I mean in Japan, Microsoft has always been an underdog.
1143427	1149593	So I'm curious if this moves the needle for them at all, not just Forza but all these sort of –
1149573	1152602	I gotta think of a better word than pandering, but let's say marketing.
1152783	1162232	No, I think it could because car culture is pretty popular over there as well, so I can imagine now setting something in your homeland as
1163208	1183208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1183880	1185342	I was kind of surprised.
1185422	1192252	I don't know, maybe because my perception was screwed up because I was out of town, so I didn't get to follow this stuff live.
1192653	1195337	But I was kind of surprised that, well, maybe I shouldn't be.
1195557	1200204	I mean, it's not like Tokyo Game Show is a little show or anything, and that we don't have E3 anymore.
1200585	1204030	I guess maybe I was a little surprised that this is where they chose to announce Forza.
1204450	1206934	I don't feel like it got as much.
1206914	1229057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1229037	1232162	We had a big game release last week and this week.
1232242	1243000	I just bought... By the way, I thought somebody had stolen this from the porch because the email came after Alan left, but he had actually brought it inside.
1243020	1245884	They don't ring the doorbell, so you must have just seen the shadowy figure through the wall.
1246225	1250171	But my Sonic Crossworlds racing is here, so yay.
1250211	1251113	I'll be playing that later.
1251173	1252936	Maybe a stream tomorrow if I feel up to it.
1253897	1255500	But...
1255852	1284660	there's that, and then I bought Final Fantasy Tactics as well, which is supposed to get here on Tuesday so it's a, and then Silent Hill F, I actually passed on for now, but I'm starting to go shit, maybe I do need to pick that up too, because apparently Silent Hill F is getting a really warm reception some people say it's better than the 2 remake and that I, one of my friends on Blue Sky who loves Silent Hill games said this is the best one since 3 and that's quite high praise for F from the fandom, so
1284640	1286863	We just need to know what Shane thinks.
1287624	1288906	I haven't been able to ask him.
1289648	1293313	He's on a journey right now.
1293894	1295156	Not to be confused with your shirt.
1295216	1297219	He's in New Zealand right now.
1297279	1300964	I don't know if he had a chance to pick up the game or even play it.
1301025	1302286	I guess I could text and find out.
1302347	1303608	They're five hours behind.
1304249	1304510	We'll see.
1304530	1305752	He ignored my text yesterday.
1306693	1307975	I think that was a time zone thing.
1308616	1309898	I'll message and see.
1311240	1311340	Okay.
1311607	1335792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1335772	1341732	I'm just a little surprised they waited, but I don't think it changes the reception of the game at the end of the day.
1341812	1343317	Come on, it's a Forza Horizon game.
1343357	1344140	It's going to be huge.
1344822	1348093	I'm very curious how...
1348512	1351215	or when it releases because they said next year, right?
1351615	1353757	But they didn't say fall.
1353797	1354578	It could be spring.
1355239	1361745	And part of me was wondering if they aren't going to maybe mix up because there should have been a new Forza this year.
1362085	1368732	I'm using my quotey fingers, but maybe with everything going on, you know, or, you know, just development issues, they delayed it a little bit.
1369052	1372055	So maybe it comes out in spring and then maybe Fable.
1372675	1374317	Because Turn 10 is making Fable.
1374297	1399140	Forza series is gone oh yeah the mainline Forza games those folks got laid off I'm sorry to say I believe so I don't think we're gonna get another one of those because I think Horizon's been the game that's been getting more attention for years now anyway ever since probably the second game maybe even the first game the Horizon series is kind of the star in that it's like the Yakuza games are all like a dragon now
1399424	1404977	I'm surprised, well, yeah, I'm surprised that, like, Gran Turismo hasn't gone that route.
1405037	1410310	I know Gran Turismo is, like, super sim, like, but I'm surprised they haven't tried to.
1410370	1411793	That's a really good call-out.
1411813	1416825	I know it's very scalable, too, but, like, I'm surprised they, they're live service now, so I guess that's
1417227	1435489	It's own thing, I guess.
1435469	1451813	It were to also go the more arcadey, controlled kind of route, I don't know, for lack of a better term, I think there would be a lot of people would be very upset because there definitely is a crowd that wants the sim games and is probably mourning the loss of Forza because it only leaves Gran Turismo at this point.
1452374	1462829	So if Gran Turismo were to also go away or turn into, you know, Gran Turismo Horizon, for lack of a better term, there would be a crowd of people would be really, really sad about that.
1462849	1464852	I'm surprised, though, because I think
1465523	1471910	Uh, Forza Horizon, like, I know that it skews more arcade-y, but I think you can tune it to be, like, as realistic as you want.
1471930	1474714	Well, yeah, but it's all the, um, assists, right?
1474734	1479559	You could, you could turn Forza Horizon into a one-button game, like that rhythm game you were talking about.
1479579	1483824	You could just have one button, the accelerator, and I, I don't even think you necessarily need that.
1483864	1487228	You can turn all these assists on and off and stuff, so...
1487208	1516827	or there was that other game I don't know if that was still Gran Turismo I was trying to think back when the PlayStation VR 1 came out like they had like some sort of racing game that was yeah I think that was Gran Turismo let me get to a couple other comments from chat here over twitch.tv slash VOG Network SSJ100Matt on Forza Horizon 6 says the developers were saying that the Hot Wheels DLC helped them come up with some concepts for Tokyo's elevated highways for the game that's kind of interesting
1517971	1541295	yeah um let's see other comments going back to Silent Hill F um basically more positive reception Quest Buster says two relatively big horror streamers I've watched before really like it uh Bobby Blackwolf says an eternal enigma friend of the network has also who I know plays a lot of Silent Hill and speed runs it has been liking it so I think I call it Haslans playing it too um
1541275	1543919	Oh yeah, Haslan's super into Silent Hill.
1543939	1544440	Yeah.
1544700	1544960	Yeah.
1545221	1549727	I saw Jeff Brutlag, who I follow on social media for a long time.
1549747	1551890	He was also playing and really enjoying it.
1551910	1552451	I'm following him too.
1552671	1552912	Yeah.
1553553	1554814	So.
1554835	1555395	It's pretty cool.
1555415	1556617	Are you getting a Silent Hill?
1557779	1560883	I want it, but I've got other expenses right now.
1561043	1561444	Fair.
1562285	1589946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1590533	1592717	Well, like I said, I was playing Avatar.
1592737	1597464	I've been doing that on Friday because I want to finish the last DLC.
1598085	1601551	It's a really beautiful area, the Clouded Spire.
1602633	1608523	And I'm super enjoying it, but it's definitely requiring a skill bump.
1608583	1611748	There's like new things that you can do with it.
1611728	1636808	so um but but but it's fun it's really fun and I enjoyed the the story a whole lot and I like that it is canon so it it sort of lets it's very immersive I'll put it that way um so other than that of course there's been Dead by Daylight um I got my adepts for V and the Kasu um
1638020	1645083	and I'm trying for Houndmaster and I was one short because this person just got away at the last minute.
1646869	1649177	Also, the dog is stupid.
1649663	1669562	and I tried Dracula earlier but I'm not doing too great with either of them I'm getting better, I'm learning them better but I'm afraid it's going to take my MMR dipping eventually for me to get them I played a lot of Pig games and did really great with Pig until I got tired
1669542	1679458	Um, um, also, uh, I'm playing, uh, the Saturn, uh, Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight or as we got it Symphony of the Night, except we didn't get it.
1680319	1692158	Um, my, uh, my version is a translation that has the audio from the, uh, PSP version, um, and the dialogue, but you know, whatever, whatever
1692678	1709472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1709452	1710814	and says, thank you!
1710954	1714099	He goes, arigato gozaimasu.
1714119	1716403	So, it's funny.
1716423	1718165	I saw you playing a little bit of that, actually.
1718906	1724675	Because I wanted to check that out, so I saw one of your shoutouts on Blue Sky and I was like, oh, I want to see that.
1724695	1727319	And you were in the Ice Caverns area, which I don't remember.
1727339	1729282	It's been so long since I played the games, I don't even remember.
1729322	1730284	Whale Underground.
1730404	1731005	Yeah.
1731025	1738176	Well, I had completely blanked on how to get my double jump, and then I remembered...
1738763	1758038	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1758018	1759681	That one's coming up.
1760242	1772522	So when I play next, I'm going to be going to get the Spike Breaker armor so that I can go talk to Maria and get the silver ring so that I don't go jump down Richter's throat.
1772562	1775267	I fight Shaft instead and all of that.
1775247	1779812	I'm not even going to bother doing the crappy, oh god, Richter's dead ending.
1780413	1781054	Because it's stupid.
1782696	1784738	And I have played a little Bellatro.
1786060	1789464	I played... What the crap else did I play?
1791186	1792928	I looked at Minecraft and then closed it.
1793629	1797614	Because that stupid curse launcher keeps opening every damn time.
1797934	1799316	So I finally got rid of that.
1800036	1803060	I didn't uninstall it, I just turned it off of my login items.
1803243	1806449	Oh yeah, Curse Forge, yeah.
1806589	1808052	And Steam does the same crap.
1808894	1819594	So everyone who is on a Mac, you can go into your system settings and go to your launcher login items and you can disable things there.
1819674	1823040	For anyone that is on a PC, you have a...
1823020	1834228	I think that's got all of the launchers for everything that loads when your computer does and absolutely removing stuff from there will help you with a faster startup.
1835440	1845493	Anyway, so yeah, and of course, I keep saying Palia, but it's been officially said Palia, which is stupid.
1847074	1860471	So I've been playing Palia, and I have Ormus, and so I've decided that all of my Ormus are being named after my old Taran characters in WoW.
1862354	1865177	So I have Mukau, M-U-U-K-A-U.
1866085	1875322	and now I have Moonbeam and I had Moo Moo.
1875843	1879570	If you run out of names, you can name one sassy pants for me.
1879590	1880272	But that's a dwarf.
1881073	1882035	It was also a tauren.
1882075	1883217	I had two sassy pants.
1884901	1885282	We'll see.
1885302	1886904	I'm keeping it the moo theme.
1887124	1887525	All right.
1887545	1891491	And so all of my truffets are named after pork dishes.
1892192	1893574	So they're completely not kosher.
1894996	1896878	So far, I have chicharrones.
1897920	1899843	I have trotters and chorizo.
1901746	1905050	And then my peckies, which are all like the chicken things, are pecky something.
1905090	1906112	So I have like peckysaurus.
1906152	1907033	I have pecking duck.
1907594	1908515	I have pecking order.
1909537	1913102	I have what was my favorite?
1913369	1914831	Oh, Pecorino Romano.
1917033	1919256	So, I'm having fun with it.
1919316	1920257	Just trying to get through.
1920277	1923361	I mean, it's gotten a little bit stale, I'll be honest.
1923381	1929709	But I want to get money saved up in games so I can get another property because I have ideas.
1930850	1933854	So, it's been my creative outlet.
1935496	1940182	And other than that, just cosplay shit getting together, man.
1940863	1941283	It's...
1942883	1944328	I need more me.
1947017	1949004	So yeah, I need more me.
1950329	1951473	All right.
1951493	1953440	Well, let's go to Loki.
1953500	1954463	How was your gaming week?
1954966	1974122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1974102	1977790	I don't know, it's been like three hours already of streaming.
1978732	1991942	So I started off this morning with an event that was through Creators Kingdom, and it's basically, it was a peak tournament for the...
1991922	1995005	Palisade Children's Relief Fund.
1995025	1996907	And we raised quite a bit of money.
1996927	1998068	It was like, I think, $1,600.
1998108	1999570	Hey, nice.
1999590	2000591	Which is pretty awesome.
2000811	2001171	That's great.
2001372	2005516	And so they're going to be doing that now a little bit more often.
2005756	2008359	I think it's supposed to be like twice a year or something like that.
2008619	2013084	How did you do for a game I've never heard you talk about playing on this program?
2013804	2014745	I've played Peak before.
2015026	2018829	I've played Peak like three times.
2018849	2019911	Did you get to the top?
2020872	2021132	No.
2021312	2021372	No.
2021909	2025293	No, so I got further than I did before.
2026174	2028177	We had some stuff glitch out.
2028257	2034624	There was an issue with a vine in the jungle area where you couldn't move on it.
2034645	2039791	So I kept trying to get off of that vine, and then it just drained all my stamina and dropped me.
2040672	2048281	And I had my friend have the same thing happen to him as well on that same vine.
2048301	2050684	And then later on in the kiln,
2051828	2060746	We kind of got split up a bit and so they were like climbing way up this thing and I just I went the wrong way and I slipped and then I fell in the lava.
2061788	2068301	But what really kind of sunk us because we had two pretty strong players that were playing.
2068742	2073972	One of them accidentally launched themselves with a cannon into the lava and then that was it.
2075200	2093209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2093189	2098436	Telling you guys earlier, I've been trying to get into this Minecraft event space for a while.
2098456	2104484	And so there are some people that have different private discords that they do all their events out of.
2104504	2113936	Basically, you get invited to these discords, they host an event, and they pull their players from those who are in that discord.
2113956	2117641	And so this week, I've been trying to get into all these.
2117781	2121606	And this week, I got invited to three of them all at once.
2121626	2122487	And so...
2123733	2151327	and DarkSakura.
2151678	2180908	it's a social deduction game where you have groups of people who are taking different roles and you're supposed to be talking with each other to figure out and narrow down what roles people have based off of how they behave and also what they tell you they call it the three by three so you have three roles that you could be that you tell people I also ended up being the villain in the game
2180888	2184372	So, I had three fake rules that I was telling people that I was.
2185894	2187676	But yeah, it's a lot of, like, fun.
2187696	2189298	It can get really complicated and stuff.
2189318	2193963	But yeah, we ended up winning our first game because we took out enough people, I guess.
2194544	2197187	And also because I was able to play off, like, I don't know what I'm doing.
2197267	2198769	And it'd be technically true.
2198789	2199850	I didn't know what I was doing.
2200270	2202593	But also, like, it helped, like...
2204159	2217595	Thank you for watching!
2218267	2219569	But yeah, it was fun.
2219589	2222755	So hopefully we'll get to do more of that type of stuff in the near future.
2223256	2228485	Not on the same day, though, like this is a bit much, you know, streaming, you know, now it's gonna be like six hours today.
2228565	2232913	So good for you getting out there networking more, though, because I know you've been trying.
2232933	2235718	Yeah, I know you've been a little frustrated with the kind of
2235698	2259478	Networks is a good thing.
2259610	2276573	uh okay uh my gaming week it's you know obviously I had a work trip in the middle of the week so and there's no no there's no Vegas gaming stories or that sorry um but I um I did still play Final Fantasy 11 because I'm still on that cat's eye server because my friends are still there too
2276553	2280158	Really having a good time, and we've been doing quests together.
2280178	2287306	I finally unlocked Corsair this weekend, which is my favorite job in XI, and it's also a pain in the ass to get.
2287387	2289409	I forgot how fucking long that quest is.
2289429	2291772	You have to take a boat, and then you have to take another boat.
2292012	2299922	But anyway, I got Corsair, and I got it leveled up to 30 already, just because the XP rates on the server are disgusting, and with trust and everything, it makes it easy.
2299942	2301845	But I'm having fun just playing that with friends.
2301865	2304568	So that's been the bulk of my gaming week.
2304548	2320347	Diablo 4
2320327	2340546	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2340526	2343451	I also wanted to shout out, I've been playing this phone game.
2343471	2344993	Of course, I've been playing Pokemon Go.
2345113	2352485	Pikmin had a big event this weekend that I've been... I mean, there's not as much to it to say like a GoFest, but I've been trying to get my steps in.
2353006	2357353	And Ingress, I still play here and there.
2357333	2382987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2382967	2404384	and it's the real airplanes so it's it's put on by this website like that actually you can look at flight paths online and stuff and you can actually see the live traffic of the planes in your area so they made a game out of it where you actually are capturing the planes that are flying overhead from where you're at right now and all this stuff so I thought I thought that was a really clever idea what what
2405157	2407341	You're capturing planes?
2410646	2412349	With a Polaroid camera.
2412449	2415154	You are capturing them on film.
2415515	2416536	Capturing them on film.
2416556	2418440	Capturing on film.
2418500	2420383	Excuse me for leaving out a key detail.
2420423	2421926	Not that.
2422006	2423368	Not that.
2423348	2424509	God, no.
2424670	2428174	Capturing on a Polaroid photo is the whole setup.
2429456	2432119	S200Matt says Rob got baited by a shiny.
2432139	2434502	My wife has been baited by the TikTok shot many a time.
2434622	2435023	It happens.
2435083	2436044	It happens.
2436244	2436805	My God.
2436905	2439768	If I can just for a few seconds here.
2439788	2441751	It is the modern day QVC.
2442091	2443433	It is the modern day QVC.
2443413	2449320	I'm going to talk hypothetically like the YouTube algorithm is actually watching this show.
2449580	2452864	Stop showing me goddamn ads for shoes.
2452884	2455166	I don't want orthopedic old people's shoes.
2455467	2459551	Stop showing literally every fucking ad is for shoes.
2460132	2462955	Like, stop sending me the shoe ads.
2463115	2464497	I don't want those shoes.
2464757	2466619	But is the wife looking at shoes?
2466639	2467861	Because that's what happens.
2468061	2468121	No!
2468793	2492995	Okay, somebody else in your house.
2493751	2499060	Yeah, I'm getting the AARP ads, so I'm there with you.
2499260	2507314	I talked about this on a previous episode, how it's like, subscribe and play old Atari classics through AARP, and I was like, literally get off my lawn.
2507996	2508857	But...
2508837	2534507	I will say the one the one that has me figured out that it fucking can't stand it is Instagram because like they've been showing me cute fucking shirts where I'm like god damn that would be a great hosting shirt they show me some cute fucking shit on that app and I'm like ah but I don't I don't give I always make a note of the shop name and I never click on the link I will then like google it on my main computer and do it that way and that's probably why I'm getting the ads but still
2535145	2540323	Yeah, it's... Yeah, I could have... Like, I had the other day, like, I was looking at one.
2540343	2543012	They were trying to sell me...
2543110	2549118	Office shirts, like from the office, like Threat Level Midnight and Prison Mike, which are funny.
2549279	2556789	And then it's the hackers, the hackers movie box art as a shirt.
2556889	2557671	I get that.
2557811	2561596	I don't want it, but it's like 30 bucks and I don't want to pay 30 bucks for it.
2561616	2565081	I get the shirts and I get David Lynch inspired things, which I'm completely fine by.
2565181	2566162	I'm completely fine.
2566503	2569327	If Instagram has me paid, this is David Lynch, super fan.
2569808	2572932	There are far worse things you could call me in this life, so it's fine.
2572912	2574734	or the Paleo Valley Meat Sticks.
2574935	2578359	I have never in my life eaten a meat stick.
2578379	2579661	Stop advertising to me.
2579681	2580442	Like never once.
2581403	2584547	Everybody in chat is showing what they're getting ads for now.
2585108	2587331	Pod Culture says, Loki could be worse.
2587431	2590515	I hit 55 and most of what I'm getting are ads for dick pills.
2591396	2593018	Oh yeah, those happen too.
2593318	2595882	And I do have an ad blocker on my PC.
2595902	2596883	It's just on my phone.
2596903	2597484	I don't.
2597604	2597804	Same.
2597824	2599206	They get me on my phone.
2599186	2600650	I have one on my phone.
2601492	2603217	Loony Bard says, try being female.
2603237	2605884	You get all the crash diet, miracle diets, wonder drugs.
2605985	2608612	I mean, yum, dehydrated beef organs in capsule form.
2609113	2610096	I get those too.
2610457	2612122	I don't get them.
2612683	2613546	I don't get them.
2614308	2615170	Because...
2616652	2621823	First of all, I have targeted advertising turned off everywhere I go.
2622384	2624689	I use Safari, which disables a lot of that.
2625030	2626974	Which I wish they would bring back to desktop.
2626994	2628317	I wish they would bring that back to desktop.
2628537	2628878	I agree.
2628938	2633047	Safari is the superior mobile app.
2633067	2633387	I agree.
2634650	2635572	Well, I mean...
2636058	2638182	feedback.apple.com.
2638403	2644474	But also, I have Adblock Plus on my iPhone.
2644775	2645657	It works just fine.
2646719	2648723	I also have it on my iPad.
2649524	2652329	Of course, I've got it on my Mac.
2652390	2654674	I also have another one called Ghostery.
2654654	2656338	I do not go on Instagram.
2656438	2657861	I do not go on Facebook.
2657881	2663052	So I do not get any targeting from there because those are the biggest offenders for selling your data.
2666179	2670148	I'm just on Blue Sky and Discord.
2670820	2674109	and the lovely thing is Blue Sky doesn't sell you shit, which is great.
2675894	2680006	Discord, I'm not interested in literally any of the quests that you're trying to push up.
2680146	2685100	I don't care what it's for, if it's for a movie, a game, whatever, I don't care.
2686109	2692079	Um, I, I will say the thing, the other thing I wanted to say to Looney Bard's comment is specifically in the diet front.
2692099	2695425	I get all of like, obviously the algorithms figured out I'm diabetic.
2695606	2699092	I get all the fucking Ozempic, Munjaro, all that shit.
2699112	2703139	All, every other ad is some thing that my doctor's never going to prescribe me.
2703159	2708488	So I don't know why I get, or, or I get the, the, I don't know, imported from Mexico ads or whatever they are.
2708468	2713977	I'm surprised I haven't gotten any of those because I've been on Metformin for a month.
2714878	2732265	Somehow this spurned from a conversation about Sky Cards...
2733629	2735794	Oh yeah, because it was a TikTok ad that got me.
2736115	2739544	But yes, you take pictures, fake pictures of planes.
2739845	2742591	And then there's apparently a whole card game you actually play with it.
2742872	2744837	But I just like capturing...
2745138	2747802	with film, the planes.
2747822	2748643	I think it's really fun.
2748783	2750286	I don't even play the card game that's in it.
2750626	2755994	I'm like, I'm like, I don't even know if Misty OLR is still out there listening, but I'm like Misty OLR playing Ingress.
2756014	2757336	Misty OLR playing Ingress.
2757356	2760000	She doesn't bother to like link field.
2760020	2762604	She just gets keys from places she likes.
2762904	2764927	And I'm like, honestly, I get it.
2765048	2766930	Like that's a completely valid thing to do.
2766950	2768773	A virtual, a virtual souvenir collection.
2768953	2769514	That's kind of cool.
2769534	2772799	Or just collecting the banners and stuff like that.
2772863	2788864	Yeah, there's a lot of people that do that too, but Misty just hacks keys from, you know, she's a big train nerd and a complimentary and gets all the keys from train stations around the US, which I think, honestly, that's, I think certain games are whatever you make them out to be.
2788844	2789265	Right?
2789645	2799379	Like sometimes you'll read the person, this person played World of Warcraft to level 70 and only did it the pacifist way where it took them nine months because they never killed a single thing.
2799399	2801442	They only picked herbs to get there.
2801462	2804807	And it's like, that sounds like a really boring way to do it.
2804827	2808973	But at the same time, if that's what brings you joy, who am I to tell you how to play a game?
2809454	2810656	Like games are fun.
2810716	2817906	And if fun to you is different than fun to me, I think the best games have fun interpreted in different ways.
2818561	2846509	so, alright perfect example, my son's been playing Skate 4 or Skate, I guess the remake that they're doing and there's a glitch that you can get launched way up into the air, that's all he does he just does that glitch over and over and it gets launched into space I do kind of do that in some of my games where, like in Dead by Daylight there's apparently one hill you can walk up the side of that just makes you float in mid-air
2846641	2850428	So there's literally a hill you can go die on?
2850448	2853614	No, you just float there and then you can jump down.
2853794	2855958	Next time I'll be sure to say it's a hill I can float on.
2858422	2861528	Do you remember the Space Kaneki thing?
2863094	2880575	There's like a certain way, and this is Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul, nerds, but he's a killer in the game, and if you aim your little tentacle grab thing at one place, you would hit it and jump into orbit, kind of like old Space Billy.
2883118	2886081	I do those on purpose, and I hate when they get patched out.
2886365	2891931	SSJ100 Matt and Rinmari in chat are talking about Foursquare, the old app that you checked into places.
2892271	2893773	They rebranded the game.
2893913	2898979	I don't know why they did this, but they stripped the game element out and they rebranded it as Swarm.
2899399	2901101	So if you actually want to find the game, you got to do it.
2901181	2905726	But the Foursquare part, they were trying to turn into like a Yelp competitor.
2905746	2911933	They would like use the things that people were taking pictures and writing things of and try to turn it into like a city recommender in Yelp.
2911913	2912494	competitor.
2913455	2916599	But it officially has flopped because they actually yanked Foursquare.
2917099	2919342	It was only like two months ago.
2919402	2923367	It was very recent because I was actually on Swarm again for a little bit.
2923707	2927192	Our voiceover guy, Jason, turned me back onto Swarm for a minute.
2927252	2929635	I've kind of fallen off the wagon again, but I was on it for a minute.
2930015	2932238	I think it is now Foursquare Swarm.
2932839	2934100	I think is what they call it.
2934120	2935542	But yeah.
2935522	2940960	I haven't thought of Foursquare in an age when I realized that I do not want people to know where I am.
2940980	2948265	That is like somebody bringing up LiveJournal because, oh no, they didn't is still a thing on LiveJournal after all these years.
2948937	2951920	I still have my LiveJournal account because I have a permanent account.
2952040	2952680	Yeah, me too.
2952700	2954702	I'll never get rid of it either.
2954722	2955583	Bring back LiveJournal.
2956063	2969716	As much as, you know, I don't use it regularly, but that LiveJournal is such an important, like talking about capturing things and photographs, LiveJournal is such an important like 10-year time capsule of my life.
2970456	2977763	And I'm not always proud of it because, God, I read some of the shit I posted on LiveJournal back in the day and I just want to push myself down a flight of stairs.
2977743	2993845	You mean, we met?
2994213	2995955	Yeah.
2996515	2997576	What?
2997796	2998217	Remet.
2998997	3001700	No, I met Alan on LiveJournal.
3001800	3002040	Oh, okay.
3002060	3005023	You're doing the throwback to when we were teens.
3005043	3007045	Yes, remet Alan on LiveJournal.
3007065	3010688	Yeah, but neither one of us remember the teen thing outside of knowing we were both.
3010948	3019456	For those that don't know, Alan and I both went to the same teen leadership thing out in the woods that was only 50 kids or so in a similar organization.
3019856	3021498	We know we were there the same year.
3021538	3022899	We have the same core memories.
3023219	3024220	We do not remember meeting.
3024200	3051321	but then we re-met on LiveJournal
3052533	3076988	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3077288	3078069	I agree with that.
3078089	3079692	I still want to push myself down the flight of stairs.
3079732	3084321	I cannot live in regret and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I like who I am.
3084982	3085803	If I lived in regret.
3088789	3089811	Okay.
3090412	3091954	Sky Cards, cute app.
3092075	3093998	Anyway, let's move on with the show.
3094906	3099316	That had nothing to do with airplanes and everything to do with nostalgia, but I don't care.
3099336	3099697	It's fine.
3100158	3102063	That's how we are.
3102203	3103105	That's how we roll.
3103125	3107075	All right, let's get into some more gaming announcements from another company this week.
3107175	3109320	Loki, we'll go over to you and talk about Sony.
3109688	3124622	Yep, Sony had a State of Play showcase showing off some new game titles as well as announcing stuff coming to their platform from other platforms as we'll talk about here pretty soon.
3125363	3128866	So starting things off, they showed off a trailer for a game called Sorrows.
3130307	3134351	It's a fast-paced momentum-driven shooter.
3135492	3137434	And yeah, it looks...
3137414	3138376	Interesting.
3138396	3142883	That's going to be coming out March 20th on the PlayStation 5.
3142923	3149733	And then we had something for Zero Parades for Dead Spies.
3150394	3151155	I love those titles.
3151176	3153920	Is that like a visual novel game or something?
3153960	3156524	But no, it is a follow-up to Disco Elysium.
3157285	3159569	And that was originally announced at Gamescom.
3160150	3164957	And now, of course, we know it's coming to PlayStation 5 as well as PC.
3164937	3174014	Speaking of games coming to PlayStation that were on other platforms, Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2024 coming to PlayStation 5 on December 8th.
3174735	3175857	So that's pretty cool.
3176759	3187418	And then we've got, of course, a new trailer for the campaign for Battlefield 6, which we know is coming out probably just in a few weeks here on October 10th.
3188292	3193777	Deus Ex being remastered for its 25th anniversary.
3193917	3197761	That's coming to PlayStation 5 as well on February 5th.
3198582	3209172	Also, we got a look at the new Halloween game, which is another asymmetrical horror game, kind of like the Friday the 13th Dead by Daylight type of stuff.
3209352	3210453	It's going to last a month.
3213336	3214097	Like all of them.
3215022	3217244	That's coming out September 8, 2026.
3217264	3219306	Yeah, it should be reminded.
3219727	3222710	So how's Killer Clowns from Outer Space doing?
3223131	3224712	You know, because that was... Killer what?
3224912	3227555	It's still running, which is more than I can say for most of them.
3227896	3236204	Texas Chainsaw is still running too, but they were supposed to switch to a peer-to-peer matchmaking model, which usually is the sign that it's done.
3236224	3238407	Like, they're not going to make any more updates to Texas Chainsaw.
3238687	3240829	But I think the peer-to-peer thing was called off.
3241009	3244573	Alan really liked that game and has...
3245178	3249165	I pretty much held on until the bitter end and kind of know what's going on.
3249907	3253774	If you remember, DVD matches early on, though, were hosted by the killer.
3256799	3257280	Interesting.
3258162	3267439	But anyway, it was always the survivors were always connected to the killer side and then they put out the public queues.
3268077	3274686	I will be curious to see what new thing does Halloween try to bring to this genre?
3274706	3277810	Because if the answer is nothing, then it's dead in the water.
3278170	3279833	It needs to be Laurie Strode with an Uzi.
3280213	3289886	Yeah, I would love to see what Halloween can do new for the genre, but I'll give it a fair shot if it looks like it's something we haven't seen before.
3289906	3290727	So, anyway.
3292158	3298049	Then we got an announcement that Last Epoch is going to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.
3298089	3299712	Right now it's been PC exclusive.
3300273	3306084	As well as the first expansion for the game, Orbis, is going to be launching at the same time on console.
3306425	3315702	The Seven Deadly Sins Origins is going to be getting an open world game based off of the anime that's coming out on PlayStation 5 January 28th.
3315850	3323842	We talked about this last week, I think, for Sonic Racing Crossworlds, that there was going to be Mega Man DLC coming.
3324743	3333335	But we got to look at what that actually looks like, as well as the track itself, which is going to be Dr. Wily's Castle.
3333776	3336320	And I am a fan of that.
3336840	3342128	So that'll be coming, I think, pretty soon, whenever that DLC unlocks.
3342867	3369212	Neo 3 is going to be coming February 6th as well as there's going to be a Dynasty Warriors 3 remaster coming as well as a Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition remaster that's going to be coming March 19th on PlayStation 5 Code Vein 2 got a new trailer and that's going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 January 30th
3370947	3378776	Let's see Final Fantasy Tactics, the Avalanche Chronicles, and that's going to be coming out actually this week.
3379436	3382800	So look for that PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for that one.
3383881	3394093	Let It Die Inferno, which is a sequel to the game by Grasshopper Manufacture, and that is going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 December 3rd.
3394673	3398878	We got a cool looking game, Chronoscript The Endless End.
3399500	3400281	I love that title.
3400862	3409796	It's a side-scroller, The Endless End, the side-scrolling action platform game about a man trapped within the pages of a book.
3409816	3411138	And that's on PlayStation 5.
3411979	3417508	Crimson Desert coming to PlayStation 5 March 19th.
3418484	3425473	We got a weird in the middle of everything, a weird announcement for peripheral that I just don't see a lot of people needing.
3425693	3429398	But if you're in the market for it, Pulse speakers.
3429739	3436508	They are Sony branded speakers that can pivot and they are wireless.
3437008	3442135	And it's compatible with your PlayStation 5, PC, Mac and your PlayStation Portal.
3442155	3445099	And they are available in black or white and coming out next year.
3446800	3447281	Cool.
3448663	3449103	Let's see.
3449303	3452568	PlayStation Plus getting some cool games coming out.
3454150	3464104	We've got The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for Last of Us Day and that is going to be that actually came out back on Friday.
3464144	3475339	Gran Turismo 7 is getting a Spec 3 update in December and include two new tracks, eight vehicles, and data logging as well as much more.
3476500	3486557	And then, although there was no announcement for a new game, God of War 20th Anniversary is getting a DualSense controller that's themed after the game as well.
3487539	3492547	And that is, I don't know when that's coming out actually, but it has a red streak on it.
3492567	3494570	I'm sure they'll find a way to re-release the games.
3495171	3496994	Pay the premium for that, yeah.
3497014	3502103	Finally, last but not least, we got a good look at Without Leaks.
3502083	3507590	Got a good look at the new Insomniac Marvel Wolverine game.
3507650	3508872	And it looks cool.
3508892	3509733	It looks violent.
3510955	3513017	Yep, definitely going to be good.
3513618	3520848	And it is being, I guess, Logan's going to be voiced by Liam McIntyre.
3522049	3523451	The trailer is awesome.
3523872	3525694	Yeah, so that's coming out on PlayStation 5.
3526195	3528558	I think late next year, but we'll see.
3530240	3531702	Yeah, it looks amazing.
3531817	3532858	Yeah, the game looks pretty good.
3532918	3535922	I missed this state of play because it was all happening while I was out of town.
3536683	3540108	And, you know, when you're living in a bubble like that, you just kind of miss a lot of what's going on.
3540148	3545535	But that did look... Yeah, the Wolverine game looks like it's going to bring more people to PS5.
3545635	3546396	Yeah, exactly.
3546436	3548099	There's no reason to think it will be bad.
3548619	3550602	So, awesome.
3550885	3554570	Alright, some little nuggets from Sony there in a surprise state of play.
3554591	3557775	Why can't Insomniac make, like, an Avengers game?
3557895	3559979	Like, I mean, they're already doing a great job with it.
3559999	3564085	They kind of already tried an Avengers game and it didn't... Yeah, but that was with EA.
3564225	3565006	I mean, come on.
3565527	3567730	EA's gonna fuck it up no matter what.
3567710	3569793	Maybe, you never know, Loki.
3569873	3570735	Maybe they said no.
3571256	3574300	Maybe they said we don't want to do a game so big in scope.
3574341	3575562	We don't want to do something at that level.
3576183	3583355	It's very possible game developers get asked to do things and they say, no, we don't think we can bring this to vision the way people would want.
3584356	3587862	I don't remember who made the Avengers game, but yeah, it sucked.
3588668	3590350	All right, I'm going to get into this next story.
3590370	3595736	So this next story is about at least one of the two companies I follow a lot and I talk a lot about on this show.
3595916	3599641	And I am seeing this headline misrepresented in gaming media.
3599661	3611514	So I need to kind of level set and I need to talk about because, and I've said this on the show plenty of times, there is the facts, there's the news, and then there's the truth.
3611995	3616600	And then there is what ultimately guides everybody's reactions, which is the perception.
3616580	3625776	I want to show you an example in this story how perception is leading into fact when it is actually verifiable that it is not fact.
3625876	3627239	What am I talking about?
3627259	3638098	I am talking about what happened with this, which is a story about the Hideo Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary livestream.
3638118	3640221	It was called Beyond the Strand.
3640241	3640562	And as
3640542	3657471	Death Stranding John Hanke
3657451	3669368	who you might know from Niantic who originally developed Pokemon Go before selling that off to Scopely but is still in the business of Ingress, Scanaverse, and the things that make up Niantic Spatial.
3669788	3672151	John Hank, who by the way was the guy behind Google Maps.
3672172	3675997	That's the other big thing he was known for and where Niantic was born in the first place.
3676678	3683307	He came out with Kojima on the stage to announce that there is a collaboration coming.
3683287	3711336	and that has led to headlines that look like this and I'm going to show you a headline from a website that normally I go to for news and find it to be pretty reliable for news and that website is Eurogamer and I'm going to show you the other screen right now so look at the headline on this story would you play a Pokemon Go like geospatial Death Stranding game with smart glasses and your phone Hideo Kojima seems to think you will
3711805	3721019	So suddenly, John Hanke coming out on stage leads to, this is going to be a Death Stranding game that's Pokemon Go.
3721039	3723542	And this is a headline I have seen a lot.
3724624	3725445	That's not how I read it.
3726166	3735680	You might read into this headline several different ways, but I am also seeing the straight up Death Stranding Pokemon Go game coming.
3735760	3738184	I am seeing that headline in other places.
3738164	3745896	But this headline is still saying, would you play a game with Hideo Kojima seems to think you will.
3748458	3753345	All right, we had some live difficulties and we lost the stream for a minute, but we're back and I can continue my thought.
3753725	3758211	So you see in this that they use the word game, that they're saying that it's a game.
3758572	3764299	Well, as it turns out, Niantic actually did an event at Niantic Park.
3764359	3772330	This is coming from a popular Ingress podcast, Ingress Insights, which was actually also broadcast through some of the Ingress channels.
3772410	3776676	Some of this news information, some of the agents on the ground at Niantic Park were
3776656	3797702	The New Cooperation is Not a Game
3797682	3825782	and it's not Ingress specific which remember Niantic Spatial what's left of Niantic has nothing to do with Pokemon Go anymore it has nothing to do with Monster Hunter or Pikmin those are now owned and operated by Scopely that part of the organization split off so to even say Pokemon Go is a little bit because Niantic has nothing to do with Pokemon Go anymore other than the fact that they made it Ingress and Scanaverse are their big apps and Peridot are the big apps that they still run
3825762	3829245	So but regardless, they say this is not a game.
3829265	3833089	So this information with just a little bit of research you can find.
3833109	3838053	But going back to the article, and I want to stress, I usually think this website gets it right.
3838073	3847682	This is not a dragging of Eurogamer because I saw a lot of headlines that were sloppier than this one saying Hideo Kojima to release Death Stranding Go and the social media takes.
3847762	3849684	Oh, it's going to be Pokemon Go, but Death Stranding.
3850004	3853707	Well, no, Niantic has literally come out and said it is not a game.
3854228	3855769	So it's not that.
3855749	3884052	and but you know as part of this piece you know the author says it all looks like stuff from the chiral network in the Death Stranding games so I imagine our job as porters via our phones or smart glasses per the trailer will be to connect things up and that I imagine ends up being the headline this to me this is just reflective and again I'm not trying to drag this one particular website or this author who's probably just doing what they're being asked to do but
3884032	3892586	It's this problem of this headline world that we live in where I imagine or my conclusion is now the headline.
3894049	3896353	And we got to be better than that.
3896373	3904106	And I understand in the age of getting your clicks through social media and all that stuff, your headline has to be catchy.
3904506	3909735	But that doesn't mean you should be jumping to conclusions to get that.
3910357	3917995	Now, for the record, I happen to think that this Niantic and Kojima collaboration, I think they're so close.
3918496	3929361	What I think it will be, and this is just knowing that it's not a game and just following Niantic as long as I have and having an appreciation of Kojima Games' art.
3929341	3946067	I think that one thing that Death Stranding did very well very well with the online was that people could build the bridges and do the thumbs up and leave essentially what were notes for other people I think you might get a Death Stranding
3946047	3969912	and DarkSakura.
3969892	3972496	was kind of what Niantic's very first app was.
3972717	3973558	It doesn't exist anymore.
3973578	3978026	It was called Field Trip way before there even was Ingress, way before there was even Pokemon Go.
3978346	3981732	Field Trip was what that might have looked like 15 years ago.
3982253	3994433	Now with the new technology, now with AR and this branding, I think they could brand that into something that feels a little more exciting and would get people to check it with Hideo Kojima's branding behind it.
3994453	3995595	But I think there is a scent
3995575	4020081	Death Stranding Go Death Stranding Go
4020314	4048144	DarkSakura, I think we're over to you.
4048850	4055779	Yeah, so this is a report coming from Reuters, which, you know, I've never had a problem with anything.
4055879	4056740	I've gotten from there.
4057961	4070537	But there has been some talk, and I've heard it going around from other people saying it too, is that there is talks with EA to go private.
4070517	4073780	Actually, this is a pretty big thing.
4075161	4080507	They're in well-advanced talks to go private for roughly $50 billion.
4081528	4083029	There's a group of investors.
4083590	4099545	Among them are Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, and Jared Kushner's affinity partners are working to make a deal out with EA.
4100858	4117847	It's going to be a lot more consolidation like we've been seeing with Big Company A buying Big Company B and creating a big pancake of games and then closing the studio, closing that studio.
4120311	4121112	It's...
4123538	4145893	There is so much just going on financially, but one of an analyst was quoted saying the EA made sense as an acquisition target, that the cash flows are fairly consistent and EA's annualized titles make for predictable revenue profitability, meaning the sports games.
4148197	4151402	There's... I don't...
4152007	4163282	and the other thing is that Affinity Partners I mean well we know who Kushner is and we know his association and I
4165760	4184224	I don't know, there's just a lot of things I don't feel good about with this I certainly don't, I feel about as good on this as I feel about the TikTok sale which is also a very not good thing I'm also concerned with how many cookie jars in the gaming industry Saudi Arabia has their hands in right now
4184204	4208727	A lot.
4208825	4218895	They want power in some way in EA, FC, and their soccer game, which is... That is the biggest game in the world, if I'm not mistaken, right?
4218915	4220417	There's also a bit more behind it.
4220537	4230507	They have this strategy they're calling Vision 2030, where they're trying to diversify their economy outside of the oil industry.
4232369	4236553	And further from that, they have their...
4238018	4241766	Their whole group there has a gaming arm called Savvy Games Group.
4242588	4251927	And they are trying to increase their influence over what is arguably the largest entertainment industry right now.
4252835	4266443	I don't know.
4266644	4273037	I'm very concerned about all these places that...
4273017	4274219	They're showing up.
4274760	4281754	And I don't know, you would think there'd be a limit to that, but that's not how the world works or the way our capitalist government works.
4282215	4284760	So I don't know what to feel.
4284781	4288067	I do think EA was probably in a little bit of trouble.
4288328	4292055	I think as we've seen from some of their non-sports related titles.
4292035	4307450	I think they've made a lot of mistakes in the industry that a lot of the big gaming companies have made, thinking that they can sell a bunch of crap and people will pre-order it or bust out the game up the ass with microtransactions and those sorts of things.
4307470	4315898	I think they have been making a lot of mistakes that other AAA publishers, not all of them, but other ones have been making, and now I think they're in a precarious position.
4317339	4319922	There's, I think, a lot more to it, though.
4320102	4320382	Oh, sure.
4320442	4321063	I mean...
4321432	4329062	The biggest thing, and this is actually coming from a games professor at NYU Stern School of Business.
4329222	4330764	I'll just read the quote directly.
4330784	4335851	For Saudi Arabia's PIF, the deal would cement games as cultural infrastructure.
4336592	4340217	Assets as critical to global influence as sports or film.
4341412	4344619	That's another aspect of it we need to be considering.
4346041	4350951	I want to read some other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
4352354	4357665	Bobby Blackwell points out EA shareholders could love this, and that's an important thing to remember.
4357645	4377308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4377288	4400832	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4400812	4417926	Questbuster also with some really good comments here in chat saying,
4417906	4427069	Saudis are heavily promoting themselves in the esports space and in other places like the most recent boxing match between Canelo and Crawford.
4427089	4432623	Meanwhile, Tencent continues to slowly build up their own stakes in studios outside of China.
4432643	4433164	So...
4434443	4445100	And I fear that our current government is going to miss the boat completely on all of this growing and all these things just because they're fighting.
4445160	4446642	I don't need to get into it.
4446662	4447364	You all know how I feel.
4447684	4449908	You heard some of the names mentioned in this.
4450128	4453053	There's going to be some involvement.
4453073	4453333	True.
4454214	4454595	True.
4456516	4458078	The whole thing's just very annoying.
4458559	4469093	But as tends to happen when these companies go ass up and it always sucks because you hate to hear about the job loss.
4469113	4475722	You hate to hear about the people and all these – the shareholders and the people at the top of the food chain get all the money and walk away scot-free.
4476423	4477784	Hello, Bobby Kotick and Activision.
4478926	4479807	But –
4481052	4491361	Usually what happens is that then new studios and new independents get formed and new things come out of the ashes that then us gamers tend to eat up.
4491381	4509138	So I think it just makes it more important for us to be paying attention to the smaller projects and the things that are coming from smaller studios and startups and things that entire other companies and governments do not have their hands in.
4509158	4509658	Anyway.
4509892	4517139	Honestly, I feel that this is something that's been in the works at least since post-Gulf War.
4517799	4530391	I mean, if you think about it, we're coming from, I mean, basically, I'm not going to throw the other acts into it, but we pretty much tore apart their economy.
4532894	4539460	And now, going back to the diversifying outside of oil,
4539693	4556892	We're having a major move away from using oil and those limited natural resources to go into more electric energy and hybrid energy sources.
4557693	4565802	And so I think that's also a matter of seeing which way the wind is blowing and trying to find a viable industry to
4565866	4592937	Games can't be fun.
4593946	4595151	It's a cycle.
4596174	4596797	It comes and goes.
4597218	4598322	Things will get better again.
4598503	4599467	Things will get worse again.
4599507	4600330	That's just life.
4600631	4602739	That's how it goes.
4602759	4605188	And I think there's always, you know...
4606484	4608286	There's a way to find a silver lining, I think.
4609067	4618517	And it could very well be that this might revitalize EA and bring back old titles or something that's good for the gamers too.
4618537	4620339	I mean, we can think about it in that way.
4622422	4626767	It might just be an influx of money that they might put into hiring more people.
4626787	4629790	I mean, I'm trying to think of some way things could be positive.
4630691	4633474	So I don't know.
4633874	4635276	I'm just trying to think of...
4635796	4640160	where it could go in a positive direction.
4640281	4641462	Just sort of throwing that out there.
4642763	4643023	All right.
4643043	4649370	Well, speaking of the cycle of things come and things go, let's go to our next story about things going.
4650771	4652192	So long, King Bowser.
4653514	4658939	No, but yes, Doug Bowser is retiring from Nintendo after being there for five years.
4658959	4660681	It's been five years.
4661382	4661582	Yeah.
4661602	4661702	Yeah.
4661952	4689073	Satoru Shibata Satoru Shibata Satoru Shibata
4690049	4694213	and he'll be joining as the CEO I think there's two roles though, right?
4694414	4716377	so there's now the CEO and then there's also Devin Pritchard is going to be the executive to succeed Doug Bowser as well who becomes the first woman to lead Nintendo of America yep that's awesome
4716863	4721067	Yeah, you know, it's it's just an executive change.
4721087	4730257	And I don't think it really changes a lot about although, you know, you kind of look back and you go, damn, Reggie Fils-Aimé had so much personality and brought so much to that role.
4730317	4730678	Right.
4730698	4737205	And Doug Bowser brought, as Ranmari says in chat, the quote, respecting the value of $80 games tagline to us.
4737225	4740508	So, you know, so you're kind of kind of hoping like that.
4740488	4748379	It is a weird question to ask because I understand it's a great thing to see a woman in that role.
4748679	4753286	And I would be asking this question no matter if it was a woman, man, non-binary, whoever in that role.
4753466	4754728	But are they fun?
4755148	4756810	Because Reggie Fils-Aimé was fun.
4756971	4759634	And so I would like to see a little bit of fun come back to that role.
4760255	4762118	I realize it's not supposed to be a fun role.
4762158	4763780	Running a company isn't always a fun business.
4763820	4765883	But Reggie Fils-Aimé brought a lot of fun to that role.
4765983	4766023	So
4766003	4788822	I know, but we will never again have an Iwata.
4789814	4791116	Ain't that the truth?
4791657	4792337	Ain't that the truth?
4793058	4801009	Alright, well, speaking of things that Nintendo is not a fan of, let's talk a little bit about what's going on in PAL World right now.
4802411	4808079	PAL World, and of course this linked to a different story.
4808580	4810022	Things happen sometimes.
4810042	4811183	I keep scrolling and it's there.
4811824	4812385	Oh, okay.
4812405	4813526	Thank you.
4813647	4818353	PAL World is going to be doing a spin-off game
4818822	4822691	called Create Your Own Amazing Farm With Your Favorite Pals.
4822732	4825037	This is what they said on... Palfarm.
4825659	4826701	Is it called Palfarm?
4828045	4831854	Fields, crops, and a slow-paced life in this powerful game.
4832155	4836004	What people are noticing is that it's a very similar game to...
4835984	4836906	What did they call that?
4836946	4843281	Pokemon Poketopia or whatever that game was called that they just did that looked like Dragon Quest Builders.
4843742	4847050	They had just announced that like two weeks ago and now Palworld's saying, guess what?
4847451	4848594	We're going to do that too.
4849356	4852744	Yeah, I mean, obviously they are not aware.
4853365	4854668	Yeah, they're not aware that
4854901	4857786	I mean, there's no way that they're like, oh, we're going to copy them.
4858047	4858287	Yeah.
4858607	4860531	No, they already did everything.
4860551	4862574	I mean, they already copied the Animal Crossing.
4862594	4870789	Well, and I think it's also about that, like, you know, DarkSakura points out, you know, other games in that space.
4870849	4872672	That is a very popular genre.
4873093	4875637	You know, so there's a lot of properties that want to get into that space.
4875858	4879043	So, and Fifth Dream says they've claimed they've been working on it for a year.
4879284	4880065	I believe them.
4880045	4896923	and I believe them too when all that fucking money rolled in when Palworld first launched which was a little over a year ago they probably decided they were going to put that money into developing more games and this is one of them so I believe it they've been working on their mole at Nintendo for a year
4897662	4910163	What I find most interesting about this trailer is at the very end, like, just even after they've already announced the title and all that stuff, it's just like kind of the, oh, let's, hey, let's do one last funny scene.
4910624	4916314	The character throws what looks like a Pokeball to pick up a penguin, you know, bird type thing.
4916354	4918658	It's like, are you just...
4919127	4921852	Trying to poke the bear at this point?
4921993	4927904	Yeah, somebody over there loves to smoke cigarettes and sit on the front porch and say, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
4927945	4930770	Like somebody is inviting this.
4931271	4934277	I'm imagining it's like a clone of Joan Rivers.
4935219	4937604	Just like chain smoking and saying it in her voice.
4938085	4940730	We're gonna get Nintendo today.
4943579	4946022	What else can we do to piss in their cornflakes?
4946042	4949926	Sometimes I do this shit just to feel something, but I feel alive.
4951508	4954171	I'm sorry, not piss in their cornflakes, piss in their natto.
4956094	4957275	Alright.
4957295	4958556	Yeah, Joan Rivers.
4959277	4963002	But will it land Pal World in the Video Game Hall of Fame, DarkSakura?
4964263	4964403	No.
4965825	4966966	No, I don't think it's ever going to be there.
4967186	4967747	What might?
4968790	4972914	Well, I actually have a list of our class of 2025.
4973734	4976157	These are the inductees.
4976317	4979880	We have for Golden Age Gamer, Tim Collum.
4979900	4983503	1990s era gamer, Michael Tang.

4997376	4998797	Yay, Games Done Quick!
4999553	5025493	Walter Day Lifetime Achievement goes to Trip Hawkins Golden Age Game Space Invaders 1990s Game Half-Life 2000s Game The Sims Pinball The Electrical Mechanical Era so like 70s before Humpty Dumpty Digital Pinball goes to Black Knight and Modern Pinball Medieval Madness
5027043	5031749	Now, this is the Video Game Hall of Fame that's out in the middle of nowhere, not the one in New York, right?
5035575	5037678	Yeah, International Video Game Hall of Fame.
5038038	5038298	Yeah.
5039380	5045148	The Walter Day reference gave it away, that this is the one that's in the middle of nowhere, Ottumwa, Iowa, or wherever.
5046970	5047651	Yeah.
5047671	5049153	Well, I mean, I'll find out.
5049734	5053219	But I just thought it was cool, the recognition being...
5053672	5056935	And having Pinball involved in it, it made me feel happy.
5056955	5057336	Of course.
5057756	5058117	Yeah, I know.
5058537	5062181	And obviously multiple sort of video game halls of fame, they exist.
5062201	5063663	And we've known about this one for a while.
5063723	5072072	It's just, you know, it's always kind of like they're trying to make a place, a tourist destination that is, what, three hours from a major airport.
5072092	5077557	So, you know, but it definitely, it's kind of one of those things where you go, hmm, I'd love to see what kind of setup they have.
5077637	5078618	Might be kind of interesting.
5079039	5079139	Yeah.
5079119	5098225	so but unfortunately I can't think of literally anything else I would want to do in Iowa besides maybe go to this place I'm trying to verify if that is the one their website is so poorly designed though I'm almost the Walter Day reference is a huge clue that it is so
5099892	5101695	Bobby and Chat got it to load and said it is.
5106463	5107805	But still, yeah, good picks.
5107825	5110369	And it is, yes, pinball should be recognized.
5110389	5111891	There's a lot of fun pinball stuff out there.
5112993	5114936	Okay, moving on.
5114976	5115437	Loki.
5116852	5127026	Well, we kind of alluded to this last week when we were talking about Randy Pitchford losing his mind on social media, but Borderlands is getting some updates.
5127527	5133155	So one thing that was requested by a lot of people playing the game was FOV sliders on consoles.
5133175	5139584	So those have finally been put out, and now you can actually check that out.
5139685	5144952	Also, there are various fixes for hitching, low FPS, and crashes.
5144932	5151141	that were patched into the PlayStation and Xbox versions as well.
5152062	5154606	Different stability and performance things.
5154947	5159133	A whole bunch of those and rebalancing as well.
5159213	5160715	So that's good at least.
5160735	5167625	And then, now the bad news is that Borderlands 4 is delayed indefinitely on the Switch.
5167805	5172272	It was just about to come out on October 3rd and they're like, nah-uh.
5172775	5175859	Gee, I wonder what might have changed their minds on that front.
5175959	5177421	Could be the performance issues.
5177441	5182188	I can almost guarantee they're taking a second look at that on the Switch 2 of all systems.
5182508	5185091	Yeah, it runs not great on a 5090.
5186453	5189718	Oh, there's not a 5090 in that Switch 2, is there?
5190479	5192641	Oh, yeah.
5193242	5194564	Yeah.
5194544	5203175	And that's probably a good thing because then they can do what they need to do and then maybe people give it a different sort of look by the time it comes out for Switch 2.
5203576	5207661	Kind of similar, in a way, similar to Cyberpunk, right?
5207801	5212447	By the time Cyberpunk finally came out on the Switch 2, it's like, oh, now this is a game worth playing.
5212467	5219316	When it first came out, it was even more disastrous, I think, than what we're hearing about Borderlands 4, quite frankly.
5220377	5221058	Yeah, yeah.
5222202	5247737	Questbuster in chat says, from what I've read, a new Vault Hunter was introduced at Tokyo Game Show by Pitchford, who apparently spent most of the time before announcing it doing magic tricks God, I hate him He's so annoying No one cares about your magic That is just so Arrested Development He just feels like he's out of that show Just like...
5248730	5249611	I don't know, man.
5249691	5252035	Like, he, just like, can you quit?
5252055	5258864	Hey, hey, Randy, like, how about you just quit your job as CEO and go be a full-time magician?
5258884	5259745	Just do that.
5259785	5260867	New release date.
5260887	5261808	Then we don't have to listen.
5262189	5264712	You can be happy and we don't have to listen or see you ever again.
5264933	5268337	New release date for Borderlands 4 on Switch 2, Cinco de Cuatro.
5270480	5271582	Just, I...
5274785	5293688	I don't like that man uh um interesting uh Bobby Blackwolf uh was I guess fell down a rabbit hole looking at that video game hall of fame Billy Mitchell is a director at that video game hall of fame that actually doesn't surprise me that doesn't fucking surprise me because of his all the more reason for me not to ever visit there
5293668	5316537	all of the involvement with the the twin galaxy like that's that's just an extension of twin galaxies all of that anyway uh other comments in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network Dark Tetsuya confirming can confirm it ran pretty well on the switch too talking about uh cyberpunk so hopefully uh Borderlands 4 if they take the time to fix it up uh will be in a good place as well
5316517	5326236	Okay, let's move on and talk about the ROG Ally and this new Xbox handheld.
5326336	5337377	So the ROG Xbox Ally, we now know exactly how much it's going to set people back and everybody's saying, oh my God, it's $1,000, $1,000.
5337357	5347384	Well, yes, the ROG Xbox Ally X 24GB RAM 1TB SSD is $999 USD.
5347752	5349315	There is a different version, though.
5349355	5357591	It's a 16 gigs of RAM, 512 gigabyte SSD that will cost you $599 or $600.
5357952	5361679	So that's, you know, kind of yikes.
5361839	5369895	But also, I'm sure, you know, our dear leaders, Genius Tariff Program are coming into play with what they're having to charge for some of this.
5369875	5390823	No, like, when we're talking about, like, RAM and, like, SSDs, like, unless there's, like, processor changes as well, there's no way $400 worth of upgrade for an additional 8 gigs of RAM and, you know, I think, was it 5 or 12 gigabytes in SSD?
5390883	5392165	I think that's, like, $40.
5393306	5394668	And 8 gigs of RAM, like...
5395475	5397137	probably less than $40.
5397758	5398359	There's no way.
5398740	5401504	I mean, a part of me says just get a fucking PC at that point.
5401524	5405930	I mean, I realize it's not portable, but, you know, anyway.
5405970	5407833	Probably, yeah.
5408174	5409856	Or Steam Deck or something.
5410117	5410457	Yes.
5410477	5412821	A Steam Deck is about, what, three?
5412841	5414323	It's under $350 at this point.
5414483	5415545	They just dropped the price.
5415585	5419991	Yeah, with a 256 gigabyte LCD model that says it's on sale now for $319.20.
5421233	5421313	Oof.
5424263	5427667	Good luck to the ROG allies.
5428528	5430691	At this point, this is just poorly timed.
5430911	5442926	Honestly, if I were ROG, if I were Microsoft, I would fucking delay this until the midterms, which God help us all, hopefully start to fix some of these problems with tariffs.
5442946	5446170	Because remember, Congress could fix the tariff problem tomorrow.
5446550	5448212	It's just that they're not going to.
5448192	5475415	um so if they are not going to do what we need them to do then we have to put new people in there but we won't get that opportunity for which hopefully we're all going to get that opportunity some days I start to wonder but you know if we are still America we should have that opportunity in a year um so we'll we'll see what happens with that I just think at this point like if you're going to spend a thousand dollars on a first off like a portable Xbox console like
5476070	5476350	Yeah.
5476370	5501250	Yeah.
5502142	5511485	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane when, you know, games didn't all need to be portable unless it was like a Game Boy or a Game Gear or something.
5511545	5512287	Let's roll the bumper.
5522982	5530837	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5530857	5533482	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5534464	5536508	And DarkSakura, neat choice tonight.
5536528	5537650	What did you pick for us?
5538541	5540884	I chose Princess Crown.
5541726	5549337	It came out on the Sega Saturn, developed and published by Atlas in collaboration with Sega, only in Japan.
5549357	5556247	It was released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and later ported to the PSP in 2005.
5556527	5566101	It has a 2D side-scrolling perspective, kind of like a... I mean, it is a beat-em-up style fighting system, but it has role-play elements.
5566081	5590570	and you control the Queen, Gradiel de Valendia and trying to aid people to prevent the resurrection of a demon lord and so you get different character scenarios by completing that quest and then all the story routes lead to the true ending kind of like how Live Alive does.
5591258	5610702	So the game began development in 1995 at a company that, this doesn't say the company, but former Capcom veteran George Kamitani was the director.
5610682	5632762	and then when the company went bankrupt they were absorbed into Atlas Osaka Studio and they wanted them to continue the development and they wanted it to be a life simulator game like Princess Maker 2 but it was redesigned into an action roleplay like other titles that were on PlayStation as competition and the game itself actually was a commercial failure.
5632902	5639608	However, it was very positively reviewed and absolutely
5639588	5642084	Lotted for its design.
5642104	5644519	The game is very pretty.
5645815	5649239	It actually continued to influence Kamitani's career.
5650360	5660031	In fact, it led him to found me a company, Vanillaware, and developed the spiritual successor, Odin Sphere.
5660772	5669882	They were going to do a Dreamcast sequel, but it was cancelled, so it was revived by Vanillaware as Dragon's Crown.
5670115	5680006	So, like I said, it's a 2D side-scrolling action role-play game where you control four different characters in multiple scenarios.
5680947	5687094	And you have to use these paths that connect towns and dungeons and then explore around and purchase items and stuff like that.
5687955	5693241	Your combat is a beat-em-up system, and it's triggered by random encounters.
5693261	5694402	So...
5694382	5699148	I'm not going to get too much more into there, but I can tell you that there is an English translation out there now.
5699228	5701510	There's several levels of translation that's out there.
5704073	5718871	But at any rate, like I said, it was created by George Kamitani, who worked at Capcom doing Saturday Night Slam Masters and Dungeons & Dragons Tower of Doom before he became a freelancer.
5720252	5723376	This company that he had
5724048	5728460	He actually founded it with a friend and they were based in Osaka.
5729643	5733935	But then they were going to do adult video games and then branched out.
5734095	5735078	But yeah, that didn't last.
5737244	5738327	So...
5740518	5751451	When they pitched it to Sega, they asked if it was going to be a lengthy role-playing game and they wanted to keep doing those to compete with Sony.
5752071	5754154	And so he just said, yeah, it's a role-play game.
5754334	5756576	And then he redid his designs to make it fit.
5759640	5770052	So this was in the middle of when Sega was dealing with a possible merger with Bandai and
5771669	5778338	Then, because of another contact he had at Sega, Kamitani pitched it to Atlas, and Atlas was like, yeah, let's do this.
5778503	5790539	So as far as the music, it was done by the in-house Atlas sound team with some additional work by Metal Slug composer Toshikazu Tanaka.
5792962	5795686	And it's beautiful music in the game.
5795706	5796327	It's really great.
5796527	5799611	But they said the production was absolute chaos.
5799751	5804157	It was under a working title of Book of Sorcery.
5805250	5812899	They intended to call it Purikura, but because of Princess Crown, you know, Purinsesu Crown, you know.
5813620	5821148	So at any rate, though, it would be too mixed up with Purikura, which is photo booths, picture club, right?
5823371	5825053	So, yeah.
5825553	5835004	Now, as far as the art design was influenced by the illustrations of John Tenniel, who did a lot of illustration for Alice in Wonderland.
5836216	5852588	the game has of course been ported to PSP and that was managed by Hiroki Toyama who is an Atlas staff member who went on to work on Tokyo Monoharashi Karasunomori Gakuen Kitan and
5853749	5864078	They basically had to go through and debug the game completely and get it to function on the PSP which took some doing but they got it going.
5864759	5875689	And then a port of the PSP version went to PS4 and it was released as a pre-order bonus and paid DLC for 13 Sentinels Aegis Rim.
5877090	5881174	And it also...
5881154	5884108	Buyers got the digital art book.
5885073	5890438	There is no international version of Princess Crown.
5890604	5900019	But I can let you know, like I said earlier, a translation is fully complete and out there.
5901060	5902222	You just have to know how to find it.
5904546	5914401	But the reason why the game failed was actually because of... This was the end of the Saturn's life when this came out.
5914381	5917626	They were already dealing with financial losses.
5919209	5922794	Coming back from the bankruptcy as well, the Saturn version is pretty rare.
5924357	5928463	The PSP version sold 22,000 units in 2005.
5931849	5935274	But it got lots of really good reviews.
5937337	5939781	Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40.
5940503	5942466	Hardcore Gamer, 4 out of 5.
5943308	5944330	RPG fan, 95%.
5945792	5952384	So, I mean, it got really, really good reviews.
5952424	5965026	And it's even been ranked amongst other titles like Crisis Core, Final Fantasy VII, and LocoRoco as being up there with pretty decent RPGs.
5965006	5989208	so um as for the legacy of this game um Kamitani's team was actually blacklisted in the game industry so his career suffered for a while but um the other thing that went down was that Atlas Kansai which is Osaka um dissolved and several of their staff members went on to found Noise Factory um
5990791	5993681	So that's why Vanillaware was founded.
5993781	5998116	It was also with former Atlas staff members, and that's when Odin Sphere came out.
5998136	5999721	And it was a success.
5999971	6001954	So it was sort of like the big comeback.
6001974	6008743	And their next game was Muramasa the Demon Blade, which was a spiritual successor to Princess Crown as well.
6009704	6022201	And then an actual sequel, like I said, it was canceled for Dreamcast, but then they went on to create Dragon's Crown as the redesigned version.
6022702	6023162	And there you go.
6023643	6025125	Princess Crown.
6025145	6026046	All right.
6026718	6034668	Little trip down memory lane or certainly some of those, you know, whether it's the PSP version or Dragon Crown or how people kind of got it into this later.
6036170	6037491	Yeah, cool trip down memory lane.
6038252	6040875	Classic game of the week.
6040895	6041216	All right.
6042157	6043439	We just have a little bit more for you.
6043459	6049306	We got some rapid fire news, some dates and maybe some time for some feedback from y'all.
6049326	6053731	But let's get to that rapid fire news first and take on a couple other quick headlines.
6053751	6054312	Loki.
6055152	6057277	Daft Punk are getting back together next year.
6057297	6057798	They're not.
6057818	6059642	They are just going to be in Fortnite.
6059662	6060143	Fake news.
6060364	6061306	Yeah, no, it's fake news.
6061366	6061827	Yes, yes.
6062929	6070186	So there's going to be a collaboration event with Daft Punk called the Daft Punk Experience actually started yesterday.
6070206	6072310	I was going to say, I've been hearing great things about it.
6072330	6073954	It makes me want to reinstall Fortnite.
6074305	6086580	So they are going to have different activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk music, a horde mode featuring zombies, or I'm sorry, robots, and a dance club.
6086820	6087541	Are they in festival?
6088362	6089243	They might be in festival.
6089404	6090345	Shit, I need to check that out.
6090545	6092828	Can we in chat confirm, did some of their songs come to festival?
6093128	6096212	I'm reinstalling them, if that's the case.
6097053	6098736	I want Lego Daft Punk though.
6098896	6101159	That looks awesome.
6101420	6106327	I actually have a couple of Daft Punk songs that are in my Fortnite collection.
6106347	6107008	Oh, that's cool.
6108010	6109332	Alright, I'll check it out.
6109352	6110393	So that looks pretty cool.
6111135	6118446	And then another military shooter game that becomes I don't even know what at this point.
6119267	6120529	PUBG Mobile
6120813	6144660	is there is a I don't know if it was a leak or like an announcement video that was put out um showcasing a bunch of different tie-ins all together um that give you a video of Sonic the Hedgehog um and some other soldiers and whatnot fighting Skivity Toilet so that's what PUBG Mobile has become or is
6145687	6148110	I thought PUBG was a military shooter game.
6148471	6152115	Yeah, I kind of forgot PUBG was even a thing until you brought it up just now.
6152155	6153958	So, yeah, it is what it is.
6153978	6155880	Some collaborations.
6155900	6157382	Some comments on Daft Punk.
6157442	6161027	DarkTetsuya says they are doing a Daft Punk themed controller for Festival.
6161087	6162288	That's interesting.
6162308	6165272	SG100Matt says, I played it last night and it's great.
6165432	6166674	Totally worth reinstalling.
6167876	6168236	All right.
6169317	6169838	DarkSakura.
6174155	6175957	I had to unmute, sorry.
6175977	6181224	So Konami has announced a game creation project at Tokyo Game Show.
6181244	6185469	It's YY Worldcraft for PC, iOS, and Android.
6187752	6194340	It is a crafting game where it's user-generated content.
6194320	6200847	You can use this tool to create a game and have others play it.
6200867	6206854	You have a world editor to customize the world and make your rules based off of official games.
6207014	6212100	You can pay for parts, you know, little transactions.
6214202	6219568	And fine-tune the different elements and basically put it up there so...
6219548	6224876	You have different Konami characters appearing in it as well, just like the old YY World games.
6225597	6228962	So you can have them as characters or enemies.
6230064	6232948	And the announcement looks cool.
6235432	6238576	It has the frogs, which I think is cute.
6238797	6243143	I see Contra people, and I see...
6244068	6247815	Yeah, I see a Belmont somewhere.
6248937	6250179	And I see, yeah.
6250680	6252083	So this could be fun.
6252103	6260338	And I'm glad that the YY World branding is, or universe idea is coming back.
6261719	6274525	Well, speaking of branding and things of the past coming back, very excited that Elvira Scared Stiff Pinball is coming to Pinball FX coming next month, October 16th, 2025.
6274585	6276890	This is one of Alan's favorite pinball tables of all time.
6276930	6278573	He loves the Elvira ones.
6278813	6280116	This was in my house for a while.
6280096	6281659	I know, because I love Elvira.
6281679	6283201	I love Elvira.
6283401	6290673	So, of course, just in time for Halloween, Elvira is coming to Williams Pinball FX.
6290713	6299067	I guess they're calling it Williams Pinball Scared Stiff for Pinball FX, although I've already called this table Elvira Scared Stiff, so I don't know what they did with the licensing or whatever, but it is Elvira.
6299047	6315317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6316090	6318413	The official game is Scared Stiff.
6318634	6321498	Elvira's name is not in the branding to begin with.
6321558	6336158	It features Elvira, but it's just called Scared Stiff.
6336138	6336739	Interesting.
6336759	6336979	All right.
6336999	6343851	Well, the more you know, there, of course, are the six modes from that little spider that spun around at the top of the machine.
6343871	6347016	And of course, you know, the classic feel with all the enhancements.
6347036	6347857	Yeah, all that good stuff.
6348218	6354288	I mean, I gotta admit, I don't remember the last time I bought a table for Pinball FX, but you have my attention.
6354308	6357934	Or should I say, I'm scared stiff for this one.
6357954	6358635	So...
6359138	6360240	All right.
6360340	6367029	OrangeRite is pointing out that the other table was Elvira and the Party Monsters, and maybe that's where my confusion is coming from.
6367049	6373578	No, I think it's just maybe just you assume that Elvira is going to have the branding at the top, but it is what it is.
6373879	6374339	It's a name.
6374880	6375962	Is she in the game?
6376002	6376763	That's all I care about.
6377263	6378805	All right.
6379326	6381850	Whether her credit is above the line or below the line, I don't care.
6382110	6386797	I will say Elvira's House of Horrors is another one, the more recent one.
6387197	6387778	Hmm.
6388282	6393671	Yeah, that's that's the one with the video integration and all that is like the most recent one, right?
6394613	6395034	Correct.
6395875	6400303	But Scared Stiff is the one that did not bear her name in the title.
6400323	6401545	Interesting.
6402788	6403008	All right.
6403028	6403970	Well, let's move on.
6404170	6409900	We're going to check out some release dates, some things coming a little sooner than an Elvira pinball table this week.
6409960	6411062	Let's start with the U.S.

6487613	6488794	Yes, okay, okay.
6488874	6490036	I'm sorry, did you say something, Rob?
6490457	6491558	Thank you.
6491799	6496906	I remember the Diablo-esque preview because I went, oh shit, that looks cool because it looks like Diablo with SpongeBob.
6497246	6499429	Okay, never mind, I corrected myself.
6499589	6503935	I thought, when you talked about dice though, I thought like Mario Party, but no, it's the Diablo-y thing.
6504015	6504596	Okay, cool.
6505978	6512627	Yeah, with SpongeBob, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Avatar, and the Fairly OddParents characters.
6512988	6514510	So, pretty cool.
6514709	6515835	Let's see.

6563950	6571258	We have Digimon Story, Time Stranger on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

6588345	6589307	Now that's it.
6589327	6590850	Did you mention Final Fantasy Tactics?
6591933	6592193	I did.
6593796	6597484	I missed it, but that's the one game I already It was like the third game I...
6597869	6599793	Sorry, I was thinking about SpongeBob.
6600074	6600455	All right.
6601156	6603021	But yes, going to Japan, similar story.
6603041	6605025	Final Fantasy Tactics, the Evil East Chronicles.
6605105	6607631	Yes, it is out in Japan on the Nintendo Switch 2 this week.
6607671	6615068	In fact, it's really the only major release on the Switch 2 in Japan this week, but that's probably because the Switch 2 is getting less games than the Switch 1.
6615048	6620194	If you go over to the PlayStation 5, though, you have quite a few more games that are coming out in Japan.
6620214	6623778	Final Fantasy Tactics, of course, making its way out there as well in Japan.
6624639	6628003	And Ghost Yotei, also out on the PS5 in Japan.
6628083	6632648	Digimon Story Time Stranger, also getting a Japanese release this week on October 2nd.
6632968	6635331	That is in a regular, limited, and collector's edition.
6635511	6639295	But don't worry, if you want a collector's edition for Ghost Yotei, they will do that as well.
6639716	6641578	A game called Happy Route O...
6641558	6644101	Owo Asete is also out this week.

6647805	6655773	And there is a new DualSense controller themed with the Gosiote that is also out if you would like to check that out.
6655793	6658256	And I think that is it for Japan this week.
6658276	6659897	So let's go over to the UK, DarkSakura.

6775143	6776745	Let's get to the listener roundtable.
6776765	6777926	I think we have at least one.
6777946	6780530	I saw one small email come in this week.
6780570	6783053	I don't know if there's others, but you can always email us, of course.
6783153	6787899	Participate at orangelondrader.com if you would like to send us any emails to talk about here on the show.
6788060	6790743	I will open up our green room over at Discord.
6791084	6793827	If you want to chat with us throughout the week, it's a great place to do it is on Discord.
6793887	6802819	I haven't shouted them out enough tonight, but of course, vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to join us and talk to us throughout the week.
6802799	6809553	Um, I will, I do see somebody in the green room, but I do want to, if the email's up, I- Yes, there's an email.
6809773	6810355	Okay, let's do it.
6812399	6816808	Um, it's, uh, subject is Debbie Delight on the Storm Dork.
6817666	6819751	Hello peoples, recently I bought a Steam Deck.
6819811	6824403	Poking around in the Steam Store's Great on Decks section, I see Dead by Daylight.
6824864	6827250	I wonder what y'all think of Dead by Daylight on Steam Decks.
6827330	6828312	Take care, Red Entertainment.
6828513	6832423	I don't have a Steam Deck, so I don't have any opinion, but I wouldn't want to play it on a Steam Deck.
6832683	6834207	I absolutely need keyboard and mouse.
6834592	6840780	I do have a Steam Deck, and I have played Dead by Daylight a little bit on the Steam Deck, and I will say it's better than a Switch.
6842021	6851052	Couldn't tell you about Switch 2, but I don't think it's as good as playing it on a PC, and actually I feel a little bit similar to DarkSakura.
6851152	6854576	I kind of need the keyboard and mouse, at least for Killer, I have to have it.
6854596	6861645	I can kind of do Survivor on controller, but then I think we get into... But if your Steam Deck has a dock...
6861625	6862727	You can always do it that way.
6863929	6865271	But yeah, you'd have to have a dog.
6865291	6870078	I tried to play controller in a custom match and it was way too sensitive.
6870118	6871500	The analog was way too sensitive.
6872101	6875486	I also find when you're just used to one thing, it is really hard to switch.
6875526	6881716	And that's true about not just Dead by Daylight, but any game that supports both formats, whether that's an Overwatch, whether it's a Final Fantasy 14.
6882217	6884821	Like, you know, it's hard to switch once you get kind of used to it.
6884841	6888426	I can switch back and forth in Baldur's Gate because half the time my controller doesn't work.
6889334	6892293	And that's a game where I would insist on keyboard mouse for sure.
6892635	6894467	So there you go.
6895240	6895560	All right.
6896381	6896802	Well, thank you.
6896862	6898143	I love the Storm Deck.
6898163	6899264	Or no, Storm Dork.
6899284	6900465	Was that what it was called?
6900505	6901046	Storm Dork?
6901066	6902307	I love that name.
6902327	6902628	Okay.
6902988	6907312	Anyway, happy... Oh, here would be my advice to you, actually.
6907372	6909955	I have serious advice for that listener.
6909975	6914580	Wait for a Steam sale, because that game always goes on sale.
6914760	6916442	Do not pay full price for it.
6916502	6922468	There will absolutely... I bet... This one's still right now, if I'm correct, because they just released the Karasu.
6922548	6922648	Yeah.
6922628	6945700	yeah so never buy that game full price always wait for a sale and I was gonna say if nothing else Halloween I mean it sounds like there's one now so great but Halloween I would fully expect a spooky game sale and that's gonna be one of the games that's involved with it so all right well and also don't don't uh don't forget uh I forgot what I was gonna say now um
6948532	6954053	You can also get killer and survivor bundles, so that can make things more affordable.
6954404	6958791	Oh yeah, I think any of the original ones you're going to have to buy in a bundle.
6958891	6964519	Well, that are dated, not the new new ones, but any dated one from its multi-year history.
6964960	6966682	All right, let's get to the green room though.
6966702	6968705	We got somebody in there we haven't heard from for a little bit.
6968725	6972070	So let's move to the Skype line.
6972491	6972952	Hello!
6973092	6973753	Hello!
6973813	6976417	Jesus Christ, I aged myself like 40 years.
6976857	6978640	Hi, you're on Orange Zones Radio, who's this?
6980746	6982789	I can't believe you said Skype live.
6982809	6983870	I know, Jesus Christ.
6983890	6986394	Some things in my brain just will never go away, Ranma.
6986775	6987355	How are you, Ranma?
6987375	6987976	It's good to see you.
6989078	6990280	I'm good.
6990320	6995086	You know, let's just chalk it up as we're getting too old for this shit-itis.
6995106	6996689	That's what we should chalk it up as.
6996709	6998511	Skype literally doesn't exist anymore.
6998712	7002477	It was like, they finally pulled the plug on that and it's all Teams or whatever now.
7002497	7003318	There is no Skype.
7003739	7005682	So I don't know where my brain is at.
7006523	7009487	Some wheels keep on turning.
7010142	7013748	Just so you know, Skype still exists.
7014148	7016472	It's just teams with a brand new suit.
7016712	7017654	That's all it is.
7017674	7018555	Oh, is that what it is now?
7019376	7022020	So I don't know how much I'm supposed to say.
7022080	7022822	I don't think it's a big deal.
7022842	7026748	At work, we use Skype for business, like right up until the bitter end.
7026988	7031014	And we switched to Teams a certain amount of time ago.
7031174	7034860	So I was still using Skype at work long after I used it on this program.
7035421	7036082	So...
7037429	7038819	I understand completely.
7038839	7043592	Sometimes I miss it, but then there are times I'm like, I'm glad I don't.
7044280	7068870	I'm also looking at your shirt I know folks on the podcast can't see your shirt but you're wearing a it's a black shirt but bright it says I'd rather be excluded for who I include oh I've heard the same before I'd rather be excluded for who I include than be included for who I exclude and it has a variety of hearts on it including I pick out trans rights the American flag rainbow what's the one on the left is that bear I don't know what that one is
7068850	7071001	This one right here.
7071283	7072408	Oh, that's like black light.
7072429	7074861	No, is that like the black and brown from the...
7075128	7078773	Yeah, this kind of goes with the... Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Black Lives Matter.
7078813	7079614	Okay, yeah, got it.
7079694	7079914	Cool.
7080696	7089708	Yeah, I'm wearing this because normally during June, during my podcast, I have four different shirts that represents, and I wear one every week.
7089728	7089928	Love it.
7089948	7100342	But because they changed the work dress code, because I always wear t-shirts and stuff like that, because let's be real, it ain't hard to spot the IT person at your office, so...
7100322	7102245	Oh lord.
7102807	7123444	Oh lord.
7123930	7153566	well it's a lot better than the Kirby Netta one I've seen oh Kirby Netta this was my Ingress because since I play for the green team in Ingress I would wear the shirts to Anomalies because we're called frogs because we're the green team so I would wear my Kirby Netta shirt to Anomalies but now I have a shirt with a frog on it and a little knapsack and it says don't know where I'm going but I'm gay and that's my new Ingress playing shirt for Anomalies you know it
7156195	7158719	Okay, I have two things I want to talk about.
7158739	7160321	I'm going to go about my merry little way.
7161302	7168253	The first thing is, my friends invited me out to a DDR rave Friday night.
7169274	7171557	You said something about this in Discord.
7171617	7175503	I won't spoil the punchline, but tell us about the ditter rave.
7175888	7196783	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7196965	7200910	I'm in my pajamas playing Yakuza 0.
7201190	7202873	I'm not leaving the house.
7202893	7204194	And she sends me photos.
7204274	7205276	I'm looking at my watch.
7205296	7208019	I'm like, I'll probably get there by 2 a.m.
7208920	7210462	I'll go get dressed and go.
7211444	7215469	By the time I get there, there was like six of us just dancing around.
7215489	7217151	And...
7219207	7220688	I posted a video.
7221289	7228876	You can see the characters from DDR that we've seen from first to fifth mix that you can select from and dance with you.
7229036	7229817	Mr. Spanky?
7230958	7232179	No, Mr. Spanky.
7232199	7233020	Oh, come on.
7233100	7235002	DDR PC always getting shit on.
7235822	7240227	Look, Mr. Spanky was up there before I arrived because they had like two, three different DJs.
7240607	7243910	So there's little clips of the different characters dancing on the screen.
7243950	7246092	And I get there and I'm just like...
7247135	7248196	What happened here?
7248737	7250680	You know, just give me booze.
7252162	7254185	That would be me at a DDR tournament at this age.
7254545	7255206	Where's the booze?
7256188	7261796	My friends go over and go, no, Matt, my other friend Matt's like, yeah, things are going great except for one thing.
7262476	7264119	What is that?
7264139	7265621	He hasn't played Dynamite Rave.
7265641	7272671	I just look at him like this DDR Dynamite Rave and none of the DJs.
7272691	7274273	And he didn't play Dynamite Rave.
7274928	7276811	He's like, yeah, I've even requested it.
7277272	7278254	They haven't played it.
7278354	7282682	I'm just like, who hired these people?
7284906	7289294	That's like going to Chapel Roan Drag Night and not a single bitch does Pink Pony Club.
7289314	7290136	Like, what the fuck?
7290336	7293522	Like, come on.
7293542	7294143	Damn it, Rob.
7294163	7296447	Not while I'm having my green, my matcha tea, please.
7300358	7305184	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf is probably giving the accurate answer here, going, DJ probably didn't know it was a track.
7305204	7306726	Probably was just like, eh, it's a gig.
7306746	7308348	I'll just play what I want type of thing.
7308729	7310391	And no idea.
7310792	7314176	Was there other, like, DDR erotic?
7314597	7315898	Captain Jack?
7315918	7316820	SmileDK?
7317581	7318141	Kylie?
7319002	7319563	No!
7320665	7321586	I know, it hurts!
7321606	7324129	I would sue for false advertising, honestly.
7324149	7325150	No Olivia Project?
7325751	7326332	No, it's...
7326599	7331408	You know what?
7331929	7338702	I'm going to take the Trixie, Mattel, RuPaul route because I'm just as bald as those two.
7339103	7340666	And I'm going to become a DJ.
7340686	7346517	And I'm going to go around to anime conventions and just put my random CD skipper on DDR soundtracks.
7346537	7347259	And it will be great.
7347279	7348962	It'll probably be better than the music we play now.
7349836	7351639	Rob, I'm going to tell you something.
7351659	7352980	One, that is a great idea.
7353281	7355444	And two, there are some people that do that.
7355624	7361132	They will find an area of the conventions or a hotel that's kind of offline.
7361152	7363936	They will set up their turntables and start playing music.
7363976	7367340	And you turn the corner, little mini rave going on right there.
7367541	7369563	And then I'll play all that DDR music.
7369583	7373409	But then precisely at midnight, I will play Carameldansen just to get booed.
7375592	7377615	Actually, no, you will not get booed.
7377715	7379337	Believe you me.
7380245	7382168	I actually, you know, you know what?
7382188	7382849	I'm going to say it.
7382889	7384771	I'm probably not supposed to say it, but I'm going to say it.
7384811	7387495	That's a tagline for the show if I ever heard one.
7388396	7403177	I suggested to somebody at DragonCon, because all these tracks have these dance parties, and I suggested that the digital media track ought to have a meme party that is nothing but meme, like cosplay.
7403237	7407062	And it's inspired by Captain Spike over at GameBooey.org.
7407042	7432071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7432051	7435435	You could play normal shit.
7435475	7440240	You could play, you know, the... Now slide to the left.
7440260	7440960	Now clap your hands.
7440980	7448929	You could play all that dumb shit and then mix in, you know, all the meme stuff from the internet.
7449189	7453273	That would be the must-go-to party at the con.
7454875	7456877	Again, it's interesting that you say that.
7458460	7462744	There is a convention not too far from me, and Jamie knows a bit, DerpyCon.
7463505	7463685	Yep.
7463765	7472074	One of the video rooms that they have is called the Meme Room, where non-stop meme videos they play all from the A to Con.
7472094	7472675	Genius.
7473355	7474456	It's open to the .Con ends.
7474476	7479822	You can walk in and hang out, and that's all they play in that room is nothing but meme videos.
7479842	7480202	Genius.
7480262	7484907	And how many kids walk into that room and go, lol, and then walk right out?
7486777	7487178	A lot!
7487198	7492927	And then there are some that actually chill out and hang out in there, you know, and just, you know, I'm just like, well, damn, okay, y'all do you.
7493748	7499397	Oh, man, that would be a great panel to do at one of those cons one of these days would be explain memes to an old man.
7500178	7504484	And the goal is to explain current memes to an old man.
7504524	7505526	And I nominate Loki.
7505927	7508751	Somebody has to explain memes to Loki.
7509237	7509597	to me.
7510098	7510638	Yes.
7510658	7512340	I mean, I know quite a few memes.
7512360	7512840	Yeah, you're hip.
7512860	7513261	You're cool.
7516644	7517605	I'm cool.
7520508	7522169	Okay, how about this?
7522189	7524592	Explain memes to a Gen Xer.
7524632	7530777	The entire panel will just be, the Gen Xers just screaming back at the newbies because we're tired.
7530797	7531678	Back in my day.
7532499	7535542	Anyway, alright.
7535862	7536763	But, but,
7537132	7542080	But what if you're actually active in communities that still share all the new and old ones?
7542922	7545326	No, and I watch enough TikTok.
7545366	7546367	I'm hip to the memes.
7546387	7551135	But, you know, I think it would still be kind of funny to do a explain memes to old people.
7551215	7552598	I can't stand going on TikTok.
7553980	7558768	I can only stand looking at my friend's stuff and then just doing the For You page is like full of bullshit.
7559255	7589245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7589815	7600017	I play Borderlands every morning, every Monday with one of my friends, Kuro Hikari-chan, who fell deep into the lore and she absolutely loves it.
7600699	7603445	And I will tell you this, Borderlands is a fun game.
7603745	7604968	It is cracked out.
7606471	7607233	The...
7607905	7613011	First four games, no, the first three games deeply tie within each other.
7613452	7617096	Then the third game kind of loosely ties in.
7617116	7618838	And I think the fourth one is the same way.
7619439	7625566	Because the games tie in through the lore and the fact that each game has a new set of Vault Hunters.
7625586	7633035	And when you play the next game, the Vault Hunters from the prior games show up in the game as like NPCs.
7635597	7638623	I do remember that with 2 and 1.
7638783	7641208	Where does Tiny Tina Wonderlands fall into all this?
7641228	7643533	Because that always looked the most interesting to me.
7643553	7651429	Borderlands 2 because Tiny Tina talks about a game called Bunkers and Badasses and Wonderlands is an offshoot of that.
7653451	7659218	I'll have to check the game out at some point, but this is the wrong week to get me started because now everything's starting to come out.
7659238	7663743	I've got my first of two games I'm getting this week, and then it just goes from there.
7663823	7667928	So we'll pencil you in for February.
7667948	7675937	Fair enough, because right now we're like, I think we're like 10, 15% into the third game because we're doing another run through.
7676317	7679541	And once we're done with this, that's when we're going to jump into four.
7679641	7681543	And we're like, well, by the time we get through this.
7681623	7682785	Hopefully they fix the issues.
7682825	7683205	Yeah.
7683320	7688396	January, February, the game will be on sale and I'll be able to pick it up for PC and Xbox.
7688697	7693633	My friend will have our computer updated by then and then we can just have a free-for-all.
7694677	7696399	That's kind of what happened with me in Mass Effect.
7696459	7700964	I played Mass Effect just enough so that the third game came out like right when I was ready.
7700984	7708632	I'm actually glad I did get to experience the original ending to be able to just compare it to what there is now in that series.
7708772	7718563	But yeah, Borderlands, with some of the issues they're having, maybe it'll just give enough time to make sure that game is nice and pristine for you by the time you get there.
7718583	7719564	Should have already been that way.
7720485	7721646	I don't know.
7722217	7742335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7742315	7750607	2, Tales from the Borderlands, the Borderlands 2 bonus content, Borderlands 3, and then second Tales of the game.
7750988	7753972	That's if you want to understand the full lore of everything.
7754292	7756756	If you just want to play to play, have at it.
7757016	7761423	And in the third game, you help put together a gay wedding and it's amazing.
7761443	7763766	Okay, now you have my attention.
7765315	7771523	Two elderly gay men are getting married and you have to help make sure you get everything together and make sure it happens.
7771783	7773165	It was really hell of fun.
7773185	7777750	What I will point out Ranma left out was nowhere in there did the movie come up.
7778111	7779652	We're not going to talk about her.
7780934	7782856	The movie is gone.
7783397	7783697	Gone.
7784979	7785940	For the record.
7786915	7802882	I do have, I keep my eye on the movie when it hits a certain price to buy it I know, everyone has said it's bad, it's horrible, I know But for 99 cents there's a lot you'll try Yes, yeah One thing I have learned
7803368	7809736	Hang it out with amazing friends and being... There's levels of glutton for punishment that I am.
7810416	7815542	And then when I get to that point, I kind of talk to old Smokey.
7815582	7816884	I'm just like, you know what?
7816904	7819547	I need a little something extra to get through this.
7819727	7822511	Like when I watch Cocaine Bear, okay?
7823111	7824453	You cannot watch that movie.
7824713	7826015	Well, some of us.
7826235	7827556	You cannot watch that movie sober.
7828438	7829699	I cannot watch that movie ever.
7831301	7831401	Yeah.
7833170	7836494	Alright, Ranma, it's always a delight to hear from you.
7836754	7840019	I'm going to let you go so we can wrap it up for the night though, but thank you.
7840539	7848409	Anime Jam Session, of course, Tuesday nights over at Anime Jam Session on Twitch, but you can catch the backlog of episodes over at vognetwork.com.
7848429	7851533	It has links to everything so you can check it out.
7851553	7852694	Got that right.
7853195	7853836	Have a good one, Ranma.
7853856	7855277	It's always a delight to hear from you.
7856159	7856739	Right back at you.
7856759	7859102	Y'all take care and see you in the next video.
7859383	7860544	Bye.
7861013	7863977	I do have a story.
7864938	7868041	It's not entirely around video games, but it could affect it.
7868702	7882178	The courts preliminarily approved a 1.5 billion copyright settlement against Anthropic for AI.
7882158	7896774	Basically, it's a string of these lawsuits that we're going against companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta for their use of copyrighted material to train generative AI.
7897775	7901238	And this class action lawsuit is going through.
7903581	7904021	All right.
7904802	7908206	Yeah, that could be very transformative for that industry.
7908226	7909828	So I'm very curious about it.
7910648	7911169	We'll see.
7913005	7941223	um all right uh with that Loki do you have any last minute stories real quick before we I do not and that's fine because we're running along a little bit with our tech issue earlier so we're gonna wrap it up uh and get out of here for the night thank you so much for checking out our show whether you were here live or you were downloading us thank you so much for checking out Orange Lounge Radio we appreciate you and a nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts Spotify or YouTube wherever you found this show it goes an awful long way to show that you care
7941203	7943266	Let's get everybody's final thoughts.
7943967	7947212	DarkSakura, I assume you're going to be streaming something tonight.
7947232	7947853	I just don't know what.
7948834	7949736	I'm going to play Palia.
7949756	7955585	I mean, that's always what I'm going to do after stream because it's just nice and easy and I don't have to play for very long.
7955605	7955745	Okay.
7956226	7956586	All right.
7956606	7957688	Well, enjoy.
7957728	7961173	And do you have any final thoughts?
7961193	7962555	Resist.
7962575	7962815	All right.
7962856	7963376	Have a good stream.
7964518	7965099	You too.
7965119	7965199	Bye.
7965219	7966761	We'll see you next week.
7966781	7969185	Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.
7969773	7973141	My final thought is hopefully I'll have a new video out soon.
7973161	7975687	I keep needing to do that.
7975727	7978313	I've like refilmed it like four times now.
7978333	7985250	I just need to put something out and then hopefully my whole thing will be done with the digging pretty soon on that.
7986040	7986441	Alright.
7987262	7993290	And my final thought is I meant to do like a longer video on it this week and I just never got around to it.
7993670	8004145	Maybe I'll still put something out this week but I want to wish a happy 50th birthday to the Rocky Horror Picture Show which was celebrated in LA with a big convention this weekend which I was originally going to go to but I didn't.
8005046	8006207	Just things happen sometimes.
8006888	8010934	And so I am sad I missed that but obviously that movie has had a huge impact on my life.
8011515	8015440	One could argue we would have never gotten around to this particular show
8015420	8035982	And I don't care what anybody says, Tim Curry will always look incredible in fishnets.
8036803	8038124	Have a great week, everybody.
8038144	8040006	We'll see you next time here at Orange Launch Radio.
8040407	8040567	Bye.
