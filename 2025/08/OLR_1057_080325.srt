00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:38,138
[SPEAKER_04]: ... ... ... ... ...

2
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:42,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:53,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We're live once again for tonight, August the 20th.

6
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:55,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, not August the 23rd.

7
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,347
[SPEAKER_02]: How about August the 3rd?

8
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fast forwarding time.

9
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:02,395
[SPEAKER_02]: August the 3rd of 2025 with episode number 1057 of our show.

10
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:06,640
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined every week by my co-hosts.

11
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:35,952
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:36,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

13
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:36,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Loki.

14
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:37,535
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

15
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:43,306
[SPEAKER_05]: We're stepping into the future, or maybe that's just like poop that we're stepping into now.

16
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,872
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the future of the gaming industry.

17
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of smells like great now.

18
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:48,497
[SPEAKER_02]: D, all of the above.

19
00:01:48,757 --> 00:01:50,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very that.

20
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:55,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope you're having a good week, despite all the poop going on in the world.

21
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that Twisted Metal playing behind you tonight?

22
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:58,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.

23
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a brand new game called Fumes.

24
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:09,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are a fan of like Vigilante 8 or Twisted Metal, Interstate 76 maybe a little bit.

25
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:12,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if that game was like Vigilante 8 or not.

26
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the same universe.

27
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:18,544
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially it's like a PlayStation-esque...

28
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:41,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Car Combat Game

29
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you can feel free to do.

30
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:50,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should always shill for the Twitch because we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

31
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:55,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

32
00:02:55,502 --> 00:03:00,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really run ads in the middle of the show because we're trying to do a live thing that goes to our podcast feed.

33
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do have Twitch Turbo and we do run ads, like we do at the very beginning before we run live, we still get a cut of that.

34
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:07,600
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually...

35
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I get my money's worth out of Twitch Turbo because I watch enough Twitch.

36
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:16,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch as much Twitch as I do Paramount Plus or any of those subscription networks, so I get my money's worth.

37
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,156
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we certainly would not say no to your subscription money either over at VOG Network.

38
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:24,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps us stay legal, which is always a good thing.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, yeah, we got the new season of Twisted Metals coming up on Peacock, so I thought that might have been it.

40
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:32,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love that you're supporting the indie games and the up-and-coming stuff, so that's

41
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:35,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been looking forward to this one for a while.

42
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:37,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't picked it up just yet, but I'm probably going to.

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it just came out, and it's like 10% off right now, but we're checking it out.

44
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Breakman is asking, this looks fun.

45
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:45,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it on Steam?

46
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It is on Steam, yeah.

47
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Fumes.

48
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Smelling the paint fumes.

49
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:55,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, going to the gas station and getting high off of the... Yeah, there you go.

50
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, SS2100 Matt in chat made a comment earlier.

51
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki is wearing glasses tonight, so he's bringing the Distinguished vibe.

52
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:15,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I do it when I'm so, like, I've been trying to get myself in the mindset of, like, because I've been working on, not to get so much into my gaming week, but working on coding a data pack for Minecraft.

53
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your coding glasses.

54
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:18,222
Yeah.

55
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:28,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I try to associate it with myself that when I put the glasses on, I'm going to be focused and not get distracted by literally all of the other tabs I have open right now.

56
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,385
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

57
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids, don't bother me.

58
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Daddy's got his coding glasses on.

59
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even the kids, it's just the internet.

60
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:39,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, uh, this is... Oh, YouTube.

61
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Reddit.

62
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:42,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Blue Sky.

63
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just constant distractions.

64
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a pair of coding glasses.

65
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:52,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an eaten dress, but I don't have a pair of coding glasses.

66
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:53,985
[SPEAKER_02]: and not an actual address.

67
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:54,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a joke.

68
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

69
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:58,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Other comments in chat.

70
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks are commenting on other car destruction types of games.

71
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,801
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster saying I miss Carmageddon.

72
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:08,267
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says Red Asphalt was a good combat game.

73
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:09,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that being a game.

74
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that being a horrifying...

75
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It was both.

76
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:26,498
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just kidding.

77
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,021
[SPEAKER_05]: No, yeah, it looks pretty good.

78
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:34,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny because, well, it is funny to me because everybody was like, oh, the first season looked like garbage.

79
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people were not ready for that first season, but it did fine.

80
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:43,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I get fine enough to warrant a second season that apparently people are anticipating a lot more than the first one.

81
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:44,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

82
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:48,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, here, I'm going to link the... Oh, someone already linked it in chat.

83
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:48,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

84
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:50,178
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you guys are on it.

85
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I never underestimate the power of chat oogle, or chat GPT, literally.

86
00:05:56,246 --> 00:06:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, let's get into some kickoff topics for tonight.

87
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:04,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into what is going on in the gaming world.

88
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:09,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take it over to you, Loki, to start us off tonight, because Nintendo...

89
00:06:09,323 --> 00:06:37,643
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

90
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:43,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so just keep that in mind when you're looking for Switch games.

91
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that you're aware what it is.

92
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But, that said, there were quite a few trailers shown off for different games.

93
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:54,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So, starting off, we had Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection, which looks pretty good.

94
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:58,081
[SPEAKER_05]: That's expected to come out on the Switch 2 next year.

95
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:06,588
[SPEAKER_05]: The game I'm literally most excited about from the entire Direct whatsoever is Once Upon a Katamari.

96
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new Katamari

97
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:31,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

98
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:36,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you catch the screenshot in part of the trailer that said, they're 69 cousins.

99
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

100
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?

101
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,684
[SPEAKER_02]: That cracked me up.

102
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:45,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot more subtle than that, but it said something about collect all 69 cousins.

103
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:46,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.

104
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.

105
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I died.

106
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:54,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I love humor that only potty humor minded people are going to get.

107
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:56,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down for a brand new Katamari game.

108
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That announcement doesn't mean talked about enough.

109
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:05,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's going to be out on consoles and Steam, so check it out wherever.

110
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:09,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already pre-ordered that stuff, but yeah, I'm very excited about that.

111
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth dream in chat with a fair point, saying, I bet Keita Takahashi has nothing to do with it this time, and I think that's an extremely safe bet.

112
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:23,890
[SPEAKER_02]: He's moved on a long time ago, so I think this really is a classic IP in new hands.

113
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, the Superman movie...

114
00:08:27,952 --> 00:08:34,859
[SPEAKER_02]: People seem to like Pretty Good, and that's an old IP in new hands, and people seem to be fine with it, for the most part.

115
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm open to where this Katamari game might go.

116
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:52,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like by them advertising the soundtrack, by what they're showing in the trailer, by making those little tongue-in-cheek sort of jokes that they said in there...

117
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:56,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that they understand the spirit of why people love the game.

118
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So I sort of like trust them enough to be able to do it, right?

119
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Although sometimes you see people get an IP and it's like, what in the fuck are you doing?

120
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Bomberman Act Zero.

121
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:06,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that on the Xbox 360?

122
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:07,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Bomberman Act Zero?

123
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that what it was?

124
00:09:08,797 --> 00:09:10,099
[SPEAKER_00]: X-Zero, right?

125
00:09:10,119 --> 00:09:13,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that was all futuristic?

126
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:19,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take cutesy little Bomberman and make him fucking steampunk and see how that goes.

127
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:19,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what?

128
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:28,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you sort of see that the IP is in good hands, you are a little more open to what they're going to come up with.

129
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:36,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Konami is not... Konami had a rough patch where they tried to spin off... For like 20 years!

130
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like Konami is finally getting out of their rough patch.

131
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:45,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're smart enough now to where they're pulling the Disney route is like...

133
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:51,434
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we can't trust ourselves to make these games, so we're just going to license the IP to more competent studios.

134
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:52,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what another great example.

135
00:09:53,358 --> 00:10:02,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloober team doing Silent Hill, and a lot of people were skeptical about that, but it turned out, hey, this is actually pretty good, and now they're going to do another one.

136
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:07,045
[SPEAKER_05]: The Metal Gear Solid 3 remake looks pretty good, whereas Metal Gear Solid Survive sucked.

137
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:09,058
[SPEAKER_05]: or Melga, yeah, was it five?

138
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:09,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

139
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Survive?

140
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,863
[SPEAKER_05]: The one with the weird crystal zombies?

141
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,064
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't talk about that, yeah.

142
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:15,825
[SPEAKER_05]: That was weird.

143
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:23,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Remaria points out M2 doing Salamander 3, Dark Tooth Seism hyped for Gradius' 40th anniversary.

144
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like, there's a lot going on in that space, too.

145
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:31,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's lots of, like, I want to see, I think, was Mega Man 11 without the folks behind Mega Man?

146
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:35,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because there was the whole, yeah, he went and made, um...

147
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:36,887
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other game?

148
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:37,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Mighty No.

149
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:37,508
[SPEAKER_02]: 9.

150
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:41,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the infamous divorce from Capcom and all that.

151
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:43,419
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised.

152
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes studios can carry on with the same style of game and stuff.

153
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:52,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I did notice that the art style looks a little bit more detailed this time.

154
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember with Katamari, it was very flat, cel-shaded almost to the...

155
00:10:58,207 --> 00:10:59,889
[SPEAKER_05]: for all of the artwork.

156
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,674
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a little bit of details here and there, but it's similar enough.

157
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:07,859
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Katamari, the original, was a PlayStation 2 game.

158
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:12,345
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now in the era where... I'm assuming this is targeted at the original Nintendo Switch.

159
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's both Switch and Switch 2.

160
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:18,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Switch is still comparable to about a PS4, a little under a PS4.

161
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

162
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:32,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's you should see some even if it's cel shaded, you should see some graphical, you know, and I imagine what they were showing was probably switch to footage, which is going to run probably a better frame rate.

163
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:33,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, yeah.

164
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:34,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks good.

165
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's supposed to be out October 24th.

166
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:38,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

167
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:40,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very excited about that.

168
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:42,050
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

169
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for Bobby Blackwolf to have more break music from the Katamari soundtrack.

170
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, he only does Overclock remixes, though.

171
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

172
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: More music, more remixes.

173
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm still happy for the Overclock remix people to have more stuff to remix.

174
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:59,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, not a surprise whatsoever, Just Dance 2026 edition.

175
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, every year.

176
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:03,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no shit.

177
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:04,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

178
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:35,190
[SPEAKER_02]: if there wasn't a Just Dance game coming out this year I would say what's happening I want to be interested in Just Dance but I'm going to be honest it's connection to Ubisoft right now and everything that's going on at Ubisoft kind of makes me go it's got the ick like Just Dance has the ick right now I would rather picked up like a used copy of Just Dance for the PS3 or something than get this new thing I'm sorry but I'm also not sorry like there's just a lot of ick with Ubisoft right now

179
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:42,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has nothing to do with the hardworking people actually putting on their coding glasses and making the games.

180
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the fuckery going on at the top.

181
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:51,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Need to get like a Fortnite Dance Central game now that they own, you know, Harmonix essentially.

182
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:56,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just get Dance Central and spend that off into something.

183
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:56,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I can go for.

184
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

185
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Rock Band essentially.

186
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band 5 is in Fortnite essentially.

187
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if it didn't need to connect, I think Dance Central is pretty good.

188
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I don't know.

189
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

190
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:11,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played Just Dance before like a lot of years ago.

191
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:18,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

192
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't feel like you're getting much each year, but whatever.

193
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:22,299
[SPEAKER_05]: If people enjoy it, cool.

194
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:22,740
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

195
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:23,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not here to

196
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:24,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge what you enjoy.

197
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.

198
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So brand new fighting game coming to both the Switch and Switch 2.

199
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting ported over there November 14th.

200
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:42,155
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a brand new remake of Plants vs. Zombies with Plants vs. Zombies Replanted.

201
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,457
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also out on both systems as well.

202
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:44,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks great.

203
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of wondering what happened to this franchise.

204
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about PopCap the other day.

205
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:58,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how epic all those PopCap games used to be, and then EA kind of bought them, and they were going for a little bit, and we had the whole, it's Peggle 2, or was it Peggle 3?

206
00:13:58,798 --> 00:13:59,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

207
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a little dance on stage.

208
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised there hasn't been another Peggle yet.

209
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Peggle 2.

210
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:06,050
[SPEAKER_02]: PopCap's kind of faded.

211
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think Plant vs. Zombies, like, all just left.

212
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,675
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, they have the IP for it.

213
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:14,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you can't tell me that they couldn't get, like, a B or C team to put out another Peggle game?

214
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:14,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

215
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:18,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And why did we stop PopCap in the first place?

216
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:22,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, those games were really addictive and fun, and you would think a lot of it would translate well to mobile.

217
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand what happened there.

218
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:31,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe because they weren't built... I'm thinking back to Plants vs. Zombies.

219
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know about 2 too much.

220
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And they turned it into a first-person shooter?

221
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Garden Warfare?

222
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Garden Warfare is that.

223
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:46,292
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm saying those games are meant to be more of that business model where...

224
00:14:46,373 --> 00:15:09,782
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

225
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,699
[SPEAKER_05]: would have like a crap ton of monetization in it.

226
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,641
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, yeah, they could.

227
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure there's like three versions of Bejeweled on mobile.

228
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost positive that's a thing.

229
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled for sure.

230
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, because I can see that people would, they would want to keep that going because of the Candy Crush, you know, phenomenon and stuff.

231
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:31,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very similar.

232
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:38,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could see them doing that in like Zuma and I don't even know what else to say.

233
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:40,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, Zuma, what a throwback.

234
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So, lots of stuff.

236
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:44,112
[SPEAKER_05]: But, hey, you know what?

237
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:47,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we still have those old games on Steam, so that's great.

238
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,716
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, this looks pretty fun.

239
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to check this out again.

240
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,562
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming out October 23rd for both Switch and Switch 2.

241
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:01,147
[SPEAKER_05]: This I just didn't give a crap about because, you know, cool, it's coming to another console.

242
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,249
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Sports FC26.

243
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey, cool, you're going to get it for the Switch and Switch 2.

244
00:16:06,852 --> 00:16:10,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they don't treat it like they did with the previous Nintendo systems where you get this

245
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:32,166
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

246
00:16:32,281 --> 00:16:56,820
[SPEAKER_05]: We got another trailer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Evil Ace Chronicles And that's going to be coming out September 30th as well on Switch and Switch 2 I think it's also coming out on PlayStation Systems Oh yeah, that's been announced quite some time ago Yeah, for a while ago, yeah Persona 3 Reload coming to the Switch 2 as well, that's October 23rd Right in time for that to be delisted off Game Pass, by the way

247
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That's getting removed from Game Pass this month.

248
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's related.

249
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:07,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another trailer for Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment.

250
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when that's coming out yet, but at least we got a little bit more footage of that.

251
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Hyrule Warriors, so it should be good.

252
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:18,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Madden 2026 coming out to the Switch 2.

253
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,932
[SPEAKER_05]: This one was very strange.

254
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:24,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game called Chillin' by the Fire.

255
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a game where you make campfires.

256
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just the camera support with it feels like... It honestly feels like an early Xbox Live Arcade game.

257
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the way that it...

258
00:17:40,287 --> 00:18:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just weird like I don't know um like why I would hang out with people in front of like a campfire over a camera but okay it's a thing so you know that is out now you can check that out um Apex Legends coming to the Switch 2 as well so that's kind of a big deal I hope more of those free-to-play shooty bang bang games that's out uh this week so on the 5th

259
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I should try that, but I'm terrible at that game.

260
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks kind of intense.

261
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Hila, which is this mouse with a frog backpack.

262
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:23,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And you kind of do a lot of platforming and exploring.

263
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:26,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's coming out on, looks like, 2026.

264
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Looked pretty cool, based on that.

265
00:18:29,806 --> 00:18:32,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars Outlaws getting ported to the Switch 2 as well.

266
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,712
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming out September 4th.

267
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:40,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Chronos The New Dawn is going to be coming out September 5th.

268
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,126
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a Dead Space-looking game.

269
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Yakuza Kiwami 2 being ported to the Switch 2.

270
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:50,859
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming out November 13th.

271
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, apparently, the first Kiwami game as well is going to be coming out on that same day.

272
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands 4 being ported as well to the Switch 2.

273
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,034
[SPEAKER_05]: They also had some other games they showed off.

274
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:13,422
[SPEAKER_05]: NBA Bounce, Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Romancing Saga 2, and Shinobi Art of Vengeance all being ported to the Switch 2.

275
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:23,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And then kind of the last bit that we saw that was shown off by Square Enix are new games using that HD 2D engine.

276
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:27,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a brand new series that looks like The Adventures of Elliot.

277
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: The Millennium Tales That's on the Switch 2 next year But they have a demo out You can check that out I don't like that name at all With the double the I don't think it's a good name I think they should have just called the game Elliot It's just It's a weird name

278
00:19:46,090 --> 00:20:07,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Octopath Traveler Zero

279
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:26,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really love to see that Final Fantasy series any of it just put into this engine

280
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:26,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

281
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, any of, like, the one through six.

282
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just had, well, we just had the pixel remasters.

283
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:31,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care!

284
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that stopped anybody else.

285
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't.

286
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:39,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I mean, how many times have we had, was it, The Last of Us remade the last five years or whatever?

287
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:42,390
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's not a reason not to do it.

288
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say either another sequel...

289
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:49,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, like, we had a Final Fantasy IV The After Years.

290
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:53,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people would eat the fuck up out of a Final Fantasy VI too.

291
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:58,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people would lose their fucking minds if Square ever did a Final Fantasy VI too.

292
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,095
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems the most obvious.

293
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:06,503
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, II and III just weren't really released in America and have that same sort of, you know...

294
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't grow up on those games as much.

295
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy V kind of falls to the same thing.

296
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And IV already had a sequel.

297
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the original is really hard to do a direct sequel to.

298
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:21,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we already had Strangers of Paradise, spoiler alert, and some other things that were really in that same thing.

299
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:27,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Final Fantasy VI is most prime for a pixel sequel.

300
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Chrono Trigger's turn.

301
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the game that makes the most sense to do in this.

302
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:34,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

303
00:21:34,816 --> 00:21:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Me!

304
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:35,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Me!

305
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:36,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying this.

306
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you know what I would really want?

307
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,225
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I would really want from the Enix catalog?

308
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:43,869
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Terranigma trilogy?

309
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:46,793
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that whole stuff?

310
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion of Gaia and those guys.

311
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: They're action-based, so it'd be a little different.

312
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,701
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the games.

313
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:58,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Brain Lord, Terranigma, that's the series I would love to see in this.

314
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... I don't know.

315
00:21:59,812 --> 00:22:02,275
[SPEAKER_02]: If we got Live Alive, anything's possible, but...

316
00:22:02,255 --> 00:22:09,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger, so... It seems like it's time.

317
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:11,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe.

318
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

319
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's see.

320
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:15,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Go into chat.

321
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:20,473
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt says, can't wait for Legend of Octopath, Octopath to the past.

322
00:22:21,454 --> 00:22:22,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The Adventures of Elliot.

323
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:22,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked great.

324
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

325
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,579
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark2CS says, highly recommend the Shinobi demo.

326
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.

327
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:31,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby pointing out that the Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster did have one scene in that engine.

328
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:32,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looked great.

329
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, yeah.

330
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:39,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream says, the same guy who localized Pokemon, the English, did Terranigma 2.

331
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

332
00:22:40,477 --> 00:23:09,336
[SPEAKER_02]: that's pretty cool how about um Secret of Mana already I guess those games I guess we got Secrets of the Secret of Mana and then we had Visions of Mana right which was second to third I guess maybe uh no I'm Secret of Evermore that's what I meant Secret of Evermore is what I want to see but again I think that was a different engine they used for all that so yeah um yeah right Quest Buster, Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma in one package would rock absolutely

333
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

334
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:12,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

335
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the direct overall?

336
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:23,205
[SPEAKER_02]: My Blue Sky feed was kind of filled with very tepid sort of... It wasn't a great... I don't think people loved it.

337
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:29,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't really have high expectations for the partner directs usually, so it wasn't like I was expecting anything.

338
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:35,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just more of... I think I was just more excited about the whole Kanamari announcement, and then the rest was like, okay, that's fine.

339
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,448
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing really else I'm excited about.

340
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

341
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I wasn't looking to be excited by anything.

342
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was bad.

343
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:58,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just maybe lacked a lot of real surprises, and that is due to the nature of the Switch 2 being announced sort of off-cycle with all the other industry announcements, so this felt like there was a lot of catching up for

344
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:02,657
[SPEAKER_02]: are games coming out to other platforms that will also be coming out to Switch 2.

345
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:08,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So it took a little bit of the, ooh, this is a new thing, shiny, sort of factor out of it.

346
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, I think it lost a little bit of steam for some people.

347
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:17,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now that we've had this, the Switch 2 has kind of caught up with everybody else at this point.

348
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:27,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And now maybe when we get to things like the Game Awards in December, which I guess would probably be our next big announcement set, unless Nintendo does a first party thing for...

349
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

350
00:24:42,567 --> 00:25:00,863
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

351
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:09,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I would assume that Metroid Prime 4 is going to be that, you know, Friday before Thanksgiving week.

352
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:16,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we already have a date for Legends ZA, which I agree is going to be a huge title and it's going to be, you know, one of the reasons to own a Switch 2.

353
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that, actually, that game is on Switch and Switch 2.

354
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:21,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, to be fair, so would Metroid Prime 4.

355
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the bundle for that as well, for the Switch 2, where they're doing the same thing that they did with Mario Kart 4.

356
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:40,806
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's hard to say, it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo chooses to announce but I think then we'll get a lot more big games next year so we'll see

357
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:46,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, okay, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week.

358
00:25:46,348 --> 00:25:49,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, you were kind of referencing your gaming week earlier, but how was your gaming week?

359
00:25:49,574 --> 00:25:58,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I mean, it's basically the same as last week, so it's just been Minecraft and coding my data pack in Minecraft, so still working on that, slowly going along.

360
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost have the entire game loop done, I still have to debug everything, and

361
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Then add all this stuff in there.

362
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,925
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is I keep taking stuff in there and I'm like, oh, hey, cool, I can do this thing.

363
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it gets even more complicated and stuff.

364
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:19,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I was watching different Minecraft events that some of the people I know were in this week.

365
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:26,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wow, the stuff that they're doing in those data packs is even less advanced than the stuff I'm doing in this one.

366
00:26:26,222 --> 00:26:27,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

367
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:28,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but we'll see.

368
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:33,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get it done sooner than later because it's been like 30...

369
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:59,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

370
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:05,969
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week, honestly, truly, I have almost exclusively been playing Final Fantasy XI.

371
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:06,630
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

372
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when I brought that up last week?

373
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

374
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:11,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here's the thing, and I've learned a little more about this whole setup.

375
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm playing on a – and this is because of retro achievements.

376
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:27,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like – I discovered randomly one day that they had retro achievements for Final Fantasy XI, and I kind of was laughing going, oh, they've got to be impossible, like they were on the Xbox, like get to level 75 at every job and that sort of thing, right?

377
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:27,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

378
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was looking and I was like, well, how are they doing that anyway?

379
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:33,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it through like a PS2 emulator, but the servers are down?

380
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's actually this private system called Horizon.

381
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:40,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But Horizon is actually kind of trying to do its own thing with the game.

382
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very big, I guess, sort of private server.

383
00:27:43,737 --> 00:28:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

384
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:30,552
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.

385
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:35,361
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of doing one damage a tick, it does four damage a tick to make it a little bit more of a viable spell.

386
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And they adjusted some levels of some spells.

387
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: They just some little things just to try to bring, I think, a little bit of balance to the game.

388
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:47,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm shocked at how many people are actively playing like the servers.

389
00:28:47,542 --> 00:29:04,116
[SPEAKER_02]: and many more.

390
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:06,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the old days and all those sorts of things.

391
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just very impressed at kind of what they built.

392
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:17,918
[SPEAKER_02]: But the interesting thing is, even though it's a 75 experience, they do have some features that are from the newer expansions like level sync.

393
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:21,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Level sync didn't happen until like Abyssia.

394
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:24,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It was when they bumped to 99 that they brought in level sync.

395
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,635
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that makes the game better, really, because it makes it more people.

396
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:58,369
[SPEAKER_02]: because I thought I had my client in Steam but I got it through Amazon a long time ago and so I have the Final Fantasy XI Ultimate Collection Abyssia Edition yeah yeah that's what Alan bought me years ago because I was like I don't remember my play online login and it's tied to an email I can't access anymore so I don't know how the fuck I'm ever going to get these characters back and so he just bought me the Steam Edition because it was on sale for like 20 bucks for like everything and so I played to experience the book burning and everything new in the game but none of that is in

397
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,512
[SPEAKER_02]: This Horizon experience.

398
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just really neat to see what the community has built.

399
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:05,980
[SPEAKER_02]: The Discord is extremely active.

400
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's... Loki, I know you and I burned a lot of hours on that game back in the day.

401
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:19,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It is such a different experience when you have a Discord where the entire server is basically tied together, right?

402
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can do shouts and asks in Discord.

403
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, it's not... You can find things a lot faster.

404
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:26,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Wiki...

405
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:42,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

406
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: and the official strategy guide, it was a lot harder.

407
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:49,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, my nostalgia is definitely strong with Final Fantasy XI.

408
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:52,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long it'll last, but I'm enjoying it this week.

409
00:30:52,916 --> 00:31:00,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did get an achievement because there is an achievement for getting a crystal for the Krags.

410
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:00,806
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember the Krags?

411
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:04,350
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dem, Mea, what's the other one called?

412
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:10,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Hala, Hala, those crags, you get a crystal at the crag so you can teleport there, right?

413
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my, I got a crystal crag and I got an achievement.

414
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:18,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, with everybody like, teleport, teleport, teleport, you know.

415
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:23,051
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt says, so is it more doable solo or do you still need to depend on parties?

416
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:25,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to depend on parties.

417
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are a lot easier to find because they have the Discord and they have other sort of ways to try to find people.

418
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:35,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And keep in mind...

419
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:39,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ran into toxic people yet, but I haven't done a lot of partying.

420
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing to keep in mind.

421
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the audience that's going to be into Final Fantasy XI are people that were playing it originally when they were teenagers or in their 20s.

422
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the player base is like grown the fuck up.

423
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:55,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people in their late 30s and 40s that are mostly playing this.

424
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:57,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all, but mostly.

425
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think by nature with that, you get rid of a lot of the edgelords.

426
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Not completely, but mostly.

427
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:11,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, though, if you do want to do the solo type thing, then by all means, the original Final Fantasy XI is still a thing.

428
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: You can solo it.

429
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:18,984
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has a monthly fee, which again, Square, Square, Square, Enix, Enix, Enix, Square, Enix.

430
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:21,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bundle the XIV and the XI fees.

431
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:22,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a break.

432
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Paying for XIV should also give you access to XI.

433
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:32,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It would do you so much better in these times when Final Fantasy XIV has been losing a little bit of steam lately.

434
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

435
00:32:49,985 --> 00:33:08,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

436
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, just do a thing.

437
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:16,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, accomplish a little bit and just, you know, kind of explore and just go back to remembering what the game is.

438
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:24,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know that when they changed everything, like the meta as far as like where to level up, like completely changed when they did that.

439
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember like it was...

440
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, you... I mean, the first part's still okay, where you go, like, to... You have rabbits.

441
00:33:32,756 --> 00:33:37,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Near your starter towns, and then the desert, but then it's like, then you go to a cave.

442
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:39,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you go to Gusken Mines and burn books.

443
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Gusken Mines, yeah.

444
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't how it was in the original.

445
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:43,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's way different now.

446
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:45,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

447
00:33:45,335 --> 00:34:07,815
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh um I was gonna say with Horizon one of the other things I think is really interesting is that they actually have a remixed version of the soundtrack which I can kind of give or take the remixes of the city music and the music that was there originally and like um you know the starting zones like I'm just gonna be honest I maybe that my nostalgia bone kind of

448
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:27,340
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

449
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:53,479
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

450
00:34:53,459 --> 00:35:01,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I didn't really care for the remix, I do like what they did to their all-original songs to add a little something in the areas that didn't have them.

451
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would still have to go back and get that sound replacer thing to put the battle music in there.

452
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:08,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I think is really easy to do.

453
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's as hard as it was when PlayOnline... Because this whole thing strips out PlayOnline.

454
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:16,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You make your character on the web, and then it's waiting for you in the game.

455
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:19,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So it strips out PlayOnline completely.

456
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:20,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

457
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:47,833
[SPEAKER_02]: so I think it's a little easier to do that stuff oh and this thing embraces most add-ons there's like there's white listed add-ons and there's banned add-ons but all the white listed things are like mini maps things that are like quality of life that you know are not hurting the game to have it's like notorious monster snipers are the things that are in the banned add-ons they're very strict on real money trading so which of course they should be

458
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay, that's enough about that.

459
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,599
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say I did play a couple other games this week.

460
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:57,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to my friend's house the other night, and he has this really cool setup where he has two big TVs.

461
00:35:57,247 --> 00:36:07,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have not ever really experimented with this, but he does emulators and he'll do multiple emulators all running at the same time to play multiplayer online experiences.

462
00:36:08,223 --> 00:36:11,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were playing Resident Evil Outlast.

463
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:39,707
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:40,368
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is it.

465
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:40,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Disney.

466
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:41,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Outbreak, not Outlast.

467
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Outbreak.

468
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil Outbreak.

469
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:46,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that was fun.

470
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:47,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun to play it.

471
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:50,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We cleared two scenarios and had fun doing that.

472
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:54,822
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went over to the Dolphin emulator, which I never realized.

473
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:58,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know Dolphin has Game Boy Advance emulators built into it?

474
00:36:59,166 --> 00:36:59,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I never realized.

475
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:04,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I could see that because it's got the Game Boy player.

476
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:05,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come up in separate.

477
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:18,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I just never realized that was in there.

478
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:25,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have

479
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I should have figured that out.

480
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're going to have something to address that.

481
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:30,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

482
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:36,087
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain was always, oh, Dolphin's just focused on the emulation of like the, you know, GameCube and all that.

483
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:38,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, you know, the Wii and all that stuff.

484
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:40,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

485
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:40,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

486
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:41,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not alone.

487
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:43,661
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, didn't know Dolphin did that either.

488
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:44,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.

489
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:45,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the controllers.

490
00:37:46,286 --> 00:37:48,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's like a native...

491
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Advance emulator built in.

492
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:56,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I'm like, ooh, I want to play Animal Crossing and go to the island on that thing because that was always fun.

493
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,500
All right.

494
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for my gaming week.

495
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:02,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get into some news.

496
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a reminder, we will not be here in two weeks.

497
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:08,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be out of town on the 17th, but we will be back next week.

498
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,151
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura ought to be back as well.

499
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,533
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about all the gaming news that comes back in the next week.

500
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:16,317
[SPEAKER_02]: But until then, let's get to the news from this week.

501
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, in this ongoing saga, right?

502
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we have more updates regarding the whole Visa MasterCard blocking not safe for work games through the payment processors.

503
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:34,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little bit kind of a he said, she said type thing going on.

504
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:42,507
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially, you've got MasterCard, which put out a thing on their social media saying...

505
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:58,223
[SPEAKER_05]: clarifying recent headlines on gaming content and saying that MasterCard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms contrary to media reports and allegations.

506
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Our payment networks follow a standard base of rules of law.

507
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:08,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network.

508
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure

509
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:17,068
[SPEAKER_05]: MasterCard cards and, you know, that they'd hear to that stuff.

510
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:26,229
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is, though, Valve then elaborated on that as well, saying, well, hold on, that may not entirely be true.

511
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:27,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, um,

512
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: MasterCard did not communicate with Valve directly despite our request to do so.

513
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:40,589
[SPEAKER_05]: MasterCard communicated with our payment processor through and their acquiring banks.

514
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Payment processors communicated with this with Valve and we replied by outlining Steam's policy.

515
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:52,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution.

516
00:39:52,503 --> 00:40:02,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Payment processors rejected this and specifically cited MasterCard's rule 5.12.7 and the risk to MasterCard brand.

517
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:16,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently that rule states a merchant must not submit to its acquirer and a customer must not submit to interchange systems and transaction that is illegal in the sole discretion of the corporation may

518
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:20,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Damage the goodwill of corporations or reflect negatively on the marks.

519
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:24,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially saying that they can't sell a game that's going to make MasterCard look bad.

520
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:29,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't think anyone knows that MasterCard's behind a lot of this stuff anyways, and I don't think it really matters.

521
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great that Valve spoke up.

522
00:40:32,275 --> 00:41:02,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great that Valve spoke up.

523
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:17,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is.

524
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:29,080
[SPEAKER_02]: So y'all need to figure your morals out because it's not okay that books and movies and violence can play by one set of rules.

525
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But these other games that may have themes, which if it's a gross game to you, that's fine.

526
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:41,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's for you to be able to make that – or a parent to be able to make that determination about because for some people – some people find –

527
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,460
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't expect everybody to understand this.

528
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:51,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people find release and therapy in working through difficult themes that may or may not have impacted them personally.

529
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:55,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not your decision what to spend your money on at the end of the day.

530
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And that at the core is like the problem here is that it definitely has that appearance.

531
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about this a lot, right?

532
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:05,496
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what the facts are.

533
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:08,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in gaming is going to be what is perceived.

534
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:14,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And the perception that's happening here is that the credit card companies control what we can and can't buy.

535
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are not taking that anymore.

536
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:21,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, MissingNo says you don't see them blocking payments on OnlyFans.

537
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

538
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:24,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, or guns.

539
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:26,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I use my visa at the gun show?

540
00:42:26,968 --> 00:42:28,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I can.

541
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I use my visa at the gun show?

542
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:30,673
Nope.

543
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:57,690
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

544
00:42:58,193 --> 00:43:03,719
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to ask yourself what is a shitting table, it's not for you.

545
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go chasing waterfalls.

546
00:43:06,823 --> 00:43:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.

547
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:20,539
[SPEAKER_02]: But trust me, organizations like the one in Australia that got this ban would probably be horrified at these types of things and tell you that you can't have them.

548
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Helinski in chat says, Man, Rob, what are you into?

549
00:43:25,947 --> 00:43:34,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I am into going to the hard places to find the facts and analysis for you, the viewer and listener here on Orange Launch Radio.

550
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:37,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't fucking get it twisted, y'all.

551
00:43:39,638 --> 00:43:39,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

552
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, where were we at, Loki?

553
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:47,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so not only Steam, of course, was affected by all that.

554
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:56,162
[SPEAKER_05]: HIO, of course, was removing games off or delisting games and even blocking payments.

555
00:43:56,142 --> 00:44:09,932
[SPEAKER_05]: they're still kind of doing that but they are at least re-indexing the adult games that are free so they're doing that right now and they also said that they're working on getting a different payment processor

556
00:44:10,503 --> 00:44:21,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Strype is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners.

557
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:33,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite card networks generally supporting adult content with the appropriate registrations, Strype has indicated that they'll hope to be able to support adult content in the future.

558
00:44:35,427 --> 00:44:41,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think then if it isn't MasterCard, then you start naming names.

559
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:42,581
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, Stripe.

560
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:45,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now we start calling their customer service.

561
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:51,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they shouldn't be able to dictate speech.

562
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:52,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay in your lane.

563
00:44:54,142 --> 00:44:57,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Blake, once again, who pays attention to payment processors?

564
00:44:58,507 --> 00:44:59,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

565
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, unless it's PayPal, because PayPal sucks.

566
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:07,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, nobody is paying attention to, hmm, who are their payment processors on this website?

567
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:08,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Shame.

568
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no one cares.

569
00:45:12,384 --> 00:45:16,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, as a bit of, you know...

570
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: ProTest for this whole thing as well.

571
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:30,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Good Old Games is basically launching a website called FreedomToBuy.Games to raise awareness on censorship in gaming.

572
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:37,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, they have offered up 15 games for free.

573
00:45:37,055 --> 00:45:42,263
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say that GOG is kind of the ambulance chaser of the gaming industry.

574
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And get your coin, do what you need to do, but GOG is kind of the ambulance chaser.

575
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:53,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean, you know, they're the lawyers behind the ambulance trying to, you know, something wrong, call Anne Fong, that type of thing.

576
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, what they're...

577
00:45:55,904 --> 00:46:22,418
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

578
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are talking about them and giving them a free ad.

579
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing what they need to do, but like, girl, I see you.

580
00:46:29,408 --> 00:46:30,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, oh girl, GOG.

581
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, oh girl, I see you.

582
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, oh girl, she's at it again.

583
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:38,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, oh girl, she saw a headline and now she's got to do something about it.

584
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,965
[SPEAKER_02]: That's GOG.

585
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:42,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

586
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:50,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so... So basically, you know, yeah, it does seem like there's a lot of, like, grasping for attention, but...

587
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Free is free.

588
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:54,224
[SPEAKER_02]: But free is free.

589
00:46:55,285 --> 00:47:01,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want Postal 2 and a bunch of anime booby games, they're free for another three hours.

590
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, three hours.

591
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:06,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to get them now on those of you that are listening live.

592
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:19,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably out of time, but stay tuned for whatever Girl, Oh Girl does next because, you know, they're going to chase the headlines.

593
00:47:19,156 --> 00:47:20,518
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to chase the clout.

594
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, she's making a scene again?

595
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:26,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, oh girl.

596
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

597
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:33,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about what's going on at EVO.

598
00:47:33,707 --> 00:47:35,069
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, EVO is the thing.

599
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:39,216
[SPEAKER_02]: EVO is going on right now, and there are some updates going on over there.

600
00:47:40,117 --> 00:47:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's talk about some things that have happened at the show.

601
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:45,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of you in chat might have some other updates for me.

602
00:47:45,345 --> 00:47:49,071
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things I have so far, but some stuff may have come up tonight as we're taping.

603
00:47:49,051 --> 00:48:15,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtua Fighter 5

604
00:48:15,578 --> 00:48:35,562
[SPEAKER_02]: VIRTUA FIGHTER 5 REVO

605
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:40,609
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be automatically updated if you own that to the world stage version.

606
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:46,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you own Virtua Fighter Ultimate Showdown on PlayStation 4, you can update for a discounted price of $9.99.

607
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:50,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just, you know, this is the ultimate edition.

608
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:59,253
[SPEAKER_02]: As we see oftentimes in the fighting game world, this should not really be new information to anybody that follows fighting games.

609
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:04,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, TigerClaw says, they say it's the PlayStation 2 version of the Mortal Kombat trilogy.

610
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:07,541
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Capcom Fighting Collection 2?

611
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:14,091
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty fun, a good collection, and they're going to be doing a free title update, and it's going live this week.

612
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:17,937
[SPEAKER_02]: New content and improvements, including some remix tracks.

613
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:25,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper is also getting four new characters, and of course the collection itself already has eight games in it.

614
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:32,700
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're late to the party, then take note that you'll be getting some extra little upgrades with this.

615
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 6 DLC.

616
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:36,404
[SPEAKER_02]: A brand new character was announced.

617
00:49:36,444 --> 00:49:40,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the biggest non-surprise ever because they've been hinting at this for a while.

618
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:44,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But Crimson Viper, Sea Viper, is going to be added to the roster for Street Fighter 6.

619
00:49:45,092 --> 00:49:46,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone surprised?

620
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:46,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Me neither.

621
00:49:47,294 --> 00:49:49,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Fatal Fury, City of the Wolves.

622
00:49:49,516 --> 00:49:50,657
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty cool.

623
00:49:50,677 --> 00:49:54,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury is getting Ken, as in Street Fighters.

624
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken is coming to that.

625
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:57,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not Barbie.

626
00:49:59,906 --> 00:50:02,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, now that you said that...

627
00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:26,363
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

628
00:50:26,765 --> 00:50:36,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw also points out one of the main things they talked about with Mortal Kombat Trilogy is Shang Tsung's morphine will be fixed because in the original it was causing lag because it was loading from the disc.

629
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I remember that.

630
00:50:39,961 --> 00:51:00,417
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

631
00:51:01,814 --> 00:51:03,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus the souped up system probably helps as well.

632
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger Claw also wants to point out they revealed Battle Beast as a playable character in Invincible Versus.

633
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:11,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of new character announcements.

634
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:14,613
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be more before the show is done because I think Evo is still going.

635
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it wraps up tonight.

636
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:20,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But we may get a couple big announcements or two still before it's all done.

637
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:23,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we hear anything live, we'll break in and announce it.

638
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:26,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we'll go to our next story, which is...

639
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: We all knew it was coming, right, Loki?

640
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:29,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a surprise.

641
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:38,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've already seen this before the Switch 2 launched, but now we're getting more updates as, of course, tariffs and all that stuff change.

642
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:51,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of that, prices are going up on Switch accessories, Alarmo, Amiibo, but not the Switch 2 system, at least.

643
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:59,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, basically all of the accessories and whatnot are going up in price.

644
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would include Switch 2 accessories.

645
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:03,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Joy-Con and stuff.

646
00:52:03,783 --> 00:52:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though we're saying the Switch 2 system isn't going up in price, the accessories are, which still does have an impact.

647
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:28,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so these include, was it the Nintendo Switch OLED model, the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, select Nintendo Switch accessories, Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select Amiibo, the Alarmo, and yeah, I think that... I thought Alarmo was one of those things that they only put out limited time.

648
00:52:28,666 --> 00:52:29,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize you could even still get one.

649
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:33,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was like those game watches and the classic consoles.

650
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I never realized they were still selling them, to be quite honest.

651
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:54,222
[SPEAKER_05]: um yeah so they had they had all that and of course uh they i think they released that information via the nintendo today app so i gotta you know control that narrative but i mean we know why it's not a surprise it's not like they're trying to be greedy here it's just

652
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:57,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, prices of other consoles went up too.

653
00:52:57,734 --> 00:52:58,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we ever get Sony prices?

654
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:00,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we got Microsoft prices in Greece.

655
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we get Sony ones?

656
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:02,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

657
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:05,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they did it before all that tariff stuff started happening.

658
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:07,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain countries.

659
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:11,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

660
00:53:11,195 --> 00:53:14,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but still, I mean, we knew this was coming.

661
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, elections, consequences, etc, etc.

662
00:53:19,878 --> 00:53:27,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if you don't like it, let your representative know not that it's going to change a damn thing, but it's nice to think it might.

663
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:30,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've already sold 6 million Switch 2s.

664
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, pricing isn't necessarily slowing people down from getting a Switch 2.

665
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:38,300
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hoping to sell 15 by the end.

666
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,664
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Switch 1 prices going up, they're just going to sell more Switch 2s.

667
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at this point, why would you get an OLED Switch when you can just get a Switch 2?

668
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:49,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it does have a better screen, but I just don't... For now.

669
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:54,398
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, it's not a deal breaker for me, but maybe a deal breaker for somebody else.

670
00:53:54,378 --> 00:54:01,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, so they're hoping to sell 50 million by March 2026, so the end of the financial year.

671
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:04,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I don't know.

672
00:54:04,692 --> 00:54:06,454
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably do it.

673
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:10,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll sell lots this holiday, I'm sure.

674
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:15,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless something really insane happens or like 500 million percent tariffs.

675
00:54:16,707 --> 00:54:22,495
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as long as nothing stupid like that happens, I think they should be fine.

676
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:25,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think is ever a guarantee that it won't.

677
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:26,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

678
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:29,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the PlayStation 6.

679
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:30,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

680
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,193
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go ahead and talk about the PlayStation 6.

681
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors and speculation.

682
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:34,419
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

683
00:54:34,439 --> 00:54:35,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Our favorite.

684
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:36,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors and speculation.

685
00:54:36,545 --> 00:54:37,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.

686
00:54:37,347 --> 00:54:37,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't...

687
00:54:37,949 --> 00:55:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: MorsLawIsDead

688
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:27,497
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's apparently information that came from a leaked AMD presentation to Sony back in 2023 so because it's a couple years old some of this may still have changed it's not all necessarily set in stone it's all rumors in the first place but so so take it with the gigantic um salt that it's needs to be um

689
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:54,531
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

690
00:55:54,511 --> 00:56:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So the leaks in this are saying that the company is going to be prioritizing lower power output to keep costs in line with previous generations for the PlayStation 6.

691
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:14,055
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're trying to not up the price for this and they're going to lower the power output because the older PlayStations can be a little bit of jet engine sometimes.

692
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're saying that in the PlayStation 6, there will be three times the rasterization.

693
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:21,145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 3D rendering.

694
00:56:21,485 --> 00:56:27,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's in comparison to the base PlayStation 5 and twice what the PlayStation 5 Pro has right now.

695
00:56:27,653 --> 00:56:36,125
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also saying that there will be backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4, which makes sense because I think that was the last time they changed the main chipset, right, Loki?

696
00:56:36,165 --> 00:56:37,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not having the same...

697
00:56:37,627 --> 00:57:01,002
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

698
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:10,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently indicating that they want to tap into success that the PlayStation 4 had, and part of that was because of the lower price that it had.

699
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:11,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's where things get interesting.

700
00:57:12,215 --> 00:57:14,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Sony is also working on a handheld.

701
00:57:15,158 --> 00:57:19,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard this before, that Sony may be coming back into the handheld game.

702
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:28,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently, this PlayStation 6 handheld will have a microSD slot, a touchscreen, haptic vibrations, and dual microphones.

703
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:29,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

704
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:38,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the PlayStation 6 handheld would be better than what we see with the Xbox Ally X. And there'll also be a USB-C port for video out.

705
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:44,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So it almost sounds like maybe some type of like Switch adjacent sort of thing.

706
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, technology in this thing.

707
00:57:49,323 --> 00:57:49,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

708
00:57:49,644 --> 00:57:50,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

709
00:57:50,725 --> 00:57:51,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

710
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,529
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, especially with cloud and all this, who knows?

711
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

712
00:57:54,991 --> 00:58:09,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm not surprised to hear that PlayStation might try to get back into this handheld thing a little bit, especially considering the success that Nintendo's had on that front and that the Switch system works for them.

713
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I just, I hope...

714
00:58:12,143 --> 00:58:13,465
[SPEAKER_02]: as Jonah and Matt says.

715
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:15,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OLR, PSP, HD remake?

716
00:58:15,527 --> 00:58:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that depends on what they let people build for it.

717
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:24,699
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sony would have to support the hardware a little longer than they usually do.

718
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know Sony's track record with supporting hardware is mediocre at best.

719
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:34,472
[SPEAKER_02]: They also need to come up with things that make a lot more fucking sense than PSNear

720
00:58:34,452 --> 00:58:42,966
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of these things that they tried to do with the handhelds that were like you had to have a manual to explain it to somebody and that didn't work in their favor.

721
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:53,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's an interesting direction especially when technologically we may have hit the point about as far as we can go with that.

722
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:54,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

723
00:58:54,466 --> 00:59:12,762
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

724
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:15,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, PlayStation 6.

725
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:16,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

726
00:59:16,892 --> 00:59:20,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we need to say much more about it now because it's too early.

727
00:59:21,116 --> 00:59:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see the facts later on.

728
00:59:22,478 --> 00:59:24,340
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting to hear what they might be doing.

729
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And the handheld thing is fascinating to me.

730
00:59:26,903 --> 00:59:30,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people would love for Sony to get back into the handheld business.

731
00:59:30,907 --> 00:59:31,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

732
00:59:31,608 --> 00:59:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: As critical as I am of how they handled some things, I'd love to see it.

733
00:59:35,232 --> 00:59:35,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

734
00:59:35,893 --> 00:59:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

735
00:59:36,434 --> 00:59:38,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, another direct this week.

736
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:46,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so THQ Nordic had their direct showcase showing off some of the stuff coming out in 2025.

737
00:59:46,674 --> 00:59:48,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have a few games that look pretty cool.

738
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:54,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Spongebob Squarepants Titans of the Tide with David Hasselhoff in there.

739
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,678
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome, just like the movie in the show.

740
00:59:59,738 --> 01:00:18,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Tides of Tomorrow Wreck Nation Wreck Nation

741
01:00:20,005 --> 01:00:48,375
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

742
01:00:48,693 --> 01:00:59,783
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're going to be releasing, Gothic 1 Remake, and I believe they said Gothic 1 through 3 is going to be hitting Game Pass pretty soon, so look for that.

743
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:03,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Really cool looking game called The Eternal Life of Goldman.

744
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:15,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like a twisted looking thing, but it's a 2D platformer that blends, I guess, dark fairy tales, myths, and mystery, they say.

745
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks interesting.

746
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:22,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminded me a lot of... Oh gosh, what was the old...

747
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:24,172
[SPEAKER_05]: 2D platforming.

748
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:25,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember now.

749
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:28,517
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one on Xbox Live Arcade that was pretty similar.

750
01:01:28,557 --> 01:01:29,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminded me.

751
01:01:29,738 --> 01:01:30,739
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it looks really cool.

752
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,921
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

753
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:33,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Titan Quest 2.

754
01:01:35,144 --> 01:01:37,567
[SPEAKER_05]: They said early access is now starting.

755
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:39,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

756
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:42,773
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Guild Europa 1410.

757
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:47,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a world building dynasty sim game.

758
01:01:47,823 --> 01:01:51,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Re-Animal looks very strange.

759
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:55,697
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from the creators of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2.

760
01:01:56,098 --> 01:01:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a co-op horror adventure game.

761
01:02:00,025 --> 01:02:01,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's creepy looking.

762
01:02:01,768 --> 01:02:04,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like Little Nightmares, but...

763
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Traumatizing, I guess.

764
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:09,065
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Fate Keeper that looks pretty awesome.

765
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:12,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of an Elder Scrolls type RPG game.

766
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:13,711
[SPEAKER_05]: First person.

767
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:17,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost looks like they mixed a little bit of Souls-like into it as well.

768
01:02:17,897 --> 01:02:18,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interested.

769
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:19,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.

770
01:02:19,299 --> 01:02:21,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, Darksiders 4.

771
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:25,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be pretty incredible as well.

772
01:02:26,247 --> 01:02:27,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of stuff.

773
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:36,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Fate Keeper looks interesting, Re-Animal, and I think the Eternal Life of Goldman are ones I'd be checking out.

774
01:02:36,259 --> 01:02:47,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned a few games in there coming to Game Pass pretty soon, and as we know, Game Pass has been having a lot of big hits that have made its way to Game Pass lately, and Game Pass is making money.

775
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:53,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently in the latest fiscal year, Game Pass hit $5 billion in revenue.

776
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:55,441
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 500 million active users.

777
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:56,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty

778
01:02:56,082 --> 01:02:57,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild, actually.

779
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:02,390
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole revenue from Microsoft of $76.4 billion.

780
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:05,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up 18% over last year.

781
01:03:05,954 --> 01:03:13,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this all is coming after the fact that Microsoft has laid off a shitload of people, which is really unfortunate.

782
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:15,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

783
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:19,812
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of makes this news kind of fucked up, honestly.

784
01:03:19,832 --> 01:03:22,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That like, look at all this money Game Pass is making.

785
01:03:22,596 --> 01:03:23,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to let people go.

786
01:03:25,816 --> 01:03:33,767
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a form that they file called a 10K that talks about how the money is coming out of Microsoft.

787
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:47,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've added another $2 billion on gaming revenue, and this is being credited to growth in Xbox content and services and offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.

788
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:53,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though console sales have fallen 25%, Microsoft is seeing increases from gaming.

789
01:03:53,693 --> 01:04:00,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, it should be noted that is coming alongside the news that they canceled game project.

790
01:04:00,605 --> 01:04:02,928
[SPEAKER_02]: They laid off people that were working on games.

791
01:04:02,949 --> 01:04:04,271
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things to keep in mind.

792
01:04:05,974 --> 01:04:14,588
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in their statement, they do say we continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators.

793
01:04:14,568 --> 01:04:23,362
[SPEAKER_02]: These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first and third party titles.

794
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're not going to tell you about all the stuff they canceled and closed.

795
01:04:26,426 --> 01:04:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're here to do to remind you.

796
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:38,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it is, again, an interesting sort of side by side that is kind of fucked up, but...

797
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, I guess, where this leads.

798
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:51,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as frustrating as all this news is about the layoffs and the canceled game projects, it's hard to deny that Game Pass is on fire right now, which is what Microsoft wants.

799
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:56,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be interesting for what will be in the future for Game Pass.

800
01:04:56,141 --> 01:05:01,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of sucks that certain projects that were in Game Pass's future will no longer be coming.

801
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:05,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess these numbers are maybe making Microsoft feel that they aren't needed.

802
01:05:06,113 --> 01:05:07,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

803
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

804
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the bumper.

805
01:05:29,628 --> 01:05:37,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

806
01:05:37,515 --> 01:05:39,823
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

807
01:05:40,428 --> 01:05:43,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Except Jamie is not going to do it tonight because she's not here.

808
01:05:43,551 --> 01:05:45,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know who is here is Loki.

809
01:05:46,054 --> 01:05:49,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Loki's turn to pick a classic game of the week.

810
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:49,998
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

811
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:51,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really overdue.

812
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had enough notice this time.

813
01:05:53,882 --> 01:05:55,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So Loki was able to pick.

814
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:59,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I can say about this pick is it is something I am not surprised at all.

815
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:02,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more surprised that this game is 10 years old than the fact that Loki picked it.

816
01:06:02,952 --> 01:06:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the greatest of all time.

817
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Goat Simulator.

818
01:06:09,217 --> 01:06:28,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

819
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:38,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, as with that, they released the trailer kind of showing off some of the stupid things that they were doing with this concept.

820
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone's like, I need this now.

821
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, oh, okay, well...

822
01:06:44,452 --> 01:07:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the Goat Mayhem.

823
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:12,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of like a Tony Hawk Pro Skater type scoring system with that.

824
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:21,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you play a goat named Pilgor and you are in charge of making everybody's lives miserable.

825
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:26,593
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a giant tongue that you can stick the things and pull things around.

826
01:07:26,973 --> 01:07:28,696
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bounce off of stuff.

827
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:29,897
[SPEAKER_05]: You can crash into things.

828
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:31,840
[SPEAKER_05]: You can explode and ragdoll.

829
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,022
[SPEAKER_05]: All sorts of craziness.

830
01:07:33,462 --> 01:07:38,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And then throughout the game, of course, you can unlock different mutators that give you different powers.

831
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:46,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of those, of course, there's a demon goat, which causes these goats to fall from the sky.

832
01:07:48,323 --> 01:07:51,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get different animals you can play as.

833
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,629
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all called goats.

834
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example, there's Tall Goat, which is just a giraffe.

835
01:07:57,355 --> 01:07:59,278
[SPEAKER_05]: There's...

836
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:02,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ostrich, which I think is like the feathered goat.

837
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,303
[SPEAKER_05]: They have another one that's a whale.

838
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:06,387
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ridiculous.

839
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:09,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But it kept going on and on.

840
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:13,642
[SPEAKER_05]: They kept adding different expansions to it as well.

841
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:18,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did everything from...

842
01:08:18,513 --> 01:08:26,293
[SPEAKER_05]: releasing like a Skyrim type piece of content that you can play.

843
01:08:26,313 --> 01:08:29,341
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the RPG simulator thing where you can be a microwave.

844
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:31,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you Fus Ro Dah with a goat?

845
01:08:31,709 --> 01:08:32,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

846
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:33,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

847
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:35,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's actually one of them that's in there that you can get.

848
01:08:36,255 --> 01:08:38,118
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in the Vanilla game, actually.

849
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that mutator.

850
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: They had, was it the Queen of Goats?

851
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,811
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a Sonic the Hedgehog spin thing that you could do.

852
01:08:47,831 --> 01:08:53,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was one that was like a Yoshi mutator that you could eat things and then make eggs.

853
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,621
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of crazy stuff.

854
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:56,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Jetpacks.

855
01:08:56,903 --> 01:09:02,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but it was a fun game where there's lots of collectibles, lots of, like, stuff to try to compete.

856
01:09:03,456 --> 01:09:05,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it was buggy.

857
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:09,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It was extremely buggy and crashed a lot.

858
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:17,443
[SPEAKER_05]: But thankfully, they just recently remade that, so you can check out the remake, which came out last November, but...

859
01:09:17,423 --> 01:09:23,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd highly recommend playing that version over the original because the original very, very, very, very buggy.

860
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very easy to break that game.

861
01:09:27,273 --> 01:09:28,774
[SPEAKER_05]: But very fun.

862
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:30,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And I highly recommend you check it out.

863
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:33,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, of course, their second game, Goat Simulator 3.

864
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:34,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know.

865
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,661
[SPEAKER_05]: The joke is there isn't a 2.

866
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:37,843
[SPEAKER_05]: That is out as well.

867
01:09:38,023 --> 01:09:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a big expansion that they put out for it.

868
01:09:40,546 --> 01:09:44,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another expansion for that coming very soon as well.

869
01:09:44,349 --> 01:09:45,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have to look forward to that.

870
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:46,992
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

871
01:09:46,972 --> 01:09:49,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic game of the week, Goat Simulator.

872
01:09:49,816 --> 01:09:53,280
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound so giddy to finally be able to add that one to the list.

873
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

874
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:55,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

875
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It is such a good game.

876
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:59,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I have wasted a lot of time in that.

877
01:09:59,588 --> 01:10:05,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And the best part about the original one on Steam has Steam Workshop support.

878
01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:06,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

879
01:10:06,738 --> 01:10:08,780
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes a buggy game even better?

880
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Mods.

881
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:11,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

882
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:11,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of mods.

883
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of mods.

884
01:10:13,718 --> 01:10:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Alan loves mods too.

885
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:16,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching him mod.

886
01:10:16,681 --> 01:10:18,784
[SPEAKER_02]: What was he modding this last week?

887
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:20,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have actually been Skyrim.

888
01:10:20,946 --> 01:10:24,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's back on that now that we got the new video cards.

889
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:26,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, I want to throw all the things at Skyrim.

890
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good times.

891
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:34,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know, because someone brought up, oh, aka the Asshole Goat game.

892
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:41,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know that the Untitled Goose game was going to have an animated series?

893
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,472
[SPEAKER_05]: They even did a pilot for it

894
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:44,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It was great.

895
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:47,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I really wish they had gone through with it.

896
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:48,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it on YouTube or something?

897
01:10:49,221 --> 01:10:50,843
[SPEAKER_05]: It is on YouTube, yeah.

898
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:54,408
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of pilots on YouTube that are fun.

899
01:10:54,428 --> 01:10:58,895
[SPEAKER_02]: The Elvira TV show has a pilot on YouTube.

900
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:00,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It is really funny, actually.

901
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:04,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really wish that there was the Untitled Goose thing.

902
01:11:04,924 --> 01:11:09,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll get a new Untitled Goose game at some point, but...

903
01:11:09,507 --> 01:11:11,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was really good.

904
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:13,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think of what other random ass pilots I've seen on YouTube.

905
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:18,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the absolutely fabulous American version because I did not realize that what's her name?

906
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:22,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Catherine Han from...

907
01:11:22,957 --> 01:11:27,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Wanda, Agatha, Agatha Long, WandaVision.

908
01:11:27,261 --> 01:11:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Agatha Long was in that with Kristen Johnston.

909
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not realize it was her in the American pilot, but it was bad.

910
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:34,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not because of her.

911
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:37,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, that's a very hard thing to Americanize.

912
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:42,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw a pilot for, you know, Clarissa Explains It All.

913
01:11:42,177 --> 01:11:43,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know they were going to turn that?

914
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:48,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they were going to do like a Clarissa is an adult ABC series?

915
01:11:48,303 --> 01:12:13,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember that.

916
01:12:13,092 --> 01:12:15,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all this chat, SJ100Mass says, I remember that series.

917
01:12:16,236 --> 01:12:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all on YouTube.

918
01:12:17,217 --> 01:12:21,782
[SPEAKER_02]: All those pilots are there, unless they finally copyrighted them down, but I don't think so.

919
01:12:21,802 --> 01:12:23,764
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of pilots and things you can find on YouTube.

920
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:39,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I went on a YouTube rabbit hole this week, and there was some internet commentators that were making fun of it, but apparently Six Flags tried to do their own 90s show.

921
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:39,623
Yeah.

922
01:12:40,413 --> 01:12:43,898
[SPEAKER_05]: is the cringiest thing I've ever seen.

923
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:50,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an MTV News type thing, but just it's so bad.

924
01:12:50,188 --> 01:12:50,969
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so bad.

925
01:12:51,089 --> 01:12:54,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Fifth Dream in chat says, two words, American Red Dwarf pilot.

926
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:56,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That's four words, Fifth Dream.

927
01:12:56,697 --> 01:12:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do you one worse.

928
01:12:58,901 --> 01:13:03,167
[SPEAKER_02]: American IT crowd remake.

929
01:13:03,187 --> 01:13:04,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Joel McHale couldn't save that.

930
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:05,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so bad.

931
01:13:05,811 --> 01:13:06,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so bad.

932
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, Loki.

933
01:13:08,755 --> 01:13:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: A rapid fire answer.

934
01:13:09,536 --> 01:13:09,897
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

935
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:13,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Peak just got a recent update.

936
01:13:13,994 --> 01:13:17,078
[SPEAKER_05]: So Peak is that kind of mountain climbing co-op game.

937
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:25,947
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be silly, because it is a mountain climbing survival game, you're supposed to be like a troop of like Boy Scouts or whatever.

938
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:30,131
[SPEAKER_05]: So they put out a release.

939
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:32,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hey guys, totally normal update to the game.

940
01:13:33,354 --> 01:13:34,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to see here.

941
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of the...

942
01:13:36,758 --> 01:13:40,264
[SPEAKER_05]: The list of changes is added cannibalism.

943
01:13:40,364 --> 01:13:48,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So now apparently if you are your stamina is just, you know, pretty empty, you're going to start hallucinating.

944
01:13:48,537 --> 01:13:56,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you'll do the whole Looney Tunes thing where the other players start looking like walking like pieces of meat or chicken or something like that.

945
01:13:57,272 --> 01:14:00,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can eat them and you get all your stamina back.

946
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:05,493
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so disgusting but funny.

947
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious.

948
01:14:06,755 --> 01:14:11,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so, yes, as if players, they start hallucinating.

949
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:12,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get on this.

950
01:14:12,563 --> 01:14:13,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to buy this Peek game.

951
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

952
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:15,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is a fun game.

953
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:16,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do I want to play Peek with?

954
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf for sure because he'll get so frustrated.

955
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:22,336
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll rage quit.

956
01:14:22,356 --> 01:14:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

957
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:24,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else do I want to play Peak with?

958
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:25,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

959
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some... Oh, if Extifer is willing to play.

960
01:14:28,567 --> 01:14:30,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I need people that scream when they play their video games.

961
01:14:31,412 --> 01:14:35,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe Extifer would be a good one if he's willing to make a return to the internet.

962
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:37,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tricky.

963
01:14:37,463 --> 01:14:42,792
[SPEAKER_05]: It does get pretty hard, but it is funny trying to help your friends and then stuff goes wrong, obviously.

964
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:43,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

965
01:14:45,117 --> 01:14:45,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

966
01:14:46,351 --> 01:15:15,413
[SPEAKER_05]: and then along with that other great news kind of just shadow dropped but Mario Paint made it out onto the Nintendo Switch Online SNES library it is on both the Switch and Switch 2 what is unique about this though is on the Switch 2 obviously it uses the mouse support that the Joy-Cons can do on the Switch 1 you have to use a USB mouse

967
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually plug in a USB mouse into that.

968
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if there's more games that support mouse controls using a USB mouse.

969
01:15:22,854 --> 01:15:24,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny you say that.

970
01:15:24,297 --> 01:15:26,240
[SPEAKER_02]: They did add it to other games later in the week.

971
01:15:26,361 --> 01:15:28,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not be in whatever you're looking at, but they did.

972
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:32,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how they had put out a few things like Nobunaga's Ambition on Super Nintendo?

973
01:15:32,172 --> 01:15:33,174
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out a few games.

974
01:15:33,194 --> 01:15:34,897
[SPEAKER_02]: They did add it for those games too.

975
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:35,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.

976
01:15:35,799 --> 01:15:36,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That came later in the week.

977
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:40,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so yeah, you can play Mario Paint.

978
01:15:40,454 --> 01:15:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's my question for you, Loki.

979
01:15:42,095 --> 01:15:47,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you love this Rob Stradamus meme we have here in the show that the chat has going about these predictions that I make.

980
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:56,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I did say that Mario Paint, I did say it would be a good launch title, like a new Mario Paint would be a good packing game.

981
01:15:56,328 --> 01:16:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did say as part of that, that Mario Paint should come out on the Switch, you know, Nintendo Switch Online.

982
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:07,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I get credit when it's six minutes, or not six minutes, six weeks past

983
01:16:07,638 --> 01:16:09,021
[SPEAKER_02]: The Switch's launch?

984
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:09,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

985
01:16:09,883 --> 01:16:12,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's still close enough.

986
01:16:13,131 --> 01:16:18,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, it feels like they should be making a second Mario Paint game.

987
01:16:18,143 --> 01:16:19,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see a Switch 2 Mario Paint.

988
01:16:20,168 --> 01:16:22,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it seems like such an obvious thing.

989
01:16:22,943 --> 01:16:29,655
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do end up announcing one for next year, I'm taking the full point, even if I miss the launch.

990
01:16:29,675 --> 01:16:30,016
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

991
01:16:30,036 --> 01:16:32,681
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says it's still the launch window.

992
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:34,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point, PodCulture.

993
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:34,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

994
01:16:35,326 --> 01:16:35,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

995
01:16:35,766 --> 01:16:38,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You just watch my wording next time.

996
01:16:38,872 --> 01:16:39,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's close enough.

997
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:41,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what, a month out?

998
01:16:41,336 --> 01:16:42,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take the point.

999
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob has gained one point in ego.

1000
01:16:47,193 --> 01:16:47,513
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1001
01:16:47,593 --> 01:16:53,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and if you think about it, what it's only been two weeks since the whole Donkey Kong game came out.

1002
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:57,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And technically that was advertised as kind of a launch window game.

1003
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:59,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So like it's not too far out.

1004
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:01,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we love to move the goalposts.

1005
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:03,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1006
01:17:03,052 --> 01:17:03,373
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1007
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1008
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:05,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What did I want to talk about?

1009
01:17:05,415 --> 01:17:07,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how about PlayStation Plus games?

1010
01:17:08,259 --> 01:17:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you know, you get free games every month.

1011
01:17:11,982 --> 01:17:15,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you getting starting August 5th for the months of August?

1012
01:17:15,307 --> 01:17:17,751
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting DayZ on PlayStation 4.

1013
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:18,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this one.

1014
01:17:18,612 --> 01:17:19,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Survival games.

1015
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:24,702
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 players have to endure together, you know, except there's zombies and stuff.

1016
01:17:24,722 --> 01:17:28,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful because there are no checkpoints and no save points.

1017
01:17:28,407 --> 01:17:29,829
[SPEAKER_02]: When you die, you are dead.

1018
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:30,210
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1019
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of bang your head against the wall, difficult...

1020
01:17:34,156 --> 01:17:39,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Grind Games, Lies of P for PlayStation 5 and 4 is also coming.

1021
01:17:39,204 --> 01:17:41,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you love Souls-like games, right?

1022
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:45,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy Lies of P for free with your PlayStation Plus subscription.

1023
01:17:45,393 --> 01:17:52,184
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have, if you want something a little bit, I guess, on the lighter side, My Hero 1's Justice 2 for the PlayStation 4.

1024
01:17:52,905 --> 01:18:02,880
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, of course, the follow-up to the Arena Fighter, My Hero 1's Justice, and you get character quirks and you go head-to-head in battles in big arenas.

1025
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:30,914
[SPEAKER_02]: so check that out or just don't forget to add them to your library and you know just an FYI that means last month's games are almost out the door so if you've not yet added like Diablo 4 was is one of the games for this month if you did not yet add those to your library you're literally on your last chance get on that before Tuesday so all right well if the PlayStation Plus games aren't of interest to you maybe you can go buy yourself a new game let's check out world release dates Loki what's coming out in the U.S.

1035
01:19:14,444 --> 01:19:15,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you meant Hello Kitty.

1036
01:19:15,746 --> 01:19:17,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were endorsing Hello Kitty.

1037
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:18,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, fuck yeah.

1038

[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck yeah, Loki plus Hello Kitty forever.

1039
01:19:20,953 --> 01:19:24,438

1040
01:19:24,458 --> 01:19:33,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Turbo Kid is a Metroidvania game based off of the cult film Turbo Kid, which is like an 80s post-apocalyptic movie with BMX bikes and stuff.

1041
01:19:33,811 --> 01:19:35,393

[SPEAKER_02]: Any interest in that mafia, the old country?

1075
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:46,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks a little weird.

1076
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:48,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't really played the mafia game.

1077
01:23:48,558 --> 01:23:52,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not into Grand Theft Auto period peace games.

1078
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what that is, right?

1079
01:23:55,128 --> 01:23:55,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1080
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I need modern Grand Theft Auto.

1081
01:23:57,652 --> 01:24:06,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like if somebody would take that idea and lean into it and take it one step forward to a comedy type of thing like a Grand Theft Auto, which I guess maybe is Red Dead Redemption.

1082
01:24:07,928 --> 01:24:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1083
01:24:08,369 --> 01:24:09,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1084
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:12,375
[SPEAKER_05]: They also have, was it, there was like, uh...

1085
01:24:12,929 --> 01:24:15,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Horse or something like that was one.

1086
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a GOG game.

1087
01:24:17,196 --> 01:24:18,437
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Grand Theft Amish?

1088
01:24:18,638 --> 01:24:19,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm looking for.

1089
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:20,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Amish?

1090
01:24:21,061 --> 01:24:21,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1091
01:24:21,903 --> 01:24:22,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like that.

1092
01:24:22,484 --> 01:24:23,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1093
01:24:23,044 --> 01:24:23,365
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1094
01:24:23,385 --> 01:24:23,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1095
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:28,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about games that are taking a long time to develop?

1096
01:24:28,112 --> 01:24:30,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And when our last story here before we get to the listener roundtable, Loki?

1097
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bioshock.

1098
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,146
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a series that we haven't seen anything from in a long time.

1099
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:41,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they are working on Bioshock 4.

1100
01:24:41,414 --> 01:25:07,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, apparently it's been restarted a few times with different game engines But yeah, 12 years since the last Bioshock game And apparently Bioshock 4 has been in development since even before that came out Yeah, I'm trying to remember what it said It's been like 15 years that they've been working on this essentially Because the development on this new game started before Infinite came out

1101
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:19,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, now, of course, though, because of that, they're saying that there's been some, you know, the Bioshock failed to review by executives the new game.

1102
01:25:20,153 --> 01:25:30,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also that there's been layoffs with the developers that have been working on it as well, so they can be more agile and efficient.

1103
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:34,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got to be agile when you're down people, I guess.

1104
01:25:34,773 --> 01:25:54,030
[SPEAKER_05]: that game has taken a long time to cook though it has taken a long time I kind of forgot that they're doing stuff there's other Ken Levine games though if I remember correctly there's that one that was in space when did that ever did that ever come out I don't think it did I honestly don't remember yeah so

1105
01:25:54,820 --> 01:26:23,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's go to the listener roundtable where you all can interact with our show every week You can send us emails over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com You can also send us messages on BlueSky You can follow us on BlueSky at orangeloungeradio.com We are verified by domain over on BlueSky I don't think we got anything this last week on BlueSky, no we didn't So, you know, maybe that's just a sign I need to post more, I don't know But yeah, check that out

1106
01:26:23,272 --> 01:26:25,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open up the mailbag here.

1107
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:29,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we had anything, Loki, but I'm just going to verify that.

1108
01:26:29,152 --> 01:26:32,182
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wouldn't mind, do you have any last-minute stories to throw at us while I pull up the mailbag?

1109
01:26:32,804 --> 01:26:34,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we're down a person tonight.

1110
01:26:35,084 --> 01:26:43,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I don't think we have any other last minute news, but certainly I'm curious to see.

1111
01:26:44,579 --> 01:26:47,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like should be not that far away from Gamescom.

1112
01:26:47,483 --> 01:26:49,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's like within a week or two.

1113
01:26:49,346 --> 01:26:50,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's real soon.

1114
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's right after.

1115
01:26:51,169 --> 01:26:53,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right after Evo, I think so.

1116
01:26:54,274 --> 01:26:57,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we should be seeing some more news coming out here pretty soon.

1117
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,903
[SPEAKER_02]: August 20th to 24th is Gamescom.

1118
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,986
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so a few more weeks, I guess.

1119
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:24,733
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah expecting to hear some more news regarding that stuff um be curious to see whether games are coming like honestly like uh I don't even know what the fourth quarter looks like right now I know that this year we've got was it Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty and you know some other mainline uh temple titles and stuff but I'd be curious to see how those all do

1120
01:27:24,983 --> 01:27:54,568
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing of Gamescom reminded me I have not yet plugged DragonCon yet on tonight's show I've been pretty good about pumping that up but just one more reminder I will be at DragonCon out in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend so DragonCon runs from officially it runs from August 28th Thursday through September 1st Monday but unofficially Wednesday's the new Thursday and some people stay around later too so I'm looking forward to being a part of the show again this year

1121
01:27:54,548 --> 01:28:13,245
[SPEAKER_02]: My lineup is still being finalized at the show, but the only thing that I know that is on lock is that Thursday night, and I think it was 7.30, but don't quote me on that time, we are going to be having a content creator mixer, and that is in the digital media room in the basement of the Hilton where the digital media events almost always are.

1122
01:28:13,305 --> 01:28:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Galleria 6.

1123
01:28:14,106 --> 01:28:15,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easy to find.

1124
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You just go to the bottom of the escalator and it's right there.

1125
01:28:17,308 --> 01:28:19,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be having a content... Thank you, Bobby.

1126
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:19,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 7 p.m.

1127
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:22,833
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be having the content creator mixer down there at 7.

1128
01:28:23,034 --> 01:28:24,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting it to be bigger this year.

1129
01:28:24,535 --> 01:28:40,570
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma

1130
01:28:40,550 --> 01:29:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: content creator mixer meet your next collaborator to try to like really entice because we want that's actually what we want it isn't to put ourselves out there I mean sure our business cards and flyers will be in the lobby but we want to invite people to come in meet people learn about platforms other than their own that's the thing I get out of it I love talking to YouTubers because I don't do enough on YouTube and I really love talking to TikTokers

1131
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,927
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've been consuming more TikTok, but I haven't been really creating a lot of it.

1132
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still kind of trying to find my rhythm with TikTok.

1133
01:29:13,612 --> 01:29:21,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'd be interested in mingling with people that work in different areas than necessarily Twitch.

1134
01:29:21,187 --> 01:29:24,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I'm opposed to meeting Twitch streamers too, but just to like hear about that stuff.

1135
01:29:24,894 --> 01:29:27,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, meet, connect, and network.

1136
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,743
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely it.

1137
01:29:29,808 --> 01:29:33,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwell says, I keep worrying that once I get good at TikTok, it'll be gone.

1138
01:29:34,252 --> 01:29:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: The skills are adaptable to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, which honestly, any content you make for TikTok ought to go on those two platforms as well before somebody copy pastes it over there if you ever get something viral.

1139
01:29:47,665 --> 01:29:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think part of the trick with the short videos is you have to take a multi-platform approach almost.

1140
01:29:54,992 --> 01:29:55,613
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1141
01:29:55,897 --> 01:29:57,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1142
01:29:57,340 --> 01:29:57,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1143
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's something we're going to talk about on some of the panels this year over at DragonCon.

1144
01:30:01,148 --> 01:30:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So really excited about that.

1145
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:05,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I can confirm I am involved with main programming.

1146
01:30:05,857 --> 01:30:07,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot confirm what that's going to mean yet.

1147
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:11,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't know until the app releases.

1148
01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:13,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is maybe that.

1149
01:30:13,733 --> 01:30:35,775
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1150
01:30:36,447 --> 01:30:40,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of different modalities, Loki would love more YouTube viewers.

1151
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:40,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep that up.

1152
01:30:40,997 --> 01:30:43,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, always.

1153
01:30:43,021 --> 01:30:43,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Over at LokiOLR.

1154
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't do the TikTok thing, right?

1155
01:30:49,154 --> 01:30:51,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, I've tried a few and they just don't take off.

1156
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:54,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to still figure out the right way to do it.

1157
01:30:54,952 --> 01:31:01,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But then short form, I've done long form because I was like, oh, you know, some of these, they like long.

1158
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: For them, it's almost like long form is kind of like YouTube shorts in the sense that it's like different, but you could put stuff over there.

1159
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:11,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, nothing to get confused, so...

1160
01:31:11,918 --> 01:31:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I have been consuming more TikTok lately and I bet I'll name a couple creators that I bet some of you in chat will pick up on and it does relate to some of the stories we talked about tonight since we don't have a lot of other comments I'll just kind of go on this tangent is that that Switch story about the inflated Switch prices Aaron Parnas actually did a

1161
01:31:31,595 --> 01:31:34,898
[SPEAKER_02]: TikTok on that, which is the breaking news guy, right?

1162
01:31:35,238 --> 01:31:40,683
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're ever scrolling through TikTok for you, Paige, and you ever get that young kid that's always like, we got some breaking news here out of Washington.

1163
01:31:41,884 --> 01:31:44,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So that crossed his feed.

1164
01:31:45,387 --> 01:31:54,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of shows, because I think it's one of the first major companies that has announced that they're doing tariffs or what the impact is actually going to be.

1165
01:31:55,617 --> 01:31:59,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So Rimari says, I don't like TikTok because it's such a noisy app.

1166
01:31:59,340 --> 01:31:59,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that.

1167
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:01,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, I get that.

1168
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not sure I can sit here and say there's an easy alternative in YouTube or no, they're all just as noisy.

1169
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:11,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

1170
01:32:11,395 --> 01:32:15,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you get something that might be a little more calm?

1171
01:32:16,983 --> 01:32:22,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that like I know people that love to watch ASMR videos, but I feel like you've said you're not a fan of those either.

1172
01:32:22,951 --> 01:32:23,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong.

1173
01:32:24,213 --> 01:32:28,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, sometimes I will also open TikTok

1174
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll open up TikTok and it will be this beautiful ocean view with the beach and it'll have this really uplifting sound that's playing like a happy little Enya song.

1175
01:32:41,191 --> 01:32:42,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Sail away, sail away.

1176
01:32:42,973 --> 01:32:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And the little caption on it says this and waking up to the headline that he died.

1177
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,361
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't say who.

1178
01:32:51,622 --> 01:32:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You all know who.

1179
01:32:53,544 --> 01:32:54,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to be clear.

1180
01:32:55,902 --> 01:32:57,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not saying who.

1181
01:32:57,349 --> 01:32:59,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can neither confirm nor deny who.

1182
01:32:59,761 --> 01:33:02,655
[SPEAKER_02]: But your instinct is probably correct.

1183
01:33:03,935 --> 01:33:05,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is a thing.

1184
01:33:05,999 --> 01:33:13,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you allow the TikTok algorithm to sort of fall down that rabbit hole, you can get those uplifting sort of messages.

1185
01:33:13,813 --> 01:33:14,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard thing to do, though.

1186
01:33:14,895 --> 01:33:16,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1187
01:33:16,918 --> 01:33:18,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Aaron Parnas covered the Switch thing.

1188
01:33:18,982 --> 01:33:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I thought was interesting, this is an interesting creator.

1189
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:23,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think their name is SilentMiddleChild.

1190
01:33:23,991 --> 01:33:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if any of you have ever seen this creator because they seem to get a lot of views.

1191
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:34,734
[SPEAKER_02]: and there'll be a girl in the background that you never see that'll be like, hey, Anthony, tell me about this particular type.

1192
01:33:34,854 --> 01:33:38,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this guy that's very, he sits there and he's playing video games.

1193
01:33:38,182 --> 01:33:40,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it looks like he's playing Fortnite.

1194
01:33:40,186 --> 01:33:44,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And while he's playing Fortnite, he just effortlessly explains

1195
01:33:44,857 --> 01:34:02,393
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1196
01:34:02,373 --> 01:34:23,183
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1197
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,486
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big enough headline.

1198
01:34:25,706 --> 01:34:31,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It's showing up on the massive TikTok creator accounts and becoming content for them to explain as well.

1199
01:34:32,254 --> 01:34:35,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was really interesting.

1200
01:34:35,377 --> 01:34:38,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I actually think that's like legit.

1201
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:40,523
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy does a very good job explaining things.

1202
01:34:40,543 --> 01:34:43,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost, and SSJ100Matt says, I still never download TikTok.

1203
01:34:43,367 --> 01:34:44,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I just scroll reels on Insta.

1204
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:50,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee both of these creators have shown up on Insta and YouTube, whether it's official or not.

1205
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:56,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you don't copy your content and put it over there, somebody else will.

1206
01:34:56,856 --> 01:35:03,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I would assume you've seen that guy on some platform at some point.

1207
01:35:03,706 --> 01:35:07,952
[SPEAKER_02]: If you consume that stuff at all, if you don't spend enough time consuming that crap, then maybe you haven't.

1208
01:35:09,034 --> 01:35:13,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, I guess that's it.

1209
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:14,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have a lot else to say.

1210
01:35:14,221 --> 01:35:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've gone on a tangent enough and we don't have any last minute stories.

1211
01:35:17,146 --> 01:35:18,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means we wrap it up.

1212
01:35:18,508 --> 01:35:18,888
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

1213
01:35:19,629 --> 01:35:20,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the hell out.

1214
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:24,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well then, let's get final thoughts.

1215
01:35:24,155 --> 01:35:26,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I'm going to say thank you as always for downloading our show.

1216
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.

1217
01:35:30,023 --> 01:35:34,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a friend or two, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1218
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:42,199
[SPEAKER_02]: A site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, a nice five-star review, a comment, a like, all that stuff goes an awful long way.

1219
01:35:42,219 --> 01:35:45,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you get sick of hearing creators say it, but they say it for a reason.

1220
01:35:45,624 --> 01:35:46,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does help.

1221
01:35:46,665 --> 01:35:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't ask for your money here.

1222
01:35:48,027 --> 01:35:52,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But a like can do more than throwing us, you know, a dollar, to be honest.

1223
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So please do that.

1224
01:35:54,837 --> 01:35:57,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I do see Dark Tetsuya has now shouted it out twice in chat.

1225
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:09,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And I meant to say something, sorry, saying I have to shout out Earthion that just dropped on Steam, Yuzo Koshiro, and Ancient's new Genesis shmup also drops on consoles next month.

1226
01:36:09,037 --> 01:36:09,999
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, DarkSakura.

1227
01:36:10,019 --> 01:36:11,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I meant to give you a plug a minute ago.

1228
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:14,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check that out as well.

1229
01:36:14,467 --> 01:36:14,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1230
01:36:15,048 --> 01:36:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, spread the word.

1231
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:17,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1232
01:36:17,733 --> 01:36:18,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more voices to put out on air.

1233
01:36:19,256 --> 01:36:19,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I said it all.

1234
01:36:20,258 --> 01:36:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So final thoughts then.

1235
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,604
[SPEAKER_02]: No Jamie tonight, but she'll be back next week.

1236
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:27,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That means no Jamie streaming after the show tonight, but I believe somebody else is going to.

1237
01:36:27,491 --> 01:36:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So stick with us for those of you that are listening live.

1238
01:36:30,596 --> 01:36:32,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we'll go to you for your final thought.

1239
01:36:33,117 --> 01:36:36,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, I'm still hoping that I get my data pack done.

1240
01:36:36,983 --> 01:36:40,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping to have it done last week, but I don't know.

1241
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:41,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Progress is being made.

1242
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:43,293
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just taking forever.

1243
01:36:43,873 --> 01:36:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you got this.

1244
01:36:46,477 --> 01:36:55,311
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought tonight is I hate technical glitches, but I love Final Fantasy XI, and I love other games too, and I'm going to play more of them this week.

1245
01:36:55,291 --> 01:36:57,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's it.

1246
01:36:57,313 --> 01:36:57,814
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of here.

1247
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great night everybody.

1248
01:36:58,735 --> 01:36:59,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for watching.

1249
01:36:59,776 --> 01:37:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1250
01:37:01,879 --> 01:37:03,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back next week.

1251
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Jamie will be with us and thank you all for your participation tonight whether online with us here in chat as we're live or on the podcast feed.

1252
01:37:13,151 --> 01:37:13,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you.

1253
01:37:13,812 --> 01:37:13,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1254
01:37:16,095 --> 01:37:18,538
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
