9633	14497	Now that legendary games are getting good movies and TV shows, it's weird to realize how many of those games I haven't played.
14517	22865	Fallout, The Witcher, most of the Castlevanias, and now Far Cry, which is in production apparently, but given many factors, it's a good idea to wait for a series release date before too much hype.
22965	25527	I started Far Cry two or three times, but never really made progress.
25667	29150	I want to for the narrative, but I'm only one trophy away from getting Platinum and Death Stranding 2.
29251	30452	It's time to get the band back together.
30612	35296	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about these stories and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35316	37598	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.
39265	41850	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41870	46518	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46538	50445	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight.
51006	57257	Episode number 1058 of our show for tonight, August 10th of 2025.
57237	58499	My name is Rob Roberts.
58519	63364	I'm here to talk about video games, very serious stuff, and never any tangents.
63525	64085	Never, never.
64486	68791	With all of you live in our chat as we are taping live at the Voice Geeks Network.
68811	72496	But I'm also joined by my co-host, of course, starting off with the one and only Jamie Summers.
72616	73016	Hi, Jamie.
74558	74999	Hi.
75019	76541	I still go by DarkSakura, you know.
76821	77281	That's true.
77482	80245	And I should say welcome back as well.
80265	81206	Thank you.
81767	82568	Hi.
82588	82688	Yeah.
83866	105621	brain suck sometimes uh you had a little marathon yesterday i was i was i was there for like the beginning and then i just left my computer on while i went and did other stuff yesterday but you went for a very long time i did and you know i i saw a few olr people there um not not not a lot
106006	124926	but I did a lot of Dead by Daylight and I did some Mass Effect 2 as sort of a palate cleanser but there were some very generous people who basically paid for my hotel room at Disneyland that's good
125935	134310	I'm trying to make sure that I've got enough money to cover TwitchCon and still be able to pay the bills.
136714	142564	And do some tech repairs in the local studio.
142965	144107	Because it's practical.
144788	146391	I'm doing practical stuff.
146371	172092	I wish I could go to TwitchCon but at this point I have a conflict that weekend now so I can't go even if I made it work out last minute but I kept telling Alan he could go but yeah I'm out unfortunately so but I'm sure it'll be a good time well my friend who we've probably seen in my chat is Mabel Von Smallcat is coming with me we have a cute little Airbnb oh fun
172814	200442	and then we're going to Disneyland together that'll be fun and then it's gonna be pretty busy I'm going to probably be like flat on my face afterwards but I'm looking forward to it I've already started working on my cosplays and yeah well cosplay is singular since it's always the pig excited to see the latest evolution of your pig cosplay
200877	203972	Let's also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
204033	204455	Hi, Loki.
205399	205620	Hello.
206083	207671	And I know you're not going to TwitchCon either.
207791	208575	That's sad.
208808	234495	I'll tell you what, Loki, I'm skipping the party.
234535	236217	It's the same thing as last year.
236483	238166	Yeah, the party sucked.
238186	239788	Save yourself $100.
239808	241691	It's just not worth it.
243053	244114	The food was okay.
245977	250144	It's not the same without a Kim Petras concert and whoever else they had that one year.
250324	251125	Although I didn't go.
251205	252547	I just heard it from the parking lot.
253108	264465	You know, last year was great when you had people that couldn't sing screaming at one stage and then you had a DJ just two blocks down the other way playing loud music and then the music was just...
264817	267343	grading against each other in the middle.
267363	268245	So that's fun.
268907	269769	Yeah, love that.
270631	273778	S0100, Matt, in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
273798	281256	Because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
281236	283179	Terrible.
283199	299785	Terrible.
299765	302231	During the convention, it wasn't coming back to Vegas.
302652	313197	And it was just it would have been a lot better if it was at one of the hotel convention centers, which I've been to a Final Fantasy 14 event at the Rio.
313258	317588	And I think there's a big Star Trek convention at the Rio this weekend, actually, because I have a lot of friends there for my cruise.
317568	318750	are there.
318770	321093	And the Paris, I know one year had it.
321213	331708	These places are fine, but yeah, TwitchCon was at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which just was really hard to get to, especially with a giant fucking concert going on that same weekend.
331768	332249	It was just bad.
332269	335233	And then F1 Formula Racing, it was terrible to get around Vegas.
335614	338678	So I'm not going to miss TwitchCon Vegas at all.
338939	342664	I think San Diego is a much better city for it, except the one...
342644	359674	It's hard to, like, um...
359654	364006	It's also hard to find lodging in that area too.
364026	374135	If you're willing to go further away and Uber in or whatever, then you might get lucky with Pacific Beach or something like that.
374415	374676	They do.
374656	378241	Yeah, well, that works.
378381	401794	Yeah.
401977	406027	Honestly, probably cheaper than getting a hotel down in the grid somewhere.
406087	407470	And how often are you staying in your hotel room?
407490	407992	It really was.
408012	410397	I do not.
410418	411079	I had internet.
411119	412382	I was happy.
412402	417214	Speaking of conventions over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Rin Mari in chat says, Anyway, hi.
417334	418838	I went to MAGFest this weekend.
418818	424564	I got a ribbon for playing a rhythm game, meme song in 15 games, and no, it's not flower.
425004	427367	Well, I'm glad you had fun at MAG West.
427387	432692	That's one of those conventions I always mean to get to, but it's just like such a busy time of year for me.
433133	434454	But yeah, I've always been curious about that.
434474	436777	So I'm glad you had a good time there.
437197	440861	And I have a couple other friends that go, and yeah, I need to get out there one year.
440881	446867	Because I had a lot of fun at MAG Fest the couple times that I went, and I'd love to go again, but again...
446847	448810	since they don't do it in February.
448830	452938	The times they did it in February were a fluke and that made it much easier to get to.
453699	460792	Now that it's like early January, it's harder for me to go cross-country to a thing like MAGFest as much as I'd love to go.
460812	461974	But, you know, never say never.
462495	463877	But I will say...
463857	488802	DragonCon, DragonCon, DragonCon
489457	503777	When I do have my final schedule, I'm not going to have time to meet people with these... Unfortunately, the types of panels these are, I'm not going to be able to meet and greet people from the show then.
503837	516375	So it's really best if you want to say hi, and I'm certainly happy to say hi, give you a little FaceTime, see how you're doing, whatever, unless you try to find me impromptu during the convention, which it does...
516355	537132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
537112	558867	Animes down there, BritTracks, we're right next door to BritTracks so there's a lot of tracks down there so in Galleria 6 we're going to be having a big meet and greet for content creators you do not have to be a content creator to be there you can just be an aspiring content creator or somebody that supports content creators and wants to find new ones that is A-OK so I encourage you to come down there and it's on a Thursday
558847	574813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
574793	582063	And I can tell you what one of her cosplays is because she's posted about it on her TikTok and her Instagram.
582083	583085	So I know it's not a secret.
583545	592297	She is dressing as Parker Posey's character from Josie and the Pussycats in the scene with the Mega Records dress, which took her four.
592538	596423	She had to make 400 vinyl stickers that say Mega Records on them to make this dress.
597084	597865	It's incredible.
597845	617743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
617723	643360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
644285	645988	Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
646509	661332	Certainly not, you know, 13 hours.
661312	687015	and we actually have something about music games to start us off tonight how lovely because I'm sure y'all know by now but if you don't Orange Lounge Radio started because we all met playing DDR and that's pretty much exclusively what we used to talk about was music based games whether it was Konami's Bimani series or other you know adjacent games in that space but interesting blast from the past potentially coming back yeah Loki?
687991	696820	Yes, it was many, many years ago that we met up with the people from Red Octane to actually play... We were just talking about that like two weeks ago.
697373	721812	We were just talking about that.
722652	724734	Starting back up where they left off, I guess.
726376	728118	Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see.
728219	739932	So this is I don't remember if it's the same folks behind it, but it basically Charles and Kai Huang, who were formerly part of Harmonix Music System.
739972	742455	Those names do sound familiar, like super familiar.
742695	749183	I can't claim I know everybody there, but like those names, I was like, I feel like those were some of the minds back in the day that were running Red Octane.
749585	775980	DJ Hero, please.
776298	806254	I'd love that.
807027	807769	Yeah.
807889	825205	Yeah.
825185	846552	and DarkSakura.com.
846532	857391	It's just that it's different when you can have these songs that people instantly recognize from Journey or whatever bands that people turns their heads and makes them want to see, well, what's this going on?
857932	862740	And that's why Guitar Hero did as well as it did, especially versus something like Guitar Freaks.
862760	867088	You want to take a step back once upon a time.
867068	870613	Konami also was extremely risk adverse in America.
870853	872896	Extremely risk adverse.
872916	879205	They did not want to put out DDR in the US and they quite frankly resisted it for an awful long time.
879665	888397	And I don't know if that was the music licensing or trying to do the peripheral and their data told them that a peripheral wouldn't work well here in the US or whatever.
888798	891441	But they were quite frankly resistant to it for a very long time.
891802	895607	And so that's why DDR did pretty good for them because they had a
895587	916718	Carameldansen
916698	917941	Just shit the bed.
918141	919705	They gave the Rock Revolution.
919725	922230	It's like, what the hell were you thinking?
922431	928724	That was the beginning of a really dark era for Konami.
928744	933555	And to be fair, Konami, I think we would all agree, especially post-pandemic.
933575	934116	They turned it around.
934096	936579	Seems to be in a much better place than they were.
936619	939622	They have other people to run their license.
939942	943726	Suikoden recently came back, and the HD remaster was pretty good.
944107	949312	Silent Hill, the 2 remake, a lot better than people were expecting, that's for sure.
949392	952295	Now, I know people are still on the fence about this new one, but we'll see.
952455	954958	It does seem like Konami is in a better place.
955018	957180	But also, this isn't about Konami.
957541	959563	They don't have the exclusive...
959543	960665	you know, on this.
960705	967337	And they will have nothing to do with this game besides maybe some type of fee that has to be paid for trade.
967358	968039	I don't know.
968059	969501	I don't know how all that legal stuff works.
969522	974170	But, you know, Konami otherwise has very little to do with this.
974190	975713	So...
976368	977389	Let's see.
977629	982033	Ranmari in chat says, American rhythm games don't appeal to me for a lot of the reasons they succeed.
982433	989300	Long songs, songs just not my taste, super modes for scoring, so I just accept that I'll be a socially unacceptable rhythm gamer.
989660	989940	I don't know.
989980	992042	I always had room in my heart for both.
992402	1000310	I always felt I was discovering more music in the Japanese games, but I could get my... Fuck.
1000330	1001531	I just spilled a soda, guys.
1001871	1002772	I gotta go AFK.
1003292	1003813	Somebody take over.
1004273	1006375	You could get your fuck.
1006355	1009958	No, I will put it this way.
1011780	1013742	What other people like isn't any of my business.
1014182	1015283	I'm glad if they like it.
1015444	1016284	I'm glad if they don't.
1017305	1021229	I enjoy what I enjoy, and what other people do or don't enjoy doesn't affect what I enjoy.
1022430	1024913	That being said, give me more rhythm games.
1024933	1030298	Expand it, make more space for it, and we will start to see more of the niche stuff, I hope.
1031339	1032820	At least that's my theory.
1033341	1033881	I don't know.
1034637	1042286	Yeah, so it's going to be interesting to see what they actually come out with with this, since they said that they're going to be announcing their first rhythm game later this year.
1043607	1045430	They have a rather large team.
1045450	1050375	This is still within free mode of Embracer Group, so they're a subsidiary of Embracer.
1050696	1060527	Hopefully it doesn't mean that they're going to get sold off mid-development, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see what happens with this, because certainly there's been a
1060945	1062928	Quite the break in rhythm games.
1063008	1072040	I know that they've kind of brought some of that back a little bit with the Fortnite Music Fest stuff, but it would be interesting to see kind of a resurgence.
1072121	1084658	And if something like say that they put out that's similar to like a Guitar Hero, but maybe not quite, you know, takes off, maybe Activision, Microsoft revisits Guitar Hero.
1086325	1087046	It's always possible.
1087066	1094840	Although they tried to do that and it didn't work out, but you know, I mean, it'd be interesting to see something come of this, you know.
1096463	1108384	Yeah, I mean, in the end, I mean, we don't really know everything about it that there is to know, so I want to see what happens.
1109512	1137645	I was looking to see if the guy that came to your house at one time that was Simon Tam and no, he's not listed as one of the employees here so he has moved on he was a producer at Red Octane but yeah, it'd be interesting to see what they have in mind for the rhythm game he was pretty cool though he was a nice guy he was nice very enthusiastic about it too
1138908	1165489	certainly and it it's funny and I think he was a little amused at the Bimani stuff because I actually looked back in the video and one of my Bimani things was actually still in the corner yeah and it's also funny too because like uh I think Red Octane's almost their rebirth of this I want to say that they were making even peripherals for the Fortnite stuff as well I think they were doing that either that or it was um
1166212	1187613	I don't think Harmonix was putting out anything, but somebody was making guitars for the Fortnite Music Fest stuff, so I'm wondering if that's still Red Octane, and if that's the case, it's like restarting the company the same way it started previously, which is kind of funny.
1187633	1187713	Hmm.
1187845	1188526	All right, I'm back.
1188626	1189207	Sorry, everybody.
1189327	1191010	The joys of doing live radio.
1191090	1193514	I spilled a soda and it got all over.
1193614	1195337	I had to change my shorts.
1195357	1196058	I'm so annoyed.
1196078	1199464	And now the chair is sticky, even though I toweled it off.
1199524	1200345	I'm annoyed.
1200365	1202469	And the chat, I see everybody in chat.
1202529	1203190	Thank you.
1203250	1205554	I see bits and subs to help pay for clean.
1205574	1206255	Thank you, everybody.
1206275	1207858	You guys are really funny.
1207878	1209500	Somebody was asking if it was orange soda.
1209661	1211203	Ironically...
1211183	1233225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1233205	1235948	Alan, when bringing these in the house, dropped them.
1236008	1238831	You can see the lid is a little funky because these got dropped.
1238911	1241213	It was like a thing from Costco and it got dropped on the ground.
1241554	1243456	And so I guess when I went to drink it, I don't know.
1243596	1246059	I just, I forgot how to drink.
1246079	1251304	So down to the ground it went and now my legs are sticky.
1251324	1253446	So I'll be taking a shower after the show.
1253927	1255489	That is annoying.
1255509	1256850	Anyway.
1257185	1258348	The joys of live radio.
1258409	1266853	Okay, sorry to distract from the topic of Red Octane Games, but until they actually announce what they're working on, I guess we don't have a whole lot left to say, do we?
1267715	1268036	Nope.
1268056	1269320	No, I mean, that was my point.
1269481	1272409	We don't really know, so we're not going to know until they...
1273385	1300354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1301313	1320132	Vecna Adept Vecna
1321563	1324387	I played Mass Effect 2.
1324507	1325709	I've played Palia.
1325729	1334541	I actually started playing a little bit more of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora because with the next movie coming out, I've been kind of getting back into it.
1336164	1338227	And I actually really enjoyed the story.
1339789	1344936	And I didn't play much through the second DLC, so I figured I'd give it another go.
1345016	1346538	And so far, I'm really enjoying it.
1346558	1351165	The game is gorgeous.
1351668	1357536	That, that was, I mean, other than like my little phone dealy bobs, that's about it.
1357556	1358357	That's about it.
1359438	1360079	Okay.
1360099	1360740	We'll go to Loki.
1360760	1361681	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1362642	1364885	I mean, it was basically Minecraft.
1364985	1370532	I didn't really get to play much of Minecraft because I was busy still coding the data pack.
1371213	1378823	Actually, multiple data packs because I rebuilt one that we were using this week as well, but just still working on coding the data pack.
1379056	1382441	for our PvE arena that we're going to have.
1382961	1384684	So still working on that.
1384764	1386266	But yeah, we got that.
1386386	1390091	And then I got my MCC TCG cards.
1390171	1392955	I still have to crack open on a stream or something.
1392975	1396780	So that's kind of fun having some of the Minecraft event cards and stuff.
1396980	1398162	And then...
1399913	1402816	Yeah, I picked up a few more games that I don't know what I'm going to play.
1403417	1406341	The one behind me, of course, is called The RPG.
1406441	1412108	It's kind of like a spoof of Skyrim, stuff like that.
1412228	1420257	So you can side with the king or you can side with the monsters and actually try to take over the kingdom and stuff.
1420357	1424903	It's got a funny art style that kind of reminds me of Job Simulator or something like that.
1425383	1426925	So I thought it looked kind of cool.
1427246	1428387	Yeah, I forgot to ask what that game was.
1428427	1429228	It looks really cute.
1430120	1434167	No, I wasn't.
1434427	1452398	I had a headache.
1452378	1455864	I fell back down the Final Fantasy XI rabbit hole hard last week.
1456746	1463337	So thanks to Retro Achievements, I learned about this private Final Fantasy XI thing called Horizon.
1464218	1470509	And I don't feel bad playing on a private server because I still pay Square Enix every month and I bought Final Fantasy XI twice.
1470529	1471551	So talk to the wall.
1471531	1487295	All of that stuff.
1487275	1488657	So it doesn't even have Otter gone.
1488678	1493186	He can't even be a Blue Mage or a Corsair or whatever else they added in that one.
1493226	1497593	You're only limited to the first couple expansions and level 75.
1498134	1502382	But the interesting thing is the client still has some...
1502362	1504905	of the modern quality of life things, but not a lot.
1504925	1507469	It does level sync, which is huge for the game.
1507789	1513296	It does have level sync, but that's the only thing as opposed to, you know, like there's no book burning.
1513597	1515800	You still have to do dunes parties and things like that.
1516220	1521747	So, but it's like, I feel like this, it's scratching a nostalgia bone for me hard.
1522268	1526994	Like, you know, y'all know how long, how much we used to play fucking Final Fantasy XI back in the day.
1527535	1531440	But like already in the scope of what, a week and a half that I've been playing this,
1531893	1538583	I'm a level 22 Red Mage with a level 10... I need to work on a level 10 White Mage subjob.
1538863	1539965	So I finished the subjob class.
1540286	1545794	I did the run to Juno this morning and got my Chocobo because that's another thing they sped up.
1545814	1546675	You don't have to wait.
1547096	1548578	You used to have to do the Chocobo quest.
1548598	1551783	It would take you like six hours because you had to wait an in-game day.
1551803	1555248	They compressed it so that every in-game hour you can feed the Chocobo.
1555268	1556229	So it goes by a lot faster.
1556249	1557732	You can get it done in 30 minutes.
1557752	1558693	So...
1558673	1561637	Yeah, exactly.
1561797	1564020	So anyway, it's been interesting.
1564040	1570570	And yeah, I was able to get to Juno and talk to the thing that unlocks more of my retro achievements for leveling and stuff.
1570590	1573974	So I can actually see the little progress I'm making.
1574135	1581765	Not that I'm doing it for achievements, because now it's just like scratching this nostalgia bone where I'm like, God, playing in parties was actually really fun.
1581805	1583027	Like I just...
1583007	1586431	The modern MMOs don't have the same feel to it.
1586632	1589956	It's slower, but that was part of the charm of it.
1590196	1593540	Doing things like magic bursts and skill chains and all that shit.
1593560	1596624	And Horizon, for the most part, embraces add-ons.
1596644	1603272	There's some that are on their ban list, but their client has a bunch pre-installed if you want to use them.
1603292	1606296	And some of them will tell you what skill chains to do.
1606316	1606997	It's nice.
1607117	1608559	You don't have to memorize everything.
1608539	1613304	So, um, I think for all those reasons, it's moving a little faster than it did when I first played the game.
1614125	1615706	Uh, but yeah, just enjoying it.
1615726	1623274	But I am recognizing like, wow, I'm like playing nothing else because I'm too much in this nostalgia hole right now.
1623874	1627938	But sometimes, sometimes you just want to eat comfort food.
1627958	1632162	You know, you're going to eat pizza and ice cream every day for a week until you get sick of it.
1632723	1636086	And then you go, oh, I should stop eating this.
1636607	1636707	Yeah.
1637311	1640541	Loki, I'm surprised you haven't tried and fallen down that hole yet.
1640581	1641283	I'm really surprised.
1641344	1642547	I know what you would do.
1642608	1643651	That's why I haven't tried.
1643671	1645597	You have 11 more than anyone, so all right.
1645617	1647784	I downloaded 11 again the other day.
1648446	1648586	Yeah.
1649128	1650392	So I just have...
1650575	1678354	I don't know what you'd have to do differently because I bought it a long time ago back on like was it the Amazon game store or something like that so I still have like an installation like a key that's still valid Horizon's a whole separate thing and it doesn't use play online so they have a whole separate installer and the game client is so it's an all-in-one pack you don't have to do anything special you just download it and there it is so yeah it's kind of nice so but again I probably shouldn't be enabling you
1678334	1681639	So, um, but that is my gaming week.
1681659	1683803	I should get back to, I still want to beat fantasy life.
1683863	1694821	I still have games on the switch to play, but you know, you know, some, sometimes after a long day at work, you just want to join a Valcrum Dunes party and skill chain lizards for three hours.
1694841	1695622	What, just what you want to do.
1696624	1697004	All right.
1697124	1698026	You know what I want to do?
1698166	1698807	What's that?
1699495	1700677	Farm, and Pallia.
1701618	1704844	Yeah, and that's kind of a comfort food sort of game, too.
1705024	1706547	And I get that, because I play Pallia now.
1706567	1707488	Yeah, it's my cozy vibe.
1707688	1708830	Yeah, it's cozy vibe.
1710393	1717985	Alright, the only thing that's not cozy vibe about Final Fantasy XI, running away from goblin tinkers that you accidentally aggroed, because that's also still a thing.
1718005	1719347	You still gotta zone the goblins.
1720049	1720930	But...
1720910	1727839	They don't do that because in the old XI, they used to run back and they would attack all the other parties as they're running back.
1728119	1730382	But now once they get zoned, they fade.
1730402	1731844	They fade away and they don't run back.
1732164	1733827	So that's kind of nice.
1733907	1736770	Yeah, you can't grief parties or anything like that.
1736850	1737852	They changed that.
1738973	1741657	That was not long into the game that they changed that.
1741677	1744981	I want to say they changed that with the Treasures of Ottergon expansion or something.
1745822	1745922	Yeah.
1745902	1749653	Okay, let's talk about more going on in gaming news.
1749874	1755490	Speaking of Nintendo, a lot out of their camp this week yet again going into the holidays, right, Loki?
1756094	1759380	Yeah, they did their Nintendo Indie World Showcase.
1759400	1765290	So they're announcing a bunch of different indie games that are coming out on the different Switch platforms and stuff.
1765630	1767053	Some of these we've heard of before.
1767153	1768275	Some of these were new.
1769557	1772121	So kind of just we'll go over these really quickly.
1773904	1775807	Some of the stuff that's a little more familiar.
1775848	1780836	So we had Mina the Hollow Word, which of course is from the Shovel Knight folks.
1781103	1803313	and they showed off a new uh gameplay trailer and also that now so that demo is available for that uh there's uh Well Dweller which looks pretty cool it's kind of a dark fantasy metroidvania game that's coming out next year uh Neverway which is like a it almost reminds me of a um
1804306	1806049	Don't Starve type game.
1806129	1809655	It's basically a nightmarish life sim or something like that.
1810878	1811699	Kind of interesting.
1812701	1815005	And that's supposed to be coming out next year as well.
1815526	1818491	Hurtling, I think I've seen a trailer for this before.
1819172	1827006	The folks behind Firewatch, that's coming out in about a week or two on the 21st.
1827239	1850428	is this seat taken that's a cool puzzle game that was released that day they announced a new update for big kitty uh little kitty big city and they're going to be getting this uh a perfect picture update that's also going to have new areas new friends that you can meet new skills and uh of course a camera mode because
1850408	1874560	why the game didn't have a photo mode with cats that's what we use the internet for anyways um so yeah and that's coming out later this year that free content update uh speaking of content content warning is going to be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 as well sometime next year um Ball X Pit or Ball Pit from Devolver Digital looked pretty awesome it's kind of like a
1874540	1878819	Roguelike with Arkanoid style gameplay.
1879121	1881833	So you can now pay to spend extra time in the ball pit.
1882724	1883686	Yes, you can.
1883706	1884086	Hooray.
1884888	1889917	And that's launching on the Switch October 15th and on the Switch 2 sometime later.
1890618	1894966	Then we have Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, which is the sequel to Ultimate Chicken Horse.
1894986	1899534	It's like a racing platformer game instead of the traditional one.
1899935	1904022	And that's going to be coming out a little bit later this year, I think.
1905325	1906707	Glaciered
1906687	1914479	is a, it almost looks like a Subnautica type thing, but it's a RPG with aquatic monsters.
1915060	1918325	And that's going to be coming out this holiday on Switch 2.
1918346	1922652	And then they showed off just some quick trailers as well.
1923293	1932508	So we had a trailer for Winter Burrow, which is a kind of a cool looking survival game where you play a mouse living in the snow.
1932488	1933751	So that was kind of neat.
1934051	1944132	We had Undusted Letters from the Past, Tiny Bookshop, Caves of... I have no idea how to pronounce that.
1944332	1944693	Cud?
1945274	1945455	What?
1946216	1947038	Q-U-D?
1947423	1947864	Coode?
1948625	1949125	Who knows?
1950067	1953772	Strange Antiquities, Opus, Prism Peak, Go!
1953792	1954013	Go!
1954033	1956356	Town, UFO 50, which is awesome.
1956496	1959761	That actually was launching that day as well.
1959961	1961223	UFO 50 is a great game.
1961884	1965069	And then, of course, Demon's School and Go!
1965089	1965229	Go!
1965269	1966090	Town.
1966762	1969746	But yeah, lots of indie games we're checking out.
1969947	1979040	Nice to see Nintendo sort of dedicate a little time because I think sometimes, at least with the original Switch shop, it really felt overloaded and burdened.
1979060	1981443	I mean, I guess this is true to some extent with the Switch 2 shop too.
1982765	1984467	We know there's a bunch of shovelware on there.
1984487	1985048	We know where there is.
1985469	1991858	So it's nice of Nintendo to spend some of their official time really highlighting some things that are kind of worth a second look that can get lost.
1991838	1996745	I kind of wish they did these maybe once a month and a little more often.
1997065	1999869	Although I guess maybe they seem to do them about once every other month.
1999909	2001692	So maybe it's not as bad as I'm thinking in my mind.
2002052	2006078	So it's nice that they highlight those types of things because it's, you know, it's good.
2006879	2012327	Going to some comments over in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network about some of the games in the pack.
2012307	2040981	DarkTetsuya says I admit most of these aren't really in my wheelhouse but I did notice UFO 50 so hope to pick that one up at some point Bobby Blackwolf also commenting on UFO 50 saying UFO 50 was the best announcement of the day and it was buried in a sizzle reel well that happens sometimes you know what what might not be a big deal to you is a big deal to someone else and then of course the whole infamous they spend too much time talking about this sports game I don't give a fuck about like that happens a lot too right so
2040961	2041922	Yeah, not in this thing.
2042903	2044305	Well, not in the indie thing.
2044705	2047809	Although, indie sports games tend to be the best ones.
2047829	2056318	Actually, I will say, one of our local little bars did their gamer night this week, and some of my friends were playing Windjammer for like an hour.
2056939	2061443	So, you know, although, is that really an indie?
2061464	2062224	I kind of think it is.
2063886	2067390	Let's see, another comment here from Seeger Starzik, who says...
2067370	2094508	is this seat taken is pretty good picked it up that day and have had a really good time with it so far seems like it could be very short though yeah sometimes those indie games especially if they're low cost may be kind of cheaper so there's that all right well uh hopefully y'all saw at least one thing in that showcase that you liked uh meanwhile a lot of people telling Nintendo what they like or don't like about a certain system that they have set up with their
2096108	2118285	Digital Game Keycards
2118265	2122631	So, yeah, I'm going to assume that people really jumped on this.
2122651	2138034	And honestly, because the whole game key card thing has garnered a lot of negative attention, like at least, you know, if the temperature on social media, on places like Blue Sky, Facebook, whatever TikToks to be believed, people don't really like this.
2138615	2144644	So I'm sure there were plenty of people that were jumping at the opportunity to give some feedback on this.
2144624	2172184	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2172164	2181262	Some of the questions that they were asking were, in general, when it comes to games for a Nintendo Switch system, do you prefer purchasing games in physical format or in digital formats?
2181984	2188958	And for which of the following reasons would you consider purchasing physical versions of Nintendo Switch games?
2189478	2191421	Because you never fucking discount them?
2191441	2192803	Is that a valid response?
2193404	2195167	It seems like that actually is.
2195707	2198552	Physical games tend to go on sale from the retailer and things like that.
2200154	2206043	If nothing else, it shows that Nintendo is looking at this and is taking an interest in it.
2207245	2215958	I'm left to believe they have to be hearing what people on the internet are saying even if they're not directly doing anything about it yet.
2216140	2231162	and I doubt they will for quite some time because I'm sure they have people are saying things they don't like well but there is another thing that could be playing into this as well and that could be the fact that physical games versus digital games is going to get more complicated because of tariffs
2231142	2237551	and all that stupidity that is now enacted is that it's going to make the cost of physical games more expensive.
2237932	2240175	So digital game for that reason is going to be more alluring.
2240195	2243079	So I think there's some advantage to maybe having that data as well.
2243099	2258681	And that may be completely outside the discussion of the game key cards, which actually, I mean, again, in the wake of tariffs, those game key cards are even like 10 times worse because now it's like you're paying more for a game.
2258881	2260103	For what?
2260083	2260844	for nothing.
2261345	2268174	So like, you know, I, I just, a lot is pretty screwy with all that system right now.
2268194	2270337	So, you know, we'll see what comes of it for sure.
2271038	2279629	So, but no, no, obviously no word on what's going to be done with the survey results yet, but Nintendo has obviously made it very clear.
2280090	2281051	They have enough data.
2281071	2281812	Thank you very much.
2283274	2283475	All right.
2283555	2284015	DarkSakura.
2284055	2284376	Thank you.
2284396	2285818	Drive through.
2285838	2285938	Yeah.
2286661	2292047	So there's something new from the Video Game History Foundation.
2293248	2296572	And you know, they're not just looking at games.
2296632	2298994	They're looking at anything related to games.
2299675	2306442	And so they have got the rights to release a computer entertainer.
2306843	2311107	Actually, it started as a video game update, which was a newsletter for U.S.
2311187	2314851	mail order retailer Video Takeout, which I had never heard of.
2314891	2316533	I don't think we had one where I lived.
2316513	2342487	and it ran from 1982 to 1990 and it actually was co-edited by Mary Lou Badeau and Celeste Dolan and means it is also one of the earliest console video game magazines run by women and so every issue of it is available through the Video Game History Foundation That's cool
2343665	2345790	Yeah, I think that's really neat.
2345810	2355233	And certainly I'm glad that they are looking at, you know, not just the games, but anything related to the culture, you know.
2355253	2355514	Yeah.
2355855	2360185	And this is a very important piece of women's history as well.
2360707	2360847	Mm-hmm.
2362092	2372163	Yeah, it is important to also have that sort of like snapshot in time because, you know, just being able to kind of explain to people what gaming was like in a different era.
2372304	2376889	You know, sometimes people don't really have that reference, you know, not to sound like the old man on the block, but it's true.
2377309	2382195	You know, people that didn't grow up on Atari 2600 don't have a sense of just how it was.
2382255	2387281	I mean, there's going to come a time when, you know, the gamers are like, oh, what was an instruction manual?
2387341	2387641	What's that?
2387661	2390044	You just go on the internet to find whatever you needed?
2390244	2390344	Yeah.
2390324	2397397	Like, you know, the art of the instruction manual is sadly going to be long gone, except for, I guess, niche collector's editions and things like that.
2397897	2405591	But yeah, it's definitely preserving a moment in time, which I think is really good.
2408276	2408376	Yeah.
2408396	2408516	Yeah.
2408536	2411181	But I mean, this is all what we grew up with.
2411501	2412223	Mm-hmm.
2412243	2412383	Mm-hmm.
2412751	2417619	Although I don't recall this particular magazine, so I'm excited to see more about it.
2418020	2424131	Because, you know, you used to have to buy those magazines and we couldn't afford them all.
2424251	2428017	So it's cool that we can sort of go back and revisit that now.
2429440	2429680	Yeah.
2429980	2435568	DarkTC in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, definitely appreciate their preservation efforts.
2435588	2436409	Absolutely.
2436429	2439633	When we talk about games preservation, it needs to be all of it, right?
2439734	2446923	Questbuster says, I was curious and took a look and I found a Dragon Stomper release in their January 83 issue.
2447845	2448606	Wow, January 83.
2448986	2449547	What a throwback.
2450569	2450789	Okay.
2451770	2454674	Let's move on, I guess, to more modern sensibilities.
2454694	2455115	Yeah, Loki?
2456497	2456717	Yep.
2457618	2458840	So definitely...
2459292	2471268	You know, there comes a time that companies have to reflect upon their decisions and realize that maybe it wasn't the kids that are wrong.
2471468	2474432	Maybe I was a bit wrong, but not too much.
2474452	2476715	They don't want to take full responsibility, obviously.
2476735	2484405	But, you know, this focus with a lot of companies focusing on live service games, Sony being one of those.
2485043	2488808	Run into some hiccups, obviously, with some games like Concord and the like.
2490030	2497039	Basically saying during a, you know, financial Q&A that, yeah, it's not going entirely smoothly.
2498000	2502366	Somewhat negative news has been coming out if we look at the past five years.
2502386	2506631	Five years ago, live service games were almost non-existent from PlayStation Studios.
2507292	2511878	We have Helldivers 2, MLB The Show, Gran Turismo 7, and Destiny's 2.
2511858	2527588	um so we have four live service or four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner but you know it's I think a little bit harder to get another like kind of
2528513	2553728	and so on.
2554298	2565842	And it says, of course, we recognize there are still many issues, so we should learn the lessons from our mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there's less waste and it's more smooth.
2566644	2570552	And it's also something that people want because, you know, Concord sucked.
2570954	2573918	Well, and they are so nervous about Marathon.
2573938	2577663	And, you know, the early testing of Marathon, I don't think went super great.
2578123	2580687	So there's still a lot to be cooked with that game.
2580707	2583010	But that game has so much writing on it right now.
2583731	2593424	And I don't know if the gaming population is in the same space that they were for a game like Marathon to be truly successful.
2593584	2594024	I don't know.
2594044	2596067	I worry for that one.
2596047	2601157	It's because they focus more on the like, how are we going to monetize this?
2601177	2607850	How is this going to be, you know, how are we going to profit from this versus making a good game?
2607870	2609834	And that's the problem with like Concord.
2610194	2611818	That's the problem with Marathon.
2611998	2613060	It's like,
2613040	2633968	you take the live service part out of it if it was just hey here's a game we're going to release later this year and we're going to show it off to you in like a demo and the demo plays like garbage you're going to be like whoa hold on I don't want to purchase this and so that's the thing it's like it doesn't you can take the live service out of the equation stop putting out unfinished games
2633948	2647789	from anybody that goes to a lot of different companies stop putting out unfinished games and then when you do decide to not listen to the audience and do it anyways don't be surprised when it bites you in the ass
2648157	2654904	Well, and I think gamers are also just becoming a lot more aware that like video games are, you know, PlayStation 5 games are $70.
2655024	2659608	And then you're going to come out with a game that asks you for more money on top of that.
2659968	2666675	Like, I think gamers are becoming more and more aware, like it's going to take a really special kind of game for me to plunk down that kind of money.
2666695	2676004	And I have to either, you know, have a story that really fucking moves me or like a player versus player type of mode that really entices me to come back over and over and over again.
2675984	2698532	and I think that's just a riskier and riskier thing to do you know when games were $50 you know I think people are just becoming more and more aware especially and then versus of course the free to play games because I think the biggest competitor for a game like Marathon ends up being Fortnite because at the end of the day Fortnite is still free to put on your PlayStation and is a shooty bang bang game
2698715	2714293	so you have to give people that premium experience especially I would argue in a single player mode that that $70 is going to justify but I worry that especially in that single player mode it's not going to be there
2715269	2726263	Questbuster in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, Sony's efforts gave me the impression that they thought they couldn't fail by doing things like buying Bungie without realizing the luck part of success.
2726784	2730909	No one expected Helldivers 2 to explode the way it did, but there you are.
2731009	2736957	While Concord, which was created to bring that kind of success home, utterly collapsed.
2737780	2740748	And how's Overwatch 2 doing these days in that space?
2741310	2745661	Like, I feel like the team shooters in general are sort of declining.
2745681	2746143	Well, I don't know.
2746163	2750093	I guess Marvel Rivals is still kind of holding its own, especially with such a recognizable IP.
2750194	2751978	But I don't know, y'all.
2751998	2753342	Like, I just...
2753643	2757930	I know Marathon's a different kind of game, but I am worried.
2758070	2759953	I would love to be proven wrong.
2760534	2762858	I really do hope they take the time to get it right.
2763318	2769689	But I also know the budget to make a game like this isn't limitless.
2770430	2776259	And the longer it goes on, the more they're going to feel the need to nickel and dime the players to try to make the money back.
2776279	2776900	Yeah.
2778027	2782775	SD100 Matt in chat says, I sadly haven't gone back to Overwatch 2 since Marvel Rivals came out.
2782815	2783636	I don't think it's just you.
2784618	2785700	I do not think it's just you.
2787182	2788024	All right, well, moving on.
2789366	2794395	This is a very interesting patent that Nintendo has put out there.
2794415	2796458	It is for a crank.
2796877	2818142	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2818257	2825410	and perhaps the crank could be used in something like, I don't know, Animal Crossing when people go fishing or something.
2825430	2828094	Maybe there's some Dreamcast games they could bring back with this.
2828114	2828615	I don't know.
2829497	2835768	Or the interesting thing about a crank, maybe try to lure some ports of Playdate games.
2835888	2839755	Now, granted, the Playdate is a very different type of system.
2840236	2842780	It doesn't run things on the same level.
2843924	2848709	I don't even think they considered Playdate to be any sort of competition whatsoever.
2848869	2856017	I don't think so either, but certainly, you know, like, hey, we have the ability to put this game on our store too.
2856538	2856878	I don't know.
2856958	2864186	I don't know if the Playdate is as serious of a thing as it is, you know, some type of just new control accessory or maybe inspired by the Playdate.
2864566	2870193	Like, hey, what if we took that crank idea the Playdate has and put it on the Nintendo console?
2870473	2870573	Yeah.
2870553	2873519	What if we patent it and then we sue them for using the crank?
2873940	2874862	Because we're evil.
2875203	2875583	I hope not.
2875603	2882057	Well, the patent is for the Switch 2 and the way it interfaces with the Switch 2 controller specifically.
2882498	2885524	Yeah, but you know, I don't put anything past Nintendo, unfortunately.
2885684	2886165	Could be.
2887192	2888734	We'll see.
2890636	2896763	Just a reminder, there were a lot of wild accessories during the Wii because that Wiimote would click into a lot of things.
2896783	2898826	The plastic steering wheel, hello.
2899306	2901188	I remember there was a fishing rod for the Wii.
2901349	2904092	I remember that being a thing.
2904132	2905934	That was an official Mario Kart thing.
2905954	2908016	That was day one for the Switch 2.
2908137	2909318	That's right.
2909348	2911974	So, we'll see.
2911995	2913939	We'll see if anything comes to this.
2913959	2918972	Because again, just because it gets trademarked, it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
2920115	2920696	But it might.
2921518	2923343	Anyway, let's move on.
2923363	2924846	Some exciting stuff in retro news.
2924886	2925448	Yeah, DarkSakura?
2925468	2925568	Yeah.
2929396	2931960	Yeah, sorry, I had to swallow.
2933282	2947963	So for fans of Evercade, there is a new release coming out, which is the Rare Collection 1 and a ZX Spectrum set.
2947983	2948704	So...
2949815	2951878	It's actually looking pretty good.
2953139	2958146	It actually says it's the debut of ZX Spectrum emulation on Evercade.
2959068	2970563	So this is also going to include some of the early NES games, Cobra Triangle, RC Pro-Am, and Battletoads, and the arcade version of Battletoads, and then Conker's Pocket Tales from Game Boy Color.
2971504	2972926	So there you go.
2974568	2975069	I'm excited.
2975289	2978674	I think I want to pick up one of those rare cartridges.
2979127	2983495	All right, cool.
2985038	3002670	Loki.
3004253	3004614	All right.
3005395	3010022	Well, we got good news that Digital Foundry is now going to be going independent.
3010202	3019416	They've decided to leave IGN and have, I think, purchased back their company to be able to actually take it independent.
3019497	3028270	So, of course, if you're not familiar with Digital Foundry, they do a lot of these different kind of evaluations of games and see how well the visuals and everything run.
3028250	3057919	and like you'll even look at like frame timings and stuff like that it's where you get a lot of this news about oh yeah this Switch game was it was basically a postage stamp that they're upscaling to 1080p you know that type of stuff but it is exciting to see you know them out from underneath IGN and yeah so they announced that to everybody on their podcast and going forward they're going to be operating independently so that's
3058220	3058822	Pretty awesome.
3060967	3064397	Not the first company in the media space to go independent.
3064437	3066001	I feel like there's been quite a few this year.
3066041	3067104	It's like a little bit of a theme.
3067204	3068347	So congrats.
3068367	3069771	That's great.
3070052	3073341	I think it's almost always good news for these companies in these situations.
3073361	3074203	So that's great.
3075466	3091956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3091936	3110147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3110127	3110628	That's right.
3110729	3112614	A new trailer was released this week.
3112634	3114138	So we don't know all the details.
3114158	3115642	We just know what's in the trailer.
3116344	3121338	And there was also, I guess, a cannibalism update that was done.
3121559	3123404	I think we talked about that on a prior episode.
3123424	3125149	Yeah, that was last week, I think.
3125129	3152537	DarkSakura
3152517	3154021	that you have to avoid.
3154201	3169041	Whereas the game has, for example, a jungle with rain that makes the surfaces slippery, the snow that has cold air or wind that you have to avoid and otherwise you freeze to death, the lava one that
3169662	3191063	you know don't fall into lava where the mountains will burst in the fire and that type of stuff so yeah it's it'll be interesting glad to see that they're still supporting it now for those of you that like to do your quests on discord because that's a thing now you play certain games you get little limited time things or little currency to buy you know flair on discord or what have you
3191043	3196788	Peak will be having a limited time exclusive quest in Discord or with Discord.
3196848	3198550	It will be live just for next week.
3198570	3200572	So between August 11th and August 17th.
3201132	3203474	And you get a Bing Bong avatar for that.
3203494	3203915	Bing Bong.
3204976	3207458	But I think that's what the little characters are called in that game.
3208138	3211041	Also new achievements apparently are coming as well.
3211201	3213984	So that is all happening tomorrow.
3214004	3215545	So please look forward to it.
3215565	3221050	Now I thought this is not directly related to the expansion, but I thought this was interesting.
3221030	3245130	Death by Daylight Death by Daylight
3245110	3252157	But then the most important Roblox game that is an original, at least as far as I know, is the fashion dress up game.
3252217	3253639	God, why can't I remember the name of that game?
3253659	3254580	There's so much.
3254660	3256302	Yeah, there's so good.
3256322	3256982	There's that.
3257062	3258524	There's Grow a Garden.
3258584	3262087	There's but there's knockoffs of other games all the time.
3262108	3265551	Like, I know I've seen the Dead by Daylight one, you know, so much.
3265571	3266152	Yeah.
3266172	3274240	So, of course, there is a peak as in the game we were just talking about a copy on Roblox.
3274388	3275774	It's not even a knockoff.
3275814	3280795	They've ripped off full... The assets look the same.
3280875	3282964	They're just straight up ripping it off.
3283315	3293271	Well, on the official X account, because unfortunately some companies still use X and support its current owner, but I realize there's a lot of companies doing it, so it is what it is.
3293912	3308175	AgroCrab Games put out a very interesting post on X saying, TBH would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff.
3308155	3331834	so we're hearing that word slop a lot with AI related things in this day and age but now it's being thrown at this too like Roblox knockoffs being slop which I mean I could see that they kind of are I am like honestly so surprised that they haven't cracked that copyright holders haven't cracked down on Roblox like yeah
3331949	3359172	it's like the largest gaming platform right now and there is so much rampant copyright theft just so much some of it is unintentional because it's kids making the game but that said, there's a lot of it that is adults making these games full well understanding that yeah, I'm ripping off the copyright for this so it's unfortunate
3360215	3368609	and apparently Cliff in the screenshot that was shared on social media already had 160,000 visits.
3368629	3370492	So it's not like this is some underground thing.
3370632	3373357	It's already very much out there.
3373978	3379928	Interesting point also made along these same lines about slop and AI.
3379908	3408531	and I know this we talked about this a couple weeks ago the PlayStation store AI generated bullshit that is meant to cash in on different trends in gaming right now so that's another you know place so yeah I I feel like this is all gonna come to an apex legally at some point so we'll see interesting interesting uh and a lot of folks comment giving the sorry a lot of folks in chat giving the appropriate comment here which is oof
3409777	3415296	Yes, that would be the appropriate comment to this story.
3415316	3418808	Let's go to our next segment and take a trip down memory lane, shall we?
3429470	3437362	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3437382	3440166	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3440807	3441127	All right.
3441327	3450080	And once a month, DarkSakura puts a little twist on things and she picks a game that for 2025, it is a classic.
3450240	3453265	It was a game and now it's in the arcade.
3453525	3456810	So what is the classic game to arcade of the month, DarkSakura?
3457668	3460412	Well, I mean, it's been in the arcade for a hot minute.
3462034	3466560	So the game is Injustice Gods Among Us.
3468743	3475873	Now, this segment doesn't necessarily have to encompass the 10-year limit, you know what I mean?
3476694	3481400	Although Injustice does fall in the 10-year limit since the game came out in 2013.
3481480	3487388	But in 2017, the arcade version came out.
3487773	3510658	and uh you uh I mean it's a full-on arcade port of wait why is this saying the mobile game yeah of the mobile game interesting I didn't realize that part but it was made by Raw Thrills working with NetherRealm Studio and it first came out in Dave and Buster's before a worldwide release so um
3512292	3513454	You know what?
3514195	3518120	This is weird because it says that you have cards.
3519202	3522146	Yeah, you have cards that you scan for your character.
3523348	3528595	And then it plays like the mobile version with the push and hold buttons.
3528615	3529897	There's six buttons all together.
3530458	3533142	So you have quick attack block and a strong attack.
3533282	3534864	And then you have a special attack button.
3534904	3541253	And finally, you have your start and buy a card without playing the game.
3541233	3545244	And it also is your tag-in button during the battle.
3545866	3547892	But you can't choose what attack you want to use.
3548834	3555613	You just have to use the special button to do your special, no matter how much your bar is filled up.
3556808	3563059	It's kind of like weird mini-game-ish sort of shenanigans going on.
3563940	3564682	It's really weird.
3564822	3570993	I had remembered that there was some catch to this game because I saw it and really didn't want to play it.
3571914	3572235	Um...
3573194	3582883	But yeah, this is really the mobile version, just a lot more scaled.
3583223	3595334	The Series 4 update had an instant super move that you can use when the battle begins, and you do need an additional credit to use it, and it'll give you a bonus card with an additional reward.
3596135	3599077	So you have to basically spend twice as much on a single match.
3599778	3603201	It's definitely something to suck up money, is what it is.
3603181	3618152	um as for um the game uh beneath uh actually where your character's name is a player uh the character's name
3618605	3640714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3640694	3657555	um you have many swapping games for different special attacks and you will always have a countdown um and then you have a single player ladder a medium ladder and a hard ladder um and then of course there's a
3658514	3664422	Your cards will also be different outfits for some of the characters.
3664522	3668808	You can get the same character just with different outfits.
3668848	3672512	They have different power levels.
3673233	3679562	For example, in the Silver set, if you had Bane, there's a Nightfall and then there's a Regime version.
3680102	3683627	The Nightfall has 65 power levels.
3683607	3686031	and 81 Defense.
3686231	3690157	And the Regime one has 63 power and 73 defense, so it's a little bit different.
3690177	3693142	However, it has higher speed than the Nightfall one.
3693182	3695004	So, you know, there's different trade-offs and everything.
3695064	3696867	It seems pretty balanced.
3696887	3700633	You get all kinds of different versions of the characters that way in different outfits.
3702696	3703337	So...
3705005	3710172	The cards themselves, of course, have different stats.
3710192	3714337	So like for the odds of pulling a card.
3714558	3724090	So for bronze, it's 20%, silver 26%, gold 46%, which is pretty good because the gold I think is the one that's got like Batman and all of that on there.
3724992	3725292	Yeah.
3726892	3740450	The team cards are 3%, boss cards are 2.5%, gear is 2.5%, and the foil cards are 33% overall split between bronze, silver, gold, team, and boss and gear.
3741231	3745217	So it's, yeah.
3745237	3750283	But anyway, this is a game that's definitely designed to suck up money.
3751525	3752967	So yeah, I just say play at home.
3755005	3764425	That's a lot.
3764759	3786160	that's more like the Dragon Ball Z game where you actually have your own character in the universe who goes on the different adventures trying to fix weird universal stuff but it's a lot more of an adventure game and I think a little bit less of a money sink yeah
3787152	3789014	It's definitely a lot more involved.
3789034	3795442	This is just fighting where that one is, I think, fighting and adventure and full story and everything.
3795682	3797144	And this looks like a mobile game.
3797525	3798406	It does.
3799187	3800488	I saw this not that long ago.
3800508	3801910	They have one of these at Roseville Golf Land.
3802230	3804834	My work had a thingy thing at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.
3805274	3806796	And I was like, oh, it's an Injustice game.
3806816	3807317	And it uses cards.
3807337	3809479	Because I thought, oh, the cards look like they might be neat.
3809499	3811942	But then I looked at the price and I was like, hmm.
3812643	3813524	And the game looked bad.
3813544	3815927	I think they had it when we all went there before.
3816208	3816448	Yeah.
3816468	3816568	Yeah.
3816937	3818019	Yeah, true, true.
3818700	3823009	I mean, if, I mean, Roosevelt Golf Land with money gobblers.
3823450	3823791	No.
3824031	3825774	No.
3825794	3826035	All right.
3826055	3826776	Never gasp.
3827277	3828440	Gasp, I say gasp.
3829041	3835634	There it is, your classic game to arcade, because not all of them are upgrades necessarily, of the month.
3836175	3837257	Injustice.
3837845	3838186	All right.
3839148	3841974	With that, we have some more things to get into.
3842315	3843417	Right.
3844039	3849110	Before we wrap up tonight, we have some rapid fire news, some quick headlines to talk about here.
3849230	3851736	So we'll go over to Loki with some rapid fire news.
3852458	3871378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3871358	3876006	Can't forget the other Ubisoft project on Apple TV, Mythic Quest.
3876026	3889969	So obviously having several successful seasons of that series, it only makes sense that they would want to have him adapt one of their actual properties instead of just coming up with something brand new.
3890349	3896860	Then, of course, they're also going to feature Noah Hawley of Fargo, that series.
3896840	3925918	and apparently the collaboration they said is an embarrassment of riches because Far Cry you know they feel that it will let itself well to TV and yeah so interesting to see and it's apparently supposed to be on FX is where they're targeting that I don't know we'll see I'll be interested to check it out I do like some Far Cry early Far Cry so much newer stuff but
3926033	3946573	and then also really cool and kind of unexpected we got an announcement that Heretic and Hexen have been updated and then of course re-released now as part yep as part of this was a QuakeCon 2025 announcement finally so finally yep so um
3947127	3957061	Yeah, they're basically getting the full treatment, being updated and remastered for modern consoles and Steam.
3957621	3962248	And then also, along with that, they even have more campaigns as well.
3962268	3965011	There's, I think, a new campaign for both games.
3965813	3972802	And they have, of course, online cross-platform deathmatch co-op for up to 16 players, split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 8 players.
3973884	3974164	Um...
3975292	4003071	Toggleable soundtrack, they have an enhanced soundtrack, plus you have the original soundtrack as well 4K, 120 FPS, lots of accessibility stuff added into the game as well Modern controller support, widescreen support, save load All the bells and whistles Yeah, that's pretty cool, and it's on Game Pass, so if you have Game Pass, you can just pick it up Yep I totally forgot that this came out, and I need to check it out
4004823	4022562	well ain't this something because it's already in my library oh apparently if you had an earlier version of it you got the upgrade for free I heard it was they've done this with Doom and stuff before like when they recently if you had bought Doom previously that you got the new one for free so maybe you uh
4022542	4024724	I'm not at all sad about this.
4024744	4025545	Not at all.
4026065	4037717	And I don't know if you would ever have a scenario where you would need this, but they did include the original DOS versions of the game with the purchase of it as well.
4038117	4042141	So if you do pick up that collection on Steam or something like that, you still get the DOS versions.
4042161	4043963	Maybe you have a DOS machine.
4044103	4046646	If you have an old DOS machine that you want to play it on, I guess.
4046926	4047446	That'd be cool.
4047847	4050169	DOS emulator for Mac.
4050149	4052231	The DOS emulator for Mac.
4052271	4054654	The irony is not lost.
4054674	4061002	Gotta get my config sys and auto exec set up and I'll be ready to game soon.
4061662	4063805	As soon as I figure out how to allocate all that RAM.
4064446	4066988	All that 4 megabytes of RAM.
4067049	4068791	I don't actually know what this is.
4068811	4072114	This may have been 8 or 16 megabytes at the time.
4072975	4076880	Of it misreading the RAM and just going fast.
4077120	4078422	Oh, the game's already done.
4078442	4078722	Bye.
4079630	4085823	Orange Right and Chat says, check my GOG library.
4086003	4087326	I have the new remaster.
4087386	4090252	Well, you know those attention whores were not going to be left out.
4090272	4093538	As I've called them last week, girl, oh girl, they're not going to miss that boat.
4094661	4096845	Girl, oh girl, get on that trend.
4096960	4113822	DarkSakura
4115590	4129281	Well, one of my personal heroes, Hip Tanaka, also real name Tanaka Hirokazu, is interested in doing video game soundtracks again.
4130043	4134713	He's one of the absolute legends of chiptune music.
4134693	4141480	started with Nintendo in 1980 as an in-house composer during the 8-bit and 16-bit era.
4142000	4147726	And he actually helped design and program the audio hardware for the Famicom slash NES and the Game Boy.
4148166	4156695	He's also done the soundtracks for Super Mario Land, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario, the Game Boy version of Tetris.
4157055	4164683	Co-composed the soundtracks for Mother and for Mother 2 or Earthbound with Suzuki Keiichi.
4164663	4178074	and he wrote songs for the Pokemon anime and Nintendo said he wasn't allowed to do it anymore because it said he was working for another company so he resigned from Nintendo and worked with Creatures Inc.
4178094	4180900	instead and now he was the president of the company.
4181318	4184122	But now he's wanting to get back into game music.
4184503	4185945	And I think that's cool.
4188308	4194537	He made a soundtrack for a game called Oasis from a studio called 17-Bit.
4195619	4196961	And now I have to find that.
4197642	4199464	But, oh, it looks cute.
4201127	4203951	But anyway, yeah, he's ready to go.
4206158	4206719	All right.
4207019	4230073	Excited to see what he comes up with.
4230053	4250779	Diablo 4, Diablo 2 Remaster Diablo 3, Diablo 4 Remaster
4250759	4252922	Immortal, for better or worse, was under his launch.
4253002	4255787	So he's done a lot with driving the Diablo franchise.
4256468	4267324	But he says, after five years driving the Diablo franchise with four big launches, it's time to step away from Blizzard and Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next.
4267344	4271811	I'm proud of what we've built and excited of what's ahead for Diablo and for me.
4272332	4277119	And that was his post over on Blue Sky at rodferguson.bsky.
4277620	4279002	So, yeah.
4279383	4279483	Yeah.
4279463	4283790	Also of note, this comes right after a bunch of layoffs were done by Microsoft.
4284111	4288678	He was not technically part of the layoffs, but interesting.
4288738	4296031	Phil Spencer did reply and said you brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming's most iconic franchises.
4296451	4298374	Playing Diablo 4 with you was a blast.
4298395	4301019	Thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.
4301039	4304104	So we will see where he pops up next.
4304928	4308060	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
4308462	4312698	I doubt there's a new Diablo game coming out this week, but maybe there is something else you want to check out.
4312718	4314264	So let's go to the US, Loki.
4314284	4315107	What's coming out?
4315795	4323846	We don't have a whole lot this week, but we've got Ra Ra Boom on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
4325028	4328433	We've got Senua's Saga Hellblade 2 on PlayStation 5.
4329655	4336064	Let's see, Dwarf Romantic on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
4337005	4341732	Drag X Drive on Nintendo Switch 2.
4342493	4344115	You can check that out.
4344095	4366255	Madden NFL 26 on PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Midnight Murder Club on PC and PlayStation 5 Relic Hunters Legends on PC and Xbox Series Warhammer 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition on PC
4367230	4377679	Bendy Lone Wolf on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series and finally on PC, Nintendo Switch, off
4379144	4379905	I'm gonna play off.
4380325	4382107	Not on, but off.
4382127	4382928	Not on, but off.
4383409	4383889	That's right.
4385030	4386392	Bug off.
4386412	4405532	Alright, let's quickly, I wanted to mention before I go to Japanese releases, QuestBuster in chat made a comment about the Rod Ferguson bit that I thought was a really interesting prediction saying, there's speculation from some corners that Ferguson might go over to help Bioshock 4 after its recent shakeup given what he's done before.
4405932	4407514	That's a very...
4407494	4408535	Interesting.
4408575	4415244	We're going to have to bring out the wheel of plausibility for that one because I would rank that high on the wheel of plausibility, to be honest.
4415284	4417126	That's a really good guess.
4417146	4419409	So thank you for bringing that one to my attention, Quest Buster.
4420150	4423374	Anyway, let's go to Japan and check out the releases in Japan.
4423434	4430122	Although I will say on the PlayStation 5 and the Switch 2, it seems to be very quiet in Japan this week.
4430162	4431584	I'm not sure what the reason for that is.
4432645	4435729	Yeah, the only releases I have are on the 21st.
4435709	4440455	So we have a quiet week in Japan for releases for whatever reason.
4440775	4442117	Is there anything like on PlayStation 4?
4442317	4443598	No.
4443619	4444640	No games coming out this week.
4444660	4444940	I don't know.
4444960	4445821	It's not Golden Week.
4445921	4447083	I know when that is now.
4447103	4448705	After all these years, I figured that out.
4448725	4449305	It's not that.
4449405	4451108	It's just... It's April and May.
4451128	4452309	Yeah, not a big release week.
4453090	4453390	All right.
4453851	4455433	Well, then we'll go to Europe, DarkSakura.
4457035	4461480	I'm actually double-checking holidays for August.
4461562	4473446	On the 11th, we have Madden NFL 26 for PC Switch 2, PS5, Xboxes, Whisper Mountain Outbreak for PC.
4473466	4482625	On the 12th, Abyssus on PC, also Fallen City Brawl, RaRaBoom PC, PS5, Xboxes.
4482605	4502554	Viewfinder for Xbox's World War Z VR from MetaQuest PC Senua's Saga Hellblade 2 for PS5 EA Sports Med and NFL 26 for Switch 2 A Fistful of Yankees for PC
4502534	4529419	Iwakura Aria for PC and Switch, Beneath the Six for PC, Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War Definitive Edition for PC, Kevin Tom's Football Star Manager PC, and I am reckoning that this is real football and not American football, Ovis Loop for PC, Voxelgram 2 for PC, Drag X Drive for Switch 2 on the 15th, Robert on Earth for PC, and Off for PC and Switch.
4531323	4531864	All right.
4533087	4537057	Yeah, there was a comment in chat about, could it be back to school week in Japan?
4537158	4541188	And that was my initial thought, but it turns out, yeah, Japan's on it.
4541208	4544235	The culture in Japan is more spring-oriented for school starts.
4544255	4546080	Today is Mountain Day, but that's it.
4546361	4547323	That's it.
4547303	4562612	Thank you for watching!
4563200	4570886	I am one of those people that loves pretty much anything dropout, but Game Changer especially.
4570907	4572007	Big fan of Sam Reich.
4572668	4592785	So Sam Reich sat down for an interview with Kotaku talking about Game Changer and their seventh season, but one of the topics that got brought up was because they've been starting to implement video games into some of their challenges that they do on Game Changer that
4592765	4598191	It's like, well, hey, would you like to just adapt one of your dropout properties into a game?
4598391	4599532	And they're like, yeah, for sure.
4600373	4613848	The, I think, issue, and like most things with dropout, because it is a small independent company making all this stuff, it's just a matter of the time it would take to do all that and the resources it would take to do all that.
4613868	4617051	And that's kind of what Sam is saying here, basically, that...
4617031	4617613	Yeah, for sure.
4617954	4621283	I think we would be into that.
4621383	4622326	We've talked about it.
4622807	4632053	And I think it's like at this point, it's honestly more than anything just the bandwidth issue, which is if we're going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it.
4632033	4634796	and we're not going to farm out the IP to some third party.
4634816	4642624	We want it to feel personal and it needs to be something therefore that we're excited about that feels different enough from what's out there and feels worth our time.
4643365	4656859	And that basically the two series that Sam at least envisions that could possibly be converted into a game would be Dimension 20 and of course Game Changer.
4656879	4661584	I could absolutely see Dimension 20 since it's rooted in kind of
4661564	4691233	High Fantasy Dungeons and Dragons type stuff so there's a lot you could do there with that but yeah I'd be excited to see that and they had some of the previous stuff with Game Changer they've done simple things like a maze game that they had and then a ski free clone that they featured in that as well so it's it'd be interesting to see if they did something with that interesting alright
4692412	4696857	Well, that was our last... I now have the weenus running through my head.
4698438	4699179	Thanks, Nick!
4699760	4703544	Honestly, like, you know, the dropout is just great.
4703584	4705105	Just go subscribe.
4705866	4709430	I only see the little clips that come through on TikTok, but it seems pretty humorous.
4710011	4711312	It's like $7 a month.
4711612	4715416	And it's like the, you know, Game Changer is a really fun series.
4715436	4716257	That's a Twitch site.
4716477	4719060	Dimension 20, you know, uh...
4719817	4722226	Dimension 20 is just absolutely worth it.
4722286	4725137	I'm just anywhere where Burnley Mulligan is going to be.
4725157	4728510	But yeah, absolutely worth checking out.
4729132	4729553	All right.
4730974	4732957	That is our last slotted story for tonight.
4733177	4735300	So we have some time for some last minute stories.
4735400	4737282	I always like to check in with the mailbag as well.
4737422	4739225	I don't think I saw anything in there, but you never know.
4739425	4740386	We ain't got shit.
4740626	4740907	All right.
4741087	4746253	Well, if you want to add shit, participate at Orangelandradar.com is the place where you can send us an email.
4746434	4747695	There was already shit in there.
4747715	4748496	I cleaned it out.
4748516	4749738	Oh, all the fucking spam.
4749758	4751059	Annoyed.
4751820	4753182	Annoyed.
4753162	4756165	Anyway, I was checking the blue sky as well.
4756185	4758747	We didn't really get any questions on blue sky, which you can follow us on blue sky.
4758767	4762310	If you want at orange on trader.com, we use our domain as our blue sky handle.
4762651	4770538	Although I will shout out our buddies over at game buoy.org because they always are so nice to shout us out and leave us a little tag on social media.
4770618	4776403	So I just want to shout out our friends over at game buoy.org video game podcast, another show here at the voice geeks network.
4777064	4778185	I have, I'm going to be honest.
4778205	4781548	I haven't checked out their latest episode yet, but I know it just went up.
4781528	4784851	So that will be probably something I'll listen to on my drive up to Oregon.
4784871	4785371	That'll be fun.
4786112	4787453	So, all right.
4788254	4793819	Anyhow, this is where we can open up for some calls.
4793839	4801326	If you want to join our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, which I would encourage you to join anyway and talk with us throughout the week.
4801366	4804108	You can also throw out some random questions in chat if you would like.
4804649	4806651	But otherwise, I will check with Loki.
4806871	4808933	I feel like there's a few stories that didn't make the cut tonight.
4809213	4811535	Was that game you were thinking of Dressed to Impress?
4811515	4814700	Yes, Dressed to Impress was the Roblox game I was trying to think of.
4817123	4818926	I have a little teeny news.
4818946	4819867	Oh, what's that?
4820929	4822030	It's a World of Warcraft thing.
4823893	4828700	They did a new patch and you can lean on a wall now.
4828720	4830843	Wall leaning.
4830863	4834348	So you can look brooding and nonchalant.
4834368	4839376	But they did also add new dungeons, a new raid, a new delve, new story stuff, new zone.
4839396	4840898	But you can lean against a wall now.
4841384	4854713	I would love to see Sassy Pants do that, though.
4855295	4856638	Aw, my old character.
4857720	4858161	Aw.
4859170	4888823	I did play World of Warcraft not that long ago I checked out the most recent expansion it was fine I just I don't really have interest in the long term like the rating and all that stuff going on to be fair Final Fantasy 14 I haven't really cared about this most recent patch like I'm I'm really done with this expansion I just want them to move on to the next one which I guess this patch finishes the story of the current expansion I know but I I'm just gonna be honest I've been a fan of 14 for over a decade I just don't care about this story I'm done
4888803	4908583	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4908563	4910165	for, you know, especially that type of stuff.
4910185	4919537	But also in Modern WoW, they really have added, I think because of 14, you know, they've added a lot to WoW that, you know, the UI is extremely customizable now.
4919557	4925465	I really like the Delves, which are kind of like their solo or small party content that they have in the game.
4925485	4926626	I think it's really interesting.
4926647	4930892	So, you know, there's plenty to do in Modern WoW.
4930872	4956728	retail wow it's just it's weird to get caught up with it I mean you you level a character through like a new tutorial island and then like you do like one expansion worth of content you pick where Chromie sends you or you do the most recent expansion if you don't have Chromie sends you somewhere else um and then like you get into the newest expansion from there but it's just it's it's interesting how contained the expansions are now I don't know
4956708	4975763	Yeah, I think they have to because they've moved the story so far ahead.
4975743	4980490	S, Joe and Hunter Matt says Rob, did you see or watch the new season of Wednesday?
4980951	4983234	Did you see who was cast as Grandmama?
4983755	4987420	No, I didn't, but was that where Joanna Lumley was supposed to be in it?
4988722	4990825	Maybe I'm wrong.
4991026	4992207	Is that who plays Grandmama?
4992328	4992928	Okay, yes.
4993629	4994991	I need to see it for that reason.
4995011	4997054	No, I haven't had Netflix in years, actually.
4997555	4998957	But I need to see it.
4998977	5001601	I heard good things about Wednesday.
5002763	5005227	Have you seen the new season?
5005247	5005547	No.
5005662	5006964	Oh, I need to see it.
5008586	5010128	I actually didn't even watch the first season.
5011110	5011410	Did you?
5012432	5014294	Well, I'd watch the first season still.
5014314	5016277	I feel like I've been spoiled on enough.
5016397	5018320	I still need to watch Stranger Things Season 4.
5019121	5020183	I used to love that show.
5020223	5020944	I mean, I still do.
5021084	5023728	Rob, you need to come over and watch Ghosts with me.
5023748	5024189	Ghosts?
5025450	5026292	It's such a good show.
5026492	5029116	Like, is that the comedy show on CBS?
5029136	5029496	Yeah.
5030117	5030758	Oh.
5030958	5032000	I love it!
5032040	5037914	Well, I watched the British one for a while, and then I actually kind of like the US one better, which is weird.
5037934	5041442	That I have, because I have Paramount+, that's all the CBS stuff.
5041502	5042564	And they have Ghost UK on there.
5042584	5043867	I've got it all on my Apple TV.
5044669	5045230	Ah, okay.
5045491	5046533	That is so good!
5046573	5048798	Okay, interesting.
5048913	5049474	I'll check that out.
5049975	5052019	And you know me, I don't really watch shows.
5052039	5052600	Yeah, yeah.
5053001	5054003	That's my problem.
5054023	5055005	It's very little I watch.
5055947	5059414	So, because I'm too busy sitting in dunes parties in Final Fantasy XI.
5060496	5065065	Let me run back to Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories we want to talk about.
5065585	5068669	Yeah, we can talk about Battlefield 6's open beta.
5068869	5070772	So it's been very successful.
5071012	5079403	They had almost half a million players, nearly five times that of Battlefield 2042.
5080524	5087072	And then, of course, along with those players, they also managed to swat away 300,000 of them that were cheating.
5088775	5089956	So, you know.
5091623	5097888	But hey, you know, it's good at least that they're catching cheaters now and they can adapt it for the final game.
5097908	5101071	And then, of course, there'll be less cheaters in it, right, Larry?
5101351	5102632	That's the thought process at least.
5102853	5103593	Bye, cheaters.
5103773	5112001	Also, we talked about Bioshock 4 and how there was some issues with it, you know, coming out in development.
5112061	5114563	Thankfully, it has not been canceled.
5114863	5116645	So it is still in development.
5116885	5120668	But the clarification is that, you know, it is...
5121155	5149542	still having some trouble but they are working on getting that resolved so we shall see I hope so because I like Bioshock and I want a new one it's been too long it has alright well with that I think we're going to wrap up tonight's show DarkSakura I know you were on the fence about streaming tonight do you decide if you're going to do that or not I'm going to do it I said I would I'm just going to play some Mass Effect just you know maybe an hour or so cool
5150332	5152555	Might do Zaid's loyalty mission.
5152575	5155578	Let me do my typical spiel and then I'll turn it over to you for a final thought.

5172758	5175562	Thank you for all the kind words and comments.
5175903	5178266	I see an occasional YouTube comment pop in.
5178286	5179688	So thank you for all of that.
5179828	5180489	Appreciate it.
5180650	5182072	And please keep that coming.
5183494	5185417	Otherwise, let's get those final thoughts.
5185557	5189142	So DarkSakura, before you head off to space, your final thoughts tonight.
5192427	5195151	I'm too old for 13 hours.
5195171	5196293	That is a long marathon.
5198196	5199257	All right.
5199277	5199357	Bye.
5199598	5199878	Bye.
5201200	5202462	Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
5203218	5211799	Another week's going to go by and another week that I'm hoping I can finish the data pack that I've been working on for now five weeks, four weeks.
5211819	5212842	It's been a long time.
5212862	5213363	Oh boy.
5214305	5215626	Alright, let's see.
5215667	5223455	My final thought tonight is I downloaded this puzzle game on my phone that's pretty cute that one of my friends on Blue Sky was playing and I was like, I want to try that.
5223475	5225117	It's called Puzmo.
5225137	5226338	So shout out to Puzmo.
5226358	5233486	It's got all these weird... There's a crossword thing in it, which is actually my least favorite thing, but then they have other word games that are... I don't know.
5233606	5235789	I got sick of Wordle after six months.
5235849	5240514	I don't know how some of you are still playing it, but there's other types of word games in there I think are really interesting.
5240534	5244278	There was a poker game too that was kind of fun, so I'm going to give a shout out to Puzmo.
5244258	5246542	That's it.
5246703	5248406	I don't have a lot of other thoughts.
5248426	5255158	So my other thought would be I'm going to try to play something besides Nostalgia this week.
5255178	5257062	But we won't be here next week.
5257082	5259567	So I've got two weeks to do it, I guess.
5259647	5264075	Because I'm leaving town this Friday and I won't be back until Sunday night, which is why I'm missing a alarm.
5264596	5267802	But I hope you guys have a great gaming two weeks.
5267782	5271748	We'll be back in two weeks to recap just before I leave again for DragonCon.
5271768	5274291	So sorry about it, but August is busy and people have trips.
5274712	5276134	So I hope you all have a wonderful night.
5276454	5278798	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
