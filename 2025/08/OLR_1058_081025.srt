1
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:14,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that legendary games are getting good movies and TV shows, it's weird to realize how many of those games I haven't played.

2
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:22,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Fallout, The Witcher, most of the Castlevanias, and now Far Cry, which is in production apparently, but given many factors, it's a good idea to wait for a series release date before too much hype.

3
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:25,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I started Far Cry two or three times, but never really made progress.

4
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:29,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to for the narrative, but I'm only one trophy away from getting Platinum and Death Stranding 2.

5
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to get the band back together.

6
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about these stories and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:50,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight.

11
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:57,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Episode number 1058 of our show for tonight, August 10th of 2025.

12
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:58,499
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to talk about video games, very serious stuff, and never any tangents.

14
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:04,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Never, never.

15
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: With all of you live in our chat as we are taping live at the Voice Geeks Network.

16
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:12,496
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also joined by my co-host, of course, starting off with the one and only Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:13,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie.

18
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:14,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

19
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I still go by DarkSakura, you know.

20
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:17,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

21
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:20,245
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should say welcome back as well.

22
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:21,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

23
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:22,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

24
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:45,621
[SPEAKER_03]: brain suck sometimes uh you had a little marathon yesterday i was i was i was there for like the beginning and then i just left my computer on while i went and did other stuff yesterday but you went for a very long time i did and you know i i saw a few olr people there um not not not a lot

26
00:01:46,006 --> 00:02:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did a lot of Dead by Daylight and I did some Mass Effect 2 as sort of a palate cleanser but there were some very generous people who basically paid for my hotel room at Disneyland that's good

27
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:14,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to make sure that I've got enough money to cover TwitchCon and still be able to pay the bills.

28
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:22,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And do some tech repairs in the local studio.

29
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's practical.

30
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing practical stuff.

31
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:52,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could go to TwitchCon but at this point I have a conflict that weekend now so I can't go even if I made it work out last minute but I kept telling Alan he could go but yeah I'm out unfortunately so but I'm sure it'll be a good time well my friend who we've probably seen in my chat is Mabel Von Smallcat is coming with me we have a cute little Airbnb oh fun

32
00:02:52,814 --> 00:03:20,442
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we're going to Disneyland together that'll be fun and then it's gonna be pretty busy I'm going to probably be like flat on my face afterwards but I'm looking forward to it I've already started working on my cosplays and yeah well cosplay is singular since it's always the pig excited to see the latest evolution of your pig cosplay

33
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:23,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

34
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:24,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

35
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:25,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

36
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you're not going to TwitchCon either.

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad.

38
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:54,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what, Loki, I'm skipping the party.

39
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing as last year.

40
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:58,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the party sucked.

41
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Save yourself $100.

42
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:01,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not worth it.

43
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The food was okay.

44
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:10,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same without a Kim Petras concert and whoever else they had that one year.

45
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:11,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I didn't go.

46
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:12,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard it from the parking lot.

47
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:24,465
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, last year was great when you had people that couldn't sing screaming at one stage and then you had a DJ just two blocks down the other way playing loud music and then the music was just...

48
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,343
[SPEAKER_06]: grading against each other in the middle.

49
00:04:27,363 --> 00:04:28,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's fun.

50
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:29,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, love that.

51
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,778
[SPEAKER_03]: S0100, Matt, in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

52
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:41,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network right after the Bobby Blackwell show, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

53
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:43,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible.

54
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:59,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible.

55
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:02,231
[SPEAKER_03]: During the convention, it wasn't coming back to Vegas.

56
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:13,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just it would have been a lot better if it was at one of the hotel convention centers, which I've been to a Final Fantasy 14 event at the Rio.

57
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:17,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a big Star Trek convention at the Rio this weekend, actually, because I have a lot of friends there for my cruise.

58
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,750
[SPEAKER_03]: are there.

59
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Paris, I know one year had it.

60
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:31,708
[SPEAKER_03]: These places are fine, but yeah, TwitchCon was at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which just was really hard to get to, especially with a giant fucking concert going on that same weekend.

61
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:32,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just bad.

62
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:35,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And then F1 Formula Racing, it was terrible to get around Vegas.

63
00:05:35,614 --> 00:05:38,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to miss TwitchCon Vegas at all.

64
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I think San Diego is a much better city for it, except the one...

65
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:59,674
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to, like, um...

66
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:04,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also hard to find lodging in that area too.

67
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:14,135
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're willing to go further away and Uber in or whatever, then you might get lucky with Pacific Beach or something like that.

68
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:14,676
[SPEAKER_03]: They do.

69
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:18,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, that works.

70
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

71
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:46,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, probably cheaper than getting a hotel down in the grid somewhere.

72
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:47,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And how often are you staying in your hotel room?

73
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:47,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It really was.

74
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not.

75
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:51,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I had internet.

76
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I was happy.

77
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:57,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of conventions over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Rin Mari in chat says, Anyway, hi.

78
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to MAGFest this weekend.

79
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:04,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a ribbon for playing a rhythm game, meme song in 15 games, and no, it's not flower.

80
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you had fun at MAG West.

81
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those conventions I always mean to get to, but it's just like such a busy time of year for me.

82
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've always been curious about that.

83
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad you had a good time there.

84
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:20,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a couple other friends that go, and yeah, I need to get out there one year.

85
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:26,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had a lot of fun at MAG Fest the couple times that I went, and I'd love to go again, but again...

86
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,810
[SPEAKER_03]: since they don't do it in February.

87
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,938
[SPEAKER_03]: The times they did it in February were a fluke and that made it much easier to get to.

88
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:40,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it's like early January, it's harder for me to go cross-country to a thing like MAGFest as much as I'd love to go.

89
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:41,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, never say never.

90
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say...

91
00:07:43,857 --> 00:08:08,802
[SPEAKER_03]: DragonCon, DragonCon, DragonCon

92
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:23,777
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do have my final schedule, I'm not going to have time to meet people with these... Unfortunately, the types of panels these are, I'm not going to be able to meet and greet people from the show then.

93
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:36,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really best if you want to say hi, and I'm certainly happy to say hi, give you a little FaceTime, see how you're doing, whatever, unless you try to find me impromptu during the convention, which it does...

94
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:57,132
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

95
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:18,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Animes down there, BritTracks, we're right next door to BritTracks so there's a lot of tracks down there so in Galleria 6 we're going to be having a big meet and greet for content creators you do not have to be a content creator to be there you can just be an aspiring content creator or somebody that supports content creators and wants to find new ones that is A-OK so I encourage you to come down there and it's on a Thursday

96
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:34,813
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

97
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you what one of her cosplays is because she's posted about it on her TikTok and her Instagram.

98
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know it's not a secret.

99
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:52,297
[SPEAKER_03]: She is dressing as Parker Posey's character from Josie and the Pussycats in the scene with the Mega Records dress, which took her four.

100
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:56,423
[SPEAKER_03]: She had to make 400 vinyl stickers that say Mega Records on them to make this dress.

101
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:57,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible.

102
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:17,743
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

103
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:43,360
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

104
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm thinking about it.

105
00:10:46,509 --> 00:11:01,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly not, you know, 13 hours.

106
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:27,015
[SPEAKER_03]: and we actually have something about music games to start us off tonight how lovely because I'm sure y'all know by now but if you don't Orange Lounge Radio started because we all met playing DDR and that's pretty much exclusively what we used to talk about was music based games whether it was Konami's Bimani series or other you know adjacent games in that space but interesting blast from the past potentially coming back yeah Loki?

107
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:36,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was many, many years ago that we met up with the people from Red Octane to actually play... We were just talking about that like two weeks ago.

108
00:11:37,373 --> 00:12:01,812
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just talking about that.

109
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting back up where they left off, I guess.

110
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see.

111
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:19,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is I don't remember if it's the same folks behind it, but it basically Charles and Kai Huang, who were formerly part of Harmonix Music System.

112
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Those names do sound familiar, like super familiar.

113
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:29,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't claim I know everybody there, but like those names, I was like, I feel like those were some of the minds back in the day that were running Red Octane.

114
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:55,980
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Hero, please.

115
00:12:56,298 --> 00:13:26,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love that.

116
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:27,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

117
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

118
00:13:45,185 --> 00:14:06,552
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

119
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that it's different when you can have these songs that people instantly recognize from Journey or whatever bands that people turns their heads and makes them want to see, well, what's this going on?

120
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:22,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Guitar Hero did as well as it did, especially versus something like Guitar Freaks.

121
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,088
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take a step back once upon a time.

122
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:30,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami also was extremely risk adverse in America.

123
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely risk adverse.

124
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:39,205
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not want to put out DDR in the US and they quite frankly resisted it for an awful long time.

125
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if that was the music licensing or trying to do the peripheral and their data told them that a peripheral wouldn't work well here in the US or whatever.

126
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:51,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were quite frankly resistant to it for a very long time.

127
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:55,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why DDR did pretty good for them because they had a

128
00:14:55,587 --> 00:15:16,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Carameldansen

129
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:17,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Just shit the bed.

130
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:19,705
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave the Rock Revolution.

131
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what the hell were you thinking?

132
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:28,724
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the beginning of a really dark era for Konami.

133
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:33,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, Konami, I think we would all agree, especially post-pandemic.

134
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,116
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned it around.

135
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems to be in a much better place than they were.

136
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:39,622
[SPEAKER_03]: They have other people to run their license.

137
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:43,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Suikoden recently came back, and the HD remaster was pretty good.

138
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:49,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill, the 2 remake, a lot better than people were expecting, that's for sure.

139
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:52,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know people are still on the fence about this new one, but we'll see.

140
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It does seem like Konami is in a better place.

141
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,180
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, this isn't about Konami.

142
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,563
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have the exclusive...

143
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,665
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, on this.

144
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will have nothing to do with this game besides maybe some type of fee that has to be paid for trade.

145
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

146
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how all that legal stuff works.

147
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:14,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, Konami otherwise has very little to do with this.

148
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

149
00:16:16,368 --> 00:16:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

150
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranmari in chat says, American rhythm games don't appeal to me for a lot of the reasons they succeed.

151
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:29,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Long songs, songs just not my taste, super modes for scoring, so I just accept that I'll be a socially unacceptable rhythm gamer.

152
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:29,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

153
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I always had room in my heart for both.

154
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:40,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I always felt I was discovering more music in the Japanese games, but I could get my... Fuck.

155
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I just spilled a soda, guys.

156
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:42,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta go AFK.

157
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:43,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody take over.

158
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get your fuck.

159
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I will put it this way.

160
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,742
[SPEAKER_02]: What other people like isn't any of my business.

161
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:55,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad if they like it.

162
00:16:55,444 --> 00:16:56,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad if they don't.

163
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:01,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy what I enjoy, and what other people do or don't enjoy doesn't affect what I enjoy.

164
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, give me more rhythm games.

165
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Expand it, make more space for it, and we will start to see more of the niche stuff, I hope.

166
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,820
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's my theory.

167
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:13,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

168
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:22,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so it's going to be interesting to see what they actually come out with with this, since they said that they're going to be announcing their first rhythm game later this year.

169
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,430
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a rather large team.

170
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:30,375
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still within free mode of Embracer Group, so they're a subsidiary of Embracer.

171
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:40,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it doesn't mean that they're going to get sold off mid-development, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see what happens with this, because certainly there's been a

172
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:42,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite the break in rhythm games.

173
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:52,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they've kind of brought some of that back a little bit with the Fortnite Music Fest stuff, but it would be interesting to see kind of a resurgence.

174
00:17:52,121 --> 00:18:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And if something like say that they put out that's similar to like a Guitar Hero, but maybe not quite, you know, takes off, maybe Activision, Microsoft revisits Guitar Hero.

175
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:07,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always possible.

176
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:14,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they tried to do that and it didn't work out, but you know, I mean, it'd be interesting to see something come of this, you know.

177
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:28,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, in the end, I mean, we don't really know everything about it that there is to know, so I want to see what happens.

178
00:18:29,512 --> 00:18:57,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking to see if the guy that came to your house at one time that was Simon Tam and no, he's not listed as one of the employees here so he has moved on he was a producer at Red Octane but yeah, it'd be interesting to see what they have in mind for the rhythm game he was pretty cool though he was a nice guy he was nice very enthusiastic about it too

179
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:25,489
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly and it it's funny and I think he was a little amused at the Bimani stuff because I actually looked back in the video and one of my Bimani things was actually still in the corner yeah and it's also funny too because like uh I think Red Octane's almost their rebirth of this I want to say that they were making even peripherals for the Fortnite stuff as well I think they were doing that either that or it was um

180
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:47,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Harmonix was putting out anything, but somebody was making guitars for the Fortnite Music Fest stuff, so I'm wondering if that's still Red Octane, and if that's the case, it's like restarting the company the same way it started previously, which is kind of funny.

181
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:47,713
Hmm.

182
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:48,526
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm back.

183
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:49,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, everybody.

184
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:51,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The joys of doing live radio.

185
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I spilled a soda and it got all over.

186
00:19:53,614 --> 00:19:55,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to change my shorts.

187
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:56,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so annoyed.

188
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:59,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the chair is sticky, even though I toweled it off.

189
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:00,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm annoyed.

190
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chat, I see everybody in chat.

191
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

192
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I see bits and subs to help pay for clean.

193
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:06,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

194
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are really funny.

195
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody was asking if it was orange soda.

196
00:20:09,661 --> 00:20:11,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically...

197
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:33,225
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

198
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, when bringing these in the house, dropped them.

199
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the lid is a little funky because these got dropped.

200
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a thing from Costco and it got dropped on the ground.

201
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess when I went to drink it, I don't know.

202
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:46,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I forgot how to drink.

203
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So down to the ground it went and now my legs are sticky.

204
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be taking a shower after the show.

205
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That is annoying.

206
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:56,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

207
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:58,348
[SPEAKER_03]: The joys of live radio.

208
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:06,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry to distract from the topic of Red Octane Games, but until they actually announce what they're working on, I guess we don't have a whole lot left to say, do we?

209
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:08,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

210
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:09,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, that was my point.

211
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really know, so we're not going to know until they...

212
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:40,354
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

213
00:21:41,313 --> 00:22:00,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Vecna Adept Vecna

214
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:04,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Mass Effect 2.

215
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:05,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played Palia.

216
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:14,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually started playing a little bit more of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora because with the next movie coming out, I've been kind of getting back into it.

217
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:18,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually really enjoyed the story.

218
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:24,936
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't play much through the second DLC, so I figured I'd give it another go.

219
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:26,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, I'm really enjoying it.

220
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:31,165
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is gorgeous.

221
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:37,536
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that was, I mean, other than like my little phone dealy bobs, that's about it.

222
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

223
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

224
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to Loki.

225
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

226
00:22:42,642 --> 00:22:44,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was basically Minecraft.

227
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:50,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really get to play much of Minecraft because I was busy still coding the data pack.

228
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, multiple data packs because I rebuilt one that we were using this week as well, but just still working on coding the data pack.

229
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:02,441
[SPEAKER_06]: for our PvE arena that we're going to have.

230
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So still working on that.

231
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:06,266
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we got that.

232
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:10,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got my MCC TCG cards.

233
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have to crack open on a stream or something.

234
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of fun having some of the Minecraft event cards and stuff.

235
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

236
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I picked up a few more games that I don't know what I'm going to play.

237
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,341
[SPEAKER_06]: The one behind me, of course, is called The RPG.

238
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:32,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a spoof of Skyrim, stuff like that.

239
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:40,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can side with the king or you can side with the monsters and actually try to take over the kingdom and stuff.

240
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:44,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a funny art style that kind of reminds me of Job Simulator or something like that.

241
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it looked kind of cool.

242
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:48,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I forgot to ask what that game was.

243
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really cute.

244
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,167
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wasn't.

245
00:23:54,427 --> 00:24:12,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a headache.

246
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:15,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I fell back down the Final Fantasy XI rabbit hole hard last week.

247
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:23,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks to Retro Achievements, I learned about this private Final Fantasy XI thing called Horizon.

248
00:24:24,218 --> 00:24:30,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't feel bad playing on a private server because I still pay Square Enix every month and I bought Final Fantasy XI twice.

249
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:31,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk to the wall.

250
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:47,295
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that stuff.

251
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't even have Otter gone.

252
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:53,186
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't even be a Blue Mage or a Corsair or whatever else they added in that one.

253
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:57,593
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only limited to the first couple expansions and level 75.

254
00:24:58,134 --> 00:25:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: But the interesting thing is the client still has some...

255
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:04,905
[SPEAKER_03]: of the modern quality of life things, but not a lot.

256
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:07,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It does level sync, which is huge for the game.

257
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:13,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have level sync, but that's the only thing as opposed to, you know, like there's no book burning.

258
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have to do dunes parties and things like that.

259
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,747
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but it's like, I feel like this, it's scratching a nostalgia bone for me hard.

260
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:26,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, y'all know how long, how much we used to play fucking Final Fantasy XI back in the day.

261
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:31,440
[SPEAKER_03]: But like already in the scope of what, a week and a half that I've been playing this,

262
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:38,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a level 22 Red Mage with a level 10... I need to work on a level 10 White Mage subjob.

263
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:39,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So I finished the subjob class.

264
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:45,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the run to Juno this morning and got my Chocobo because that's another thing they sped up.

265
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:46,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to wait.

266
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:48,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You used to have to do the Chocobo quest.

267
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take you like six hours because you had to wait an in-game day.

268
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:55,248
[SPEAKER_03]: They compressed it so that every in-game hour you can feed the Chocobo.

269
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:56,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes by a lot faster.

270
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it done in 30 minutes.

271
00:25:57,752 --> 00:25:58,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

272
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:01,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

273
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:04,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, it's been interesting.

274
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I was able to get to Juno and talk to the thing that unlocks more of my retro achievements for leveling and stuff.

275
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can actually see the little progress I'm making.

276
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:21,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm doing it for achievements, because now it's just like scratching this nostalgia bone where I'm like, God, playing in parties was actually really fun.

277
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:23,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just...

278
00:26:23,007 --> 00:26:26,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The modern MMOs don't have the same feel to it.

279
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slower, but that was part of the charm of it.

280
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:33,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing things like magic bursts and skill chains and all that shit.

281
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And Horizon, for the most part, embraces add-ons.

282
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:43,272
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some that are on their ban list, but their client has a bunch pre-installed if you want to use them.

283
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:46,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of them will tell you what skill chains to do.

284
00:26:46,316 --> 00:26:46,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.

285
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:48,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to memorize everything.

286
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:53,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I think for all those reasons, it's moving a little faster than it did when I first played the game.

287
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but yeah, just enjoying it.

288
00:26:55,726 --> 00:27:03,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am recognizing like, wow, I'm like playing nothing else because I'm too much in this nostalgia hole right now.

289
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:07,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes, sometimes you just want to eat comfort food.

290
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:12,162
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're going to eat pizza and ice cream every day for a week until you get sick of it.

291
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:16,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go, oh, I should stop eating this.

292
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:16,707
Yeah.

293
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:20,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I'm surprised you haven't tried and fallen down that hole yet.

294
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:21,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really surprised.

295
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:22,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what you would do.

296
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:23,651
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I haven't tried.

297
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,597
[SPEAKER_03]: You have 11 more than anyone, so all right.

298
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:27,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded 11 again the other day.

299
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:28,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

300
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just have...

301
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:58,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you'd have to do differently because I bought it a long time ago back on like was it the Amazon game store or something like that so I still have like an installation like a key that's still valid Horizon's a whole separate thing and it doesn't use play online so they have a whole separate installer and the game client is so it's an all-in-one pack you don't have to do anything special you just download it and there it is so yeah it's kind of nice so but again I probably shouldn't be enabling you

302
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but that is my gaming week.

303
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:03,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I should get back to, I still want to beat fantasy life.

304
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:14,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have games on the switch to play, but you know, you know, some, sometimes after a long day at work, you just want to join a Valcrum Dunes party and skill chain lizards for three hours.

305
00:28:14,841 --> 00:28:15,622
[SPEAKER_03]: What, just what you want to do.

306
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:17,004
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

307
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,026
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want to do?

308
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:18,807
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

309
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:20,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm, and Pallia.

310
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:24,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's kind of a comfort food sort of game, too.

311
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that, because I play Pallia now.

312
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:27,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's my cozy vibe.

313
00:28:27,688 --> 00:28:28,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's cozy vibe.

314
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:37,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, the only thing that's not cozy vibe about Final Fantasy XI, running away from goblin tinkers that you accidentally aggroed, because that's also still a thing.

315
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You still gotta zone the goblins.

316
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:40,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

317
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,839
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do that because in the old XI, they used to run back and they would attack all the other parties as they're running back.

318
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,382
[SPEAKER_03]: But now once they get zoned, they fade.

319
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:51,844
[SPEAKER_03]: They fade away and they don't run back.

320
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of nice.

321
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:56,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't grief parties or anything like that.

322
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They changed that.

323
00:28:58,973 --> 00:29:01,657
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not long into the game that they changed that.

324
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:04,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say they changed that with the Treasures of Ottergon expansion or something.

325
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:05,922
Yeah.

326
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:09,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's talk about more going on in gaming news.

327
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:15,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Nintendo, a lot out of their camp this week yet again going into the holidays, right, Loki?

328
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they did their Nintendo Indie World Showcase.

329
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:25,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're announcing a bunch of different indie games that are coming out on the different Switch platforms and stuff.

330
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these we've heard of before.

331
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:28,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these were new.

332
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:32,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of just we'll go over these really quickly.

333
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the stuff that's a little more familiar.

334
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:40,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had Mina the Hollow Word, which of course is from the Shovel Knight folks.

335
00:29:41,103 --> 00:30:03,313
[SPEAKER_06]: and they showed off a new uh gameplay trailer and also that now so that demo is available for that uh there's uh Well Dweller which looks pretty cool it's kind of a dark fantasy metroidvania game that's coming out next year uh Neverway which is like a it almost reminds me of a um

336
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't Starve type game.

337
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,655
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a nightmarish life sim or something like that.

338
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:11,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

339
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:15,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's supposed to be coming out next year as well.

340
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurtling, I think I've seen a trailer for this before.

341
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:27,006
[SPEAKER_06]: The folks behind Firewatch, that's coming out in about a week or two on the 21st.

342
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:50,428
[SPEAKER_06]: is this seat taken that's a cool puzzle game that was released that day they announced a new update for big kitty uh little kitty big city and they're going to be getting this uh a perfect picture update that's also going to have new areas new friends that you can meet new skills and uh of course a camera mode because

343
00:30:50,408 --> 00:31:14,560
[SPEAKER_06]: why the game didn't have a photo mode with cats that's what we use the internet for anyways um so yeah and that's coming out later this year that free content update uh speaking of content content warning is going to be coming to the Switch and Switch 2 as well sometime next year um Ball X Pit or Ball Pit from Devolver Digital looked pretty awesome it's kind of like a

344
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Roguelike with Arkanoid style gameplay.

345
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:21,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can now pay to spend extra time in the ball pit.

346
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:23,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can.

347
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:24,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray.

348
00:31:24,888 --> 00:31:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's launching on the Switch October 15th and on the Switch 2 sometime later.

349
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:34,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, which is the sequel to Ultimate Chicken Horse.

350
00:31:34,986 --> 00:31:39,534
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a racing platformer game instead of the traditional one.

351
00:31:39,935 --> 00:31:44,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be coming out a little bit later this year, I think.

352
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:46,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Glaciered

353
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:54,479
[SPEAKER_06]: is a, it almost looks like a Subnautica type thing, but it's a RPG with aquatic monsters.

354
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be coming out this holiday on Switch 2.

355
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:02,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they showed off just some quick trailers as well.

356
00:32:03,293 --> 00:32:12,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a trailer for Winter Burrow, which is a kind of a cool looking survival game where you play a mouse living in the snow.

357
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:13,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was kind of neat.

358
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:24,132
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Undusted Letters from the Past, Tiny Bookshop, Caves of... I have no idea how to pronounce that.

359
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:24,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Cud?

360
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:25,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

361
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:27,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Q-U-D?

362
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:27,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Coode?

363
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:29,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

364
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:33,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Strange Antiquities, Opus, Prism Peak, Go!

365
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Go!

366
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Town, UFO 50, which is awesome.

367
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That actually was launching that day as well.

368
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,223
[SPEAKER_06]: UFO 50 is a great game.

369
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:45,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Demon's School and Go!

370
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:45,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Go!

371
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:46,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Town.

372
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:49,746
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, lots of indie games we're checking out.

373
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:59,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see Nintendo sort of dedicate a little time because I think sometimes, at least with the original Switch shop, it really felt overloaded and burdened.

374
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess this is true to some extent with the Switch 2 shop too.

375
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,467
[SPEAKER_03]: We know there's a bunch of shovelware on there.

376
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:05,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We know where there is.

377
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:11,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice of Nintendo to spend some of their official time really highlighting some things that are kind of worth a second look that can get lost.

378
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:16,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of wish they did these maybe once a month and a little more often.

379
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:19,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I guess maybe they seem to do them about once every other month.

380
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:21,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's not as bad as I'm thinking in my mind.

381
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:26,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice that they highlight those types of things because it's, you know, it's good.

382
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:32,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to some comments over in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network about some of the games in the pack.

383
00:33:32,307 --> 00:34:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says I admit most of these aren't really in my wheelhouse but I did notice UFO 50 so hope to pick that one up at some point Bobby Blackwolf also commenting on UFO 50 saying UFO 50 was the best announcement of the day and it was buried in a sizzle reel well that happens sometimes you know what what might not be a big deal to you is a big deal to someone else and then of course the whole infamous they spend too much time talking about this sports game I don't give a fuck about like that happens a lot too right so

384
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:01,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not in this thing.

385
00:34:02,903 --> 00:34:04,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not in the indie thing.

386
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:07,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, indie sports games tend to be the best ones.

387
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:16,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I will say, one of our local little bars did their gamer night this week, and some of my friends were playing Windjammer for like an hour.

388
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:21,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, although, is that really an indie?

389
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:22,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think it is.

390
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:27,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, another comment here from Seeger Starzik, who says...

391
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:54,508
[SPEAKER_03]: is this seat taken is pretty good picked it up that day and have had a really good time with it so far seems like it could be very short though yeah sometimes those indie games especially if they're low cost may be kind of cheaper so there's that all right well uh hopefully y'all saw at least one thing in that showcase that you liked uh meanwhile a lot of people telling Nintendo what they like or don't like about a certain system that they have set up with their

392
00:34:56,108 --> 00:35:18,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Game Keycards

393
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:22,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm going to assume that people really jumped on this.

394
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, because the whole game key card thing has garnered a lot of negative attention, like at least, you know, if the temperature on social media, on places like Blue Sky, Facebook, whatever TikToks to be believed, people don't really like this.

395
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:44,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure there were plenty of people that were jumping at the opportunity to give some feedback on this.

396
00:35:44,624 --> 00:36:12,184
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

397
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:21,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the questions that they were asking were, in general, when it comes to games for a Nintendo Switch system, do you prefer purchasing games in physical format or in digital formats?

398
00:36:21,984 --> 00:36:28,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And for which of the following reasons would you consider purchasing physical versions of Nintendo Switch games?

399
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you never fucking discount them?

400
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a valid response?

401
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like that actually is.

402
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Physical games tend to go on sale from the retailer and things like that.

403
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:46,043
[SPEAKER_03]: If nothing else, it shows that Nintendo is looking at this and is taking an interest in it.

404
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:55,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm left to believe they have to be hearing what people on the internet are saying even if they're not directly doing anything about it yet.

405
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:11,162
[SPEAKER_03]: and I doubt they will for quite some time because I'm sure they have people are saying things they don't like well but there is another thing that could be playing into this as well and that could be the fact that physical games versus digital games is going to get more complicated because of tariffs

406
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:17,551
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that stupidity that is now enacted is that it's going to make the cost of physical games more expensive.

407
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,175
[SPEAKER_03]: So digital game for that reason is going to be more alluring.

408
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:23,079
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's some advantage to maybe having that data as well.

409
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:38,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may be completely outside the discussion of the game key cards, which actually, I mean, again, in the wake of tariffs, those game key cards are even like 10 times worse because now it's like you're paying more for a game.

410
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: For what?

411
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,844
[SPEAKER_03]: for nothing.

412
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:48,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, I, I just, a lot is pretty screwy with all that system right now.

413
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we'll see what comes of it for sure.

414
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:59,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but no, no, obviously no word on what's going to be done with the survey results yet, but Nintendo has obviously made it very clear.

415
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,051
[SPEAKER_03]: They have enough data.

416
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:01,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

417
00:38:03,274 --> 00:38:03,475
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

418
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:04,015
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

419
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:04,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

420
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:05,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Drive through.

421
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:05,938
Yeah.

422
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:12,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something new from the Video Game History Foundation.

423
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they're not just looking at games.

424
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:18,994
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking at anything related to games.

425
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:26,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have got the rights to release a computer entertainer.

426
00:38:26,843 --> 00:38:31,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it started as a video game update, which was a newsletter for U.S.

427
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:34,851
[SPEAKER_02]: mail order retailer Video Takeout, which I had never heard of.

428
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:36,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we had one where I lived.

429
00:38:36,513 --> 00:39:02,487
[SPEAKER_02]: and it ran from 1982 to 1990 and it actually was co-edited by Mary Lou Badeau and Celeste Dolan and means it is also one of the earliest console video game magazines run by women and so every issue of it is available through the Video Game History Foundation That's cool

430
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:05,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's really neat.

431
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly I'm glad that they are looking at, you know, not just the games, but anything related to the culture, you know.

432
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:15,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

433
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very important piece of women's history as well.

434
00:39:20,707 --> 00:39:20,847
Mm-hmm.

435
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:32,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is important to also have that sort of like snapshot in time because, you know, just being able to kind of explain to people what gaming was like in a different era.

436
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:36,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes people don't really have that reference, you know, not to sound like the old man on the block, but it's true.

437
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:42,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people that didn't grow up on Atari 2600 don't have a sense of just how it was.

438
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's going to come a time when, you know, the gamers are like, oh, what was an instruction manual?

439
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:47,641
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

440
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:50,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go on the internet to find whatever you needed?

441
00:39:50,244 --> 00:39:50,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

442
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:57,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the art of the instruction manual is sadly going to be long gone, except for, I guess, niche collector's editions and things like that.

443
00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:05,591
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's definitely preserving a moment in time, which I think is really good.

444
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:08,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

445
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:08,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

446
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:11,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is all what we grew up with.

447
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:12,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

448
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

449
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:17,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I don't recall this particular magazine, so I'm excited to see more about it.

450
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:24,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you used to have to buy those magazines and we couldn't afford them all.

451
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:28,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool that we can sort of go back and revisit that now.

452
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

453
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:35,568
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTC in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, definitely appreciate their preservation efforts.

454
00:40:35,588 --> 00:40:36,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

455
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about games preservation, it needs to be all of it, right?

456
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:46,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster says, I was curious and took a look and I found a Dragon Stomper release in their January 83 issue.

457
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:48,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, January 83.

458
00:40:48,986 --> 00:40:49,547
[SPEAKER_03]: What a throwback.

459
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:50,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

460
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on, I guess, to more modern sensibilities.

461
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:55,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Loki?

462
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:56,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

463
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:58,840
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely...

464
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:11,268
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there comes a time that companies have to reflect upon their decisions and realize that maybe it wasn't the kids that are wrong.

465
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:14,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I was a bit wrong, but not too much.

466
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:16,715
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to take full responsibility, obviously.

467
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:24,405
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, this focus with a lot of companies focusing on live service games, Sony being one of those.

468
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:28,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Run into some hiccups, obviously, with some games like Concord and the like.

469
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically saying during a, you know, financial Q&A that, yeah, it's not going entirely smoothly.

470
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhat negative news has been coming out if we look at the past five years.

471
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:46,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years ago, live service games were almost non-existent from PlayStation Studios.

472
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:51,878
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Helldivers 2, MLB The Show, Gran Turismo 7, and Destiny's 2.

473
00:41:51,858 --> 00:42:07,588
[SPEAKER_06]: um so we have four live service or four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner but you know it's I think a little bit harder to get another like kind of

474
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:33,728
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

475
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:45,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, of course, we recognize there are still many issues, so we should learn the lessons from our mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content where there's less waste and it's more smooth.

476
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:50,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also something that people want because, you know, Concord sucked.

477
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:53,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and they are so nervous about Marathon.

478
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the early testing of Marathon, I don't think went super great.

479
00:42:58,123 --> 00:43:00,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's still a lot to be cooked with that game.

480
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:03,010
[SPEAKER_03]: But that game has so much writing on it right now.

481
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:13,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if the gaming population is in the same space that they were for a game like Marathon to be truly successful.

482
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:14,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

483
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:16,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry for that one.

484
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:21,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they focus more on the like, how are we going to monetize this?

485
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:27,850
[SPEAKER_06]: How is this going to be, you know, how are we going to profit from this versus making a good game?

486
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the problem with like Concord.

487
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,818
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem with Marathon.

488
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:33,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like,

489
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:53,968
[SPEAKER_06]: you take the live service part out of it if it was just hey here's a game we're going to release later this year and we're going to show it off to you in like a demo and the demo plays like garbage you're going to be like whoa hold on I don't want to purchase this and so that's the thing it's like it doesn't you can take the live service out of the equation stop putting out unfinished games

490
00:43:53,948 --> 00:44:07,789
[SPEAKER_06]: from anybody that goes to a lot of different companies stop putting out unfinished games and then when you do decide to not listen to the audience and do it anyways don't be surprised when it bites you in the ass

491
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:14,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I think gamers are also just becoming a lot more aware that like video games are, you know, PlayStation 5 games are $70.

492
00:44:15,024 --> 00:44:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to come out with a game that asks you for more money on top of that.

493
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:26,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think gamers are becoming more and more aware, like it's going to take a really special kind of game for me to plunk down that kind of money.

494
00:44:26,695 --> 00:44:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to either, you know, have a story that really fucking moves me or like a player versus player type of mode that really entices me to come back over and over and over again.

495
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:58,532
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's just a riskier and riskier thing to do you know when games were $50 you know I think people are just becoming more and more aware especially and then versus of course the free to play games because I think the biggest competitor for a game like Marathon ends up being Fortnite because at the end of the day Fortnite is still free to put on your PlayStation and is a shooty bang bang game

496
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:14,293
[SPEAKER_03]: so you have to give people that premium experience especially I would argue in a single player mode that that $70 is going to justify but I worry that especially in that single player mode it's not going to be there

497
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:26,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Questbuster in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, Sony's efforts gave me the impression that they thought they couldn't fail by doing things like buying Bungie without realizing the luck part of success.

498
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:30,909
[SPEAKER_03]: No one expected Helldivers 2 to explode the way it did, but there you are.

499
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:36,957
[SPEAKER_03]: While Concord, which was created to bring that kind of success home, utterly collapsed.

500
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And how's Overwatch 2 doing these days in that space?

501
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:45,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I feel like the team shooters in general are sort of declining.

502
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:46,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

503
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:50,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Marvel Rivals is still kind of holding its own, especially with such a recognizable IP.

504
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:51,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know, y'all.

505
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:53,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just...

506
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:57,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Marathon's a different kind of game, but I am worried.

507
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to be proven wrong.

508
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:02,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do hope they take the time to get it right.

509
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:09,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also know the budget to make a game like this isn't limitless.

510
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:16,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And the longer it goes on, the more they're going to feel the need to nickel and dime the players to try to make the money back.

511
00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:16,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

512
00:46:18,027 --> 00:46:22,775
[SPEAKER_03]: SD100 Matt in chat says, I sadly haven't gone back to Overwatch 2 since Marvel Rivals came out.

513
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:23,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's just you.

514
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:25,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think it's just you.

515
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, moving on.

516
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:34,395
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very interesting patent that Nintendo has put out there.

517
00:46:34,415 --> 00:46:36,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for a crank.

518
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:58,142
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

519
00:46:58,257 --> 00:47:05,410
[SPEAKER_03]: and perhaps the crank could be used in something like, I don't know, Animal Crossing when people go fishing or something.

520
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's some Dreamcast games they could bring back with this.

521
00:47:08,114 --> 00:47:08,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

522
00:47:09,497 --> 00:47:15,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the interesting thing about a crank, maybe try to lure some ports of Playdate games.

523
00:47:15,888 --> 00:47:19,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, the Playdate is a very different type of system.

524
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:22,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't run things on the same level.

525
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:28,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think they considered Playdate to be any sort of competition whatsoever.

526
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:36,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so either, but certainly, you know, like, hey, we have the ability to put this game on our store too.

527
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:36,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

528
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:44,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the Playdate is as serious of a thing as it is, you know, some type of just new control accessory or maybe inspired by the Playdate.

529
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:50,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, what if we took that crank idea the Playdate has and put it on the Nintendo console?

530
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:50,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

531
00:47:50,553 --> 00:47:53,519
[SPEAKER_06]: What if we patent it and then we sue them for using the crank?

532
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're evil.

533
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:55,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope not.

534
00:47:55,603 --> 00:48:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the patent is for the Switch 2 and the way it interfaces with the Switch 2 controller specifically.

535
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:05,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you know, I don't put anything past Nintendo, unfortunately.

536
00:48:05,684 --> 00:48:06,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.

537
00:48:07,192 --> 00:48:08,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

538
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:16,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a reminder, there were a lot of wild accessories during the Wii because that Wiimote would click into a lot of things.

539
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The plastic steering wheel, hello.

540
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:21,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember there was a fishing rod for the Wii.

541
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that being a thing.

542
00:48:24,132 --> 00:48:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an official Mario Kart thing.

543
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:28,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That was day one for the Switch 2.

544
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:29,318
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

545
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:31,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

546
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:33,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see if anything comes to this.

547
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:38,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, just because it gets trademarked, it doesn't mean it's going to happen.

548
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:40,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But it might.

549
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on.

550
00:48:43,363 --> 00:48:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Some exciting stuff in retro news.

551
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:45,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, DarkSakura?

552
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:45,568
Yeah.

553
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:51,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, I had to swallow.

554
00:48:53,282 --> 00:49:07,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So for fans of Evercade, there is a new release coming out, which is the Rare Collection 1 and a ZX Spectrum set.

555
00:49:07,983 --> 00:49:08,704
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

556
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:11,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually looking pretty good.

557
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually says it's the debut of ZX Spectrum emulation on Evercade.

558
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:30,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is also going to include some of the early NES games, Cobra Triangle, RC Pro-Am, and Battletoads, and the arcade version of Battletoads, and then Conker's Pocket Tales from Game Boy Color.

559
00:49:31,504 --> 00:49:32,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

560
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

561
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I want to pick up one of those rare cartridges.

562
00:49:39,127 --> 00:49:43,495
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, cool.

563
00:49:45,038 --> 00:50:02,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

564
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:04,614
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

565
00:50:05,395 --> 00:50:10,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got good news that Digital Foundry is now going to be going independent.

566
00:50:10,202 --> 00:50:19,416
[SPEAKER_06]: They've decided to leave IGN and have, I think, purchased back their company to be able to actually take it independent.

567
00:50:19,497 --> 00:50:28,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, if you're not familiar with Digital Foundry, they do a lot of these different kind of evaluations of games and see how well the visuals and everything run.

568
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: and like you'll even look at like frame timings and stuff like that it's where you get a lot of this news about oh yeah this Switch game was it was basically a postage stamp that they're upscaling to 1080p you know that type of stuff but it is exciting to see you know them out from underneath IGN and yeah so they announced that to everybody on their podcast and going forward they're going to be operating independently so that's

569
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:58,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty awesome.

570
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:04,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the first company in the media space to go independent.

571
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's been quite a few this year.

572
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a little bit of a theme.

573
00:51:07,204 --> 00:51:08,347
[SPEAKER_03]: So congrats.

574
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:09,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

575
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:13,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's almost always good news for these companies in these situations.

576
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

577
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:31,956
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

578
00:51:31,936 --> 00:51:50,147
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

579
00:51:50,127 --> 00:51:50,628
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

580
00:51:50,729 --> 00:51:52,614
[SPEAKER_03]: A new trailer was released this week.

581
00:51:52,634 --> 00:51:54,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't know all the details.

582
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: We just know what's in the trailer.

583
00:51:56,344 --> 00:52:01,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was also, I guess, a cannibalism update that was done.

584
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we talked about that on a prior episode.

585
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:05,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was last week, I think.

586
00:52:05,129 --> 00:52:32,537
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

587
00:52:32,517 --> 00:52:34,021
[SPEAKER_06]: that you have to avoid.

588
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:49,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the game has, for example, a jungle with rain that makes the surfaces slippery, the snow that has cold air or wind that you have to avoid and otherwise you freeze to death, the lava one that

589
00:52:49,662 --> 00:53:11,063
[SPEAKER_03]: you know don't fall into lava where the mountains will burst in the fire and that type of stuff so yeah it's it'll be interesting glad to see that they're still supporting it now for those of you that like to do your quests on discord because that's a thing now you play certain games you get little limited time things or little currency to buy you know flair on discord or what have you

590
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:16,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Peak will be having a limited time exclusive quest in Discord or with Discord.

591
00:53:16,848 --> 00:53:18,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be live just for next week.

592
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So between August 11th and August 17th.

593
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get a Bing Bong avatar for that.

594
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:23,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Bing Bong.

595
00:53:24,976 --> 00:53:27,458
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's what the little characters are called in that game.

596
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:31,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Also new achievements apparently are coming as well.

597
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:33,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is all happening tomorrow.

598
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So please look forward to it.

599
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:41,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I thought this is not directly related to the expansion, but I thought this was interesting.

600
00:53:41,030 --> 00:54:05,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Death by Daylight Death by Daylight

601
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:12,157
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the most important Roblox game that is an original, at least as far as I know, is the fashion dress up game.

602
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:13,639
[SPEAKER_03]: God, why can't I remember the name of that game?

603
00:54:13,659 --> 00:54:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much.

604
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's so good.

605
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:16,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that.

606
00:54:17,062 --> 00:54:18,524
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Grow a Garden.

607
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: There's but there's knockoffs of other games all the time.

608
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:25,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know I've seen the Dead by Daylight one, you know, so much.

609
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:26,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

610
00:54:26,172 --> 00:54:34,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, there is a peak as in the game we were just talking about a copy on Roblox.

611
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:35,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even a knockoff.

612
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:40,795
[SPEAKER_06]: They've ripped off full... The assets look the same.

613
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just straight up ripping it off.

614
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:53,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, on the official X account, because unfortunately some companies still use X and support its current owner, but I realize there's a lot of companies doing it, so it is what it is.

615
00:54:53,912 --> 00:55:08,175
[SPEAKER_03]: AgroCrab Games put out a very interesting post on X saying, TBH would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff.

616
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:31,834
[SPEAKER_03]: so we're hearing that word slop a lot with AI related things in this day and age but now it's being thrown at this too like Roblox knockoffs being slop which I mean I could see that they kind of are I am like honestly so surprised that they haven't cracked that copyright holders haven't cracked down on Roblox like yeah

617
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:59,172
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like the largest gaming platform right now and there is so much rampant copyright theft just so much some of it is unintentional because it's kids making the game but that said, there's a lot of it that is adults making these games full well understanding that yeah, I'm ripping off the copyright for this so it's unfortunate

618
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:08,609
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently Cliff in the screenshot that was shared on social media already had 160,000 visits.

619
00:56:08,629 --> 00:56:10,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like this is some underground thing.

620
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:13,357
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already very much out there.

621
00:56:13,978 --> 00:56:19,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting point also made along these same lines about slop and AI.

622
00:56:19,908 --> 00:56:48,531
[SPEAKER_03]: and I know this we talked about this a couple weeks ago the PlayStation store AI generated bullshit that is meant to cash in on different trends in gaming right now so that's another you know place so yeah I I feel like this is all gonna come to an apex legally at some point so we'll see interesting interesting uh and a lot of folks comment giving the sorry a lot of folks in chat giving the appropriate comment here which is oof

623
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that would be the appropriate comment to this story.

624
00:56:55,316 --> 00:56:58,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to our next segment and take a trip down memory lane, shall we?

625
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:17,362
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

626
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:20,166
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

627
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:21,127
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

628
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:30,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And once a month, DarkSakura puts a little twist on things and she picks a game that for 2025, it is a classic.

629
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,265
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a game and now it's in the arcade.

630
00:57:33,525 --> 00:57:36,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is the classic game to arcade of the month, DarkSakura?

631
00:57:37,668 --> 00:57:40,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's been in the arcade for a hot minute.

632
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:46,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game is Injustice Gods Among Us.

633
00:57:48,743 --> 00:57:55,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this segment doesn't necessarily have to encompass the 10-year limit, you know what I mean?

634
00:57:56,694 --> 00:58:01,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Injustice does fall in the 10-year limit since the game came out in 2013.

635
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:07,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But in 2017, the arcade version came out.

636
00:58:07,773 --> 00:58:30,658
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh you uh I mean it's a full-on arcade port of wait why is this saying the mobile game yeah of the mobile game interesting I didn't realize that part but it was made by Raw Thrills working with NetherRealm Studio and it first came out in Dave and Buster's before a worldwide release so um

637
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

638
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:38,120
[SPEAKER_02]: This is weird because it says that you have cards.

639
00:58:39,202 --> 00:58:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you have cards that you scan for your character.

640
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:48,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it plays like the mobile version with the push and hold buttons.

641
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:49,897
[SPEAKER_02]: There's six buttons all together.

642
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:53,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have quick attack block and a strong attack.

643
00:58:53,282 --> 00:58:54,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have a special attack button.

644
00:58:54,904 --> 00:59:01,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, you have your start and buy a card without playing the game.

645
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:05,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also is your tag-in button during the battle.

646
00:59:05,866 --> 00:59:07,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't choose what attack you want to use.

647
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:15,613
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to use the special button to do your special, no matter how much your bar is filled up.

648
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:23,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like weird mini-game-ish sort of shenanigans going on.

649
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really weird.

650
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:30,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I had remembered that there was some catch to this game because I saw it and really didn't want to play it.

651
00:59:31,914 --> 00:59:32,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

652
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this is really the mobile version, just a lot more scaled.

653
00:59:43,223 --> 00:59:55,334
[SPEAKER_02]: The Series 4 update had an instant super move that you can use when the battle begins, and you do need an additional credit to use it, and it'll give you a bonus card with an additional reward.

654
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:59,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to basically spend twice as much on a single match.

655
00:59:59,778 --> 01:00:03,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely something to suck up money, is what it is.

656
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:18,152
[SPEAKER_02]: um as for um the game uh beneath uh actually where your character's name is a player uh the character's name

657
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:40,714
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

658
01:00:40,694 --> 01:00:57,555
[SPEAKER_02]: um you have many swapping games for different special attacks and you will always have a countdown um and then you have a single player ladder a medium ladder and a hard ladder um and then of course there's a

659
01:00:58,514 --> 01:01:04,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cards will also be different outfits for some of the characters.

660
01:01:04,522 --> 01:01:08,808
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the same character just with different outfits.

661
01:01:08,848 --> 01:01:12,512
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different power levels.

662
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:19,562
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in the Silver set, if you had Bane, there's a Nightfall and then there's a Regime version.

663
01:01:20,102 --> 01:01:23,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nightfall has 65 power levels.

664
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:26,031
[SPEAKER_02]: and 81 Defense.

665
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:30,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Regime one has 63 power and 73 defense, so it's a little bit different.

666
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it has higher speed than the Nightfall one.

667
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:35,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's different trade-offs and everything.

668
01:01:35,064 --> 01:01:36,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems pretty balanced.

669
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You get all kinds of different versions of the characters that way in different outfits.

670
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:43,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

671
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:50,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The cards themselves, of course, have different stats.

672
01:01:50,192 --> 01:01:54,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for the odds of pulling a card.

673
01:01:54,558 --> 01:02:04,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So for bronze, it's 20%, silver 26%, gold 46%, which is pretty good because the gold I think is the one that's got like Batman and all of that on there.

674
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:05,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

675
01:02:06,892 --> 01:02:20,450
[SPEAKER_02]: The team cards are 3%, boss cards are 2.5%, gear is 2.5%, and the foil cards are 33% overall split between bronze, silver, gold, team, and boss and gear.

676
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:25,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, yeah.

677
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:30,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, this is a game that's definitely designed to suck up money.

678
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:32,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I just say play at home.

679
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:44,425
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.

680
01:02:44,759 --> 01:03:06,160
[SPEAKER_02]: that's more like the Dragon Ball Z game where you actually have your own character in the universe who goes on the different adventures trying to fix weird universal stuff but it's a lot more of an adventure game and I think a little bit less of a money sink yeah

681
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a lot more involved.

682
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:15,442
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just fighting where that one is, I think, fighting and adventure and full story and everything.

683
01:03:15,682 --> 01:03:17,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And this looks like a mobile game.

684
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:18,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

685
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:20,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw this not that long ago.

686
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:21,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one of these at Roseville Golf Land.

687
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:24,834
[SPEAKER_03]: My work had a thingy thing at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.

688
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, it's an Injustice game.

689
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:27,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And it uses cards.

690
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I thought, oh, the cards look like they might be neat.

691
01:03:29,499 --> 01:03:31,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I looked at the price and I was like, hmm.

692
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,524
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game looked bad.

693
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:35,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they had it when we all went there before.

694
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:36,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

695
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:36,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

696
01:03:36,937 --> 01:03:38,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true, true.

697
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:43,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if, I mean, Roosevelt Golf Land with money gobblers.

698
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:43,791
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

699
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

700
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:46,035
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

701
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:46,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Never gasp.

702
01:03:47,277 --> 01:03:48,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp, I say gasp.

703
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:55,634
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, your classic game to arcade, because not all of them are upgrades necessarily, of the month.

704
01:03:56,175 --> 01:03:57,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Injustice.

705
01:03:57,845 --> 01:03:58,186
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

706
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:01,974
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, we have some more things to get into.

707
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:03,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

708
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we wrap up tonight, we have some rapid fire news, some quick headlines to talk about here.

709
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:11,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go over to Loki with some rapid fire news.

710
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:31,378
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't forget the other Ubisoft project on Apple TV, Mythic Quest.

712
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously having several successful seasons of that series, it only makes sense that they would want to have him adapt one of their actual properties instead of just coming up with something brand new.

713
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:56,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, of course, they're also going to feature Noah Hawley of Fargo, that series.

714
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:25,918
[SPEAKER_06]: and apparently the collaboration they said is an embarrassment of riches because Far Cry you know they feel that it will let itself well to TV and yeah so interesting to see and it's apparently supposed to be on FX is where they're targeting that I don't know we'll see I'll be interested to check it out I do like some Far Cry early Far Cry so much newer stuff but

715
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:46,573
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also really cool and kind of unexpected we got an announcement that Heretic and Hexen have been updated and then of course re-released now as part yep as part of this was a QuakeCon 2025 announcement finally so finally yep so um

716
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:57,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're basically getting the full treatment, being updated and remastered for modern consoles and Steam.

717
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:02,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, along with that, they even have more campaigns as well.

718
01:06:02,268 --> 01:06:05,011
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, I think, a new campaign for both games.

719
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have, of course, online cross-platform deathmatch co-op for up to 16 players, split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 8 players.

720
01:06:13,884 --> 01:06:14,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

721
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:43,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Toggleable soundtrack, they have an enhanced soundtrack, plus you have the original soundtrack as well 4K, 120 FPS, lots of accessibility stuff added into the game as well Modern controller support, widescreen support, save load All the bells and whistles Yeah, that's pretty cool, and it's on Game Pass, so if you have Game Pass, you can just pick it up Yep I totally forgot that this came out, and I need to check it out

722
01:06:44,823 --> 01:07:02,562
[SPEAKER_03]: well ain't this something because it's already in my library oh apparently if you had an earlier version of it you got the upgrade for free I heard it was they've done this with Doom and stuff before like when they recently if you had bought Doom previously that you got the new one for free so maybe you uh

723
01:07:02,542 --> 01:07:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at all sad about this.

724
01:07:04,744 --> 01:07:05,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

725
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:17,717
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if you would ever have a scenario where you would need this, but they did include the original DOS versions of the game with the purchase of it as well.

726
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:22,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do pick up that collection on Steam or something like that, you still get the DOS versions.

727
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:23,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you have a DOS machine.

728
01:07:24,103 --> 01:07:26,646
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have an old DOS machine that you want to play it on, I guess.

729
01:07:26,926 --> 01:07:27,446
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

730
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:30,169
[SPEAKER_02]: DOS emulator for Mac.

731
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:32,231
[SPEAKER_06]: The DOS emulator for Mac.

732
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:34,654
[SPEAKER_02]: The irony is not lost.

733
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:41,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta get my config sys and auto exec set up and I'll be ready to game soon.

734
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:43,805
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as I figure out how to allocate all that RAM.

735
01:07:44,446 --> 01:07:46,988
[SPEAKER_06]: All that 4 megabytes of RAM.

736
01:07:47,049 --> 01:07:48,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't actually know what this is.

737
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:52,114
[SPEAKER_06]: This may have been 8 or 16 megabytes at the time.

738
01:07:52,975 --> 01:07:56,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Of it misreading the RAM and just going fast.

739
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the game's already done.

740
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:58,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

741
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:05,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Right and Chat says, check my GOG library.

742
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the new remaster.

743
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:10,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know those attention whores were not going to be left out.

744
01:08:10,272 --> 01:08:13,538
[SPEAKER_03]: As I've called them last week, girl, oh girl, they're not going to miss that boat.

745
01:08:14,661 --> 01:08:16,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl, oh girl, get on that trend.

746
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:33,822
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

747
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:49,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one of my personal heroes, Hip Tanaka, also real name Tanaka Hirokazu, is interested in doing video game soundtracks again.

748
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the absolute legends of chiptune music.

749
01:08:54,693 --> 01:09:01,480
[SPEAKER_02]: started with Nintendo in 1980 as an in-house composer during the 8-bit and 16-bit era.

750
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually helped design and program the audio hardware for the Famicom slash NES and the Game Boy.

751
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:16,695
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also done the soundtracks for Super Mario Land, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Balloon Fight, Dr. Mario, the Game Boy version of Tetris.

752
01:09:17,055 --> 01:09:24,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Co-composed the soundtracks for Mother and for Mother 2 or Earthbound with Suzuki Keiichi.

753
01:09:24,663 --> 01:09:38,074
[SPEAKER_02]: and he wrote songs for the Pokemon anime and Nintendo said he wasn't allowed to do it anymore because it said he was working for another company so he resigned from Nintendo and worked with Creatures Inc.

754
01:09:38,094 --> 01:09:40,900
[SPEAKER_02]: instead and now he was the president of the company.

755
01:09:41,318 --> 01:09:44,122
[SPEAKER_02]: But now he's wanting to get back into game music.

756
01:09:44,503 --> 01:09:45,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's cool.

757
01:09:48,308 --> 01:09:54,537
[SPEAKER_02]: He made a soundtrack for a game called Oasis from a studio called 17-Bit.

758
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:56,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have to find that.

759
01:09:57,642 --> 01:09:59,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But, oh, it looks cute.

760
01:10:01,127 --> 01:10:03,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, yeah, he's ready to go.

761
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:06,719
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

762
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:30,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited to see what he comes up with.

763
01:10:30,053 --> 01:10:50,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo 4, Diablo 2 Remaster Diablo 3, Diablo 4 Remaster

764
01:10:50,759 --> 01:10:52,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Immortal, for better or worse, was under his launch.

765
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:55,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's done a lot with driving the Diablo franchise.

766
01:10:56,468 --> 01:11:07,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But he says, after five years driving the Diablo franchise with four big launches, it's time to step away from Blizzard and Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next.

767
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:11,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm proud of what we've built and excited of what's ahead for Diablo and for me.

768
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:17,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was his post over on Blue Sky at rodferguson.bsky.

769
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

770
01:11:19,383 --> 01:11:19,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

771
01:11:19,463 --> 01:11:23,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Also of note, this comes right after a bunch of layoffs were done by Microsoft.

772
01:11:24,111 --> 01:11:28,678
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not technically part of the layoffs, but interesting.

773
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil Spencer did reply and said you brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming's most iconic franchises.

774
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:38,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Diablo 4 with you was a blast.

775
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:41,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.

776
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will see where he pops up next.

777
01:11:44,928 --> 01:11:48,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

778
01:11:48,462 --> 01:11:52,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt there's a new Diablo game coming out this week, but maybe there is something else you want to check out.

779
01:11:52,718 --> 01:11:54,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go to the US, Loki.

780
01:11:54,284 --> 01:11:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: What's coming out?

781
01:11:55,795 --> 01:12:03,846
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a whole lot this week, but we've got Ra Ra Boom on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

782
01:12:05,028 --> 01:12:08,433
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Senua's Saga Hellblade 2 on PlayStation 5.

01:12:59,144 --> 01:12:59,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna play off.

789
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:02,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on, but off.

790
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:02,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on, but off.

791
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:03,889
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

792
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Bug off.

793
01:13:06,412 --> 01:13:25,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's quickly, I wanted to mention before I go to Japanese releases, QuestBuster in chat made a comment about the Rod Ferguson bit that I thought was a really interesting prediction saying, there's speculation from some corners that Ferguson might go over to help Bioshock 4 after its recent shakeup given what he's done before.

794
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:27,514
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very...

795
01:13:27,494 --> 01:13:28,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

796
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:35,244
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to bring out the wheel of plausibility for that one because I would rank that high on the wheel of plausibility, to be honest.

797
01:13:35,284 --> 01:13:37,126
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good guess.

798
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for bringing that one to my attention, Quest Buster.

799
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:43,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's go to Japan and check out the releases in Japan.

800
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:50,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I will say on the PlayStation 5 and the Switch 2, it seems to be very quiet in Japan this week.

801
01:13:50,162 --> 01:13:51,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what the reason for that is.

802
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the only releases I have are on the 21st.

803
01:13:55,709 --> 01:14:00,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a quiet week in Japan for releases for whatever reason.

804
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything like on PlayStation 4?

805
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:03,598
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

806
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:04,640
[SPEAKER_03]: No games coming out this week.

807
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:04,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

808
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Golden Week.

809
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:07,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when that is now.

810
01:14:07,103 --> 01:14:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: After all these years, I figured that out.

811
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:09,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that.

812
01:14:09,405 --> 01:14:11,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... It's April and May.

813
01:14:11,128 --> 01:14:12,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not a big release week.

814
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:13,390
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

815
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:15,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we'll go to Europe, DarkSakura.

816
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually double-checking holidays for August.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a comment in chat about, could it be back to school week in Japan?

823
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:41,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was my initial thought, but it turns out, yeah, Japan's on it.

824
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,235
[SPEAKER_03]: The culture in Japan is more spring-oriented for school starts.

825
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is Mountain Day, but that's it.

826
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:47,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

827
01:15:47,303 --> 01:16:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

828
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:10,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I am one of those people that loves pretty much anything dropout, but Game Changer especially.

829
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:12,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Big fan of Sam Reich.

830
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:32,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sam Reich sat down for an interview with Kotaku talking about Game Changer and their seventh season, but one of the topics that got brought up was because they've been starting to implement video games into some of their challenges that they do on Game Changer that

831
01:16:32,765 --> 01:16:38,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, hey, would you like to just adapt one of your dropout properties into a game?

832
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:39,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, yeah, for sure.

833
01:16:40,373 --> 01:16:53,848
[SPEAKER_06]: The, I think, issue, and like most things with dropout, because it is a small independent company making all this stuff, it's just a matter of the time it would take to do all that and the resources it would take to do all that.

834
01:16:53,868 --> 01:16:57,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of what Sam is saying here, basically, that...

835
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:57,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.

836
01:16:57,954 --> 01:17:01,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we would be into that.

837
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about it.

838
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:12,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's like at this point, it's honestly more than anything just the bandwidth issue, which is if we're going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it.

839
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:14,796
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're not going to farm out the IP to some third party.

840
01:17:14,816 --> 01:17:22,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We want it to feel personal and it needs to be something therefore that we're excited about that feels different enough from what's out there and feels worth our time.

841
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:36,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And that basically the two series that Sam at least envisions that could possibly be converted into a game would be Dimension 20 and of course Game Changer.

842
01:17:36,879 --> 01:17:41,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I could absolutely see Dimension 20 since it's rooted in kind of

843
01:17:41,564 --> 01:18:11,233
[SPEAKER_06]: High Fantasy Dungeons and Dragons type stuff so there's a lot you could do there with that but yeah I'd be excited to see that and they had some of the previous stuff with Game Changer they've done simple things like a maze game that they had and then a ski free clone that they featured in that as well so it's it'd be interesting to see if they did something with that interesting alright

844
01:18:12,412 --> 01:18:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was our last... I now have the weenus running through my head.

845
01:18:18,438 --> 01:18:19,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Nick!

846
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, like, you know, the dropout is just great.

847
01:18:23,584 --> 01:18:25,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go subscribe.

848
01:18:25,866 --> 01:18:29,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I only see the little clips that come through on TikTok, but it seems pretty humorous.

849
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:31,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $7 a month.

850
01:18:31,612 --> 01:18:35,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like the, you know, Game Changer is a really fun series.

851
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:36,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Twitch site.

852
01:18:36,477 --> 01:18:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Dimension 20, you know, uh...

853
01:18:39,817 --> 01:18:42,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Dimension 20 is just absolutely worth it.

854
01:18:42,286 --> 01:18:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just anywhere where Burnley Mulligan is going to be.

855
01:18:45,157 --> 01:18:48,510
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, absolutely worth checking out.

856
01:18:49,132 --> 01:18:49,553
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

857
01:18:50,974 --> 01:18:52,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That is our last slotted story for tonight.

858
01:18:53,177 --> 01:18:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have some time for some last minute stories.

859
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like to check in with the mailbag as well.

860
01:18:57,422 --> 01:18:59,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I saw anything in there, but you never know.

861
01:18:59,425 --> 01:19:00,386
[SPEAKER_02]: We ain't got shit.

862
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:00,907
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

863
01:19:01,087 --> 01:19:06,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want to add shit, participate at Orangelandradar.com is the place where you can send us an email.

864
01:19:06,434 --> 01:19:07,695
[SPEAKER_02]: There was already shit in there.

865
01:19:07,715 --> 01:19:08,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleaned it out.

866
01:19:08,516 --> 01:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, all the fucking spam.

867
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:11,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Annoyed.

868
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Annoyed.

869
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:16,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I was checking the blue sky as well.

870
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,747
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really get any questions on blue sky, which you can follow us on blue sky.

871
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:22,310
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want at orange on trader.com, we use our domain as our blue sky handle.

872
01:19:22,651 --> 01:19:30,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I will shout out our buddies over at game buoy.org because they always are so nice to shout us out and leave us a little tag on social media.

873
01:19:30,618 --> 01:19:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to shout out our friends over at game buoy.org video game podcast, another show here at the voice geeks network.

874
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I'm going to be honest.

875
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:41,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't checked out their latest episode yet, but I know it just went up.

876
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:44,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be probably something I'll listen to on my drive up to Oregon.

877
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be fun.

878
01:19:46,112 --> 01:19:47,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

879
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:53,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, this is where we can open up for some calls.

880
01:19:53,839 --> 01:20:01,326
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to join our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, which I would encourage you to join anyway and talk with us throughout the week.

881
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:04,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also throw out some random questions in chat if you would like.

882
01:20:04,649 --> 01:20:06,651
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, I will check with Loki.

883
01:20:06,871 --> 01:20:08,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's a few stories that didn't make the cut tonight.

884
01:20:09,213 --> 01:20:11,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that game you were thinking of Dressed to Impress?

885
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dressed to Impress was the Roblox game I was trying to think of.

886
01:20:17,123 --> 01:20:18,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little teeny news.

887
01:20:18,946 --> 01:20:19,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what's that?

888
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:22,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a World of Warcraft thing.

889
01:20:23,893 --> 01:20:28,700
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a new patch and you can lean on a wall now.

890
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Wall leaning.

891
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:34,348
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look brooding and nonchalant.

892
01:20:34,368 --> 01:20:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: But they did also add new dungeons, a new raid, a new delve, new story stuff, new zone.

893
01:20:39,396 --> 01:20:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can lean against a wall now.

894
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:54,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see Sassy Pants do that, though.

895
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:56,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, my old character.

896
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

897
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:28,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play World of Warcraft not that long ago I checked out the most recent expansion it was fine I just I don't really have interest in the long term like the rating and all that stuff going on to be fair Final Fantasy 14 I haven't really cared about this most recent patch like I'm I'm really done with this expansion I just want them to move on to the next one which I guess this patch finishes the story of the current expansion I know but I I'm just gonna be honest I've been a fan of 14 for over a decade I just don't care about this story I'm done

898
01:21:28,803 --> 01:21:48,583
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

899
01:21:48,563 --> 01:21:50,165
[SPEAKER_03]: for, you know, especially that type of stuff.

900
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But also in Modern WoW, they really have added, I think because of 14, you know, they've added a lot to WoW that, you know, the UI is extremely customizable now.

901
01:21:59,557 --> 01:22:05,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the Delves, which are kind of like their solo or small party content that they have in the game.

902
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:06,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really interesting.

903
01:22:06,647 --> 01:22:10,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's plenty to do in Modern WoW.

904
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:36,728
[SPEAKER_03]: retail wow it's just it's weird to get caught up with it I mean you you level a character through like a new tutorial island and then like you do like one expansion worth of content you pick where Chromie sends you or you do the most recent expansion if you don't have Chromie sends you somewhere else um and then like you get into the newest expansion from there but it's just it's it's interesting how contained the expansions are now I don't know

905
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think they have to because they've moved the story so far ahead.

906
01:22:55,743 --> 01:23:00,490
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Joe and Hunter Matt says Rob, did you see or watch the new season of Wednesday?

907
01:23:00,951 --> 01:23:03,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see who was cast as Grandmama?

908
01:23:03,755 --> 01:23:07,420
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't, but was that where Joanna Lumley was supposed to be in it?

909
01:23:08,722 --> 01:23:10,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm wrong.

910
01:23:11,026 --> 01:23:12,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that who plays Grandmama?

911
01:23:12,328 --> 01:23:12,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yes.

912
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see it for that reason.

913
01:23:15,011 --> 01:23:17,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't had Netflix in years, actually.

914
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:18,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But I need to see it.

915
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:21,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard good things about Wednesday.

916
01:23:22,763 --> 01:23:25,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen the new season?

917
01:23:25,247 --> 01:23:25,547
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

918
01:23:25,662 --> 01:23:26,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I need to see it.

919
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:30,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't even watch the first season.

920
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

921
01:23:32,432 --> 01:23:34,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd watch the first season still.

922
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:36,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I've been spoiled on enough.

923
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:38,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I still need to watch Stranger Things Season 4.

924
01:23:39,121 --> 01:23:40,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to love that show.

925
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:40,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I still do.

926
01:23:41,084 --> 01:23:43,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you need to come over and watch Ghosts with me.

927
01:23:43,748 --> 01:23:44,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghosts?

928
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a good show.

929
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:49,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is that the comedy show on CBS?

930
01:23:49,136 --> 01:23:49,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

931
01:23:50,117 --> 01:23:50,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

932
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it!

933
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:57,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I watched the British one for a while, and then I actually kind of like the US one better, which is weird.

934
01:23:57,934 --> 01:24:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That I have, because I have Paramount+, that's all the CBS stuff.

935
01:24:01,502 --> 01:24:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have Ghost UK on there.

936
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:03,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it all on my Apple TV.

937
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:05,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

938
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:06,533
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so good!

939
01:24:06,573 --> 01:24:08,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, interesting.

940
01:24:08,913 --> 01:24:09,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check that out.

941
01:24:09,975 --> 01:24:12,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know me, I don't really watch shows.

942
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:12,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

943
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:14,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my problem.

944
01:24:14,023 --> 01:24:15,005
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very little I watch.

945
01:24:15,947 --> 01:24:19,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because I'm too busy sitting in dunes parties in Final Fantasy XI.

946
01:24:20,496 --> 01:24:25,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me run back to Loki and see if there's any last-minute stories we want to talk about.

947
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:28,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can talk about Battlefield 6's open beta.

948
01:24:28,869 --> 01:24:30,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been very successful.

949
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:39,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They had almost half a million players, nearly five times that of Battlefield 2042.

950
01:24:40,524 --> 01:24:47,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, along with those players, they also managed to swat away 300,000 of them that were cheating.

951
01:24:48,775 --> 01:24:49,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know.

952
01:24:51,623 --> 01:24:57,888
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, you know, it's good at least that they're catching cheaters now and they can adapt it for the final game.

953
01:24:57,908 --> 01:25:01,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, there'll be less cheaters in it, right, Larry?

954
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:02,632
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thought process at least.

955
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:03,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, cheaters.

956
01:25:03,773 --> 01:25:12,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we talked about Bioshock 4 and how there was some issues with it, you know, coming out in development.

957
01:25:12,061 --> 01:25:14,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, it has not been canceled.

958
01:25:14,863 --> 01:25:16,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is still in development.

959
01:25:16,885 --> 01:25:20,668
[SPEAKER_06]: But the clarification is that, you know, it is...

960
01:25:21,155 --> 01:25:49,542
[SPEAKER_06]: still having some trouble but they are working on getting that resolved so we shall see I hope so because I like Bioshock and I want a new one it's been too long it has alright well with that I think we're going to wrap up tonight's show DarkSakura I know you were on the fence about streaming tonight do you decide if you're going to do that or not I'm going to do it I said I would I'm just going to play some Mass Effect just you know maybe an hour or so cool

961
01:25:50,332 --> 01:25:52,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Might do Zaid's loyalty mission.

962
01:25:52,575 --> 01:25:55,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me do my typical spiel and then I'll turn it over to you for a final thought.

963
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:58,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

964
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:00,924
[SPEAKER_03]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.

965
01:26:00,944 --> 01:26:06,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

966
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:12,778
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review wherever you found this goes an awful long way, whether that was Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube.

967
01:26:12,758 --> 01:26:15,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all the kind words and comments.

968
01:26:15,903 --> 01:26:18,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I see an occasional YouTube comment pop in.

969
01:26:18,286 --> 01:26:19,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for all of that.

970
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:20,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.

971
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:22,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And please keep that coming.

972
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:25,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, let's get those final thoughts.

973
01:26:25,557 --> 01:26:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, before you head off to space, your final thoughts tonight.

974
01:26:32,427 --> 01:26:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too old for 13 hours.

975
01:26:35,171 --> 01:26:36,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a long marathon.

976
01:26:38,196 --> 01:26:39,257
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

977
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

978
01:26:39,598 --> 01:26:39,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

979
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

980
01:26:43,218 --> 01:26:51,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Another week's going to go by and another week that I'm hoping I can finish the data pack that I've been working on for now five weeks, four weeks.

981
01:26:51,819 --> 01:26:52,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time.

982
01:26:52,862 --> 01:26:53,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

983
01:26:54,305 --> 01:26:55,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

984
01:26:55,667 --> 01:27:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight is I downloaded this puzzle game on my phone that's pretty cute that one of my friends on Blue Sky was playing and I was like, I want to try that.

985
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:05,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Puzmo.

986
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Puzmo.

987
01:27:06,358 --> 01:27:13,486
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got all these weird... There's a crossword thing in it, which is actually my least favorite thing, but then they have other word games that are... I don't know.

988
01:27:13,606 --> 01:27:15,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I got sick of Wordle after six months.

989
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:20,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how some of you are still playing it, but there's other types of word games in there I think are really interesting.

990
01:27:20,534 --> 01:27:24,278
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a poker game too that was kind of fun, so I'm going to give a shout out to Puzmo.

991
01:27:24,258 --> 01:27:26,542
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

992
01:27:26,703 --> 01:27:28,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot of other thoughts.

993
01:27:28,426 --> 01:27:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So my other thought would be I'm going to try to play something besides Nostalgia this week.

994
01:27:35,178 --> 01:27:37,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But we won't be here next week.

995
01:27:37,082 --> 01:27:39,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got two weeks to do it, I guess.

996
01:27:39,647 --> 01:27:44,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm leaving town this Friday and I won't be back until Sunday night, which is why I'm missing a alarm.

997
01:27:44,596 --> 01:27:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: But I hope you guys have a great gaming two weeks.

998
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:51,748
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in two weeks to recap just before I leave again for DragonCon.

999
01:27:51,768 --> 01:27:54,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry about it, but August is busy and people have trips.

1000
01:27:54,712 --> 01:27:56,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you all have a wonderful night.

1001
01:27:56,454 --> 01:27:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1002
01:27:58,978 --> 01:27:59,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.
