39586	42490	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42510	46955	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46975	49438	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49498	53924	We're live once again for tonight, August the 20th.
53944	55106	Excuse me, not August the 23rd.
55166	56347	How about August the 3rd?
56387	57248	I'm fast forwarding time.
57589	62395	August the 3rd of 2025 with episode number 1057 of our show.
62835	66640	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined every week by my co-hosts.
66620	95952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
95932	96333	Hello.
96533	96974	Hi, Loki.
96994	97535	How are you doing?
97555	103306	We're stepping into the future, or maybe that's just like poop that we're stepping into now.
104088	105872	That's the future of the gaming industry.
106072	107395	It kind of smells like great now.
107415	108497	D, all of the above.
108757	110781	It's very that.
111843	115711	Well, I hope you're having a good week, despite all the poop going on in the world.
116031	117855	Is that Twisted Metal playing behind you tonight?
117835	118796	It is not.
119157	122301	It is a brand new game called Fumes.
122482	129852	So if you are a fan of like Vigilante 8 or Twisted Metal, Interstate 76 maybe a little bit.
129912	132215	I don't remember if that game was like Vigilante 8 or not.
132395	133317	I think it's the same universe.
133397	138544	But essentially it's like a PlayStation-esque...
139486	161781	Car Combat Game
161761	164485	Which you can feel free to do.
164605	170494	I guess I should always shill for the Twitch because we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
170534	175482	That's VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
175502	180489	And we don't really run ads in the middle of the show because we're trying to do a live thing that goes to our podcast feed.
180509	186478	But if you do have Twitch Turbo and we do run ads, like we do at the very beginning before we run live, we still get a cut of that.
186498	187600	So I actually...
187580	191184	I get my money's worth out of Twitch Turbo because I watch enough Twitch.
191244	196330	I watch as much Twitch as I do Paramount Plus or any of those subscription networks, so I get my money's worth.
196410	201156	But yeah, we certainly would not say no to your subscription money either over at VOG Network.
201176	204420	It helps us stay legal, which is always a good thing.
204800	208965	So anyway, yeah, we got the new season of Twisted Metals coming up on Peacock, so I thought that might have been it.
208985	212389	But I love that you're supporting the indie games and the up-and-coming stuff, so that's
212369	215415	Yeah, I've been looking forward to this one for a while.
215535	217840	I haven't picked it up just yet, but I'm probably going to.
218220	223290	Like I said, it just came out, and it's like 10% off right now, but we're checking it out.
223370	224773	Breakman is asking, this looks fun.
224853	225795	Is it on Steam?
226216	227278	It is on Steam, yeah.
227298	228821	It's called Fumes.
229001	230344	Smelling the paint fumes.
230324	235291	Like, going to the gas station and getting high off of the... Yeah, there you go.
235691	238796	Let's see, SS2100 Matt in chat made a comment earlier.
239156	243121	Loki is wearing glasses tonight, so he's bringing the Distinguished vibe.
243882	255999	I do it when I'm so, like, I've been trying to get myself in the mindset of, like, because I've been working on, not to get so much into my gaming week, but working on coding a data pack for Minecraft.
256299	257601	So that's your coding glasses.
258122	258222	Yeah.
258202	268101	Yeah, I try to associate it with myself that when I put the glasses on, I'm going to be focused and not get distracted by literally all of the other tabs I have open right now.
268261	270385	That's right.
270405	271307	Kids, don't bother me.
271488	273291	Daddy's got his coding glasses on.
273271	275354	It's not even the kids, it's just the internet.
275495	279361	And it's just like, uh, this is... Oh, YouTube.
280122	280703	Oh, Reddit.
281004	282546	Oh, Blue Sky.
282867	285331	It's just constant distractions.
286212	287835	I need a pair of coding glasses.
287995	292663	I have an eaten dress, but I don't have a pair of coding glasses.
292643	293985	and not an actual address.
294045	294967	It's just a joke.
295928	296349	Let's see.
297691	298772	Other comments in chat.
299133	302939	Some folks are commenting on other car destruction types of games.
302999	304801	QuestBuster saying I miss Carmageddon.
305643	308267	PodCulture says Red Asphalt was a good combat game.
308407	309549	I don't remember that being a game.
309649	311732	I remember that being a horrifying...
311712	313655	It was both.
313675	326498	No, just kidding.
327237	329021	No, yeah, it looks pretty good.
329942	334231	Which is funny because, well, it is funny to me because everybody was like, oh, the first season looked like garbage.
334291	338199	Like people were not ready for that first season, but it did fine.
338219	343890	I get fine enough to warrant a second season that apparently people are anticipating a lot more than the first one.
343911	344672	So that's good.
345192	348296	Yeah, here, I'm going to link the... Oh, someone already linked it in chat.
348396	348717	Never mind.
348977	350178	All right, you guys are on it.
350759	355786	I never underestimate the power of chat oogle, or chat GPT, literally.
356246	360772	All right, anyway, let's get into some kickoff topics for tonight.
360832	364617	Let's get into what is going on in the gaming world.
364637	369343	So I'm going to take it over to you, Loki, to start us off tonight, because Nintendo...
369323	397643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
398483	403067	Yeah, so just keep that in mind when you're looking for Switch games.
403347	405049	Make sure that you're aware what it is.
405389	409153	But, that said, there were quite a few trailers shown off for different games.
409593	414998	So, starting off, we had Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection, which looks pretty good.
415338	418081	That's expected to come out on the Switch 2 next year.
419262	426588	The game I'm literally most excited about from the entire Direct whatsoever is Once Upon a Katamari.
426668	428490	It's a brand new Katamari
428470	451255	Thanks for watching!
451235	456600	Did you catch the screenshot in part of the trailer that said, they're 69 cousins.
456940	457280	Nice.
457721	458842	Did you see that?
458902	460684	That cracked me up.
460764	465528	It was a lot more subtle than that, but it said something about collect all 69 cousins.
465888	466449	That's nice.
466589	467269	Or something like that.
467370	468591	I died.
468671	474076	I love humor that only potty humor minded people are going to get.
474556	476858	I'm down for a brand new Katamari game.
477399	481242	That announcement doesn't mean talked about enough.
481222	485828	Yeah, it's going to be out on consoles and Steam, so check it out wherever.
485868	489833	I've already pre-ordered that stuff, but yeah, I'm very excited about that.
489853	496821	Fifth dream in chat with a fair point, saying, I bet Keita Takahashi has nothing to do with it this time, and I think that's an extremely safe bet.
497282	503890	He's moved on a long time ago, so I think this really is a classic IP in new hands.
503910	507735	But, I mean, the Superman movie...
507952	514859	People seem to like Pretty Good, and that's an old IP in new hands, and people seem to be fine with it, for the most part.
515760	520084	So, you know, I'm open to where this Katamari game might go.
521906	532457	I feel like by them advertising the soundtrack, by what they're showing in the trailer, by making those little tongue-in-cheek sort of jokes that they said in there...
532437	536587	It's that they understand the spirit of why people love the game.
537149	539956	So I sort of like trust them enough to be able to do it, right?
539976	543845	Although sometimes you see people get an IP and it's like, what in the fuck are you doing?
543865	545149	Like Bomberman Act Zero.
545189	546773	Remember that on the Xbox 360?
546793	547695	Remember Bomberman Act Zero?
547675	548376	Was that what it was?
548797	550099	X-Zero, right?
550119	553705	The one that was all futuristic?
554026	559075	Let's take cutesy little Bomberman and make him fucking steampunk and see how that goes.
559095	559876	It's like, what?
560357	568671	So when you sort of see that the IP is in good hands, you are a little more open to what they're going to come up with.
568651	576025	Yeah, Konami is not... Konami had a rough patch where they tried to spin off... For like 20 years!
576225	578690	I feel like Konami is finally getting out of their rough patch.
578850	579832	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
579852	585462	Well, they're smart enough now to where they're pulling the Disney route is like...
585442	591434	All right, well, we can't trust ourselves to make these games, so we're just going to license the IP to more competent studios.
591454	592977	Well, what another great example.
593358	602416	Bloober team doing Silent Hill, and a lot of people were skeptical about that, but it turned out, hey, this is actually pretty good, and now they're going to do another one.
602436	607045	The Metal Gear Solid 3 remake looks pretty good, whereas Metal Gear Solid Survive sucked.
607396	609058	or Melga, yeah, was it five?
609318	609718	I don't remember.
609859	610299	Survive?
610639	613863	The one with the weird crystal zombies?
613883	615064	We don't talk about that, yeah.
615344	615825	That was weird.
617486	623813	Yeah, Remaria points out M2 doing Salamander 3, Dark Tooth Seism hyped for Gradius' 40th anniversary.
623933	625615	Yeah, like, there's a lot going on in that space, too.
625635	631681	Yeah, there's lots of, like, I want to see, I think, was Mega Man 11 without the folks behind Mega Man?
631701	635665	Yeah, because there was the whole, yeah, he went and made, um...
635645	636887	What was the other game?
636907	637288	Mighty No.
637308	637508	9.
637709	641115	That was the infamous divorce from Capcom and all that.
641195	643419	You'd be surprised.
643480	649371	Sometimes studios can carry on with the same style of game and stuff.
649451	652597	I did notice that the art style looks a little bit more detailed this time.
652637	658227	Because I remember with Katamari, it was very flat, cel-shaded almost to the...
658207	659889	for all of the artwork.
659909	663674	There was a little bit of details here and there, but it's similar enough.
663694	667859	To be fair, Katamari, the original, was a PlayStation 2 game.
667939	672345	We are now in the era where... I'm assuming this is targeted at the original Nintendo Switch.
672385	674127	I think it's both Switch and Switch 2.
674427	678813	The original Switch is still comparable to about a PS4, a little under a PS4.
679313	680535	So...
680515	692275	It's it's you should see some even if it's cel shaded, you should see some graphical, you know, and I imagine what they were showing was probably switch to footage, which is going to run probably a better frame rate.
692295	693797	So, yeah, yeah.
693817	694819	So it looks good.
694999	697984	And that's supposed to be out October 24th.
698386	698686	Cool.
698746	700348	Very, very excited about that.
701349	702050	What else?
702070	705874	I'm excited for Bobby Blackwolf to have more break music from the Katamari soundtrack.
705934	708037	Oh, no, he only does Overclock remixes, though.
708477	709458	Got it.
709739	711140	More music, more remixes.
711160	713943	Yeah, I'm still happy for the Overclock remix people to have more stuff to remix.
715785	719389	Literally, not a surprise whatsoever, Just Dance 2026 edition.
720010	721572	I mean, yeah, every year.
721932	723674	I mean, no shit.
723874	724495	Like...
725487	755190	if there wasn't a Just Dance game coming out this year I would say what's happening I want to be interested in Just Dance but I'm going to be honest it's connection to Ubisoft right now and everything that's going on at Ubisoft kind of makes me go it's got the ick like Just Dance has the ick right now I would rather picked up like a used copy of Just Dance for the PS3 or something than get this new thing I'm sorry but I'm also not sorry like there's just a lot of ick with Ubisoft right now
756588	762626	And it has nothing to do with the hardworking people actually putting on their coding glasses and making the games.
762927	765535	It's all the fuckery going on at the top.
765751	771601	Need to get like a Fortnite Dance Central game now that they own, you know, Harmonix essentially.
772302	776128	So we just get Dance Central and spend that off into something.
776148	776849	Now that I can go for.
776890	777330	Why not?
777390	780556	We have Rock Band essentially.
780576	782679	Rock Band 5 is in Fortnite essentially.
782699	785804	Yeah, if it didn't need to connect, I think Dance Central is pretty good.
785965	787547	But I mean, I don't know.
787567	788008	I get it.
788048	791033	I've played Just Dance before like a lot of years ago.
791013	798230	I don't know.
798450	801176	It doesn't feel like you're getting much each year, but whatever.
801257	802299	If people enjoy it, cool.
802419	802740	You know what?
802961	803622	I'm not here to
803855	804696	Judge what you enjoy.
806218	807759	Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.
808059	811383	So brand new fighting game coming to both the Switch and Switch 2.
812304	814887	It's getting ported over there November 14th.
815868	822155	We have a brand new remake of Plants vs. Zombies with Plants vs. Zombies Replanted.
822275	824457	That's also out on both systems as well.
824477	824717	Looks great.
824737	827280	I was kind of wondering what happened to this franchise.
827260	830145	I was thinking about PopCap the other day.
830165	838778	Remember how epic all those PopCap games used to be, and then EA kind of bought them, and they were going for a little bit, and we had the whole, it's Peggle 2, or was it Peggle 3?
838798	839139	I don't remember.
839159	840381	We did a little dance on stage.
840401	842404	I'm surprised there hasn't been another Peggle yet.
842424	843385	I think it's Peggle 2.
843466	846050	PopCap's kind of faded.
846070	848033	Like, I think Plant vs. Zombies, like, all just left.
848053	849675	But still, they have the IP for it.
849695	854002	Like, you can't tell me that they couldn't get, like, a B or C team to put out another Peggle game?
854042	854483	Like...
854463	858093	And why did we stop PopCap in the first place?
858795	862746	Like, those games were really addictive and fun, and you would think a lot of it would translate well to mobile.
863368	865975	I don't understand what happened there.
866225	871873	Maybe because they weren't built... I'm thinking back to Plants vs. Zombies.
871893	875177	I don't even know about 2 too much.
875558	877700	And they turned it into a first-person shooter?
877781	878582	Like Garden Warfare?
878962	880484	Well, Garden Warfare is that.
880504	886292	But I'm saying those games are meant to be more of that business model where...
886373	909782	and so on.
910876	913699	would have like a crap ton of monetization in it.
913739	915641	But like, yeah, they could.
915661	918745	I'm pretty sure there's like three versions of Bejeweled on mobile.
918765	920046	I'm almost positive that's a thing.
920086	920927	Bejeweled for sure.
921007	929837	Like, because I can see that people would, they would want to keep that going because of the Candy Crush, you know, phenomenon and stuff.
929877	931378	And it's very similar.
931398	938806	So I could see them doing that in like Zuma and I don't even know what else to say.
938827	940208	Oh man, Zuma, what a throwback.
940829	941590	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
941630	942911	So, lots of stuff.
943031	944112	But, hey, you know what?
944232	947535	I think we still have those old games on Steam, so that's great.
947555	948716	But yeah, this looks pretty fun.
948936	950838	I'm excited to check this out again.
950958	955562	That'll be coming out October 23rd for both Switch and Switch 2.
956823	961147	This I just didn't give a crap about because, you know, cool, it's coming to another console.
962208	963249	EA Sports FC26.
963289	966792	So, hey, cool, you're going to get it for the Switch and Switch 2.
966852	970836	Hopefully they don't treat it like they did with the previous Nintendo systems where you get this
970968	992166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
992281	1016820	We got another trailer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Evil Ace Chronicles And that's going to be coming out September 30th as well on Switch and Switch 2 I think it's also coming out on PlayStation Systems Oh yeah, that's been announced quite some time ago Yeah, for a while ago, yeah Persona 3 Reload coming to the Switch 2 as well, that's October 23rd Right in time for that to be delisted off Game Pass, by the way
1017053	1019457	That's getting removed from Game Pass this month.
1019537	1021781	I wonder if it's related.
1021801	1027230	We have another trailer for Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment.
1027651	1031637	I don't know when that's coming out yet, but at least we got a little bit more footage of that.
1031657	1034222	It looks like Hyrule Warriors, so it should be good.
1034482	1038589	Also, Madden 2026 coming out to the Switch 2.
1038569	1040932	This one was very strange.
1041293	1044817	It's a game called Chillin' by the Fire.
1045859	1048302	And it's a game where you make campfires.
1049343	1058415	And then just the camera support with it feels like... It honestly feels like an early Xbox Live Arcade game.
1058435	1060037	Like the way that it...
1060287	1086582	it's just weird like I don't know um like why I would hang out with people in front of like a campfire over a camera but okay it's a thing so you know that is out now you can check that out um Apex Legends coming to the Switch 2 as well so that's kind of a big deal I hope more of those free-to-play shooty bang bang games that's out uh this week so on the 5th
1087321	1090264	I feel like I should try that, but I'm terrible at that game.
1092967	1096191	Yeah, it looks kind of intense.
1096411	1100976	Hila, which is this mouse with a frog backpack.
1100996	1103599	And you kind of do a lot of platforming and exploring.
1103639	1106403	So that's coming out on, looks like, 2026.
1107063	1108725	Looked pretty cool, based on that.
1109806	1112429	Star Wars Outlaws getting ported to the Switch 2 as well.
1112490	1114712	That's coming out September 4th.
1114692	1120983	Also, Chronos The New Dawn is going to be coming out September 5th.
1121023	1123126	That's kind of a Dead Space-looking game.
1124248	1128235	We have Yakuza Kiwami 2 being ported to the Switch 2.
1129156	1130859	That's coming out November 13th.
1131600	1136869	And also, apparently, the first Kiwami game as well is going to be coming out on that same day.
1137608	1141752	Borderlands 4 being ported as well to the Switch 2.
1141832	1144034	They also had some other games they showed off.
1144054	1153422	NBA Bounce, Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Romancing Saga 2, and Shinobi Art of Vengeance all being ported to the Switch 2.
1154103	1163091	And then kind of the last bit that we saw that was shown off by Square Enix are new games using that HD 2D engine.
1163131	1167615	So we have a brand new series that looks like The Adventures of Elliot.
1167595	1185925	The Millennium Tales That's on the Switch 2 next year But they have a demo out You can check that out I don't like that name at all With the double the I don't think it's a good name I think they should have just called the game Elliot It's just It's a weird name
1186090	1207609	Octopath Traveler Zero
1207589	1226475	I would really love to see that Final Fantasy series any of it just put into this engine
1226455	1226876	I know.
1226896	1228520	Like, any of, like, the one through six.
1228540	1231025	But we just had, well, we just had the pixel remasters.
1231045	1231927	I don't care!
1232508	1234072	Like, that stopped anybody else.
1234092	1234553	I know you don't.
1234573	1239564	Like, I mean, how many times have we had, was it, The Last of Us remade the last five years or whatever?
1239624	1242390	It's like, that's not a reason not to do it.
1242591	1245898	I would say either another sequel...
1245878	1249542	And that, like, we had a Final Fantasy IV The After Years.
1249643	1253347	I think people would eat the fuck up out of a Final Fantasy VI too.
1253788	1258593	I think people would lose their fucking minds if Square ever did a Final Fantasy VI too.
1258934	1260095	And that seems the most obvious.
1260135	1266503	You know, II and III just weren't really released in America and have that same sort of, you know...
1266483	1268786	We didn't grow up on those games as much.
1268826	1271869	Final Fantasy V kind of falls to the same thing.
1271969	1273511	And IV already had a sequel.
1273531	1275974	I think the original is really hard to do a direct sequel to.
1276014	1281741	Plus, we already had Strangers of Paradise, spoiler alert, and some other things that were really in that same thing.
1282341	1287407	I would say Final Fantasy VI is most prime for a pixel sequel.
1287788	1290791	But it's Chrono Trigger's turn.
1291592	1294195	That's the game that makes the most sense to do in this.
1294756	1294836	Yes.
1294816	1295477	Me!
1295717	1295938	Me!
1296078	1296558	I'm saying this.
1296919	1299102	But do you know what I would really want?
1299122	1301225	You know what I would really want from the Enix catalog?
1301726	1303869	How about the Terranigma trilogy?
1303889	1306793	How about that whole stuff?
1306833	1308576	Illusion of Gaia and those guys.
1308656	1311239	They're action-based, so it'd be a little different.
1311600	1312701	But those are the games.
1312922	1318009	Brain Lord, Terranigma, that's the series I would love to see in this.
1318690	1319691	I mean... I don't know.
1319812	1322275	If we got Live Alive, anything's possible, but...
1322255	1329784	I mean, it is the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger, so... It seems like it's time.
1330422	1331163	Maybe, maybe.
1332064	1333625	Let's see.
1334466	1335047	Yeah, let's see.
1335187	1335868	Go into chat.
1336408	1340473	S2100 Matt says, can't wait for Legend of Octopath, Octopath to the past.
1341454	1342255	The Adventures of Elliot.
1342275	1342835	That looked great.
1342875	1344097	Yeah.
1344417	1346579	And Dark2CS says, highly recommend the Shinobi demo.
1346599	1347340	It's so good.
1347841	1351965	Bobby pointing out that the Final Fantasy 6 pixel remaster did have one scene in that engine.
1352005	1352706	Yeah, it looked great.
1352726	1354888	It was really, yeah.
1354928	1359233	Fifth Dream says, the same guy who localized Pokemon, the English, did Terranigma 2.
1359313	1360294	I didn't know that.
1360477	1389336	that's pretty cool how about um Secret of Mana already I guess those games I guess we got Secrets of the Secret of Mana and then we had Visions of Mana right which was second to third I guess maybe uh no I'm Secret of Evermore that's what I meant Secret of Evermore is what I want to see but again I think that was a different engine they used for all that so yeah um yeah right Quest Buster, Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma in one package would rock absolutely
1389417	1391023	Absolutely.
1391527	1392809	Let's see.
1393170	1395012	What did you think of the direct overall?
1395713	1403205	My Blue Sky feed was kind of filled with very tepid sort of... It wasn't a great... I don't think people loved it.
1404006	1409094	Yeah, I don't really have high expectations for the partner directs usually, so it wasn't like I was expecting anything.
1409134	1415524	I was just more of... I think I was just more excited about the whole Kanamari announcement, and then the rest was like, okay, that's fine.
1416265	1418448	There's nothing really else I'm excited about.
1419790	1420251	So...
1420923	1423607	I don't know, but I wasn't looking to be excited by anything.
1423788	1425270	I don't think it was bad.
1425290	1438712	I think it just maybe lacked a lot of real surprises, and that is due to the nature of the Switch 2 being announced sort of off-cycle with all the other industry announcements, so this felt like there was a lot of catching up for
1438692	1442657	are games coming out to other platforms that will also be coming out to Switch 2.
1443057	1448844	So it took a little bit of the, ooh, this is a new thing, shiny, sort of factor out of it.
1448864	1451487	And therefore, I think it lost a little bit of steam for some people.
1452328	1457754	I think now that we've had this, the Switch 2 has kind of caught up with everybody else at this point.
1457774	1467906	And now maybe when we get to things like the Game Awards in December, which I guess would probably be our next big announcement set, unless Nintendo does a first party thing for...
1467886	1482182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1482567	1500863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1500995	1509526	So, and I would assume that Metroid Prime 4 is going to be that, you know, Friday before Thanksgiving week.
1510127	1516435	Because we already have a date for Legends ZA, which I agree is going to be a huge title and it's going to be, you know, one of the reasons to own a Switch 2.
1516475	1518698	Except that, actually, that game is on Switch and Switch 2.
1519258	1521962	But I guess, to be fair, so would Metroid Prime 4.
1521982	1529972	And they have the bundle for that as well, for the Switch 2, where they're doing the same thing that they did with Mario Kart 4.
1530239	1540806	so it's hard to say, it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo chooses to announce but I think then we'll get a lot more big games next year so we'll see
1540938	1546328	Uh, okay, let's move on to our gaming weeks and the types of games that we have been playing this week.
1546348	1549453	So, Loki, you were kind of referencing your gaming week earlier, but how was your gaming week?
1549574	1558710	Yep, I mean, it's basically the same as last week, so it's just been Minecraft and coding my data pack in Minecraft, so still working on that, slowly going along.
1558830	1563098	I almost have the entire game loop done, I still have to debug everything, and
1563078	1564980	Then add all this stuff in there.
1565120	1569925	The problem is I keep taking stuff in there and I'm like, oh, hey, cool, I can do this thing.
1569945	1572408	And then it gets even more complicated and stuff.
1572448	1579795	So, you know, I was watching different Minecraft events that some of the people I know were in this week.
1579835	1586202	And I'm like, wow, the stuff that they're doing in those data packs is even less advanced than the stuff I'm doing in this one.
1586222	1587043	So...
1587023	1588852	I don't know, but we'll see.
1589174	1593979	I'm trying to get it done sooner than later because it's been like 30...
1594195	1619646	Okay.
1620284	1625969	My gaming week, honestly, truly, I have almost exclusively been playing Final Fantasy XI.
1626149	1626630	That's right.
1626790	1628131	Remember when I brought that up last week?
1628191	1628892	I know, right?
1628912	1631574	Well, so here's the thing, and I've learned a little more about this whole setup.
1631594	1634857	So I'm playing on a – and this is because of retro achievements.
1634877	1647449	I was like – I discovered randomly one day that they had retro achievements for Final Fantasy XI, and I kind of was laughing going, oh, they've got to be impossible, like they were on the Xbox, like get to level 75 at every job and that sort of thing, right?
1647609	1647709	Yeah.
1647689	1650694	And so I was looking and I was like, well, how are they doing that anyway?
1650714	1653098	Is it through like a PS2 emulator, but the servers are down?
1653179	1657105	And so it's actually this private system called Horizon.
1657466	1660351	But Horizon is actually kind of trying to do its own thing with the game.
1661052	1663757	It's a very big, I guess, sort of private server.
1663737	1685087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1685067	1710552	and so on and so forth.
1710532	1715361	instead of doing one damage a tick, it does four damage a tick to make it a little bit more of a viable spell.
1715701	1717845	And they adjusted some levels of some spells.
1717865	1722152	They just some little things just to try to bring, I think, a little bit of balance to the game.
1723194	1727562	But I'm shocked at how many people are actively playing like the servers.
1727542	1744116	and many more.
1744096	1746740	Just like the old days and all those sorts of things.
1747181	1749945	So I'm just very impressed at kind of what they built.
1750186	1757918	But the interesting thing is, even though it's a 75 experience, they do have some features that are from the newer expansions like level sync.
1758299	1761684	Level sync didn't happen until like Abyssia.
1761764	1764368	It was when they bumped to 99 that they brought in level sync.
1764629	1768635	But I do think that makes the game better, really, because it makes it more people.
1768919	1798369	because I thought I had my client in Steam but I got it through Amazon a long time ago and so I have the Final Fantasy XI Ultimate Collection Abyssia Edition yeah yeah that's what Alan bought me years ago because I was like I don't remember my play online login and it's tied to an email I can't access anymore so I don't know how the fuck I'm ever going to get these characters back and so he just bought me the Steam Edition because it was on sale for like 20 bucks for like everything and so I played to experience the book burning and everything new in the game but none of that is in
1798349	1800512	This Horizon experience.
1800532	1803456	But it's just really neat to see what the community has built.
1803496	1805980	The Discord is extremely active.
1806000	1812770	Like, it's... Loki, I know you and I burned a lot of hours on that game back in the day.
1812790	1819820	It is such a different experience when you have a Discord where the entire server is basically tied together, right?
1819840	1821883	So people can do shouts and asks in Discord.
1822304	1825468	And, like, it's not... You can find things a lot faster.
1825488	1826770	And then Wiki...
1826750	1842750	Thank you for watching!
1842983	1846748	and the official strategy guide, it was a lot harder.
1846768	1849571	So yeah, my nostalgia is definitely strong with Final Fantasy XI.
1849691	1852896	I don't know how long it'll last, but I'm enjoying it this week.
1852916	1860105	I actually did get an achievement because there is an achievement for getting a crystal for the Krags.
1860125	1860806	You remember the Krags?
1860846	1864350	The Dem, Mea, what's the other one called?
1864330	1870229	Uh, Hala, Hala, those crags, you get a crystal at the crag so you can teleport there, right?
1870530	1873480	So I got my, I got a crystal crag and I got an achievement.
1873915	1878803	Yeah, with everybody like, teleport, teleport, teleport, you know.
1878824	1883051	SJ100Matt says, so is it more doable solo or do you still need to depend on parties?
1883812	1885555	You need to depend on parties.
1885575	1893689	But people are a lot easier to find because they have the Discord and they have other sort of ways to try to find people.
1893709	1895232	And keep in mind...
1895212	1899377	I haven't ran into toxic people yet, but I haven't done a lot of partying.
1899397	1900979	But here's the thing to keep in mind.
1901440	1909270	Most of the audience that's going to be into Final Fantasy XI are people that were playing it originally when they were teenagers or in their 20s.
1909290	1912354	So most of the player base is like grown the fuck up.
1912434	1915437	It's people in their late 30s and 40s that are mostly playing this.
1915618	1917240	Not all, but mostly.
1917260	1921525	So I think by nature with that, you get rid of a lot of the edgelords.
1921545	1923868	Not completely, but mostly.
1923848	1931456	So I would say, though, if you do want to do the solo type thing, then by all means, the original Final Fantasy XI is still a thing.
1931476	1932317	You can solo it.
1932337	1938984	It just has a monthly fee, which again, Square, Square, Square, Enix, Enix, Enix, Square, Enix.
1939004	1941386	Just bundle the XIV and the XI fees.
1941526	1942047	Give me a break.
1942928	1945070	Paying for XIV should also give you access to XI.
1945691	1952978	It would do you so much better in these times when Final Fantasy XIV has been losing a little bit of steam lately.
1953380	1969650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1969985	1988280	Thanks for watching!
1988260	1990643	Just, you know, just do a thing.
1990824	1996692	Just, you know, accomplish a little bit and just, you know, kind of explore and just go back to remembering what the game is.
1996732	2004483	I just know that when they changed everything, like the meta as far as like where to level up, like completely changed when they did that.
2004503	2006286	Because I remember like it was...
2006266	2012736	Oh, yeah, you... I mean, the first part's still okay, where you go, like, to... You have rabbits.
2012756	2017743	Near your starter towns, and then the desert, but then it's like, then you go to a cave.
2017884	2019807	Yeah, you go to Gusken Mines and burn books.
2019867	2020748	Gusken Mines, yeah.
2020768	2022831	That wasn't how it was in the original.
2022851	2023853	Yeah, no, it's way different now.
2024634	2025355	Um...
2025335	2047815	but uh um I was gonna say with Horizon one of the other things I think is really interesting is that they actually have a remixed version of the soundtrack which I can kind of give or take the remixes of the city music and the music that was there originally and like um you know the starting zones like I'm just gonna be honest I maybe that my nostalgia bone kind of
2047795	2067340	and DarkSakura.
2067320	2093479	and DarkSakura.com.
2093459	2101470	Even if I didn't really care for the remix, I do like what they did to their all-original songs to add a little something in the areas that didn't have them.
2101490	2106938	I mean, I would still have to go back and get that sound replacer thing to put the battle music in there.
2106978	2108580	Which I think is really easy to do.
2108800	2113347	I don't think it's as hard as it was when PlayOnline... Because this whole thing strips out PlayOnline.
2113727	2116771	You make your character on the web, and then it's waiting for you in the game.
2117292	2119776	So it strips out PlayOnline completely.
2120717	2120817	Yeah.
2120797	2147833	so I think it's a little easier to do that stuff oh and this thing embraces most add-ons there's like there's white listed add-ons and there's banned add-ons but all the white listed things are like mini maps things that are like quality of life that you know are not hurting the game to have it's like notorious monster snipers are the things that are in the banned add-ons they're very strict on real money trading so which of course they should be
2147813	2149455	Um, okay, that's enough about that.
2149475	2151599	But I will say I did play a couple other games this week.
2151619	2157227	So I went to my friend's house the other night, and he has this really cool setup where he has two big TVs.
2157247	2167742	And I have not ever really experimented with this, but he does emulators and he'll do multiple emulators all running at the same time to play multiplayer online experiences.
2168223	2171087	So we were playing Resident Evil Outlast.
2171067	2199707	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2199687	2200368	No, that is it.
2200388	2200748	Dark Disney.
2200768	2201769	It's Outbreak, not Outlast.
2201809	2202210	It's Outbreak.
2202950	2203871	Resident Evil Outbreak.
2203891	2206193	And yeah, that was fun.
2207194	2207935	It was fun to play it.
2208276	2210958	We cleared two scenarios and had fun doing that.
2210978	2214822	And then we went over to the Dolphin emulator, which I never realized.
2214842	2218686	Did you know Dolphin has Game Boy Advance emulators built into it?
2219166	2219907	I never realized.
2220308	2224992	I mean, I could see that because it's got the Game Boy player.
2225032	2225813	And they come up in separate.
2225793	2238335	I just never realized that was in there.
2238575	2245607	It should have
2245587	2247511	I mean, I should have figured that out.
2247611	2249775	Of course, they're going to have something to address that.
2249795	2250436	But I don't know.
2250516	2256087	My brain was always, oh, Dolphin's just focused on the emulation of like the, you know, GameCube and all that.
2256227	2258892	And the, you know, the Wii and all that stuff.
2259113	2260034	So, yeah.
2260215	2260736	Okay, thank you.
2260756	2261217	I'm not alone.
2261277	2263661	SSJ100Matt says, didn't know Dolphin did that either.
2263721	2264282	Yeah, it does.
2264403	2265886	Go to the controllers.
2266286	2268270	And there's like a native...
2268250	2270913	Game Boy Advance emulator built in.
2270933	2276278	And so now I'm like, ooh, I want to play Animal Crossing and go to the island on that thing because that was always fun.
2278240	2278500	All right.
2279161	2280402	That's it for my gaming week.
2280422	2282684	So we're going to get into some news.
2282744	2285326	Just a reminder, we will not be here in two weeks.
2285447	2288510	I will be out of town on the 17th, but we will be back next week.
2288550	2290151	DarkSakura ought to be back as well.
2290171	2292533	We'll talk about all the gaming news that comes back in the next week.
2292694	2296317	But until then, let's get to the news from this week.
2296297	2298900	Loki, in this ongoing saga, right?
2299741	2310914	Yeah, so we have more updates regarding the whole Visa MasterCard blocking not safe for work games through the payment processors.
2310934	2314898	So it's a little bit kind of a he said, she said type thing going on.
2315058	2322507	So essentially, you've got MasterCard, which put out a thing on their social media saying...
2322487	2338223	clarifying recent headlines on gaming content and saying that MasterCard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms contrary to media reports and allegations.
2338323	2343568	Our payment networks follow a standard base of rules of law.
2343889	2348433	Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network.
2348473	2352257	At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure
2352237	2357068	MasterCard cards and, you know, that they'd hear to that stuff.
2357649	2366229	The thing is, though, Valve then elaborated on that as well, saying, well, hold on, that may not entirely be true.
2366289	2367732	It says, um,
2368032	2372238	MasterCard did not communicate with Valve directly despite our request to do so.
2373700	2380589	MasterCard communicated with our payment processor through and their acquiring banks.
2381029	2387458	Payment processors communicated with this with Valve and we replied by outlining Steam's policy.
2387438	2392043	Since 2018 of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution.
2392503	2402234	Payment processors rejected this and specifically cited MasterCard's rule 5.12.7 and the risk to MasterCard brand.
2402254	2416990	And apparently that rule states a merchant must not submit to its acquirer and a customer must not submit to interchange systems and transaction that is illegal in the sole discretion of the corporation may
2417257	2420806	Damage the goodwill of corporations or reflect negatively on the marks.
2421067	2424495	Essentially saying that they can't sell a game that's going to make MasterCard look bad.
2424515	2429267	Honestly, I don't think anyone knows that MasterCard's behind a lot of this stuff anyways, and I don't think it really matters.
2429909	2432295	I think it's great that Valve spoke up.
2432275	2462282	I think it's great that Valve spoke up.
2462262	2477284	Yeah, it is.
2477264	2489080	So y'all need to figure your morals out because it's not okay that books and movies and violence can play by one set of rules.
2489100	2494467	But these other games that may have themes, which if it's a gross game to you, that's fine.
2494487	2501837	But that's for you to be able to make that – or a parent to be able to make that determination about because for some people – some people find –
2501817	2503460	And I don't expect everybody to understand this.
2503961	2511773	Some people find release and therapy in working through difficult themes that may or may not have impacted them personally.
2511793	2515840	So it's not your decision what to spend your money on at the end of the day.
2515860	2520728	And that at the core is like the problem here is that it definitely has that appearance.
2521049	2522471	We've talked about this a lot, right?
2522812	2525496	It doesn't matter what the facts are.
2525476	2528781	Everything in gaming is going to be what is perceived.
2528801	2534449	And the perception that's happening here is that the credit card companies control what we can and can't buy.
2534910	2537233	And people are not taking that anymore.
2537253	2541019	And yeah, MissingNo says you don't see them blocking payments on OnlyFans.
2541039	2542040	Nope.
2542321	2544063	And, you know, or guns.
2544484	2546126	Can I use my visa at the gun show?
2546968	2548029	I'm pretty sure I can.
2548810	2550312	Can I use my visa at the gun show?
2550573	2550673	Nope.
2552543	2577690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2578193	2583719	If you have to ask yourself what is a shitting table, it's not for you.
2583739	2586803	Don't go chasing waterfalls.
2586823	2589106	Stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
2590728	2600539	But trust me, organizations like the one in Australia that got this ban would probably be horrified at these types of things and tell you that you can't have them.
2601920	2605426	Jay Helinski in chat says, Man, Rob, what are you into?
2605947	2614041	I am into going to the hard places to find the facts and analysis for you, the viewer and listener here on Orange Launch Radio.
2614582	2617667	So don't fucking get it twisted, y'all.
2619638	2619999	All right.
2620480	2621643	Anyway, where were we at, Loki?
2621683	2627118	Anyways, so not only Steam, of course, was affected by all that.
2627359	2636162	HIO, of course, was removing games off or delisting games and even blocking payments.
2636142	2649932	they're still kind of doing that but they are at least re-indexing the adult games that are free so they're doing that right now and they also said that they're working on getting a different payment processor
2650503	2661221	Strype is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners.
2661241	2673321	Despite card networks generally supporting adult content with the appropriate registrations, Strype has indicated that they'll hope to be able to support adult content in the future.
2675427	2681318	Yeah, I mean, I think then if it isn't MasterCard, then you start naming names.
2681358	2682581	In this case, Stripe.
2682701	2685125	Okay, now we start calling their customer service.
2686087	2691538	Like, they shouldn't be able to dictate speech.
2691558	2692339	Stay in your lane.
2694142	2697706	Also, Blake, once again, who pays attention to payment processors?
2698507	2699128	Nobody.
2699568	2701491	Like, unless it's PayPal, because PayPal sucks.
2701511	2707738	But, like, nobody is paying attention to, hmm, who are their payment processors on this website?
2708259	2708960	Shame.
2709160	2710241	Like, no one cares.
2712384	2716048	And then, as a bit of, you know...
2716703	2719127	ProTest for this whole thing as well.
2719948	2730264	Good Old Games is basically launching a website called FreedomToBuy.Games to raise awareness on censorship in gaming.
2731326	2737075	And with that, they have offered up 15 games for free.
2737055	2742263	But I will say that GOG is kind of the ambulance chaser of the gaming industry.
2742283	2747311	And get your coin, do what you need to do, but GOG is kind of the ambulance chaser.
2747331	2753881	And what I mean, you know, they're the lawyers behind the ambulance trying to, you know, something wrong, call Anne Fong, that type of thing.
2753901	2755924	That's, you know, what they're...
2755904	2782418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2782398	2785082	Here we are talking about them and giving them a free ad.
2785602	2789388	They're doing what they need to do, but like, girl, I see you.
2789408	2790990	Girl, oh girl, GOG.
2791050	2792652	Girl, oh girl, I see you.
2792692	2794875	Girl, oh girl, she's at it again.
2794895	2798360	Girl, oh girl, she saw a headline and now she's got to do something about it.
2798921	2801965	That's GOG.
2801985	2802225	Yeah.
2803187	2810717	Yeah, so... So basically, you know, yeah, it does seem like there's a lot of, like, grasping for attention, but...
2811440	2812602	Free is free.
2813523	2814224	But free is free.
2815285	2821834	So if you want Postal 2 and a bunch of anime booby games, they're free for another three hours.
2822394	2823195	Yeah, three hours.
2823436	2826840	So you got to get them now on those of you that are listening live.
2826880	2839096	Those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably out of time, but stay tuned for whatever Girl, Oh Girl does next because, you know, they're going to chase the headlines.
2839156	2840518	They're going to chase the clout.
2843030	2845033	Oh, oh, she's making a scene again?
2845213	2846355	Girl, oh girl.
2849680	2850001	Anyway.
2851604	2853406	Let's talk about what's going on at EVO.
2853707	2855069	That's right, EVO is the thing.
2855089	2859216	EVO is going on right now, and there are some updates going on over there.
2860117	2862941	And let's talk about some things that have happened at the show.
2862961	2865325	And some of you in chat might have some other updates for me.
2865345	2869071	These are the things I have so far, but some stuff may have come up tonight as we're taping.
2869051	2895598	Virtua Fighter 5
2895578	2915562	VIRTUA FIGHTER 5 REVO
2915542	2920609	This is going to be automatically updated if you own that to the world stage version.
2920629	2926757	So if you own Virtua Fighter Ultimate Showdown on PlayStation 4, you can update for a discounted price of $9.99.
2927177	2930141	So this is just, you know, this is the ultimate edition.
2930742	2939253	As we see oftentimes in the fighting game world, this should not really be new information to anybody that follows fighting games.
2940274	2944840	And thank you, TigerClaw says, they say it's the PlayStation 2 version of the Mortal Kombat trilogy.
2945157	2947541	How about the Capcom Fighting Collection 2?
2947681	2954091	That's pretty fun, a good collection, and they're going to be doing a free title update, and it's going live this week.
2954231	2957937	New content and improvements, including some remix tracks.
2958738	2965970	Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper is also getting four new characters, and of course the collection itself already has eight games in it.
2966671	2972700	But if you're late to the party, then take note that you'll be getting some extra little upgrades with this.
2972680	2974842	Street Fighter 6 DLC.
2974922	2976404	A brand new character was announced.
2976444	2980167	It's probably the biggest non-surprise ever because they've been hinting at this for a while.
2980187	2984891	But Crimson Viper, Sea Viper, is going to be added to the roster for Street Fighter 6.
2985092	2986013	Anyone surprised?
2986133	2986553	Me neither.
2987294	2989456	And then Fatal Fury, City of the Wolves.
2989516	2990657	This is pretty cool.
2990677	2994240	Fatal Fury is getting Ken, as in Street Fighters.
2994360	2996002	Ken is coming to that.
2996663	2997443	Yeah, not Barbie.
2999906	3002468	Although, now that you said that...
3003089	3026363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3026765	3036858	Tiger Claw also points out one of the main things they talked about with Mortal Kombat Trilogy is Shang Tsung's morphine will be fixed because in the original it was causing lag because it was loading from the disc.
3037520	3038985	Oh yes, I remember that.
3039961	3060417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3061814	3063817	Plus the souped up system probably helps as well.
3064698	3069565	Tiger Claw also wants to point out they revealed Battle Beast as a playable character in Invincible Versus.
3070146	3071348	Lots of new character announcements.
3071388	3074613	And there may be more before the show is done because I think Evo is still going.
3074633	3076295	I think it wraps up tonight.
3076375	3080582	But we may get a couple big announcements or two still before it's all done.
3080602	3083286	So if we hear anything live, we'll break in and announce it.
3083426	3086370	Otherwise, we'll go to our next story, which is...
3087076	3088478	We all knew it was coming, right, Loki?
3088498	3089921	It's not a surprise.
3089941	3098275	I mean, we've already seen this before the Switch 2 launched, but now we're getting more updates as, of course, tariffs and all that stuff change.
3098295	3111278	So because of that, prices are going up on Switch accessories, Alarmo, Amiibo, but not the Switch 2 system, at least.
3111258	3119915	But yeah, basically all of the accessories and whatnot are going up in price.
3119935	3122019	Which would include Switch 2 accessories.
3122039	3123743	So like Joy-Con and stuff.
3123783	3129975	So even though we're saying the Switch 2 system isn't going up in price, the accessories are, which still does have an impact.
3130006	3148626	Yeah, so these include, was it the Nintendo Switch OLED model, the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite, select Nintendo Switch accessories, Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select Amiibo, the Alarmo, and yeah, I think that... I thought Alarmo was one of those things that they only put out limited time.
3148666	3149928	I didn't realize you could even still get one.
3149988	3153111	I thought it was like those game watches and the classic consoles.
3153191	3155794	Okay, I never realized they were still selling them, to be quite honest.
3156770	3174222	um yeah so they had they had all that and of course uh they i think they released that information via the nintendo today app so i gotta you know control that narrative but i mean we know why it's not a surprise it's not like they're trying to be greedy here it's just
3175248	3177333	Yeah, prices of other consoles went up too.
3177734	3178976	Did we ever get Sony prices?
3179016	3180500	I know we got Microsoft prices in Greece.
3180520	3181422	Did we get Sony ones?
3181442	3182023	I don't remember.
3182644	3185952	I think they did it before all that tariff stuff started happening.
3185972	3187134	Certain countries.
3187275	3191063	Yeah, I don't know.
3191195	3194263	Yeah, but still, I mean, we knew this was coming.
3194383	3199718	So that's, you know, elections, consequences, etc, etc.
3199878	3207077	So yeah, if you don't like it, let your representative know not that it's going to change a damn thing, but it's nice to think it might.
3207968	3210511	But they've already sold 6 million Switch 2s.
3210531	3215517	So, I mean, pricing isn't necessarily slowing people down from getting a Switch 2.
3216197	3218300	They're hoping to sell 15 by the end.
3218520	3221664	With the Switch 1 prices going up, they're just going to sell more Switch 2s.
3221684	3225968	Because at this point, why would you get an OLED Switch when you can just get a Switch 2?
3225988	3229993	I mean, I guess it does have a better screen, but I just don't... For now.
3230193	3234398	For now, it's not a deal breaker for me, but maybe a deal breaker for somebody else.
3234378	3241447	Yeah, I mean, so they're hoping to sell 50 million by March 2026, so the end of the financial year.
3242709	3244351	And yeah, I don't know.
3244692	3246454	They'll probably do it.
3247676	3250579	Yeah, it'll sell lots this holiday, I'm sure.
3250599	3255906	Unless something really insane happens or like 500 million percent tariffs.
3256707	3262495	You know, as long as nothing stupid like that happens, I think they should be fine.
3262947	3265955	I don't think is ever a guarantee that it won't.
3266076	3266597	So we'll see.
3267921	3269566	Let's talk about the PlayStation 6.
3269886	3270368	That's right.
3270468	3272193	We're going to go ahead and talk about the PlayStation 6.
3272614	3274098	Rumors and speculation.
3274118	3274419	That's right.
3274439	3275101	Our favorite.
3275181	3276525	Rumors and speculation.
3276545	3277247	But here's the thing.
3277347	3277969	I don't...
3277949	3304598	MorsLawIsDead
3304578	3327497	and it's apparently information that came from a leaked AMD presentation to Sony back in 2023 so because it's a couple years old some of this may still have changed it's not all necessarily set in stone it's all rumors in the first place but so so take it with the gigantic um salt that it's needs to be um
3328473	3354531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3354511	3366177	So the leaks in this are saying that the company is going to be prioritizing lower power output to keep costs in line with previous generations for the PlayStation 6.
3366518	3374055	So they're trying to not up the price for this and they're going to lower the power output because the older PlayStations can be a little bit of jet engine sometimes.
3374035	3378982	Also, they're saying that in the PlayStation 6, there will be three times the rasterization.
3379262	3381145	That's 3D rendering.
3381485	3387153	And that's in comparison to the base PlayStation 5 and twice what the PlayStation 5 Pro has right now.
3387653	3396125	They're also saying that there will be backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4, which makes sense because I think that was the last time they changed the main chipset, right, Loki?
3396165	3397647	So they're not having the same...
3397627	3421002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3420982	3430212	So apparently indicating that they want to tap into success that the PlayStation 4 had, and part of that was because of the lower price that it had.
3430232	3431534	Now, here's where things get interesting.
3432215	3434777	Apparently, Sony is also working on a handheld.
3435158	3439383	We've heard this before, that Sony may be coming back into the handheld game.
3439403	3448353	And apparently, this PlayStation 6 handheld will have a microSD slot, a touchscreen, haptic vibrations, and dual microphones.
3448533	3449554	Interesting.
3449534	3458594	Apparently the PlayStation 6 handheld would be better than what we see with the Xbox Ally X. And there'll also be a USB-C port for video out.
3458614	3464708	So it almost sounds like maybe some type of like Switch adjacent sort of thing.
3466139	3468883	You know, technology in this thing.
3469323	3469624	Maybe.
3469644	3470385	Maybe.
3470725	3471146	I don't know.
3471166	3473529	But, you know, especially with cloud and all this, who knows?
3473990	3474370	Who knows?
3474991	3489290	So, I mean, I'm not surprised to hear that PlayStation might try to get back into this handheld thing a little bit, especially considering the success that Nintendo's had on that front and that the Switch system works for them.
3489731	3491573	Although I just, I hope...
3492143	3493465	as Jonah and Matt says.
3493485	3495487	So, OLR, PSP, HD remake?
3495527	3498211	Well, that depends on what they let people build for it.
3499332	3504699	But Sony would have to support the hardware a little longer than they usually do.
3504719	3508765	We all know Sony's track record with supporting hardware is mediocre at best.
3508785	3514472	They also need to come up with things that make a lot more fucking sense than PSNear
3514452	3522966	and some of these things that they tried to do with the handhelds that were like you had to have a manual to explain it to somebody and that didn't work in their favor.
3523247	3533665	But I think it's an interesting direction especially when technologically we may have hit the point about as far as we can go with that.
3533685	3534486	So...
3534466	3552762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3553788	3555910	So anyway, PlayStation 6.
3556331	3556731	That's all.
3556892	3560996	I don't think we need to say much more about it now because it's too early.
3561116	3562458	We'll see the facts later on.
3562478	3564340	But it's interesting to hear what they might be doing.
3565161	3566883	And the handheld thing is fascinating to me.
3566903	3570327	I think a lot of people would love for Sony to get back into the handheld business.
3570907	3571548	I do.
3571608	3574051	As critical as I am of how they handled some things, I'd love to see it.
3575232	3575873	Yeah.
3575893	3576133	All right.
3576434	3578496	Loki, another direct this week.
3578678	3586073	Yeah, so THQ Nordic had their direct showcase showing off some of the stuff coming out in 2025.
3586674	3588337	So they have a few games that look pretty cool.
3589019	3594750	We had Spongebob Squarepants Titans of the Tide with David Hasselhoff in there.
3594790	3598678	That's pretty awesome, just like the movie in the show.
3599738	3618979	Tides of Tomorrow Wreck Nation Wreck Nation
3620005	3648375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3648693	3659783	that they're going to be releasing, Gothic 1 Remake, and I believe they said Gothic 1 through 3 is going to be hitting Game Pass pretty soon, so look for that.
3660202	3663766	Really cool looking game called The Eternal Life of Goldman.
3665628	3675519	Kind of like a twisted looking thing, but it's a 2D platformer that blends, I guess, dark fairy tales, myths, and mystery, they say.
3676660	3677421	It looks interesting.
3677481	3682547	It reminded me a lot of... Oh gosh, what was the old...
3683371	3684172	2D platforming.
3684452	3685113	I don't remember now.
3685153	3688517	There was one on Xbox Live Arcade that was pretty similar.
3688557	3689138	It reminded me.
3689738	3690739	But yeah, it looks really cool.
3690920	3691921	So check that out.
3692081	3693563	Titan Quest 2.
3695144	3697567	They said early access is now starting.
3698068	3699830	So that's going to be pretty cool.
3700310	3702773	We have the Guild Europa 1410.
3703133	3707218	It's kind of a world building dynasty sim game.
3707823	3711630	Re-Animal looks very strange.
3712111	3715697	This is from the creators of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2.
3716098	3719344	It's a co-op horror adventure game.
3720025	3721207	And yeah, it's creepy looking.
3721768	3724633	I mean, like Little Nightmares, but...
3724799	3725901	Traumatizing, I guess.
3727042	3729065	We have Fate Keeper that looks pretty awesome.
3729125	3732309	Kind of an Elder Scrolls type RPG game.
3733070	3733711	First person.
3733952	3737076	It almost looks like they mixed a little bit of Souls-like into it as well.
3737897	3738498	Very interested.
3738618	3739119	Check that out.
3739299	3741642	And then, of course, Darksiders 4.
3743264	3745187	That should be pretty incredible as well.
3746247	3747248	That's a lot of stuff.
3747749	3756239	Fate Keeper looks interesting, Re-Animal, and I think the Eternal Life of Goldman are ones I'd be checking out.
3756259	3767352	We mentioned a few games in there coming to Game Pass pretty soon, and as we know, Game Pass has been having a lot of big hits that have made its way to Game Pass lately, and Game Pass is making money.
3768333	3773139	Apparently in the latest fiscal year, Game Pass hit $5 billion in revenue.
3773199	3775441	That's 500 million active users.
3775481	3776102	That's pretty
3776082	3777884	Wild, actually.
3778065	3782390	That's a whole revenue from Microsoft of $76.4 billion.
3782410	3785073	That's up 18% over last year.
3785954	3793364	Of course, this all is coming after the fact that Microsoft has laid off a shitload of people, which is really unfortunate.
3794385	3795507	So I don't know.
3795587	3799812	It kind of makes this news kind of fucked up, honestly.
3799832	3802535	That like, look at all this money Game Pass is making.
3802596	3803777	So we had to let people go.
3805816	3813767	There is a form that they file called a 10K that talks about how the money is coming out of Microsoft.
3814207	3827004	So they've added another $2 billion on gaming revenue, and this is being credited to growth in Xbox content and services and offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.
3827665	3833713	Even though console sales have fallen 25%, Microsoft is seeing increases from gaming.
3833693	3840565	And of course, you know, it should be noted that is coming alongside the news that they canceled game project.
3840605	3842928	They laid off people that were working on games.
3842949	3844271	These are things to keep in mind.
3845974	3854588	However, in their statement, they do say we continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators.
3854568	3863362	These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first and third party titles.
3863382	3866186	Of course, they're not going to tell you about all the stuff they canceled and closed.
3866426	3869371	That's what we're here to do to remind you.
3869611	3878685	Anyway, it is, again, an interesting sort of side by side that is kind of fucked up, but...
3879661	3881403	We'll see, I guess, where this leads.
3881503	3891916	I mean, as frustrating as all this news is about the layoffs and the canceled game projects, it's hard to deny that Game Pass is on fire right now, which is what Microsoft wants.
3892436	3896081	So it could be interesting for what will be in the future for Game Pass.
3896141	3901387	It just kind of sucks that certain projects that were in Game Pass's future will no longer be coming.
3901407	3905612	But I guess these numbers are maybe making Microsoft feel that they aren't needed.
3906113	3907635	Who knows?
3907655	3907795	Mm-hmm.
3908838	3919303	Let's get to the bumper.
3929628	3937074	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3937515	3939823	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
3940428	3943531	Except Jamie is not going to do it tonight because she's not here.
3943551	3945573	But you know who is here is Loki.
3946054	3949618	And it's Loki's turn to pick a classic game of the week.
3949638	3949998	That's right.
3950038	3951399	It's really overdue.
3952020	3953542	But we had enough notice this time.
3953882	3955724	So Loki was able to pick.
3955744	3959648	And all I can say about this pick is it is something I am not surprised at all.
3959668	3962932	I'm more surprised that this game is 10 years old than the fact that Loki picked it.
3962952	3965534	It is the greatest of all time.
3966976	3968157	It's Goat Simulator.
3969217	3988069	Thank you for watching!
3988049	3998960	And of course, as with that, they released the trailer kind of showing off some of the stupid things that they were doing with this concept.
3998980	4001727	And everyone's like, I need this now.
4001747	4003392	And they're like, oh, okay, well...
4004452	4024806	Not the Goat Mayhem.
4026305	4032213	Yeah, it's kind of like a Tony Hawk Pro Skater type scoring system with that.
4032233	4041726	So basically you play a goat named Pilgor and you are in charge of making everybody's lives miserable.
4042167	4046593	You have a giant tongue that you can stick the things and pull things around.
4046973	4048696	You can bounce off of stuff.
4048716	4049897	You can crash into things.
4049917	4051840	You can explode and ragdoll.
4051820	4053022	All sorts of craziness.
4053462	4058269	And then throughout the game, of course, you can unlock different mutators that give you different powers.
4058730	4066761	So some of those, of course, there's a demon goat, which causes these goats to fall from the sky.
4068323	4071427	You can get different animals you can play as.
4071467	4072629	They're all called goats.
4072729	4077335	So, for example, there's Tall Goat, which is just a giraffe.
4077355	4079278	There's...
4079613	4082499	The Ostrich, which I think is like the feathered goat.
4082679	4084303	They have another one that's a whale.
4084864	4086387	It's ridiculous.
4086407	4089754	But it kept going on and on.
4089774	4093642	They kept adding different expansions to it as well.
4094223	4098111	So they did everything from...
4098513	4106293	releasing like a Skyrim type piece of content that you can play.
4106313	4109341	It's like the RPG simulator thing where you can be a microwave.
4109601	4111105	Can you Fus Ro Dah with a goat?
4111709	4112911	Yes, you can.
4112931	4113191	Amazing.
4113371	4115855	Yes, that's actually one of them that's in there that you can get.
4116255	4118118	That's in the Vanilla game, actually.
4118158	4119299	You can get that mutator.
4120321	4123345	They had, was it the Queen of Goats?
4125067	4127811	They had a Sonic the Hedgehog spin thing that you could do.
4127831	4133599	I remember there was one that was like a Yoshi mutator that you could eat things and then make eggs.
4134500	4135621	There's lots of crazy stuff.
4135681	4136923	Jetpacks.
4136903	4142494	Um, but it was a fun game where there's lots of collectibles, lots of, like, stuff to try to compete.
4143456	4145680	Um, and it was buggy.
4145700	4149427	It was extremely buggy and crashed a lot.
4149868	4157443	But thankfully, they just recently remade that, so you can check out the remake, which came out last November, but...
4157423	4163949	I'd highly recommend playing that version over the original because the original very, very, very, very buggy.
4164110	4166992	It was very easy to break that game.
4167273	4168774	But very fun.
4169175	4170816	And I highly recommend you check it out.
4171176	4173939	Also, of course, their second game, Goat Simulator 3.
4173979	4174440	Yes, I know.
4174520	4175661	The joke is there isn't a 2.
4176642	4177843	That is out as well.
4178023	4180526	They had a big expansion that they put out for it.
4180546	4184309	And there's another expansion for that coming very soon as well.
4184349	4185971	So we'll have to look forward to that.
4186472	4186992	But yeah.
4186972	4189796	Classic game of the week, Goat Simulator.
4189816	4193280	You sound so giddy to finally be able to add that one to the list.
4193420	4194101	Of course.
4194382	4195483	It's great.
4195583	4196985	It is such a good game.
4197025	4199568	I have wasted a lot of time in that.
4199588	4205216	And the best part about the original one on Steam has Steam Workshop support.
4205556	4206177	Oh, there you go.
4206738	4208780	What makes a buggy game even better?
4209041	4209561	Mods.
4210823	4211103	Good times.
4211123	4211784	Tons of mods.
4212064	4213266	Tons of mods.
4213718	4215600	Oh my god, Alan loves mods too.
4215620	4216661	I was watching him mod.
4216681	4218784	What was he modding this last week?
4219565	4220926	It might have actually been Skyrim.
4220946	4224030	I think he's back on that now that we got the new video cards.
4224070	4226292	And so it's like, I want to throw all the things at Skyrim.
4226833	4228755	So, good times.
4228795	4234362	Did you know, because someone brought up, oh, aka the Asshole Goat game.
4234402	4241410	Did you know that the Untitled Goose game was going to have an animated series?
4241430	4243472	They even did a pilot for it
4243452	4244514	It was great.
4244594	4247358	Like, I really wish they had gone through with it.
4247578	4248620	Is it on YouTube or something?
4249221	4250843	It is on YouTube, yeah.
4251424	4254408	There's a lot of pilots on YouTube that are fun.
4254428	4258895	The Elvira TV show has a pilot on YouTube.
4259235	4260998	It is really funny, actually.
4261078	4264784	So I really wish that there was the Untitled Goose thing.
4264924	4269190	Hopefully we'll get a new Untitled Goose game at some point, but...
4269507	4271351	Yeah, it was really good.
4271371	4273696	I'm trying to think of what other random ass pilots I've seen on YouTube.
4273857	4278908	I saw the absolutely fabulous American version because I did not realize that what's her name?
4278948	4282015	Catherine Han from...
4282957	4287141	Wanda, Agatha, Agatha Long, WandaVision.
4287261	4290785	Agatha Long was in that with Kristen Johnston.
4290825	4292987	I did not realize it was her in the American pilot, but it was bad.
4293007	4294629	It was not because of her.
4294709	4297232	It was just, that's a very hard thing to Americanize.
4298012	4302157	And then I saw a pilot for, you know, Clarissa Explains It All.
4302177	4303778	Did you know they were going to turn that?
4304139	4308323	Like they were going to do like a Clarissa is an adult ABC series?
4308303	4333112	Yeah, I remember that.
4333092	4335975	Yeah, all this chat, SJ100Mass says, I remember that series.
4336236	4337117	It's all on YouTube.
4337217	4341782	All those pilots are there, unless they finally copyrighted them down, but I don't think so.
4341802	4343764	There's a lot of pilots and things you can find on YouTube.
4344465	4359243	I went on a YouTube rabbit hole this week, and there was some internet commentators that were making fun of it, but apparently Six Flags tried to do their own 90s show.
4359523	4359623	Yeah.
4360413	4363898	is the cringiest thing I've ever seen.
4363938	4370168	It's like an MTV News type thing, but just it's so bad.
4370188	4370969	It's so bad.
4371089	4374915	Fifth Dream in chat says, two words, American Red Dwarf pilot.
4374935	4376116	That's four words, Fifth Dream.
4376697	4378280	I'll do you one worse.
4378901	4383167	American IT crowd remake.
4383187	4384629	Even Joel McHale couldn't save that.
4384649	4385310	It was so bad.
4385811	4386512	It was so bad.
4386532	4388735	Anyway, Loki.
4388755	4389516	A rapid fire answer.
4389536	4389897	All right.
4390771	4393954	Yeah, Peak just got a recent update.
4393994	4397078	So Peak is that kind of mountain climbing co-op game.
4397898	4405947	But to be silly, because it is a mountain climbing survival game, you're supposed to be like a troop of like Boy Scouts or whatever.
4407829	4410131	So they put out a release.
4410532	4412974	It's like, hey guys, totally normal update to the game.
4413354	4414295	Nothing to see here.
4414536	4416778	And then one of the...
4416758	4420264	The list of changes is added cannibalism.
4420364	4428317	So now apparently if you are your stamina is just, you know, pretty empty, you're going to start hallucinating.
4428537	4436110	And so you'll do the whole Looney Tunes thing where the other players start looking like walking like pieces of meat or chicken or something like that.
4437272	4440657	And you can eat them and you get all your stamina back.
4442189	4445493	This is so disgusting but funny.
4445513	4446214	It's hilarious.
4446755	4451702	But yeah, so, yes, as if players, they start hallucinating.
4451722	4452463	I need to get on this.
4452563	4453925	I need to buy this Peek game.
4453945	4454165	It's fun.
4454345	4455607	It really is a fun game.
4455787	4456929	Who do I want to play Peek with?
4456989	4460593	Bobby Blackwolf for sure because he'll get so frustrated.
4460613	4462336	He'll rage quit.
4462356	4463337	Um...
4463317	4464900	Who else do I want to play Peak with?
4465080	4465421	I don't know.
4465481	4468526	I need some... Oh, if Extifer is willing to play.
4468567	4470871	I need people that scream when they play their video games.
4471412	4475619	So maybe Extifer would be a good one if he's willing to make a return to the internet.
4476541	4477262	It's tricky.
4477463	4482792	It does get pretty hard, but it is funny trying to help your friends and then stuff goes wrong, obviously.
4483674	4483834	Yeah.
4485117	4485898	Good times.
4486351	4515413	and then along with that other great news kind of just shadow dropped but Mario Paint made it out onto the Nintendo Switch Online SNES library it is on both the Switch and Switch 2 what is unique about this though is on the Switch 2 obviously it uses the mouse support that the Joy-Cons can do on the Switch 1 you have to use a USB mouse
4515680	4518005	So you actually plug in a USB mouse into that.
4518185	4522453	I wonder if there's more games that support mouse controls using a USB mouse.
4522854	4524237	It's funny you say that.
4524297	4526240	They did add it to other games later in the week.
4526361	4528625	It might not be in whatever you're looking at, but they did.
4528645	4532152	Remember how they had put out a few things like Nobunaga's Ambition on Super Nintendo?
4532172	4533174	They put out a few games.
4533194	4534897	They did add it for those games too.
4535198	4535779	Oh, nice.
4535799	4536861	That came later in the week.
4537651	4540434	Yeah, so yeah, you can play Mario Paint.
4540454	4542075	So here's my question for you, Loki.
4542095	4547180	I know you love this Rob Stradamus meme we have here in the show that the chat has going about these predictions that I make.
4547600	4556008	Now, I did say that Mario Paint, I did say it would be a good launch title, like a new Mario Paint would be a good packing game.
4556328	4563174	But I did say as part of that, that Mario Paint should come out on the Switch, you know, Nintendo Switch Online.
4563554	4567658	Do I get credit when it's six minutes, or not six minutes, six weeks past
4567638	4569021	The Switch's launch?
4569081	4569763	I think so.
4569883	4572449	Yeah, I think it's still close enough.
4573131	4578083	Honestly, it feels like they should be making a second Mario Paint game.
4578143	4579887	I could see a Switch 2 Mario Paint.
4580168	4582373	I know, it seems like such an obvious thing.
4582943	4589655	If they do end up announcing one for next year, I'm taking the full point, even if I miss the launch.
4589675	4590016	That's right.
4590036	4592681	PodCulture says it's still the launch window.
4593081	4594284	Good point, PodCulture.
4594344	4594905	Good point.
4595326	4595726	You're right.
4595766	4598852	You just watch my wording next time.
4598872	4599794	I think it's close enough.
4599834	4601296	I mean, what, a month out?
4601336	4602959	I'll take the point.
4603280	4606065	Rob has gained one point in ego.
4607193	4607513	All right.
4607593	4613601	I mean, and if you think about it, what it's only been two weeks since the whole Donkey Kong game came out.
4613841	4617065	And technically that was advertised as kind of a launch window game.
4617085	4619348	So like it's not too far out.
4619428	4621551	I think we love to move the goalposts.
4621791	4623032	Absolutely.
4623052	4623373	All right.
4623994	4624314	Let's see.
4624374	4625395	What did I want to talk about?
4625415	4627458	Oh, how about PlayStation Plus games?
4628259	4631783	If you are a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you know, you get free games every month.
4631982	4635287	So what are you getting starting August 5th for the months of August?
4635307	4637751	You're getting DayZ on PlayStation 4.
4637891	4638572	You know this one.
4638612	4639534	Survival games.
4639934	4644702	60 players have to endure together, you know, except there's zombies and stuff.
4644722	4648347	So be careful because there are no checkpoints and no save points.
4648407	4649829	When you die, you are dead.
4649849	4650210	The end.
4650731	4654176	Speaking of bang your head against the wall, difficult...
4654156	4659023	Grind Games, Lies of P for PlayStation 5 and 4 is also coming.
4659204	4661027	You know you love Souls-like games, right?
4661407	4665373	Enjoy Lies of P for free with your PlayStation Plus subscription.
4665393	4672184	And then we also have, if you want something a little bit, I guess, on the lighter side, My Hero 1's Justice 2 for the PlayStation 4.
4672905	4682880	This is, of course, the follow-up to the Arena Fighter, My Hero 1's Justice, and you get character quirks and you go head-to-head in battles in big arenas.
4682860	4710914	so check that out or just don't forget to add them to your library and you know just an FYI that means last month's games are almost out the door so if you've not yet added like Diablo 4 was is one of the games for this month if you did not yet add those to your library you're literally on your last chance get on that before Tuesday so all right well if the PlayStation Plus games aren't of interest to you maybe you can go buy yourself a new game let's check out world release dates Loki what's coming out in the U.S.
4710934	4711635	this week
4711733	4713376	Not a ton this week.

4732046	4736273	Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch 2, as we talked about earlier.
4736253	4754464	Hello Kitty Island Adventure on PlayStation 5 and then this is going to be the segment where I once again recommend highly highly highly recommend that you pick this game up on any platform because I think it is also on other console platforms as well Turbo Kid on Nintendo Switch I thought you meant the other one
4754444	4755586	I thought you meant Hello Kitty.
4755746	4757068	I thought you were endorsing Hello Kitty.
4757128	4758349	I was like, fuck yeah.
4758369	4760252	Fuck yeah, Loki plus Hello Kitty forever.
4760953	4764438	I mean, I'm sure that game's good too, but no, I'm talking about Turbo Kid.
4764458	4773790	Turbo Kid is a Metroidvania game based off of the cult film Turbo Kid, which is like an 80s post-apocalyptic movie with BMX bikes and stuff.
4773811	4775393	Such a good game.
4775413	4776935	It really is.
4776955	4777836	Nice.

4911504	4914129	Gradius Origin Collection also making its way.

4921080	4923724	So Gradius Origin Collection is on its way to PlayStation 5.

4973279	4975241	And then, UK?
4975502	4976944	No, because we still haven't finished Japan.
4978025	4979427	You cut me off, Loki.
4979447	4980168	That's fine.
4980288	4982290	Just a few more on PlayStation 5 in Japan, and then we're done.
4982851	4988859	Robocop, Rogue City, Unfinished Business, Basureros is out in a regular and limited edition.

5024191	5026134	Any interest in that mafia, the old country?
5026234	5026835	It looks a little weird.
5026875	5028498	I haven't really played the mafia game.
5028558	5032764	I'm not into Grand Theft Auto period peace games.
5033365	5034747	It's kind of what that is, right?
5035128	5035869	I know.
5036070	5037251	I need modern Grand Theft Auto.
5037652	5046606	I feel like if somebody would take that idea and lean into it and take it one step forward to a comedy type of thing like a Grand Theft Auto, which I guess maybe is Red Dead Redemption.
5047928	5048349	Maybe.
5048369	5049410	Yeah, yeah.
5049470	5052375	They also have, was it, there was like, uh...
5052929	5055813	Grand Theft Horse or something like that was one.
5055833	5057155	It was a GOG game.
5057196	5058437	How about Grand Theft Amish?
5058638	5059960	That's what I'm looking for.
5060180	5060921	Grand Theft Amish?
5061061	5061322	Yeah.
5061903	5062464	I'd like that.
5062484	5063024	Maybe.
5063044	5063365	All right.
5063385	5063625	Anyway.
5065148	5068092	Well, how about games that are taking a long time to develop?
5068112	5070656	And when our last story here before we get to the listener roundtable, Loki?
5071397	5072259	Yeah, Bioshock.
5072880	5077146	That's a series that we haven't seen anything from in a long time.
5077667	5081012	Apparently, they are working on Bioshock 4.
5081414	5107911	Maybe, apparently it's been restarted a few times with different game engines But yeah, 12 years since the last Bioshock game And apparently Bioshock 4 has been in development since even before that came out Yeah, I'm trying to remember what it said It's been like 15 years that they've been working on this essentially Because the development on this new game started before Infinite came out
5108380	5119993	But yeah, now, of course, though, because of that, they're saying that there's been some, you know, the Bioshock failed to review by executives the new game.
5120153	5130183	And then also that there's been layoffs with the developers that have been working on it as well, so they can be more agile and efficient.
5131505	5134388	Yeah, you got to be agile when you're down people, I guess.
5134773	5154030	that game has taken a long time to cook though it has taken a long time I kind of forgot that they're doing stuff there's other Ken Levine games though if I remember correctly there's that one that was in space when did that ever did that ever come out I don't think it did I honestly don't remember yeah so
5154820	5183292	Alright, well let's go to the listener roundtable where you all can interact with our show every week You can send us emails over at participate at orangeloungeradio.com You can also send us messages on BlueSky You can follow us on BlueSky at orangeloungeradio.com We are verified by domain over on BlueSky I don't think we got anything this last week on BlueSky, no we didn't So, you know, maybe that's just a sign I need to post more, I don't know But yeah, check that out
5183272	5185580	I'm going to open up the mailbag here.
5185740	5189132	I don't think we had anything, Loki, but I'm just going to verify that.
5189152	5192182	If you wouldn't mind, do you have any last-minute stories to throw at us while I pull up the mailbag?
5192804	5194108	Since we're down a person tonight.
5195084	5203758	Yeah, I mean, I don't think we have any other last minute news, but certainly I'm curious to see.
5204579	5207443	We're like should be not that far away from Gamescom.
5207483	5209066	I think that's like within a week or two.
5209346	5210268	So it's real soon.
5210288	5211009	Yeah, it's right after.
5211169	5213453	It's right after Evo, I think so.
5214274	5217599	So like we should be seeing some more news coming out here pretty soon.
5217679	5219903	August 20th to 24th is Gamescom.
5219923	5221986	OK, so a few more weeks, I guess.
5221966	5244733	but yeah expecting to hear some more news regarding that stuff um be curious to see whether games are coming like honestly like uh I don't even know what the fourth quarter looks like right now I know that this year we've got was it Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty and you know some other mainline uh temple titles and stuff but I'd be curious to see how those all do
5244983	5274568	The timing of Gamescom reminded me I have not yet plugged DragonCon yet on tonight's show I've been pretty good about pumping that up but just one more reminder I will be at DragonCon out in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend so DragonCon runs from officially it runs from August 28th Thursday through September 1st Monday but unofficially Wednesday's the new Thursday and some people stay around later too so I'm looking forward to being a part of the show again this year
5274548	5293245	My lineup is still being finalized at the show, but the only thing that I know that is on lock is that Thursday night, and I think it was 7.30, but don't quote me on that time, we are going to be having a content creator mixer, and that is in the digital media room in the basement of the Hilton where the digital media events almost always are.
5293305	5293986	Galleria 6.
5294106	5295187	Very easy to find.
5295207	5297288	You just go to the bottom of the escalator and it's right there.
5297308	5299030	And we're going to be having a content... Thank you, Bobby.
5299050	5299771	It's 7 p.m.
5300511	5302833	We'll be having the content creator mixer down there at 7.
5303034	5304555	I'm expecting it to be bigger this year.
5304535	5320570	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma
5320550	5347080	content creator mixer meet your next collaborator to try to like really entice because we want that's actually what we want it isn't to put ourselves out there I mean sure our business cards and flyers will be in the lobby but we want to invite people to come in meet people learn about platforms other than their own that's the thing I get out of it I love talking to YouTubers because I don't do enough on YouTube and I really love talking to TikTokers
5347060	5350927	because I've been consuming more TikTok, but I haven't been really creating a lot of it.
5351268	5353592	And I'm still kind of trying to find my rhythm with TikTok.
5353612	5361167	So yeah, I'd be interested in mingling with people that work in different areas than necessarily Twitch.
5361187	5364874	Not that I'm opposed to meeting Twitch streamers too, but just to like hear about that stuff.
5364894	5367639	So yeah, meet, connect, and network.
5367659	5369743	That is absolutely it.
5369808	5373452	Bobby Blackwell says, I keep worrying that once I get good at TikTok, it'll be gone.
5374252	5386584	The skills are adaptable to Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, which honestly, any content you make for TikTok ought to go on those two platforms as well before somebody copy pastes it over there if you ever get something viral.
5387665	5394272	So I think part of the trick with the short videos is you have to take a multi-platform approach almost.
5394992	5395613	But...
5395897	5397320	So we'll see.
5397340	5397600	We'll see.
5397620	5401067	Maybe that's something we're going to talk about on some of the panels this year over at DragonCon.
5401148	5402971	So really excited about that.
5403031	5405496	I can confirm I am involved with main programming.
5405857	5407801	I cannot confirm what that's going to mean yet.
5407921	5411408	So I won't know until the app releases.
5411969	5413753	And that is maybe that.
5413733	5435775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5436447	5440355	Speaking of different modalities, Loki would love more YouTube viewers.
5440375	5440976	So keep that up.
5440997	5443001	Of course, always.
5443021	5443963	Over at LokiOLR.
5446388	5448071	But you don't do the TikTok thing, right?
5449154	5451739	Nah, I've tried a few and they just don't take off.
5452647	5454892	I'm trying to still figure out the right way to do it.
5454952	5461085	But then short form, I've done long form because I was like, oh, you know, some of these, they like long.
5461586	5468259	For them, it's almost like long form is kind of like YouTube shorts in the sense that it's like different, but you could put stuff over there.
5469442	5471466	Yeah, nothing to get confused, so...
5471918	5491615	you know I have been consuming more TikTok lately and I bet I'll name a couple creators that I bet some of you in chat will pick up on and it does relate to some of the stories we talked about tonight since we don't have a lot of other comments I'll just kind of go on this tangent is that that Switch story about the inflated Switch prices Aaron Parnas actually did a
5491595	5494898	TikTok on that, which is the breaking news guy, right?
5495238	5500683	So if you're ever scrolling through TikTok for you, Paige, and you ever get that young kid that's always like, we got some breaking news here out of Washington.
5501884	5504026	So that crossed his feed.
5505387	5514996	So that kind of shows, because I think it's one of the first major companies that has announced that they're doing tariffs or what the impact is actually going to be.
5515617	5519100	So Rimari says, I don't like TikTok because it's such a noisy app.
5519340	5519941	I get that.
5519961	5521602	I actually, I get that.
5521582	5529072	and I'm not sure I can sit here and say there's an easy alternative in YouTube or no, they're all just as noisy.
5529092	5531015	So I don't know.
5531395	5535801	Could you get something that might be a little more calm?
5536983	5542811	And I'm not saying that like I know people that love to watch ASMR videos, but I feel like you've said you're not a fan of those either.
5542951	5543572	I could be wrong.
5544213	5548939	But see, sometimes I will also open TikTok
5549459	5561171	I'll open up TikTok and it will be this beautiful ocean view with the beach and it'll have this really uplifting sound that's playing like a happy little Enya song.
5561191	5562753	Sail away, sail away.
5562973	5569660	And the little caption on it says this and waking up to the headline that he died.
5569680	5570361	It doesn't say who.
5571622	5572263	You all know who.
5573544	5574505	But just to be clear.
5575902	5577329	It's not saying who.
5577349	5579741	And we can neither confirm nor deny who.
5579761	5582655	But your instinct is probably correct.
5583935	5585979	So that is a thing.
5585999	5593492	So if you allow the TikTok algorithm to sort of fall down that rabbit hole, you can get those uplifting sort of messages.
5593813	5594835	It's a hard thing to do, though.
5594895	5596057	It is.
5596918	5598962	So yeah, Aaron Parnas covered the Switch thing.
5598982	5601787	And then what I thought was interesting, this is an interesting creator.
5601847	5603911	I think their name is SilentMiddleChild.
5603991	5607377	I'm curious if any of you have ever seen this creator because they seem to get a lot of views.
5607357	5614734	and there'll be a girl in the background that you never see that'll be like, hey, Anthony, tell me about this particular type.
5614854	5618162	And it's this guy that's very, he sits there and he's playing video games.
5618182	5620166	Like it looks like he's playing Fortnite.
5620186	5624877	And while he's playing Fortnite, he just effortlessly explains
5624857	5642393	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5642373	5663183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5663163	5665486	This is a big enough headline.
5665706	5671773	It's showing up on the massive TikTok creator accounts and becoming content for them to explain as well.
5672254	5675357	So I thought that was really interesting.
5675377	5678101	So, and I actually think that's like legit.
5678121	5680523	That guy does a very good job explaining things.
5680543	5683327	I'm almost, and SSJ100Matt says, I still never download TikTok.
5683367	5684468	I just scroll reels on Insta.
5684889	5690335	I guarantee both of these creators have shown up on Insta and YouTube, whether it's official or not.
5691749	5696836	Again, if you don't copy your content and put it over there, somebody else will.
5696856	5703686	So, yeah, I would assume you've seen that guy on some platform at some point.
5703706	5707952	If you consume that stuff at all, if you don't spend enough time consuming that crap, then maybe you haven't.
5709034	5713000	So, anyway, I guess that's it.
5713020	5714161	I don't really have a lot else to say.
5714221	5717126	I think I've gone on a tangent enough and we don't have any last minute stories.
5717146	5718207	So that means we wrap it up.
5718508	5718888	We're done.
5719629	5720811	Get the hell out.
5720791	5724115	Alright, well then, let's get final thoughts.
5724155	5726939	But first, I'm going to say thank you as always for downloading our show.
5726959	5729723	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, help us spread the word.
5730023	5734209	Tell a friend or two, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
5734609	5742199	A site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, a nice five-star review, a comment, a like, all that stuff goes an awful long way.
5742219	5745604	I know you get sick of hearing creators say it, but they say it for a reason.
5745624	5746645	It really does help.
5746665	5748047	We don't ask for your money here.
5748027	5752393	But a like can do more than throwing us, you know, a dollar, to be honest.
5752413	5754817	So please do that.
5754837	5757901	Oh, and I do see Dark Tetsuya has now shouted it out twice in chat.
5757921	5769057	And I meant to say something, sorry, saying I have to shout out Earthion that just dropped on Steam, Yuzo Koshiro, and Ancient's new Genesis shmup also drops on consoles next month.
5769037	5769999	There you go, DarkSakura.
5770019	5771401	Sorry, I meant to give you a plug a minute ago.
5771441	5774447	I want to check that out as well.
5774467	5774928	Let's see.
5775048	5775849	Yeah, spread the word.
5776431	5777693	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5777733	5778915	We need more voices to put out on air.
5779256	5779997	I think I said it all.
5780258	5781700	So final thoughts then.
5781720	5783604	No Jamie tonight, but she'll be back next week.
5783944	5787431	That means no Jamie streaming after the show tonight, but I believe somebody else is going to.
5787491	5789534	So stick with us for those of you that are listening live.
5790596	5792580	Loki, we'll go to you for your final thought.
5793117	5796422	Once again, I'm still hoping that I get my data pack done.
5796983	5800849	I was hoping to have it done last week, but I don't know.
5800889	5801770	Progress is being made.
5801810	5803293	It's just taking forever.
5803873	5806337	Alright, you got this.
5806477	5815311	My final thought tonight is I hate technical glitches, but I love Final Fantasy XI, and I love other games too, and I'm going to play more of them this week.
5815291	5817293	Alright, so that's it.
5817313	5817814	We're out of here.
5817854	5818715	Have a great night everybody.
5818735	5819756	Thank you so much for watching.
5819776	5821859	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5821879	5823300	We'll be back next week.
5823340	5833071	Hopefully Jamie will be with us and thank you all for your participation tonight whether online with us here in chat as we're live or on the podcast feed.
5833151	5833632	Appreciate you.
5833812	5833992	Bye.
