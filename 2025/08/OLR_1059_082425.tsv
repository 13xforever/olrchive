9734	15319	Overwatch 2 consoles cross-play segment stats and player pools based off the use of a controller or keyboard and mouse.
15499	24087	When I played Rocket League Sideswipe, I frequently wondered how many people thought I was cheating, because I could manipulate my car faster and more precisely using an analog stick instead of touching the screen alone.
24188	27350	Though this was getting through the starter tiers, where all matter of excuses fly.
27451	28472	My body was ready.
28492	28992	No Johns.
29112	29673	Let's fly.
29813	31695	It's the most wunderbar Deutsche Zeit of the year.
31715	35658	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this week's gaming news.
35818	38661	Starting right now on the show, wherever gamers have voice...
40328	43233	Jason, you're not cheating.
43895	59063	You're just really good at the video game.
59043	60926	and 59 of our program.
61847	66593	Interesting with the scheduling is that we were off last week and we'll be off next week.
66613	68976	So this is this is an island show.
69257	72081	August is just a busy month, but we'll get into more of that in just a little bit.
72101	75746	I'll tell you all about the scheduling and why some pretty awesome reasons.
75766	76807	My name is Rob Roberts.
76827	77748	I'm here with you every week.
77788	81914	And my co-host couldn't do it without the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
82194	82395	Hello.
82415	82755	Hello.
83396	85259	Lynn's in the live stream.
85279	86721	That is what we are.
87141	87241	Hi.
87802	87902	Hi.
87962	88543	How are you?
89688	90509	I have lasagna.
90970	91932	Everything else is irrelevant.
92092	95338	Oh man, I don't have lasagna, but I do have coffee.
96801	97682	I have that too.
98464	99746	Oh, coffee and lasagna.
99786	100587	What a great combo.
101028	102491	Well, I'm not drinking the coffee right now.
103873	104074	No.
104795	107860	That's if it was ladyfingers and coffee cream.
108602	110485	Which tiramisu is my favorite dessert.
111907	113350	Next to Boston cream pie.
113482	115125	I got me thinking about desserts.
115305	122736	This is a Stouffer's lasagna because we are trying to eat all the stuff in the freezer.
122757	125040	You got me thinking about desserts now and that's not a good thing.
125060	128506	I was going like, remember all that weight I was going to lose before DragonCon?
129106	134595	For the record, my coffee is drunken out of a Michael Myers mug that says Slay All Day.
136381	136822	Perfect.
136922	145074	And now it's that season because the week before Labor Day is when Starbucks and obviously various other companies too really dunk in.
145114	149080	I think I just got a pumpkin drink at Dutch Bros and say pumpkin season is here.
149201	149481	What?
150422	150623	What?
151164	152005	You've been to my house.
152085	153727	When is it never not scary season?
155029	155690	Good point.
155710	157393	It is not pumpkin season.
159331	161213	It's David S. Pumpkin's season.
161233	162235	David S. Pumpkin's season.
163216	166020	Say hello to the one and only, our own version of David S. Pumpkin's.
166040	167161	I don't know why he doesn't wear the suit.
167201	168443	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
169004	170746	Because I'm too fat for the suit.
170946	171907	I bought the suit.
172067	173009	I have the suit.
173389	174170	I thought you did.
174190	175532	It doesn't fit.
175552	176293	It just doesn't fit.
176473	180038	Well, to be fair, it didn't fit when I bought it either.
180458	184383	Because you can't really gauge the size of those things.
184584	185625	It's just...
185605	191572	And if you bought it online, it probably came from another country where the sizing doesn't always line up.
191872	194275	So, because I've had that problem a lot.
194295	201304	I bought it in person last year at the... Well, the building's torn down now.
201384	207952	But, you know, the husk of what is now a Spirit Halloween store.
207972	210735	You know, they tend to...
210715	225200	Be Parasitic with all the different empty buildings, but yes, I bought it at a Spirit Halloween and I intended to wear it, it just doesn't, it wasn't, it just felt really cheap and it was also not fitting really well.
225220	230729	But that's kind of normal with anything that like you buy from there, it's not always going to fit.
230749	233053	There's a lot of like, oh yeah, one size fits all.
233754	234175	Sure.
235201	235962	Let's see.
236383	249522	Now there's food chat in our chat because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at – well, almost every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show over at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
249542	251946	And there's lots of great programming you can check out on VOG.
252046	253929	I hope you all remember it's not just us and Bobby.
253949	257595	We have other video gaming shows such as GameBooey.org, Video Game Podcast.
257695	258576	Love those guys.
258556	261360	We have shows about anime, Anime Jam Session.
261380	264244	We have British television connoisseurs over British Invaders.
264544	267488	And we hope you'll check out all those great shows, especially on weeks where we're not here.
267529	269812	You have plenty of other cool little things to check out.
270713	277943	So going to our chat, because we are live, PodCulture says, I thought of Rob the other day because Costco had pallets of Starbucks pumpkin spice lattes.
278264	281608	I'm kind of surprised that Alan didn't text me a picture of that.
281628	282910	But here's the thing.
282890	289178	and I've been very open about, I'm a type 2 diabetic, so I have to watch things like how many carbs and the sugars.
289559	292823	So in reality, a Costco pallet of that is a bad idea.
293284	305320	I will usually, these days, ever since the diagnosis, I will allow myself one celebratory pumpkin spice latte the week of DragonCon, usually on the way to DragonCon, but I might do it on Tuesday because our coworkers are talking about doing something.
305420	309606	And you can, when you order it, you can do something, you know, customize it so I get...
309586	314757	I get half the sweetener in it, so it's a little less than normal.
314777	317864	Because there is no sugar-free pumpkin at Starbucks.
318145	326042	Why not just get sugar-free pumpkin spice syrup, which I find all the time at home goods in those places?
326022	346528	and make it at home.
346508	352539	SSH100 Matt says they have the New York State Fair and I've eaten a lot of insane snacks.
353020	358550	Giant mozzarella stick rolled in fruity pebbles and another rolled in flaming hot Cheetos.
358570	363859	We just had the State Fair here in California and all I heard about was how fucking expensive it was for that kind of stuff.
363879	364180	It's expensive.
364160	390572	Thanks for watching!
391835	398037	Yeah, but they have like something that my son was describing like it was like a deep fried Twinkie hamburger or something like that.
398078	402534	I'm like, no, like you've gone too far at that point.
402594	403718	Like it's like...
404508	407112	If they make a Twinkie Wiener sandwich, Weird Al will sue.
409757	410478	They may have.
410759	412542	Alright, it's not food, it's video games.
412562	428068	We're going to get into a video game talk and there was a big event that happened this week I'm going to have Loki jump into, but actually I wanted to ask you about this, DarkSakura, not to get too far into our gaming weeks, but I know you are a connoisseur yourself of Dead by Daylight, and I've been on a little bit of Dead by Hiatus, but
428048	449398	Yeah, they updated to the most...
449378	476348	recent version of unreal it's one thing to watch like nick and prince or you stream it where like it doesn't look that different to me but when i look over my husband's shoulder i'm like this looks different to me somehow i don't know what it is like i don't know if it's just the eye for the fighter details but yeah i can tell it's different but then um he was telling me well you should patch your game and sign on because they are giving away five million blood points right now which i don't know how to quantify that for people not familiar with the game but it is a
476328	478392	It's the cap of free leveling money.
478532	481056	Basically, it's it's a I'll put it this way.
482098	486025	My pig was at and don't say nice level 69.
487868	490914	Well, prestige 69, like level 20 something.
491876	500631	When I applied that 5 million directly to her in the most optimized manner, I got up to prestige 70 for level 42.
502231	506300	I got every survivor to level one that I own.
506400	508345	I don't own a few of them at this point.
508365	509568	I got every single one of them.
509668	513597	And then I actually got a couple of the killers that I never want to play just to unlock their perks.
513617	520612	So I dumped a bunch into Billy and I dumped a bunch into Trapper just to get their perks in the pool, which is nice.
520853	521775	So.
521755	538330	Why'd they do that?
539592	546501	which was an artifact on the loading screen that was part of the scaffolding holding up a street sign in the background of the lobby.
546521	548183	Oh yes, because now it's an icon, right?
548723	549164	Literally an icon.
549184	550566	I have made icons of it, yes.
551206	552568	I have icons that I made.
552588	554911	A player icon, right?
555011	557134	Yeah, you can get it as a player badge.
558676	566726	And for those who are in chat, I will just use my little emote that I made of Jim Beam.
566746	567827	Jim the Beam.
568212	571868	You can also get a shirt that says RIP Jim the Beam.
572149	573294	I made it myself.
573315	574560	Anyway, back to this.
575148	586862	So there were already things going on and they put out a fix for it and said that they were delaying more DLC to do a quality of life thing.
589506	599518	But what happened at the 2v8, now I will rewind and say that I didn't exactly experience this, but it did happen when the 2v8 event came out on October 20th.
599802	601545	There was an outage.
601786	602868	Hundreds of people couldn't play.
603309	604731	Matchmaking was having problems.
604871	605893	Game wasn't launching.
605974	606915	Login issues.
606935	607897	High latency.
608478	610121	I experienced the latency problem.
610141	614610	I played for maybe two hours and then switched to, I think, Mass Effect.
615732	620140	And for me, the biggest way I get latency is input lag.
620339	625128	I would rather just have the game be slow than have input lag.
626130	632642	Because then there's seconds where I can't control my character because she's still walking based on the last command that I put in.
634726	637892	So yeah, it was pretty crap.
638024	643913	But it was really just a massive failure of launch.
644353	647458	And this was scheduled to run from August 19th through the 2nd.
649922	651965	We're still waiting to see if they're going to extend it.
651985	663542	But as an apology to everybody, they have issued out 5 million blood points to everybody, which, as I recall, is the current cap for blood points.
663522	666894	And I said it before, you can get a lot of levels with that.
666914	672433	You can put it on so many different characters, but I'm trying to P100 my pig.
673717	674761	I've P100 Meg.
675162	676266	It's pig's turn.
677005	683919	But anyway, you have to claim this no later than September 2nd at 11 a.m.
683939	684620	Eastern Time.
687406	694620	And yeah, so they haven't said exactly what the issue was, but it did affect so much.
694640	698608	It lasted about two hours, and I felt it.
698588	715385	The other thing, though, is that if you are just thinking of coming back to Dead by Daylight, even if you don't play during this event, you can still get 50,000 blood points daily just by logging in and going into your inbox and claiming it.
715405	725214	There are also, I think, because a community thing was met, there's also some bonus badges and things that you can get for free.
725234	727937	All of it will be in your inbox in-game.
728575	729578	Nice.
729598	730440	Yeah, I logged in.
730460	732946	I haven't logged in in a while and collected a bunch of free stuff.
732966	734189	So I was like, okay, neat.
734209	735252	Maybe I'll play.
735272	739402	Maybe one of these days I will give in to DarkSakura going, Rob, play.
739964	740706	Rob, play.
740726	741067	You should play.
741388	741628	Play.
742310	743733	No, seriously.
744034	745538	You should play tomorrow.
745518	747441	No, tomorrow.
747461	747761	Tuesday.
747882	751407	Let's do after DragonCon at this point.
751747	752248	No.
752408	752729	Now.
753009	754932	What about your subby?
754952	755974	What about your subbython?
756334	759018	I think I'm here doing your next little subbython.
759038	763425	I was going to not say it live, but now that you brought it up... Oh, my bad.
764620	772771	I'm having a subathon on my channel, DarkSakuraTTV, because I'm trying to raise money for my hotel room.
773291	778498	I mean, I have enough now, but I want to make sure I have extra money in case, you know, emergencies happen.
780461	786689	But yeah, it's going to be the 13th, September 13th, which is a Saturday at 11 o'clock a.m.
786729	788331	Pacific time till 11 p.m.
788371	789032	Pacific time.
789413	792096	But you can pay me to go longer.
792194	793055	Okay.
793075	795377	I did that during your last one.
795658	796318	I did go longer.
796378	798160	Actually, Rob, I went longer than I was paid to go.
798360	801304	I opened my purse and dumped out all my bits and gave them to you.
802345	803826	I went 14 hours.
803846	804167	Nice.
804447	808571	You, too, can watch me be unintelligible at the 14-hour mark.
808952	810113	That's the longest I could play a game.
810173	812475	Well, I went longer also because Shay popped on.
813176	814317	I was like, I'm playing with Shay.
815178	816620	And you know Shay is a treasure.
816900	817881	Shay is a small treasure.
818907	821118	Alright, we gotta get into the gaming news.
821399	825198	Any other quick things for your sub-a-thon, September 13th?
826263	827027	Be there.
827682	854702	Maybe my room will be clean and I can actually use my camera.
854682	857066	and just, you know, which makes sense.
857166	861192	It's in Europe and they're eight or nine hours ahead and they're not going to do it in the middle of the night.
861212	862414	So, yeah, it's going to be early.
862794	866420	But I've got a lot of work commitments and things I have to do.
867161	871026	So I could not really follow that until later, much later in the day.
871046	872809	So I kind of had to look at the recaps.
872789	878383	I feel like when you look at the recaps, it's not as impactful as actually watching a lot of those trailers.
878404	881171	So I tried to go back and watch a few, but I will admit I didn't watch everything.
881191	884880	But Loki, what were some of the things that caught your eye?
884960	887507	What should we be aware of from Gamescom?
887791	889172	There was a lot of things.
889192	897581	There was even stuff that was in the pre-show as well that I don't think we have on this list here, but I can try to recall it from my memory.
898783	905249	So starting things off in the most randomly possible way, the announcement of Bubsy 4D.
906110	907192	I heard about that.
907292	908513	Who asked for this?
909394	911436	Oh, it's the game no one asked for.
911416	913178	But it looks cool.
913439	914260	You know who asked for it?
914280	914660	Atari.
914900	915742	Atari asked for it.
915922	918926	Because they're like, hey, those kids are playing Bubsy.
919667	921409	We need to get in on that Bubsy train.
921990	928438	I remember when little Sarah was growing up, she used to play this game called Bubsy.
928458	929880	Can we do another Bubsy?
930621	933504	We need our own mascot platformer.
933665	934566	Let's see who we got.
934866	935587	Bubsy.
936348	938571	Bubsy's got the stuff.
939800	942268	And while we're at it, let's reboot Yars Revenge again.
943553	944516	Yeah, let's do it again.
944616	945780	Let's bring back Yonoid.
945840	946382	How about that?
946763	947325	Let's do that.
948690	951379	The character that you don't have anymore, but you know.
952675	954598	Anyway, so they had that.
955018	970601	There was also a really cool trailer for Densha Attack, which is this just absolutely insane anime jet set radio looking thing where you're a train that grinds rails and flies into the air and fights things.
971102	971623	I'm down.
972043	974267	Give me that, please.
974327	975308	So that looked amazing.
975729	978733	There was some other stuff too, but I don't remember what those were.
978713	983981	Anyways, so the actual Gamescom stuff though, lots of announcements.
984021	990511	The biggest one, of course, is that, you know, Silksong still coming out this year.
990952	999405	It was then later announced in their own like direct event that it's coming out very soon, actually, in just a couple weeks.
1000313	1010347	Call of Duty Black Ops 7 has a gameplay trailer and it looks like some of the Far Cry Dream sequences and apparently this is something that was also in Black Ops 6.
1010787	1013611	I think it looks fucking stupid, but you know, that's just me.
1015033	1029072	I remember back in my day when Call of Duty was a military shooter game, not this bullshit Fortnite shit, but apparently they're going all in on bullshit Fortnite shit, so...
1029760	1030941	More power to them, I guess.
1031722	1037768	And then we had trailer for Lords of the Fallen 2, which looks awesome.
1039550	1040631	Very excited to see that.
1041792	1045396	Sekiro No Defeat looks pretty awesome.
1046798	1056848	One of the games I'm most excited about that was announced was LEGO Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is kind of a brand new Batman LEGO game, because they haven't done that in like...
1057064	1058787	God, years, over 10 years.
1059809	1066139	And what's cool about it though is it follows not only like the Arkham games, but it seems like the movies and like other stuff as well.
1066159	1074713	It's like a culmination of all of the Batman media empire, but now all together with the Lego humor and stuff.
1074733	1078179	So I am 100% down to check that out.
1078199	1078279	Um,
1079170	1104570	Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 4 we got to see a trailer for that coming out next year also a new crossover with Monster Hunter Wilds I think they did this recently with Final Fantasy 14 now it's going the other way so now you have Final Fantasy 14 stuff coming into Monster Hunter Wilds so they showed off Chocobos and stuff like that that's coming in October
1104550	1128263	We have Onimusha, The Way of the Sword Looks pretty cool, that's also set for next year We've got a trailer, which funny enough I actually saw this before I saw Opening Night Live But a trailer for Season 2 of Fallout, the TV show Looks great, I'm excited, it's supposed to be coming out in December So can't wait to see it, I will binge the hell out of that
1128243	1135377	My buddy Aria Snark saw that trailer and screencapped something and put it on her Instagram and said, this isn't a lot.
1135578	1136880	Like there's some fight going on.
1136920	1141069	It's some like building looking thing and went, this is the empty grocery store behind my house.
1142552	1145678	I just thought that was so funny.
1145658	1147803	Just LA things.
1149968	1150770	Hey, you know what?
1150830	1152675	You gotta use what you got.
1153036	1154058	I think it's funny.
1154198	1157667	I love seeing places that I know.
1157827	1161135	I love seeing things, especially when they don't make any sense.
1161115	1168470	Like, you know, the famous one I can think of is that old 90s ABC TGIF show, Step by Step.
1168891	1171016	Step by step a day, right?
1171036	1171777	The Patrick Duffy show.
1171857	1172759	Okay.
1172799	1173380	Suzanne Somers.
1173400	1173861	Okay.
1173881	1177369	So the opening of that is them all getting on a roller coaster, right?
1177830	1178972	And that roller coaster.
1178952	1195982	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1195962	1220164	so if you ever watch the opening to that show and you see the ocean roaming up against that's all fucking CGI that's the parking lot for the theme park that they just it's so funny everyone's cars are underwater the worst part about that though is it's rotoed so bad so like as you're watching the ocean like the coastline just like keeps shifting like I remember that from watching that show like how ridiculous that looked it's like
1220144	1223591	Fine, okay, this looks stupid, but okay.
1223852	1230145	Remember the great magic mountain flood of 1994, and Suzanne Somers had to row to- This is what happens, global warming, see?
1230606	1232871	Everyone's hell happy, you know, but it's-
1233323	1255095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1255075	1264495	We have an announcement for John Carpenter's Toxic Commando that's expected out early next year as well.
1264998	1270383	Death by Scrolling is a new game by Ron Gilbert.
1271043	1280672	A little bit different style of game, but it's like a roguelite where the screen is constantly scrolling and apparently the Grim Reaper is trying to kill you as well during all this.
1280692	1281933	That one looked interesting to me.
1282093	1283074	That one caught my eye.
1283214	1284175	I love the name too.
1284496	1286818	Yeah, so it looks interesting.
1288219	1295005	We had Zero Parades, I guess, which is by the developers of Disco Elysium.
1294985	1296629	And what else?
1297412	1299116	The Darkest Files.
1299136	1299878	I don't remember that.
1299898	1304631	Oh, that was the one that was, I think, like, you're like hunting Nazis or something like that.
1304651	1309063	And then they came out and talked about how Nazis are bad, which, I mean, do we really need to say that?
1309083	1310968	I guess we really do nowadays.
1311472	1335792	another trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 now it's coming out October 21st Cinder City which apparently I guess it looks like Warframe I'm not familiar it's a new MMO shooter also Time Takers some third-person shooter game we had a new trailer for Silent Hill F that's showing off the the gameplay it's
1336733	1359282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1360105	1370021	Yeah, we had La Divinia Comedia, and that looks like another Souls-like type game, so that's pretty cool.
1371123	1380739	Kronos the New Dawn, I swear the character in this reminds me of Bioshock's The Big Daddies, but yeah, it's a survival horror game, looks pretty cool.
1380899	1385286	It's also being done by Bloober Team, and that is coming out.
1385266	1390771	Ironically enough, also in September, actually September 5th, so next week.
1390871	1391715	Very exciting.
1392674	1398380	Then we have a new trailer for The Outer Worlds 2 starring Ben Schwartz.
1398900	1402784	So, you know, look for that October 29th.
1403545	1408049	Vampire of the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is going to be coming out October 21st.
1408429	1410471	And we have a new trailer for that.
1410571	1412393	Cult of the Lamb, Woolhaven.
1412874	1414475	It's a, I think, DLC.
1415036	1417518	And that's coming out next year as well.
1417718	1422563	It looks cute and culty, which I think is the point.
1422931	1428527	World of Warcraft Midnight, the 11th expansion for World of Warcraft.
1428787	1431134	Is it really the 11th?
1431395	1433561	Holy smokes.
1433581	1437953	It is coming out next year and I don't know anything about it.
1437933	1443559	This is the one that's going to bring player housing, which is a thing in Final Fantasy XIV.
1443679	1449085	There's been other MMOs that have had this as well, but World of Warcraft's kind of doing its own thing with it.
1449425	1455191	And it really sounds like they're trying to do some things differently to fix some of the bitches people have about Final Fantasy XIV's housing.
1455231	1458495	For example, you don't have to bid on lots.
1458795	1462759	Everybody can have a house if you do the quest for it and all that stuff.
1462739	1491666	and yeah that part sounds really neat and they have another system they're building into it is something called Prey the Prey system not like Holy Church but like the video game P-R-E-Y type of thing meaning the Predator and the Prey and that's actually exactly what it is is that while you're doing quests if you turn on this motor I think you have to talk to a quest keeper to do it you can actually be hunted by an NPC while you're doing quests that could come out at any time and try to get you
1491646	1495396	It sort of makes me think of like trying to play on the old PvP realms.
1495416	1497501	It really sounds like that a little bit.
1497662	1500349	So yeah, it sounds like there's some interesting new features.
1500369	1502374	I think WoW has been really good actually.
1503216	1504339	Why would I want that?
1504876	1509241	Quest Rewards, Glory, Fame, that type of thing.
1509381	1512225	No, that's not worth being jump-scared by the game.
1512245	1512585	Thank you.
1512605	1515188	But it is optional, so if you don't want it, don't do it.
1515889	1526081	And I will say WoW for me has been on an upswing ever since that really shitty expansion that made Sylvanas the main baddie.
1526101	1527062	That was a terrible expansion.
1527202	1528204	I don't even remember what it was called.
1528224	1528504	Perfector.
1528484	1535673	Yeah, it's been a lot better since Dragonflight was pretty good and this most recent one, War Within, was pretty darn good as well.
1535693	1543123	So, you know, I can't say I will stay subbed forever to World of Warcraft, but I will buy the expansion and renew my sub.
1543143	1545066	I enjoy WoW enough to play through the main story.
1546027	1549311	I might have to go back to it if I've got a guild to play in.
1549426	1552130	Yeah, I don't think I have a guild anymore.
1552411	1554233	Is it time to rebuild Danger Squad?
1555275	1555696	Maybe.
1555836	1556216	I don't know.
1556637	1559762	I don't know if the Game Boy kids are full Final Fantasy XIV.
1559782	1560884	I don't know if they're in WoW at all.
1560924	1565491	I feel like Spike and John might have tried one of these recent ones, but I could be wrong.
1565571	1566372	I could be wrong.
1567280	1584073	Mm-hmm
1584509	1606315	Project Spectrum Ghosts of Yotai
1606295	1636082	Ghosts of Yotai Legends we're showing that off that's coming out now October 2nd and we had Resident Evil Requiem a new trailer for that as well that of course is announced for February 27th next year and then the big one Black Myth Zonghui which is a brand new Black Myth game following Black Myth Wukong looks fantastic another game of the year contender probably
1636282	1636874	probably.
1637221	1638018	Yeah.
1638038	1638242	All right.
1639117	1645645	Yeah, so lots of, I think what was interesting about that, it was a lot of kind of, I don't know, for me it was a lot of games I wasn't expecting to hear about.
1646907	1655218	So yeah, it's cool, but I feel like outside of what you just talked about, the news this week was very light.
1655238	1666452	Like we made a lot of space for Gamescom and I feel like the news we got, I don't know, hasn't exactly been, you know, it filled a couple of days of buzz, but because they didn't do a lot of shadow drops, right?
1666533	1668415	Was that He-Man game shadow dropped?
1669424	1676053	That was, I don't remember, but that was also one that was shown off in the pre-show as well.
1676073	1678677	It was the He-Man game, and that looked pretty awesome.
1679258	1680800	Reminded me a lot of, like, Golden Axe.
1680900	1686287	But seriously, go pre-order, or not pre-order, go wishlist Densha Attack.
1687168	1688250	It's great.
1688270	1690273	I posted the trailer in Discord.
1690473	1691955	It's so good.
1692340	1708324	well the other thing about that He-Man game that kind of caught my eye is that He-Man has never really had a good video game I'm sorry like and like quick name a He-Man video game there haven't there's been don't think there has been no there's no there has there's been like seven of them one was on the Game Boy Advance Bobby
1708304	1710367	brought up a Commodore 64 one.
1710427	1712450	Well, there were like three of them on the Commodore 64.
1712871	1716756	There was a text adventure game, I believe, at one point.
1716977	1721583	And the reality is, and I'm sure somebody in chat is going to say, you're wrong, and that's fine.
1722104	1726971	None of them were particularly memorable, or we wouldn't be sitting here going, wow,
1726951	1731420	A He-Man side-scroller, like, Ninja Turtles fighting game-looking thing?
1731741	1733324	I can't believe nobody did this before.
1733424	1737573	Like, we wouldn't be saying that if we had, you know, other He-Man games that were extremely memorable.
1737593	1739056	So, I'm excited for that.
1739076	1744707	Now we need to take all these properties that are cool, like, you know, the Power Rangers, Ninja Turtles, He-Man...
1744687	1746169	Smash them all together.
1746189	1747151	Let's smash them all together.
1747391	1753460	All those games have had all those franchises have had relatively successful games recently.
1753480	1760470	So it's like 80s, 80s, 90s, you know, Saturday mornings, Saturday morning Smackdown.
1760950	1761231	Easy.
1761311	1762072	Yeah.
1762252	1762973	Yeah.
1762993	1763434	Oh, yeah.
1764015	1765837	I'm sure a lot of people would play the hell out of that game.
1766178	1766899	Get some G.I.
1766939	1767860	Joe in there.
1767960	1773428	You know, we'll throw in She-Ra, you know, like all sorts of and screech from Saved by the Bell just because.
1773408	1773708	No.
1773728	1773968	No.
1774769	1775730	Oh yeah, that guy.
1775830	1776411	Oh yeah, that's right.
1776431	1777471	That guy kind of turned out.
1777532	1778332	Canceled.
1778352	1781675	That guy kind of turned out a little crazy McGee, didn't he?
1781975	1783056	Fine, then how about Slater?
1783096	1783697	How about Slater?
1783777	1784958	Slater from Saved by the Bell.
1785578	1786880	No, because he's also bad.
1786900	1787160	Is he?
1787920	1788481	What did he do?
1788501	1788981	What about Urkel?
1789762	1791343	Urkel wasn't Saturday morning, was he?
1792685	1796047	Eh, he's TGIF or like Tuesday or something.
1796068	1797208	Oh no, Urkel had a cartoon.
1798530	1798830	Didn't he?
1798850	1799130	That's right.
1799410	1800071	Urkel had a cartoon.
1800371	1802453	Does that mean then that we have to have Ed Grimley?
1803530	1829065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1829045	1845855	so then you'd have to whatever well if we're doing that then we might as well open it up to like 80s Nickelodeon and be like you know what we're gonna have like the unicorn from Eureka's Castle's gonna be here the fucking puppet from uh Pinwheel or no today's David the security guard from today's special uh
1845835	1863000	Barf Barf from uh you can't do that on television I'm Rob I'm so happy you brought up today's special because I fucking loved that show I who didn't that show is if you're if you're up you have to be a very specific age range like you had to have little brothers who were super into it
1862980	1864382	Hell yeah, I get Cherry.
1864683	1865344	Cherry in there.
1865504	1866605	Yeah, from Pee Wee's Playhouse.
1867206	1867567	See?
1868048	1868388	Everything.
1868669	1869470	All of the stuff.
1869490	1870832	The Super Smash Bros.
1870872	1876260	contender is sitting right in front of your fucking noses, and you license holders can't get your shit together.
1876520	1882269	You could all be sitting on mountains of cash if you would just license your 40-year-old properties.
1883751	1885133	It's basically Mugen at that point.
1885875	1888198	Well, and you know, though... Mugen's not real.
1888218	1888819	They all have...
1890520	1894126	They all have to do the other Saturday Morning Classic.
1894686	1902478	Every whatever of this has to end in a Soul Train line.
1902498	1903260	Like during the credits.
1903280	1903860	That's the credits.
1905042	1905603	I love it.
1906444	1910090	Because that was the other Saturday thing was watching Soul Train.
1911652	1913355	Yes, I watched Soul Train.
1913521	1941199	Martello4 in chat says fucking Rob bringing back Eureka's Castle memory unlocked oh you want let's go to the deep let's go to the deep cuts y'all want turkey television come on let's let's bring that on there too uh oh oh Deft Deft just won the chat for tonight Sabato Higante I never heard of that until just now oh my god Sabato Higante was like
1941297	1943921	I mean, it was on... Yeah, I grew up in Alabama.
1944221	1948548	I know, you didn't... Did they not get the Spanish channel in Alabama?
1948708	1954437	Oh, I guess... Well, if they did, no one in my family ever watched it because I come from a bunch of redneck assholes.
1956760	1960466	Well, I mean, it's just, we... You just needed bigger rabbit ears on your TV.
1960506	1961568	It just wasn't as big of a thing.
1961748	1963351	It wasn't as big of a thing.
1963591	1964352	I mean, we...
1966036	1968720	It's just the South.
1968740	1969461	There's a lot of stuff.
1969481	1972786	I never even knew what a quinceañera was until I moved out here.
1972806	1976692	Martello4 in chat says, anything before Hey Dude is purely historical for me.
1976752	1980578	See, that's kind of that early 90s Nickelodeon is kind of where I draw the line.
1980618	1983622	But I would accept the characters from Hey Dude.
1983642	1986407	I would accept Marsha Brady when she was on Hey Dude.
1986467	1988470	I would accept her as a playable character.
1988490	1993738	I would accept the little redhead punk guy from Salute Your Shorts could be a character.
1994218	1994659	I would accept
1994639	2013306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2013893	2014594	Oh, Moe!
2014614	2015095	It's Moe!
2015556	2015816	Moe!
2016096	2016637	I want Moe!
2017258	2018440	I'm playing the aggro Craig.
2018660	2020303	I get to be the aggro Craig, okay?
2020583	2022506	Oh my god, why isn't this a thing?
2022927	2027293	Like, you guys are just going off and now Fifth Dream is bringing Vicky the Robot into this.
2027734	2028154	Y'all.
2028655	2033843	Oh, you went on a rabbit hole reading about behind-the-scenes stuff for Small Wonder, okay?
2036135	2063070	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2063050	2085109	and so this was a big what they call an anomaly event where the two teams because this is a Ingers is very player versus player that's the other thing that some people like about it some people don't like about it but I've always enjoyed it it gets it motivates me to go to places even within my own town that I wouldn't usually go to so and Rin Mari in chat says ENL gang rise up we
2085089	2097462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2097897	2126115	were like honestly I wasn't doing much because there wasn't much to do but I really felt like this time like there was you know a lot of activity going on uh me and one of my best friends who plays the game Johnny we were running from portal to portal to to try to do a link to what's called like a shard we were doing all this stuff um so yeah we were having a lot of fun yeah it was nerdy it was nerdy but it was I got like 20,000 steps that Saturday so but
2126686	2129149	It was a lot like we drove up there.
2129169	2134916	So me and two of my buddies that I know from the game, we drove up on Friday and drove back on Sunday.
2135317	2137179	And that is about a 10 hour drive.
2137239	2139222	It's maybe eight and a half actually on the highway.
2139282	2141524	But, you know, factoring gas, coffee.
2141805	2142846	I know it's a long day.
2142906	2146010	Thank God my friends went because that would have been a really long drive by myself.
2146891	2150075	So I probably would have flown if I was by myself, to be honest.
2150095	2152098	So it was it was a good time.
2152338	2154060	I had a lot of fun.
2154040	2157408	Next weekend, however, is Labor Day weekend.
2157428	2161919	And as I've been doing for the last decade, I'm going to DragonCon.
2162300	2167553	So I will be at DragonCon and I am really, really excited about the show this year.
2168215	2171543	And I can finally tell you because the app was released while we were out.
2171523	2175366	I can tell you some of these pretty cool panels I'm going to be a part of.
2175386	2179490	So I just want to quickly run down my schedule for those that may be going to DragonCon.
2179590	2188759	And you can see a picture version of this over on my BlueSky, which is robroberts.bsky.social, or my Instagram, which is MrMRRobRoberts.
2189199	2190480	You can see them, MrRobRoberts.
2191841	2201530	I would say if you want to meet and say hello, the best time to say hello to myself and Bobby Blackwolf, who's also going from the Voice Geeks Network, because this is his backyard, but it's still like a vacation for him.
2201510	2225087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2225067	2241186	HiltonGallerySX
2241166	2249938	This is for people to meet each other and mingle and just get to know each other from the digital media track because there's a lot of people that talk on the Discord.
2249958	2251740	And it's always like, when are we meeting up at con?
2251760	2252641	When are we meeting up in con?
2252942	2257628	So last year, Bobby and I were like, we should have a meetup at con that's like official.
2257648	2260292	So we did a thing, but not a lot of people showed up.
2260312	2266380	And I honestly, in retrospection, think it should not have been called the VOG Network Presents meeting.
2266360	2268943	Mixer, or whatever we called it last year.
2268963	2270565	This year, we kept our name out of it.
2270645	2271766	I think it's in the description.
2271786	2277032	Yeah, it says Voice Geeks Network in the description, but this is simply called Content Creator Networking and Mixer.
2277052	2290107	So if you want to know where do I meet other people that do other... For me, the most interesting thing about it is I meet people that main YouTube or TikTok, which are venues I'm less familiar with than Twitch or podcasting.
2290187	2292530	So anyway, that'll be for about an hour.
2292870	2294933	Come by and say hello to myself and Bobby.
2295233	2296114	That is really...
2296094	2320870	and DarkSakura.com.
2320850	2323172	On Friday, I will plug this.
2323192	2329898	This is one of Bobby's events, but I'm going to really try to go too because I actually don't have any digital media panels except for the one on Thursday.
2330198	2337165	But Bobby's going to be doing one at 2.30 called the Podcast Track 20th Anniversary Panel because digital media started as the podcast tracks.
2337225	2339066	It's the digital media podcast track.
2339347	2341909	And this track has meant a lot to me over the years too.
2341929	2343410	So I just want to go and make a cameo.
2343470	2345252	Even though Bobby's on the panel, I'm not.
2345592	2346833	I just want to be in the room and heckle.
2347354	2348054	So that's my plan.
2348075	2350857	That's Friday at 2.30 also in Galleria 6.
2350837	2361097	Now the first big panel, I'm fortunate that as of last year I'm working with the main programming track at DragonCon and I feel myself, I consider myself very lucky and fortunate to be there.
2361197	2371177	I'm so happy that they will have me because now I get to do some big panels such as this one that's going to be Friday at 4pm in the Atrium.
2371638	2372760	That is...
2372740	2393938	Once Upon a Time Once Upon a Time
2393918	2394759	Yeah, it was called Once.
2395840	2401705	I think it was Once, dot, dot, dot, and sometimes you would see it stylized upon a time, but Once was the name.
2403246	2407710	So we have six people that were on that show, including Regina.
2407730	2408391	I'm really excited about that.
2408851	2410173	And Hook.
2410533	2411354	Hook is on the panel.
2413075	2413456	Right?
2413796	2414156	Right?
2414316	2414857	Right.
2414877	2416138	So we got a lot of really cool people.
2416158	2417579	I'm very excited about that.
2418080	2420522	So that's on Friday at 4 o'clock.
2421363	2423925	Saturday is a pretty big day for me.
2423905	2425507	This is wild.
2425547	2426469	I can't believe this is happening.
2426509	2432558	So Saturday, and Ranma, yes, I am cosplaying, and I'll come back to that question in a minute.
2433719	2438567	And this is all because of my friend Victoria, Arya Snark, who is going to her first DragonCon.
2438587	2443894	We are doing a couples cosplay on Saturday night, and I'll explain that in a minute.
2443914	2452427	So Saturday at 11.30 a.m., I am doing a panel also in the atrium with the cast from the Fox television show Bones.
2452407	2452607	No!
2452728	2453188	Yeah.
2453328	2476626	Yeah.
2476606	2494716	Thank you for watching!
2494915	2500932	In the West and Peachtree, Saturday at 2.30, Baldur's Gate 3.
2501253	2505164	Once again, we have the other half of the cast of Baldur's Gate 3.
2505585	2509937	So sadly, nobody last year is coming back.
2509917	2526475	Carameldansen
2526455	2529580	Tim Downey, who played Gale, will be there.
2529720	2532023	Emma Gregory, who played Minthara, will be on that panel.
2532504	2536470	Sissy Jones, the Absolute, will be on that panel as well.
2536490	2539835	Dave Jones, who played Halson, will be there as well.
2539855	2545343	And they just announced, it was only going to be those five, and this is how things change.
2545583	2551011	They were able to secure last week, Amelia Tyler, the narrator, is going to be there as well.
2550991	2551392	Nice.
2551532	2552715	I love her.
2552735	2553897	She is a treasure.
2553917	2555580	I mean, they all are great.
2555721	2559509	Every fucking person in that game gives an award-winning performance.
2559529	2563136	That's why we are still talking about this game this far after the launch.
2564098	2571132	But yes, obviously, Amelia in her role frames the whole stinking thing and is your biggest introduction to that.
2571153	2572375	I love her outtakes, too.
2572355	2575082	Oh man, I'm just like, I'm hyped for that panel.
2575363	2576526	That is a Q&A panel.
2577368	2578852	So, you know, please come ask questions.
2579033	2579614	You'll have a good time.
2581098	2581820	Let's see.
2581840	2586111	We also have... Ask her if she'll narrate my life.
2586715	2587776	Very excited about this.
2587796	2588898	This is gaming related.
2588918	2590079	I have gaming related stuff too.
2590099	2591501	This is super gaming related.
2591521	2598550	In the Westin and the Augusta E-H rooms on Saturday at 4 o'clock, I'll be doing a panel called The Way of the Loremaster.
2598651	2602275	So this is just myself and Sean Copeland, who is with Blizzard.
2602576	2603958	He is the Blizzard Loremaster.
2603978	2605439	He is the keeper of the lore at Blizzard.
2606461	2609685	It's funny because I attended this panel as a fan.
2609665	2617376	I went just because that was the year Diablo 4 launched, and I just wanted to hear all about the Diablo lore and what went into it.
2617456	2628633	So I've been on this panel on the other side in the audience, and so I'm very honored to be sitting and being the one to moderate the questions for Sean about the Blizzard lore.
2628713	2632038	So I'm very excited about that panel and that opportunity.
2632078	2634441	So that is Saturday at 4 o'clock.
2634421	2641655	I'm going to plug a panel that's not mine, but I really want to try to drive attendance because this is also a gaming-related panel.
2642035	2653898	So also on Saturday at 7 o'clock at night in the Westin E3H room, Bobby is going to be hosting the first-ever Speedrun Showcase at...
2654013	2655736	DragonCon.
2655756	2658501	They're going to be speedrunning with... Actually, Bobby's not speedrunning.
2658561	2660204	A very popular Twitch name.
2660765	2662307	And this guy's great.
2662367	2662808	I love him.
2662948	2666054	He gives off game show host energy, which I love.
2666374	2672224	An Eternal Enigma is going to be the one that's actually speedrunning Silent Hill 4 The Room.
2672505	2679717	And the reason why I shout that out is that I want butts in the seats at this because this is...
2679697	2700068	Thank you for watching!
2700622	2723727	DJ Ranma S
2723707	2752178	which she has a from the stage version of Wicked she has an amazing Elphaba outfit that she's wearing I think Sunday but Saturday she's put together an all new costume and she is going to be dressed as Fiona from the 1999 2000 that era classic Josie and the Pussycats that was the character Parker Posey played so she said Rob it would be very easy for you to dress as Wyatt and I said Alan Cumming
2752158	2753100	I'm in.
2753120	2754843	So I'm going to dress as Wyatt.
2755024	2764523	But her outfit, like she literally, so it's from the end of the movie where she's in that dress and it has 400 like vinyl mega records, decals on it.
2764764	2765726	She made that fucking dress.
2765806	2766407	It's incredible.
2766687	2768571	She's been detailing it on her Instagram.
2768591	2768952	I'm not surprised.
2768932	2777856	Yeah, so I'm going to go as Wyatt to compliment her Fiona, but that is going to be Saturday night.
2778137	2782429	I'm not going to wear that during my panels because that would be a little weird.
2782449	2783953	And I don't want
2783933	2790067	I'm gonna say it's unprofessional because I know other moderators do cosplay, but I just feel like it takes it out of the zone a little bit for me.
2790508	2793955	For me, in my right headspace, so I'm gonna do that at night.
2793975	2800510	So you might catch me at that speedrun showcase for a little bit dressed as that, but that's, yeah, that's the cosplay I am bringing.
2802053	2802274	Okay.
2802855	2802955	Okay.
2803137	2806320	I'm almost done, sorry, but I have two other panels to talk about.
2806380	2808482	That is Sunday.
2808783	2812507	I am going to be, and I just clicked off of it on the app.
2812527	2812787	Oops.
2813147	2816331	But you can find me in the app under speakers, Rob Roberts.
2817111	2822056	I know nobody is going to the con just to see me, but if you're curious where I'm at, that's a good way to figure it out.
2822076	2823138	Okay.
2823358	2828503	Sunday at 10 a.m.,
2829226	2834231	And that is over in the Hilton Grand West.
2834251	2836653	I think this is where I did a Lower Decks panel last year.
2836673	2843460	So in the Hilton Grand West, we have the Shaolin Brotherhood, The Journey of Liu Kang and Kung Lao.
2843880	2846182	So that is a Mortal Kombat movie panel.
2846243	2848725	So it's the recent reboot from 2020.
2849386	2854270	And the sequel, what they can say about it, I'm sure will come up.
2854290	2857073	But we have Ludi Lin who played...
2857053	2878027	Luke Kang, and Max Wang who played Kung Lao so very excited about that they will be on that panel with me talking about the Mortal Kombat films and we will do Q&A at that one and then again another pinch me moment I can't believe I'm being asked to do this but once again in the atrium on Sunday at 1130 a.m.
2878608	2884377	Star Wars panel I've been asked back to do the Star Wars hodgepodge panel and
2884660	2885281	Get this.
2886562	2889947	This is quite the hodgepodge of celebrities from the Star Wars universe.
2889967	2897636	I am so honored that I will get to sit down with John Boyega, who plays Finn, of course, the Stormtrooper in the movie trilogy.
2898457	2904144	Also on that panel, Diana Lee Inosanto, who plays Morgan Elsbeth in The Mandalorian.
2905806	2905906	Cool.
2905926	2907208	Simon...
2907188	2912139	Cassian Etis, who plays Axe Woves, I think in like four episodes of The Mandalorian.
2912179	2916288	So a little bit more of a minor part, but had an important arc in The Mandalorian.
2916809	2920256	Emily Swallow, who also was in The Mandalorian as the Armorer.
2921138	2923944	She is amazing for the record.
2923984	2925788	She was also in Supernatural.
2925768	2944553	as Lilith.
2944533	2949599	but he is a prolific voice actor and it's gaming related.
2949619	2955807	He played Starkiller in Star Wars The Force Unleashed and Force Unleashed 2 and the Soul Calibur cameo for Starkiller.
2956168	2956989	That's Sam Witwer.
2957609	2962476	He also played Darth Maul in a lot of the animated projects and Emperor Palpatine in a few of them as well.
2962536	2969004	So he's a very prolific Star Wars type of person in a lot of that.
2969024	2970726	So it's...
2970706	2977757	It is a very... This is that kind of infamous DragonCon hodgepodge of people that are related to the same thing.
2978378	2992461	So I'm very curious to hear how the Q&A is going to go at that panel when you've got John Boyega, you've got some very talented folks that were on The Mandalorian, and you have animated and video game universe kind of people all
2992441	2994524	All on the same panel.
2994925	2996668	I'm really excited to see how that goes.
2996708	2997169	But you know what?
2997289	2999933	Last year's Star Wars panel was a very similar sort of thing.
2999953	3002137	They were all on different shows.
3002457	3003619	And I had a blast.
3003679	3005462	And I like to think the audience did too.
3005562	3006885	So I think we'll have a blast again this year.
3006965	3008026	So yeah.
3008948	3009589	Very busy.
3009609	3011432	Very excited for this year's DragonCon.
3011632	3013495	I kind of can't believe it's Wednesday.
3015398	3015599	Yeah.
3015899	3017622	So...
3017602	3019866	Yeah, I'm leaving on Wednesday, so I have to pinch myself.
3019946	3022149	But I bought some last-minute outfits.
3022229	3022850	I'm very excited.
3022891	3026476	I have some new loud-ass shirts and loud pants to wear on some of these panels.
3026496	3028239	So I'm very, very looking forward.
3028259	3029241	I'm going to rock the bald.
3029802	3031224	I'm ditching the hats this year.
3031364	3037494	I may take one or two cabi hats, but overall, I'm going to rock the bald this year, which is new for me, too, on television.
3037514	3040118	So I'm very excited for all of that.
3040138	3040639	So...
3042205	3047510	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
3047530	3048611	So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
3048631	3049292	How was your gaming week?
3050553	3050993	It was alright.
3052535	3054597	I played Dead by Daylight, of course.
3056118	3061944	I've played Palia, I've played Mass Effect, and then whatever I'm playing on my phone.
3061964	3062624	That's about it.
3063045	3064566	Nothing big, just my usuals.
3066989	3068550	Alright, then we'll go over to Loki.
3069762	3076026	Well, I've been fighting PC stuff this week, but mostly I've been...
3076225	3083475	finishing up the Slumber Dome, which was my massive project that I was working on on our Channel 64 SMP.
3083935	3089202	So it's a massive battle arena with a custom data pack that I coded.
3089222	3099356	So it's basically a PvE arena with 20 different randomized waves of mobs you get to fight, and I mean, it goes on forever.
3099376	3103461	You get gear, you get power-ups, items, all sorts of stuff.
3103661	3104983	So it's like a full...
3104963	3111952	Fledged game with custom music, audio, visuals, all the flair.
3112392	3113994	Fireworks, there's fireworks in there.
3115696	3120482	Should have my new episode out about it tonight, hopefully.
3120943	3130354	Like I said, I've been fighting, like, there were some weird random crash issues I had with my PC that I think I've sorted out, but I'm not really sure.
3130374	3133418	And it caused a lot of weird stuff to happen, like
3133972	3138277	Streamlabs OBS, which I've been trying to get away from for a while now.
3139298	3141580	It basically wiped all the settings in it.
3141741	3142942	Or no, it didn't wipe all the settings.
3143102	3149810	It got to a point where it was incredibly choppy in Streamlabs OBS.
3149870	3152052	Like I was recording playback.
3152453	3157258	My view is like 100% fine, 120 FPS or whatever.
3158059	3160782	In the capture, it's like 2 FPS.
3160862	3163725	I'm like, okay, that's not right.
3163705	3171786	So, I dumped that finally, which I should have done a while ago, but I'm now in vanilla OBS, and everything's working fine.
3172628	3180769	After I got past some learning curve stuff with the extra inputs and stuff that it has in there, it has like a default, like...
3180749	3206082	Game Audio and a default mic capture in there that's always set and so I had to like figure out that that was in there and take it out so that I have better control because I don't like to record my mic audio in OBS when I record I record separate so in case if I flub something or I want to rearrange where my audio is plus I'm able to put more filters on top of it that kind of
3206062	3234263	And then Bellatro, I was playing a little bit of Bellatro
3235593	3236755	Yeah, I played a little of that too.
3237376	3237896	Nice.
3237916	3240180	That's about it, I think.
3240681	3240881	Cool.
3241842	3242824	Let's see my gaming week.
3242904	3245969	So obviously there was the Ingress stuff going on, so that counts.
3246489	3250515	But also, you know I'm still playing Final Fantasy XI on the Horizon server.
3250596	3255022	I even did a stream and had some people that are also playing on Horizon dip in, and that was really cool.
3255102	3256484	Very supportive community.
3256504	3260250	I was kind of talking about this where I was like, I think a good chunk of the people that are playing Horizon...
3260230	3263715	are people that were playing Final Fantasy XI in their teens and 20s.
3264056	3266379	And so now it's like a late 30s and 40s crowd.
3266439	3268302	And so there's just... I'm just going to keep it real.
3268322	3273650	There's a certain level of maturity that comes with that, I think, that you don't have as many edgelords as maybe play other MMOs.
3273770	3275393	Not to say those don't exist.
3275453	3277075	I've seen a couple questionable...
3277055	3278036	type of people.
3278056	3283724	But for the most part, I've really enjoyed the community with Horizon and dipping back into Final Fantasy XI.
3284144	3288209	I got my Red Mage to level 30, which means I get to unlock the advanced jobs next.
3288249	3289671	That'll be my next big thing.
3289691	3296960	And the wild thing is, so like Loki, you remember the Final Fantasy XI days, and DarkSakura, you too, to an extent.
3297341	3302067	I did a couple of Dunes parties, but otherwise, these parties have been in places like
3302047	3309836	Sarah Magoo, Champagne, Palboro, or excuse me, Rollenberry Fields was one of them, Maze of Chakrami.
3310657	3322191	There's zones that you don't usually go to, but the way Horizon sort of, I think they rebalanced some of the monster distribution and made some other XP camps so everybody wasn't always in the same fucking place.
3322211	3329099	So I never did an XP party in Quiffham Island, which in the old vanilla days was like your level 20 to 30 zone.
3329119	3331682	I never did a party there, and I'm level 30, which is wild.
3331662	3333284	So, um, it's kind of neat.
3333324	3335847	Like I, I'm, I'm, again, I'm just loving the experience there.
3335867	3341134	So I was been sinking a lot of hours than I care to admit on 11, but it's a lot of core memories unlocked for me.
3341154	3343357	And just, I've been relatively enjoying the experience.
3343818	3344479	I did promise.
3344519	3346041	I'm getting stuck on Quiff of Mailand.
3346261	3348364	Like you get stuck back in the jungle there.
3348384	3350987	And it was just like, you're thinking of Kazam.
3351389	3354797	Oh, you're right, you're right.
3354877	3363477	I'm still collecting my Kazam keys, which now I can solo because there's less pressure to go there until you're more in your 30s and 40s.
3365502	3366083	Was it Juno?
3366203	3367727	Yeah, that's right, that's right.
3367707	3371053	So it's with the giant green ogre things are out there.
3371073	3372535	Yeah, it's that it looks very dark.
3372656	3373818	That's Quiff of Myland.
3373838	3376683	I just remember the leeches and the worms, I think.
3377124	3378005	So that's the thing.
3378025	3380850	Like playing this has been a lot of like, oh, core memory unlocked.
3380910	3385058	Oh, and now I've been learning thanks to watching some other streamers and looking at some YouTubes.
3385378	3391048	I learned how to unlock the frames per second so that you can play the game or I should say cap it at 60 frames.
3391028	3396703	which is very smooth and looks great and some of the other graphical upgrades which is awesome.
3396944	3400172	Okay, I did say I would play other games as well too and I did.
3400272	3406168	I checked out a free game that was on Epic Game Store which was called Hidden Folks and
3406148	3426520	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3426500	3431891	So I like it as a chill type of game and as a very sort of like pick up, easy play.
3432192	3436921	You can save your spot, come back to it later, almost like a crossword puzzle or something.
3436941	3443975	The one questionable choice in this game is that all of the sound effects is like somebody beatboxing.
3443995	3446280	Like somebody did a bloop, bloop, beep.
3447037	3450000	Every time you click something, it makes some funky noise.
3451362	3452723	Not a big fan of that.
3452743	3456867	So I actually try to disable sounds when I play the game.
3456987	3458829	But the game itself, I am enjoying.
3458930	3460771	I understand the stylistic choice to do it.
3461072	3461873	I just don't like it.
3461893	3464115	So that's my one feedback on that game.
3464135	3468339	But otherwise, especially knowing that it is a freebie, or at least I think was last week.
3468359	3469120	I don't think it is anymore.
3469861	3471863	It was definitely worth checking out.
3471923	3474546	And I know they get paid by Epic, so that's great.
3474526	3504043	so I checked out that game and then I've been playing some retro games too just going through some NES classics but something's fucky with my NES emulator right now because I'll play the game for five minutes and it'll be great and then all of a sudden five minutes in I'll start getting frame skip like bad like on a game like fucking Donkey Kong that should not be getting the bad like lag and stuff and slow down and it's not like NES you know hardware slow down or anything like that it's something to do with the emulator and retro arc I gotta figure out what the fuck's going on
3504023	3506446	Somebody, I've been trying to, you know, sleuth online.
3506847	3511534	It sounds like it could be something like the games recording element or something could be screwed it up.
3511554	3519365	So I got to go in and see if I can disable that because that would make a lot of sense as to it's fine for five minutes and then suddenly starts acting fucky would make sense.
3519385	3521448	It's something like some sort of buffer in there.
3521528	3524392	So I'm going to look into that and try to fix it.
3524432	3528017	Somebody had said, just delete your configuration file and let RetroArch make a new one.
3528077	3528758	I might just do that.
3529119	3529900	See if that fixes it.
3530380	3531542	We'll see.
3531562	3531762	All right.
3531782	3532984	But that was my gaming week.
3533538	3537149	We do have some more news to get into, so I'm going to go over to Loki.
3537209	3537895	Start us off.
3538870	3543936	Alright, well, let's talk a little bit about Black Ops 7, my favorite game!
3545078	3561198	So one of the things that was definitely noticeable in Black Ops 6 last year was some of the questionable choices that seem to be coming from AI generative art use in the game.
3561758	3565763	I think the most notable example of that would have been the six-figured zombie.
3566764	3568827	Now, to be fair,
3569583	3582529	Call of Duty does do some silly stuff with the zombies where the number of fingers is the version of the game so it could technically be that but
3583505	3602172	Thanks for watching!
3602371	3605639	We live in a world now where there's AI tools.
3605699	3614018	I think our official statement is, we said last year around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team 100%.
3614403	3619511	We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes into the game.
3620252	3628324	Of course, there are some things that look like they've gone straight into the game and it looks like no one's touched it.
3628525	3631730	And he said, well, it was probably by accident.
3631750	3635355	And it was never the intention for it to be just dumped in the game like that.
3635816	3641845	We've come out and been very clear that we use these tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members.
3641825	3644630	that we have and what they're doing with the final touches and building the game.
3645010	3653985	But I have to wonder though, like, you know, when you're crunching your team like this that cut, you know, corners will be cut and that they might do that.
3654566	3658753	But yeah, and then of course, you know, they asked him straight up, hey, what about Santa Claus with six fingers there?
3659254	3666686	And he's like, well, not my department, but I know the team that's actually looking at stuff and making sure that's not shipped.
3666706	3668068	That's how we fix it.
3668605	3668946	Cool.
3669207	3672075	You take no responsibility for the stuff that's out there.
3672577	3676509	When you're like, oh, no, we touch everything and then you show them, well, no, actually you don't.
3676569	3679678	And he's like, not my problem.
3681008	3683011	So I don't know.
3683071	3684452	That doesn't fill me with confidence.
3684553	3687717	But yeah, expect more AI slop in the near future.
3688197	3689960	I guarantee that.
3689980	3690721	It's interesting.
3690741	3696007	And you all know I'm not a fan of the generative AI, especially as replacement art.
3696027	3701194	And I think we've seen a lot of companies that have used it for placeholder projects.
3701174	3728818	Yeah, everything is...
3728798	3750199	about Magic the Gathering was recently put to the fire a little bit because they had sort of been caught using some AI and their response was to sort of deflect and blame Adobe's generative fill because what they were doing, I guess they were taking the 2D card, which obviously Magic has some stellar human art behind it, but it sounded like they were-
3750179	3751901	Boris Vallejo for a while.
3752341	3753102	Julie Bell.
3753222	3759588	They were taking the 2D card art and they had to, for certain things, expand it into 3D box space.
3760048	3763872	They were using Adobe Generative Fill to do it and they got caught doing it.
3764032	3766154	What do you think generative in that means?
3766314	3772039	It's not generated out of space by magic artists that live in the cosmos.
3772060	3775663	It's AI that's doing it.
3775983	3777925	I feel like
3779137	3782803	You're going to see more of these places where the tools are sort of unavoidable.
3782823	3786388	And Bobby brings up a great point in this too in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
3786408	3793419	Bobby Blackwolf says all of these companies are forcing AI into all their products because nobody was using it when it was extra.
3793780	3797145	So they're just bundling it in and raising the base price.
3797125	3799570	That is, yeah, that's a huge thing that's happened.
3799590	3802776	Microsoft obviously did that pretty recently with Office.
3803217	3808287	And yeah, now you have fucking Copilot in Notepad, which nobody asked for, right?
3808387	3815742	And it's just, I definitely think, and while you can turn that off in Notepad, and I did, it's wild to me.
3815722	3843670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3843650	3850339	I understand a lot of people are gonna combat that with the computing power it uses and all of this stuff.
3850399	3854064	And I would say that train has already left the station.
3854725	3859631	These companies are already incorporating AI into all of these different ways.
3859651	3864578	So I think we are left with where do we as consumers
3864558	3871490	Draw those lines of what are we willing to pay for that comes out of AI and what are we going to reject?
3871510	3881026	And I think you've already seen that in the gaming space that when generative AI is used to basically do the art assets in a game, people are not fucking interested in that.
3881046	3885233	They're about as interested in that as they were the NFT type of thing.
3885213	3901108	I actually read an article in Forbes not long ago that was talking about how it's only 5% of company AI initiatives actually show any success, that the majority of them are failing and losing money for companies.
3902650	3910217	I think especially where people are thinking AI is going to replace people, I think a lot of companies are going to get what they pay for in that regard.
3910237	3911338	And
3912314	3913476	Maybe that needs to happen.
3913496	3913836	I don't know.
3916200	3917101	Some other comments in chat.
3917121	3923111	Martello4 says, AI should be regulated heavily and they know it because of the reasons they are going to and are using it.
3924292	3930021	Yes, and actually I think there's a pretty big lawsuit against MidJourney?
3930422	3931003	One of those AI?
3931504	3937613	And it's coming from Hollywood because they basically went to MidJourney and said, paint me a picture of Shrek.
3937593	3940216	and it made the copyright and trademark character Shrek.
3940677	3944942	Paint me a picture of Jasmine from Aladdin and it spat out.
3945282	3952150	So it's spitting out copyright and trademark things so Hollywood is bringing down its iron fist and all of its lawyers on AI.
3952170	3960580	And I think that is the battle that needs to be fought and needs to be fought quickly because they are raising some good points.
3960560	3964084	in that particular circumstance with all the generative stuff.
3964104	3966127	So it'd be interesting to see what comes of that.
3966147	3968210	And I agree, AI needs to be regulated.
3968230	3980425	But when we can't fucking get trademark and patent and all this other law updated, I could go on a whole other tangent about what the drag performer Lexi Love is going through right now.
3980405	3996878	and DarkSakura.com.
3996858	4002566	because she's sending cease and desist things to the venue when nobody gives a fuck who this other person is.
4002586	4015384	They're a no-name performer in Hollywood that is using this to profit off of what a trans woman has done on television and the past she's drawn for herself.
4015404	4017688	It's really sick, to be quite honest.
4017708	4023296	And that's the type of thing where it's like, trademark law is really fucked right now that she has the ability to do that.
4023616	4026460	She, being the adult performer, has the ability to do that.
4026440	4027622	Right now.
4027642	4035653	And I hope the drag performer takes her ass to court because the trademark had lapsed and gets that fucking thing yanked away from her.
4036033	4046868	And I bet it reminds me a lot of how the, and then sues her ass for getting all those things canceled, reminds me of when somebody tried to, was it trademark or patent?
4046888	4048971	I think it was patent podcasting.
4048951	4058792	and DarkSakura.
4060358	4062421	I think that'll happen in that scenario.
4062441	4074140	So anyway, I know we're getting a long way from AI, but my point being is that when we can't regulate these other laws that were written decades ago, the technology is moving faster than the laws.
4074160	4079869	And the problem is all the lawmakers are consumed with dumb fucking shit right now.
4080676	4094972	Well, and even that there are people today using outdated laws to make other legislation, even to push more governmental control that needs to happen.
4095473	4095934	Yeah.
4097062	4098404	Wait, what?
4098644	4117230	Well, that's fine.
4117210	4118231	Hold on.
4118451	4119032	I am not done.
4119492	4126420	What it regulates the companies to store because the companies basically have to store your proof of identification that you're an adult.
4126440	4128482	And Blue Sky is like, we're not taking part in that.
4128502	4131165	We're not going to store that type of sensitive information on our end.
4131605	4135649	And it's because of that they're saying, we're just going to pull Blue Sky from Mississippi.
4135669	4136831	We don't have the resources to enforce that.
4136851	4137551	Well, then good for them.
4137952	4138152	Yeah.
4138693	4143538	And if the people care enough about it, they'll do something.
4143558	4143758	Yeah.
4145898	4149483	Anyway, yeah, and as Stuart Hunter-Matt says, too many stupid wars on a lot of fronts.
4149603	4152247	And now it's this whole, you know, bullshit over gerrymandering.
4152267	4153028	And they're trying to distract us.
4153048	4156593	They're all trying to distract us from the important things going on.
4157474	4175179	We could pass a constitutional amendment, and I bet most people, most rational people, when not sitting next to a television, most rational people would agree with all 50 states ought to have independent districting commissions that draw the maps.
4175159	4177963	All 50 states ought to have that.
4177983	4180186	And that could be a thing that they could put in the Constitution.
4180626	4184752	And then it would end all of this other garbage, no matter what side of the fence you're on.
4185113	4192082	If you're Texas, Newsom, no matter where you sit, that could end relatively quickly with a constitutional amendment.
4192102	4193604	They'll never do it.
4193664	4195807	No politician would agree to that.
4195927	4199412	Yeah, everything is too fucking...
4199864	4202247	Black and White now, and two extreme, to one end.
4202547	4204710	There is no more middle ground.
4205011	4205231	None.
4205952	4209256	I have also said on repeat that I think that the U.S.
4209316	4213321	is too big for proper governance.
4214903	4216425	By size and by population.
4219269	4223094	By the way, it's not on our show roll tonight, but the prices of the PlayStation 5 went up.
4223114	4224176	Does anyone want to guess why?
4226378	4227139	Because of a dumpster?
4227159	4227660	Because they're terrific?
4229429	4230453	I think you all know the answer.
4230493	4232662	They're terrific.
4233185	4234008	They're terrific.
4234952	4236418	Just the world we live in, folks.
4238103	4244810	But hey, there are things to bring us joy and merriment in times of strife, and that would be Kirby Air Riders.
4244830	4245511	We love Kirby.
4245531	4246592	Oh, Kirby always makes me happy.
4246652	4247934	Kirby always makes me happy.
4248434	4252659	That's why they're putting Kirby on ketchup bottles now, because Kirby makes people happy.
4252679	4255362	So there's an all-new Kirby game, as you know, that's coming out.
4255422	4256824	It's Kirby Air Riders.
4256844	4263731	And of course, this was the game that was originally on the GameCube, but they are doing an all-new version for the Nintendo Switch 2, and it's coming out November 20th.
4263791	4268076	And there was a whole direct that they did that is showing off the game.
4268056	4269318	I'm excited for it.
4269718	4278349	I do question Nintendo putting out two racing games as flagship titles in the same year and this early on.
4278369	4284717	I'm not sure that's the right strategy, but I also realize they're very different types of racing games.
4285297	4287040	I know y'all are typing right now to correct me.
4287060	4290604	Yes, I realize they are very different experiences at the end of the day, but it's just...
4290584	4292627	Just a little interesting, that's all.
4293988	4296011	But either way, I'll still buy it.
4296071	4296732	I'll still play it.
4296792	4298214	It looks really good.
4298354	4301879	I just recently played the GameCube one for the first time, and I enjoyed myself.
4301899	4303902	So I'll check out the sequel for sure.
4304082	4310170	In the direct, they were spotlighting things such as writing techniques and the different forms and traits of the writing machine.
4310931	4312213	We have the boost charge.
4312233	4317840	So if you hit the B button, your little machine hits the ground, and you can do a boost charge with that for a boost dash.
4317820	4320062	Specials they were doing.
4320422	4323285	The Y button does a unique special move for the character.
4323305	4325687	So now there's more than one button to push, for sure.
4326127	4331692	The Air Riders also unleash strategy into your choice of rider.
4332112	4336316	So every rider in the game has different traits that will impact the machine's performance.
4336336	4339899	Weight, durability, specials, what you do at close range, and all of that.
4339919	4343522	So there's a lot of faces from Kirby.
4343542	4347085	Meta Knight, DDD, Bandana Waddle Dee...
4347368	4349390	Capy, Starman, so on and so on.
4349410	4352714	There's a lot of characters in the Kirby world that are showing up and that'll be a lot of fun.
4353355	4358841	You can also inhale or copy an enemy's abilities because of course it's Kirby.
4358861	4359762	Why wouldn't you be able to do that?
4359782	4360163	Because it's Kirby.
4360183	4360623	That's right.
4361044	4363447	So anyway, the game looks really fun.
4363627	4371156	People will be able to get their hands on over at the other convention happening this weekend in Seattle if for whatever reason you made your choice to go there.
4371316	4376582	I guess if you are a resident of the Pacific Northwest maybe it makes more sense to go to that convention.
4376562	4404628	DarkSakura
4406600	4408003	Let us see.
4408123	4409325	Well, Roblox.
4410527	4419363	How many times have we talked about all the various different user-made games on Roblox that they're making money off of?
4419744	4421487	That are rip-offs of other things.
4421939	4422921	Well, not just that, yeah.
4423683	4438699	But at any rate, Roblox published a post recently where they were talking about some changes, including restricting unrated experiences, which is what they call those games.
4438679	4444407	and to those developers or those who are actively working on them.
4444427	4453098	And it will be rolling out in the coming months with changing things from allowing users 13 or older to access unrated games.
4453138	4459827	This is coming after a series of lawsuits that are claiming Roblox isn't providing a safe environment for underage users.
4460785	4472749	So for any inappropriate behavior, social hangout experiences that show private spaces like bedrooms or bathrooms will be limited to ID verified users at 17 or older.
4474392	4478220	They will restrict these hangout games that take place
4478200	4488091	The previous ones that take place in those sorts of adult-only places are places like bars and clubs, who are at least 17, and have been ID verified.
4488812	4505170	And they will roll out a tool that automatically detects what they're calling violative scenes, or basically anything that goes against the rules, and that if a server hits enough violations, it automatically gets taken down
4505150	4509254	and they have to work with the Roblox team to get it adjusted to get it back online.
4513099	4518545	Yeah, these lawsuits, there's one by Louisiana's Attorney General.
4520787	4522609	There's a number of them.
4524231	4527314	But I'm going to just read what the company's statement is.
4527474	4534482	Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.
4534462	4543447	No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection including efforts to take users to other platforms where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.
4545252	4547458	So they done fucked up and now they're trying to fix it.
4548805	4566240	Internet2CatchAPredator.com
4566929	4595890	Oh yeah, the predators that you're pointing out too.
4595870	4620578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4620845	4622170	But they do let them know.
4622391	4627412	But now he's working with Chris Hansen to make a documentary on the whole thing.
4628388	4635317	Let me ask you this, Loki, because I don't know Roblox that well besides what I see on TikTok and social media and stuff.
4635377	4637520	And it just looks like – I don't know.
4637540	4640564	It looks like this weird shithole of the internet, but I don't know.
4640765	4645611	You've said your kids have played that before and stuff.
4646252	4647814	What's your take on all of this?
4647834	4653742	Is this a big part of the platform based on your experience watching your kids play Roblox?
4653762	4654243	It's like –
4654223	4660157	It's like, I mean, I think with the platform, you can kind of look at it like Steam almost.
4660598	4670983	Or even like just a lot of the other marketplaces where you have some content that's quality, some content that's not great, but it's like, it's still...
4670963	4695469	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4695449	4701736	You know, instead of addressing those things that people have been complaining about saying like, yeah, there's inappropriate stuff on here.
4701877	4706842	They only react to it when there's a big stink made about it.
4706862	4721760	So like, for example, one of the things that Schlepp brought up in his videos were the only time that they would ever take one of these people that have been arrested, you know, off of their platform was when he made a big video about it that got millions of views.
4721740	4727096	And now, this whole reaction to his videos, that's the only reason that they're acting now.
4727116	4728460	And they even keep changing stuff.
4728480	4731268	It's like, well, wait a second, this is adult-only content.
4731409	4735902	Why are you making the age to see it 17?
4736033	4737235	Why is it not 18?
4738196	4739497	Like, that's weird.
4740158	4741140	Like, why are you doing this?
4741220	4752214	Why are you exerting more effort to protect the pedophiles or potential predators on your platform versus addressing the issues that people keep bringing up to you?
4752694	4764910	Also, why do you have a game on your platform or even allow a game on your platform, whether it's marked 17 plus or not, that allows you to just hang out in bathrooms with other people and like chit chat about stuff?
4764890	4765273	Why?
4765595	4766340	Why is that a thing?
4766360	4768615	Just say no, you can't make those types of games.
4769018	4769300	Done.
4770226	4771474	So easy.
4771572	4796854	Curating your platform maybe I don't know if it's you know one of those things where like they can't curate the platform because then they lose their like title 2 protections or something like that you know like YouTube or something like that um I don't know I don't know what the rules are but like as far as it seems like and it seems to be the agreement from a lot of content creators because even a lot of their partner like streamers and content creators have like said buh-bye we're not dealing with you anymore after all this and
4796834	4824546	they're not doing enough and so I think that this reaction that they're taking right now is not enough and they're losing stock value from it and everything interesting thanks for the take on it because Roblox is really like a foreign world to me I think I downloaded the client on Xbox once and maybe I tried to open it and I was like I don't know what the fuck this is it's like downloading Steam as a platform except it's a platform that you can
4824526	4851394	make content in there's some stuff that's like extremely polished there's some stuff that's popular but it's not polished I do see like some of the stuff like the squid game inspired game like somehow some of that stuff worked its way into my TikTok algorithm but it does it always is weird because I feel like it involves screaming kids like it's and I'm always feel a little weird when I see that stuff on TikTok because I'm like this video is profiting off of some kid having a meltdown on Roblox I don't know that I love that
4851374	4854080	It's a weird environment.
4854301	4858370	I haven't seen that stuff in a long time, though.
4858390	4862139	I think finally I skipped enough of them where they stopped showing me Roblox videos.
4863763	4868995	Thankfully, I've not gotten a single Roblox video except for the Dead by Daylight one.
4869177	4871983	I've seen the Dead by Daylight one too, but that was a little more like one.
4872003	4872865	That's actually kind of cool.
4873546	4875430	Yeah, it's weird.
4875530	4882384	It's like watching it would be, to me, it's like watching somebody made a port of Dead by Daylight for the PlayStation 2.
4882945	4884588	The PlayStation 1.
4884628	4887134	It's like watching somebody made a port of that for the PS1.
4887635	4888857	That's, yeah.
4888837	4892462	Anyway, SGO100 Matt in chat says, my nephew who is nine plays a lot.
4892482	4895666	Thankfully, his parents play with him, so they're able to moderate anything bad there.
4895966	4898690	You know, as much as I sit here and I go, I don't get Roblox.
4898750	4899651	I'm an old man.
4900172	4906180	I think to when I was 12 or 13, I was dialing into BBS systems.
4906200	4907942	And let me tell you.
4908412	4933153	there were definitely things happening in those environments that should not have been like like there were definitely adults that were talking to me when I was 13 which nothing nothing ever crossed the line at the time so it's this isn't that kind of story but looking back on it I go that's fucking weird that that happened when I was 13 you know and so it's just interesting yeah
4933488	4938093	Alright, since we were talking about Steam, Loki.
4938113	4939074	Yep.
4939114	4950605	So Steam is overhauling their Steam review system, and so what the main change is going to be on it is that now, when you look at Steam reviews, they're only going to be of your language.
4950805	4959394	And the reason that they're doing that is because some of the things that maybe, like, say a player that speaks English...
4959374	4967605	is experiencing in a game, especially a game that has a lot of translations and stuff, may be different than somebody that is speaking a different language.
4967625	4985550	And so for those games that have enough reviews, where the threshold is, I think, at least 2,000 reviews total, and of those, at least 200 written in a particular language, those are going to be the ones that kind of split out those reviews by region so that
4985530	5011572	you get a better understanding based on your region you know how the game is like say for example i was playing a jrpg that had just horrible absolutely the worst translations altogether like an english speaker might say oh well this game sucks it's poorly translated where in like say if it was just japanese or something like that it could be just perfectly fine in which case that would not necessarily reflect their experience
5011552	5035602	and so that's kind of where the the breakdown is there and they've um they're trying to do that to improve their system for uh you know including like translations culture cultural references network connections in different regions of the world obviously a thing with servers everywhere so that could be a thing with ping being like really bad in specific spots so it's just to give you a better um a more accurate review for your area i guess
5036830	5038572	Yeah, I think it's good.
5038592	5049287	They're kind of trying to do some things, especially with, you know, when people want to review bomb shit and, you know, like that you can sort of look at it or a game that's had a journey like No Man's Sky.
5049867	5051470	Very poorly reviewed when it came out.
5051490	5053632	We all know what we know the journey of No Man's Sky by now.
5053672	5055415	Now it's received very well.
5055775	5057117	You know, maybe you want...
5057097	5070914	Your review perspective to really only consider what's happened since the last patch or how people feel about, or the other way around, quite frankly, Final Fantasy XIV, not having a lot of great news around it lately, just with this latest expansion.
5070934	5078443	And now they've ceased and desisted a very popular role-playing mod that has a lot of people pissed and are now review bombing.
5078463	5082267	Not that I think review bombing is a legitimate tactic to take against companies.
5082307	5085852	I think it's silly, but it certainly does get attention, I guess.
5085992	5087053	So, yeah.
5087033	5091578	But it does also create a lot of noise when you're really trying to figure out what's going on with a particular game.
5091739	5093891	So, yeah.
5093911	5094917	Anyway, be interesting.
5095370	5102522	Well, I can't wait to see how this game reviews because y'all haven't shut the fuck up about it for about seven years.
5102542	5106569	But Hollow Knight Silksong, Loki referenced this earlier in the show.
5106589	5108873	It did show up at Gamescom opening night live.
5109174	5113281	And then we got a specific sort of announcement release trailer that came later in the week.
5113301	5117328	And Silksong is coming real soon, like two weeks away.
5117348	5119572	Silksong, September 4th.
5119552	5123518	So by the next time we have an Orange Lounge Radio, you will all have played Silksong.
5123598	5128966	Well, maybe not all of you, but some of you that have been chasing this game will have had your chance to play Silksong.
5129406	5137999	And apparently the game is available to play at Gamescom or was at Nintendo and Xbox booths, so I haven't heard a lot of the hands-on stuff, but that's...
5137979	5139060	That's pretty interesting.
5139080	5141823	So yeah, that game is finally coming out, and I'm sure it'll be good.
5142304	5147410	A lot of the stuff, I just give this game shit because the internet has sort of done this.
5147470	5149693	They've turned this into a thing.
5150133	5155580	You know how these... On the internet, we tend to turn things into a thing that maybe don't need to be a thing?
5155600	5158303	The release of Hollow Knight Silksong became a thing.
5158323	5162087	And now it's no longer going to be a thing because it's finally fucking coming out.
5162348	5163649	Well, you know...
5164034	5165837	We go through different eras in life.
5165917	5167400	We had the Battletoads era.
5167961	5169223	We had the Silksong era.
5169363	5169804	That's right.
5171667	5178079	We can now all move towards Elder Scrolls 6.
5178199	5179622	How about Metroid Prime 4?
5179762	5182326	Because suddenly Nintendo's not talking about it anymore.
5182346	5183308	Have you noticed that?
5184537	5186740	Why did we get a whole direct?
5187381	5189123	They said that game is coming out in 2025.
5189764	5192408	We get a whole direct about Kirby Air Ride.
5192428	5193990	What have they said on Metroid Prime 4?
5194751	5196935	Yeah, but Kirby Air Ride is right around the corner.
5197055	5199398	I know, but still, it's a little weird.
5199418	5200640	I don't know.
5200660	5201321	I think it's fine.
5202302	5204265	Bobby Blackwolf suggests GTA 6.
5204485	5205807	That's a good example too.
5207690	5210794	I just don't care when it's coming out at this point.
5210954	5213498	It'll come out when it comes out and we'll all celebrate it.
5213647	5214688	All right.
5214708	5217031	Well, some people might be celebrating this next news article.
5217351	5220555	DarkSakura.
5220575	5221516	Yeah.
5221856	5226662	Well, I think that this is definitely a cause for celebration.
5226962	5228804	I a thousand percent am behind this.
5229925	5234230	The Bungie CEO, Pete Parsons, is retiring because shit sucks.
5234811	5235231	Pretty much.
5238655	5239997	He spent.
5240097	5243080	Well, I mean, we know the thing about his cars, right?
5243414	5251341	about him spending like two and a half million on classic cars after the layoffs.
5251422	5255837	My favorite quote about him was said about his cars that I hope all of your cars break down.
5258163	5260946	But yeah, he's leaving.
5260966	5264009	He is leaving the studio.
5264249	5265751	He is going away.
5266552	5270076	And there was much rejoicing.
5270096	5270176	Yay.
5271637	5273599	How about this one, Julie?
5273659	5276462	May all of your roads have the construction of Highway 50.
5279405	5285672	I was thinking more of may all the roads have the quality of whatever that one leading to Long Beach is, but still...
5287053	5288115	You know which one I'm talking about?
5288135	5290418	Like 107 or whatever it is.
5290839	5292641	705, I think.
5292982	5294103	705, that's the one.
5294324	5295886	It's bumpy.
5296186	5297488	Never go on that road when you have to pee.
5298149	5299772	Anyway.
5299792	5300773	Because there is nowhere to stop.
5301514	5303637	So, back to this.
5304378	5306622	Taking over will be Justin Truman.
5307783	5311609	He's going to be taking over...
5312551	5313492	I don't know.
5314052	5322060	I hope he knows what he's in for because, well, Destiny 2 is kind of crap.
5323001	5325644	Marathon, in trouble.
5327225	5329447	And, oh my God.
5329848	5340718	I mean, and then on top of that, there was the situation that went on with the Sony acquisition.
5342504	5343826	It's looking crazy.
5344468	5346852	This just feels like accountability six months too late.
5347373	5355969	Obviously, there's been a lot of choices, trademark, when it comes to how things have been going with Destiny 2 and some of the recent stuff.
5356049	5359095	And then, you know, Marathon did not have...
5359075	5361539	A warmly received alpha in some ways.
5361559	5363963	And so there's a lot of things they're needing to work on.
5364124	5369493	And so it's, you know, who makes a lot of the decisions that go into how these games end up in the state that they're in?
5369513	5370094	The CEO.
5370535	5372899	And it's very rare that you see a CEO held accountable.
5372919	5382075	And especially as you started off talking about the optics of, I'm laying people off, but I also have to polish my 15 collector vehicles.
5382095	5382736	Just sucks.
5383177	5383277	Yeah.
5383257	5390811	So it's... I don't like to celebrate people losing their jobs, but this is one case where I might make an exception.
5391211	5393235	I think it's a healthy thing for this company right now.
5393275	5394457	They obviously need new leadership.
5394477	5400328	Well, except Truman may not be as great either.
5400348	5400709	Interesting.
5402873	5404776	He was...
5406359	5417096	He was the one who was also count at GDC 2023 where he warned about the dangers of over-delivery in the live service game because it was set too high of a standard.
5421844	5422004	Alright.
5423467	5424368	Yeah.
5425310	5429376	I hope all the people at the front lines at Bungie hang in there.
5429876	5436325	And, you know, obviously this isn't the fault of anybody working hard on, you know, our art or programming or, you know, whatever.
5436786	5442994	It just always sucks to see those are the people that then end up in these layoff situations, which is unfortunate.
5443034	5444396	It sucks.
5444416	5444657	All right.
5445318	5447801	Let's move on to something a little more happy, happy.
5448141	5448402	Loki?
5449583	5451646	Yeah, Pokemon World Championships.
5452087	5453629	So lots of announcements and stuff happening.
5455246	5457384	My Pokemans, let me show you them.
5457747	5458775	A little happy Pikachu.
5458795	5459400	Pika.
5460882	5465709	So let's kind of go down the list of some of the different things that they talked about and discussed.
5465749	5469215	So Pokemon Go, new updates of course with that.
5469235	5474783	So they had a trailer for Pokemon Go showing off some more legendary Pokemon.
5474803	5476806	So we have Eternalis.
5478048	5482014	Yeah, I played a fuck ton of Pokemon Go yesterday with that whole Eternatus.
5482034	5486601	I don't know how it's pronounced, but that was the raid I did at least 15 of them yesterday.
5486621	5487362	Yeah, it looks like.
5488203	5491128	Yeah, so we have that wrapped up today.
5491870	5496118	And of course, if you were there, you were able to get that Pokemon early.
5497300	5503852	Also, Pokemon TCG Pocket was getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall.
5504433	5510464	Mega versions of Altillaria, Gyarados, and Blaziken.
5510562	5514207	will be featured, I guess, in the app's new season.
5515109	5519014	Pokemon Unite is getting three more characters as well.
5519055	5524483	We have Emplorian, Delmise, and Vapirion coming to the game.
5525184	5527187	So that's cool.
5527327	5531773	The physical trading card game is also getting more Mega Evolutions.
5532374	5536300	They showed off new EX cards for Mega Charizard X.
5536786	5545972	Mega Gardevoir, Mega Lucario, and Mega Dragonite as well.
5545992	5548017	What about the Megazord?
5548037	5548860	No Megazords.
5549662	5551487	Damn, could you imagine that as a Pokemon?
5553340	5565295	That sounds really weird.
5565476	5572825	What else?
5577171	5578993	Pokemon Champions...
5579193	5596105	and many more.
5596085	5598989	of the World Championship Tournament in 2026.
5600170	5602934	Also announced is Pokemon XP.
5602954	5608541	It sounds like a new convention fan experience type thing.
5609142	5610664	It's supposed to be happening.
5610684	5616091	They said that apparently tickets will go on sale September 17th.
5617233	5624202	And it's going to feature panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.
5626375	5627476	I don't know.
5627496	5627796	Cool?
5628857	5629678	Lots of Pokemon stuff.
5631920	5632581	Yeah, it's a bummer.
5633842	5642350	Shane was trying to tell me that he might come out to the Pokemon World Championships at Chase Center, which would be great to see my friend, but I feel like the time frame is going to be terrible.
5642370	5647174	I heard it might be during DragonCon next year, which, nope, that's a hard no for me.
5647194	5650698	Next year's the 40th DragonCon, so I don't care what else is going on that weekend.
5650718	5651739	That's a must.
5652820	5655522	That's going to be a bummer if the timing doesn't work out.
5655502	5659448	I would have thought it might be a similar time frame where it's like one or two weeks before and I could swing that.
5659488	5660149	It's just San Francisco.
5660169	5661210	San Francisco is just a few hours away.
5661230	5661951	That's not that big a deal.
5662532	5665036	So it's not the drive that Portland was, that's for sure.
5665817	5666137	All right.
5667099	5674048	One game I am really looking forward to that is coming out, I think relatively soon, is the Mortal Kombat Collection.
5674770	5677574	And we just got announced this week, additional games.
5677594	5684243	You know, it was rumored for a while that some of the spinoff Mortal Kombat games, including Mythologies Sub-Zero and
5684223	5705269	and Special Forces may be included in
5705249	5706973	is out as well.
5707033	5712145	And then they are also adding what's called the WaveNet arcade version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
5712586	5714069	I have no idea what that was.
5714089	5718580	That implies that it must have been something where you could network arcades together or something.
5718820	5720344	I never experienced that.
5720364	5721707	So I'm curious to learn about it.
5721767	5722549	So that's pretty cool.
5722529	5749802	and this is again it's a digital eclipse game so it's that whole documentary style such as you know what you saw in the you know Tetris collection that they had recently and Atari 50 and those types of games really I think it's gonna be a great thing for this so yeah I will definitely pick this game up that's the Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection available pretty much everywhere on September 30th all right well since we're bringing up retro games what a great time for this segment let's get into this
5760110	5767499	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5767960	5770964	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5772205	5778373	Alright, and DarkSakura is stepping into the gaming vault and finding a game for us to celebrate tonight.
5778413	5779655	DarkSakura, what did you pick for us?
5780436	5784621	Excuse me, I have to dust off some cobwebs for this one even though it wasn't super long ago.
5785442	5786944	The game is called Off.
5788747	5790570	Do we remember off, everybody?
5790970	5797920	We had this before we had... Why can't I think of the name?
5797940	5798781	Because Deltarune.
5800384	5801165	Oh, Undertale.
5802066	5802987	Yeah.
5803007	5805131	I was thinking Claire Obscure because of all the French.
5805151	5806873	But anyway, I'll let you do your thing.
5807596	5811104	So Off came out in 2008.
5811225	5826280	It was a roleplay game that was done by a Belgian team called Unproductive Funtime that consisted of Mortis Ghost, also Martin Dioris, and is it
5826260	5828203	It's just this alias, or is it Elias?
5828404	5830027	I think it's Elias Conrad Coldwood.
5832130	5833312	I mean, he's Belgian.
5833953	5849280	So it's about this human-ish entity called the Batter, who is on a sacred mission to, quote, purify the world of Off, basically ending eternal oblivion.
5850442	5856733	So he goes to these four different zones in this world and reveals more about the world and combats.
5857895	5860420	Well, it got a big cult following.
5860700	5864367	I even played a fan translation back in the day.
5865629	5872184	And it did get its official fan translation in 2011.
5873287	5877536	So we are still past the 10-year period, even with the English translation.
5878539	5882668	But I remember everybody was freaking into this.
5882688	5883570	Everybody.
5884377	5908377	Actdeft.com
5908357	5920028	But Off has a system where your character is able to attack once a cooldown has passed, meaning that you can attack each other at the same time even enemies can.
5920048	5924340	So it's encouraged that you make fast decisions.
5924320	5946092	you can do like an auto option so it's basically just auto battler you also have an element system so instead of like you know earth wind fire water soul or whatever you have smoke metal plastic meat and sugar
5947439	5948060	Interesting, huh?
5949021	5956108	So you go through four different zones that are labeled 0 through 3, and then you have a fifth one called The Room, which is the final act of the game.
5957249	5966418	And it's only accessible once you have Zodiac cards that are acquired from different zones' guardians when they die.
5967419	5976248	And you go between them on a map that's called Nothingness.
5977493	5994237	and the other thing is that you have a whole lot of puzzles some multi-digit passwords that you enter into a giant keypad missing book pages repeating room puzzles you go through multiple instances of the same room in the right order to escape
5994588	5995892	So all kinds of stuff.
5996172	6001587	But at any rate, the batter is a man in a baseball uniform who is out to purify the world.
6001888	6006100	He gets guidance from a talking cat called the Judge.
6006120	6006420	That's it.
6006440	6007824	My next cat's going to be called the Judge.
6008907	6009930	Not really.
6009910	6013497	You have to kill specters to purify the zone.
6014458	6017384	And then the guardian, you put them down and you keep going.
6018826	6023655	But after each zone is purified, there are scenes of a sick boy named Hugo.
6024617	6030568	So there's something about a connection between this boy and the zones.
6032118	6042651	I'm not going to spoil the game in case someone, but the last zone is very much a series of non-linear puzzles that are supposed to belong to the boy Hugo.
6043872	6048939	And he's got some very resentful feelings.
6048959	6058951	So you have a special ending where you can side with the judge, or you can side with the batter.
6058971	6061534	I'm not going to say what you're doing with the two, but there is a
6062307	6065490	There is a difference of opinion.
6066051	6071396	And then you have a joke ending that involves space apes and it's very reminiscent of the Silent Hill dog ending.
6073578	6077662	So as far as this was developed, this was made with RPG Maker 2023.
6077702	6082187	And it was just made by Mortis and his buddies.
6082307	6083948	Well, you know, they were living together.
6086751	6087572	It
6088784	6096094	He lists things like Killer7, Silent Hill 2, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid 2, and an Agatha Christie novel.
6096174	6099939	And then there were none and missed as inspirations.
6099959	6103443	And it was a very spontaneous development period.
6103463	6108690	He did a demo on a small internet forum and people liked it.
6108710	6110893	So he decided to release a full game.
6110873	6115819	and then there were the English translations that were out by September 8th, 2021.
6117081	6119604	So there is going to be a remaster of OFF.
6120265	6131999	It was announced this year and the original composer of the 2008 release, which is Coldwood, said he would not be involved in the development.
6133541	6140610	The publisher is Fangamer and they offered to reuse Coldwood's music but he refused to
6140590	6142153	Do it to be nervous about signing.
6142734	6149407	So we'll have a new soundtrack for the remaster composed by seven different composers, including Toby Fox.
6149427	6152913	So we'll probably have a version of Megalopolis in it somewhere.
6153074	6154937	Megalovania, sorry.
6156031	6160803	and Lee Morse's rendition, If You Want the Rainbow.
6162547	6172150	It's slated, there is a Switch version that is slated for quarter one, 2026 and a physical copy.
6172383	6178051	But yeah, the game has been well praised for story, characters, atmosphere.
6180154	6188245	Heidi Klempz of PC Gamer called it a memorable and haunting RPG filled with tricky puzzles, bizarre symbolism, and challenging thematic elements.
6189086	6193733	So yeah, it has...
6194236	6197865	A huge, you know, it had a huge fan base on Tumblr, believe it or not.
6197885	6199328	That's actually where I heard about it.
6199849	6209292	And it was the sixth most reblogged game of 2013, with the other five being AAA games.
6209312	6209893	So there you go.
6210314	6210675	Off.
6211718	6218327	Alright, very timely pick with that remaster on the way too, I was kind of like, oh that kind of worked out conveniently, didn't it?
6218788	6236173	I hadn't thought of this game in a little bit, and then I was, believe it or not, I was looking up games made with RPG Maker And I saw it pop up on this, I was like, holy shit, yeah, I remember Off, and that's why I went for it Okay, no, it's a good pick, good times Any of y'all in chat play it?
6236812	6242339	I'm going to... Well, let's look at the chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6242519	6243981	No, there's more people talking about Undertale.
6244021	6247245	Dr. Tetsuya says, hadn't heard of it, also missed the whole Undertale thing.
6247785	6254574	So, well, that's... Especially with Remaster on the way soon, a great time to experience it.
6254594	6258178	Well, here, I absolutely recommend...
6259036	6260601	Go ahead and play it.
6260721	6261202	Play it now.
6261905	6263469	It was a treasure.
6263750	6266017	It was very weird, but very good.
6266117	6268043	Quite surrealist in aspects.
6268625	6268725	Yeah.
6269347	6269768	Good times.
6270609	6273772	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.
6273792	6278738	We're going to talk about some other things that are happening in the industry that you might have missed.
6278899	6281502	And we're going to get to the Lister Roundtable pretty soon here.
6281522	6285106	If you want to call us on Discord, vognetwork.com.
6285186	6290813	I would also encourage you to join Discord so you can talk to us throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.
6291554	6294898	Because we actually have a channel for convention talk.
6294878	6318962	and so Bobby and I being at DragonCon we will be sure to post updates so the cosplay came up earlier in the show I'll post a picture of it but it's only going to be on Discord so there's your I guess motivation I'm sure there'll be one on my socials too to be real but you should still join our Discord VOGnetwork.com slash Discord and check out the conventions channel this week from DragonCon and if you all are going to be there again I hope to see you at the Thursday panel or so I mean
6318942	6319663	Just ask.
6319703	6324230	As busy as I am, Saturday is really my worst day.
6324310	6328936	I have worst, best in many ways, but also worst because it's three panels back to back.
6328956	6329818	So my most busy day.
6330519	6335225	The other days I should be able to do an impromptu meetup like at the arcade or something.
6335325	6338730	So conventions channel is a great place to find me over at vognetwork.com.
6339311	6341474	Okay, let's get into rapid fire news.
6341534	6343397	I think Jamie, you're going to go first tonight, right?
6344440	6345583	Sure, yeah.
6345623	6348470	So my favorite band ever in the universe, Gorillaz.
6348831	6351437	Not the Gorillaz, just Gorillaz.
6352299	6354384	So get it right, people, or I will find you.
6358374	6360238	Well, it was...
6360218	6367052	It was announced that Gorillaz is coming to Fortnite.
6368695	6372343	So they will be the next Fortnite festival headlining act.
6372924	6380640	So the characters will appear as in-game skins and some of their music will be available for festival as well.
6382392	6402865	and yeah, the thought is and this is just the speculation on it is that 2D and Noodle will be in the shop and Murdoch and Russell will be available for Festival Pass so of course you know I'm going to have all of it forever so yeah
6404752	6408903	I'm looking forward to playing the songs in Festival because that seems, yeah, almost even.
6409103	6414176	I want so badly for them to put Oil in it, the duet with Stevie Nicks.
6415660	6415860	Mmm.
6417304	6418407	This song is so good.
6419630	6421174	All right, Loki, what do you have?
6421897	6431408	Alright, so Shinobi The Art of Vengeance is getting Sega Villain Stage DLC, and they announced that it's going to have three guest villains.
6431428	6435613	One of those guest villains is Dr. Eggman of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.
6436654	6437355	That's all we know.
6438136	6441019	That sounds interesting, Dr. Eggman in a Shinobi game.
6441820	6442761	Why not?
6442781	6443202	Why not?
6443222	6443763	It's Sega.
6444063	6444684	It's Sega.
6445204	6445625	I love it.
6445645	6446706	You know they'll make it work.
6447327	6451712	I know another game I'd like to see Dr. Eggman in, and that would be Overwatch 2.
6452433	6453975	Somehow I don't think that'll happen, though.
6453995	6460763	But Overwatch 2 is getting a new season, Season 18, starting really in just a couple days, August 26th.
6461343	6469673	And a pretty major change, and Jason referenced this in the intro tonight, but just to make it official, Overwatch 2 is going to change matchmaking
6469653	6486480	DarkSakura,
6486460	6505212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6505394	6508558	We're like playing Widowmaker on controller versus keyboard and mouse.
6508919	6510301	Two very different experiences.
6510321	6516109	And I believe if I remember right, you have a little bit of assist with aiming on controller that doesn't exist on keyboard mouse.
6516549	6518011	So, you know, some things to consider.
6518412	6520275	But that's, yeah, that's pretty cool.
6520395	6522097	I haven't played Overwatch 2 in a long time.
6522197	6526423	I kind of, I want to, but do you know, you know what stops me at this point?
6526403	6555128	well maybe I need to look into it I can't mask my battle tag name if I could do that I would play it again because I now use RobRob as my name and I don't want I don't necessarily want Overwatch shitlords knowing my name and I guess I should have known better when I checked my battle tag but since my entire online is like RobRob like yeah I don't know maybe I'm being silly but keyboard and mouse on a console is definitely not silly I'm excited for that
6556475	6560825	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out this week.
6560845	6563390	Loki, what's coming out in the US?

6984256	6988201	Alright, well we have just, actually I don't think we have any stories left.
6988301	6991345	I think that was the end of what we had slotted for you.
6991786	6993268	So we'll move over to Lister Roundtable.
6993288	6998895	If you guys have any questions for us, why don't you ask them in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6999656	7001098	I will also open it up.
7001298	7004362	I don't know if we had any emails, but I'll check in.
7004442	7005083	Nope.
7005063	7007227	Somebody had said... We ain't found shit.
7007367	7011616	Somebody had said that they emailed us on Bobby's show and I didn't see it.
7011636	7014942	So participate at orange.trader.com is the place to send emails.
7015303	7016225	Just double check that email.
7016245	7020693	If it's a real email, just free forwarded it because everything that was in there looked like it had been spam.
7020714	7021074	I'm sorry.
7021275	7021735	Yeah.
7021756	7023038	So, all right.
7023018	7026722	Um, so we do have a caller and we haven't talked to this person in a little while.
7026782	7028964	So let's go to Skype.
7029405	7030726	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
7030746	7032208	Who's this?
7032228	7033609	Oh, hey, everybody.
7033689	7035171	It's the one and only Ranma.
7035731	7037153	How is everybody doing tonight?
7037173	7038014	Fantastic.
7038034	7038394	How are you?
7038414	7038854	Invited you.
7041697	7044040	Well, as you must know.
7044881	7045902	Love you mean it.
7045922	7047203	Love you mean it.
7047638	7049420	You know about that?
7049440	7053906	Chad is apparently telling me that my brain malfunctioned and I said Skype.
7053926	7056350	When you say one thing for 15 years, habits are hard to break.
7056590	7058432	Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord.
7059674	7062578	Ranma, you look like you're in New Digs now.
7062598	7066263	No, this is the same place I've been in for the last year or so.
7066443	7067264	New Light?
7068406	7073353	Yeah, I was too lazy to get up and turn on the ceiling light, that's all.
7073373	7074013	Oh, okay, gotcha.
7074154	7076036	Alright, well to what do we owe the privilege tonight?
7076056	7076717	What's on your mind?
7077524	7081235	Yeah, there's something that you brought up early on in the show.
7081937	7089340	Something about Saturday morning Mega Mix beat-em-up Smash game.
7090467	7096093	Oh yeah, our little fantasy for a, I don't know, Saturday morning showdown or whatever we're going to call it.
7096434	7102200	Actually, there was a game called Saturday Night Slammasters that Capcom did that was a wrestling thing in the Street Fighter era.
7102220	7105644	But like Saturday morning Smackdown or something along those lines.
7105865	7111131	But we don't want it to be restricted to Saturday morning because like somebody pointed out, He-Man was a primetime cartoon.
7111371	7113854	You can't have all the Nickelodeon shit in there necessarily.
7114394	7115776	Childhood chaos.
7116136	7116677	Oh, there you go.
7116697	7117137	I like that.
7117198	7117918	Childhood chaos.
7117938	7118399	That's a good one.
7118779	7119360	Anyway.
7120623	7123166	I want to make a nomination.
7123226	7125949	This goes on the list of OLR Dream Games.
7125989	7128893	Okay, step before the council and make your suggestion.
7131436	7135340	The council will now hear from Ranma, citizen of New York.
7137022	7142108	I want this to be an OLR Dream Game.
7143100	7152958	50 bucks if anyone knows that reference YYR is very busy though he's got a child now he can't keep making our wishes come true he has his own projects he wants to work on too
7153597	7157641	And to be fair, Loki also has other projects because Loki did do Pixel Poops number two.
7157661	7162046	And also this is like a million, billions of dollars worth of licensing.
7162206	7172117	The licenses are going to make this hard to be an indie game, but we can still say it's an OLR dream game that we need a AAA studio to produce.
7172457	7181967	This is the Ubisoft, if you want us to ever forgive you, spend the money on this instead of AI slop, that would be the type of thing we would need.
7182571	7199415	please do not get me started on AI they've rolled out perplexity to everybody at work and I'm just like I don't even know what the fuck that is and I don't want to know it's another I don't want to know I can't, no comment
7199952	7203098	I mean, look, it doesn't matter where you work.
7203259	7205884	Your job is looking at how can AI help us.
7205904	7207427	It doesn't matter where you work.
7207647	7214280	And even if you're at a store or a place you wouldn't think, like retail, they're still looking at how is AI going to help us.
7214300	7215843	They're all looking at it.
7216204	7218248	It's just, it is what it is.
7218228	7221054	It's like when computers first came out.
7221074	7222116	I've heard it compared to that.
7222136	7230193	There was a time, believe it or not, there was a day when we didn't have computers, and then computers became personal computers, and that changed a lot of industries as we know it.
7230273	7232437	No, we had computers, but they were human.
7233018	7233820	Yes.
7233840	7234662	Well, yeah, that's true.
7234742	7238650	But anyway, AI is a similar sort of thing, so...
7238630	7238991	Anyway.
7239752	7243839	I can go on a tangent about that, but this is not about that.
7243859	7249069	I just wanted to say that if we're going to go down this route, we need the Smurfs.
7249810	7251032	We need Alf.
7252134	7253697	Let's see, what else do we need?
7253897	7256301	If we got Alf, we'd be the official game of Blue Sky.
7257343	7261110	And we also need a kid video for intermissions and bonus rounds.
7262879	7263640	I support it.
7264902	7265622	Those are good picks.
7265983	7270989	Especially if the Smurfs is Gargamel's cat would be the character I would nominate.
7271850	7272771	Muppet Babies.
7274213	7275475	Oh my god, yes.
7275495	7276416	Muppet Babies.
7276436	7283124	No, their playroom needs to be a stage and you have the nanny legs come in every now and then and change the stage.
7283905	7287029	Nanny's gonna be a stage fatality.
7288070	7290313	Wait, when did our game have fatalities?
7291014	7291114	Yeah.
7292022	7299173	I mean, when you're fighting the boss, the screen can change.
7299253	7303900	Just say it.
7303920	7305323	I love it.
7305783	7310651	Also, the other thing is that like the Muppet Babies, I think the character from Muppet Babies should be Skeeter.
7311252	7313756	And in every introduction, it should be, who the fuck are you?
7319565	7320426	Oh, God.
7321722	7322443	Oh, Rob.
7324445	7325686	Oh, Rob.
7327268	7330691	I mean, literally, they erased Skeeter from the reboot, if I remember right.
7330711	7332373	Didn't they replace her with somebody else?
7332753	7334174	Like a new character?
7334194	7336136	The name Skeeter is a little bit questionable.
7336176	7337358	I'm just going to say that right now.
7337378	7341001	Again, the official game of Blue Sky, if we had Skeeter playable in the game.
7342042	7343163	Well, what about Scooter?
7344024	7345446	Sure, they could have twin tests.
7345466	7348449	Scooter's actually a character in the actual level.
7348469	7349890	Scooter's a real person.
7350629	7358299	Go back and watch Muppet Babies and pretend that Skeeter is a figment of Scooter's imagination and the show takes a whole new angle.
7359942	7361504	Also smoke weed beforehand.
7362746	7363907	Allegedly.
7365509	7369234	I want you to know I do this at work on my breaks.
7369355	7372158	I go on YouTube Smoke weed and watch Muppet Babies?
7372279	7374822	What kind of fucking workplace are you at?
7374842	7375523	Sign me up.
7376465	7377386	Are you hiring?
7378268	7385339	It's a workplace where you get three weeks of mandatory PTO, just saying.
7385599	7390246	Maybe it's just those edibles, you know, when you can slide it into your lunch and nobody knows the difference.
7390767	7399300	There are times I will sit there and watch YouTube videos of classic 80s commercials, okay?
7402503	7421153	and there are people who have uploaded their entire Saturday morning cartoon playlist with the commercials intact I fucking love that shit when they do that they keep the commercials intact absolutely quick what's a commercial jingle that comes to mind from the 80s oh god
7422230	7424755	I try to block some of this out when I'm not at work.
7425456	7433833	The only one for me is an extremely regional thing, like you East Coasters aren't going to get it, but it's Merry Christmas from Thrifties and Payless.
7433954	7435397	Like, y'all aren't going to understand.
7435417	7437060	I had never heard that before, you know that.
7437080	7438042	You're never going to understand.
7438262	7438543	I have.
7439164	7440206	Yeah, see, Loki understands.
7440226	7443613	I mean, I know what Thrifties is, but because I've had the ice cream.
7444910	7454129	For the record, before Rite Aid went away to Dodo Bird, I did see a lot of thrifty stuff in my local store before it became a cheap supermarket.
7454149	7457396	Well, because the ice cream was the ice cream of legends.
7458077	7460943	And thrifty ice cream, I believe, still lives on to this day.
7461003	7465753	Whoever bought Rite Aid, Walgreens, you can still find thrifty ice cream, but...
7465733	7489108	find me a fucking thrifty ice cream counter those are we have a few Rite-Aids aren't completely gone here and so we have a few Rite-Aids just a few that are left that have the counters in them that is the stuff of fucking legends right there and uh yeah Ranmari says uh thrifty cylindrical scoop that's right they had the the perfect little you can buy those on Amazon you can yeah
7491586	7499376	Okay, I do remember one regional jingle for New York Telephone before it became Verizon, and they would play it on all their commercials.
7500798	7502981	See, I wouldn't know this, being a California kid.
7503862	7504743	What?
7504763	7506205	What, you're gonna tell us that and not sing it?
7506305	7507487	You're gonna tell us that and not sing it?
7510130	7510230	Okay.
7510250	7512994	We're all connected, New York Telephone.
7515857	7516318	Okay.
7516338	7516699	Sold.
7516819	7517460	I'll buy five.
7517480	7519382	Okay.
7520948	7522851	Come on, we're 80s kids.
7523431	7524853	We're 80s kids.
7525074	7527036	There is one jingle from the 80s.
7527056	7527377	I know.
7527777	7530481	We should all know.
7530501	7534546	I know one, though, from Mobile, and it was kind of all over the area.
7534566	7536108	It was for Cockerell's Body Shop.
7537290	7537390	What?
7537410	7539393	And it was very country.
7541976	7542917	Wow.
7544520	7545220	Yeah.
7545281	7548945	Cockerell's Body Shop, we love your automobile.
7550187	7550888	That's what it was.
7552285	7582292	Pussy Cow, Pussy Cow, Pussy Cow
7582272	7586602	Dan has shown me these old commercials, by the way.
7586622	7587684	The pussy cow commercials?
7589328	7589549	Yes.
7589569	7593177	I barely remember he showed me one once.
7594928	7623957	Rob, my brother in Christ
7624358	7627622	You got me thinking of the Golden Girls now, because let's be real.
7627922	7632128	Most of us thought they said a heart attack, okay?
7632808	7633830	Most of us thought that.
7634991	7636833	Oh, shut the fuck up, Loki.
7636934	7638335	You found one?
7638355	7650250	Okay, so I apologize because you guys on Discord won't hear this, but I have to play this for the live audience because this is so fucking legendary.
7650991	7651992	Here it is.
7652012	7652313	Here it is.
7652333	7653814	This is the Pussy Cow commercial, okay?
7653834	7654315	You ready?
7656438	7659002	Here's Cal Worthington and his dog Spot!
7659022	7662727	Wait, why did you pick a commercial where Cal Worthington doesn't have a fucking shirt on?
7662887	7663989	This man is like in his 70s.
7664029	7665310	He's the first one that was on the list.
7665330	7666652	This man's in his 70s.
7666732	7667694	Alright, anyway.
7667714	7669436	If you want it better, buy Go See Cal.
7669616	7671759	You're the guy we satisfy.
7671779	7672841	Go See Cal.
7672861	7674143	Give a new car to your wife.
7674163	7675565	She will love you all her life.
7675585	7676226	Go See Cal.
7676246	7676927	Go See Cal.
7676947	7677608	Go See Cal.
7679350	7679630	See?
7680352	7681253	It says Pussy Cal.
7681774	7683576	Tell me it doesn't say Pussy Cal.
7684990	7690057	I almost spit my water across my screen.
7690077	7692360	I almost did that.
7692380	7693641	Pussy cow.
7698087	7699990	I will watch this later.
7700010	7707259	The top comment on that, if you look at the top comment from three years ago on that video, for years, I always thought it was pussy cow.
7707319	7710103	I had no idea it was pussy cow.
7715129	7716831	Rob is losing his shit live on air.
7717472	7719535	I even have the wrong shot.
7719575	7721078	I used the shot that took Loki out.
7721218	7723822	I can't help it.
7725504	7726986	It's the pussy cow of my childhood.
7727006	7728348	What can I say?
7729009	7731633	You never forget your first pussy cow.
7731973	7733956	You never forget your first pussy cow.
7737021	7738723	Is that our new catchphrase?
7738923	7740065	Maybe.
7740426	7743473	Maybe that's an unlockable character is Cal Worthington and his dog Spot.
7743493	7743713	All right.
7743754	7746900	Anyway, rest in rest in peace.
7746961	7747442	Rest in peace.
7749286	7751230	Anyway.
7751330	7751911	Okay.
7752112	7754317	Ranma, where are you going to take the show next?
7754337	7756481	You've made us go down the rabbit hole of pussy cow.
7756602	7757303	Now what?
7760017	7770988	I'm glad I called in before I decided to do an edible or something else I'm kind of glad I did Why aren't you sharing with me?
7772791	7773852	Because I love and trust you.
7774794	7775655	Come to my house right now.
7777938	7781002	I should do it because I just recently restocked.
7781022	7786489	You should, you should, I can't say, but you should definitely try to come to Fanime next year.
7786949	7788211	Strong wink, strong nudge.
7788431	7790094	You should definitely try to come to Fanime next year.
7792497	7794259	Funny you should mention that.
7795808	7803757	I have been saying off and on for the last few years that there are conventions 20 years ago I wanted to go to, but I could not afford them because finances.
7804357	7813388	Now that I'm in a position where I can take the time off that I want, and I have the money to go to these conventions, and I really haven't.
7813408	7816431	I decided to do a couple of trips to Japan and still go to cons.
7817052	7819234	I'm still putting together 2026.
7819670	7822995	I think maybe a reunion tour might be in order.
7823015	7823455	Love it.
7824216	7824577	Love it.
7825698	7826139	Definitely.
7827861	7828262	Alright.
7828462	7832908	Or you could take your bestie in the entire universe, DarkSakura, to Japan with you.
7836794	7847989	Well, I mean, I am going in 2026 because my con kid wants to go and she really loves her Kirby, so...
7849252	7850515	I would love to go.
7850736	7852199	Tell me when you do that.
7852259	7853462	If I have the money for it.
7853482	7859938	Tell me when you do that because if Shad's still there, I might go and I'll try to time it.
7860139	7861843	But it depends on if he's still there or not.
7862988	7865092	Even if he's there or not, you should still go.
7865192	7868257	I know, I do want to go.
7869459	7873186	We were looking at doing a cruise, a second cruise next year, and I don't think it's going to pan out.
7873206	7876291	We're on a waiting list that I hear is hundreds of people long, so I don't think that's going to pan out.
7876311	7878615	So we might have the bandwidth to do something big.
7878635	7879136	So we'll see.
7879176	7880358	I don't want to get too ahead of myself.
7880519	7886970	I just know that I want to go to Kyoto for the Miyako Odori.
7891135	7893337	Alright, Ranma, we gotta wrap up the show.
7893658	7895159	And you're making me want to spend money.
7895179	7896380	Which is, I should let you go.
7896661	7898643	But do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?
7899744	7901265	I don't want to grow up.
7901285	7902707	I'm a Toys R Us kid.
7902747	7905369	There's a million Toys R Us that I can play with.
7905690	7909353	From book to trains to video games.
7909774	7910614	There is.
7910655	7913618	Rob doesn't remember the lyrics.
7913898	7919944	And in Japan, you still run the tags to the front at Toys R Us.
7920144	7921125	That's something
7922185	7925048	And in Japan, Toys R Us still exists.
7925969	7931795	I was in Ikebukuro walking through Sunshine City and I saw the Toys R Us.
7932215	7935399	I stared and I wiped a tear away.
7935439	7939022	I was just like... But if it doesn't smell like Toys R Us, it won't work for me.
7939222	7943547	And I'm just telling you, Toys R Us had a very distinctive smell of Warehouse and Kmart.
7943567	7946430	Ranma, you know the place I have to go to.
7948992	7949433	Donkey?
7949453	7949593	Donkey?
7950451	7975429	Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun
7975831	7977133	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
7977173	7979095	Trust me, I'm so down.
7979916	7983680	I went to a Mega Donkey in Nagoya and found Choco Cat stuff.
7984621	7993492	Yeah, I was thinking of the Mega Donkey, because I mean, I would probably have to go to Tokyo first before I make my way to Kyoto.
7994453	7998798	But on the plus side, there's hundreds of Don Quixote stores all over, most are 24 hours.
8000460	8001461	Yeah.
8002362	8004184	I want to go to that one in particular.
8004299	8027320	but you definitely gotta go to one Akihabara though tons of anime stuff well and then I want to go to where the luxury stores are in Shibuya, basically the pawn stores that sell luxury goods oh yes yes yes yes I mean something about getting an Hermes bag for 4 grand instead of 20 grand
8028430	8031833	Not that I have that money anyway, but it'd be nice to think about it for five minutes.
8032694	8036718	Alright, Ranma, we gotta wrap it up, but do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?
8037739	8042323	Toys R Us Jingle was my final thought, and then we just kind of derailed yet again, because I love you guys.
8042663	8042943	I know.
8043064	8043744	Well, I love you too.
8043784	8044405	Thanks for calling in.
8044425	8045205	It's always good to hear from you.
8046547	8047107	Alright, take care.
8047127	8047588	Take care, buddy.
8047888	8048088	Bye.
8048569	8048649	Bye.
8049770	8052772	Alright, well, it's time for us to give our final thoughts.
8052792	8053153	That's alright.
8053233	8055535	Actually, let me check in real quick, Loki, with any last-minute stories.
8057101	8057722	I didn't think so.
8057742	8058283	I have nothing.
8058603	8059003	I looked.
