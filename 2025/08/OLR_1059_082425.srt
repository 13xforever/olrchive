1
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:15,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwatch 2 consoles cross-play segment stats and player pools based off the use of a controller or keyboard and mouse.

2
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:24,087
[SPEAKER_00]: When I played Rocket League Sideswipe, I frequently wondered how many people thought I was cheating, because I could manipulate my car faster and more precisely using an analog stick instead of touching the screen alone.

3
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:27,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Though this was getting through the starter tiers, where all matter of excuses fly.

4
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:28,472
[SPEAKER_00]: My body was ready.

5
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:28,992
[SPEAKER_00]: No Johns.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:29,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fly.

7
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,695
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most wunderbar Deutsche Zeit of the year.

8
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:35,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this week's gaming news.

9
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now on the show, wherever gamers have voice...

10
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, you're not cheating.

11
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:59,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just really good at the video game.

12
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,926
[SPEAKER_05]: and 59 of our program.

13
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:06,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting with the scheduling is that we were off last week and we'll be off next week.

14
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is this is an island show.

15
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,081
[SPEAKER_05]: August is just a busy month, but we'll get into more of that in just a little bit.

16
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:15,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you all about the scheduling and why some pretty awesome reasons.

17
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:16,807
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

18
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here with you every week.

19
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And my co-host couldn't do it without the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:22,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

21
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:22,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

22
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:25,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Lynn's in the live stream.

23
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,721
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what we are.

24
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:27,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

25
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:27,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

26
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,543
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

27
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lasagna.

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is irrelevant.

29
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I don't have lasagna, but I do have coffee.

30
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:37,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that too.

31
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:39,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, coffee and lasagna.

32
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great combo.

33
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not drinking the coffee right now.

34
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:44,074
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

35
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,860
[SPEAKER_03]: That's if it was ladyfingers and coffee cream.

36
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:50,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Which tiramisu is my favorite dessert.

37
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to Boston cream pie.

38
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I got me thinking about desserts.

39
00:01:55,305 --> 00:02:02,736
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Stouffer's lasagna because we are trying to eat all the stuff in the freezer.

40
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: You got me thinking about desserts now and that's not a good thing.

41
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going like, remember all that weight I was going to lose before DragonCon?

42
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:14,595
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, my coffee is drunken out of a Michael Myers mug that says Slay All Day.

43
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

44
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:25,074
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's that season because the week before Labor Day is when Starbucks and obviously various other companies too really dunk in.

45
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just got a pumpkin drink at Dutch Bros and say pumpkin season is here.

46
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:29,481
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

47
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:30,623
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

48
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:32,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been to my house.

49
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,727
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it never not scary season?

50
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not pumpkin season.

52
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,213
[SPEAKER_03]: It's David S. Pumpkin's season.

53
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,235
[SPEAKER_05]: David S. Pumpkin's season.

54
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one and only, our own version of David S. Pumpkin's.

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why he doesn't wear the suit.

56
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

57
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm too fat for the suit.

58
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:51,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the suit.

59
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the suit.

60
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you did.

61
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,532
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't fit.

62
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:56,293
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't fit.

63
00:02:56,473 --> 00:03:00,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to be fair, it didn't fit when I bought it either.

64
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can't really gauge the size of those things.

65
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just...

66
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:11,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you bought it online, it probably came from another country where the sizing doesn't always line up.

67
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So, because I've had that problem a lot.

68
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:21,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it in person last year at the... Well, the building's torn down now.

69
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:27,952
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the husk of what is now a Spirit Halloween store.

70
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:30,735
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they tend to...

71
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:45,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Be Parasitic with all the different empty buildings, but yes, I bought it at a Spirit Halloween and I intended to wear it, it just doesn't, it wasn't, it just felt really cheap and it was also not fitting really well.

72
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,729
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of normal with anything that like you buy from there, it's not always going to fit.

73
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:53,053
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of like, oh yeah, one size fits all.

74
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

75
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:55,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

76
00:03:56,383 --> 00:04:09,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's food chat in our chat because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at â€“ well, almost every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show over at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

77
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's lots of great programming you can check out on VOG.

78
00:04:12,046 --> 00:04:13,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you all remember it's not just us and Bobby.

79
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We have other video gaming shows such as GameBooey.org, Video Game Podcast.

80
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:18,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Love those guys.

81
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,360
[SPEAKER_05]: We have shows about anime, Anime Jam Session.

82
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We have British television connoisseurs over British Invaders.

83
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:27,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope you'll check out all those great shows, especially on weeks where we're not here.

84
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You have plenty of other cool little things to check out.

85
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:37,943
[SPEAKER_05]: So going to our chat, because we are live, PodCulture says, I thought of Rob the other day because Costco had pallets of Starbucks pumpkin spice lattes.

86
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:41,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of surprised that Alan didn't text me a picture of that.

87
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:42,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

88
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,178
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've been very open about, I'm a type 2 diabetic, so I have to watch things like how many carbs and the sugars.

89
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So in reality, a Costco pallet of that is a bad idea.

90
00:04:53,284 --> 00:05:05,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I will usually, these days, ever since the diagnosis, I will allow myself one celebratory pumpkin spice latte the week of DragonCon, usually on the way to DragonCon, but I might do it on Tuesday because our coworkers are talking about doing something.

91
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can, when you order it, you can do something, you know, customize it so I get...

92
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:14,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I get half the sweetener in it, so it's a little less than normal.

93
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:17,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there is no sugar-free pumpkin at Starbucks.

94
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not just get sugar-free pumpkin spice syrup, which I find all the time at home goods in those places?

95
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:46,528
[SPEAKER_05]: and make it at home.

96
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:52,539
[SPEAKER_05]: SSH100 Matt says they have the New York State Fair and I've eaten a lot of insane snacks.

97
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant mozzarella stick rolled in fruity pebbles and another rolled in flaming hot Cheetos.

98
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,859
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had the State Fair here in California and all I heard about was how fucking expensive it was for that kind of stuff.

99
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:30,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

101
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:38,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they have like something that my son was describing like it was like a deep fried Twinkie hamburger or something like that.

102
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:42,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, like you've gone too far at that point.

103
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:43,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like...

104
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,112
[SPEAKER_03]: If they make a Twinkie Wiener sandwich, Weird Al will sue.

105
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,478
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have.

106
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, it's not food, it's video games.

107
00:06:52,562 --> 00:07:08,068
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into a video game talk and there was a big event that happened this week I'm going to have Loki jump into, but actually I wanted to ask you about this, DarkSakura, not to get too far into our gaming weeks, but I know you are a connoisseur yourself of Dead by Daylight, and I've been on a little bit of Dead by Hiatus, but

108
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they updated to the most...

109
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:56,348
[SPEAKER_05]: recent version of unreal it's one thing to watch like nick and prince or you stream it where like it doesn't look that different to me but when i look over my husband's shoulder i'm like this looks different to me somehow i don't know what it is like i don't know if it's just the eye for the fighter details but yeah i can tell it's different but then um he was telling me well you should patch your game and sign on because they are giving away five million blood points right now which i don't know how to quantify that for people not familiar with the game but it is a

110
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the cap of free leveling money.

111
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:01,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's it's a I'll put it this way.

112
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,025
[SPEAKER_03]: My pig was at and don't say nice level 69.

113
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, prestige 69, like level 20 something.

114
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:20,631
[SPEAKER_03]: When I applied that 5 million directly to her in the most optimized manner, I got up to prestige 70 for level 42.

115
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I got every survivor to level one that I own.

116
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't own a few of them at this point.

117
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I got every single one of them.

118
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:33,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I actually got a couple of the killers that I never want to play just to unlock their perks.

119
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:40,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I dumped a bunch into Billy and I dumped a bunch into Trapper just to get their perks in the pool, which is nice.

120
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

121
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:58,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Why'd they do that?

122
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:06,501
[SPEAKER_03]: which was an artifact on the loading screen that was part of the scaffolding holding up a street sign in the background of the lobby.

123
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:08,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes, because now it's an icon, right?

124
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:09,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally an icon.

125
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I have made icons of it, yes.

126
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I have icons that I made.

127
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,911
[SPEAKER_05]: A player icon, right?

128
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:17,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can get it as a player badge.

129
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:26,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those who are in chat, I will just use my little emote that I made of Jim Beam.

130
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:27,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim the Beam.

131
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:31,868
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also get a shirt that says RIP Jim the Beam.

132
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:33,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it myself.

133
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:34,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, back to this.

134
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:46,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were already things going on and they put out a fix for it and said that they were delaying more DLC to do a quality of life thing.

135
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:59,518
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happened at the 2v8, now I will rewind and say that I didn't exactly experience this, but it did happen when the 2v8 event came out on October 20th.

136
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an outage.

137
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:02,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Hundreds of people couldn't play.

138
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Matchmaking was having problems.

139
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:05,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Game wasn't launching.

140
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Login issues.

141
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:07,897
[SPEAKER_03]: High latency.

142
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I experienced the latency problem.

143
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I played for maybe two hours and then switched to, I think, Mass Effect.

144
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:20,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, the biggest way I get latency is input lag.

145
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I would rather just have the game be slow than have input lag.

146
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:32,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then there's seconds where I can't control my character because she's still walking based on the last command that I put in.

147
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was pretty crap.

148
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was really just a massive failure of launch.

149
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was scheduled to run from August 19th through the 2nd.

150
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still waiting to see if they're going to extend it.

151
00:10:51,985 --> 00:11:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: But as an apology to everybody, they have issued out 5 million blood points to everybody, which, as I recall, is the current cap for blood points.

152
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said it before, you can get a lot of levels with that.

153
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put it on so many different characters, but I'm trying to P100 my pig.

154
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I've P100 Meg.

155
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pig's turn.

156
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you have to claim this no later than September 2nd at 11 a.m.

157
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:24,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern Time.

158
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:34,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so they haven't said exactly what the issue was, but it did affect so much.

159
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It lasted about two hours, and I felt it.

160
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, though, is that if you are just thinking of coming back to Dead by Daylight, even if you don't play during this event, you can still get 50,000 blood points daily just by logging in and going into your inbox and claiming it.

161
00:11:55,405 --> 00:12:05,214
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also, I think, because a community thing was met, there's also some bonus badges and things that you can get for free.

162
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,937
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it will be in your inbox in-game.

163
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

164
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I logged in.

165
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't logged in in a while and collected a bunch of free stuff.

166
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, okay, neat.

167
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll play.

168
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:19,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one of these days I will give in to DarkSakura going, Rob, play.

169
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:20,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, play.

170
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:21,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You should play.

171
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:21,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Play.

172
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,733
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

173
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,538
[SPEAKER_03]: You should play tomorrow.

174
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,441
[SPEAKER_05]: No, tomorrow.

175
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:27,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Tuesday.

176
00:12:27,882 --> 00:12:31,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do after DragonCon at this point.

177
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:32,248
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

178
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:32,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Now.

179
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,932
[SPEAKER_05]: What about your subby?

180
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:35,974
[SPEAKER_05]: What about your subbython?

181
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm here doing your next little subbython.

182
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:43,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to not say it live, but now that you brought it up... Oh, my bad.

183
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:52,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having a subathon on my channel, DarkSakuraTTV, because I'm trying to raise money for my hotel room.

184
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:58,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have enough now, but I want to make sure I have extra money in case, you know, emergencies happen.

185
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:06,689
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's going to be the 13th, September 13th, which is a Saturday at 11 o'clock a.m.

186
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:08,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific time till 11 p.m.

187
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific time.

188
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can pay me to go longer.

189
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

190
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that during your last one.

191
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I did go longer.

192
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Rob, I went longer than I was paid to go.

193
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I opened my purse and dumped out all my bits and gave them to you.

194
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:23,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I went 14 hours.

195
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:24,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

196
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: You, too, can watch me be unintelligible at the 14-hour mark.

197
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:30,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the longest I could play a game.

198
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went longer also because Shay popped on.

199
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:34,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I'm playing with Shay.

200
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:36,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know Shay is a treasure.

201
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Shay is a small treasure.

202
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:41,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we gotta get into the gaming news.

203
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other quick things for your sub-a-thon, September 13th?

204
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:47,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Be there.

205
00:13:47,682 --> 00:14:14,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe my room will be clean and I can actually use my camera.

206
00:14:14,682 --> 00:14:17,066
[SPEAKER_05]: and just, you know, which makes sense.

207
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:21,192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in Europe and they're eight or nine hours ahead and they're not going to do it in the middle of the night.

208
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's going to be early.

209
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:26,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've got a lot of work commitments and things I have to do.

210
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:31,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could not really follow that until later, much later in the day.

211
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of had to look at the recaps.

212
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like when you look at the recaps, it's not as impactful as actually watching a lot of those trailers.

213
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried to go back and watch a few, but I will admit I didn't watch everything.

214
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:44,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, what were some of the things that caught your eye?

215
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: What should we be aware of from Gamescom?

216
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,172
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of things.

217
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:57,581
[SPEAKER_01]: There was even stuff that was in the pre-show as well that I don't think we have on this list here, but I can try to recall it from my memory.

218
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:05,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting things off in the most randomly possible way, the announcement of Bubsy 4D.

219
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about that.

220
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Who asked for this?

221
00:15:09,394 --> 00:15:11,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the game no one asked for.

222
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks cool.

223
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,260
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who asked for it?

224
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Atari.

225
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Atari asked for it.

226
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:18,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're like, hey, those kids are playing Bubsy.

227
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,409
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get in on that Bubsy train.

228
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:28,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when little Sarah was growing up, she used to play this game called Bubsy.

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do another Bubsy?

230
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:33,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We need our own mascot platformer.

231
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:34,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see who we got.

232
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:35,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubsy.

233
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubsy's got the stuff.

234
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we're at it, let's reboot Yars Revenge again.

235
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:44,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do it again.

236
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:45,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's bring back Yonoid.

237
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,382
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

238
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:47,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.

239
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,379
[SPEAKER_01]: The character that you don't have anymore, but you know.

240
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so they had that.

241
00:15:55,018 --> 00:16:10,601
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a really cool trailer for Densha Attack, which is this just absolutely insane anime jet set radio looking thing where you're a train that grinds rails and flies into the air and fights things.

242
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:11,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.

243
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:14,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me that, please.

244
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:15,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So that looked amazing.

245
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:18,733
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some other stuff too, but I don't remember what those were.

246
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:23,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the actual Gamescom stuff though, lots of announcements.

247
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:30,511
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest one, of course, is that, you know, Silksong still coming out this year.

248
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:39,405
[SPEAKER_01]: It was then later announced in their own like direct event that it's coming out very soon, actually, in just a couple weeks.

249
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:50,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Call of Duty Black Ops 7 has a gameplay trailer and it looks like some of the Far Cry Dream sequences and apparently this is something that was also in Black Ops 6.

250
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:53,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it looks fucking stupid, but you know, that's just me.

251
00:16:55,033 --> 00:17:09,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in my day when Call of Duty was a military shooter game, not this bullshit Fortnite shit, but apparently they're going all in on bullshit Fortnite shit, so...

252
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,941
[SPEAKER_01]: More power to them, I guess.

253
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:17,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had trailer for Lords of the Fallen 2, which looks awesome.

254
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited to see that.

255
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Sekiro No Defeat looks pretty awesome.

256
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:36,848
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the games I'm most excited about that was announced was LEGO Batman Legacy of the Dark Knight, which is kind of a brand new Batman LEGO game, because they haven't done that in like...

257
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: God, years, over 10 years.

258
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:46,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's cool about it though is it follows not only like the Arkham games, but it seems like the movies and like other stuff as well.

259
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:54,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a culmination of all of the Batman media empire, but now all together with the Lego humor and stuff.

260
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:58,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am 100% down to check that out.

261
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:58,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

262
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:24,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Warhammer 40k, Dawn of War 4 we got to see a trailer for that coming out next year also a new crossover with Monster Hunter Wilds I think they did this recently with Final Fantasy 14 now it's going the other way so now you have Final Fantasy 14 stuff coming into Monster Hunter Wilds so they showed off Chocobos and stuff like that that's coming in October

263
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:48,263
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Onimusha, The Way of the Sword Looks pretty cool, that's also set for next year We've got a trailer, which funny enough I actually saw this before I saw Opening Night Live But a trailer for Season 2 of Fallout, the TV show Looks great, I'm excited, it's supposed to be coming out in December So can't wait to see it, I will binge the hell out of that

264
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:55,377
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy Aria Snark saw that trailer and screencapped something and put it on her Instagram and said, this isn't a lot.

265
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:56,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's some fight going on.

266
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some like building looking thing and went, this is the empty grocery store behind my house.

267
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:05,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought that was so funny.

268
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Just LA things.

269
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:10,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what?

270
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta use what you got.

271
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:14,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's funny.

272
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:17,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I love seeing places that I know.

273
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:21,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I love seeing things, especially when they don't make any sense.

274
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:28,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, the famous one I can think of is that old 90s ABC TGIF show, Step by Step.

275
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:31,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Step by step a day, right?

276
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:31,777
[SPEAKER_05]: The Patrick Duffy show.

277
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:32,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

278
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Suzanne Somers.

279
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

280
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So the opening of that is them all getting on a roller coaster, right?

281
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And that roller coaster.

282
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:55,982
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:19:55,962 --> 00:20:20,164
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you ever watch the opening to that show and you see the ocean roaming up against that's all fucking CGI that's the parking lot for the theme park that they just it's so funny everyone's cars are underwater the worst part about that though is it's rotoed so bad so like as you're watching the ocean like the coastline just like keeps shifting like I remember that from watching that show like how ridiculous that looked it's like

284
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:23,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine, okay, this looks stupid, but okay.

285
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:30,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the great magic mountain flood of 1994, and Suzanne Somers had to row to- This is what happens, global warming, see?

286
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's hell happy, you know, but it's-

287
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:55,095
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

288
00:20:55,075 --> 00:21:04,495
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an announcement for John Carpenter's Toxic Commando that's expected out early next year as well.

289
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:10,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Death by Scrolling is a new game by Ron Gilbert.

290
00:21:11,043 --> 00:21:20,672
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit different style of game, but it's like a roguelite where the screen is constantly scrolling and apparently the Grim Reaper is trying to kill you as well during all this.

291
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:21,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That one looked interesting to me.

292
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:23,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That one caught my eye.

293
00:21:23,214 --> 00:21:24,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the name too.

294
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:26,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it looks interesting.

295
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:35,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Zero Parades, I guess, which is by the developers of Disco Elysium.

296
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:36,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else?

297
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:39,116
[SPEAKER_01]: The Darkest Files.

298
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:39,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember that.

299
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:44,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was the one that was, I think, like, you're like hunting Nazis or something like that.

300
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:49,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they came out and talked about how Nazis are bad, which, I mean, do we really need to say that?

301
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we really do nowadays.

302
00:21:51,472 --> 00:22:15,792
[SPEAKER_01]: another trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 now it's coming out October 21st Cinder City which apparently I guess it looks like Warframe I'm not familiar it's a new MMO shooter also Time Takers some third-person shooter game we had a new trailer for Silent Hill F that's showing off the the gameplay it's

303
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:39,282
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

304
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:50,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had La Divinia Comedia, and that looks like another Souls-like type game, so that's pretty cool.

305
00:22:51,123 --> 00:23:00,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Kronos the New Dawn, I swear the character in this reminds me of Bioshock's The Big Daddies, but yeah, it's a survival horror game, looks pretty cool.

306
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:05,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also being done by Bloober Team, and that is coming out.

307
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:10,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically enough, also in September, actually September 5th, so next week.

308
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:11,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting.

309
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:18,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have a new trailer for The Outer Worlds 2 starring Ben Schwartz.

310
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, look for that October 29th.

311
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:28,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Vampire of the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 is going to be coming out October 21st.

312
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:30,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a new trailer for that.

313
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Cult of the Lamb, Woolhaven.

314
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, I think, DLC.

315
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming out next year as well.

316
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:42,563
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks cute and culty, which I think is the point.

317
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:48,527
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft Midnight, the 11th expansion for World of Warcraft.

318
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:51,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really the 11th?

319
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy smokes.

320
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:57,953
[SPEAKER_01]: It is coming out next year and I don't know anything about it.

321
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:03,559
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the one that's going to bring player housing, which is a thing in Final Fantasy XIV.

322
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,085
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been other MMOs that have had this as well, but World of Warcraft's kind of doing its own thing with it.

323
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:15,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really sounds like they're trying to do some things differently to fix some of the bitches people have about Final Fantasy XIV's housing.

324
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,495
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you don't have to bid on lots.

325
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:22,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody can have a house if you do the quest for it and all that stuff.

326
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:51,666
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah that part sounds really neat and they have another system they're building into it is something called Prey the Prey system not like Holy Church but like the video game P-R-E-Y type of thing meaning the Predator and the Prey and that's actually exactly what it is is that while you're doing quests if you turn on this motor I think you have to talk to a quest keeper to do it you can actually be hunted by an NPC while you're doing quests that could come out at any time and try to get you

327
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It sort of makes me think of like trying to play on the old PvP realms.

328
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It really sounds like that a little bit.

329
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it sounds like there's some interesting new features.

330
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I think WoW has been really good actually.

331
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:04,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I want that?

332
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:09,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Rewards, Glory, Fame, that type of thing.

333
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,225
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not worth being jump-scared by the game.

334
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:12,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

335
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:15,188
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is optional, so if you don't want it, don't do it.

336
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:26,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say WoW for me has been on an upswing ever since that really shitty expansion that made Sylvanas the main baddie.

337
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a terrible expansion.

338
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember what it was called.

339
00:25:28,224 --> 00:25:28,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfector.

340
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:35,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's been a lot better since Dragonflight was pretty good and this most recent one, War Within, was pretty darn good as well.

341
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:43,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I can't say I will stay subbed forever to World of Warcraft, but I will buy the expansion and renew my sub.

342
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoy WoW enough to play through the main story.

343
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to go back to it if I've got a guild to play in.

344
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think I have a guild anymore.

345
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:54,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it time to rebuild Danger Squad?

346
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:55,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

347
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:56,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

348
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the Game Boy kids are full Final Fantasy XIV.

349
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:00,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they're in WoW at all.

350
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:05,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Spike and John might have tried one of these recent ones, but I could be wrong.

351
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong.

352
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:24,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm

353
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:46,315
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Spectrum Ghosts of Yotai

354
00:26:46,295 --> 00:27:16,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghosts of Yotai Legends we're showing that off that's coming out now October 2nd and we had Resident Evil Requiem a new trailer for that as well that of course is announced for February 27th next year and then the big one Black Myth Zonghui which is a brand new Black Myth game following Black Myth Wukong looks fantastic another game of the year contender probably

355
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:16,874
[SPEAKER_01]: probably.

356
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

357
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:18,242
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

358
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:25,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so lots of, I think what was interesting about that, it was a lot of kind of, I don't know, for me it was a lot of games I wasn't expecting to hear about.

359
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's cool, but I feel like outside of what you just talked about, the news this week was very light.

360
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:46,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we made a lot of space for Gamescom and I feel like the news we got, I don't know, hasn't exactly been, you know, it filled a couple of days of buzz, but because they didn't do a lot of shadow drops, right?

361
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:48,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that He-Man game shadow dropped?

362
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:56,053
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, I don't remember, but that was also one that was shown off in the pre-show as well.

363
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,677
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the He-Man game, and that looked pretty awesome.

364
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:00,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminded me a lot of, like, Golden Axe.

365
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:06,287
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, go pre-order, or not pre-order, go wishlist Densha Attack.

366
00:28:07,168 --> 00:28:08,250
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

367
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted the trailer in Discord.

368
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:11,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.

369
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:28,324
[SPEAKER_05]: well the other thing about that He-Man game that kind of caught my eye is that He-Man has never really had a good video game I'm sorry like and like quick name a He-Man video game there haven't there's been don't think there has been no there's no there has there's been like seven of them one was on the Game Boy Advance Bobby

370
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:30,367
[SPEAKER_03]: brought up a Commodore 64 one.

371
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:32,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there were like three of them on the Commodore 64.

372
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:36,756
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a text adventure game, I believe, at one point.

373
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:41,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reality is, and I'm sure somebody in chat is going to say, you're wrong, and that's fine.

374
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:46,971
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them were particularly memorable, or we wouldn't be sitting here going, wow,

375
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:51,420
[SPEAKER_05]: A He-Man side-scroller, like, Ninja Turtles fighting game-looking thing?

376
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe nobody did this before.

377
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we wouldn't be saying that if we had, you know, other He-Man games that were extremely memorable.

378
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,056
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm excited for that.

379
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:04,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need to take all these properties that are cool, like, you know, the Power Rangers, Ninja Turtles, He-Man...

380
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:06,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash them all together.

381
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:07,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's smash them all together.

382
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: All those games have had all those franchises have had relatively successful games recently.

383
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,470
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like 80s, 80s, 90s, you know, Saturday mornings, Saturday morning Smackdown.

384
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Easy.

385
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:22,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

386
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:22,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

387
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:23,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

388
00:29:24,015 --> 00:29:25,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure a lot of people would play the hell out of that game.

389
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:26,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some G.I.

390
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:27,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe in there.

391
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,428
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll throw in She-Ra, you know, like all sorts of and screech from Saved by the Bell just because.

392
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:33,708
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

393
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:33,968
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

394
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:35,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that guy.

395
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's right.

396
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy kind of turned out.

397
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:38,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Canceled.

398
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:41,675
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy kind of turned out a little crazy McGee, didn't he?

399
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, then how about Slater?

400
00:29:43,096 --> 00:29:43,697
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Slater?

401
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:44,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Slater from Saved by the Bell.

402
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:46,880
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because he's also bad.

403
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he?

404
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,481
[SPEAKER_05]: What did he do?

405
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:48,981
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Urkel?

406
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Urkel wasn't Saturday morning, was he?

407
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, he's TGIF or like Tuesday or something.

408
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:57,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, Urkel had a cartoon.

409
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:58,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't he?

410
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,130
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

411
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel had a cartoon.

412
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:02,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean then that we have to have Ed Grimley?

413
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:29,065
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

414
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:45,855

[SPEAKER_05]: You could all be sitting on mountains of cash if you would just license your 40-year-old properties.

425
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:25,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically Mugen at that point.

426
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and you know, though... Mugen's not real.

427
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have...

428
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,126
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have to do the other Saturday Morning Classic.

429
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:42,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Every whatever of this has to end in a Soul Train line.

430
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:43,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Like during the credits.

431
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,860
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the credits.

432
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:45,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

433
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:50,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was the other Saturday thing was watching Soul Train.

434
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I watched Soul Train.

435
00:31:53,521 --> 00:32:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Martello4 in chat says fucking Rob bringing back Eureka's Castle memory unlocked oh you want let's go to the deep let's go to the deep cuts y'all want turkey television come on let's let's bring that on there too uh oh oh Deft Deft just won the chat for tonight Sabato Higante I never heard of that until just now oh my god Sabato Higante was like

436
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:23,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was on... Yeah, I grew up in Alabama.

437
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:28,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you didn't... Did they not get the Spanish channel in Alabama?

438
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:34,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess... Well, if they did, no one in my family ever watched it because I come from a bunch of redneck assholes.

439
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's just, we... You just needed bigger rabbit ears on your TV.

440
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:41,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't as big of a thing.

441
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:43,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as big of a thing.

442
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we...

443
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:48,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the South.

444
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,461
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff.

445
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:52,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I never even knew what a quinceaÃ±era was until I moved out here.

446
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Martello4 in chat says, anything before Hey Dude is purely historical for me.

447
00:32:56,752 --> 00:33:00,578
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's kind of that early 90s Nickelodeon is kind of where I draw the line.

448
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:03,622
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would accept the characters from Hey Dude.

449
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept Marsha Brady when she was on Hey Dude.

450
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept her as a playable character.

451
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept the little redhead punk guy from Salute Your Shorts could be a character.

452
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I would accept

453
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:33,306
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

454
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:34,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Moe!

455
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:35,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Moe!

456
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:35,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Moe!

457
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:36,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Moe!

458
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:38,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing the aggro Craig.

459
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to be the aggro Craig, okay?

460
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, why isn't this a thing?

461
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:47,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you guys are just going off and now Fifth Dream is bringing Vicky the Robot into this.

462
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all.

463
00:33:48,655 --> 00:33:53,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you went on a rabbit hole reading about behind-the-scenes stuff for Small Wonder, okay?

464
00:33:56,135 --> 00:34:23,070
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

465
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:45,109
[SPEAKER_05]: and so this was a big what they call an anomaly event where the two teams because this is a Ingers is very player versus player that's the other thing that some people like about it some people don't like about it but I've always enjoyed it it gets it motivates me to go to places even within my own town that I wouldn't usually go to so and Rin Mari in chat says ENL gang rise up we

466
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:57,462
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

467
00:34:57,897 --> 00:35:26,115
[SPEAKER_05]: were like honestly I wasn't doing much because there wasn't much to do but I really felt like this time like there was you know a lot of activity going on uh me and one of my best friends who plays the game Johnny we were running from portal to portal to to try to do a link to what's called like a shard we were doing all this stuff um so yeah we were having a lot of fun yeah it was nerdy it was nerdy but it was I got like 20,000 steps that Saturday so but

468
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:29,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot like we drove up there.

469
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:34,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So me and two of my buddies that I know from the game, we drove up on Friday and drove back on Sunday.

470
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is about a 10 hour drive.

471
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It's maybe eight and a half actually on the highway.

472
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:41,524
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, factoring gas, coffee.

473
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:42,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a long day.

474
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:46,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God my friends went because that would have been a really long drive by myself.

475
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:50,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So I probably would have flown if I was by myself, to be honest.

476
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:52,098
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was it was a good time.

477
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:54,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of fun.

478
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Next weekend, however, is Labor Day weekend.

479
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:01,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I've been doing for the last decade, I'm going to DragonCon.

480
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will be at DragonCon and I am really, really excited about the show this year.

481
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:11,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can finally tell you because the app was released while we were out.

482
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:15,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you some of these pretty cool panels I'm going to be a part of.

483
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:19,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to quickly run down my schedule for those that may be going to DragonCon.

484
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:28,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see a picture version of this over on my BlueSky, which is robroberts.bsky.social, or my Instagram, which is MrMRRobRoberts.

485
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see them, MrRobRoberts.

486
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say if you want to meet and say hello, the best time to say hello to myself and Bobby Blackwolf, who's also going from the Voice Geeks Network, because this is his backyard, but it's still like a vacation for him.

487
00:36:41,510 --> 00:37:05,087
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

488
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:21,186
[SPEAKER_05]: HiltonGallerySX

489
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:29,938
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for people to meet each other and mingle and just get to know each other from the digital media track because there's a lot of people that talk on the Discord.

490
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's always like, when are we meeting up at con?

491
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,641
[SPEAKER_05]: When are we meeting up in con?

492
00:37:32,942 --> 00:37:37,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year, Bobby and I were like, we should have a meetup at con that's like official.

493
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:40,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did a thing, but not a lot of people showed up.

494
00:37:40,312 --> 00:37:46,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And I honestly, in retrospection, think it should not have been called the VOG Network Presents meeting.

495
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixer, or whatever we called it last year.

496
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:50,565
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, we kept our name out of it.

497
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's in the description.

498
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:57,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it says Voice Geeks Network in the description, but this is simply called Content Creator Networking and Mixer.

499
00:37:57,052 --> 00:38:10,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to know where do I meet other people that do other... For me, the most interesting thing about it is I meet people that main YouTube or TikTok, which are venues I'm less familiar with than Twitch or podcasting.

500
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, that'll be for about an hour.

501
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Come by and say hello to myself and Bobby.

502
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That is really...

503
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

504
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,172
[SPEAKER_05]: On Friday, I will plug this.

505
00:38:43,192 --> 00:38:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of Bobby's events, but I'm going to really try to go too because I actually don't have any digital media panels except for the one on Thursday.

506
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:57,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But Bobby's going to be doing one at 2.30 called the Podcast Track 20th Anniversary Panel because digital media started as the podcast tracks.

507
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:59,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the digital media podcast track.

508
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:01,909
[SPEAKER_05]: And this track has meant a lot to me over the years too.

509
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to go and make a cameo.

510
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though Bobby's on the panel, I'm not.

511
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be in the room and heckle.

512
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:08,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my plan.

513
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:10,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Friday at 2.30 also in Galleria 6.

514
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the first big panel, I'm fortunate that as of last year I'm working with the main programming track at DragonCon and I feel myself, I consider myself very lucky and fortunate to be there.

515
00:39:21,197 --> 00:39:31,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy that they will have me because now I get to do some big panels such as this one that's going to be Friday at 4pm in the Atrium.

516
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: That is...

517
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:53,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Once Upon a Time Once Upon a Time

518
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:54,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was called Once.

519
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Once, dot, dot, dot, and sometimes you would see it stylized upon a time, but Once was the name.

520
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:07,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have six people that were on that show, including Regina.

521
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited about that.

522
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:10,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And Hook.

523
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Hook is on the panel.

524
00:40:13,075 --> 00:40:13,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

525
00:40:13,796 --> 00:40:14,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

526
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

527
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:16,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got a lot of really cool people.

528
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:17,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited about that.

529
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's on Friday at 4 o'clock.

530
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday is a pretty big day for me.

531
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:25,507
[SPEAKER_05]: This is wild.

532
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe this is happening.

533
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:32,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So Saturday, and Ranma, yes, I am cosplaying, and I'll come back to that question in a minute.

534
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:38,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is all because of my friend Victoria, Arya Snark, who is going to her first DragonCon.

535
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:43,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We are doing a couples cosplay on Saturday night, and I'll explain that in a minute.

536
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So Saturday at 11.30 a.m., I am doing a panel also in the atrium with the cast from the Fox television show Bones.

537
00:40:52,407 --> 00:40:52,607
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

538
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:53,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

539
00:40:53,328 --> 00:41:16,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

540
00:41:16,606 --> 00:41:34,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

541
00:41:34,915 --> 00:41:40,932
[SPEAKER_05]: In the West and Peachtree, Saturday at 2.30, Baldur's Gate 3.

542
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:45,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, we have the other half of the cast of Baldur's Gate 3.

543
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:49,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So sadly, nobody last year is coming back.

544
00:41:49,917 --> 00:42:06,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Carameldansen

545
00:42:06,455 --> 00:42:09,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Downey, who played Gale, will be there.

546
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Emma Gregory, who played Minthara, will be on that panel.

547
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:16,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Sissy Jones, the Absolute, will be on that panel as well.

548
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Jones, who played Halson, will be there as well.

549
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:25,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just announced, it was only going to be those five, and this is how things change.

550
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:31,011
[SPEAKER_05]: They were able to secure last week, Amelia Tyler, the narrator, is going to be there as well.

551
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

552
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:32,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

553
00:42:32,735 --> 00:42:33,897
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a treasure.

554
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they all are great.

555
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:39,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Every fucking person in that game gives an award-winning performance.

556
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:43,136
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we are still talking about this game this far after the launch.

557
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:51,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, obviously, Amelia in her role frames the whole stinking thing and is your biggest introduction to that.

558
00:42:51,153 --> 00:42:52,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her outtakes, too.

559
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:55,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, I'm just like, I'm hyped for that panel.

560
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:56,526
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a Q&A panel.

561
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:58,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, please come ask questions.

562
00:42:59,033 --> 00:42:59,614
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have a good time.

563
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:01,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

564
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have... Ask her if she'll narrate my life.

565
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:07,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited about this.

566
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gaming related.

567
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I have gaming related stuff too.

568
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:11,501
[SPEAKER_05]: This is super gaming related.

569
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:18,550
[SPEAKER_05]: In the Westin and the Augusta E-H rooms on Saturday at 4 o'clock, I'll be doing a panel called The Way of the Loremaster.

570
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just myself and Sean Copeland, who is with Blizzard.

571
00:43:22,576 --> 00:43:23,958
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the Blizzard Loremaster.

572
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the keeper of the lore at Blizzard.

573
00:43:26,461 --> 00:43:29,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny because I attended this panel as a fan.

574
00:43:29,665 --> 00:43:37,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I went just because that was the year Diablo 4 launched, and I just wanted to hear all about the Diablo lore and what went into it.

575
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:48,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been on this panel on the other side in the audience, and so I'm very honored to be sitting and being the one to moderate the questions for Sean about the Blizzard lore.

576
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very excited about that panel and that opportunity.

577
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:54,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is Saturday at 4 o'clock.

578
00:43:54,421 --> 00:44:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to plug a panel that's not mine, but I really want to try to drive attendance because this is also a gaming-related panel.

579
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So also on Saturday at 7 o'clock at night in the Westin E3H room, Bobby is going to be hosting the first-ever Speedrun Showcase at...

580
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:15,736
[SPEAKER_05]: DragonCon.

581
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,501
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be speedrunning with... Actually, Bobby's not speedrunning.

582
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,204
[SPEAKER_05]: A very popular Twitch name.

583
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy's great.

584
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:22,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I love him.

585
00:44:22,948 --> 00:44:26,054
[SPEAKER_05]: He gives off game show host energy, which I love.

586
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:32,224
[SPEAKER_05]: An Eternal Enigma is going to be the one that's actually speedrunning Silent Hill 4 The Room.

587
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:39,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I shout that out is that I want butts in the seats at this because this is...

588
00:44:39,697 --> 00:45:00,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

589
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:23,727
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S

590
00:45:23,707 --> 00:45:52,178
[SPEAKER_05]: which she has a from the stage version of Wicked she has an amazing Elphaba outfit that she's wearing I think Sunday but Saturday she's put together an all new costume and she is going to be dressed as Fiona from the 1999 2000 that era classic Josie and the Pussycats that was the character Parker Posey played so she said Rob it would be very easy for you to dress as Wyatt and I said Alan Cumming

591
00:45:52,158 --> 00:45:53,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in.

592
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to dress as Wyatt.

593
00:45:55,024 --> 00:46:04,523
[SPEAKER_05]: But her outfit, like she literally, so it's from the end of the movie where she's in that dress and it has 400 like vinyl mega records, decals on it.

594
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:05,726
[SPEAKER_05]: She made that fucking dress.

595
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:06,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.

596
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,571
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been detailing it on her Instagram.

597
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:08,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not surprised.

598
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:17,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm going to go as Wyatt to compliment her Fiona, but that is going to be Saturday night.

599
00:46:18,137 --> 00:46:22,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to wear that during my panels because that would be a little weird.

600
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want

601
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:30,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna say it's unprofessional because I know other moderators do cosplay, but I just feel like it takes it out of the zone a little bit for me.

602
00:46:30,508 --> 00:46:33,955
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, in my right headspace, so I'm gonna do that at night.

603
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:40,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might catch me at that speedrun showcase for a little bit dressed as that, but that's, yeah, that's the cosplay I am bringing.

604
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:42,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

605
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:42,955
Okay.

606
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:46,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost done, sorry, but I have two other panels to talk about.

607
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: That is Sunday.

608
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:52,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to be, and I just clicked off of it on the app.

609
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:52,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

610
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:56,331
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can find me in the app under speakers, Rob Roberts.

611
00:46:57,111 --> 00:47:02,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I know nobody is going to the con just to see me, but if you're curious where I'm at, that's a good way to figure it out.

612
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

613
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday at 10 a.m.,

614
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:14,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is over in the Hilton Grand West.

615
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is where I did a Lower Decks panel last year.

616
00:47:16,673 --> 00:47:23,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the Hilton Grand West, we have the Shaolin Brotherhood, The Journey of Liu Kang and Kung Lao.

617
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a Mortal Kombat movie panel.

618
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the recent reboot from 2020.

619
00:47:29,386 --> 00:47:34,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sequel, what they can say about it, I'm sure will come up.

620
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,073
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have Ludi Lin who played...

621
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:58,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke Kang, and Max Wang who played Kung Lao so very excited about that they will be on that panel with me talking about the Mortal Kombat films and we will do Q&A at that one and then again another pinch me moment I can't believe I'm being asked to do this but once again in the atrium on Sunday at 1130 a.m.

622
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:04,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars panel I've been asked back to do the Star Wars hodgepodge panel and

623
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this.

624
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:09,947
[SPEAKER_05]: This is quite the hodgepodge of celebrities from the Star Wars universe.

625
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so honored that I will get to sit down with John Boyega, who plays Finn, of course, the Stormtrooper in the movie trilogy.

626
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:24,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Also on that panel, Diana Lee Inosanto, who plays Morgan Elsbeth in The Mandalorian.

627
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:25,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

628
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:27,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon...

629
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:32,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Cassian Etis, who plays Axe Woves, I think in like four episodes of The Mandalorian.

630
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:36,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit more of a minor part, but had an important arc in The Mandalorian.

631
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:40,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Emily Swallow, who also was in The Mandalorian as the Armorer.

632
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:43,944
[SPEAKER_03]: She is amazing for the record.

633
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:45,788
[SPEAKER_03]: She was also in Supernatural.

634
00:48:45,768 --> 00:49:04,553
[SPEAKER_05]: as Lilith.

635
00:49:04,533 --> 00:49:09,599
[SPEAKER_05]: but he is a prolific voice actor and it's gaming related.

636
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,807
[SPEAKER_05]: He played Starkiller in Star Wars The Force Unleashed and Force Unleashed 2 and the Soul Calibur cameo for Starkiller.

637
00:49:16,168 --> 00:49:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Sam Witwer.

638
00:49:17,609 --> 00:49:22,476
[SPEAKER_05]: He also played Darth Maul in a lot of the animated projects and Emperor Palpatine in a few of them as well.

639
00:49:22,536 --> 00:49:29,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's a very prolific Star Wars type of person in a lot of that.

640
00:49:29,024 --> 00:49:30,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's...

641
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:37,757
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a very... This is that kind of infamous DragonCon hodgepodge of people that are related to the same thing.

642
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:52,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very curious to hear how the Q&A is going to go at that panel when you've got John Boyega, you've got some very talented folks that were on The Mandalorian, and you have animated and video game universe kind of people all

643
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:54,524
[SPEAKER_05]: All on the same panel.

644
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited to see how that goes.

645
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

646
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:59,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year's Star Wars panel was a very similar sort of thing.

647
00:49:59,953 --> 00:50:02,137
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all on different shows.

648
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a blast.

649
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like to think the audience did too.

650
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:06,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we'll have a blast again this year.

651
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:08,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

652
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:09,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Very busy.

653
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Very excited for this year's DragonCon.

654
00:50:11,632 --> 00:50:13,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of can't believe it's Wednesday.

655
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:15,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

656
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:17,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

657
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm leaving on Wednesday, so I have to pinch myself.

658
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:22,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But I bought some last-minute outfits.

659
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:22,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

660
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:26,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some new loud-ass shirts and loud pants to wear on some of these panels.

661
00:50:26,496 --> 00:50:28,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very, very looking forward.

662
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to rock the bald.

663
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ditching the hats this year.

664
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:37,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I may take one or two cabi hats, but overall, I'm going to rock the bald this year, which is new for me, too, on television.

665
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very excited for all of that.

666
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:40,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

667
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:47,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

668
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

669
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:49,292
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

670
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:50,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It was alright.

671
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:54,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Dead by Daylight, of course.

672
00:50:56,118 --> 00:51:01,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played Palia, I've played Mass Effect, and then whatever I'm playing on my phone.

673
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:02,624
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

674
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing big, just my usuals.

675
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:08,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then we'll go over to Loki.

676
00:51:09,762 --> 00:51:16,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been fighting PC stuff this week, but mostly I've been...

677
00:51:16,225 --> 00:51:23,475
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing up the Slumber Dome, which was my massive project that I was working on on our Channel 64 SMP.

678
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:29,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a massive battle arena with a custom data pack that I coded.

679
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:39,356
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically a PvE arena with 20 different randomized waves of mobs you get to fight, and I mean, it goes on forever.

680
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:43,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You get gear, you get power-ups, items, all sorts of stuff.

681
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:44,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a full...

682
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:51,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Fledged game with custom music, audio, visuals, all the flair.

683
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:53,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Fireworks, there's fireworks in there.

684
00:51:55,696 --> 00:52:00,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Should have my new episode out about it tonight, hopefully.

685
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I've been fighting, like, there were some weird random crash issues I had with my PC that I think I've sorted out, but I'm not really sure.

686
00:52:10,374 --> 00:52:13,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And it caused a lot of weird stuff to happen, like

687
00:52:13,972 --> 00:52:18,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Streamlabs OBS, which I've been trying to get away from for a while now.

688
00:52:19,298 --> 00:52:21,580
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically wiped all the settings in it.

689
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:22,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, it didn't wipe all the settings.

690
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:29,810
[SPEAKER_01]: It got to a point where it was incredibly choppy in Streamlabs OBS.

691
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was recording playback.

692
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:37,258
[SPEAKER_01]: My view is like 100% fine, 120 FPS or whatever.

693
00:52:38,059 --> 00:52:40,782
[SPEAKER_01]: In the capture, it's like 2 FPS.

694
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:43,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, that's not right.

695
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:51,786
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I dumped that finally, which I should have done a while ago, but I'm now in vanilla OBS, and everything's working fine.

696
00:52:52,628 --> 00:53:00,769
[SPEAKER_01]: After I got past some learning curve stuff with the extra inputs and stuff that it has in there, it has like a default, like...

697
00:53:00,749 --> 00:53:26,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Audio and a default mic capture in there that's always set and so I had to like figure out that that was in there and take it out so that I have better control because I don't like to record my mic audio in OBS when I record I record separate so in case if I flub something or I want to rearrange where my audio is plus I'm able to put more filters on top of it that kind of

698
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:54,263
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Bellatro, I was playing a little bit of Bellatro

699
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:56,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played a little of that too.

700
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:57,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

701
00:53:57,916 --> 00:54:00,180
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it, I think.

702
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:00,881
Cool.

703
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:02,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see my gaming week.

704
00:54:02,904 --> 00:54:05,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously there was the Ingress stuff going on, so that counts.

705
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, you know I'm still playing Final Fantasy XI on the Horizon server.

706
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I even did a stream and had some people that are also playing on Horizon dip in, and that was really cool.

707
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:16,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Very supportive community.

708
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:20,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of talking about this where I was like, I think a good chunk of the people that are playing Horizon...

709
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: are people that were playing Final Fantasy XI in their teens and 20s.

710
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:26,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now it's like a late 30s and 40s crowd.

711
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:28,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's just... I'm just going to keep it real.

712
00:54:28,322 --> 00:54:33,650
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a certain level of maturity that comes with that, I think, that you don't have as many edgelords as maybe play other MMOs.

713
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to say those don't exist.

714
00:54:35,453 --> 00:54:37,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a couple questionable...

715
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,036
[SPEAKER_05]: type of people.

716
00:54:38,056 --> 00:54:43,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, I've really enjoyed the community with Horizon and dipping back into Final Fantasy XI.

717
00:54:44,144 --> 00:54:48,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my Red Mage to level 30, which means I get to unlock the advanced jobs next.

718
00:54:48,249 --> 00:54:49,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be my next big thing.

719
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:56,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And the wild thing is, so like Loki, you remember the Final Fantasy XI days, and DarkSakura, you too, to an extent.

720
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:02,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a couple of Dunes parties, but otherwise, these parties have been in places like

721
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah Magoo, Champagne, Palboro, or excuse me, Rollenberry Fields was one of them, Maze of Chakrami.

722
00:55:10,657 --> 00:55:22,191
[SPEAKER_05]: There's zones that you don't usually go to, but the way Horizon sort of, I think they rebalanced some of the monster distribution and made some other XP camps so everybody wasn't always in the same fucking place.

723
00:55:22,211 --> 00:55:29,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So I never did an XP party in Quiffham Island, which in the old vanilla days was like your level 20 to 30 zone.

724
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I never did a party there, and I'm level 30, which is wild.

725
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it's kind of neat.

726
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:35,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, I'm, I'm, again, I'm just loving the experience there.

727
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was been sinking a lot of hours than I care to admit on 11, but it's a lot of core memories unlocked for me.

728
00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:43,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, I've been relatively enjoying the experience.

729
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:44,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I did promise.

730
00:55:44,519 --> 00:55:46,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting stuck on Quiff of Mailand.

731
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you get stuck back in the jungle there.

732
00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:50,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just like, you're thinking of Kazam.

733
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're right, you're right.

734
00:55:54,877 --> 00:56:03,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still collecting my Kazam keys, which now I can solo because there's less pressure to go there until you're more in your 30s and 40s.

735
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:06,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Juno?

736
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:07,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right, that's right.

737
00:56:07,707 --> 00:56:11,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's with the giant green ogre things are out there.

738
00:56:11,073 --> 00:56:12,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's that it looks very dark.

739
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:13,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Quiff of Myland.

740
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:16,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember the leeches and the worms, I think.

741
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the thing.

742
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:20,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Like playing this has been a lot of like, oh, core memory unlocked.

743
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:25,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and now I've been learning thanks to watching some other streamers and looking at some YouTubes.

744
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:31,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned how to unlock the frames per second so that you can play the game or I should say cap it at 60 frames.

745
00:56:31,028 --> 00:56:36,703
[SPEAKER_05]: which is very smooth and looks great and some of the other graphical upgrades which is awesome.

746
00:56:36,944 --> 00:56:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I did say I would play other games as well too and I did.

747
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:46,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I checked out a free game that was on Epic Game Store which was called Hidden Folks and

748
00:56:46,148 --> 00:57:06,520
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

749
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like it as a chill type of game and as a very sort of like pick up, easy play.

750
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:16,921
[SPEAKER_05]: You can save your spot, come back to it later, almost like a crossword puzzle or something.

751
00:57:16,941 --> 00:57:23,975
[SPEAKER_05]: The one questionable choice in this game is that all of the sound effects is like somebody beatboxing.

752
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Like somebody did a bloop, bloop, beep.

753
00:57:27,037 --> 00:57:30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time you click something, it makes some funky noise.

754
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:32,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a big fan of that.

755
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:36,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually try to disable sounds when I play the game.

756
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,829
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself, I am enjoying.

757
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the stylistic choice to do it.

758
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:41,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like it.

759
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:44,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my one feedback on that game.

760
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:48,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, especially knowing that it is a freebie, or at least I think was last week.

761
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:49,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it is anymore.

762
00:57:49,861 --> 00:57:51,863
[SPEAKER_05]: It was definitely worth checking out.

763
00:57:51,923 --> 00:57:54,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know they get paid by Epic, so that's great.

764
00:57:54,526 --> 00:58:24,043
[SPEAKER_05]: so I checked out that game and then I've been playing some retro games too just going through some NES classics but something's fucky with my NES emulator right now because I'll play the game for five minutes and it'll be great and then all of a sudden five minutes in I'll start getting frame skip like bad like on a game like fucking Donkey Kong that should not be getting the bad like lag and stuff and slow down and it's not like NES you know hardware slow down or anything like that it's something to do with the emulator and retro arc I gotta figure out what the fuck's going on

765
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:26,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody, I've been trying to, you know, sleuth online.

766
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:31,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like it could be something like the games recording element or something could be screwed it up.

767
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:39,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got to go in and see if I can disable that because that would make a lot of sense as to it's fine for five minutes and then suddenly starts acting fucky would make sense.

768
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something like some sort of buffer in there.

769
00:58:41,528 --> 00:58:44,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to look into that and try to fix it.

770
00:58:44,432 --> 00:58:48,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had said, just delete your configuration file and let RetroArch make a new one.

771
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:48,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I might just do that.

772
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:49,900
[SPEAKER_05]: See if that fixes it.

773
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,542
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

774
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:51,762
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

775
00:58:51,782 --> 00:58:52,984
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was my gaming week.

776
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:57,149
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have some more news to get into, so I'm going to go over to Loki.

777
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Start us off.

778
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:03,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, let's talk a little bit about Black Ops 7, my favorite game!

779
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:21,198
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that was definitely noticeable in Black Ops 6 last year was some of the questionable choices that seem to be coming from AI generative art use in the game.

780
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:25,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most notable example of that would have been the six-figured zombie.

781
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, to be fair,

782
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:42,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Call of Duty does do some silly stuff with the zombies where the number of fingers is the version of the game so it could technically be that but

783
00:59:43,505 --> 01:00:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

784
01:00:02,371 --> 01:00:05,639
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in a world now where there's AI tools.

785
01:00:05,699 --> 01:00:14,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our official statement is, we said last year around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team 100%.

786
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:19,511
[SPEAKER_01]: We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes into the game.

787
01:00:20,252 --> 01:00:28,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are some things that look like they've gone straight into the game and it looks like no one's touched it.

788
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:31,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, it was probably by accident.

789
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:35,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was never the intention for it to be just dumped in the game like that.

790
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:41,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come out and been very clear that we use these tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members.

791
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:44,630
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have and what they're doing with the final touches and building the game.

792
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:53,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to wonder though, like, you know, when you're crunching your team like this that cut, you know, corners will be cut and that they might do that.

793
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:58,753
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and then of course, you know, they asked him straight up, hey, what about Santa Claus with six fingers there?

794
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:06,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, well, not my department, but I know the team that's actually looking at stuff and making sure that's not shipped.

795
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,068
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we fix it.

796
01:01:08,605 --> 01:01:08,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

797
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,075
[SPEAKER_01]: You take no responsibility for the stuff that's out there.

798
01:01:12,577 --> 01:01:16,509
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're like, oh, no, we touch everything and then you show them, well, no, actually you don't.

799
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:19,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, not my problem.

800
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:23,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

801
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,452
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't fill me with confidence.

802
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:27,717
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, expect more AI slop in the near future.

803
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:29,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee that.

804
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

805
01:01:30,741 --> 01:01:36,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And you all know I'm not a fan of the generative AI, especially as replacement art.

806
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:41,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we've seen a lot of companies that have used it for placeholder projects.

807
01:01:41,174 --> 01:02:08,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, everything is...

808
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:30,199
[SPEAKER_05]: about Magic the Gathering was recently put to the fire a little bit because they had sort of been caught using some AI and their response was to sort of deflect and blame Adobe's generative fill because what they were doing, I guess they were taking the 2D card, which obviously Magic has some stellar human art behind it, but it sounded like they were-

809
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Boris Vallejo for a while.

810
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:33,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Julie Bell.

811
01:02:33,222 --> 01:02:39,588
[SPEAKER_05]: They were taking the 2D card art and they had to, for certain things, expand it into 3D box space.

812
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:43,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They were using Adobe Generative Fill to do it and they got caught doing it.

813
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:46,154
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think generative in that means?

814
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:52,039
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not generated out of space by magic artists that live in the cosmos.

815
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,663
[SPEAKER_01]: It's AI that's doing it.

816
01:02:55,983 --> 01:02:57,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like

817
01:02:59,137 --> 01:03:02,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see more of these places where the tools are sort of unavoidable.

818
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:06,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby brings up a great point in this too in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

819
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf says all of these companies are forcing AI into all their products because nobody was using it when it was extra.

820
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:17,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just bundling it in and raising the base price.

821
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,570
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, yeah, that's a huge thing that's happened.

822
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft obviously did that pretty recently with Office.

823
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:28,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, now you have fucking Copilot in Notepad, which nobody asked for, right?

824
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:35,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, I definitely think, and while you can turn that off in Notepad, and I did, it's wild to me.

825
01:03:35,722 --> 01:04:03,670
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

826
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:10,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand a lot of people are gonna combat that with the computing power it uses and all of this stuff.

827
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:14,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say that train has already left the station.

828
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:19,631
[SPEAKER_05]: These companies are already incorporating AI into all of these different ways.

829
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we are left with where do we as consumers

830
01:04:24,558 --> 01:04:31,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Draw those lines of what are we willing to pay for that comes out of AI and what are we going to reject?

831
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:41,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you've already seen that in the gaming space that when generative AI is used to basically do the art assets in a game, people are not fucking interested in that.

832
01:04:41,046 --> 01:04:45,233
[SPEAKER_05]: They're about as interested in that as they were the NFT type of thing.

833
01:04:45,213 --> 01:05:01,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually read an article in Forbes not long ago that was talking about how it's only 5% of company AI initiatives actually show any success, that the majority of them are failing and losing money for companies.

834
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:10,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I think especially where people are thinking AI is going to replace people, I think a lot of companies are going to get what they pay for in that regard.

835
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:11,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And

836
01:05:12,314 --> 01:05:13,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that needs to happen.

837
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:13,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

838
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other comments in chat.

839
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:23,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Martello4 says, AI should be regulated heavily and they know it because of the reasons they are going to and are using it.

840
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:30,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and actually I think there's a pretty big lawsuit against MidJourney?

841
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those AI?

842
01:05:31,504 --> 01:05:37,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's coming from Hollywood because they basically went to MidJourney and said, paint me a picture of Shrek.

843
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:40,216
[SPEAKER_05]: and it made the copyright and trademark character Shrek.

844
01:05:40,677 --> 01:05:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Paint me a picture of Jasmine from Aladdin and it spat out.

845
01:05:45,282 --> 01:05:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's spitting out copyright and trademark things so Hollywood is bringing down its iron fist and all of its lawyers on AI.

846
01:05:52,170 --> 01:06:00,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that is the battle that needs to be fought and needs to be fought quickly because they are raising some good points.

847
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: in that particular circumstance with all the generative stuff.

848
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be interesting to see what comes of that.

849
01:06:06,147 --> 01:06:08,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree, AI needs to be regulated.

850
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:20,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we can't fucking get trademark and patent and all this other law updated, I could go on a whole other tangent about what the drag performer Lexi Love is going through right now.

851
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:36,878
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

852
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:42,566
[SPEAKER_05]: because she's sending cease and desist things to the venue when nobody gives a fuck who this other person is.

853
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:55,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a no-name performer in Hollywood that is using this to profit off of what a trans woman has done on television and the past she's drawn for herself.

854
01:06:55,404 --> 01:06:57,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really sick, to be quite honest.

855
01:06:57,708 --> 01:07:03,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the type of thing where it's like, trademark law is really fucked right now that she has the ability to do that.

856
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:06,460
[SPEAKER_05]: She, being the adult performer, has the ability to do that.

857
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.

858
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:15,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope the drag performer takes her ass to court because the trademark had lapsed and gets that fucking thing yanked away from her.

859
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet it reminds me a lot of how the, and then sues her ass for getting all those things canceled, reminds me of when somebody tried to, was it trademark or patent?

860
01:07:26,888 --> 01:07:28,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was patent podcasting.

861
01:07:28,951 --> 01:07:38,792
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

862
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that'll happen in that scenario.

863
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:54,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I know we're getting a long way from AI, but my point being is that when we can't regulate these other laws that were written decades ago, the technology is moving faster than the laws.

864
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem is all the lawmakers are consumed with dumb fucking shit right now.

865
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:14,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and even that there are people today using outdated laws to make other legislation, even to push more governmental control that needs to happen.

866
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:15,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

867
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:18,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what?

868
01:08:18,644 --> 01:08:37,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine.

869
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:38,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

870
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:39,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not done.

871
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:46,420
[SPEAKER_05]: What it regulates the companies to store because the companies basically have to store your proof of identification that you're an adult.

872
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And Blue Sky is like, we're not taking part in that.

873
01:08:48,502 --> 01:08:51,165
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to store that type of sensitive information on our end.

874
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:55,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because of that they're saying, we're just going to pull Blue Sky from Mississippi.

875
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:56,831
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the resources to enforce that.

876
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:57,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then good for them.

877
01:08:57,952 --> 01:08:58,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

878
01:08:58,693 --> 01:09:03,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the people care enough about it, they'll do something.

879
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:03,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

880
01:09:05,898 --> 01:09:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, yeah, and as Stuart Hunter-Matt says, too many stupid wars on a lot of fronts.

881
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:12,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's this whole, you know, bullshit over gerrymandering.

882
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:13,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're trying to distract us.

883
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:16,593
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all trying to distract us from the important things going on.

884
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:35,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We could pass a constitutional amendment, and I bet most people, most rational people, when not sitting next to a television, most rational people would agree with all 50 states ought to have independent districting commissions that draw the maps.

885
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:37,963
[SPEAKER_05]: All 50 states ought to have that.

886
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:40,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could be a thing that they could put in the Constitution.

887
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:44,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it would end all of this other garbage, no matter what side of the fence you're on.

888
01:09:45,113 --> 01:09:52,082
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're Texas, Newsom, no matter where you sit, that could end relatively quickly with a constitutional amendment.

889
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:53,604
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll never do it.

890
01:09:53,664 --> 01:09:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: No politician would agree to that.

891
01:09:55,927 --> 01:09:59,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, everything is too fucking...

892
01:09:59,864 --> 01:10:02,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Black and White now, and two extreme, to one end.

893
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:04,710
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no more middle ground.

894
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:05,231
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

895
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I have also said on repeat that I think that the U.S.

896
01:10:09,316 --> 01:10:13,321
[SPEAKER_03]: is too big for proper governance.

897
01:10:14,903 --> 01:10:16,425
[SPEAKER_03]: By size and by population.

898
01:10:19,269 --> 01:10:23,094
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, it's not on our show roll tonight, but the prices of the PlayStation 5 went up.

899
01:10:23,114 --> 01:10:24,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone want to guess why?

900
01:10:26,378 --> 01:10:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of a dumpster?

901
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:27,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're terrific?

902
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:30,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you all know the answer.

903
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,662
[SPEAKER_05]: They're terrific.

904
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,008
[SPEAKER_05]: They're terrific.

905
01:10:34,952 --> 01:10:36,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the world we live in, folks.

906
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:44,810
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, there are things to bring us joy and merriment in times of strife, and that would be Kirby Air Riders.

907
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:45,511
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Kirby.

908
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:46,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Kirby always makes me happy.

909
01:10:46,652 --> 01:10:47,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirby always makes me happy.

910
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:52,659
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're putting Kirby on ketchup bottles now, because Kirby makes people happy.

911
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:55,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's an all-new Kirby game, as you know, that's coming out.

912
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:56,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Kirby Air Riders.

913
01:10:56,844 --> 01:11:03,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, this was the game that was originally on the GameCube, but they are doing an all-new version for the Nintendo Switch 2, and it's coming out November 20th.

914
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:08,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a whole direct that they did that is showing off the game.

915
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:09,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for it.

916
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:18,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I do question Nintendo putting out two racing games as flagship titles in the same year and this early on.

917
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure that's the right strategy, but I also realize they're very different types of racing games.

918
01:11:25,297 --> 01:11:27,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I know y'all are typing right now to correct me.

919
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I realize they are very different experiences at the end of the day, but it's just...

920
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:32,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little interesting, that's all.

921
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:36,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But either way, I'll still buy it.

922
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:36,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll still play it.

923
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks really good.

924
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:41,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I just recently played the GameCube one for the first time, and I enjoyed myself.

925
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll check out the sequel for sure.

926
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:50,170
[SPEAKER_05]: In the direct, they were spotlighting things such as writing techniques and the different forms and traits of the writing machine.

927
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,213
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the boost charge.

928
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:57,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you hit the B button, your little machine hits the ground, and you can do a boost charge with that for a boost dash.

929
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:00,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Specials they were doing.

930
01:12:00,422 --> 01:12:03,285
[SPEAKER_05]: The Y button does a unique special move for the character.

931
01:12:03,305 --> 01:12:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So now there's more than one button to push, for sure.

932
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:11,692
[SPEAKER_05]: The Air Riders also unleash strategy into your choice of rider.

933
01:12:12,112 --> 01:12:16,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So every rider in the game has different traits that will impact the machine's performance.

934
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:19,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Weight, durability, specials, what you do at close range, and all of that.

935
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:23,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of faces from Kirby.

936
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:27,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Meta Knight, DDD, Bandana Waddle Dee...

937
01:12:27,368 --> 01:12:29,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Capy, Starman, so on and so on.

938
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:32,714
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of characters in the Kirby world that are showing up and that'll be a lot of fun.

939
01:12:33,355 --> 01:12:38,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also inhale or copy an enemy's abilities because of course it's Kirby.

940
01:12:38,861 --> 01:12:39,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't you be able to do that?

941
01:12:39,782 --> 01:12:40,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's Kirby.

942
01:12:40,183 --> 01:12:40,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

943
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:43,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, the game looks really fun.

944
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:51,156
[SPEAKER_05]: People will be able to get their hands on over at the other convention happening this weekend in Seattle if for whatever reason you made your choice to go there.

945
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:56,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess if you are a resident of the Pacific Northwest maybe it makes more sense to go to that convention.

946
01:12:56,562 --> 01:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

947
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us see.

948
01:13:28,123 --> 01:13:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Roblox.

949
01:13:30,527 --> 01:13:39,363
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times have we talked about all the various different user-made games on Roblox that they're making money off of?

950
01:13:39,744 --> 01:13:41,487
[SPEAKER_05]: That are rip-offs of other things.

951
01:13:41,939 --> 01:13:42,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not just that, yeah.

952
01:13:43,683 --> 01:13:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, Roblox published a post recently where they were talking about some changes, including restricting unrated experiences, which is what they call those games.

953
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:04,407
[SPEAKER_03]: and to those developers or those who are actively working on them.

954
01:14:04,427 --> 01:14:13,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be rolling out in the coming months with changing things from allowing users 13 or older to access unrated games.

955
01:14:13,138 --> 01:14:19,827
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming after a series of lawsuits that are claiming Roblox isn't providing a safe environment for underage users.

956
01:14:20,785 --> 01:14:32,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So for any inappropriate behavior, social hangout experiences that show private spaces like bedrooms or bathrooms will be limited to ID verified users at 17 or older.

957
01:14:34,392 --> 01:14:38,220
[SPEAKER_03]: They will restrict these hangout games that take place

958
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:48,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous ones that take place in those sorts of adult-only places are places like bars and clubs, who are at least 17, and have been ID verified.

959
01:14:48,812 --> 01:15:05,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will roll out a tool that automatically detects what they're calling violative scenes, or basically anything that goes against the rules, and that if a server hits enough violations, it automatically gets taken down

960
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have to work with the Roblox team to get it adjusted to get it back online.

961
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:18,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these lawsuits, there's one by Louisiana's Attorney General.

962
01:15:20,787 --> 01:15:22,609
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of them.

963
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:27,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to just read what the company's statement is.

964
01:15:27,474 --> 01:15:34,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue.

965
01:15:34,462 --> 01:15:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection including efforts to take users to other platforms where safety standards and moderation practices may differ.

966
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:47,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So they done fucked up and now they're trying to fix it.

967
01:15:48,805 --> 01:16:06,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Internet2CatchAPredator.com

968
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:35,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the predators that you're pointing out too.

969
01:16:35,870 --> 01:17:00,578
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

970
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:02,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do let them know.

971
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:07,412
[SPEAKER_01]: But now he's working with Chris Hansen to make a documentary on the whole thing.

972
01:17:08,388 --> 01:17:15,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you this, Loki, because I don't know Roblox that well besides what I see on TikTok and social media and stuff.

973
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:17,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just looks like â€“ I don't know.

974
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like this weird shithole of the internet, but I don't know.

975
01:17:20,765 --> 01:17:25,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You've said your kids have played that before and stuff.

976
01:17:26,252 --> 01:17:27,814
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your take on all of this?

977
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:33,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a big part of the platform based on your experience watching your kids play Roblox?

978
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:34,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like â€“

979
01:17:34,223 --> 01:17:40,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I mean, I think with the platform, you can kind of look at it like Steam almost.

980
01:17:40,598 --> 01:17:50,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even like just a lot of the other marketplaces where you have some content that's quality, some content that's not great, but it's like, it's still...

981
01:17:50,963 --> 01:18:15,469
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

982
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:21,736
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, instead of addressing those things that people have been complaining about saying like, yeah, there's inappropriate stuff on here.

983
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:26,842
[SPEAKER_01]: They only react to it when there's a big stink made about it.

984
01:18:26,862 --> 01:18:41,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for example, one of the things that Schlepp brought up in his videos were the only time that they would ever take one of these people that have been arrested, you know, off of their platform was when he made a big video about it that got millions of views.

985
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:47,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, this whole reaction to his videos, that's the only reason that they're acting now.

986
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:48,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even keep changing stuff.

987
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, wait a second, this is adult-only content.

988
01:18:51,409 --> 01:18:55,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you making the age to see it 17?

989
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:57,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it not 18?

990
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:59,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's weird.

991
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:01,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you doing this?

992
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:12,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you exerting more effort to protect the pedophiles or potential predators on your platform versus addressing the issues that people keep bringing up to you?

993
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:24,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, why do you have a game on your platform or even allow a game on your platform, whether it's marked 17 plus or not, that allows you to just hang out in bathrooms with other people and like chit chat about stuff?

994
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:25,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

995
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:26,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that a thing?

996
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:28,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say no, you can't make those types of games.

997
01:19:29,018 --> 01:19:29,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.

998
01:19:30,226 --> 01:19:31,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So easy.

999
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:56,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Curating your platform maybe I don't know if it's you know one of those things where like they can't curate the platform because then they lose their like title 2 protections or something like that you know like YouTube or something like that um I don't know I don't know what the rules are but like as far as it seems like and it seems to be the agreement from a lot of content creators because even a lot of their partner like streamers and content creators have like said buh-bye we're not dealing with you anymore after all this and

1000
01:19:56,834 --> 01:20:24,546
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not doing enough and so I think that this reaction that they're taking right now is not enough and they're losing stock value from it and everything interesting thanks for the take on it because Roblox is really like a foreign world to me I think I downloaded the client on Xbox once and maybe I tried to open it and I was like I don't know what the fuck this is it's like downloading Steam as a platform except it's a platform that you can

1001
01:20:24,526 --> 01:20:51,394
[SPEAKER_05]: make content in there's some stuff that's like extremely polished there's some stuff that's popular but it's not polished I do see like some of the stuff like the squid game inspired game like somehow some of that stuff worked its way into my TikTok algorithm but it does it always is weird because I feel like it involves screaming kids like it's and I'm always feel a little weird when I see that stuff on TikTok because I'm like this video is profiting off of some kid having a meltdown on Roblox I don't know that I love that

1002
01:20:51,374 --> 01:20:54,080
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a weird environment.

1003
01:20:54,301 --> 01:20:58,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen that stuff in a long time, though.

1004
01:20:58,390 --> 01:21:02,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I think finally I skipped enough of them where they stopped showing me Roblox videos.

1005
01:21:03,763 --> 01:21:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, I've not gotten a single Roblox video except for the Dead by Daylight one.

1006
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:11,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the Dead by Daylight one too, but that was a little more like one.

1007
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:12,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually kind of cool.

1008
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:15,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's weird.

1009
01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:22,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like watching it would be, to me, it's like watching somebody made a port of Dead by Daylight for the PlayStation 2.

1010
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,588
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation 1.

1011
01:21:24,628 --> 01:21:27,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like watching somebody made a port of that for the PS1.

1012
01:21:27,635 --> 01:21:28,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, yeah.

1013
01:21:28,837 --> 01:21:32,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, SGO100 Matt in chat says, my nephew who is nine plays a lot.

1014
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:35,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, his parents play with him, so they're able to moderate anything bad there.

1015
01:21:35,966 --> 01:21:38,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as much as I sit here and I go, I don't get Roblox.

1016
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an old man.

1017
01:21:40,172 --> 01:21:46,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to when I was 12 or 13, I was dialing into BBS systems.

1018
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you.

1019
01:21:48,412 --> 01:22:13,153
[SPEAKER_05]: there were definitely things happening in those environments that should not have been like like there were definitely adults that were talking to me when I was 13 which nothing nothing ever crossed the line at the time so it's this isn't that kind of story but looking back on it I go that's fucking weird that that happened when I was 13 you know and so it's just interesting yeah

1020
01:22:13,488 --> 01:22:18,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, since we were talking about Steam, Loki.

1021
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:19,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1022
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:30,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steam is overhauling their Steam review system, and so what the main change is going to be on it is that now, when you look at Steam reviews, they're only going to be of your language.

1023
01:22:30,805 --> 01:22:39,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that they're doing that is because some of the things that maybe, like, say a player that speaks English...

1024
01:22:39,374 --> 01:22:47,605
[SPEAKER_01]: is experiencing in a game, especially a game that has a lot of translations and stuff, may be different than somebody that is speaking a different language.

1025
01:22:47,625 --> 01:23:05,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for those games that have enough reviews, where the threshold is, I think, at least 2,000 reviews total, and of those, at least 200 written in a particular language, those are going to be the ones that kind of split out those reviews by region so that

1026
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:31,572
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a better understanding based on your region you know how the game is like say for example i was playing a jrpg that had just horrible absolutely the worst translations altogether like an english speaker might say oh well this game sucks it's poorly translated where in like say if it was just japanese or something like that it could be just perfectly fine in which case that would not necessarily reflect their experience

1027
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:55,602
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that's kind of where the the breakdown is there and they've um they're trying to do that to improve their system for uh you know including like translations culture cultural references network connections in different regions of the world obviously a thing with servers everywhere so that could be a thing with ping being like really bad in specific spots so it's just to give you a better um a more accurate review for your area i guess

1028
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:58,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's good.

1029
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:09,287
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of trying to do some things, especially with, you know, when people want to review bomb shit and, you know, like that you can sort of look at it or a game that's had a journey like No Man's Sky.

1030
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:11,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Very poorly reviewed when it came out.

1031
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:13,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know what we know the journey of No Man's Sky by now.

1032
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:15,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's received very well.

1033
01:24:15,775 --> 01:24:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe you want...

1034
01:24:17,097 --> 01:24:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Your review perspective to really only consider what's happened since the last patch or how people feel about, or the other way around, quite frankly, Final Fantasy XIV, not having a lot of great news around it lately, just with this latest expansion.

1035
01:24:30,934 --> 01:24:38,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they've ceased and desisted a very popular role-playing mod that has a lot of people pissed and are now review bombing.

1036
01:24:38,463 --> 01:24:42,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I think review bombing is a legitimate tactic to take against companies.

1037
01:24:42,307 --> 01:24:45,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's silly, but it certainly does get attention, I guess.

1038
01:24:45,992 --> 01:24:47,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1039
01:24:47,033 --> 01:24:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does also create a lot of noise when you're really trying to figure out what's going on with a particular game.

1040
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:53,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1041
01:24:53,911 --> 01:24:54,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, be interesting.

1042
01:24:55,370 --> 01:25:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can't wait to see how this game reviews because y'all haven't shut the fuck up about it for about seven years.

1043
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:06,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But Hollow Knight Silksong, Loki referenced this earlier in the show.

1044
01:25:06,589 --> 01:25:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It did show up at Gamescom opening night live.

1045
01:25:09,174 --> 01:25:13,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we got a specific sort of announcement release trailer that came later in the week.

1046
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:17,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And Silksong is coming real soon, like two weeks away.

1047
01:25:17,348 --> 01:25:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Silksong, September 4th.

1048
01:25:19,552 --> 01:25:23,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the next time we have an Orange Lounge Radio, you will all have played Silksong.

1049
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:28,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe not all of you, but some of you that have been chasing this game will have had your chance to play Silksong.

1050
01:25:29,406 --> 01:25:37,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently the game is available to play at Gamescom or was at Nintendo and Xbox booths, so I haven't heard a lot of the hands-on stuff, but that's...

1051
01:25:37,979 --> 01:25:39,060
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty interesting.

1052
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that game is finally coming out, and I'm sure it'll be good.

1053
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:47,410
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the stuff, I just give this game shit because the internet has sort of done this.

1054
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,693
[SPEAKER_05]: They've turned this into a thing.

1055
01:25:50,133 --> 01:25:55,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how these... On the internet, we tend to turn things into a thing that maybe don't need to be a thing?

1056
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,303
[SPEAKER_05]: The release of Hollow Knight Silksong became a thing.

1057
01:25:58,323 --> 01:26:02,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's no longer going to be a thing because it's finally fucking coming out.

1058
01:26:02,348 --> 01:26:03,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know...

1059
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,837
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through different eras in life.

1060
01:26:05,917 --> 01:26:07,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Battletoads era.

1061
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:09,223
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Silksong era.

1062
01:26:09,363 --> 01:26:09,804
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1063
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We can now all move towards Elder Scrolls 6.

1064
01:26:18,199 --> 01:26:19,622
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Metroid Prime 4?

1065
01:26:19,762 --> 01:26:22,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Because suddenly Nintendo's not talking about it anymore.

1066
01:26:22,346 --> 01:26:23,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you noticed that?

1067
01:26:24,537 --> 01:26:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did we get a whole direct?

1068
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:29,123
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that game is coming out in 2025.

1069
01:26:29,764 --> 01:26:32,408
[SPEAKER_05]: We get a whole direct about Kirby Air Ride.

1070
01:26:32,428 --> 01:26:33,990
[SPEAKER_05]: What have they said on Metroid Prime 4?

1071
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:36,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but Kirby Air Ride is right around the corner.

1072
01:26:37,055 --> 01:26:39,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but still, it's a little weird.

1073
01:26:39,418 --> 01:26:40,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1074
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:41,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fine.

1075
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:44,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf suggests GTA 6.

1076
01:26:44,485 --> 01:26:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good example too.

1077
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:50,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care when it's coming out at this point.

1078
01:26:50,954 --> 01:26:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come out when it comes out and we'll all celebrate it.

1079
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:54,688
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1080
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some people might be celebrating this next news article.

1081
01:26:57,351 --> 01:27:00,555
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1082
01:27:00,575 --> 01:27:01,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1083
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:06,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that this is definitely a cause for celebration.

1084
01:27:06,962 --> 01:27:08,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I a thousand percent am behind this.

1085
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:14,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bungie CEO, Pete Parsons, is retiring because shit sucks.

1086
01:27:14,811 --> 01:27:15,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

1087
01:27:18,655 --> 01:27:19,997
[SPEAKER_03]: He spent.

1088
01:27:20,097 --> 01:27:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we know the thing about his cars, right?

1089
01:27:23,414 --> 01:27:31,341
[SPEAKER_03]: about him spending like two and a half million on classic cars after the layoffs.

1090
01:27:31,422 --> 01:27:35,837
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite quote about him was said about his cars that I hope all of your cars break down.

1091
01:27:38,163 --> 01:27:40,946
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, he's leaving.

1092
01:27:40,966 --> 01:27:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: He is leaving the studio.

1093
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: He is going away.

1094
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:50,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was much rejoicing.

1095
01:27:50,096 --> 01:27:50,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1096
01:27:51,637 --> 01:27:53,599
[SPEAKER_03]: How about this one, Julie?

1097
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:56,462
[SPEAKER_05]: May all of your roads have the construction of Highway 50.

1098
01:27:59,405 --> 01:28:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking more of may all the roads have the quality of whatever that one leading to Long Beach is, but still...

1099
01:28:07,053 --> 01:28:08,115
[SPEAKER_03]: You know which one I'm talking about?

1100
01:28:08,135 --> 01:28:10,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 107 or whatever it is.

1101
01:28:10,839 --> 01:28:12,641
[SPEAKER_05]: 705, I think.

1102
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: 705, that's the one.

1103
01:28:14,324 --> 01:28:15,886
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bumpy.

1104
01:28:16,186 --> 01:28:17,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Never go on that road when you have to pee.

1105
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:19,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1106
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:20,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there is nowhere to stop.

1107
01:28:21,514 --> 01:28:23,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So, back to this.

1108
01:28:24,378 --> 01:28:26,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking over will be Justin Truman.

1109
01:28:27,783 --> 01:28:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to be taking over...

1110
01:28:32,551 --> 01:28:33,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1111
01:28:34,052 --> 01:28:42,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope he knows what he's in for because, well, Destiny 2 is kind of crap.

1112
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:45,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Marathon, in trouble.

1113
01:28:47,225 --> 01:28:49,447
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh my God.

1114
01:28:49,848 --> 01:29:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and then on top of that, there was the situation that went on with the Sony acquisition.

1115
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:03,826
[SPEAKER_03]: It's looking crazy.

1116
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:06,852
[SPEAKER_05]: This just feels like accountability six months too late.

1117
01:29:07,373 --> 01:29:15,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, there's been a lot of choices, trademark, when it comes to how things have been going with Destiny 2 and some of the recent stuff.

1118
01:29:16,049 --> 01:29:19,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, Marathon did not have...

1119
01:29:19,075 --> 01:29:21,539
[SPEAKER_05]: A warmly received alpha in some ways.

1120
01:29:21,559 --> 01:29:23,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's a lot of things they're needing to work on.

1121
01:29:24,124 --> 01:29:29,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's, you know, who makes a lot of the decisions that go into how these games end up in the state that they're in?

1122
01:29:29,513 --> 01:29:30,094
[SPEAKER_05]: The CEO.

1123
01:29:30,535 --> 01:29:32,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very rare that you see a CEO held accountable.

1124
01:29:32,919 --> 01:29:42,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially as you started off talking about the optics of, I'm laying people off, but I also have to polish my 15 collector vehicles.

1125
01:29:42,095 --> 01:29:42,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sucks.

1126
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:43,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1127
01:29:43,257 --> 01:29:50,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's... I don't like to celebrate people losing their jobs, but this is one case where I might make an exception.

1128
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a healthy thing for this company right now.

1129
01:29:53,275 --> 01:29:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: They obviously need new leadership.

1130
01:29:54,477 --> 01:30:00,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, except Truman may not be as great either.

1131
01:30:00,348 --> 01:30:00,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1132
01:30:02,873 --> 01:30:04,776
[SPEAKER_03]: He was...

1133
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:17,096
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the one who was also count at GDC 2023 where he warned about the dangers of over-delivery in the live service game because it was set too high of a standard.

1134
01:30:21,844 --> 01:30:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1135
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:24,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1136
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope all the people at the front lines at Bungie hang in there.

1137
01:30:29,876 --> 01:30:36,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, obviously this isn't the fault of anybody working hard on, you know, our art or programming or, you know, whatever.

1138
01:30:36,786 --> 01:30:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: It just always sucks to see those are the people that then end up in these layoff situations, which is unfortunate.

1139
01:30:43,034 --> 01:30:44,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

1140
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:44,657
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1141
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to something a little more happy, happy.

1142
01:30:48,141 --> 01:30:48,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

1143
01:30:49,583 --> 01:30:51,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pokemon World Championships.

1144
01:30:52,087 --> 01:30:53,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of announcements and stuff happening.

1145
01:30:55,246 --> 01:30:57,384
[SPEAKER_03]: My Pokemans, let me show you them.

1146
01:30:57,747 --> 01:30:58,775
[SPEAKER_05]: A little happy Pikachu.

1147
01:30:58,795 --> 01:30:59,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Pika.

1148
01:31:00,882 --> 01:31:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's kind of go down the list of some of the different things that they talked about and discussed.

1149
01:31:05,749 --> 01:31:09,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pokemon Go, new updates of course with that.

1150
01:31:09,235 --> 01:31:14,783
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had a trailer for Pokemon Go showing off some more legendary Pokemon.

1151
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,806
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Eternalis.

1152
01:31:18,048 --> 01:31:22,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I played a fuck ton of Pokemon Go yesterday with that whole Eternatus.

1153
01:31:22,034 --> 01:31:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how it's pronounced, but that was the raid I did at least 15 of them yesterday.

1154
01:31:26,621 --> 01:31:27,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like.

1155
01:31:28,203 --> 01:31:31,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we have that wrapped up today.

1156
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:36,118
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you were there, you were able to get that Pokemon early.

1157
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Pokemon TCG Pocket was getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall.

1158
01:31:44,433 --> 01:31:50,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Mega versions of Altillaria, Gyarados, and Blaziken.

1159
01:31:50,562 --> 01:31:54,207
[SPEAKER_01]: will be featured, I guess, in the app's new season.

1160
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:59,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokemon Unite is getting three more characters as well.

1161
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:04,483
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Emplorian, Delmise, and Vapirion coming to the game.

1162
01:32:05,184 --> 01:32:07,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.

1163
01:32:07,327 --> 01:32:11,773
[SPEAKER_01]: The physical trading card game is also getting more Mega Evolutions.

1164
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:16,300
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed off new EX cards for Mega Charizard X.

1165
01:32:16,786 --> 01:32:25,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Mega Gardevoir, Mega Lucario, and Mega Dragonite as well.

1166
01:32:25,992 --> 01:32:28,017
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the Megazord?

1167
01:32:28,037 --> 01:32:28,860
[SPEAKER_01]: No Megazords.

1168
01:32:29,662 --> 01:32:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn, could you imagine that as a Pokemon?

1169
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:45,295
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds really weird.

1170
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:52,825
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

1171
01:32:57,171 --> 01:32:58,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokemon Champions...

1172
01:32:59,193 --> 01:33:16,105
[SPEAKER_01]: and many more.

1173
01:33:16,085 --> 01:33:18,989
[SPEAKER_01]: of the World Championship Tournament in 2026.

1174
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:22,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Also announced is Pokemon XP.

1175
01:33:22,954 --> 01:33:28,541
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a new convention fan experience type thing.

1176
01:33:29,142 --> 01:33:30,664
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be happening.

1177
01:33:30,684 --> 01:33:36,091
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that apparently tickets will go on sale September 17th.

1178
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:44,202
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to feature panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.

1179
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:47,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1180
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:47,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool?

1181
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:49,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of Pokemon stuff.

1182
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a bummer.

1183
01:33:53,842 --> 01:34:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane was trying to tell me that he might come out to the Pokemon World Championships at Chase Center, which would be great to see my friend, but I feel like the time frame is going to be terrible.

1184
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:07,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard it might be during DragonCon next year, which, nope, that's a hard no for me.

1185
01:34:07,194 --> 01:34:10,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year's the 40th DragonCon, so I don't care what else is going on that weekend.

1186
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:11,739
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a must.

1187
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:15,522
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a bummer if the timing doesn't work out.

1188
01:34:15,502 --> 01:34:19,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have thought it might be a similar time frame where it's like one or two weeks before and I could swing that.

1189
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:20,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just San Francisco.

1190
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:21,210
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco is just a few hours away.

1191
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:21,951
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not that big a deal.

1192
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the drive that Portland was, that's for sure.

1193
01:34:25,817 --> 01:34:26,137
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1194
01:34:27,099 --> 01:34:34,048
[SPEAKER_05]: One game I am really looking forward to that is coming out, I think relatively soon, is the Mortal Kombat Collection.

1195
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just got announced this week, additional games.

1196
01:34:37,594 --> 01:34:44,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was rumored for a while that some of the spinoff Mortal Kombat games, including Mythologies Sub-Zero and

1197
01:34:44,223 --> 01:35:05,269
[SPEAKER_05]: and Special Forces may be included in

1198
01:35:05,249 --> 01:35:06,973
[SPEAKER_05]: is out as well.

1199
01:35:07,033 --> 01:35:12,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they are also adding what's called the WaveNet arcade version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

1200
01:35:12,586 --> 01:35:14,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what that was.

1201
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:18,580
[SPEAKER_05]: That implies that it must have been something where you could network arcades together or something.

1202
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I never experienced that.

1203
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:21,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious to learn about it.

1204
01:35:21,767 --> 01:35:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

1205
01:35:22,529 --> 01:35:49,802
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is again it's a digital eclipse game so it's that whole documentary style such as you know what you saw in the you know Tetris collection that they had recently and Atari 50 and those types of games really I think it's gonna be a great thing for this so yeah I will definitely pick this game up that's the Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection available pretty much everywhere on September 30th all right well since we're bringing up retro games what a great time for this segment let's get into this

1206
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:07,499
[SPEAKER_02]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1207
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1208
01:36:12,205 --> 01:36:18,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and DarkSakura is stepping into the gaming vault and finding a game for us to celebrate tonight.

1209
01:36:18,413 --> 01:36:19,655
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for us?

1210
01:36:20,436 --> 01:36:24,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, I have to dust off some cobwebs for this one even though it wasn't super long ago.

1211
01:36:25,442 --> 01:36:26,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The game is called Off.

1212
01:36:28,747 --> 01:36:30,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we remember off, everybody?

1213
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We had this before we had... Why can't I think of the name?

1214
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:38,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Deltarune.

1215
01:36:40,384 --> 01:36:41,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Undertale.

1216
01:36:42,066 --> 01:36:42,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1217
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:45,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking Claire Obscure because of all the French.

1218
01:36:45,151 --> 01:36:46,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I'll let you do your thing.

1219
01:36:47,596 --> 01:36:51,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So Off came out in 2008.

1220
01:36:51,225 --> 01:37:06,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a roleplay game that was done by a Belgian team called Unproductive Funtime that consisted of Mortis Ghost, also Martin Dioris, and is it

1221
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:08,203
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just this alias, or is it Elias?

1222
01:37:08,404 --> 01:37:10,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Elias Conrad Coldwood.

1223
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's Belgian.

1224
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about this human-ish entity called the Batter, who is on a sacred mission to, quote, purify the world of Off, basically ending eternal oblivion.

1225
01:37:30,442 --> 01:37:36,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So he goes to these four different zones in this world and reveals more about the world and combats.

1226
01:37:37,895 --> 01:37:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it got a big cult following.

1227
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I even played a fan translation back in the day.

1228
01:37:45,629 --> 01:37:52,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did get its official fan translation in 2011.

1229
01:37:53,287 --> 01:37:57,536
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are still past the 10-year period, even with the English translation.

1230
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:02,668
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember everybody was freaking into this.

1231
01:38:02,688 --> 01:38:03,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody.

1232
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:28,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft.com

1233
01:38:28,357 --> 01:38:40,028
[SPEAKER_03]: But Off has a system where your character is able to attack once a cooldown has passed, meaning that you can attack each other at the same time even enemies can.

1234
01:38:40,048 --> 01:38:44,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's encouraged that you make fast decisions.

1235
01:38:44,320 --> 01:39:06,092
[SPEAKER_03]: you can do like an auto option so it's basically just auto battler you also have an element system so instead of like you know earth wind fire water soul or whatever you have smoke metal plastic meat and sugar

1236
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:08,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, huh?

1237
01:39:09,021 --> 01:39:16,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go through four different zones that are labeled 0 through 3, and then you have a fifth one called The Room, which is the final act of the game.

1238
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:26,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only accessible once you have Zodiac cards that are acquired from different zones' guardians when they die.

1239
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:36,248
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go between them on a map that's called Nothingness.

1240
01:39:37,493 --> 01:39:54,237
[SPEAKER_03]: and the other thing is that you have a whole lot of puzzles some multi-digit passwords that you enter into a giant keypad missing book pages repeating room puzzles you go through multiple instances of the same room in the right order to escape

1241
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:55,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So all kinds of stuff.

1242
01:39:56,172 --> 01:40:01,587
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, the batter is a man in a baseball uniform who is out to purify the world.

1243
01:40:01,888 --> 01:40:06,100
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets guidance from a talking cat called the Judge.

1244
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:06,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1245
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:07,824
[SPEAKER_03]: My next cat's going to be called the Judge.

1246
01:40:08,907 --> 01:40:09,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1247
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to kill specters to purify the zone.

1248
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:17,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the guardian, you put them down and you keep going.

1249
01:40:18,826 --> 01:40:23,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But after each zone is purified, there are scenes of a sick boy named Hugo.

1250
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:30,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something about a connection between this boy and the zones.

1251
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:42,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to spoil the game in case someone, but the last zone is very much a series of non-linear puzzles that are supposed to belong to the boy Hugo.

1252
01:40:43,872 --> 01:40:48,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got some very resentful feelings.

1253
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:58,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a special ending where you can side with the judge, or you can side with the batter.

1254
01:40:58,971 --> 01:41:01,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say what you're doing with the two, but there is a

1255
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:05,490
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a difference of opinion.

1256
01:41:06,051 --> 01:41:11,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have a joke ending that involves space apes and it's very reminiscent of the Silent Hill dog ending.

1257
01:41:13,578 --> 01:41:17,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as this was developed, this was made with RPG Maker 2023.

1258
01:41:17,702 --> 01:41:22,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just made by Mortis and his buddies.

1259
01:41:22,307 --> 01:41:23,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, they were living together.

1260
01:41:26,751 --> 01:41:27,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It

1261
01:41:28,784 --> 01:41:36,094
[SPEAKER_03]: He lists things like Killer7, Silent Hill 2, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid 2, and an Agatha Christie novel.

1262
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:39,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were none and missed as inspirations.

1263
01:41:39,959 --> 01:41:43,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a very spontaneous development period.

1264
01:41:43,463 --> 01:41:48,690
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a demo on a small internet forum and people liked it.

1265
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So he decided to release a full game.

1266
01:41:50,873 --> 01:41:55,819
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there were the English translations that were out by September 8th, 2021.

1267
01:41:57,081 --> 01:41:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is going to be a remaster of OFF.

1268
01:42:00,265 --> 01:42:11,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It was announced this year and the original composer of the 2008 release, which is Coldwood, said he would not be involved in the development.

1269
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:20,610
[SPEAKER_03]: The publisher is Fangamer and they offered to reuse Coldwood's music but he refused to

1270
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it to be nervous about signing.

1271
01:42:22,734 --> 01:42:29,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have a new soundtrack for the remaster composed by seven different composers, including Toby Fox.

1272
01:42:29,427 --> 01:42:32,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll probably have a version of Megalopolis in it somewhere.

1273
01:42:33,074 --> 01:42:34,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Megalovania, sorry.

1274
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:40,803
[SPEAKER_03]: and Lee Morse's rendition, If You Want the Rainbow.

1275
01:42:42,547 --> 01:42:52,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slated, there is a Switch version that is slated for quarter one, 2026 and a physical copy.

1276
01:42:52,383 --> 01:42:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the game has been well praised for story, characters, atmosphere.

1277
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:08,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Heidi Klempz of PC Gamer called it a memorable and haunting RPG filled with tricky puzzles, bizarre symbolism, and challenging thematic elements.

1278
01:43:09,086 --> 01:43:13,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it has...

1279
01:43:14,236 --> 01:43:17,865
[SPEAKER_03]: A huge, you know, it had a huge fan base on Tumblr, believe it or not.

1280
01:43:17,885 --> 01:43:19,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually where I heard about it.

1281
01:43:19,849 --> 01:43:29,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the sixth most reblogged game of 2013, with the other five being AAA games.

1282
01:43:29,312 --> 01:43:29,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1283
01:43:30,314 --> 01:43:30,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Off.

1284
01:43:31,718 --> 01:43:38,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, very timely pick with that remaster on the way too, I was kind of like, oh that kind of worked out conveniently, didn't it?

1285
01:43:38,788 --> 01:43:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't thought of this game in a little bit, and then I was, believe it or not, I was looking up games made with RPG Maker And I saw it pop up on this, I was like, holy shit, yeah, I remember Off, and that's why I went for it Okay, no, it's a good pick, good times Any of y'all in chat play it?

1286
01:43:56,812 --> 01:44:02,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to... Well, let's look at the chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1287
01:44:02,519 --> 01:44:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's more people talking about Undertale.

1288
01:44:04,021 --> 01:44:07,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Tetsuya says, hadn't heard of it, also missed the whole Undertale thing.

1289
01:44:07,785 --> 01:44:14,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, that's... Especially with Remaster on the way soon, a great time to experience it.

1290
01:44:14,594 --> 01:44:18,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here, I absolutely recommend...

1291
01:44:19,036 --> 01:44:20,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and play it.

1292
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:21,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Play it now.

1293
01:44:21,905 --> 01:44:23,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a treasure.

1294
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:26,017
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very weird, but very good.

1295
01:44:26,117 --> 01:44:28,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite surrealist in aspects.

1296
01:44:28,625 --> 01:44:28,725
Yeah.

1297
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:29,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1298
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:33,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1299
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:38,738
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about some other things that are happening in the industry that you might have missed.

[SPEAKER_05]: As busy as I am, Saturday is really my worst day.

1307
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:28,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I have worst, best in many ways, but also worst because it's three panels back to back.

1308
01:45:28,956 --> 01:45:29,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So my most busy day.

1309
01:45:30,519 --> 01:45:35,225
[SPEAKER_05]: The other days I should be able to do an impromptu meetup like at the arcade or something.

[SPEAKER_05]: So conventions channel is a great place to find me over at vognetwork.com.

1311
01:45:39,311 --> 01:45:41,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's get into rapid fire news.

1312
01:45:41,534 --> 01:45:43,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Jamie, you're going to go first tonight, right?

1313
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yeah.

1314
01:45:45,623 --> 01:45:48,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So my favorite band ever in the universe, Gorillaz.

1315
01:45:48,831 --> 01:45:51,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the Gorillaz, just Gorillaz.

1316
01:45:52,299 --> 01:45:54,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So get it right, people, or I will find you.

1317
01:45:58,374 --> 01:46:00,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was...

1318
01:46:00,218 --> 01:46:07,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It was announced that Gorillaz is coming to Fortnite.

1319
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:12,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will be the next Fortnite festival headlining act.

1320
01:46:12,924 --> 01:46:20,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So the characters will appear as in-game skins and some of their music will be available for festival as well.

1321
01:46:22,392 --> 01:46:42,865
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah, the thought is and this is just the speculation on it is that 2D and Noodle will be in the shop and Murdoch and Russell will be available for Festival Pass so of course you know I'm going to have all of it forever so yeah

1322
01:46:44,752 --> 01:46:48,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to playing the songs in Festival because that seems, yeah, almost even.

1323
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:54,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I want so badly for them to put Oil in it, the duet with Stevie Nicks.

1324
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:55,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm.

1325
01:46:57,304 --> 01:46:58,407
[SPEAKER_05]: This song is so good.

1326
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:01,174
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, what do you have?

1327
01:47:01,897 --> 01:47:11,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so Shinobi The Art of Vengeance is getting Sega Villain Stage DLC, and they announced that it's going to have three guest villains.

1328
01:47:11,428 --> 01:47:15,613
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those guest villains is Dr. Eggman of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

1329
01:47:16,654 --> 01:47:17,355
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we know.

1330
01:47:18,136 --> 01:47:21,019
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds interesting, Dr. Eggman in a Shinobi game.

1331
01:47:21,820 --> 01:47:22,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1332
01:47:22,781 --> 01:47:23,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1333
01:47:23,222 --> 01:47:23,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sega.

1334
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:24,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sega.

1335
01:47:25,204 --> 01:47:25,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1336
01:47:25,645 --> 01:47:26,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they'll make it work.

1337
01:47:27,327 --> 01:47:31,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I know another game I'd like to see Dr. Eggman in, and that would be Overwatch 2.

1338
01:47:32,433 --> 01:47:33,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow I don't think that'll happen, though.

1339
01:47:33,995 --> 01:47:40,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But Overwatch 2 is getting a new season, Season 18, starting really in just a couple days, August 26th.

1340
01:47:41,343 --> 01:47:49,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And a pretty major change, and Jason referenced this in the intro tonight, but just to make it official, Overwatch 2 is going to change matchmaking

1341
01:47:49,653 --> 01:48:06,480
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

1342
01:48:06,460 --> 01:48:25,212
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1343
01:48:25,394 --> 01:48:28,558
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like playing Widowmaker on controller versus keyboard and mouse.

1344
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:30,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Two very different experiences.

1345
01:48:30,321 --> 01:48:36,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe if I remember right, you have a little bit of assist with aiming on controller that doesn't exist on keyboard mouse.

1346
01:48:36,549 --> 01:48:38,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, some things to consider.

1347
01:48:38,412 --> 01:48:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's, yeah, that's pretty cool.

1348
01:48:40,395 --> 01:48:42,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played Overwatch 2 in a long time.

1349
01:48:42,197 --> 01:48:46,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of, I want to, but do you know, you know what stops me at this point?

1350
01:48:46,403 --> 01:49:15,128
[SPEAKER_05]: well maybe I need to look into it I can't mask my battle tag name if I could do that I would play it again because I now use RobRob as my name and I don't want I don't necessarily want Overwatch shitlords knowing my name and I guess I should have known better when I checked my battle tag but since my entire online is like RobRob like yeah I don't know maybe I'm being silly but keyboard and mouse on a console is definitely not silly I'm excited for that

1351
01:49:16,475 --> 01:49:20,825
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out this week.

1352
01:49:20,845 --> 01:49:23,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's coming out in the US?

1388
01:53:03,935 --> 01:53:10,007
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a reference to, I think, some arcade era games that are obviously shooter games, as you can tell in the title.

[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1413
01:56:45,063 --> 01:56:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had said... We ain't found shit.

1414
01:56:47,367 --> 01:56:51,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had said that they emailed us on Bobby's show and I didn't see it.

1415
01:56:51,636 --> 01:56:54,942
[SPEAKER_05]: So participate at orange.trader.com is the place to send emails.

1416
01:56:55,303 --> 01:56:56,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Just double check that email.

1417
01:56:56,245 --> 01:57:00,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's a real email, just free forwarded it because everything that was in there looked like it had been spam.

1418
01:57:00,714 --> 01:57:01,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1419
01:57:01,275 --> 01:57:01,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1420
01:57:01,756 --> 01:57:03,038
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1421
01:57:03,018 --> 01:57:06,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so we do have a caller and we haven't talked to this person in a little while.

1422
01:57:06,782 --> 01:57:08,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to Skype.

1423
01:57:09,405 --> 01:57:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1424
01:57:10,746 --> 01:57:12,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1425
01:57:12,228 --> 01:57:13,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey, everybody.

1426
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:15,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one and only Ranma.

1427
01:57:15,731 --> 01:57:17,153
[SPEAKER_08]: How is everybody doing tonight?

1428
01:57:17,173 --> 01:57:18,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

1429
01:57:18,034 --> 01:57:18,394
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1430
01:57:18,414 --> 01:57:18,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Invited you.

1431
01:57:21,697 --> 01:57:24,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as you must know.

1432
01:57:24,881 --> 01:57:25,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you mean it.

1433
01:57:25,922 --> 01:57:27,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you mean it.

1434
01:57:27,638 --> 01:57:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You know about that?

1435
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:33,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Chad is apparently telling me that my brain malfunctioned and I said Skype.

1436
01:57:33,926 --> 01:57:36,350
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say one thing for 15 years, habits are hard to break.

1437
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:38,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord.

1438
01:57:39,674 --> 01:57:42,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, you look like you're in New Digs now.

1439
01:57:42,598 --> 01:57:46,263
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is the same place I've been in for the last year or so.

1440
01:57:46,443 --> 01:57:47,264
[SPEAKER_08]: New Light?

1441
01:57:48,406 --> 01:57:53,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was too lazy to get up and turn on the ceiling light, that's all.

1442
01:57:53,373 --> 01:57:54,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, gotcha.

1443
01:57:54,154 --> 01:57:56,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well to what do we owe the privilege tonight?

1444
01:57:56,056 --> 01:57:56,717
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1445
01:57:57,524 --> 01:58:01,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's something that you brought up early on in the show.

1446
01:58:01,937 --> 01:58:09,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about Saturday morning Mega Mix beat-em-up Smash game.

1447
01:58:10,467 --> 01:58:16,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, our little fantasy for a, I don't know, Saturday morning showdown or whatever we're going to call it.

1448
01:58:16,434 --> 01:58:22,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there was a game called Saturday Night Slammasters that Capcom did that was a wrestling thing in the Street Fighter era.

1449
01:58:22,220 --> 01:58:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But like Saturday morning Smackdown or something along those lines.

1450
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:31,131
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't want it to be restricted to Saturday morning because like somebody pointed out, He-Man was a primetime cartoon.

1451
01:58:31,371 --> 01:58:33,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have all the Nickelodeon shit in there necessarily.

1452
01:58:34,394 --> 01:58:35,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Childhood chaos.

1453
01:58:36,136 --> 01:58:36,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.

1454
01:58:36,697 --> 01:58:37,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1455
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:37,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Childhood chaos.

1456
01:58:37,938 --> 01:58:38,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.

1457
01:58:38,779 --> 01:58:39,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1458
01:58:40,623 --> 01:58:43,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make a nomination.

1459
01:58:43,226 --> 01:58:45,949
[SPEAKER_08]: This goes on the list of OLR Dream Games.

1460
01:58:45,989 --> 01:58:48,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, step before the council and make your suggestion.

1461
01:58:51,436 --> 01:58:55,340
[SPEAKER_05]: The council will now hear from Ranma, citizen of New York.

1462
01:58:57,022 --> 01:59:02,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I want this to be an OLR Dream Game.

1463
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 bucks if anyone knows that reference YYR is very busy though he's got a child now he can't keep making our wishes come true he has his own projects he wants to work on too

1464
01:59:13,597 --> 01:59:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair, Loki also has other projects because Loki did do Pixel Poops number two.

1465
01:59:17,661 --> 01:59:22,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And also this is like a million, billions of dollars worth of licensing.

1466
01:59:22,206 --> 01:59:32,117
[SPEAKER_05]: The licenses are going to make this hard to be an indie game, but we can still say it's an OLR dream game that we need a AAA studio to produce.

1467
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:41,967
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Ubisoft, if you want us to ever forgive you, spend the money on this instead of AI slop, that would be the type of thing we would need.

1468
01:59:42,571 --> 01:59:59,415
[SPEAKER_08]: please do not get me started on AI they've rolled out perplexity to everybody at work and I'm just like I don't even know what the fuck that is and I don't want to know it's another I don't want to know I can't, no comment

1469
01:59:59,952 --> 02:00:03,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look, it doesn't matter where you work.

1470
02:00:03,259 --> 02:00:05,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Your job is looking at how can AI help us.

1471
02:00:05,904 --> 02:00:07,427
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter where you work.

1472
02:00:07,647 --> 02:00:14,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if you're at a store or a place you wouldn't think, like retail, they're still looking at how is AI going to help us.

1473
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,843
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all looking at it.

1474
02:00:16,204 --> 02:00:18,248
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it is what it is.

1475
02:00:18,228 --> 02:00:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when computers first came out.

1476
02:00:21,074 --> 02:00:22,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard it compared to that.

1477
02:00:22,136 --> 02:00:30,193
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a time, believe it or not, there was a day when we didn't have computers, and then computers became personal computers, and that changed a lot of industries as we know it.

1478
02:00:30,273 --> 02:00:32,437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we had computers, but they were human.

1479
02:00:33,018 --> 02:00:33,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1480
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:34,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, that's true.

1481
02:00:34,742 --> 02:00:38,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, AI is a similar sort of thing, so...

1482
02:00:38,630 --> 02:00:38,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1483
02:00:39,752 --> 02:00:43,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go on a tangent about that, but this is not about that.

1484
02:00:43,859 --> 02:00:49,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say that if we're going to go down this route, we need the Smurfs.

1485
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:51,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We need Alf.

1486
02:00:52,134 --> 02:00:53,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else do we need?

1487
02:00:53,897 --> 02:00:56,301
[SPEAKER_05]: If we got Alf, we'd be the official game of Blue Sky.

1488
02:00:57,343 --> 02:01:01,110
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also need a kid video for intermissions and bonus rounds.

1489
02:01:02,879 --> 02:01:03,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I support it.

1490
02:01:04,902 --> 02:01:05,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are good picks.

1491
02:01:05,983 --> 02:01:10,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if the Smurfs is Gargamel's cat would be the character I would nominate.

1492
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Muppet Babies.

1493
02:01:14,213 --> 02:01:15,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, yes.

1494
02:01:15,495 --> 02:01:16,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Muppet Babies.

1495
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:23,124
[SPEAKER_05]: No, their playroom needs to be a stage and you have the nanny legs come in every now and then and change the stage.

1496
02:01:23,905 --> 02:01:27,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Nanny's gonna be a stage fatality.

1497
02:01:28,070 --> 02:01:30,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, when did our game have fatalities?

1498
02:01:31,014 --> 02:01:31,114
Yeah.

1499
02:01:32,022 --> 02:01:39,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you're fighting the boss, the screen can change.

1500
02:01:39,253 --> 02:01:43,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say it.

1501
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1502
02:01:45,783 --> 02:01:50,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the other thing is that like the Muppet Babies, I think the character from Muppet Babies should be Skeeter.

1503
02:01:51,252 --> 02:01:53,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And in every introduction, it should be, who the fuck are you?

1504
02:01:59,565 --> 02:02:00,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1505
02:02:01,722 --> 02:02:02,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Rob.

1506
02:02:04,445 --> 02:02:05,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Rob.

1507
02:02:07,268 --> 02:02:10,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, literally, they erased Skeeter from the reboot, if I remember right.

1508
02:02:10,711 --> 02:02:12,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't they replace her with somebody else?

1509
02:02:12,753 --> 02:02:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a new character?

1510
02:02:14,194 --> 02:02:16,136
[SPEAKER_03]: The name Skeeter is a little bit questionable.

1511
02:02:16,176 --> 02:02:17,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to say that right now.

1512
02:02:17,378 --> 02:02:21,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the official game of Blue Sky, if we had Skeeter playable in the game.

1513
02:02:22,042 --> 02:02:23,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what about Scooter?

1514
02:02:24,024 --> 02:02:25,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, they could have twin tests.

1515
02:02:25,466 --> 02:02:28,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Scooter's actually a character in the actual level.

1516
02:02:28,469 --> 02:02:29,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Scooter's a real person.

1517
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:38,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back and watch Muppet Babies and pretend that Skeeter is a figment of Scooter's imagination and the show takes a whole new angle.

1518
02:02:39,942 --> 02:02:41,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Also smoke weed beforehand.

1519
02:02:42,746 --> 02:02:43,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Allegedly.

1520
02:02:45,509 --> 02:02:49,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to know I do this at work on my breaks.

1521
02:02:49,355 --> 02:02:52,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I go on YouTube Smoke weed and watch Muppet Babies?

1522
02:02:52,279 --> 02:02:54,822
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of fucking workplace are you at?

1523
02:02:54,842 --> 02:02:55,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Sign me up.

1524
02:02:56,465 --> 02:02:57,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you hiring?

1525
02:02:58,268 --> 02:03:05,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a workplace where you get three weeks of mandatory PTO, just saying.

1526
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:10,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's just those edibles, you know, when you can slide it into your lunch and nobody knows the difference.

1527
02:03:10,767 --> 02:03:19,300
[SPEAKER_08]: There are times I will sit there and watch YouTube videos of classic 80s commercials, okay?

1528
02:03:22,503 --> 02:03:41,153
[SPEAKER_05]: and there are people who have uploaded their entire Saturday morning cartoon playlist with the commercials intact I fucking love that shit when they do that they keep the commercials intact absolutely quick what's a commercial jingle that comes to mind from the 80s oh god

1529
02:03:42,230 --> 02:03:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to block some of this out when I'm not at work.

1530
02:03:45,456 --> 02:03:53,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one for me is an extremely regional thing, like you East Coasters aren't going to get it, but it's Merry Christmas from Thrifties and Payless.

1531
02:03:53,954 --> 02:03:55,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, y'all aren't going to understand.

1532
02:03:55,417 --> 02:03:57,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never heard that before, you know that.

1533
02:03:57,080 --> 02:03:58,042
[SPEAKER_05]: You're never going to understand.

1534
02:03:58,262 --> 02:03:58,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I have.

1535
02:03:59,164 --> 02:04:00,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, see, Loki understands.

1536
02:04:00,226 --> 02:04:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know what Thrifties is, but because I've had the ice cream.

1537
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:14,129
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, before Rite Aid went away to Dodo Bird, I did see a lot of thrifty stuff in my local store before it became a cheap supermarket.

1538
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because the ice cream was the ice cream of legends.

1539
02:04:18,077 --> 02:04:20,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And thrifty ice cream, I believe, still lives on to this day.

1540
02:04:21,003 --> 02:04:25,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever bought Rite Aid, Walgreens, you can still find thrifty ice cream, but...

1541
02:04:25,733 --> 02:04:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: find me a fucking thrifty ice cream counter those are we have a few Rite-Aids aren't completely gone here and so we have a few Rite-Aids just a few that are left that have the counters in them that is the stuff of fucking legends right there and uh yeah Ranmari says uh thrifty cylindrical scoop that's right they had the the perfect little you can buy those on Amazon you can yeah

1542
02:04:51,586 --> 02:04:59,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I do remember one regional jingle for New York Telephone before it became Verizon, and they would play it on all their commercials.

1543
02:05:00,798 --> 02:05:02,981
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I wouldn't know this, being a California kid.

1544
02:05:03,862 --> 02:05:04,743
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1545
02:05:04,763 --> 02:05:06,205
[SPEAKER_05]: What, you're gonna tell us that and not sing it?

1546
02:05:06,305 --> 02:05:07,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna tell us that and not sing it?

1547
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:10,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1548
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:12,994
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all connected, New York Telephone.

1549
02:05:15,857 --> 02:05:16,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_05]: Sold.

[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy five.

1552
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1553
02:05:20,948 --> 02:05:22,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, we're 80s kids.

1554
02:05:23,431 --> 02:05:24,853
[SPEAKER_08]: We're 80s kids.

1555
02:05:25,074 --> 02:05:27,036
[SPEAKER_08]: There is one jingle from the 80s.

1556
02:05:27,056 --> 02:05:27,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1557
02:05:27,777 --> 02:05:30,481
[SPEAKER_08]: We should all know.

1558
02:05:30,501 --> 02:05:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I know one, though, from Mobile, and it was kind of all over the area.

1559
02:05:34,566 --> 02:05:36,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for Cockerell's Body Shop.

1560
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:37,390
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1561
02:05:37,410 --> 02:05:39,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very country.

1562
02:05:41,976 --> 02:05:42,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1563
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1564
02:05:45,281 --> 02:05:48,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Cockerell's Body Shop, we love your automobile.

1565
02:05:50,187 --> 02:05:50,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

1566
02:05:52,285 --> 02:06:22,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Pussy Cow, Pussy Cow, Pussy Cow

1567
02:06:22,272 --> 02:06:26,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan has shown me these old commercials, by the way.

1568
02:06:26,622 --> 02:06:27,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The pussy cow commercials?

1569
02:06:29,328 --> 02:06:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1570
02:06:29,569 --> 02:06:33,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I barely remember he showed me one once.

1571
02:06:34,928 --> 02:07:03,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, my brother in Christ

1572
02:07:04,358 --> 02:07:07,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You got me thinking of the Golden Girls now, because let's be real.

1573
02:07:07,922 --> 02:07:12,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of us thought they said a heart attack, okay?

1574
02:07:12,808 --> 02:07:13,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of us thought that.

1575
02:07:14,991 --> 02:07:16,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shut the fuck up, Loki.

1576
02:07:16,934 --> 02:07:18,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You found one?

1577
02:07:18,355 --> 02:07:30,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I apologize because you guys on Discord won't hear this, but I have to play this for the live audience because this is so fucking legendary.

1578
02:07:30,991 --> 02:07:31,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1579
02:07:32,012 --> 02:07:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1580
02:07:32,333 --> 02:07:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Pussy Cow commercial, okay?

1581
02:07:33,834 --> 02:07:34,315
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

1582
02:07:36,438 --> 02:07:39,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's Cal Worthington and his dog Spot!

1583
02:07:39,022 --> 02:07:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, why did you pick a commercial where Cal Worthington doesn't have a fucking shirt on?

1584
02:07:42,887 --> 02:07:43,989
[SPEAKER_05]: This man is like in his 70s.

1585
02:07:44,029 --> 02:07:45,310
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the first one that was on the list.

1586
02:07:45,330 --> 02:07:46,652
[SPEAKER_05]: This man's in his 70s.

1587
02:07:46,732 --> 02:07:47,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1588
02:07:47,714 --> 02:07:49,436
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want it better, buy Go See Cal.

1589
02:07:49,616 --> 02:07:51,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the guy we satisfy.

1590
02:07:51,779 --> 02:07:52,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Go See Cal.

1591
02:07:52,861 --> 02:07:54,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Give a new car to your wife.

1592
02:07:54,163 --> 02:07:55,565
[SPEAKER_03]: She will love you all her life.

1593
02:07:55,585 --> 02:07:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Go See Cal.

1594
02:07:56,246 --> 02:07:56,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Go See Cal.

1595
02:07:56,947 --> 02:07:57,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Go See Cal.

1596
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,630
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1597
02:08:00,352 --> 02:08:01,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It says Pussy Cal.

1598
02:08:01,774 --> 02:08:03,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me it doesn't say Pussy Cal.

1599
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:10,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost spit my water across my screen.

1600
02:08:10,077 --> 02:08:12,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost did that.

1601
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:13,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Pussy cow.

1602
02:08:18,087 --> 02:08:19,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I will watch this later.

1603
02:08:20,010 --> 02:08:27,259
[SPEAKER_01]: The top comment on that, if you look at the top comment from three years ago on that video, for years, I always thought it was pussy cow.

1604
02:08:27,319 --> 02:08:30,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea it was pussy cow.

1605
02:08:35,129 --> 02:08:36,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is losing his shit live on air.

1606
02:08:37,472 --> 02:08:39,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I even have the wrong shot.

1607
02:08:39,575 --> 02:08:41,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I used the shot that took Loki out.

1608
02:08:41,218 --> 02:08:43,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't help it.

1609
02:08:45,504 --> 02:08:46,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the pussy cow of my childhood.

1610
02:08:47,006 --> 02:08:48,348
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

1611
02:08:49,009 --> 02:08:51,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You never forget your first pussy cow.

1612
02:08:51,973 --> 02:08:53,956
[SPEAKER_05]: You never forget your first pussy cow.

1613
02:08:57,021 --> 02:08:58,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that our new catchphrase?

1614
02:08:58,923 --> 02:09:00,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1615
02:09:00,426 --> 02:09:03,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's an unlockable character is Cal Worthington and his dog Spot.

1616
02:09:03,493 --> 02:09:03,713
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1617
02:09:03,754 --> 02:09:06,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, rest in rest in peace.

1618
02:09:06,961 --> 02:09:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace.

1619
02:09:09,286 --> 02:09:11,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1620
02:09:11,330 --> 02:09:11,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1621
02:09:12,112 --> 02:09:14,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, where are you going to take the show next?

1622
02:09:14,337 --> 02:09:16,481
[SPEAKER_05]: You've made us go down the rabbit hole of pussy cow.

1623
02:09:16,602 --> 02:09:17,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what?

1624
02:09:20,017 --> 02:09:30,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I called in before I decided to do an edible or something else I'm kind of glad I did Why aren't you sharing with me?

1625
02:09:32,791 --> 02:09:33,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I love and trust you.

1626
02:09:34,794 --> 02:09:35,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to my house right now.

1627
02:09:37,938 --> 02:09:41,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I should do it because I just recently restocked.

1628
02:09:41,022 --> 02:09:46,489
[SPEAKER_05]: You should, you should, I can't say, but you should definitely try to come to Fanime next year.

1629
02:09:46,949 --> 02:09:48,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong wink, strong nudge.

1630
02:09:48,431 --> 02:09:50,094
[SPEAKER_05]: You should definitely try to come to Fanime next year.

1631
02:09:52,497 --> 02:09:54,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny you should mention that.

1632
02:09:55,808 --> 02:10:03,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been saying off and on for the last few years that there are conventions 20 years ago I wanted to go to, but I could not afford them because finances.

1633
02:10:04,357 --> 02:10:13,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I'm in a position where I can take the time off that I want, and I have the money to go to these conventions, and I really haven't.

1634
02:10:13,408 --> 02:10:16,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided to do a couple of trips to Japan and still go to cons.

1635
02:10:17,052 --> 02:10:19,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still putting together 2026.

1636
02:10:19,670 --> 02:10:22,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I think maybe a reunion tour might be in order.

1637
02:10:23,015 --> 02:10:23,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

1638
02:10:24,216 --> 02:10:24,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

1639
02:10:25,698 --> 02:10:26,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

1640
02:10:27,861 --> 02:10:28,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1641
02:10:28,462 --> 02:10:32,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could take your bestie in the entire universe, DarkSakura, to Japan with you.

1642
02:10:36,794 --> 02:10:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, I am going in 2026 because my con kid wants to go and she really loves her Kirby, so...

1643
02:10:49,252 --> 02:10:50,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to go.

1644
02:10:50,736 --> 02:10:52,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me when you do that.

1645
02:10:52,259 --> 02:10:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: If I have the money for it.

1646
02:10:53,482 --> 02:10:59,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me when you do that because if Shad's still there, I might go and I'll try to time it.

1647
02:11:00,139 --> 02:11:01,843
[SPEAKER_05]: But it depends on if he's still there or not.

1648
02:11:02,988 --> 02:11:05,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if he's there or not, you should still go.

1649
02:11:05,192 --> 02:11:08,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I do want to go.

1650
02:11:09,459 --> 02:11:13,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking at doing a cruise, a second cruise next year, and I don't think it's going to pan out.

1651
02:11:13,206 --> 02:11:16,291
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on a waiting list that I hear is hundreds of people long, so I don't think that's going to pan out.

1652
02:11:16,311 --> 02:11:18,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we might have the bandwidth to do something big.

1653
02:11:18,635 --> 02:11:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1654
02:11:19,176 --> 02:11:20,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get too ahead of myself.

1655
02:11:20,519 --> 02:11:26,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that I want to go to Kyoto for the Miyako Odori.

1656
02:11:31,135 --> 02:11:33,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, we gotta wrap up the show.

1657
02:11:33,658 --> 02:11:35,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're making me want to spend money.

1658
02:11:35,179 --> 02:11:36,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, I should let you go.

1659
02:11:36,661 --> 02:11:38,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But do you have any other final thoughts for our listeners?

1660
02:11:39,744 --> 02:11:41,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to grow up.

1661
02:11:41,285 --> 02:11:42,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Toys R Us kid.

1662
02:11:42,747 --> 02:11:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a million Toys R Us that I can play with.

1663
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:49,353
[SPEAKER_05]: From book to trains to video games.

1664
02:11:49,774 --> 02:11:50,614
[SPEAKER_05]: There is.

1665
02:11:50,655 --> 02:11:53,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob doesn't remember the lyrics.

1666
02:11:53,898 --> 02:11:59,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Japan, you still run the tags to the front at Toys R Us.

1667
02:12:00,144 --> 02:12:01,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something

1668
02:12:02,185 --> 02:12:05,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Japan, Toys R Us still exists.

1669
02:12:05,969 --> 02:12:11,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in Ikebukuro walking through Sunshine City and I saw the Toys R Us.

1670
02:12:12,215 --> 02:12:15,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I stared and I wiped a tear away.

1671
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:19,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like... But if it doesn't smell like Toys R Us, it won't work for me.

1672
02:12:19,222 --> 02:12:23,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just telling you, Toys R Us had a very distinctive smell of Warehouse and Kmart.

1673
02:12:23,567 --> 02:12:26,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, you know the place I have to go to.

1674
02:12:28,992 --> 02:12:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey?

1675
02:12:29,453 --> 02:12:29,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey?

1676
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:55,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun Dun

1677
02:12:55,831 --> 02:12:57,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1678
02:12:57,173 --> 02:12:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I'm so down.

1679
02:12:59,916 --> 02:13:03,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to a Mega Donkey in Nagoya and found Choco Cat stuff.

1680
02:13:04,621 --> 02:13:13,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was thinking of the Mega Donkey, because I mean, I would probably have to go to Tokyo first before I make my way to Kyoto.

1681
02:13:14,453 --> 02:13:18,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the plus side, there's hundreds of Don Quixote stores all over, most are 24 hours.

1682
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1683
02:13:22,362 --> 02:13:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go to that one in particular.

1684
02:13:24,299 --> 02:13:47,320
[SPEAKER_03]: but you definitely gotta go to one Akihabara though tons of anime stuff well and then I want to go to where the luxury stores are in Shibuya, basically the pawn stores that sell luxury goods oh yes yes yes yes I mean something about getting an Hermes bag for 4 grand instead of 20 grand

1685
02:13:48,430 --> 02:13:51,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I have that money anyway, but it'd be nice to think about it for five minutes.

1686
02:13:52,694 --> 02:13:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, we gotta wrap it up, but do you have any final thoughts for us tonight?

1687
02:13:57,739 --> 02:14:02,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Toys R Us Jingle was my final thought, and then we just kind of derailed yet again, because I love you guys.

1688
02:14:02,663 --> 02:14:02,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1689
02:14:03,064 --> 02:14:03,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love you too.

1690
02:14:03,784 --> 02:14:04,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for calling in.

1691
02:14:04,425 --> 02:14:05,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always good to hear from you.

1692
02:14:06,547 --> 02:14:07,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care.

1693
02:14:07,127 --> 02:14:07,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, buddy.

1694
02:14:07,888 --> 02:14:08,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1695
02:14:08,569 --> 02:14:08,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1696
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:12,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, it's time for us to give our final thoughts.

1697
02:14:12,792 --> 02:14:13,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

1698
02:14:13,233 --> 02:14:15,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, let me check in real quick, Loki, with any last-minute stories.

1699
02:14:17,101 --> 02:14:17,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think so.

1700
02:14:17,742 --> 02:14:18,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing.

1701
02:14:18,603 --> 02:14:19,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked.

1702
02:14:19,324 --> 02:14:20,225
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1703
02:14:20,265 --> 02:14:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

02:14:25,252 --> 02:14:28,456
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1706
02:14:29,297 --> 02:14:30,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1707
02:14:30,979 --> 02:14:34,424
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or YouTube.

1708
02:14:34,444 --> 02:14:37,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Wherever you found this show, it goes an awful long way.

02:14:45,457 --> 02:14:54,968

02:14:56,489 --> 02:14:58,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the weather isn't too crazy.

1716
02:14:58,211 --> 02:15:04,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hearing some stuff out of Burning Man and I have some friends up there that the dust storms up there are hellish this year.

1717
02:15:04,798 --> 02:15:09,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really keeping y'all burners in my thoughts that are up there right now and hoping y'all are hanging in there.

1718
02:15:09,844 --> 02:15:10,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those of you who...

1719
02:15:10,865 --> 02:15:12,688
[SPEAKER_03]: God's punishment for going to Burning Man.

1720
02:15:12,728 --> 02:15:16,093

[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you going to conventions indoors, I hope you are hanging in there and having a good time.
