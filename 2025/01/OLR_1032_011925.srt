1
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:12,738
[SPEAKER_09]: isn't the obvious headline tonight.

2
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't do this because I'm sick.

3
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:28,428
[SPEAKER_09]: What gave you that idea?

4
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:29,669
[SPEAKER_09]: This is me burying the lead.

5
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:34,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about the big stories and other pinches of gaming news.

6
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:37,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel better, Jason.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody out there on the internet.

9
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:47,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:56,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again, episode number 1032 of our program tonight, January the 19th of 2025.

11
00:00:57,343 --> 00:01:04,825
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:05,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.

13
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi!

14
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

15
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Jason's under the weather this week from the intro, but hopefully you're doing a lot better.

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:20,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's my usual vocal issues have been going on, but my migraine has abated for today, so that's good.

17
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:23,359
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good, because migraines are literally the worst thing ever.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm actually going through new treatment for my migraines, although I really wish they would approve the Botox.

19
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:30,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been a great...

20
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:37,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And people sometimes don't realize that Botox is for more than just, you know, real housewife usage.

21
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:39,968
[SPEAKER_03]: It has medical merits as well.

22
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The appearance of a brow lift would have been nice.

23
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm just saying.

24
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes the side effects aren't so bad.

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not so bad.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

27
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:52,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

29
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:54,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

30
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,032
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

31
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:56,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing alright.

32
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy.

33
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:00,167
[SPEAKER_03]: What a week, huh?

34
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been a week.

35
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:08,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I notice behind you tonight you got Minecraft going on tonight.

36
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:08,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this one of your videos?

37
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not one of my videos.

38
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:14,223
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my fellow cast members' videos.

39
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:14,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

40
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:19,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Jessix, his season finale for season three.

41
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:22,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did this whole kind of... I've seen them in chat before.

42
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Star Wars, but not Star Wars.

43
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he had the Mighty Imperium and stuff like that.

44
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Legally distinct Star Wars.

45
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:31,473
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:45,462
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

47
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:59,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and we hope you all will check us out live sometimes because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, VOG Network.

48
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been doing this show a long time.

49
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:10,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And over these years, it's sometimes interesting to look back on things and go, boy, we sure got that right or we sure got that wrong.

50
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:11,939
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:27,384
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:03:55,131 --> 00:04:03,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, and I think we kind of landed on, yeah, it's non-zero that it'll happen this week.

53
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,318
[SPEAKER_03]: We felt pretty good it would happen that week.

54
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:08,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think where I used non-zero was, and it will be announced Monday.

55
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:12,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they didn't really announce anything, right?

56
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:14,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you're going to get into this, Loki, with the kickoff topic.

57
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:19,889
[SPEAKER_03]: But in looking back, obviously, they kind of dropped that trailer on us Thursday with no announcement.

58
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:20,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was interesting because...

59
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,490
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So I replied and I said, well, you know what they might do?

61
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They might just drop a two minute trailer that that's it.

62
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:59,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not like people are kind of saying are expecting like a press event, but they'll probably just drop like a two minute trailer, kind of similar to how would the original Nintendo Switch be.

63
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,148
[SPEAKER_03]: They dropped in October, and I'm going to come back to this later.

64
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:09,213
[SPEAKER_03]: In October, they dropped an original kind of like two-minute trailer to show what made the switch the switch, right?

65
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:12,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go to bed and I wake up the next morning.

66
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:15,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, keep in mind, they dropped that video at what, like 10 Eastern?

67
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 7 here.

68
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I get up at like 7.15.

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,841
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing I woke up to...

70
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:31,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a notification from Blue Sky on my phone where somebody replied to that and said, Soothsayer.

71
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, uh-oh.

72
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:37,055
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

73
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:37,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they do it?

74
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:41,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, I go online and it dropped a two-minute train.

75
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, the way that was confirmed for me was somebody calling me a soothsayer.

76
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you know, so I just laughed.

77
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:48,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I don't...

78
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:57,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't take credit for forecasting this one because this was really a process of elimination type of scenario, right?

79
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:06,314
[SPEAKER_03]: All that's left at this point is for them to do a two-minute little teaser announce, and that's going to be that.

80
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:08,115
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will turn it over to Loki.

81
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Nintendo Switch 2, it happened.

82
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:12,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a two-minute look.

83
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:18,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do our seven-hour YouTube on everything that is absolutely undeniably true about the Nintendo Switch 2.

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that you saw is basically what you saw.

85
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:23,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

86
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:25,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all of the leaks.

87
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:33,165
[SPEAKER_03]: The two minute teaser was actually, it was just that clip from Star Wars Episode 7 where Harrison Ford goes, it's true.

88
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:34,146
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

89
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:34,586
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

90
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was the Switch 2 logo.

91
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:36,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

92
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:37,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the announced trailer.

93
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:47,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so basically confirming everything that has been rumored and all the peripherals that are not final, you know, all that stuff, essentially.

94
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't go into any details on anything other than what stuff looks like.

95
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:58,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people are reading between the lines somewhat on that.

96
00:06:58,165 --> 00:06:58,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know...

97
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:03,767
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, oh, the Joy-Cons can be used as mice or something like that.

98
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, though, that everything is bigger.

99
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: The system is bigger.

100
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The Joy-Cons are bigger.

101
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,129
[SPEAKER_02]: They are magnetically connected.

102
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:13,930
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no more rail system anymore.

103
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, I mean, the dock looks new as well.

104
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:22,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cover the whole screen, which is kind of interesting, I guess.

105
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that, you know,

106
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:30,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart 9 is coming because that's what they showed off.

107
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they are going to be going into more details.

108
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Mario Kart 9?

109
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:38,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

110
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:39,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already been leaked that it was 9.

111
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:43,122
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, and Bobby brought up a good point on his show.

112
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a little wiggle room there for a different name that we might find out in April.

113
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll see.

114
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:15,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

115
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:22,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, because we want to be very particular about it.

116
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:27,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, there already is a Mario Kart 9 with Mario Kart Tour, but that's a whole game.

117
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,594
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was trying to tell you last week.

118
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I still think it's going to be Mario Kart 9.

119
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:40,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Even still, because I don't think they're going to acknowledge the, you know, aside from bringing the tracks over, I don't think they're really going to acknowledge the mobile game at all.

120
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:54,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, yeah, so Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 on April 2nd, which I guess that blows out the whole quarter one launch out of the water, so that's

121
00:08:55,445 --> 00:09:04,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to be fair with all my, you know, soothsayer jokes and everything, I really was convinced it was going to be before the financial year was over, they would release this.

122
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm willing to admit I got that one wrong, which is a bummer.

123
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, take the time to get it right.

124
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: A good game is a good game, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, all that stuff.

125
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, speaking of that timetable, though, just real quick, I will mention, you

126
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:25,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the original Switch, right?

127
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:31,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the teaser trailer in October, and then the full reveal came three months later in January, right?

128
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:38,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we know, we had the teaser trailer here in June, and then we have the full announcements three months later in April.

129
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,422
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that now because they gave us the date, right?

130
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could, from there, assume maybe that if it went by a similar pattern, it would be two to three months after, and we could be looking at a...

131
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Late June, Early July type of release for this.

132
00:09:56,954 --> 00:10:01,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why that time frame would be desired.

133
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, just saying, it's interesting.

134
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's a couple...

135
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Propositions for that.

136
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:16,561
[SPEAKER_02]: For us in the United States, it's after tax time.

137
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:22,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It is when school is getting out.

138
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:30,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also technically a dead period in the video game release cycle most of the summer from like about...

139
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:36,600
[SPEAKER_02]: May through July, the end of July is essentially a dead period.

140
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So they could have the attention all to themselves essentially.

141
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:45,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the hype around Summer Games Fest type of stuff.

142
00:10:45,806 --> 00:10:48,988
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that might be a reason.

143
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I think it may just still come out fourth quarter.

144
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just may take some extra time to get those pre-orders in.

145
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:04,005
[SPEAKER_02]: But along with the direct, they're going to be doing live kind of early access to it.

146
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:21,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually coinciding with the same time period, you're going to be able to experience the Nintendo Switch starting in New York from April 4th through the 6th at Center 415 in Los Angeles in Television City.

147
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: from April 11th through the 13th and then finally Dallas at the Embarcadero building at Fair Park from April 25th through the 27th and registration is open as of a couple days ago so you'll need to go register on Nintendo's website nintendo.com slash us nintendo-switch-2-experience

148
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,010
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested.

149
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:25,529
[SPEAKER_03]: and judging on the places that they are setting all these things up it seems to be they're all indoors and I would assume these are more like traveling E3 type of booths but maybe it's something where you move room to room I find the location of Television City in LA that's where they used to do the Price is Right

150
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:46,483
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's that kind of building uh but you know well empty studios are giant rooms that are meant to be reconfigured over and over so like on that you know front I'm like okay yeah that makes sense it's just it's just it's more of a fun fact that oh this is where they used to do the prices right but I think they moved it uh only like a couple years ago but anyway

151
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:51,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The New York location, the Dallas... It was Dallas, not Houston, right?

152
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:55,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Those locations are also big indoor spaces, it seems like.

153
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:05,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder if they are setting it up as some sort of... Maybe you go from room to room and you'll see the various launch games and you'll get a chance to do hands-on with each launch game.

154
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:06,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

155
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Because originally when...

156
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,581
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

157
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:33,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to know about how long the experience is going to take and that they have everything on tight windows.

158
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:48,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of go, maybe they are doing something a little more structured that's intended to move people through in a reasonable amount of time and that they know what that capacity is so that they don't have giant lines on lines and crowd control situations.

159
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:51,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like it might be an interesting event.

160
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm willing to go to LA.

161
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:54,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

162
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:56,092
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot.

163
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention a few things that were confirmed.

164
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, backwards compatibility is confirmed.

165
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:08,644
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they do have the caveat of some titles may not be compatible.

166
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,205
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little weird.

167
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:15,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not necessarily... Well, they announced the backwards compatibility thing a few months ago.

168
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:17,908
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem was they didn't announce the Kavat until now.

169
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:32,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the caveat there is essentially that it's probably more along the lines of stuff that requires the Nintendo Switch controller to be used in certain ways, like Labo, for example.

170
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,226
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Joy-Cons are not going to fit Labo.

171
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:37,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, I gotcha.

172
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:40,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, that, I think that's what that's about.

173
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they go image abandon Labo?

174
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:48,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's like other things that may have that kind of things and they kind of have to point that stuff out just in case.

175
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:54,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, legally when they make a claim like that, they want to avoid anything, you know, even if, yeah, you're right for the most part.

176
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:59,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never know, somebody might have built the 3D, the 3D glasses thing in Labo is kind of cute.

177
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody might want to try that on their Switch 2 and then they'll realize, oh, not only is the Switch 2 system too big to actually fit the specs, the old one, but then the controllers and da-da-da-da-da.

178
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also surprised how black the controllers are.

179
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas they are kind of the red and blue, it's mostly black.

180
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:22,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if we'll see more variations on that probably later on down the road.

181
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:23,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we will.

182
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:25,589
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

183
00:15:45,270 --> 00:16:11,264
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the way my Switch is but yeah I mean they could release controllers and I'm sure they will that are Zelda themed Pokemon themed is like a guarantee that'll have you know different things for whenever Gen 10 or maybe Legends Z to A is announced but I'm very curious to see how some of these games now I'm thinking maybe at that LA event they'll have Pokemon Legends Z to A dang maybe I should register just see if I get it or not

184
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:14,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, essentially it could be coming out in a few months.

185
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.

186
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:17,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.

187
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:20,058
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long drive.

188
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a long drive, but I could, you know, I can make a weekend of it and be like, oh, I'll go see Victoria.

189
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have not been to Mario Land, which is not that far.

190
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Universal Studios and all that is all relatively in the same area.

191
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all north of downtown.

192
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to go.

193
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:35,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

194
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

195
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: S200 Matt says, yeah, isn't there a Pokemon event coming up where they're going to show off Z-Day?

196
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,986
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a Pokemon thing at the end of February.

197
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's the anniversary of Pokemon, but it marks some sort of event.

198
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:52,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's expected we will see more Pokemon Legends footage soon.

199
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expected.

200
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:58,136
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean we'll get it, but it's expected we're going to see more of that towards the end of February.

201
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:00,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that.

202
00:17:01,217 --> 00:17:03,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, Pokemon obviously has all these other things are doing well.

203
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,900
[SPEAKER_03]: The trading card pocket game, which I think we have a story on later.

204
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, the trading card game itself.

205
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:11,082
[SPEAKER_03]: My goodness.

206
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:14,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen these videos of people fighting at Costco over trade?

207
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's Black Friday or something, but it's these Pokemon trading card releases.

208
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:25,830
[SPEAKER_03]: and they roll out the pallet at Costco and grown men fighting each other over these things so they can sell them on eBay.

209
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so silly.

210
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:27,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

211
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

212
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

213
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:28,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

214
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:29,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

215
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:35,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that was one of the last videos I saw on TikTok before it hit the shitter.

216
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know it's back.

217
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all think I'm never on the internet.

218
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's back.

219
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:44,523
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just, you know, obviously we were down for a little bit.

220
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:50,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, do you know, legit, hand to God, do you know what the last video was I saw on TikTok?

221
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember they pulled it early, like two hours ago?

222
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two hours, not two hours ago, two hours before it was supposed to.

223
00:17:55,851 --> 00:18:00,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand to God, the last thing that came up on my algorithm before that pop-up that said, sorry, we're going dark, came up.

224
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of DarkSakura's Dead by Daylight.

225
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:05,034
[SPEAKER_08]: really?

226
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:05,975
[SPEAKER_03]: which one?

227
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:31,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember retrospect now because I was too flustered at the closure you were on Ormond or the new one or something oh probably one of the pet the dog ones oh it might have been but yeah it did crack me up I was like oh legit Jamie's talk is the last thing I see before it all goes to hell so anyway Loki what else on the Switch 2?

228
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:32,294
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else?

229
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart looks cool.

230
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been speculating, obviously, just based off of what little footage in there.

231
00:18:41,192 --> 00:18:41,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We love that.

232
00:18:42,874 --> 00:18:46,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, the first thing I noticed was the tracks look huge.

233
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just at least the one that they showed off, it looks absolutely much larger than normal stuff.

234
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:59,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And going along with that, people have spotted that there are 24 starting line positions for

235
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:06,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Alluding to 24 players, maybe, which is a lot more than what we get right now.

236
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that like double, I think?

237
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:10,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't know what it's up to if it's 12 or I think it's 12.

238
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:12,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is 12.

239
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:16,876
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think when you're all playing on one console, I don't think you can have more than eight on one console.

240
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:23,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember something about the Bluetooth noise wouldn't handle more than eight for any game.

241
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:52,876
[SPEAKER_03]: which you know because my my first instinct was like oh I wonder if you're I wonder if you'll be able to have just like fucking massive amounts of Mario Kart players in one room you know all play and then I was like wait a minute I think there was a thing with like Bluetooth noise and they they actually had to limit it at eight uh because of that issue now who know maybe you know technology's come a long way since the original Switch maybe they found a way to reduce the noise but I I don't know how much stock I put on that so it seems to indicate there will definitely be some type of like online sort of functionality

242
00:19:53,496 --> 00:20:00,903
[SPEAKER_03]: and it definitely indicates we better be getting Baby Park with 24 racers on it.

243
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:04,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I need Baby Park with 24 racers on it.

244
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be so ridiculous.

245
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait.

246
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole reason to play a game like that.

247
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Baby Park should have been the track they showed.

248
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:18,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Class says, could the new Mario Kart have tracks based on the movie?

249
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, it could.

250
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:37,685
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I well there have already been people you know again going down the rabbit hole that Donkey Kong looks more like movie Donkey Kong than he does you know original so sure I mean why not and I'm not I'm not saying that to be sarcastic so yeah why why not do the

251
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:38,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, too.

252
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, folks, these games have been in development for a while.

253
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:53,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of that stuff, the movie stuff, could have been based off of the designs that they had already for the actual games and characters.

254
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:57,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be that the game actually did inform the movie.

255
00:20:57,175 --> 00:21:00,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe the Mario Brothers movie was secretly a Mario Kart Direct the whole time.

256
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:02,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

257
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:04,179
[SPEAKER_02]: We down.

258
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:04,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We down.

259
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get some Mad Max carts in there.

260
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

261
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mario Kart is such a good fucking game to launch a system with, though.

262
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:16,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, it's one of Nintendo's best games.

263
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:24,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that there's a lot going on here that Nintendo is just admitting, this is what works.

264
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just do it.

265
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the console itself, even just calling it Nintendo Switch 2, which I do believe is the final name.

266
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:35,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby and I were having a little bit of a riff because he was saying he doesn't...

267
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,646
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's saying he doesn't think it's the final name.

268
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, eh, it's in the press release.

269
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:42,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be fair, if you scrape the trademark database, it doesn't come up yet.

270
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:43,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a slow process.

271
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,308
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that's the name.

272
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And why not?

273
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a surprising amount of discourse over the name, but I'm like, it works for PlayStation.

274
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

275
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,911
[SPEAKER_03]: for iPhones and Pixels.

276
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:56,112
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for everything else.

277
00:21:56,272 --> 00:22:02,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that Nintendo is leaning into just what works and giving us more of it.

278
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think this is what people have wanted for a long time.

279
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,842
[SPEAKER_03]: They want Mario in 4K.

280
00:22:07,882 --> 00:22:09,983
[SPEAKER_03]: They want Mario Kart in 4K.

281
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:16,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mario Kart is Nintendo's biggest, Mario Kart 8 anyway, has been Nintendo's biggest game of like the last 10 years.

282
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:20,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, of course, this is a great fucking idea to launch a console with it.

283
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:24,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and what's funny, though, is, like, people are already judging it.

284
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:26,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Their logo's just too much the same.

285
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we don't even know how any of this functions right now.

286
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:30,733
[SPEAKER_02]: You just know what it looks like.

287
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:32,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm disappointed.

288
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:33,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, well, too bad.

289
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:34,816
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares.

290
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:39,660
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares that you're disappointed by pictures in a trailer.

291
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:41,650
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

292
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy one.

293
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy one.

294
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:45,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave some for the rest of us.

295
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are going on the internet saying Mario Kart looks too samesy, you know what?

296
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:51,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Do us all a favor.

297
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,019
[SPEAKER_03]: All a favor.

298
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't buy one.

299
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

300
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:59,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then there will be more for the rest of us to pre-order and have our hands on.

301
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:05,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hoping this long lead time and all of these hardware releases and all this stuff...

302
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,492
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:28,874
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, we'll see.

304
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:37,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't know until they really unveil the curtain on it because you can't trust leakers and all of that stuff.

305
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, the Mario Kart game looks sweet.

306
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,815
[SPEAKER_03]: What have the rumors also been saying?

307
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:48,357
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of third-party stuff that's been confirmed, right?

308
00:23:48,397 --> 00:23:55,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Like things that were on PS4 and PS5 that skipped the original Switch probably because of lack of power, right?

309
00:23:55,821 --> 00:24:00,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the Star Wars games have been rumored for Switch 2, right?

310
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:02,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard anything.

311
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,586
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be a No Man's Sky update.

312
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:07,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be shocked.

313
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:12,074
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's not a No Man's Sky release for Switch 2 that leans into everything.

314
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:17,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just a backwards compatible, but like an actual Switch 2 release that leans into the power of that console.

315
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be absolutely shocked if they don't have something like that.

316
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

317
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:21,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just excited for it.

318
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to finally be excited for...

319
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: some things like I don't know it's just like like I'm so sick of the overanalyze I mean this is what we do but like I'm so sick of like the overanalyzing everything from like a two minute trailer people like already saying oh I'm disappointed like what is it that you wanted like what what possible thing I don't know it's just it's just silly but I hope there's good games and I hope it's a good launch

320
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:53,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Coffee in chat, I love this, says, Internet pre-Switch announcement.

321
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:58,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We want Nintendo stuff in 4K, Internet after Switch trailer.

322
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't Nintendo do crazy stuff like Wii U?

323
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,061
[SPEAKER_03]: The Internet doesn't know what it wants.

324
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:03,862
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's happy.

325
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:06,442
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Internet?

326
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:08,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No one is ever satisfied?

327
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:08,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you sure?

328
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,784
[SPEAKER_04]: The point of the Internet is to not be happy.

329
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:18,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a few of us are allowed to be happy and we're in the corner with the possum memes.

330
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called doom scrolling, not happy scrolling.

331
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:22,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, folks.

332
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: With the state of the world that it's in...

333
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:37,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take just a plain, you know, new Nintendo console with no frills and just, it's just better than the last one.

334
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:39,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is what I want.

335
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yes, do it.

336
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm fine because they already said they're keeping Nintendo Switch Online, right?

337
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's already been something they've confirmed, right?

338
00:25:46,757 --> 00:25:48,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Switch Online is still going to be a thing here.

339
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:50,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it's backwards compatible, it has to be.

340
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that library would just move over.

341
00:25:52,981 --> 00:25:57,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am A-OK with that because it means they're not going to drip feed all this shit again.

342
00:25:57,563 --> 00:26:06,468
[SPEAKER_03]: They either have to add new things or, well, maybe they just have to add new things such as DS games that maybe you can play vertical.

343
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:07,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii games.

344
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah.

345
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Psych truck.

346
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,331
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCube games.

347
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:12,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

348
00:26:13,012 --> 00:26:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see.

349
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:14,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, you know.

350
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:39,606
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll have to just wait until April and that's just the way it's going to be we have to wait until early April to find out more but then literally the week after they show that people are going to be getting their hands on it at these different events fifth dream physical Switch cards will fit it is backwards compatible with the cartridges it's just there's going to be some games that are Switch 2 only games yes

351
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a CD and a DVD.

352
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:48,484
[SPEAKER_03]: The DVD drive will still read the CDs, but there's also DVDs that will only work not on a CD drive.

353
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,465
[SPEAKER_03]: There, I made a reference for you, 30 and 40-somethings.

354
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:53,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

355
00:26:55,327 --> 00:27:07,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else I kind of wanted to say about all this, which I am assuming here, but I think it is safe to do so, that you're going to have a similar infrastructure with eShop and all that so that your digital library...

356
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:14,614
[SPEAKER_03]: which for some of us is pretty big, should come right over to Switch 2 and Switch 2 should have more memory so you can have more of it.

357
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:19,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just hope that they do a better job of their online store with the new one.

358
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so did you hear this?

359
00:27:21,835 --> 00:27:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Bobby went over this on his show, but I saw this same thing on Blue Sky.

360
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:30,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of our people that hang out here on VOG, it was OrangeRite that did this, right?

361
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeRite or was it QuestBuster?

362
00:27:33,072 --> 00:27:33,673
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

363
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:44,864
[SPEAKER_03]: created their better eShop.

364
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:48,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they did was that they... And they said, we made it in a week.

365
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,829
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a better eShop, and we did it in a week.

366
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:02,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was that they've labeled all these games, categorized them, but they've labeled... They're like, we're trying to thin out the shovelware.

367
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:03,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it was orange, right?

368
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:03,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

369
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:04,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

370
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:05,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

371
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:06,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And then repost it.

372
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:09,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But your bleat is how I saw it, okay?

373
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:15,207
[SPEAKER_03]: So they labeled a bunch of games based on what they've reviewed and so forth.

374
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:19,709
[SPEAKER_03]: But they said they're trying to cut down on the amount of shovelware that's on the platform.

375
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:23,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is Nintendo eShop's worst problem is the amount of shovelware on it.

376
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is they kind of classified everything by default as shovelware.

377
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:35,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go into the shovelware category, it's like all of these games that aren't necessarily bad.

378
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, as Bobby pointed out, I saw one that Orange Rite had highlighted that kind of ticked me off because I know the person that made it.

379
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:46,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, uh, that's not shovelware.

380
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow Up, you know, type of thing.

381
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:56,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And to Orange Wright's credit, he was highlighting, I think he was doing like highlighting these games that should be, or should not be shovelware.

382
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,038
[SPEAKER_03]: They are actually decent games.

383
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember he pulled out Pix the Cat, which was a decent place.

384
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:02,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't call that shovelware.

385
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:09,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a decent indie Pac-Man inspired early PlayStation title, PS4 type title.

386
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all these games that are just called shovelware, which is a bunch of bull.

387
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,503
[SPEAKER_03]: because these games are not shoveled.

388
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,325
[SPEAKER_03]: They are uncategorized games.

389
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:22,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You have not had the time to go in and properly categorize them, so you're throwing them all in as shovelware.

390
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby pointed out there was a P-Cross game in there.

391
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,878
[SPEAKER_03]: One of Nintendo's own franchises is shovelware?

392
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:43,327
[SPEAKER_03]: grow up as a complete... I'm sorry because I know it seems like it's such a small thing, but to the people that work very hard on developing their games and doing all this stuff, this shows why a lot of this shit is harder than you think.

393
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're up there going, look at us, we did it better in a week.

394
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

395
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:53,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for a lot of people, you did it a lot worse by doing them a disservice by calling it shovelware.

396
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And that whole idea was extremely immature.

397
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: and I realize it's the internet there's a lot of immature shit on the internet but if you want to be taken seriously by the big boys like Nintendo you need to act like a grown up and calling all these things shovelware is not acting like a grown up and I might be sounding like a bitch right now but guess what when Nintendo stops sending you advanced copies of things when you act like a bitch you deserve to be bitched how about that that

398
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:27,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to her.

399
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:52,595
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a categorized fuck you?

400
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: and there would be a lot of indie developers that would say that Deft in chat says they did it unintentionally but at the same time they totally did a disservice to all the indie devs out there who put out legit and fun stuff just because they wanted to push it ASAP without actually curating the thing ding ding ding gold star comment that's it that's the problem

401
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:40,561
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, again, is it really a better eShop when you are just poo-pooing away these indie games?

402
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:45,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And were there, yeah, there's like 8,000 games in that shovelware.

403
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Are some of them actually shovelware?

404
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

405
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:49,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure they are.

406
00:31:50,017 --> 00:32:06,479
[SPEAKER_03]: but guess what not all of them and you're doing a huge disservice to the ones that aren't and I'm okay I am okay I will say this they had a category for like asset flip or something like that which were just games that very clearly just flipped assets in the Unity store and did that whole thing I am

407
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,547
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more okay with that.

408
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:17,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I do still hope there is some curation there because just because somebody bought a pre-done pack of texture pack thing doesn't make the game bad.

409
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:19,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use an example here.

410
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used to talk a lot about an AR game, not by Niantic, called Orna, right?

411
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,738
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember when we used to talk about that game a lot?

412
00:32:26,859 --> 00:32:31,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Orna is an AR game and it's like an 8-bit or maybe 16-bit RPG, but it's in the real world.

413
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go out and do that.

414
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:37,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And they put out an offline version of Orna called Aetheric or something like that.

415
00:32:38,447 --> 00:32:46,016
[SPEAKER_03]: That uses like a sprite pack that you can buy in one of those things, you know, and they made it and you'll see those same sprites in other games.

416
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:52,405
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because they had to use a pack to get it doesn't make the game bad by nature.

417
00:32:54,215 --> 00:33:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: something else to consider and I don't know to what extent you know again because I'm not claiming to have the better eShop or whatever I'm not going through and categorizing I don't know what extent they have but I really hope they haven't categorized things as asset flips that are actually relatively original ideas that just yeah they the person that wanted to make their game was not an artist so they they used pre-done packs I don't think that's a big deal

418
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:21,689
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as the game's innovative.

419
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:22,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Some artists got paid for it.

420
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

421
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,630
[SPEAKER_03]: The artists who made it.

422
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it was through official stores and not AI.

423
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the label y'all need to have.

424
00:33:32,172 --> 00:33:33,792
[SPEAKER_03]: AI art.

425
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the label we gotta look out for in the future.

426
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on Switch 2?

427
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've got a lot of tangents, but hey, it's a big story this week.

428
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:45,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks cool.

429
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to wait for more information.

430
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

431
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:38,831
[SPEAKER_03]: If it runs original Switch games better, and I'm not expecting that to happen, although I am kind of hoping.

432
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm crossing my fingers on my toes.

433
00:34:40,632 --> 00:34:43,873
[SPEAKER_03]: If it runs original Switch games better, that's all I need.

434
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my three games right there.

435
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:47,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll buy it just to play...

436
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:52,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Last Generation's Pokemon games, Scarlet Vite, just to play those a little better with a little bit enhanced performance.

437
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That right there makes Switch 2 a must-have.

438
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Legends, same thing.

439
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,642
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm so fucking there for Legends Z to A. I already know, like, it's fine.

440
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I already know.

441
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:06,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart, Legends Z A, Metroid Prime 4.

442
00:35:07,025 --> 00:35:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Say less.

443
00:35:07,545 --> 00:35:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen enough.

444
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:08,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm buying it.

445
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:12,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I need.

446
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:17,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, these are literally all more of the same, and I'm fine with it.

447
00:35:17,472 --> 00:35:24,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will show love to the indies, too, as those games pop up and show up on my radar, as always.

448
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

449
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Deft agrees with me in chat.

450
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

451
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,562
[SPEAKER_03]: If Pokemon Scarlet Violet runs way better and smoother, day one.

452
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:33,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

453
00:35:33,222 --> 00:35:34,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you need.

454
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:35,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really all you need.

455
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Run the Switch games better.

456
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:37,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

457
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:38,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Done and done.

458
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

459
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on and talk about the types.

460
00:35:42,087 --> 00:35:43,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'd get a good Dead by Daylight.

461
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:50,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't see why Dead by Daylight wouldn't release a Switch 2 tuned version.

462
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:54,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of jokes on Twitch and the Twitch community.

463
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've heard these or made these too about when you have a killer.

464
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,291
[SPEAKER_04]: You're playing on Switch.

465
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:58,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

466
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:00,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just you're playing on Switch.

467
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: You're playing on Switch on the McDonald's Wi-Fi.

468
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where some killers... I have actually seen Hex Switch Player.

469
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:10,926
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

470
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:15,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Except you can't make that your name on the Switch.

471
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:16,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could.

472
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: You can name your me.

473
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can rename your account on the Switch.

474
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:23,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never thought I don't have Dead by Daylight on the Switch.

475
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:32,882
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of those games, with as much as I buy certain games over and over, that's one of the games I don't necessarily feel You can have other profiles on your account too.

476
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:34,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good thought.

477
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:35,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, true.

478
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:36,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

479
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:42,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well speaking of Dead by Daylight, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing this week.

480
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:44,047
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

481
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight.

482
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be playing more Dead by Daylight tonight.

483
00:36:50,208 --> 00:37:00,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on Thursday, instead of playing Dead by Daylight, Shayla and I had a complete two-person vote and we decided to play Palia because fuck Dead by Daylight for a minute.

484
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I saw your Palia thing, yeah.

485
00:37:03,141 --> 00:37:05,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It got kind of toxic.

486
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:08,063
[SPEAKER_04]: People were being shitty, so we were just like, we're not going to deal with it.

487
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:12,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Dragon Age The Veil Guard, of course.

488
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on my second playthrough.

489
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:23,748
[SPEAKER_04]: I am trying to do everything I did not do my first playthrough, like the things that I kind of sped through parts of the game and missed, so I'm getting that done.

490
00:37:24,588 --> 00:37:28,810
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this cool scene where you just go grocery shopping with Lucanus, and I love it.

491
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very charming.

492
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I also played a little Bellatro today.

493
00:37:37,202 --> 00:37:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not addicted to it, no matter what people like to tease about.

494
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:50,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I play the game like maybe on Sunday for an hour while I'm watching YouTube videos with Dan, which is literally what happened today.

495
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:57,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I am playing Fruit Mountain, which I'm still kind of hooked on.

496
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I am playing Moonlight Mahjong, just because it's my stress relief game.

497
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:04,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm actually gonna label, name the stuff I've been playing, like, for real.

498
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:11,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also been playing, uh, uh, the, uh, Suika game a bit.

499
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:16,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, I just really, it's relaxing and frustrating at the same time.

500
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I am...

501
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:47,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on I was telling Loki about this earlier I'm going to finally finish up my project management thing and get into a Unity course to actually check on Unity and Swift integration to make nothing but UI stuff, UI UX stuff to practice for a position I want to apply for at work and

502
00:38:49,837 --> 00:39:13,933
[SPEAKER_04]: just like I'm actually and I even have a visual novel designer but I'm working my comic as a visual novel style basically it's just going to be animated and autoplayed I've got stuff in line I've got things going on but those are most of what I've been playing

503
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:41,548
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm still trying to I went looking to buy a game specifically and it's way out of my budget but I've been looking for a copy of Vibripple affordably now I did buy a Japanese Umjamur Lami which should be on its way so I can play in hell I'm on this Nana Onsha kick

504
00:39:43,042 --> 00:40:07,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just been watching Mojibribbon and Parappa playthroughs and Parappa remixes I don't even know how that happened, but it happened and I'm just sort of going with it I'm glad I'm not the only person in this universe that has trouble on Cheep Cheep's level

505
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:36,436
[SPEAKER_03]: um you know talking about getting new games makes me think you know um Alan and I are sort of lightly starting to explore this idea so I don't know if you know this DarkSakura but um we actually uh so when we it was a couple years ago DarkSakura actually gave us old couches an old couch and an old love seat that her and Dan had I'm sad to say those finally went to couch heaven they'd seen better years they were they were they were they were past their prime um so we actually replaced with they were really comfortable though when we got them

506
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:42,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just, you know, over the years, they started to, you could, like, feel the metal, and it was like, oh, okay, it's time to get stuff.

507
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:44,299
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been pretty fortunate with our day jobs and stuff.

508
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the decision to buy those was the nap test.

509
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,401
Yeah.

510
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:50,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally took a nap in the store.

511
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:52,022
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they served us.

512
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And because... Yeah.

513
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:54,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

514
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:56,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, they served us well, and we're thankful.

515
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:57,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

516
00:40:58,865 --> 00:40:59,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

517
00:40:59,305 --> 00:41:00,406
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Well, um...

518
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:03,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say about the purchasing.

519
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:06,606
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought a new couch and all that.

520
00:41:06,646 --> 00:41:11,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have like an L-shaped one for our house now to kind of fit the room and all that.

521
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:17,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may have snuck a picture of it because there's a picture of Cheddar I think that Alan put up that's actually on the new furniture.

522
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:20,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, but we also, we didn't just get rid of that.

523
00:41:20,797 --> 00:41:23,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of an old recliner that I had for my parents.

524
00:41:23,098 --> 00:41:25,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of the coffee table that just didn't seem better years.

525
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:29,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of a futon that we had that was upstairs and kind of seemed better.

526
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We purged a lot of stuff and actually felt really good.

527
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:38,626
[SPEAKER_03]: But now because we have all that space downstairs, we're thinking about getting a new coffee table.

528
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:46,688
[SPEAKER_03]: But this has gone to, should we be those people and get a cocktail cabinet table?

529
00:41:47,268 --> 00:42:00,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically maybe one of those built... I was actually thinking what Bobby Blackwolf has in his basement, how he has the custom machine and the custom pinball thing, but maybe a custom...

530
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,051
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

531
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:36,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's my long winded way of saying you were talking about like what the buy games, I'm, we're thinking about picking up a piece of furniture like that.

532
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:42,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably won't be right away because we've, we, you know, we spend enough money on the furniture, but maybe after a few months we save some more money, maybe something like that.

533
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to have you keep some things in mind.

534
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm hmm.

535
00:42:48,580 --> 00:43:16,765
[SPEAKER_04]: maintenance cost and will you be able to use storage as well so those are the things we had talked about getting a coffee table I mean right now it's not going to work with all the stuff that we have that we're organizing but I was more thinking of having one of those lift top ones and making it a board gaming table with like a removable area for dice rolling and stuff like that

536
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:18,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

537
00:43:42,697 --> 00:44:08,055
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually because we don't really need the kitchen table that we have currently that's also very very old our kitchen tables you've had that one for like ever uh-huh and that's that's like actually we probably would have gotten rid of that too if we hadn't like filled up the junk hauler with all this other crap because we got we had so much other like just like giant arcade one-up boxes we hadn't been able to break it can't fit in our face it's just like things that just needed to go it felt really good to purge all that stuff so

538
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:10,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we were on gateways.

539
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the middle of the office purge.

540
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, but I have to say, I found things doing my office purge.

541
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I found Famicom games.

542
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, nice.

543
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I found a WaterSwan game.

544
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,941
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, what game?

545
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:24,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy 2.

546
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:25,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

547
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

548
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:27,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

549
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:52,135
[SPEAKER_04]: where did i and then like and then like i remember oh yeah i bought this here and like stuff that i picked up at like twitch con and i found a lanyard of disneyland pins and the big pin on the bottom of it said it's i'm celebrating and it says my guinness world record oh you went that recently

550
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:55,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It was after TwitchCon.

551
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.

552
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:57,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

553
00:44:58,052 --> 00:44:59,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that would have been after all that.

554
00:44:59,233 --> 00:44:59,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

555
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:01,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was that one.

556
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:03,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, ah!

557
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:04,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, yeah, put this aside.

558
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to laminate it so that the stuff doesn't wear off.

559
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:08,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

560
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:09,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

561
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we were in Gaming Week, so I'm sorry.

562
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:14,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the one who derailed that.

563
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:15,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you have anything else here in Gaming Week, DarkSakura?

564
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:19,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.

565
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, then Loki, how was your Gaming Week?

566
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:49,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working just basically trying to get the water ride done in my theme park and it is working I don't want to say done I keep like nothing is ever done I have more art assets I have to make but functionally it works and it is done it just needs I've been polishing this thing for like months now but it is improving

567
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be very impressive.

568
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:55,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that I've shown it to has been blown away by what it is.

569
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:59,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It is essentially a theme park ride.

570
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:06,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like you went to Disneyland and rode a splash mountain or something like that.

571
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

572
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: The owner of the lumber mill is this beaver guy named Doug Beaverton.

573
00:46:36,742 --> 00:46:47,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I was channeling Doug Dimmadome from the Fairly Oddparents for this character, so he essentially found that you can mix, like,

574
00:46:48,393 --> 00:47:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: TreeSap and Honey and possibly bees to make an energy drink and then these raccoons got into that energy drink and now they're bouncing all over the place and so making a mess of things and you have to essentially tranquilize them with darts to um

575
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:08,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stop them from destroying the place.

576
00:47:09,011 --> 00:47:35,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the whole ride goes through, like, the outside of the lumber mill, through the lumber mill, up the mountain, through some caves, and then into this raccoon city that's inside of, not really raccoon city, gotta call it raccoon town because everybody gets confused with raccoon city and Resident Evil, but it goes through this, like, shanty town inside of there, and it's just kind of this whole story that goes along through there, and that Doug Beaverton character is

577
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:43,869
[SPEAKER_02]: as an animatronic throughout the ride, like kind of making weird comments about things and funny quotes and stuff.

578
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:48,931
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, I don't know, it feels like an actual water ride.

579
00:47:48,971 --> 00:48:00,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And mixing some of the mods that we had to allow for custom audio and that type of thing and custom models that I've made in the game, it really just...

580
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:01,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Sells it.

581
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:03,633
[SPEAKER_02]: The vibes are there for it.

582
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:19,525
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think once it gets in the video, which will be soon, I was originally going to put this out and then do another video for the rest of the park, but I am just at this point just trying to get everything done because we have our world tour day, which is essentially on the 8th.

583
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

584
00:48:22,677 --> 00:48:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: so everything has to be done by then so I was doing the Wild West area today and finishing that up that wasn't quite finished because the guy that was helping me with that he started it and it's like half done so I have to finish all that but it's

585
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:38,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.

586
00:48:38,754 --> 00:48:39,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say.

587
00:48:39,415 --> 00:48:42,157
[SPEAKER_02]: The video will be coming out hopefully soon.

588
00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:44,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's just lots of stuff.

589
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,102
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it unrelated to Minecraft right now.

590
00:48:47,122 --> 00:48:54,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to create a lot of custom assets like billboards and stuff and signs and everything and Photoshop and all that.

591
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

592
00:48:57,162 --> 00:49:09,589
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna, I think it's something that no one's ever done before to this level and it's a water ride too which I've never seen that done in Minecraft and it's funny though, the guy that inspired me this

593
00:49:10,896 --> 00:49:11,136
[SPEAKER_02]: DINGYFREED

594
00:49:29,455 --> 00:49:52,249
[SPEAKER_02]: in the functionality of it and everything and all the redstone behind it actually tracks the score up to 10 boats at a time so you can have 10 riders on which is the maximum that can fit in the ride at any given time and it will track their scores individually as it goes through the ride and then display it at the end on this three digit seven segment display it's just crazy yeah

595
00:49:53,757 --> 00:50:04,729
[SPEAKER_02]: so look forward to that soon and I'll let everybody know but I am so glad to be done with that part but still not I'll be even more relieved when everything is done

596
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:07,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

597
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:10,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if that's it, let's see my gaming week.

598
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:13,350
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the usual stuff that I play.

599
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,110
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft.

600
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a second character to level 80.

601
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:18,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, I have a disc priest now at 80 as well as a holy pally.

602
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:19,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I love healers.

603
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:22,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, there's that.

604
00:50:22,274 --> 00:50:24,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I even played a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV again.

605
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:28,717
[SPEAKER_03]: It had actually been a while since I played, but somebody asked me to play and I was like, sure, I'll come play for a little bit.

606
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, juggling two MMOs is very hard.

607
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably will let WoW go when there's something kind of...

608
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,080
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

609
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:02,029
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

610
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:26,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was playing the original, or I should say the NES version, not the original, but the NES version, this custom ROM of Pac-Man Championship Edition.

611
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember playing that in one of the Pac-Man, I think it was in that most recent Pac-Man collection that came out on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, all that stuff.

612
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually did a demake of Pac-Man Championship Edition, and it's actually really good.

613
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:40,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

614
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:42,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that ROM's been fun to play.

615
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually was, part of what kind of...

616
00:51:47,122 --> 00:52:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: spawned that whole thing is I was randomly playing Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 which is a game that's a few years old at this point but I was randomly playing that game on my Steam Deck because you know I'm like visiting things on my Steam Deck uh just you know that play well and yeah I was like oh this game is still kind of fun like I know it wasn't received super well because the ghosts on rails mechanic kind of is weird I kind of I do understand why they did it but it does make the game a little difficult sometimes but um yeah I've been enjoying it so yeah

617
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it for my game of the week.

618
00:52:17,486 --> 00:52:22,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So, alright, with that, we will move on into other stories going on tonight.

619
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's get into it.

620
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:28,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what's going on at Sony's?

621
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:31,149
[SPEAKER_02]: More cancelled live service games.

622
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:42,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these, I mean, I don't know if we really knew a lot of these were coming, because they don't sound good, but they've been cancelled, so I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

623
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So, apparently...

624
00:52:46,195 --> 00:53:07,848
[SPEAKER_02]: the uh there was a couple games canceled by Ben Studios and Bluepoint Games according to a report by Bloomberg and these the two projects that they were working on were these online live service games one of them was a live service spinoff of the God of War franchise you um and

625
00:53:09,584 --> 00:53:11,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they put the name on it to sell it.

626
00:53:11,386 --> 00:53:16,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, that's... It would have been just... To guarantee sales, they put God of War's name on it.

627
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:17,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

628
00:53:18,673 --> 00:53:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

629
00:53:19,874 --> 00:53:30,003
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, you know, Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studio families and we're working closely with each studio to determine what the next projects are.

630
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:32,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And then apparently...

631
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:33,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

632
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:38,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't know what the other game was, but of course, you know, Ben Studios had done Days Gone before.

633
00:53:38,706 --> 00:53:47,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's maybe a spinoff of that, but I guess they learned their lesson with Concord, maybe?

634
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're kind of pulling back a little bit.

635
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:52,131
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

636
00:53:52,512 --> 00:53:53,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but...

637
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:57,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a mistake to go all in on live service games.

638
00:53:57,671 --> 00:54:00,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was... I know that's tempting, but... Definitely an error on their part.

639
00:54:00,632 --> 00:54:02,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not all live service games are terrible.

640
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:05,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Diablo 4 as a live service game.

641
00:54:05,955 --> 00:54:06,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy it.

642
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,398
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's other games that, you know, and some people enjoy Destiny, or at least used to.

643
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, you know, there's other things that people really enjoy.

644
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:21,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel Rivals is a live service game that a lot of people are playing lately.

645
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's...

646
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: There are good ones out there that people enjoy, but it's just their whole idea to flood the market.

647
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's got to be live service.

648
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:29,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a poor decision.

649
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:31,328
[SPEAKER_03]: The God of War game might have been decent.

650
00:54:32,409 --> 00:54:36,751
[SPEAKER_03]: We might actually be looking at a case of, unfortunately, it's the reverse.

651
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:41,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Now because this game did poorly, this game that might have been alright got thrown out as well.

652
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:43,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a bummer.

653
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:43,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been okay.

654
00:54:45,100 --> 00:55:03,749
[SPEAKER_02]: so apparently according to screenshots that were DMCA'd taken down from the website that was reporting that the Ben Studio game that they were working on looked like it was a military shooter game so like a Call of Duty or something like that alright, sure

655
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:15,642
[SPEAKER_03]: On a somewhat related note, I've been seeing this headline going around talking about the game industry would love Grand Theft Auto 6 to cost $100.

656
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:19,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

657
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, it's...

658
00:55:39,554 --> 00:55:41,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Online, they make billions of dollars.

659
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:43,980
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why they haven't made a new Grand Theft Auto game until now.

660
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, honestly, the whole argument that, like, well, games aren't profitable anymore, and so we have to raise the price, you know, it's like, well...

661
00:55:52,270 --> 00:56:08,027
[SPEAKER_02]: No, see, because when I bought a game, let's just say an $80 game back on the Super Nintendo or something like that, that's not the same as a $70 game that's coming out now, but then a $30 season pass, and then more microtransactions on top of that.

662
00:56:08,147 --> 00:56:11,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the Super Nintendo game did not have the ability to...

663
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:12,792
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

664
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:34,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Those tapes, the VHS tapes, cost upwards to like $120 a tape.

665
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:42,698
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very expensive because they are selling it for the intent and purpose of rental, and so therefore the price of that is...

666
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they just probably marked it up so they can make a ton of money off of it, but that's what it was for.

667
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:48,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Backing it up.

668
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:58,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that anybody thinks you're lying, but I remember because that first job I had was at a video store, and when customers lost tapes, it blew their fucking mind that, like, yeah, the lost tape fee is, you know, $120.

669
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:58,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, what?

670
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:00,980
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

671
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,064
[SPEAKER_03]: But these tapes are like $20 at Walmart.

672
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:05,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You lost a movie.

673
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:08,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big book that showed all the going prices of everything.

674
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:15,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And some movie, like Jurassic Park, some of the things that were really consumed massively were priced for sale immediately.

675
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:19,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I think something like Jurassic Park was only $20 when it came out.

676
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Every household had that movie.

677
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Most movies were...

678
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: that what you're talking about like rental and sell through is what they called it so rental the movie prices were much higher and then sell through it was basically you know that you could sell it for 20 bucks and that's what the price was so it eventually comes down in price after that rental window or whatever uh that thing changed with like a dvd and uh blu-ray of course but

679
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:52,438
[SPEAKER_02]: The point being, though, is a lot of these higher-priced games, yeah, they may be at a higher price up front, but they're not getting you on the back end with all this stuff.

680
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, like, a $70 game from Rockstar, like, they're not going to have microtransactions.

681
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:03,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They made billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars on Grand Theft Auto Online.

682
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a game that unnecessarily charges you for rent.

683
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: for maintaining your garage.

684
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,516
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't need to be a gameplay element in the game.

685
00:58:11,536 --> 00:58:19,221
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it in there because they're making you grind for this and they're making it so that you want to buy these shark cards because that's where they're making all their money.

686
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I don't, yeah, sure.

687
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:35,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of the industry, probably Ubisoft as well, you know, would love it if the base price could be $100 because then they could just slap, you know, their pirate game that has literally no effort put into it and charge $100 and call it a quintuple A game.

688
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:36,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know,

689
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Be the end of that.

690
00:58:38,935 --> 00:58:40,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Make another $30 on their game.

691
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Grand Theft Auto 6 could probably get away with it.

692
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Final Fantasy 17 could probably get away with it.

693
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:50,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like Mario Kart, quite honestly, could probably get away with it.

694
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:59,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is, you want to complain about lack of innovation in the gaming space, you have these other type of games that would never fetch that kind of money.

695
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:04,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is, the gaming space is competing against, for all those games, you have your $20 Bellatro.

696
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:08,198
[SPEAKER_03]: $5 Vampire Survivors.

697
00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:20,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Games run the gamut of costs now, and I think it is much more important for companies to be able to show that value for what they're asking for up front.

698
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also like this open secret, like

699
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:27,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you all, I never buy Mortal Kombat games at launch anymore.

700
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:27,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I?

701
00:59:28,384 --> 00:59:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're going to cost $70.

702
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:32,046
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to nickel and dime for every character.

703
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:39,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, maybe I'll have to wait two to three years, but eventually there's going to be a version that comes out that's $40 for fucking everything.

704
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:40,590
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the version I'll get.

705
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

706
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we all know that now.

707
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:55,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you have to remember now, like, as the sales charts have shown, and, you know, to the chagrin, I guess, of Sony and stuff, so here's another fun fact here, too.

708
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:56,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fine.

709
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:03,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, all of these companies are charging, like, you know, $70 for their games, because games are too expensive.

710
01:00:04,425 --> 01:00:09,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Mind you, that they are selling the far majority of them on their own...

711
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:12,592
[SPEAKER_02]: own digital platform.

712
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that $70 typically would have a 30% margin built in for the middleman in there.

713
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:24,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have your distributors, you have your retailers, and you have all that stuff at retail.

714
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody makes a little cut of that.

715
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:55,723
[SPEAKER_02]: when you remove all those middlemen they're making even more profit on top of that so don't give me this oh we're poor we can't make anything off of our game so we have to keep raising the price you're making way more margin up front you're making margin on the back end and it's just it's ridiculous all around so I just I don't see the point of them pushing all this stuff and then then then what they do on top of that by the way is that they they add in two bonus cosmetic skins that cost them next to nothing to make that only come when you buy it on their store

716
01:00:56,463 --> 01:01:20,175
[SPEAKER_02]: or they charge you for cosmetic skins that are really just like recolors of stuff here's the thing we we live in a digital marketplace right now where you know before you'd have to pre-order your game because there was a finite number of copies coming out for physical but if you're buying digital there is absolutely no reason to pre-order games anymore and you probably shouldn't because you don't know what state those games are going to come out in and just because some you know

717
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:20,755
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

718
01:01:44,124 --> 01:01:45,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's move on.

719
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:51,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, but I had to bring that because when I, yeah, all that other stuff, I was like, oh, I wonder about that $100 Grand Theft Auto.

720
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:52,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely Loki has an opinion on that.

721
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:53,748
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

722
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:55,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it for $100.

723
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:56,750
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

724
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,671
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, and I'm saying they're not confirming that's the price.

725
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:03,433
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more of a think piece on the industry would love to see this.

726
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:03,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

727
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:06,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically, the base game comes out at $99.99.

728
01:02:06,674 --> 01:02:08,475
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm good.

729
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:15,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee it'll be a $70 game and then they're just going to nickel and dime you to death like they always do.

730
01:02:15,757 --> 01:02:16,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what'll happen.

731
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:17,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

732
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about this.

733
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:21,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

734
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:27,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew this story was going to come up at some point because obviously there's been a lot going on in the world politically.

735
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We know tomorrow is going to be an interesting day.

736
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:32,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just, you know, all I'm going to say is this.

737
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, I'm going to be focusing on Martin Luther King Jr.

738
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:36,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Day.

739
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:55,768
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

740
01:02:56,388 --> 01:03:01,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Find something else to do, whether that's going outside.

741
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:01,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm working.

742
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:03,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting together with friends.

743
01:03:03,131 --> 01:03:03,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Working.

744
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:04,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

745
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:07,292
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you're not part of, you know, in the spirit of Martin Luther King.

746
01:03:07,312 --> 01:03:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting double and a half pay?

747
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:08,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

748
01:03:09,393 --> 01:03:11,234
[SPEAKER_03]: In the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.

749
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:16,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Day, volunteerism is very much encouraged, especially in the Los Angeles area.

750
01:03:16,536 --> 01:03:19,257
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big need for a lot of that right now with everything going on.

751
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:20,278
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

752
01:03:20,358 --> 01:03:24,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I also realize much of the country, we live in a part of the country where you kind of can go outside right now.

753
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:30,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I know much of the country is kind of fucking frozen, but you know, a lot of people are... Air quality is kind of shit up here too.

754
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:30,771
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, that's true.

755
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you know, if you can, just make a plan for something to just...

756
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:45,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Relax, or work or whatever is going to take your mind off it because there's just a lot of negative stuff that's going to continue to be negative.

757
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:47,065
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

758
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but I'm sure unless you've been living under a rock, you know that the TikTok ban actually happened yesterday for about 14 hours.

759
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:01,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, I just want to correct one thing.

760
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's calling it a TikTok ban.

761
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:07,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, the app was never banned.

762
01:04:08,075 --> 01:04:10,396
[SPEAKER_03]: The distribution of the app was banned.

763
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:14,818
[SPEAKER_03]: The servicing of the app from providers within the U.S.

764
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:15,478
[SPEAKER_03]: was banned.

765
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:24,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was never written into it that like, oh, if you use TikTok after it's pulled, you as a consumer are going to be, or this app is, none of that was there.

766
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:26,362
[SPEAKER_03]: This was trying to cut it off at the source.

767
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:39,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why it was interesting that things went the way they did because they actually shut TikTok off before the app stores did anything at midnight, which was when they kind of, you know, all said they were good.

768
01:04:39,623 --> 01:04:47,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, and there's a lot of talk, conspiracy theories, and in my opinion, just a bunch of fucking smoke and mirrors until we have some actual answers.

769
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem with those types of apps is that everybody's free to, well, I think Meta bought them because this and this and this.

770
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:56,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's great that that's what you think.

771
01:04:57,028 --> 01:04:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't make it fact.

772
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get up there and rant as long as you want.

773
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:01,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make it fact.

774
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:04,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have to kind of wait and see those types of things.

775
01:05:04,715 --> 01:05:10,740
[SPEAKER_03]: But TikTok did go down for a few hours, but TikTok took some things with it.

776
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:23,411
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty much everything related to ByteDance, which was Lemonade, which was their other more Instagram, Pinterest-y app, which is interesting because that was the app they were pushing as a TikTok replacement.

777
01:05:23,871 --> 01:05:25,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So that felt very strange to me.

778
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:58,000
[SPEAKER_03]: is involved or was involved with Marvel Snap, but only very lightly.

779
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,361
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the publisher of the game.

780
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding is they are no longer the publisher of the game.

781
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:22,676
[SPEAKER_03]: The development of this game was actually developed by Second Dinner and it was published under Nuverse, which is a ByteDance subsidiary, that this app also disappeared because the game was temporarily unavailable because I'm going to assume ByteDance was still being credited as a publisher and anything that had that company's name on it had to go.

782
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:27,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Xiao Hong Shu is still available from my understanding though.

783
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's that whole thing.

784
01:06:30,702 --> 01:06:31,362
[SPEAKER_03]: The red note?

785
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's red note.

786
01:06:32,803 --> 01:06:34,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I just signed up for that.

787
01:06:34,644 --> 01:06:38,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get too far into it, but I'm taking it very well.

788
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand the memeness.

789
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:42,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand the lulls in...

790
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:46,260
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck I'm going to go back to Zuckerberg's app.

791
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,661
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck I'm going to go to Musk's app.

792
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust them with my data at all.

793
01:06:51,202 --> 01:06:52,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go give my data to China.

794
01:06:53,043 --> 01:07:00,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what the whole Xiaohangshu exodus or whatever people joining that app is built on.

795
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:03,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say I think it is kind of adorable in a way.

796
01:07:03,647 --> 01:07:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks in China who have been firewalled for a very long time and folks in the U.S.

797
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:12,030
[SPEAKER_03]: that are actually like it feels like that whole thing when you have a pen pal when you're a kid.

798
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

799
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:41,450
[SPEAKER_03]: You let me know how the water is.

800
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,872
[SPEAKER_03]: You all confirm there's no piranhas in there.

801
01:07:44,572 --> 01:07:50,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll make an educated decision in a few weeks when we see some of these other cards.

802
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:54,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep saying House of Cards, but everything I've heard about Washington, D.C.

803
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,981
[SPEAKER_03]: is that it is nothing like the television show House of Cards.

804
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:05,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is everything like the television show Veep with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, if you've ever seen that show, which I would believe.

805
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:23,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my whole thing that I, I mean, and I just checked it, checked it out, you know, just once, is that the people on there have been really nice and welcoming, but a few people are taking the time to say, you know, our community works different this way.

806
01:08:23,342 --> 01:08:33,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is our cultural, you know, how we treat this app and how, what we would expect you to do because you're coming into our home.

807
01:08:33,524 --> 01:08:33,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

808
01:08:35,405 --> 01:08:42,433
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think has been a really cool statement that some of the bilingual people have made.

809
01:08:43,294 --> 01:08:45,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've really just been looking through it.

810
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:49,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, after five minutes, I was like, okay, I'm done with this.

811
01:08:49,701 --> 01:08:50,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

812
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:54,086
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it was interesting.

813
01:08:54,724 --> 01:09:04,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and again, yeah, I wouldn't expect to go onto an app like that and go, okay, here's my video on all the grievances I have with the Chinese government, blah, blah, blah.

814
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:05,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't do that.

815
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:11,809
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if LGBT content is censored, I can't talk about my actual life.

816
01:09:12,129 --> 01:09:15,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to censor who I am, that whole type of thing.

817
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:17,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just need a little more clarity on that.

818
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:18,010
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

819
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:18,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to – how far is –

820
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Xiaohang Xu.

821
01:09:22,252 --> 01:09:23,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not the same company.

822
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:27,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not the owners of TikTok and all that that are behind this.

823
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:34,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, how far are they going to go to really try to curate that app to an international audience with this whole thing going on?

824
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:34,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

825
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:35,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

826
01:09:35,502 --> 01:09:35,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

827
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you all have fun in the pool.

828
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand why you're doing it.

829
01:09:40,365 --> 01:09:41,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The lulz is lulzing.

830
01:09:42,347 --> 01:09:42,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

831
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:47,531
[SPEAKER_03]: The cultural exchange is cute, but I don't need to be there yet.

832
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:48,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all get it warmed up.

833
01:09:50,632 --> 01:09:50,892
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

834
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

835
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:58,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so anyway, that was all about Marvel Snap ultimately going dark.

836
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:02,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe it's back up yet for whatever reason.

837
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

838
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:03,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked.

839
01:10:03,781 --> 01:10:04,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

840
01:10:05,342 --> 01:10:07,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming they're going to have to fix it.

841
01:10:07,123 --> 01:10:10,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, ByteDance isn't actually involved with the game anymore.

842
01:10:10,886 --> 01:10:12,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So it reminds me of...

843
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:13,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that, but for Marvel Snap.

844
01:10:33,288 --> 01:10:43,166
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically going to have to scrub ByteDance off of everything in there and reassure everybody that it's all data in the States and all this stuff.

845
01:10:44,168 --> 01:10:44,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

846
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:48,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying TikTok for the time being.

847
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:49,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny.

848
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to never understand TikTok.

849
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And then probably in the last year and a half, I've been really getting into it.

850
01:10:53,996 --> 01:10:55,057
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really fun and cute.

851
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:55,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't create a lot.

852
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:57,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a video today, though.

853
01:10:57,439 --> 01:10:58,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't make a lot of content.

854
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, how do I follow up my banger from November that went viral?

855
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:04,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too much pressure, right?

856
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally thought of something this morning where I was like, well, this is kind of funny.

857
01:11:08,048 --> 01:11:09,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me laugh.

858
01:11:09,249 --> 01:11:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, all right, I'll post it.

859
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:12,092
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

860
01:11:13,753 --> 01:11:17,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, there's a lot of rumors and things and all this stuff.

861
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:19,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wait and just see what happens.

862
01:11:19,455 --> 01:11:32,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not love the pop-up message either, but unfortunately, I truly believe we are in for the next four years of this, is that there are going to be a lot of corporations that have their

863
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Lips firmly on the ass of the incoming president because unfortunately they know that's how you get ahead.

864
01:11:39,322 --> 01:11:43,365
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you don't get these reactionary things because that's how this guy governs.

865
01:11:44,125 --> 01:11:48,648
[SPEAKER_03]: We should not live in a country where anybody is able to hold the country hostage in that way.

866
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, elections have consequences.

867
01:11:54,592 --> 01:11:59,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So y'all that voted for it, I hope you enjoy the next.

868
01:12:00,196 --> 01:12:01,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you get everything you voted for.

869
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:12,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, though, for the rest of us who didn't, I plan on fighting.

870
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:14,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and you should.

871
01:12:14,552 --> 01:12:20,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying the rest of us have to roll over, but I'm just saying I think some people are going to be in for a big surprise.

872
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they get bit by their decision.

873
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:22,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Big surprise.

874
01:12:23,201 --> 01:12:23,642
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

875
01:12:24,827 --> 01:12:24,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

876
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:25,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

877
01:12:25,547 --> 01:12:25,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

878
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:49,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and then the whole frustration around this, of course, for me, and again, I'm trying not to get too political, but it's the world we live in.

879
01:12:49,076 --> 01:12:50,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it affects games.

880
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Case in point, this whole Marvel Snap thing, that is a political story.

881
01:12:56,099 --> 01:12:58,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That game came down for political reasons.

882
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, this affects games.

883
01:13:01,602 --> 01:13:03,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things where...

884
01:13:05,287 --> 01:13:06,909
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

885
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:25,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe Biden.

886
01:13:25,349 --> 01:13:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: It does rest on Biden.

887
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:29,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can say Biden is a fine politician.

888
01:13:30,012 --> 01:13:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done a lot of great things for this country.

889
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:42,801
[SPEAKER_03]: He made a colossally terrible decision in ever deciding to run for re-election and not reading the room that most people are sick of the octogenarian grip on this country.

890
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:48,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not reading his own mental capacity, honestly enough.

891
01:13:49,909 --> 01:14:14,297
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a lot of blame with the people who didn't show up at all and I understand, oh, they weren't enthused about it but that's where I look at it and I go when these next four years play out you're going to feel really sorry about that decision and I hope you can be okay with that that's all I have to say

892
01:14:16,778 --> 01:14:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on.

893
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:20,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't with people.

894
01:14:20,482 --> 01:14:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyway, so how about Evo?

895
01:14:23,205 --> 01:14:24,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, give me something to look forward to.

896
01:14:26,308 --> 01:14:32,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we had some audio issues live, so we're sorry about any choppiness you might have heard in those last few minutes.

897
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe we have fixed that, and we're going to pick back up with our next story, DarkSakura.

898
01:14:38,422 --> 01:14:38,662
[SPEAKER_04]: EVO 2025 EVO 2025

899
01:14:53,592 --> 01:15:00,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Official lineup is Fatal Fury, City of the Wolves, which is its first appearance at EVO and the one I'm actually interested in.

900
01:15:01,636 --> 01:15:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Granblue Fantasy vs. Rising, Guilty Gear Strive, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, New Age of Heroes, Mortal Kombat 1, Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, Under Night in Birth 2, Cicely's.

901
01:15:14,703 --> 01:15:20,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the extended lineup is BlazBlue Central Fiction, Killer Instinct,

902
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:29,488
[SPEAKER_04]: The King of Fighters 15, Rivals of Aether 2, Virtua Fighter 5 Revo, question mark, and more question marks, and even more than that.

903
01:15:29,848 --> 01:15:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love question mark.

904
01:15:31,109 --> 01:15:32,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite fighting game.

905
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:36,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just make a game that's just called, huh?

906
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:37,190
What?

907
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,190
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's question marks, but it's pronounced, huh?

908
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:41,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that, completely like that.

909
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a great game.

910
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would play my game, huh?

911
01:15:46,172 --> 01:15:47,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got it.

912
01:15:47,593 --> 01:15:49,153
[SPEAKER_04]: New, new OLR dream game.

913
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:49,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

914
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

915
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:52,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

916
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:55,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, question mark is the new OLR Dream Game.

917
01:15:55,748 --> 01:15:55,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

918
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:56,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

919
01:15:57,131 --> 01:15:57,652
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new game.

920
01:15:58,174 --> 01:15:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

921
01:15:59,015 --> 01:15:59,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it's pronounced.

922
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:01,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

923
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:01,721
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

924
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:08,560
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are going to put how to say the name in parentheses, you just have to use phonetic marking for it.

925
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my rule.

926
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:15,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe when I do my Unity course, I might just name my game that.

927
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:15,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

928
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:22,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll start Midna shooting at poop and toys and things.

929
01:16:23,004 --> 01:16:29,767
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that came to my mind just then when I was like... I think the full name I gave it... This is my dream game, not DarkSakura's.

930
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:30,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going...

931
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:33,036
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

932
01:16:33,616 --> 01:16:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot.

933
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was it, right?

934
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:39,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I picture a shooter game, but the challenge is you're high.

935
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the shooter game.

936
01:16:43,204 --> 01:16:44,505
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.

937
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:48,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I picture playing World of Warcraft with the drunk filter.

938
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:52,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I picture the huh, what, shoot game would be.

939
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:55,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Like point blank, but you're high.

940
01:16:55,535 --> 01:16:55,735
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

941
01:16:56,246 --> 01:17:04,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember my super drunk birthday party at Dave & Buster's where I made it to level 20-something on Luminous?

942
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:05,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually legit do.

943
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:07,255
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a hilarious party.

944
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:22,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And before I knew you, when I still lived in Alabama, I beat Raiden... Was it Raiden 3 or Raiden DX on PlayStation, drunk as shit on Everclear.

945
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:23,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

946
01:17:24,827 --> 01:17:30,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That wouldn't necessarily work well for me, given that I seem to play better when I'm intoxicated.

947
01:17:31,048 --> 01:17:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Love that.

948
01:17:32,609 --> 01:17:37,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but yeah, I think EVA's going to be great.

949
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:45,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be August 1st to 3rd at the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hill in, guess, Las Vegas!

950
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:49,595
[SPEAKER_03]: My least favorite convention center in the world.

951
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:50,395
[SPEAKER_04]: In Las Vegas.

952
01:17:50,655 --> 01:17:51,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

953
01:17:51,895 --> 01:17:56,596
[SPEAKER_04]: That place was a pain in the ass to walk around and find anything in.

954
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was hot.

955
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hope EVO's fun though.

956
01:18:01,237 --> 01:18:02,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in October.

957
01:18:03,818 --> 01:18:07,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hope EVO's fun and I hope Jamie Lee Curtis is there in secret.

958
01:18:07,759 --> 01:18:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: As she tends to be.

959
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:09,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

960
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remember, any cosplayer you see could be Jamie Lee Curtis.

961
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:15,181
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

962
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:16,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I've met her.

963
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:16,421
[SPEAKER_08]: She's nice.

964
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:42,166
[SPEAKER_04]: um but uh but yeah Evo no uh of course no Smash because of Nintendo and their reasons just reasons all right well maybe maybe there'll be a Switch 2 Smash in the future but at the same time let Sakurai take a vacation like a long one a long vacation yeah yeah all right let's move on Loki

965
01:18:43,775 --> 01:18:53,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Genshin Impact has been ordered by the FTC to stop selling microtransactions to children.

966
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:58,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently they have agreed to

967
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:06,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically block players under 16 years old from making in-game purchases without parental consent.

968
01:19:07,045 --> 01:19:12,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in order to settle a complaint that was received by the Federal Trade Commission.

969
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:15,469
[SPEAKER_02]: They've also agreed to pay a $20 million penalty.

970
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning.

971
01:19:25,295 --> 01:19:25,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

972
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:35,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the order, they want to prohibit Genshin Impact from selling loot blocks and virtual currency unless it also provides an option to purchase them directly with real money.

973
01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:41,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't EA being targeted with this as well?

974
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they have parental controls.

975
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:55,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they have, I think they have parental controls, but, like, I think it's, you know, they have an E-rated game that essentially they're selling loot boxes to.

976
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, why is this any different?

977
01:19:57,429 --> 01:20:24,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but yeah, it says Genshin Impact uses a gacha system instead of traditional loot box mechanics, whereas players can pull on banners to win random items or characters and the odds of winning are rare it says allegedly it sees players about the odds of winning and it's rare for loot boxes prizes to it says using a confusing virtual currency system so it is confusing

978
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:29,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got like four different currencies in that game.

979
01:20:29,949 --> 01:20:35,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure that EA, FC, and Madden have the same amount of currencies.

980
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:37,193
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt makes a very good point.

981
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:41,035
[SPEAKER_03]: EA has better lobbyists, meaning like governmental lobbyists.

982
01:20:41,115 --> 01:20:43,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the sad truth.

983
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:44,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that comment is on point.

984
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:46,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

985
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:48,779
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

986
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else to say on that?

987
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:54,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, that's it.

988
01:20:55,545 --> 01:20:55,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

989
01:20:56,305 --> 01:21:13,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm disappointed that they, like, yes, it's good that they are looking to stop the predatory practices, but it should be applied to all of the companies because I feel that there's a lot more that have been exploiting children for a lot longer, and I think they should target them.

990
01:21:13,589 --> 01:21:15,029
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, unfortunately, money talks.

991
01:21:15,449 --> 01:21:18,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

992
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:23,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe pay your lobbyists a bit more than what I would

993
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching.

994
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:26,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see you next time.

995
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:49,210
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

996
01:22:06,835 --> 01:22:15,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is to prevent what could happen in real life where somebody is trading a very rare card for a not so rare card where the other person doesn't know and all of that stuff.

997
01:22:15,825 --> 01:22:17,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only trade cards the same rarity.

998
01:22:17,848 --> 01:22:24,575
[SPEAKER_03]: There are eight rarity levels in this game, but the cards from the three highest tiers, they cannot be traded.

999
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: for now and of course those are the ones that most people who play this video game really want to get I actually think everything I need I would assume all the EXs are in this category and like everything I need to finish my decks are these EX cards like Aerodactyl EX I know is a card I'm missing so I don't know if I can trade for that I think it's in too high of one of the levels for that so everything else I bought with like the Stardust and that stuff so yeah it's kind of takes away the usefulness for some people

1000
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:59,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, items will have to be consumed in order to trade, but they don't say what it is.

1001
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:04,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be the hourglass currency that already exists in the game for wonder trades?

1002
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to come up with a new currency?

1003
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:07,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Highly likely.

1004
01:23:08,627 --> 01:23:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1005
01:23:09,547 --> 01:23:10,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Could it be Stardust?

1006
01:23:11,148 --> 01:23:12,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what they call it in the game anyway.

1007
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:18,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't really use Stardust for anything except putting cosmetics on cards right now, which I don't think a lot of people use.

1008
01:23:18,772 --> 01:23:19,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

1009
01:23:22,089 --> 01:23:24,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there are more packs, I believe, coming out soon.

1010
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there is a new expansion level coming soon.

1011
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:28,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've promised this month or next month.

1012
01:23:29,732 --> 01:23:34,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be pretty exciting because that always makes the game more interesting and gives you more stuff to open.

1013
01:23:34,955 --> 01:23:36,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll probably give you things to trade.

1014
01:23:37,156 --> 01:23:42,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe the reason why a lot of people aren't feeling this right now is because they're like, well, I have all the stuff.

1015
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:44,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to trade for anything.

1016
01:23:45,160 --> 01:24:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: but if they release new packs alongside of it then there's going to be stuff you can actively trade for which I think will make a little more sense at least but that's yeah I do enjoy the game I think it's cute I don't give it any money but it's a cute little time waster that's all and I go I try to upvote everybody's cosmetics once a day so you get your shop ticket because I love it when people do that for me I go in once a day and upvote everybody when I remember I don't do it every day because I don't always remember but when I'm sitting there you know

1017
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:16,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Play in mobile games.

1018
01:24:16,922 --> 01:24:17,243
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1019
01:24:17,663 --> 01:24:23,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's travel back to a simpler time when you couldn't do digital trading card games because you had a cartridge and that was it.

1020
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:29,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, don't think the pick this week is actually from that era, but let's roll the bumper all the same.

1021
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:47,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1022
01:24:48,384 --> 01:24:50,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1023
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:57,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy, this is one of those games where it's, oh, it's that old, huh?

1024
01:24:57,751 --> 01:24:59,733
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, what'd you pick for the classic game of the week?

1025
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked Dark Souls.

1026
01:25:04,056 --> 01:25:06,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And I specifically picked it because of Shayla.

1027
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: so uh because Shay's been playing quite a bit of this and I never got into it so I'm uh I'm doing it this is a big Alan series as well by the way Alan loves these games so Dark Souls is a game that came out in 2011 it's an action role play game that's developed by From Software published by Namco Bondi Games and it is a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls which is

1028
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:42,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Considered, I guess, first in the series, I reckon.

1029
01:25:43,742 --> 01:25:59,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So the game takes place in a kingdom called Lordran, where you play a cursed undead character who escapes from the undead asylum and tries to learn more about yourself, I guess.

1030
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:04,771
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a Windows port with additional content called the Prepare to Die edition.

1031
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:05,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in August 2012.

1032
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:13,275
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was released for consoles under the subtitle Artorias of the Abyss in October 2012.

1033
01:26:14,755 --> 01:26:25,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been called one of the greatest games ever made, people say, because of the intricate levels, the flavor text, the combat and the difficulty.

1034
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: the difficulty is very unforgiving um and yeah and it's had some sequels so um it is a third person action role-playing game where you really just need to explore but you really should be cautious because everything will kill you in a hit well not really

1035
01:26:47,342 --> 01:27:07,251
[SPEAKER_04]: but they can kill you pretty fast but you also will get different areas to get from one place to another you also have this bonfire that's a checkpoint for your levels and you can rest there and heal yourself and yeah

1036
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:34,604
[SPEAKER_04]: but the thing is it's very combat oriented you have melee ranged defense attacks magical abilities you have all kinds of different weaponry from great swords to clubs to maces and spears and stuff you have bows and arrows and crossbows and you have all kinds of different armor and shielding but you have your magic and uh

1037
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something listing as miracles on there?

1038
01:27:39,346 --> 01:27:40,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play a game where I have miracles.

1039
01:27:41,628 --> 01:27:47,914
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you can also do some smithing and you have consumable items and magical rings and new equipment and all kinds of stuff.

1040
01:27:48,594 --> 01:27:49,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's multiplayer.

1041
01:27:51,096 --> 01:27:54,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You can summon other players or NPCs to assist you.

1042
01:27:55,540 --> 01:28:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently you can be subject to invasions by others, so there's that.

1043
01:28:00,685 --> 01:28:00,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1044
01:28:03,923 --> 01:28:30,953
[SPEAKER_04]: you are apparently trying to go through that multiplayer mode to restore your humanity and if you die before you reach it then you lose anything that you've acquired in that mode so you have very restricted interaction as far as communication you have gestures and soapstones where you can write phrases to each other

1045
01:28:32,893 --> 01:28:34,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I mean, we have Discord, so whatever.

1046
01:28:36,995 --> 01:28:46,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But the multiplayer component for the PC version was disabled in February 2022 after a security threat within their matchmaking system was found.

1047
01:28:47,778 --> 01:29:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: October 2022, Namco Bandai confirmed online multiplayer for Prepare to Die had been permanently disabled due to the aging hardware, but that they are working for restoring multiplayer to the remastered version.

1048
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:04,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to get into the plot.

1049
01:29:07,835 --> 01:29:08,355
[SPEAKER_04]: You're undead.

1050
01:29:09,315 --> 01:29:10,016
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do stuff.

1051
01:29:11,956 --> 01:29:23,501
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the expansion, the Artorias of the Abyss, where you, again, are being undead and you're trying to prevent this land from being consumed by the Abyss.

1052
01:29:24,742 --> 01:29:24,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1053
01:29:26,448 --> 01:29:28,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go back to a little bit of the development.

1054
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:37,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It was developed by the creator as Hidetaka Miyazaki, who was the director and producer.

1055
01:29:38,497 --> 01:29:44,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it is a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls that was published by Sony.

1056
01:29:46,223 --> 01:29:54,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bandai Namco was chosen to do Dark Souls where they could do multiple platform distribution.

1057
01:29:56,711 --> 01:30:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So, some of the things that inspired Dark Souls was actually the manga series Berserk.

1058
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:13,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anyone's ever played any of the Berserk games or read the manga or watched any of the anime, but it has that very dark, hellish vibe.

1059
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:40,268
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, feel to it and as far as some of the locations in the game they're actually modeled after real world locations like the Anor Londo is based off of the Milan Cathedral and Chateau de Chambord so there's that there's also different folklore parallels for Greek mythology, Japanese mythology and French existentialism

1060
01:30:42,049 --> 01:30:46,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of influence by Nietzsche, so there you go.

1061
01:30:48,256 --> 01:30:50,298
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty deep.

1062
01:30:50,598 --> 01:30:51,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it can get pretty deep.

1063
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people, though, be completely silly with this.

1064
01:30:56,183 --> 01:30:58,746
[SPEAKER_04]: The PC version came out August 23, 2012, and there is a mod.

1065
01:31:00,968 --> 01:31:04,449
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes past the resolution cap called DS Fix.

1066
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:16,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was extended to become an official fan-made patch that allowed for graphical improvements and increasing your frame rate and using texture mods.

1067
01:31:17,393 --> 01:31:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: On December 15, 2014, Games for Windows Live was removed from the Steam version and replaced with Steamworks.

1068
01:31:25,635 --> 01:31:35,159
[SPEAKER_04]: and you could transfer your achievements and your save games and then Dark Souls became available on Xbox One via backwards compatibility in April 2016.

1069
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:44,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Souls Remastered had a worldwide release on PS4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2018 and Switch version October 19, 2018.

1070
01:31:49,025 --> 01:31:55,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It was ported by Qlock, a Polish studio, and the Switch version was done by Virtuos, which is out of Singapore.

1071
01:31:56,729 --> 01:32:06,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It runs at an 8 of 60 FPS, except for the Switch, and it supports a 4K resolution on PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One, and Windows.

1072
01:32:07,374 --> 01:32:14,158
[SPEAKER_04]: They made some changes to online multiplayer, including dedicated servers and increasing the number of players from 4 to 6 with password matchmaking.

1073
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:17,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, very well received.

1074
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:24,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Its PC Metacritic score was 85 out of 100, PS3, 89, Xbox 360, 89.

1075
01:32:26,301 --> 01:32:28,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40.

1076
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:30,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, that's pretty big.

1077
01:32:32,023 --> 01:32:39,545
[SPEAKER_04]: The level design was among its biggest compliments, that and how deep the gameplay and the tone of the game was.

1078
01:32:41,246 --> 01:32:59,581
[SPEAKER_04]: but the extreme difficulty itself though IGN is quoted saying there's a difference between punishing and downright unfair but Eurogamer said that the difficulty may not appeal to casual gamers but yeah it's a

1079
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:08,205
[SPEAKER_04]: It had some not-so-great reviews for some of the later releases.

1080
01:33:08,285 --> 01:33:18,450
[SPEAKER_04]: So GameSpy said that the original Windows port was shabby, where it was limited to this 30 FPS and poor mouse and keyboard function.

1081
01:33:20,431 --> 01:33:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: So not everyone received it well enough.

1082
01:33:25,553 --> 01:33:30,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to read some of the other discussions about it because they get downright insulting.

1083
01:33:31,797 --> 01:33:37,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But Game Revolution gave it a Game of the Year award for Community Choice Game of the Weird.

1084
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It won all sorts of awards.

1085
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:45,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was voted for the Ultimate Game of All Time at the Golden Joystick Awards in 2021.

1086
01:33:47,587 --> 01:33:53,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then it created an entire legacy of things now referred to as Souls-like.

1087
01:33:55,476 --> 01:34:03,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Other games that were said to be influenced by it were Destiny, Alienation, Lords of the Fallen, The Surge, Salt and Sanctuary, Shovel Knight.

1088
01:34:03,945 --> 01:34:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Titan Souls, Enter the Gungeon, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, Naio, God of War I mean, but then we also have its own sequels which is, you know, we had Dark Souls 2 and 3 and we've also had its other spiritual successors like Elden Ring and I would even say Sekiro Shadows Die Twice is included in that so there you go, it's Dark Souls

1089
01:34:29,258 --> 01:34:29,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1090
01:34:30,078 --> 01:34:30,679
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1091
01:34:30,759 --> 01:34:34,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely definitely a classic, a modern classic of sorts.

1092
01:34:34,921 --> 01:34:42,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, this is a game that I know Alan is very proud of the fact that he has platinum this game or whatever the equivalent of a platinum is on Steam.

1093
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:45,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is which takes a lot of work to do that.

1094
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:49,868
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's and I think he did it with Dark Souls 2 as well, but not three.

1095
01:34:50,028 --> 01:34:52,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's I think three is like somehow different or something.

1096
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1097
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:55,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It has cooties or somehow is otherwise different.

1098
01:34:55,971 --> 01:34:57,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I know.

1099
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:58,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously like like cooties.

1100
01:34:59,113 --> 01:35:06,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you pointed out there at the end, it kind of has spawned a whole genre of games that are that Souls-like.

1101
01:35:06,302 --> 01:35:11,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And whenever you sort of die and you lose everything and the bag is there, I hear like, oh, that game's the Souls-like.

1102
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:13,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of funny.

1103
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1104
01:35:14,983 --> 01:35:22,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, like some of the ones that they compared it to like Enter the Gungeon and stuff, I'd see that as less of a Souls-like and more of a roguelike game, but I don't know.

1105
01:35:22,428 --> 01:35:24,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a little bit of both.

1106
01:35:24,349 --> 01:35:25,590
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of both.

1107
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:26,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, yeah.

1108
01:35:27,191 --> 01:35:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but there's also like the biggest thing that they're including is that there's like the Bonfire checkpoint.

1109
01:35:34,675 --> 01:35:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: um like respawn points um you know where you go to actually put all your stuff together and uh and you know I guess reconvene yourself um but you know um it it has like some ridiculous death animations you know different ways funny ways that you can die um

1110
01:35:58,237 --> 01:36:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: but some other games that are included in that too is like Bloodborne even Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order was kind of included in that Darksiders 3 I'm just trying to think of other names that were more that were influenced by some of those games too was like Dead Cells and Blasphemous and Black Myth Wukong but yeah

1111
01:36:23,365 --> 01:36:29,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just think of, like, when, like, Souls, like, it's usually, like, extremely tough bosses.

1112
01:36:29,193 --> 01:36:30,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely fucking difficult, yeah.

1113
01:36:30,895 --> 01:36:31,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Shay!

1114
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:32,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1115
01:36:32,798 --> 01:36:37,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were kind of right with some of it, but, like, yeah, I don't know.

1116
01:36:37,644 --> 01:36:38,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1117
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:39,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So Shay's a small Shay.

1118
01:36:39,847 --> 01:36:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1119
01:36:42,184 --> 01:36:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: who I told I was talking about the game says that basically Dark Souls is somewhat challenging but so fun once you learn builds but PvP is scary oh yeah the PvP in that game seems really nasty

1120
01:36:59,375 --> 01:36:59,695
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1121
01:37:00,476 --> 01:37:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much, Dark Souls, your classic game of the week.

1122
01:37:04,578 --> 01:37:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we just have a little bit more for you here, and then we'll see if any of you have anything to say from calling in or what have you.

1123
01:37:11,341 --> 01:37:12,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to some rapid-fire news.

1124
01:37:13,002 --> 01:37:13,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1125
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:14,923
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1126
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:20,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's that time, that time to tell you about a new thing that you can play Doom on.

1127
01:37:20,626 --> 01:37:22,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you're excited, but now, hey.

1128
01:37:22,927 --> 01:37:23,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Refrigerator.

1129
01:37:25,264 --> 01:37:29,708
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but your office work might be more exciting now because you can play Doom on a PDF.

1130
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:31,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what?

1131
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:44,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone has built Doom into a PDF and it only works in Chromium browsers, but it essentially renders the game using ASCII art.

1132
01:37:45,822 --> 01:37:47,123
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks really good.

1133
01:37:48,144 --> 01:37:48,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1134
01:37:49,874 --> 01:38:14,718
[SPEAKER_02]: and so yeah you can check out they have a whole github page and there's a full description how they achieved all that but pretty crazy to see Doom in a PDF I'm pretty sure there's like nothing that you can play Doom on or can't play Doom on anymore so and if there is they'll find a way to get it on there so don't you worry don't you worry exactly I just remember playing Doom

1135
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:19,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Black and White Doom on Mac Classics when I was in college.

1136
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:28,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, after the apocalypse, there will be cockroaches, Cher, and Doom and Linux ports will be the things that are still with us after the apocalypse.

1137
01:38:29,959 --> 01:38:30,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Which may be tomorrow.

1138
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1139
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: A little dark humor, people.

1140
01:38:34,302 --> 01:38:34,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark humor.

1141
01:38:36,028 --> 01:38:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: then speaking of apocalypse we have a fortnight a new fortnight thing going on where you can actually get skins for Godzilla and King Kong and also turn into Godzilla apparently it looks like kind of like what they did with some of these other events like the Thanos glove and all that stuff

1142
01:38:56,494 --> 01:39:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: but those will be so they're going to have like cosmetics and stuff it's actually apparently the event's going to run from well already started actually since the 17th through February 21st and you'll have to take down giant sized Godzilla's I don't see any King Kong's though but neat I mean at this point like anything any sort of like IP in Fortnite is not a surprise anymore

1143
01:39:26,836 --> 01:39:45,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not surprised Bob Coffee in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says a Doom PDF is almost as impressive as Doom on a pregnancy test that's right, I forgot about Doom on a pregnancy test that was a few months ago, we had that story that's less, I think, less actually playing Doom on the, I don't think it was running on that that test, I think it was just

1144
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:49,042
[SPEAKER_02]: um, displayed on that test.

1145
01:39:49,062 --> 01:39:50,743
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1146
01:39:50,763 --> 01:39:51,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1147
01:39:51,303 --> 01:39:51,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1148
01:39:51,584 --> 01:39:52,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But still!

1149
01:39:52,524 --> 01:39:53,045
[SPEAKER_02]: But still!

1150
01:39:53,285 --> 01:39:54,186
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still crazy.

1151
01:39:54,486 --> 01:39:54,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1152
01:39:54,826 --> 01:39:55,607
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1153
01:39:56,147 --> 01:39:57,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still an accomplishment.

1154
01:39:57,368 --> 01:39:58,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not belittle the accomplishment.

1155
01:39:58,769 --> 01:39:59,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1156
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1157
01:40:01,391 --> 01:40:01,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1158
01:40:02,232 --> 01:40:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1159
01:40:04,657 --> 01:40:09,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, a game that... It's a fun little game, too.

1160
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:24,494
[SPEAKER_04]: One I've enjoyed playing, of course, I played an import of it before, is there's a game called Mr. Gimmick, which was its original name, that was out in Japan and Sweden.

1161
01:40:25,135 --> 01:40:25,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1162
01:40:26,095 --> 01:40:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah but it's finally going to get a North American NES release on an actual cartridge on January 24th the pre-orders will go live on January 24th there's a standard version for $60 it gets you the game and the cartridge but there's also a $100 collector's edition that gets you a green cartridge a numbered foil slipcover a deluxe foil box soundtrack 12x16 poster a manual and an enamel pin

1163
01:40:54,384 --> 01:40:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's being put out by Limited Run Games.

1164
01:40:57,986 --> 01:40:59,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a cute little game.

1165
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:08,031
[SPEAKER_04]: You play as a little yokai who is given to a girl accidentally as a toy and then she gets kidnapped and you go to save your little friend.

1166
01:41:10,713 --> 01:41:13,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was Mr. Gimmick and we're getting it released as Gimmick.

1167
01:41:14,474 --> 01:41:14,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1168
01:41:16,777 --> 01:41:28,447
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, speaking of retro classics, Edea has licensed nine old titles to Shin Uden is the company that's going to license these.

1169
01:41:29,188 --> 01:41:31,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Then these will show up on modern platforms.

1170
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:35,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I haven't heard of a lot of these games, but I'm pretty sure I know Final Zone.

1171
01:41:35,534 --> 01:41:38,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the game that's coming out first on the Switch on January 17th.

1172
01:41:39,657 --> 01:41:45,318
[SPEAKER_03]: and there will be ports on other platforms after that as well, such as PS5, Xbox Series, PC.

1173
01:41:45,398 --> 01:41:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know the drill.

1174
01:41:46,478 --> 01:41:48,219
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the titles that will be released.

1175
01:41:48,739 --> 01:41:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know any of these, DarkSakura?

1176
01:41:50,339 --> 01:42:04,662
[SPEAKER_03]: These are really obscure ones to me, but we have Dinoland, Exile and Exile Wicked Phenomenon, Final Zone, Gaudi, Barcelona No Case, Griffin, Psycho Dream, Soul Deus and... Psycho Dream.

1177
01:42:04,822 --> 01:42:05,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Psycho Dream?

1178
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:06,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's one of them.

1179
01:42:06,563 --> 01:42:07,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few of those.

1180
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:10,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have seen this Psycho Dream before.

1181
01:42:10,865 --> 01:42:15,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you did this as a classic game or what, but I've seen this one before.

1182
01:42:15,888 --> 01:42:18,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Shinyu Den and Final Zone, actually, both of those.

1183
01:42:19,071 --> 01:42:21,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

1184
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:24,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind of Barcelona.

1185
01:42:24,974 --> 01:42:26,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's about Gaudi.

1186
01:42:26,896 --> 01:42:29,878
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Anthony Gaudi.

1187
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:30,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1188
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:34,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I know of this one.

1189
01:42:35,366 --> 01:42:43,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That EZE shop or whatever they call themselves will label all of this shovelware because this is very niche.

1190
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:45,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this was a PC-88 and Sharp X68000.

1191
01:42:46,032 --> 01:42:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Retro titles, yeah.

1192
01:42:48,213 --> 01:42:50,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to do with Gaudi's

1193
01:42:55,822 --> 01:42:56,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Words, words, words, architecture.

1194
01:42:57,924 --> 01:42:58,284
[SPEAKER_04]: That's neat.

1195
01:42:59,025 --> 01:43:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1196
01:43:01,908 --> 01:43:04,750
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I understand, I think it was more of a text-based game, if I recall correctly.

1197
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:05,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quote me.

1198
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:13,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some other games coming out that aren't just ports or otherwise.

1223
01:45:53,185 --> 01:45:54,046

[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not sure Sailor Uniform Schoolgirl I'm actually maybe I could show this last picture but I'm actually a little afraid to show some of the other ones because I would not want to get the fine Voice of Geeks Network band off of Twitch television and those boobies are very big yes

1227
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1228
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,362
[SPEAKER_04]: At the moment you said the name, I'm like, oh, I bet that's naughty.

1229
01:46:44,582 --> 01:46:45,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Her poor back.

1230
01:46:45,883 --> 01:46:46,183
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1231
01:46:46,343 --> 01:46:55,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the Sweet Cafe Collection, if you're looking for something hopefully a little more innocent, is coming out in a regular and limited edition also in Japan.

1232
01:46:56,969 --> 01:46:58,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's it for the 23rd.

1233
01:46:59,410 --> 01:47:02,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me get to the PlayStation 5 titles also on the 23rd.

01:47:02,972 --> 01:47:05,814
[SPEAKER_03]: You have some new wireless controller colors out in Japan.

01:47:06,414 --> 01:47:07,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Chroma Teal is out.

01:47:23,991 --> 01:47:26,133

[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1246
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:56,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1247
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Well guess what folks?

1248
01:47:58,961 --> 01:48:00,282
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting towards the end of the show.

1249
01:48:01,243 --> 01:48:02,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We sure are.

1250
01:48:02,084 --> 01:48:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it.

1251
01:48:02,604 --> 01:48:04,165
[SPEAKER_03]: That was everything we had slated.

1252
01:48:04,425 --> 01:48:13,932
[SPEAKER_03]: The Switch 2 has kind of dominated the conversation then all the political things we got into earlier have kind of dominated the tech world as well so you know the gaming news has felt a little bit...

1253
01:48:14,853 --> 01:48:15,093
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1254
01:48:15,173 --> 01:48:19,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We had other news, but I don't... I'm just going to briefly mention it so we can acknowledge it.

1255
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:26,739
[SPEAKER_02]: There was drama between an elongated muskrat and the internet because somebody is faking their gaming clout.

1256
01:48:27,939 --> 01:48:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.

1257
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:30,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not news.

1258
01:48:32,081 --> 01:48:33,102
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that already.

1259
01:48:33,242 --> 01:48:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew that already.

1260
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:37,804
[SPEAKER_03]: What about a muskrat?

1261
01:48:38,584 --> 01:48:41,886
[SPEAKER_03]: The current owner of the social media platform we used to like...

1262
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: has been making some tall tale claims on their Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 performance, of which there have been many professional players, specifically a Path of Exile 2, who very much debunked what he was-

1263
01:49:02,897 --> 01:49:10,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to mention that he was also in apparently a live stream talking to people while someone else was playing the game.

1264
01:49:10,345 --> 01:49:15,650
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we can see that you're online right now in this game, but you're also over here doing this thing.

1265
01:49:16,391 --> 01:49:18,794
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the thing.

1266
01:49:19,675 --> 01:49:20,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, he didn't know how to play it.

1267
01:49:21,036 --> 01:49:49,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote a bleat about this and I wanted to because somebody had yeah I saw the article that I guess Vice ran the whole expose on how he's cheating and the headline read Elon Musk is being accused of cheating at video games by allegedly using loopholes and hiring users to pay for play for him this was my response I'm gonna read this word of word because I think this is important I'm actually glad you brought this up Loki because especially going into tomorrow and what we can expect over the next four years this is very important

1268
01:49:51,445 --> 01:49:56,166
[SPEAKER_03]: He did it because he thinks gamers are fools and easily influenceable.

1269
01:49:57,046 --> 01:50:04,729
[SPEAKER_03]: After all, look at some things born of the Twitter echo chambers such as GamerGate that probably made him interested in it in the first place.

1270
01:50:05,489 --> 01:50:08,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You just marinate on that and don't you forget it.

1271
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:11,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Elon Musk thinks gamers are gullible.

1272
01:50:12,871 --> 01:50:17,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will find this nice little spot on the hill to die on because I said that.

1273
01:50:19,868 --> 01:50:20,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them underestimate us.

1274
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:26,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, there's a lot of people that are falling for it, but he's not going to get everybody.

1275
01:50:26,493 --> 01:50:28,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Let them underestimate us.

1276
01:50:28,675 --> 01:50:29,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1277
01:50:30,696 --> 01:50:31,597
[SPEAKER_04]: We will show them.

1278
01:50:32,277 --> 01:50:34,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remember.

1279
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:46,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a firm believer in making those who underestimate you extra comfortable so they don't see it when you utterly destroy them.

1280
01:50:49,642 --> 01:50:52,043
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura said you could hear that mic drop from space.

1281
01:50:52,144 --> 01:50:53,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad the audio is working again.

1282
01:50:55,265 --> 01:50:58,847
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1283
01:50:58,947 --> 01:50:59,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1284
01:50:59,268 --> 01:51:04,451
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, I will pitch our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1285
01:51:04,751 --> 01:51:07,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You can join us and talk to us throughout the week.

1286
01:51:08,433 --> 01:51:11,295
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do want to call in real quick, we have the green room is open and available.

1287
01:51:11,895 --> 01:51:12,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me check in with you.

1288
01:51:12,535 --> 01:51:12,975
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no email.

1289
01:51:13,236 --> 01:51:13,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1290
01:51:13,956 --> 01:51:17,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you want to send us an email, participate at orangehondrader.com.

1291
01:51:17,618 --> 01:51:18,178
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1292
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:43,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go into and make male rules.

1293
01:51:44,173 --> 01:51:44,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

1294
01:51:44,553 --> 01:51:45,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love that.

1295
01:51:45,694 --> 01:51:46,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

1296
01:51:46,274 --> 01:51:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wish that we had a bounce back feature.

1297
01:51:49,397 --> 01:51:52,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we do invite them on the show and just trash them.

1298
01:51:53,881 --> 01:51:54,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

1299
01:51:54,301 --> 01:51:55,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like absolutely.

1300
01:51:55,122 --> 01:51:57,604
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have like a special episode where we mock our enemies.

1301
01:51:58,985 --> 01:52:00,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we do that anyway, but still.

1302
01:52:01,665 --> 01:52:03,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what the fuck this show is?

1303
01:52:03,567 --> 01:52:04,107
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

1304
01:52:05,648 --> 01:52:11,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if this was 20 years ago, if this was the Travis Donovan experience, 100%.

1305
01:52:13,293 --> 01:52:11,932
100%.

1306
01:52:13,313 --> 01:52:15,634
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just feel like... Maybe it's in for a spinoff.

1307
01:52:15,994 --> 01:52:18,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I'm older, my time is more valuable.

1308
01:52:20,737 --> 01:52:21,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1309
01:52:21,638 --> 01:52:22,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a fuck you of the week.

1310
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:24,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

1311
01:52:24,679 --> 01:52:25,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

1312
01:52:25,976 --> 01:52:28,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to point out, though, and I think Bobby Blackwolf has a very good point.

1313
01:52:29,099 --> 01:52:31,841
[SPEAKER_03]: They still want to come on because they feel like they can change you.

1314
01:52:32,201 --> 01:52:33,923
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to debate you and fix you.

1315
01:52:34,543 --> 01:52:35,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I can change you.

1316
01:52:35,724 --> 01:52:36,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I can change you.

1317
01:52:36,805 --> 01:52:38,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to embarrass them.

1318
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I need.

1319
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:44,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a big, strong man to change me.

1320
01:52:47,534 --> 01:52:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So my FU actually goes toward...

1321
01:52:53,955 --> 01:52:54,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Zuck.

1322
01:52:55,762 --> 01:52:56,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And the entire meta.

1323
01:52:58,352 --> 01:52:58,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

1324
01:53:01,151 --> 01:53:25,902
[SPEAKER_04]: um and this also goes a little bit towards I'm an activist but dot dot dot you know um you're either gonna take a stand or you're not end of story so if you stay on those platforms you are gonna be now I'm not saying go delete your name but don't you know log in don't give it attention don't you know don't let someone else try to steal your identity certainly not

1325
01:53:26,602 --> 01:53:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're talking about WhatsApp.

1326
01:53:28,683 --> 01:53:29,844
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about Facebook.

1327
01:53:29,864 --> 01:53:31,164
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about Instagram.

1328
01:53:31,184 --> 01:53:32,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about threads.

1329
01:53:33,205 --> 01:53:34,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those things.

1330
01:53:35,407 --> 01:53:41,710
[SPEAKER_04]: You are supporting a company that is participating in trans erasure.

1331
01:53:43,211 --> 01:53:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Right then and there.

1332
01:53:46,226 --> 01:54:04,046
[SPEAKER_04]: protections have been removed and by continuing to go on these sites you are supporting that there are other nasty things that you are supporting by participating on those websites as well but I'm just saying this right now I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but I want but you know they say if the shoe fits you know

1333
01:54:05,765 --> 01:54:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1334
01:54:06,946 --> 01:54:08,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my F you.

1335
01:54:08,887 --> 01:54:13,949
[SPEAKER_03]: There are things for people that feel like they really cannot leave meta everything.

1336
01:54:13,989 --> 01:54:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Messenger and WhatsApp, I think, are the two that are very difficult for some people because of family contact or international contact or whatever.

1337
01:54:21,753 --> 01:54:26,896
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really feel you can't leave those platforms, there are some really good guides about things you can do.

1338
01:54:27,196 --> 01:54:28,417
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other things you can do to reduce.

1339
01:54:28,437 --> 01:54:29,057
[SPEAKER_03]: There are alternatives too.

1340
01:54:29,477 --> 01:54:38,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and there are things you can do to reduce still meta's influence over like, you know, do you need the apps on your phone is a big one to start with because that's the thing that's always pulling your data down, you know, those sorts of things.

1341
01:54:39,091 --> 01:54:40,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we actually have somebody here.

1342
01:54:41,955 --> 01:54:42,356
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Line.

1343
01:54:42,756 --> 01:54:45,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got on that PixelFed.

1344
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:45,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1345
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:50,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that one's still a little, it's, yeah, it's, it's got to grow.

1346
01:54:50,414 --> 01:54:51,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, hopefully it will.

1347
01:54:51,575 --> 01:54:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it will.

1348
01:54:52,676 --> 01:54:53,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have somebody in the green room.

1349
01:54:54,297 --> 01:54:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to talk to this person.

1350
01:54:55,658 --> 01:54:56,819
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, let's bring him on real quick.

1351
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.

1352
01:55:00,081 --> 01:55:00,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1353
01:55:02,142 --> 01:55:04,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, it's Aaron.

1354
01:55:04,384 --> 01:55:05,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Aaron.

1355
01:55:05,464 --> 01:55:05,885
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you?

1356
01:55:05,965 --> 01:55:06,985
[SPEAKER_11]: You sound depressed.

1357
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:07,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you okay?

1358
01:55:08,382 --> 01:55:10,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not depressed, I'm just tired.

1359
01:55:10,943 --> 01:55:11,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1360
01:55:12,824 --> 01:55:14,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Tired in multiple ways.

1361
01:55:16,085 --> 01:55:17,005
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is hope.

1362
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:34,151
[SPEAKER_11]: My co-worker who is in his 60s was bragging about how he and all the people he knows have now joined Red Note and

1363
01:55:35,831 --> 01:55:39,173
[SPEAKER_11]: are finding all kinds of fun people to talk with there.

1364
01:55:39,973 --> 01:55:40,953
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've heard about that.

1365
01:55:41,013 --> 01:55:41,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, wait a minute.

1366
01:55:42,754 --> 01:55:47,836
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy is downloading random Chinese social media apps now?

1367
01:55:49,516 --> 01:55:52,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a lot of people that went that direction for sure.

1368
01:55:54,378 --> 01:55:55,779
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty interesting to me.

1369
01:55:57,279 --> 01:55:59,260
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, this is all...

1370
01:56:00,939 --> 01:56:02,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Social media was a mistake.

1371
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,241
[SPEAKER_11]: It sometimes starts to feel that way, doesn't it?

1372
01:56:06,502 --> 01:56:09,744
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about... We should have never left LiveJournal.

1373
01:56:10,204 --> 01:56:11,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously!

1374
01:56:11,385 --> 01:56:12,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1375
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about Xiaohongshu.

1376
01:56:15,787 --> 01:56:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you have other things on your mind.

1377
01:56:17,488 --> 01:56:18,228
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

1378
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:21,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yes, I'm tired.

1379
01:56:22,411 --> 01:56:26,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been staring at this game that I'm creating for a very long time.

1380
01:56:27,053 --> 01:56:34,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that actually this month marks 10 years since I started working on this little game that I was calling multitasking?

1381
01:56:35,055 --> 01:56:35,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1382
01:56:35,756 --> 01:56:36,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

1383
01:56:36,696 --> 01:56:48,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that because I was messing around with games on my Steam Deck and I saw the forums for Super Multitasking and I have a feeling I know what's coming and I'm really excited.

1384
01:56:48,599 --> 01:56:49,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So, please.

1385
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1386
01:56:50,780 --> 01:57:19,847
[SPEAKER_11]: well right now I'm mostly using it for tech support there's this dude I think in Japan who grabbed the beta of SuperDuper multitasking and he's having trouble with it and I figured out that it has to do with the encryption library I'm throwing in there but it's weird because it's working for me so yes multitasking could in theory no actually multitasking

1387
01:57:20,307 --> 01:57:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: The original multitasking came out on Xbox Live Indie Games in I believe it was either late 2015 or early 2016.

1388
01:57:29,496 --> 01:57:33,621
[SPEAKER_11]: So no, not eligible for Classic Game of the Week just yet.

1389
01:57:36,163 --> 01:57:37,865
[SPEAKER_11]: But bungee ferret tossing is.

1390
01:57:38,666 --> 01:57:39,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, interesting.

1391
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:39,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to know.

1392
01:57:41,228 --> 01:57:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Find me a long play video.

1393
01:57:44,366 --> 01:57:44,886
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1394
01:57:45,026 --> 01:57:57,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say just wait on it until I finally get my stuff together and release the new version on PC that I worked on several years ago and then didn't finish because I got distracted by other things.

1395
01:57:57,491 --> 01:57:58,191
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it goes.

1396
01:57:59,451 --> 01:58:04,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So Super Duper Multitasking is in beta right now if people want to check that out.

1397
01:58:05,373 --> 01:58:13,336
[SPEAKER_11]: If you own the game Super Multitasking, if you just put yourself in the beta track, you can go right ahead and play the new one right now.

1398
01:58:14,656 --> 01:58:15,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1399
01:58:16,937 --> 01:58:30,064
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm really trying to stick to February 4th as the final ultimate release date because it needs to be done already.

1400
01:58:31,585 --> 01:58:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you showing it at a show that weekend or something too, if I remember right?

1401
01:58:35,587 --> 01:58:36,968
[SPEAKER_11]: MAGFest this weekend.

1402
01:58:37,288 --> 01:58:38,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, MAGFest!

1403
01:58:38,769 --> 01:58:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're showing it at MAG!

1404
01:58:40,543 --> 01:58:41,324
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1405
01:58:51,761 --> 01:58:52,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited.

1406
01:58:53,422 --> 01:58:54,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tired, though.

1407
01:58:55,202 --> 01:58:57,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking for it to happen already.

1408
01:58:57,762 --> 01:58:58,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Please get a nap.

1409
01:58:58,483 --> 01:59:02,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got a whole bunch of stuff in my hallway already, clogging it up.

1410
01:59:02,423 --> 01:59:09,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But to those out there listening, please go by Aaron's booth, and it'll be very easy to see the game.

1411
01:59:09,645 --> 01:59:10,265
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll know it.

1412
01:59:10,945 --> 01:59:13,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like WarioWare, but like five of them going on at once.

1413
01:59:15,247 --> 01:59:16,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a picture.

1414
01:59:16,627 --> 01:59:18,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I'll take pictures.

1415
01:59:18,889 --> 01:59:20,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take lots of pictures.

1416
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:23,371
[SPEAKER_04]: People who visit you need to take a picture and show up.

1417
01:59:23,492 --> 01:59:25,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take pictures of them.

1418
01:59:25,032 --> 01:59:25,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be a creeper.

1419
01:59:26,161 --> 01:59:55,520
[SPEAKER_03]: but um if you yeah if you are going to MAG check this game out please because it's so well and I remember the one of the years I did go to MAG was you were showing the game although it wasn't I don't think it was totally out yet it might have been on an Xbox but you didn't you didn't have it totally out yet and you you had like a full booth it seemed like almost the whole time people were always coming by and playing it and like really enjoying it and that's that's the thing when people get their hands on it they realize how addicting it is so I'm I'm really glad you get to put it in front of people at such a show like that that's so good

1420
01:59:56,408 --> 01:59:58,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm going to run it 24 hours again.

1421
01:59:59,151 --> 02:00:05,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, I'm going to be showing something else with it.

1422
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:11,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been actually asked for this several times over the last few years.

1423
02:00:12,104 --> 02:00:13,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, all right, you know what?

1424
02:00:13,766 --> 02:00:14,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

1425
02:00:14,787 --> 02:00:16,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time to bring back Snake.

1426
02:00:18,413 --> 02:00:18,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1427
02:00:19,014 --> 02:00:23,375
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Snake 360, which was one of your early, early games.

1428
02:00:23,395 --> 02:00:24,596
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of your earliest games, right?

1429
02:00:26,297 --> 02:00:27,237
[SPEAKER_03]: A new version for Steam?

1430
02:00:28,297 --> 02:00:44,024
[SPEAKER_11]: So barely anyone noticed, but in 2016, I put out a new version called Snake Party, which was kind of like the evolution of the battle mode plus some other random stuff like missions and things like that.

1431
02:00:44,524 --> 02:00:44,764
[SPEAKER_11]: So

1432
02:00:46,605 --> 02:01:08,019
[SPEAKER_11]: this is going to be called Snake Party Extreme and it's basically just going to be the Snake 360 campaign the Snake Party battle mode and just like all the things all the things and hopefully I'm going to get around to improving the graphics just a little bit Snake Party Extreme sounds like a fun Saturday night to me

1433
02:01:10,771 --> 02:01:13,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's going to be super fun.

1434
02:01:13,752 --> 02:01:15,733
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope people have a really good time with it.

1435
02:01:18,173 --> 02:01:19,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I should sleep though.

1436
02:01:20,074 --> 02:01:24,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I've been streaming The Legend of Zelda ROM hacks on Saturday nights.

1437
02:01:24,975 --> 02:01:26,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I've caught some of that.

1438
02:01:26,136 --> 02:01:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1439
02:01:27,696 --> 02:01:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Your YouTube archives of it is what I've kind of noticed.

1440
02:01:30,257 --> 02:01:31,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

1441
02:01:31,757 --> 02:01:33,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super happy you're watching.

1442
02:01:34,378 --> 02:01:35,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's crazy.

1443
02:01:35,879 --> 02:01:38,900
[SPEAKER_11]: This one dude is just making these crazy ROM hacks where like

1444
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:41,401
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1445
02:01:57,112 --> 02:01:57,472
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1446
02:01:58,012 --> 02:01:59,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda Souls.

1447
02:01:59,853 --> 02:02:01,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I did beat it in one stream.

1448
02:02:01,373 --> 02:02:02,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that hard.

1449
02:02:02,573 --> 02:02:05,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Zelda Adventures Link, but I guess it's not the same.

1450
02:02:06,014 --> 02:02:09,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I've gotten original Zelda down below 40 minutes finally.

1451
02:02:11,175 --> 02:02:15,556
[SPEAKER_11]: But the ultimate goal is to beat it in an hour on the dance pad.

1452
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not close.

1453
02:02:17,976 --> 02:02:18,756
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I love that.

1454
02:02:18,776 --> 02:02:20,797
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so fun.

1455
02:02:21,117 --> 02:02:25,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, stop doing the dance pad so much.

1456
02:02:25,318 --> 02:02:26,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tried Rod Calibur?

1457
02:02:26,943 --> 02:02:51,478
[SPEAKER_11]: for the record I was swinging the rod on Soul Calibur back when it first released because I was one of the kooky folks that just had to grab every Dreamcast thing immediately and I was like oh Sega Bass Fishing this is amazing yeah let's I gotta get the rod I have beaten Soul Calibur with the dance pad

1458
02:02:52,907 --> 02:03:08,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we tried that one time too because of course we had the Dreamcast DDR also and I don't know I think Rod Calibur was a little more satisfying Can you swing the rod at Snake Party Extreme?

1459
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:21,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can swing it at it but it won't have any function in game unfortunately But it might be fun at the party It absolutely would You can definitely have your snake party with the rod

1460
02:03:25,851 --> 02:03:27,139
[SPEAKER_11]: with a person named Rod.

1461
02:03:27,742 --> 02:03:29,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Rod Rodders, yeah, sure, of course.

1462
02:03:31,613 --> 02:03:32,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, no, I am.

1463
02:03:32,793 --> 02:03:33,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seriously happy for you.

1464
02:03:33,853 --> 02:03:34,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy for MagFest.

1465
02:03:34,834 --> 02:03:38,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy for people to check out and all the silliness of the name.

1466
02:03:38,534 --> 02:03:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a fun.

1467
02:03:39,294 --> 02:03:40,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I had fun with Snake360.

1468
02:03:40,875 --> 02:03:45,855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a throwback to the old Nokia Snake game, but, you know, amped up.

1469
02:03:46,156 --> 02:03:49,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have Kyle Ward's permission for his music?

1470
02:03:49,976 --> 02:03:51,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he had a banger soundtrack in that.

02:05:10,468 --> 02:05:15,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be listening to the rest that I didn't catch on the way down to Madcap.

1506
02:05:15,431 --> 02:05:20,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do because you're going to hear all about another dream game and that's how your name came up earlier in the show.

1507
02:05:20,914 --> 02:05:27,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So not that we – Yeah, I only noticed when I popped in and Matt mentioned it in chat and I'm like, uh-oh, what did I miss?

1508
02:05:27,529 --> 02:05:31,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out, the expectation is not that YYR is dream maker around here.

1509
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:34,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming is for everyone.

1510
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone has the capability to make an OLR wish come true.

1511
02:05:38,431 --> 02:05:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: This does not rest solely on the shoulders of YYR.

1512
02:05:42,172 --> 02:05:43,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to figure it out.

1513
02:05:43,912 --> 02:05:46,433
[SPEAKER_04]: This is probably what's going to happen when I do my Unity course.

1514
02:05:47,013 --> 02:05:50,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to do the Unity course for practicing UI elements.

1515
02:05:53,816 --> 02:05:55,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just be the guy on the internet that complains about it.

1516
02:05:55,738 --> 02:05:56,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1517
02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:00,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the sake of a prototyping position I want to work.

1518
02:06:01,284 --> 02:06:01,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, nice.

1519
02:06:02,986 --> 02:06:03,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Congrats on that.

1520
02:06:04,868 --> 02:06:05,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun.

1521
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:09,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a full report on MagFest when you come back.

1522
02:06:09,294 --> 02:06:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And get some sleep, goddammit.

1523
02:06:10,799 --> 02:06:11,600
[SPEAKER_11]: You will get one.

1524
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:14,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't promise anything on the latter, though.

1525
02:06:14,482 --> 02:06:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1526
02:06:14,682 --> 02:06:15,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good luck.

1527
02:06:15,543 --> 02:06:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1528
02:06:16,323 --> 02:06:16,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1529
02:06:16,764 --> 02:06:17,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Passing a sleep spell.

1530
02:06:17,985 --> 02:06:19,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You are getting sleepy.

1531
02:06:19,706 --> 02:06:20,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleepy.

1532
02:06:20,387 --> 02:06:21,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Please be well.

1533
02:06:21,267 --> 02:06:22,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of yourselves.

1534
02:06:22,548 --> 02:06:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1535
02:06:22,769 --> 02:06:23,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

1536
02:06:23,269 --> 02:06:24,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1537
02:06:25,734 --> 02:06:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a delight to hear from YYR here at Orange Launch Radio.

1538
02:06:28,796 --> 02:06:30,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we got to wrap up.

1539
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:32,720
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound issues and all that put us back.

1540
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's wrap it up.

1541
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:36,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you as always for tuning into our show and listening to us.

1542
02:06:37,283 --> 02:06:43,608
[SPEAKER_03]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1543
02:06:43,668 --> 02:06:44,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend or two.

1544
02:06:44,449 --> 02:06:50,113
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review on a site like Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, whatever it's called now, YouTube.

1545
02:06:50,454 --> 02:06:51,715
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that goes a very long way.

1546
02:06:51,755 --> 02:06:53,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for all of that.

1547
02:06:53,516 --> 02:06:55,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple Podcasts.

1548
02:06:55,837 --> 02:06:56,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Apple Podcasts.

1549
02:06:57,238 --> 02:06:59,860
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, let's get final thoughts tonight.

1550
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,801
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I'll start with you.

1551
02:07:01,841 --> 02:07:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thoughts tonight.

1552
02:07:03,562 --> 02:07:06,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm leaping into the abyss, as in playing dead by daylight.

1553
02:07:06,784 --> 02:07:07,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Pray for me.

1554
02:07:07,904 --> 02:07:08,144
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1555
02:07:08,425 --> 02:07:08,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

1556
02:07:08,745 --> 02:07:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1557
02:07:09,085 --> 02:07:13,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You are streaming tonight because tomorrow's a holiday, but not for you.

1558
02:07:13,327 --> 02:07:14,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss my Sunday stream.

1559
02:07:14,448 --> 02:07:14,668
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1560
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:15,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then go for it.

1561
02:07:15,529 --> 02:07:16,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in a minute.

1562
02:07:16,789 --> 02:07:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1563
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1564
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:18,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1565
02:07:19,491 --> 02:07:20,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll go to you.

1566
02:07:20,231 --> 02:07:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Your final thought.

1567
02:07:22,217 --> 02:07:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought is I'm still very busy this week trying to wrap everything up for the rest of this season of builds and my SOP for Minecraft.

1568
02:07:32,522 --> 02:07:34,102
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully see a video soon.

1569
02:07:35,623 --> 02:07:36,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1570
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:36,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1571
02:07:37,304 --> 02:07:40,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see my final thought.

1572
02:07:42,092 --> 02:07:42,953
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1573
02:08:04,827 --> 02:08:07,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Please use your critical thinking skills over the next four years.

1574
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:09,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very, very, very, very important.

1575
02:08:09,913 --> 02:08:10,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night, everybody.

1576
02:08:10,814 --> 02:08:13,957
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in seven days here on another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1577
02:08:14,478 --> 02:08:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye!

1578
02:08:27,472 --> 02:08:34,735

02:08:36,295 --> 02:08:45,899
