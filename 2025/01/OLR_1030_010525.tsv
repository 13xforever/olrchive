9867	11168	It's a new year, what else is new?
11268	13769	Maybe a new Minecraft not made under Microsoft's stewardship?
13909	20653	Well, no, it can't be called that since Notch doesn't own the name, and I doubt Microsoft will license it to someone else's work, but that link is inextricably present for him.
20833	25296	His next game is already being referred to as Minecraft 2, and his own tweets are not dissuading the connection either.
28197	28817	Happy New Year!
29078	34361	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about maybe new Minecraft and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34701	36662	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39380	42163	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42203	46028	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46188	55980	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with you all once again tonight, episode number 1030 of our show for tonight, January the 5th of 2025.
57722	58202	You can believe it?
58622	59063	New year.
59243	60203	New year, new me?
60663	61964	Nope, not here at OLR.
62044	64345	Same show you've come to expect.
65105	70488	But we're back to talk a little bit about what we hope to expect this year, and of course some of the gaming headlines.
70828	76110	I'm here, Rob Roberts, joined as always by the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
77311	77531	Hi.
77811	78351	Hello, hello.
78391	78932	How are you doing?
80052	80412	I'm okay.
80753	81613	Did you have a good New Year's?
83114	83734	It was alright.
83974	84174	Yeah?
84874	85515	Mine was very quiet.
85535	85755	I did.
88062	94930	Alicia came over and we drank and yeah, that was about it.
95592	97553	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
124850	126310	So I ended up having a pretty quiet night.
129791	130272	That's okay.
130412	134513	Staying up and playing video games all night is a perfectly acceptable plan for New Year's.
134993	137274	Maybe that was the plan for Techmaster Loki.
137474	137894	Hey, Loki.
141075	143696	Sort of, but I don't think we really did much.
144116	145976	Watched TV.
146136	146836	You just watched TV?
147837	148537	Yeah, pretty much.
149792	161856	Are you at that age where the kids kind of go to bed before or are you the kids at that age where they go to bed before midnight and you do like a nine o'clock East Coast thing or do they stay up at this point?
163537	164297	No, they stay up.
164697	172240	They've been going to the in-laws to go hang out and stay up over there.
173501	176442	Although my oldest this time, he's like, no, I don't want to do that.
176502	177402	I'm just gonna play games here.
179082	193829	I'm sure many gamers have seen that classic uh comic meme it's in like three panels and it's like gamer new years and it says 11 59 the person's gaming 12 o'clock and they're holding up a firework and then 1201 they're back to gaming I really feel it so that's that's basically where your kid is at now
194565	195786	Yeah, that's basically where he's at.
196146	197086	Okay.
197106	198907	He's with the rest of us, it sounds like.
199067	200187	So, good times.
200287	200607	Good times.
200847	205269	Well, I hope all of you out there had a great New Year, whatever you were doing to celebrate.
205869	211732	So, to start off the New Year here at Orange Launch Radio, I thought we would take a look back.
211872	212752	Y'all love this.
213212	218336	We're going to go back and take a look at our 2024 predictions.
218396	221358	And we're going to see what came true and what didn't.
221478	231044	And then, because we're gluttons for punishment, we're going to make our 2025 predictions, which I will fully admit, I forgot to think about before tonight's show.
231104	232465	So I'm going to think of them as we go.
232505	233566	Even after you reminded us.
233586	233906	I know.
234026	236628	Even after I said a reminder to everybody else, we're doing predictions tonight.
236888	238649	Then I went out on a walk and I was like, yeah.
238669	239169	How dare.
239530	239710	Yeah.
239930	240210	Anyway.
240230	241751	That's okay.
241931	242832	I kind of thought about it.
243420	245402	Well, this is where you all in chat help us.
245462	257810	You can give us inspiration because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific on Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
257850	261432	And I don't care if there's some silly award show on TV.
262253	262833	We're here.
263273	265514	So check us out, which I believe is the case tonight.
265534	268214	There's a silly award show on TV, but it doesn't matter.
268294	269635	We're still going to be doing our thing, of course.
270055	271315	So let's talk about predictions.
271455	271815	All right.
271875	273375	Who's ready to revisit 2024?
273876	276096	Who's afraid to revisit 2024?
278177	278637	Here we go.
279517	279977	I don't know.
282277	284358	Do any of you think you got any right?
285017	286538	I don't even remember what I said.
309261	309621	Did it?
310601	310862	No.
311362	312562	It did not.
313402	315083	Okay, so there's a first song.
315543	318404	So you had a Kickstarter that did not release on Steam.
318444	318704	All right.
320005	332889	Matt, your first one was Bobby Kotek becomes the CEO of a different gaming or gaming adjacent company, which looks to be incorrect.
334370	335130	And thank heavens.
335670	336971	Let's be thankful, Matt.
337011	337191	Let's...
338086	340528	But yeah, it's good they didn't.
340568	341708	Let's be thankful on that one.
341788	342689	Okay, I think we're all relieved.
343089	351815	Then my first prediction was two launch window titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games, and one of them is Sea of Thieves.
352275	353056	Well, guess what?
353376	356918	We didn't fucking get the Switch 2 this year, so that's a big eh there.
356978	362182	And unfortunately, that simple little fact really fucked a few of our predictions.
362782	365564	I think many of us were expecting the Switch 2 this year.
366145	366805	Didn't happen.
367005	372249	And so that, you know, I could literally copy-paste that into next year's predictions.
372289	374410	I'm not going to do that, I don't think.
374751	379534	But, you know, I still feel like that one may hold some weight just a few months late.
379934	380475	Okay, um...
381519	389583	Jamie, your second prediction was E3 announces another metamorphosis, which I don't believe is correct either.
389643	394726	I don't believe E3 really... It metamorphosized into jack shit.
394826	400129	It metamorphosized into six feet underground, so E3's... So I was right.
401289	402270	I don't know about that.
402290	403210	I don't think so.
403250	404211	I don't think so.
405270	432234	judges bong okay uh metamorphosized into deceased metamorphosized into death all right uh Matt your second one was death is a metamorphosis all right uh oh here we go oh this is the minute these words leave my mouth they're gonna be like big x the switch successor is announced by March wrong year you know what you didn't say the year that's true I did not say the year
434471	436211	Or at least if you did, I didn't write it down.
436592	440773	You said Switch successor announced by March, Prime 4.
441393	443953	So you said Prime 4, which is an easy one to call, let's be real.
444313	448915	And Odyssey, I'm guessing a sequel to Odyssey or something, releases 2025.
450335	451155	Oh, okay, that was it.
451215	453076	So you said that Odyssey would be a game for 2025.
454216	458277	So again, this feels like one of those, like,
458957	467943	Honestly, I'm going to keep this file open because I feel like we might want to revisit some of these and just see where the vibes were delayed a little bit.
467963	469384	Just off by a year, it's fine.
469424	473046	Yeah, just off a little bit, that's all.
473987	477449	My second prediction, I'm not sure if this happened or not.
477550	479411	I think it might have, but here we go.
480111	488237	A AAA game gets exposed for way overuse of AI and it causes the game to absolutely tank.
489079	494562	and my question is did that quadruple A game did that get caught using AI?
496403	496784	Which one?
497164	499746	The quadruple A game that Ubisoft put out.
500006	500606	Star Wars?
500946	501587	No, no.
501947	505909	Remember that pirate game that they put out that they were saying was a quadruple A title?
507750	508551	No, I don't think it had AI.
508871	509992	It was just terrible.
510272	510592	Damn.
511172	512433	I thought I might have that one.
514114	515575	No, it wasn't AI.
515595	515675	Um
519332	521433	I think that's intentionally wrong on purpose.
543499	561802	Alright, yeah, I don't think I would give myself credit for this one, because in my mind, I'm just gonna be honest, in my mind, I was envisioning that there would be a whole, like, cancellation on social media, where, look at this, we've determined that, like, kind of what happened to Palworld and Pokemon, where, like, somebody goes in and...
562142	564303	and OrangeRite in chat says FoamStars had the AI.
564363	567425	Yes, they did, but that actually wasn't a 2024 game either.
567685	568706	We knew about that one already.
569226	571948	And that wasn't the reason it failed.
572808	576370	Which, by the way, that game did... I think they got rid of their...
578379	598372	I don't know it was going multiple platforms I know Foam Stars was like evolving they're not shutting it down but it's like here's our last hurrah basically happening on the Foam Stars front which again I remember I played that game on stream because Shane bullied me into doing it and actually it really wasn't that bad the AI art aside which was bad but they realized that mistake real quick for what it's worth
599482	618264	alright so let's go to the last predictions which were from Jamie said bigger push in VR and spatial environments in and outside the gaming industry this was kind of muddy to me I don't know Jamie what do you think be on your honor did you get this one
619551	620231	There were pushes.
620271	621212	There definitely were pushes.
621832	623332	There were also setbacks.
623932	624293	Yeah.
624473	625993	Some things I cannot discuss.
626273	626453	Sure.
626733	626893	Sure.
626933	627394	I understand.
628514	635416	But I think that it stayed fairly steady with new games coming out.
635476	637597	So I think it was more of a slow progression.
637777	637977	Mm-hmm.
639409	647031	and definitely there was experimentation done in the world of virtual environments.
647231	657433	And there are still a lot of AR tools out there too, like the image scan, you know, taking the picture, converting it to 3D using AI.
658073	660273	You know, there's still those tools out there.
660633	667895	There's FaceSwap, I think got an update, not FaceSwap, but the 3D face mapping software.
669677	671218	Got a big update.
671979	675821	So, I think on a technical level, yes.
676842	679924	But, of course, for every step forward, you've got steps backwards.
680384	680605	So...
681924	704642	Um, and you know, I am thinking about there was a story that I had on our shortlist that I ended up not putting in tonight, but it had to do with Steam stats and I think part of I had a hard time following in the story where they were getting the stats from, but it was talking about how the Oculus or VR in general on Steam has been growing, but it's not because of the US is because of China.
705422	707323	that VR usage has really been growing.
707363	719432	And I think that's kind of one of those things that, you know, for all the prediction and all the talk on VR and where's it going to go, what's it going to do, I think that's one of the things that has not really been in the immediate vision.
719472	722013	It's kind of like, oh, yeah, that's a big factor.
722153	723494	And that is China.
723975	730999	What happens in other large markets with VR and how might that influence what happens on the world scale?
731520	733081	So I thought that was interesting.
734121	737342	Again, was it really what you were envisioning at the start of 2024?
737422	737862	Probably not.
739403	741363	It's not far off.
742303	743444	But VR is not dead.
744244	746184	And I think that's an important part of it.
747665	754987	There's other applications that are... How am I trying to phrase this?
755467	757407	There are other applications being discovered.
758188	762209	But it's not going to happen as quickly as I would have hoped.
763305	771870	For some of that, I think that it's more of the market's not ready for what is possible.
773091	778114	You know what comes to mind that I do think qualifies under this, actually?
778194	780396	Because you know I follow a lot of Niantic stuff.
780976	784939	And we did have a big story a couple weeks ago, or actually a couple months ago.
785499	789722	And they also launched this tool, you know, they had bought this thing called Scanniverse.
790242	790742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
810410	811451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
830253	831574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
852851	871028	is that that yes that is a big push from Niantic to get into spatial environments especially outside the gaming industry really trying to look at predictive what is happening in the world what is happening you know beyond just what you see in games so just a thought that kind of like just went off in my mind as we were talking that that was a big big story from a
873946	891708	and there are already other attempts though just for standard like I know Google Street View was doing like museum walks and things like that not quite of course the same thing but I could certainly see how
894750	905098	That augmented reality and 3D scanning and building virtual environments may replace things that are normally camera-based.
905478	912663	Yeah, I will say the scans that you get out of the scan... Because I've messed around with the Scannerverse application, and it's really good.
912683	915265	And the scans you get out of it look really incredible.
915866	918788	I'm actually trying to see if there's something on stream I can actually show.
918828	921030	I just don't want to dox myself, so I'm picking something...
921570	922751	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
943499	943939	So, kind of neat.
972625	986395	Alright, moving on to Loki I'm gonna have to check this out, it looks pretty cool Oh yeah, the Scannaverse thing's cool Anyway, so Loki, this may be, you may have got this one I think I would give you a point for this one, you ready?
986875	997723	Here it is, your last prediction was The Minecraft movie trailer sucks Congratulations, you got it At least that first preview did
999021	1000442	The first one, yes.
1000502	1004824	The second one... It got better, but the first preview was pretty bad.
1004844	1006205	It's alright.
1007305	1008146	I would give you that one.
1008306	1009026	I would give you that one.
1011581	1013883	And then, oh man, my last one.
1014103	1015704	Y'all are going to scream.
1015945	1018006	It's so close, but I didn't get it.
1018066	1018486	You ready?
1019347	1026592	My last prediction was the game of the year 2024 at the Game Awards is an indie game.
1028133	1029915	Oh, that was so close.
1030935	1037400	Because there was one, Bellatro was definitely in conversation and was at a lot of the front of people's minds.
1037460	1039581	I think that was plausible.
1040509	1047493	I'm going to give myself the plausible participation trophy on that one because it was really darn close.
1047573	1050635	But as we know, Astro Bot actually won the award.
1051495	1053176	So there's that.
1053897	1054177	All right.
1055257	1061381	Are we ready to – so when all is said and done, it's like one and a half.
1063042	1063922	Good job, everybody.
1064403	1064843	One and a half.
1066542	1070243	Curse Nintendo for not releasing.
1070263	1070863	Dang it, Nintendo.
1071083	1071744	I know, right?
1071944	1072604	Ruin everything.
1073584	1075765	Alright, now we're going to get into 2025.
1076625	1085927	And again, I want to encourage all of you in chat to play along if you have some good predictions you want to throw your hat in the ring this year.
1086888	1090729	Let's look at our 2025 predictions.
1091889	1093189	Jamie, I'll start with you.
1093710	1095090	You have something you want to mention.
1097033	1103558	Um, so yeah, my first one is going to be, Ikea has a collaboration with a major gaming company.
1105519	1106780	They are collaborating more.
1112246	1132356	um uh and this actually come from me looking for uh furniture for myself and finally they had a whole gaming series and I had a partnership with Lego and uh Republic of Gaming and like all kinds of things and I was like oh there's gonna be an official collaboration before too long so
1133416	1134317	I'm going to throw that out there.
1134657	1137458	Ikea has a collaboration with a major gaming company.
1138058	1142320	Especially when you think about things like Minecraft would be such an obvious one, right?
1142421	1148503	Or those types of world building sorts of things that are very adjacent to Lego, right?
1149124	1150784	So we'll see, we'll see.
1151485	1154026	All right, Loki, what do you want to go with for your first one?
1155999	1159142	Okay, this is going to give you the mindset of where I'm at this year.
1160183	1163707	The Skibbity Toilet movie shocks all in its absolute cinema.
1166270	1166510	What?
1168413	1169714	It's absolute cinema.
1169734	1172577	I don't know what the fuck that has to do with gaming, Loki, but fine.
1173098	1176481	It has the Half-Life assets in it, therefore it's gaming.
1177082	1182006	And technically it's in Fortnite, so it is gaming now.
1183007	1183768	All right, fine.
1184289	1186191	The Skivity Toilet movie shocks cinema.
1186471	1190635	Are we talking like it's, I don't know, what's the movie they're talking about for Oscars this year?
1190695	1191075	Wicked?
1191196	1192377	Is it Wicked Part 1 good?
1193325	1197966	It's not Wicked Part 1 good, but it's definitely Megalopolis.
1199106	1202527	It's better than that, which was Absolute Cinema, so you know.
1203967	1205047	Okay.
1206328	1216950	I'm going to go with my first prediction, and I'm going to say Nintendo shocks all by having enough Switch 2 stock.
1219218	1221138	I think we're going to avoid a Nintendo shortage.
1221218	1222619	I'm going to be bold on this one.
1222719	1229080	I think there has been so much lead time towards this console and we see so much is getting out early about it.
1229480	1232660	I think Nintendo is going to shock everybody by having enough Switch 2 stock.
1233501	1238842	I think there'll be a lot of people ordering online and things like that.
1238862	1239642	A lot of that stuff.
1239882	1243442	I think they're going to have relatively enough Switch 2 stock.
1244823	1245443	I think it'll...
1246443	1270580	it'll still be maybe a little bit I don't think we're going to see the shortages we've seen with any other platform in quite some time so we'll see though I could be wrong but that's you know I'm willing to put some predictions out there that are that are risky so there you go that's my first one all right Jamie we're over to you for number two Ubisoft is put up for sale oh you're really adjacent to something I want to say I'm still going to say it
1271702	1273603	GreatMindsThink
1301013	1321091	think like that well I stole that from Becky oh okay well fine great minds think like us all right and who thinks like us huh damn few right well I thought that was the rest all right that's that's that's a who's like us that's like a different thing all right all right uh Loki what's your number two prediction
1322029	1328417	My number two prediction is that Microsoft will announce a portable console this year.
1328537	1337528	And by portable console, I mean a handheld PC device, kind of like a Steam Deck, that is meant for their cloud streaming.
1340765	1344866	Yep, I think that's an extremely safe prediction in some ways.
1344906	1353768	I mean, you know, we don't know if it'll happen this year, but I feel like, yeah, I think there's a lot of tea leaves that are showing that Microsoft's going to go that direction for sure.
1353968	1355149	So, yeah, it makes sense.
1356269	1361170	And so that brings me to my next prediction, which I said it was going to be really close to what Jamie said.
1361690	1364151	Yves Gamont defeated.
1365660	1365920	DarkSakura
1396738	1397318	Last prediction.
1397759	1410888	I'm trying to think how to phrase this because I think that TikTok is going to become a subsidy of its original parent company and be licensed to Twitch.
1412369	1414450	So that it can continue operating in the US.
1416732	1419094	That would mean Amazon buys TikTok, essentially.
1420034	1420775	They wouldn't be buying.
1422443	1423624	Excuse me, licensed.
1424265	1425026	Interesting.
1425686	1430050	This whole TikTok thing is going to be very interesting to see how that turns out.
1430891	1434534	It's going to be a chunk of the economy affected.
1434794	1435915	I don't
1438448	1439769	I could go on a whole thing on this.
1440529	1441550	I watch a lot of TikTok.
1441570	1442170	There's so much.
1442750	1443091	I do.
1443111	1445432	I finally fell down that rabbit hole of TikTok hard.
1445612	1447093	Like three years ago, I would have been that.
1447153	1449854	And I know I've been that guy saying, what's a tech tech?
1450094	1450935	You know, that type of thing.
1450955	1453596	But no, I don't know what it was in the last couple of years.
1453676	1455137	I fell down TikTok hard.
1455397	1457218	I went viral on TikTok this year for the first time.
1457258	1457538	Remember?
1458419	1459659	My one went viral.
1459679	1460220	Got like 100,000 likes or whatever.
1460240	1460280	So...
1462921	1468084	But yeah, and I haven't made a TikTok since because the bar of expectation is too great now.
1468524	1470825	But I'm shocked.
1471425	1473966	I didn't think we were the country that shut things down.
1474367	1476848	I didn't think we were the country that censored things.
1477368	1480830	And I understand people are saying there's a risk, there's a real risk.
1481130	1486593	You need to be more transparent about what that risk is because do we trust the government?
1487373	1488534	No, we sure don't.
1489014	1492116	I also don't trust other people in this country because look who they elected.
1492597	1492977	Exactly.
1493037	1495278	And I don't care if it's Democrats or Republicans leading this.
1495379	1497820	I don't trust any of them right now, to be quite honest.
1497840	1507707	So why be surprised though about censorship in this country when our entire country was founded off of puritanical and extremist religious belief?
1509847	1517190	Oh yeah, no, I just, I thought at the end of the day we would be better than that, and here we are.
1517490	1518270	It's disappointing.
1518751	1520811	I can be disappointed and still not be surprised.
1521432	1522752	I had to explain that elsewhere.
1522772	1523933	Yeah, exactly.
1524253	1526334	I can be not surprised, but still be disappointed.
1527414	1532956	Not to mention, though, I mean, I could also, I was either gonna say that, or I had another...
1536232	1547588	a mention that I could have done instead but it would have had me going a lot more ranty and a lot more political because I was going to say that the gaming industry tanks due to policy changes but
1550572	1552493	I don't know if the... Someone wants to steal that one.
1552973	1553574	Yeah, we'll see.
1554694	1556715	DJ Ranma S says the TikTok risk is there.
1556795	1560958	It's been there for years, but no one listens to IT people when it comes to applications or security risks.
1561038	1564780	Okay, be more transparent and specific.
1565220	1567021	What are those risks?
1567521	1569222	Because... They've been outlined before.
1569422	1571744	Well, all I'm hearing is that China has your data.
1572084	1572744	Well, you know what?
1573745	1575846	I don't fucking trust Elon Musk with my data.
1576126	1577307	Why does he get special treatment?
1577887	1581690	I think there's a lot of people I don't trust with my data, but somehow seems to get it anyway.
1582610	1593358	But I'm talking, and I get that IT professionals are saying these things, but again, I don't see what the risk is that we are already giving to other companies I don't trust.
1594395	1603939	The concern has to do with access by Chinese government, because since Chinese government pretty much has their fingers in every company and industry, there is that.
1603999	1606900	And the app does gather data, gathers lots of personal data.
1608160	1618804	The Chinese national security laws basically say that any foreign and domestic firms that operate within their country must share their data with the government upon request.
1619665	1643426	and especially given trade agreements and now these new sanctions coming up that's going to cause a pretty big conflict and as far as what basically the Chinese government is going to have access to for standard usage in America personal data uh purchasing history I mean because there's the TikTok shop and everything um they say that they store their data in the U.S.
1644407	1655602	but they did also acknowledge that some non-US employees have access to US user data and there was also that BuzzFeed leak that uh
1656952	1676262	there's a company called ByteDance has access to things like phone numbers, birthdays of American TikTok users so it's quite a that's just over the top
1676682	1677202	part of it.
1677383	1680144	So yeah, I had to remember what the company was.
1680224	1692072	Again, I don't know what has to be done, but if TikTok is banned, then I immediately want to see at least a ballot initiative in this state started to ban X. Why should X be allowed to operate?
1692432	1695674	Elon Musk is trying to put his fingers in so many international pies.
1695994	1697415	He's trying to influence German elections.
1697455	1699316	He's trying to influence now what's happening in the UK.
1699376	1699897	He's telling them to...
1701377	1727887	Disassembled Parliament or whatever the fuck he's doing like that individual is more actively dangerous in so many ways so I just I do not understand why X is allowed to operate the way it is but TikTok isn't and the other the other thing too is that what someone might think is innocent data being acquired by another company any data any information is power yeah
1728843	1740216	and you can use it to track trends, to track commercial viability, to track communication standards, to test other security measures.
1740917	1749407	There's a lot involved in the technology behind data gathering like that that the average person doesn't think about.
1750780	1766441	and so it's a matter of okay well I don't care about my stuff but you're only thinking about yourself right there you're not thinking about the big picture at the same time I don't want to see it banned you know
1768368	1772249	If we're all about the free market or whatever, then be very transparent with that information.
1772349	1773730	Let the free market decide or whatever.
1774250	1783252	But I do think, and I just, you know, the one other vent I want to get off my chest is that this is that, you know, and I'm sorry to get political, but I have to.
1783652	1792635	The way, like, for Democrats to not be much more transparent in their messaging about why they're pushing so fucking hard for a TikTok ban.
1793115	1796017	and now Trump is looking like he's coming in as a superhero.
1796077	1797938	Oh, I'm the one that doesn't want to ban TikTok.
1797978	1798758	I'm trying to put a stop to it.
1798778	1801439	This is terrible, terrible messaging.
1801880	1803681	This is why Democrats are losing elections.
1804121	1814166	Democrats are looking like the bad guys in this TikTok shutdown because they're not being more transparent or at least they are failing in their ability to message the why this is so important.
1814226	1819269	They are absolutely failing in that messaging and this is something and you all know how I feel about the man.
1819649	1821950	This is something that Trump is doing a much better job on.
1822190	1850645	and I can't stand that I'm saying this but it's true it's all about and if the last election has taught us anything it is and here's how I tie it back to the game industry facts don't fucking matter perception does no one cares about facts and just to point this out here anything you present as fact that is unsubstantiated is really an opinion
1851678	1853459	And SSJ100Matt, exactly.
1853519	1855679	He was pushing for TikTok to be banned in the beginning.
1855839	1858620	That is absolutely 100% verifiably accurate.
1858900	1860001	But the truth doesn't matter.
1860541	1861241	Also accurate.
1862201	1867843	I think in this case, some advisor sat him down and gave him a talking to.
1869044	1870144	A grown-up talking to.
1872751	1873352	Anyway, all right.
1873732	1874652	Enough of the TikToks.
1875073	1875513	Disgusting.
1875553	1877435	But obviously... But anyway, that's my prediction.
1877515	1878095	No, yeah, fair.
1878135	1879176	And this is literally two weeks away.
1879196	1879756	They find a way around it.
1879876	1880817	Literally two weeks away.
1880937	1882218	We may not have TikTok in two weeks.
1883239	1889364	You know, there's talks about VPN and other ways, but it's, you know, for the most part, it's quite... Let's be real.
1889724	1892206	Most people aren't going to bother with all that shit for TikTok.
1892786	1893347	And that's too bad.
1894567	1894828	All right.
1896209	1897510	Back to gaming predictions.
1898766	1927666	but TikTok's huge for gaming so you know uh Loki I finally got invited to TikTok live and I'm like hell a little late don't you I think my one my one thing that went viral I think you just have to get so many views and eventually it happens so all right uh Loki your last prediction um I guess I mean that's more of a safe prediction I guess um
1930709	1934072	The US tariffs drive console prices up another $100.
1934433	1945564	Okay, so due to tariff laws, console prices go up $100.
1947506	1949948	That's essentially what you're saying, right?
1950369	1951350	I don't think it's just that.
1951870	1953992	I think that it's... Could be closer to $200.
1955658	1957158	No, I'm not even saying that for consoles.
1957198	1961379	I'm saying every piece of gaming software hardware goes up in price.
1962700	1966420	SG100Matt says, I would have expected a Grand Theft Auto 6 prediction from Loki.
1967601	1969161	Eh, I don't care at this point.
1969241	1971702	Like, they've taken too long to announce their stuff.
1972042	1973462	Their trailer came out over a year ago.
1973502	1974442	They had time to do it.
1974902	1979604	They can do it when they're ready to announce their thing.
1979924	1980264	Whatever.
1981104	1981484	I'll wait.
1982560	1998437	Alright, my last prediction is going to be very similar to what I said last year, but I am going to change it and I am going to say no Microsoft AAA title is exclusive to Windows Xbox.
1999301	2003184	Meaning they're going to release them on Switch or they're going to release them on PlayStation.
2003564	2007767	No Microsoft AAA title ends up actually being exclusive to Microsoft.
2008227	2009348	That is the prediction I'm making.
2009948	2011749	And again, I think that's one of the things we've seen.
2011829	2014431	Some things kind of indicating that direction could be.
2014771	2015872	be happening and what have you.
2016032	2023516	I think there are other ways Microsoft will try to drive people to their ecosystems, such as like the best version of their game or what have you.
2023556	2030480	But I think Microsoft, so I'm sort of leaning into what I said last year about the Switch successor and Microsoft having launched titles on that.
2030640	2038384	I believe that's still going to be true, but I'm going to just add to it that no Microsoft AAA title is actually exclusive to Windows and Xbox.
2038744	2043787	I think you're going to see a ton of them on Nintendo, and I think where it matters, they're going to show up on PlayStation as well.
2045468	2046649	That is my last prediction.
2046709	2047390	Let's recap.
2047450	2049332	Here are our 2025 predictions.
2050153	2052796	IKEA, major collaboration with a major gaming company.
2053416	2055298	Skibbity Toilet Movie, Shock Cinema.
2056437	2063161	Nintendo, I guess I need to add to that by being good because otherwise that's too much room for interpretation when we come back to this.
2064061	2066863	Nintendo shocks all by having enough Switch 2 stock.
2067583	2068864	Ubisoft is put up for sale.
2069524	2073366	Microsoft announces portable console, handheld PC device meant for cloud streaming.
2074006	2074987	Yves Guillemot defeated.
2075607	2078269	TikTok subsidy of parent company licensed to Twitch.
2079195	2080176	I really like that one.
2080236	2081256	I hope that actually is true.
2081777	2082017	U.S.
2082077	2089841	tariffs up console prices $100 and no Microsoft AAA title is exclusive to Windows or Xbox.
2090322	2091783	Put them in the vault, lock them down.
2092323	2095345	There they are, your 2025 predictions.
2096205	2097946	All right, let's talk.
2097986	2100188	So some of you were asking last week,
2101095	2106861	What might the OLR hosts game of the year for this year actually look like?
2107341	2110124	So I would like to invite my co-hosts and I'll share as well.
2110685	2114409	What are your games of the year?
2114569	2115530	So let's start.
2115570	2117392	We'll go to Matt with this one to start off.
2117612	2118793	Matt, what's your 2024 game of the year?
2120180	2120981	My game of the year?
2122763	2124325	I have multiple games, I guess.
2125046	2125546	I don't know.
2126087	2129271	I mean, Minecraft still, obviously, still playing that.
2131333	2137320	I would say the two other ones that stood out for me the most would have been Bull Altru.
2137581	2140184	I think it's been a really great game.
2141325	2164873	um a lot of fun to play and then one like I just couldn't stop talking about when I was playing it that came out the beginning of the year um would have to be oh gosh and then now of course it disappears out of my brain um it would have to be oh god I forgot the name of it uh
2166072	2166753	Let's see.
2167655	2168536	Oh, come back to me.
2168556	2169658	Left Elastic Impression.
2169898	2170359	I'm just kidding.
2170940	2174265	No, it's just my old brain being that way.
2178619	2179380	Turbo Kid
2206092	2207674	DarkSakura, what was your game of the year?
2222873	2224934	I'm going to say Dragon Age, Veilguard.
2225254	2233578	There's still a lot of stuff I don't really care about it, you know, that I think could have been a lot better, but I've had a lot of fucking fun playing it.
2234679	2242083	And I mean, I've of course played so much Dead by Daylight, it's always being updated, so I'm going to include the Debbies.
2243644	2247706	And... Yeah.
2248766	2250147	I think that's going to be...
2252079	2253059	Be my two.
2254339	2254720	Fair enough.
2256140	2262881	My game of the year, I kind of went a little bit of a different direction just because I think there are games I could have named my game of the year.
2263561	2265082	There's things that I've really enjoyed.
2265142	2268262	I think Diablo 4's expansion really put the game in a great place.
2268302	2270603	And for me, I've sunk a lot of hours into that game.
2271363	2274623	I guess you could say the Warcraft expansion was pretty good too.
2275203	2277544	Certainly a lot of people have enjoyed Final Fantasy Rebirth.
2278865	2284990	I guess I could say Bellatro, but the reality is I did not click with that game I think the way everybody else did.
2285271	2286492	Just different strokes for different folks.
2286912	2288514	I love that it's doing so great.
2288614	2291336	I love that it's bringing some indie attention and all that stuff.
2291777	2296321	But I just have to say, I wouldn't feel right saying, oh, that's my favorite game of the year.
2297221	2319258	and then you know I was talking about last week I think if I really really like had to pick one thing I would probably say you know that Pokemon trading card pocket game is so smart I think in many ways it ought to be recognized for just like what a strong and kind of unique sort of release it is to bring a lot of attention to mobile gaming but I
2320253	2331003	The actual thing I want to say for my game of the year because the thing I actually thought about was, you know, kind of everything that we've kind of dealt with in 2024 when it comes to, you know, we've had so many layoffs in the industry.
2331404	2334466	We've seen so much BS that's been going on behind the scenes.
2334506	2341353	We've seen so many, you know, rich people getting richer and people on the front lines that are working hard on these games getting laid off.
2341793	2356905	and we've seen, you know, a lot of teases for new consoles that don't end up actually coming and, you know, a lot of promises that feel like they're not delivered on and this is my long fancy way of saying my official game of the year for 2024 is nothing.
2357765	2358626	That's my game of the year.
2359307	2359647	Nothing.
2363865	2391570	2024 has been kind of a very hard year to be a gaming fan in many ways and I'm not saying that every game release was bad or especially in the smaller developed and indie teams there aren't things that are worth recognition but I kind of want to use this time to highlight a lot of bullshit that has happened in this industry and a lot of you know big companies just getting bigger eating them up big fish eating bigger fish and just all this crap that's happening
2392730	2420398	it's really a year that feels like in many ways a setback for the industry so I don't think it deserves a game of the year and that's my final answer many people in chat are saying Astro Bot I just actually did not get around to Astro Bot I'm sure it's great I'd love to check it out at some point but even if it was the best thing I've ever played it's not really going to change how I feel about this year as a whole
2422722	2424124	DarkSakura DarkSakura
2439495	2468419	um I played Dead by Daylight I have played Fruit Mountain which I'm kind of addicted to um I also oh crap what else was I playing um I'm just gonna leave it at that that's what I was playing cause I don't know I've had so much going on that I'm a little bit like oh yeah and I played Palia that was the other one
2470595	2470795	All right.
2471676	2472658	Well, then we'll go to Loki.
2472678	2474400	How was your game of the week?
2475181	2475882	Pretty packed.
2476162	2483090	I made it a point to try to play some of these games that I had recently picked up or been gifted.
2483291	2489298	So I did get a chance to play some Dungeon Klar, and that was pretty fun.
2489758	2489779	I
2490799	2513831	had a lot of fun with that it's kind of a roguelike thing where you you know pick up abilities inside of a claw machine they have different abilities that affect you know how the claw machine works and all that and the stuff that you pick up and how much damage it does and so I think that was a pretty easy to understand and pick up and play Peglin I tried that a bit I do like Peggle quite a bit um
2514602	2515302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2537628	2538389	Thank you for watching!
2555040	2561981	But yeah, I think sometimes like a tutorial or something like that is a little bit more helpful to kind of get you into all of that.
2563002	2565922	And then, of course, I played a lot of Bellaltro this week as well.
2566062	2571743	Just been getting at least a round in each day, both mobile and on PC.
2571803	2572684	And it's been a lot of fun.
2572764	2582586	And then, of course, the thing I've been working on the most, because I have a few more days off this week, has been my final builds in our season.
2582646	2584426	Technically, our season is...
2586289	2609335	over at the end of this month I mean we were going to end at the end of the year but we gave ourselves an extra like a couple weeks or so and then I think we're starting the new season on middle of February but I've been just working hard to get everything done I think I have all the redstone done for the ride for the most part and there's a few things like with audio and stuff that I have to do um
2611618	2626206	But all the major stuff is done now for the ride and so I'm probably to a point where I can finally start building it again on our survival server and collecting all the resources for that because there's a lot of stuff that I need for that.
2626746	2628307	It'll be really big.
2628687	2632670	And then I have a couple of the other supporting cast that have been helping me out with...
2633470	2660885	building other sections of the park so one's like a Wild West section that Fish and Suits has been working on and I brought in a roller coaster for my first SMP in there and then our other supporting cast member Oliver is working on this big ice section he's got this enormous cathedral made of ice and stuff over there with like an ice boat race or something that's going to be in there so
2662583	2669313	The park is going to double in size by the time... Well, more than double in size by the time it's all done.
2669633	2671035	It's just a matter of getting it built.
2672096	2696247	so hopefully very soon I've been saying that for weeks now because it's been just taking forever but I think we're getting to a point where it's almost actually done nice art takes time all right uh my gaming week uh so I've been playing more World of Warcraft uh my Paladins level 80 and I've been kind of enjoying what all goes on in the end game and all of that stuff I've been playing a little bit of that
2697308	2716725	and then I on Steam I checked out Questmaster that was the game that Loki dropped into my account last week so I fired that up on Steam Deck and it's it's neat so this is basically like it's it's Zelda maker basically legally distinct Zelda maker is what this game is okay so
2717986	2733446	and it's by Apogee which I thought was also very interesting because I was like I haven't seen their name on a game in a very long time but I guess maybe they're helping to publish some indie titles now I did enjoy the game I played one of the levels that I guess was random generated there's like a sign post in the town that you can use to access levels and I
2733866	2756253	I took the one that it gave me but here's the problem the game is still early access and the tutorial and setup part I think is the part they're still trying to finish because I feel like the town you start in feels like what there's there's nothing really happening here there's like a gamble thing and one other like a ring identifier or something like that but otherwise in that first little town you kind of really end up going nowhere
2756653	2762096	and I was looking at the roadmap for the game and it sounds like earlier this year they are going to finish a fully fledged tutorial which is great.
2762496	2776903	I was able to figure most things out in the dungeon that I ended up doing randomly but I wasn't able to beat it because I think there's just some mechanic I didn't understand that might be in the game's rules that because there's not really a fleshed out tutorial I couldn't understand it yet.
2777023	2783387	So at this point I kind of go well the game's not done but I also go but...
2784307	2785468	It is early access.
2786128	2787589	That is exactly what is advertised.
2787609	2788489	The games are not done.
2788869	2791190	So I can't sit here and say it's bad or anything.
2791230	2796633	But all I can say is that if you buy it now, be prepared that you have to do a little bit of your own research and figure some things out.
2797013	2803436	You might have to... And one thing that would have helped me, to be fair, I probably should have just gone into the builder and start seeing what all was available there.
2803536	2810139	And that probably would have helped explain to me what some of the mechanics and different things are and why I got stuck in the level I got stuck in and all that good stuff.
2810199	2810339	So...
2812270	2813832	I'll check it out again for sure.
2814193	2819601	It's one of those things I'll kind of like, I'm going to keep an eye on this while this game continues to develop.
2819641	2820763	I think it'll be that kind of thing.
2820803	2824970	I'm going to kind of keep an eye on it, but ultimately we'll see where it ends up.
2826055	2830798	All right, let's move on because that's really all I have for my gaming week.
2830818	2832999	I don't have a lot else to share, to be honest.
2833139	2836021	Otherwise, it's been some of the same old things I've been playing.
2836061	2840584	Oh, no, actually, one other thing I should mention for sure because I was streaming it on my personal channel.
2840904	2843186	I've been getting into doing retro games and trying to beat them.
2843606	2845447	I actually streamed a good chunk of The Guardian Legend.
2845847	2847508	I was like, we're going to start this year off with a bang.
2847548	2848649	Let's do The Guardian Legend.
2848989	2854153	I got through, I think, about half the game on my first stream because I'm up to like quarter or six.
2855033	2856233	It's not bad.
2881061	2882601	Half Bullet Hell Shooter.
2883141	2883962	That's really what it is.
2884062	2889142	And the same weapons you get in the Zelda mode, you end up using in Bullet Shooter mode and vice versa.
2889202	2890323	It was really ahead of its time.
2890863	2898344	I actually had one person that came in from my Blue Sky that said, oh, wow, I wonder if I have this game in my collection and I've never played it.
2898644	2901505	And sure enough, he put a follow-up post about an hour later.
2901545	2905985	He's like, this cartridge was in my collection and somehow I have completely missed this game.
2906545	2909206	Because I would bet a lot of people fire it up
2910006	2936459	play that first stage and they go oh and they cry or they go oh it's a shooter game not really my kind of thing and they put it away and they don't know they just cry or they cry from the difficulty I don't actually don't I think like especially when I was playing through it there were parts where it was like okay I need more shields or not there was a mini boss that was tearing me up and like I could not get it until I had enough shields and
2937019	2943064	and I found just the right secondary weapon to use against it when I was finally able to get it.
2943685	2946187	So, you know, I would say there's still some difficulty in there.
2946607	2953893	But, you know, if you explore every nook and cranny and make sure you get all your power-ups, I think you can kind of stay on top of the difficulty curve.
2954654	2955515	Well, we'll see.
2955595	2957096	I haven't finished the game on stream yet.
2957596	2960199	I was going to do it on Friday, but I ended up having an IRL thing.
2960219	2964542	And I have an IRL thing on Monday, so I'm hoping maybe Tuesday I can hop back on and finish it up.
2964842	2964983	So...
2966964	2993849	Except Tuesday now I may end up being out of town for work But we'll see, I think I'll be here So Tuesday I will end up playing that But yeah, Guardian Legend, a good old classic And I knew Jamie could appreciate that Because she has a fondness for that game too It's my favorite game I am no longer any good at it I'm going to put that right now You might be, when was the last time I mean, I guess I remember you playing it on stream It was a while ago But I remember you playing it on stream
2994764	2995564	I don't think I ever have.
2995785	2996045	Really?
2996245	3003569	I played it at home, and since I was playing it on my TV, I had some bad input lag.
3005270	3009072	And maybe it was that I tried to play it using Capture.
3010740	3031959	and then I had input lag and so I said I'm gonna do something else no I've been using I'm very open I have the cartridge but I'm using emulators because that way I can do retro achievements and all that stuff and you know the emulators are retro retro arch is good enough for for a simple NES game retro arch is good enough it's not you know not it runs fine so
3033734	3039645	Alright, let's get into some gaming news and some other things going on in the gaming world.
3040186	3040627	Loki?
3042430	3044214	We just can't stop hearing about Switch 2, huh?
3045211	3046553	Yeah, it's right around the corner.
3046613	3048595	We're expecting announcements very soon.
3048815	3051178	I mean, probably this month, I would imagine.
3052099	3054461	There is a non-zero chance it's this week.
3055062	3058105	Not to set the expectations too high, but I was actually looking back on this.
3059126	3063071	The original Nintendo Switch's press conference was January 13th.
3064232	3065352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3087558	3089542	So, there is that.
3089642	3092206	But, you know, again, it could be the week after.
3092266	3096193	But I think... And sorry, Loki, I don't mean to derail you, but this has to come up at some point.
3097795	3099478	You know, especially with all the leaks out there.
3099518	3099999	Like, I got...
3101013	3104535	sent a screenshot of straight up what those controllers look like.
3105076	3106757	Somebody has just said, here's the controller.
3107017	3107758	Here's what they look like.
3108278	3109719	The colors are on the edge now.
3110239	3111600	This is very different looking.
3111620	3112761	I mean, they look fine.
3113041	3118265	But I'm like, there's so much out there that it's like Nintendo just kind of, there's nothing left to hide.
3118325	3122607	Just put it out there because clearly lots of people on the inside have seen this thing at this point.
3122688	3127171	So I really do think no later than next week.
3127311	3129332	I would be very surprised if it's after.
3129352	3130813	I mean, if it's after next week,
3131874	3145792	I don't think this thing is launching when we think it does I think we're waiting even longer for it which is going to continue to be frustrating for a lot of people so I would say in the next two weeks and a non-zero chance it's actually this week anyway
3146837	3148878	Systems and Methods for Machine Learning Image Conversion
3166927	3184543	and what it it's basically talking about the process that's using AI to upscale textures kind of like DLSS or um PlayStation's PSSR um I think ATIL has or AMD has their own thing um
3185751	3200726	Yeah, so what they're essentially doing is they're going to be storing lower resolution textures on the Switch cartridges to keep the file sizes down, but then upscaling that to look nicer on higher resolution displays.
3201247	3206813	So it's kind of maybe it could be used even for like Switch games on the Switch 2 to...
3208194	3210255	essentially make them look nicer.
3210675	3218217	You know, play them at 1080p or something like that on the portable and then maybe 4K through a dock or something like that.
3219977	3233680	So yeah, we'll have to see what they announce, but it's not unlikely that they would be using some sort of upscaling for visuals and stuff to crank a little bit more fidelity out of the actual console itself.
3234201	3235881	So it's probably not going to be super powered either.
3237898	3244507	Well, as far as the upscaling and all that, though, you know, this is where AI is not so bothersome, right?
3244527	3253499	This is where we sort of expect that AI is going to be actually very useful, as in, you know, kind of... It's when it upscales additional fingers and stuff onto the images.
3254380	3257423	Well, that's the other side is when it's talking about replacing art.
3257463	3264250	I think just in general, God, I don't know about the rest of you, but how sick am I of AI getting shoved into everything?
3264631	3267494	Like even fucking Notepad.
3268295	3271178	Fucking Notepad on Microsoft has a button now.
3271578	3272579	Help me rewrite that.
3272619	3272900	It's like,
3273973	3275134	Leave me the fuck alone.
3275334	3276775	I don't need AI.
3277056	3278417	I didn't enable any of that.
3279377	3280218	I didn't either.
3281119	3282460	On my machine, anyway.
3282600	3285122	It will just enable itself.
3285222	3289125	I might be able to go in and opt out, but the whole thing is just annoying.
3289165	3289386	And then
3289966	3291707	Y'all saw what Facebook did this week.
3291787	3293147	Or Meta, whatever you want to call it.
3293187	3294608	Y'all saw what they did this week.
3294668	3295468	I don't know how much I need to know.
3295508	3297288	Hey, we don't have the bots on our platform.
3297308	3299189	Let's add some more bots to our platform.
3299209	3301090	Well, you don't have to actually be on the platform to see it.
3301110	3301870	It was all our boost guys.
3301890	3304531	Well, Meta rolled out those straight up... Well...
3305131	3310673	I don't know if they actually rolled them out this week, but they were discovered because there was talk about those profiles have actually been there since 2023.
3311574	3318676	But fake profiles that are full on fake people that you can have AI discussions on that look like real people.
3318776	3321257	And DJ Ranma S says, didn't they pull those AI profiles?
3321637	3325399	They did because they were problematic as fuck.
3325859	3337630	I'm not going to get into it, but go look at some of the conversations people were having with some of those profiles and you're going to see how like AI is just not ready to be pushed at a scale that they are pushing it.
3337910	3342234	They are literally trying to sell you chocolate chip cookie dough and not a chocolate chip cookie.
3343355	3345617	Like the kind with raw eggs that might actually kill you.
3345937	3349180	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, at least Tom from MySpace was real.
3349560	3350121	That part.
3351215	3352657	At least Tom from MySpace was real.
3353018	3356323	For the record, I keep most Facebook discussion out of my life.
3357004	3361992	I don't blame you, but it's getting like... I haven't seen a single thing on Blue Sky about it.
3362813	3365798	Having to dodge...
3366937	3367737	Instagram.
3369158	3371018	For me, Instagram's a necessary evil.
3371219	3372479	I have to have it to promote.
3373259	3374540	That's it.
3374640	3378561	If I don't have it, that's a huge audience I'm missing promotion opportunity and all that stuff with.
3378601	3380702	I have to have it.
3380742	3389585	To see these sorts of news and things, it's so frustrating because it's literally taking a shit on this platform.
3389905	3395627	We're trying to push our little indie shows and our scenes and our publicity through, and it's driving people away from
3396147	3401449	from the platform that we're trying to use to, you know, get more people to come to our shows.
3402410	3404030	That's why this thing is just so frustrating.
3404131	3406652	But anyway.
3406952	3407232	All right.
3408933	3409553	Let's move on.
3411271	3412172	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3435766	3437888	And there's a lot of speculation.
3438008	3440329	Why is that not happening?
3440629	3445653	Because apparently, previously, the Xbox makers have said it's nothing to do with the technology.
3445813	3455900	But on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Game Science's CEO, Fang Ji, has actually said it's the Xbox Series S.
3456400	3457582	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3472341	3482047	So this is really sounding like we're at a point where the restrictions that Microsoft has where games have to be released on the S and the X are really starting to bite them.
3482507	3493834	So it probably would have been a good prediction to make this year is that Microsoft finally relents on that policy or they basically make it where if you want to play something on the S...
3494574	3522754	it uses cloud streaming or something to sort of compensate for the lack of power that the S has which I think would be a great way to make games because you know the S was supposed to be a budget console it's for people that you know don't necessarily have the means or you know money to be able to afford these you know higher end consoles and things like that so I think at least if maybe the S could stream X games or something like that or use cloud technology to do it it would help to bridge the gap a little bit
3523714	3530097	I could see where maybe Microsoft could modify the rule to you have to release to the X and cloud streaming so the S people can play it.
3530538	3538662	But I really think that this is not the first time we've heard that the Xbox Series S is actively holding Microsoft back.
3540823	3545905	How in the hell is Grand Theft Auto 6 going to work on the Xbox S?
3546426	3547526	How is that going to work?
3547546	3548927	Well, it...
3550000	3550340	I don't know.
3551421	3556926	I mean, I think it's in a better... I mean, look at how 5 has worked for the longest time.
3557066	3566655	I mean, 5 was a pretty big marvel when it came to streaming assets because that was released back when they had DVD drives that weren't very fast.
3567615	3572780	And you had to stream that stuff off of those drives to get it to even work.
3573360	3575682	A lot of times it would even have to be in...
3576787	3577588	and DarkSakura.
3590373	3590633	All right.
3591013	3597316	Well, going to our chat, Mike Deft with another perspective on this that is absolutely worth reading over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying,
3609881	3610101	DarkSakura
3636011	3639754	and the port that came out in the 90s
3665922	3670468	which, I mean, great game, don't get me wrong, but it's not quite the same.
3671209	3680019	And so there are a few folks out there, namely GameDevBoss,
3681593	3695852	Edmocaldus Nemesis Games put together a Genesis slash Mega Drive tech demo of Shadow Dancer Arcade
3697493	3700915	and it looks like it could be very promising.
3701575	3707558	I mean, and I don't know if anyone knows, there is a Genesis port in the process of Symphony of the Night.
3708499	3708899	Really?
3709179	3709919	And it is playable.
3710580	3711420	Wow.
3711720	3712901	I'm curious.
3712981	3715042	Is there a ROM floating around out there that you can grab?
3715082	3715322	Oh yeah.
3715442	3716182	No, it's absolutely.
3717303	3719504	It was linked on Retro RGB.
3720224	3721745	I can... Let me...
3722614	3723674	Alright, there's a link.
3723694	3724014	Hold on.
3724134	3725955	I will find the specific link.
3725995	3727355	It's on a YouTube video?
3728115	3730096	Yeah, I was like, I just... Okay, here we go.
3730216	3730736	Okay, I see it.
3730776	3731056	I see it.
3731096	3734597	So, yeah, Christmas... Oh, Autumn Update 2024.
3735217	3735857	Okay, there we go.
3735997	3737157	For Mega Drive and Genesis.
3738658	3739918	Oh, you just gave me a direct link.
3740078	3740338	Cool.
3740418	3740998	Let's take a look.
3741018	3741558	Hello, everyone.
3741739	3742879	Is that Tom of year again?
3742899	3745399	Yeah, the demo download is on that video.
3746220	3748660	Okay, somebody's voice got in there on the stream there.
3750601	3751861	Where can we actually see the gameplay?
3752537	3753919	Death Fight is in there.
3770902	3774563	That isn't that different from what we see on PlayStation, for sure.
3774983	3777904	I love that they changed the little CD logo to MD as well.
3777944	3778764	I think that's really cool.
3780264	3783365	There's a few different versions of the demo.
3783685	3790767	I would probably suggest the second one, but it's all Dropbox downloads.
3790867	3791547	The first one...
3792913	3819060	is uh it looks like it's a little buggy it has too many enemies and might freeze up but I mean it's a work in progress I think it's really awesome that's cool love to see the older consoles getting a little love like that that's gonna be fun to play when it comes out there's also a party trying to do Rondo of Blood as well but I I have to go find that again right uh well moving on with newer games Loki
3821319	3831530	Yeah, so Notch had put out a survey earlier, I think it was earlier this week, basically saying, honest and legitimate requests for feedback for once.
3831610	3840500	The game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelite, mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler.
3841841	3842161	But...
3843915	3859089	I know a lot of people have... I got thinking that maybe there are some people here who like my work who may not share my taste in retro nostalgia and prefer for me to make a spiritual successor to Minecraft.
3859149	3860890	I mean, sure, I'd take that cash.
3862091	3863593	So, market research.
3863653	3865915	And then, of course, everybody voted for Minecraft 2.
3867616	3869638	So he is going to...
3871199	3875622	potentially work on something that may be a spiritual successor to Minecraft?
3876723	3877143	We'll see.
3877163	3878784	He's not going to be able to call it Minecraft.
3879284	3880585	No, it'll be something else.
3880625	3883587	He's got to watch what he calls it on social media, but he sold it.
3883647	3884968	Everything Minecraft, he sold.
3885208	3887169	Microsoft gets to make Minecraft 2 if they ever want to.
3887189	3888290	That's true, that's true.
3888650	3893733	It would be kind of like a bloodstain ritual of the night to Castlevania, you know?
3893813	3894574	But he...
3895214	3911163	he's obviously going to lean into that like just from a pure money and publicity perspective he will allow other people to call it Microsoft 2 Minecraft 2 but he's going to have to stay away from calling it that himself or he'll get in a lot of trouble
3911929	3937775	of course he will it'll be that movie poster from the creators of Minecraft or from the producer of this movie comes this, you know, that type of thing but Notch has run his mouth a few times online and it is important to say Notch has not always come off as a good person now, I think the last time he got himself into trouble was probably 2019 or something I haven't read what his antics are up to
3938920	3959592	if he has changed his outlook on certain things I'm willing to believe that people change especially from COVID and all that stuff but all I'm going to say is that I'm approaching this with a skeptical eye on am I actually going to be able to support this or not because if he still kind of acts like a shit on social media I'm not interested
3960618	3961438	No, for sure.
3961458	3962498	No, understandable.
3963079	3964039	And I don't know.
3964259	3964419	Yeah.
3964939	3970120	But again... Also, I'm not like... This was five years ago was the last time I think he got in hot water.
3970620	3973981	A lot of people change, especially in light of COVID and all that stuff.
3974421	3984943	So if he's at least stopped trying to actively say stupid shit on the internet, I'm willing to take a look at what's under the curtain, you know?
3986334	4015781	yeah so we'll see what he says but like I mean honestly even like the last like dev project that he was working on like nothing really came of that either so like I don't know I well didn't he make another game after Minecraft called Scrolls or something because there's a whole big thing with yeah because he was working ironically now we're both Microsoft so like what a what a waste of everybody's fucking time at the end of the day but yeah yeah yeah unfortunately but yeah he was working on a game called Scrolls or whatever and then yeah they
4017315	4018516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4038783	4046767	and maybe he's kind of past that point in his life where Microsoft paid him a disgusting amount of money for Minecraft.
4047127	4048668	Am I not wrong?
4048988	4052349	Didn't he buy Beyonce's house or something like that or the other way around?
4052369	4055251	I think he got, it was like $2 billion, wasn't it?
4055311	4057211	Yeah, he got oodles of money.
4057351	4060313	And of course, that's the time when he started...
4060973	4076942	you know kind of blah blah blah blah so this the fact that he's kind of going maybe I want to make an indie game again is kind of making me go okay maybe he's come back down to earth a little bit but cautious optimism bolded italicized underlined mm-hmm
4078415	4081397	TigerClaw in chat says he made over a billion selling Minecraft.
4081437	4082618	Isn't that enough to retire?
4083139	4083499	It is.
4083899	4094426	But the fact that maybe he doesn't want to is why I'm saying, hmm, this is interesting that there could be some type of maybe changed outlook on things on his end.
4095207	4095667	So we'll see.
4096508	4099109	But remember, actions speak louder than words.
4099930	4100150	All right.
4102196	4121543	Moving on, let's talk about a game company that I actually talking about Guardian Legend and all this stuff, I have often invoked Inti Creates as a company I would love to see create a new Guardian Legend type of game because they did Blaster Master Zero and I thought they did a very good job with that.
4121643	4128806	There's a few companies I think I would trust doing the Guardian Legend if we were to ever get that, but I think at this point it's a fever dream.
4129326	4129586	But
4130186	4133648	Inti Creates has said they are looking to announce several titles this year.
4133728	4135950	And again, I don't want to set unreasonable expectations.
4136450	4138491	The Guardian Legend is OLR fanfic.
4138651	4139572	It's not reality.
4139652	4141373	So don't even put your expectations there.
4141813	4145376	I'm still interested in what they are going to announce, though, because I enjoy the things they've put out.
4146436	4150499	They are going to be placing a focus on what they call their 2D action games.
4151299	4155682	On social media, CEO and President Takuya Aizu said, Happy New Year!
4156042	4162726	This year we plan to announce several titles with a focus on our company's specialty of 2D action games.
4163467	4169771	Some games that Inti creates released in 2024 include Gunvolt Records' Chironical,
4170571	4179415	Umbra Claw, Card and Seal on the Switch, and then Gal Guardians, Servants of the Dark, which is kind of a Castlevania-esque sort of game.
4179735	4182476	That is coming out in March, and we know about that as well.
4182776	4189619	There also was Divine Dynamo Flamefrit in November of 2024, which was a top-down dungeon crawler.
4190579	4218929	which got okay reviews but it wasn't something that was like going to be game of the year which again that game was similar to Card and Seal which is more of like a deck building roguelike type of game so you see that they've kind of done these things you know a little bit around the board which is fine you know when you're a when you're a small gaming company you know kind of doing your thing and your games are well received you get to experiment a little bit but it is fun to hear that it sounds like they're going to go back to their roots this year a little bit so we'll we'll see we'll see what happens
4220691	4225633	Dark Tatooine chats, as I was going to say, I know they came up during Rob's Guardian Legend stream, so you never know.
4226034	4229095	I think Compile is technically still around, so there's that slim chance.
4229615	4236698	I believe it is determined that Irem is the company that would need to agree that the Guardian Legend is allowed to continue.
4237078	4237879	That's the company...
4238899	4260328	even though yes Compile still exists I believe Compile made the game for Irem using Irem IPs so that's the company you need to get on board with a new Guardian Legend but again I want to watch because I don't want to project my fan fiction as any sort of expectation that's not fair to Inti Creates and the games they want to make um
4261621	4263242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4278871	4306801	well I do like my pinball so Stern actually and even Dan sent me this put out a trailer for Dungeons and Dragons The Tyrant's Eye on pinball it's looking pretty neat it also has voice cast from Critical Role and there is different musicians included like Gerard Way
4309263	4335977	Luke Gygax is involved Kevin Smith is involved and Chris Velasco who did music for Bloodborne and Mass Effect 2 is doing music for Tyrant's Eye so yeah it's the lead designer is Brian Eddy who did Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness so definitely some good stuff there I'm
4337578	4338919	I'm pretty excited by it.
4339399	4342141	I pretty much said that this has to happen.
4345722	4348164	This table looks rad as fuck, to be honest.
4348844	4359710	I saw the trailer cross by my social media feed and I was like, this is really... I love the idea of the randomly generated weekly... That's such a brilliant idea to try to get people to come back and play over and over.
4359910	4364333	Or if you're a private owner, like yourself, Jamie, or Bobby Blackwell... I don't want it.
4364633	4364653	I...
4365473	4367174	And now you're in this, Loki?
4367374	4367854	Oh my gosh!
4368134	4369455	No, no, it just looks cool.
4369475	4370335	I wouldn't buy it.
4370395	4371236	It's too expensive.
4371296	4373296	But, like, it looks awesome, though.
4373316	4376618	Like, if I was going to get a table, like, that would probably be it.
4376938	4381400	Yeah, I'm kind of hoping, like, you know, obviously I would love to go to DarkSakura's house to play it if she gets it.
4381840	4386502	But, you know, Coin-Off or one of those other places, if they get it, too, I'd probably go check it out.
4387302	4390804	We have some beef, though, with some of the people at Coin-Off.
4391124	4391344	Well...
4392409	4401686	I didn't want to get too far into it, but I was there recently and I kind of noticed, even though they've remodeled the whole place and it looks nicer, the game selection's gone downhill.
4402708	4426819	they've they've leaned into ticket munchers and that whole thing and that's unfortunate like their whole pinball thing in the back not what it used to be that's all ticket munchers now yeah exactly that so I think you and I are on a similar page but you probably know more about what's going on I just as a customer I went and I went oh this is a little disappointing all right uh anyhow let's move on Loki
4428396	4453904	Alright, so it's funny, we talked about Bolaltro having some issues with the ESRB and being rated, you know, mature or, you know, AO in certain regions because of gambling mechanics which is funny compared to all these games that have actual gambling in them
4454457	4455618	Even though the game's not like that.
4455778	4465767	But the game Luck Be a Landlord, which was a game that did inspire the creator to create Bolaltro, has a slot machine mechanic that's in the game.
4465947	4467689	Granted, no actual gambling.
4467749	4469190	It's just a mechanic of the game.
4469630	4473694	But they are running into the same problem on the Google Play Store.
4474134	4476216	Basically, that they've been...
4477637	4479878	Thank you for watching!
4493467	4493567	Hmm.
4493587	4493647	Hmm.
4513032	4533562	but they are fighting it right now it says I've now filled out the Google Play age rating questionnaire to agree that my game contains gambling I'm doing this in an attempt to stop my game from being banned globally on Google Play since every time I've tried to appeal these decisions I've been simply sent a screenshot of my game and was told this is gambling
4536104	4537465	You need to have actual people.
4537525	4539567	You really need to have actual people that look at this.
4539627	4541448	This is so silly.
4541868	4546712	And it almost makes you go, it feels like somebody is out to get this game and reported it.
4546752	4553137	Because there's always some loser on the internet that wants to be a cop and go out there and try to police all this stuff.
4553157	4555519	And we've heard a lot of this stuff with the YouTube.
4555619	4563384	There was this whole thing about Nintendo YouTubes getting pulled out where the guy was faking being a lawyer for Nintendo, allegedly, and all this stuff.
4563464	4564885	It's just like, oh my gosh.
4565906	4567548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4583789	4591815	And although we don't often get a ton of gaming news at a consumer electronics show, sometimes we get just that, new electronics.
4592215	4596659	Which could mean, historically, it's been things like new arcade 1-up machines and things of that sort.
4596999	4598580	We've seen that sort of thing happen before.
4599661	4606586	But I believe on that front, I think arcade 1-up has said they're not actually going to be there this year, so don't get your hopes up for that.
4607067	4611130	But we are getting a glance at the Atari...
4612554	4618377	Game Station, the Atari Game Station Go is what we're seeing a little tease of here.
4619098	4628183	We don't know a lot about it, except it looks like a lot of the contemporary sorts of things, like say a Steam Deck or something, except there's that number pad that shows up.
4628243	4633046	Like it actually has, and knowing that Atari, see a lot of people are reading into this saying,
4633726	4652759	well Atari did have a number pad at some point that released a limited number of games I'm sitting here going did you all do you all have amnesia Atari bought Intellivision hello so I mean that keypad could be used potentially for some Intellivision games which for some reason is not being called out in any of these articles but whatever um
4654381	4655662	We don't know what else is going to be on this.
4655722	4665373	The trailer only shows what this thing looks like, and we know it is a product between Atari and My Arcade, which has already released some.
4665634	4669078	I have an Atari console that was sold at Costco, a 2600+.
4670359	4672820	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4693209	4695411	What am I getting out of this that emulators won't get me?
4713143	4721751	I think that's a key question that even if the answer in fact is, well, this is legal, that answer is not going to be good enough.
4721791	4724273	And if they think it is going to be good enough, they are foolish.
4724654	4726055	And I'm not saying it should be that way.
4726075	4726876	I'm just saying it is.
4726956	4728477	Remember that whole discussion about facts?
4729498	4730719	That's the reality.
4731780	4734283	So I'll be curious to see what they do with this.
4734323	4736525	But it has an HDMI port.
4736885	4741950	It has USB-C ports on the top, maybe for some controllers, some LED lighting.
4743771	4745533	It'll be curious to see what happens with this.
4745873	4750758	So it should be pointed out the My Arcade Game Station Pro is...
4751098	4753178	had 200 titles built into it.
4754019	4760040	But more information on this will be unveiled at CES, which is next week, starting on Tuesday.
4760440	4765741	So we can see if they are able to answer that question or not.
4765821	4768262	DJ Ranma S says support for Jaguar games.
4768882	4770442	Emulators can run Jaguar games.
4770502	4772162	Jaguar games are in Atari 50.
4773543	4776763	And funny enough, DarkSakura and I were just talking about this before the show.
4776803	4779644	You were mentioning an analog Jaguar product, right?
4780763	4783325	I saw something about it popping up as a story.
4783385	4784906	I didn't dig too deeply into it.
4785146	4785366	Yeah.
4785846	4788828	So again, I think there's a tough question here to answer.
4789668	4790109	But we'll see.
4790149	4790449	We'll see.
4791249	4793931	I am a sucker for retro games and these sorts of things.
4794411	4797693	So I don't know if I see myself buying a dedicated handheld.
4798114	4803577	I feel like, again, I don't really do a ton of handheld gaming and the Steam Deck now more than has that covered.
4803979	4807041	I'm more a sucker for these sorts of collectibles, like the tiny arcade games.
4807361	4814785	In fact, all these little, you know, on Twitch, you see very tiny little baby arcade machines that are more, they run off batteries.
4814825	4816386	That's why I don't have them running during the show.
4817206	4824490	But they're very, very, they're usually like Coleco versions of arcade games on little tiny, a lot of these are by My Arcade.
4824791	4826692	There were basically two companies that made these.
4826732	4828893	The My Arcade ones are slightly larger.
4829293	4830154	So My Arcade
4830894	4835596	Even though you may not recognize that name, they've been in this retro game for a little while.
4836196	4838696	Because I was buying these pre-COVID.
4839197	4842158	So they've been in the retro game for a little while, so it's worth keeping an eye on.
4843098	4849520	Alright, since I brought up retro games, what a good time to get into a regular segment we do here on OLR.
4860498	4867804	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4868264	4870866	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4872107	4873228	All right, DarkSakura.
4874248	4875709	I can't believe this game is this old.
4875729	4876330	What did you pick?
4877791	4880912	Neither can I. It's Batman Arkham Asylum from 2009.
4881073	4896019	The game was developed by Rocksteady Studios, published by Eidos Interactive, working with Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, based off of the DC Comics Batman.
4898040	4901002	So, yeah, it went into...
4902182	4929836	quite a bit of things that were heavily influenced from various classic stories in the comics of course Battling the Joker but there's also other baddies hanging around it seems like it was inspired by some of the writing of Neil Adams and Frank Miller and some Grant Morrison it was run in Unreal Engine 3
4930996	4936604	And it did go through quite a bit of changes before it came out, but this was definitely...
4938027	4939769	A game that I think was well received.
4939889	4941470	And they had a feeling it would be.
4941850	4944673	So they put definite hints to sequels buried in the game.
4945954	4953220	It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in August 2009 with a Windows version to follow.
4954301	4963048	And it won awards and actually held the Guinness World Record for most critically acclaimed superhero game ever.
4965678	4977564	it had a game of the year edition in 2010 a remastered one for PS4 and Xbox One in 2016 and a Switch version that came out in 2023 and it launched an entire series
4979037	4980618	So it is an action-adventure game.
4980678	4982139	It's from a third-person perspective.
4983000	4996488	And you get yourself trapped in Arkham Asylum, where basically the inmates have taken it over.
4997788	5024963	you have detective vision where you activate this mode to get more clues by highlighting certain things and looking at skeletons and destructible walls and your enemies so you basically have can see where everyone and everything's weaknesses you have a batarang you have a remote controlled version that you can follow and sometimes you can find different little easter eggs that way
5025663	5029344	or even use it to be a distraction or diversion.
5029784	5033785	You also are finding notes left by the Riddler.
5036246	5044708	And he hacks into Batman's comms to give him some clues and different riddles too.
5045308	5048971	And it's a very free flow... They call it free flow combat.
5049491	5052353	Where you have attack, stun, and counter for your combat.
5052373	5056035	But you can combine these to do all kinds of different moves and stuff.
5056075	5058077	And you get experience points for combat.
5061159	5069084	So... Basically, you... It's an older game, but you also...
5071981	5075705	It's just one that's way too involved for me to actually go into a lot.
5076726	5088096	But I will say that the Windows version was compatible... Sorry, it uses NVIDIA's physics software to create its interactions.
5089177	5090098	And it also...
5091779	5096305	You know, had all kinds of other effects that were in it, very dynamic.
5098187	5107919	And the Game of the Year edition let you use a 3D mode by using any TV that had the anaglyph 3D glasses.
5108900	5132215	so there was that of course we had the three probably most well-known voices for any Batman series ever Kevin Conroy, rest in peace as Batman Mark Hamill as the Joker Arlene Sorkin as Harley Quinn so there you go
5133395	5152547	um it uh was uh it started well it was announced in August 2008 developed by Rocksteady Studios um you know again with Eidos and Warner Brothers Interactive and uh they uh
5154551	5165437	started going into full production as of September, bringing in Paul Dini, who was a writer for the animated series and in Detective Comics.
5166738	5173682	And, you know, it basically just went fully into design mode.
5174082	5176363	They hadn't finished the cast, but they had the setting.
5176403	5177884	They knew Joker was going to be in it.
5178945	5183067	And then there was a matter of bringing in
5184087	5212781	like I mentioned earlier elements from some of different writers but as well as how to use certain items were actually influenced by Legend of Zelda and Metroid games so there for anyone who remembers E3 2009 it was hardcore like it had a big section for its marketing and
5214904	5239403	On top of that too, because it was so well received, there was a collector's edition that had a 14 inch or 36 centimeter replica of the Batarang, a behind the scenes DVD, a 48 page book about Arkham's inmate, and it was leather bound, a code to download Crime Alley challenge map,
5240576	5247140	and you also could get Den Bones challenge map by ordering at certain retailers.
5247560	5256005	The Game of the Year edition was announced originally only for Europe, Asia, and Australia but of course there was a North American release later.
5257126	5273417	and it had the game, the Trioviz 3D visual effects, two pairs of themed 3D glasses and the six released DLC challenge maps, two of which were not made available in North America.
5274437	5283163	There was downloadable content that was available exclusively for PlayStation 3 and Mac OS X
5285791	5310766	there were the later release the Insane Night Pack with the Totally Insane Combat and Nocturnal Hunter was released November 17th sorry September 17th 2009 Prey in the Darkness, A Heart of Darkness Hot House Prey and it was the Prey in the Darkness Pack was an exclusive again for PS3 and Mac OS X there was
5312447	5323694	Batman Return to Arkham by Virtuos that was a compilation of a remastered Arkham Asylum and Arkham City for Unreal Engine 4.
5324694	5331078	There's an Arkham trilogy that was developed by Turn Me Up that also included Batman Arkham Knight for Switch.
5332239	5336801	So yeah, so here is where we get into the reception.
5340425	5363939	it was basically its Metacritic score for Xbox 360 gave it a 92 out of 100 PlayStation 3 got 91 out of 100 the Windows version the same it held the Guinness World Record for most critically acclaimed superhero game ever until it was succeeded by Arkham City so there you go
5364959	5394089	and it everyone just loved it everyone was like this is the best you know it shows what a superhero game is it was engaging the story setting everything was amazing and it was referred to I like this description by Andy Robinson of Computer and Video Games said it is a thinking man's stealth game I think that's a great thing and there were
5396534	5417419	you had like Scarecrow the Scarecrow battles were definitely praised as some of the most and I'm quoting cerebral moments because it manipulates the fourth wall I thought that was pretty cool they put it along the lines of the Psycho Mantis battle in Metal Gear Solid and
5418891	5439846	but yeah it won bajillions awards um it won outstanding achievement in the AIAS 13th annual interactive achievement awards uh game design adaptive story character performance by Mark Hamill um nominated for game of the year adventure of the year it
5440524	5464533	it won many many and it was also the highest rated uh uh hold on I lost where I was oh yeah it was the highest rated Microsoft Windows game alongside Dragon Age Origins and Street Fighter 4 so yeah I I am I'm not gonna name all of the things it won a bunch of the things
5466093	5492878	it won two BAFTAs I mean, there you go so yeah and going into a little bit more, Grant Morrison said that it influenced the Batman Incorporated comic books and was quoted saying, when I played that game it was the first time in my life I actually felt what it was like to be Batman high praise yeah
5494158	5521895	so there you go I didn't even touch everything I caressed it a little bit that's fine Batman Arkham Asylum your classic game of the week and yeah gosh I'm 15 years old at this point not just 10 but 15 16 really and also I kind of have to thank Nick for influencing this one because he suggested the Batman Ness game but I was like no I'm going to do Arkham okay alright
5522555	5523736	I remember the Batman NES game.
5524016	5527298	Actually, I was surprised that I have not done a single Batman game.
5528599	5528960	Really?
5530360	5531461	There were some bad ones over the years.
5533062	5536104	Alright, we have some rapid fire news we're going to get into.
5536164	5539547	We're also going to get into, sooner rather than later, a listener roundtable.
5539567	5544170	So if you want to give us a call, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5544190	5546472	But first, we have some more stories coming at you.
5546492	5548293	So Loki, let's go to some rapid fire news.
5549400	5556101	You know, it's so crazy to think that, you know, the thing that it takes to get someone out of retirement when it comes to acting is money.
5557421	5560242	And that's the case, I guess, with Jim Carrey.
5560262	5566643	Because, you know, we have confirmation that they've already greenlit a fourth Sonic movie.
5566783	5570964	And he's like, hey, I wouldn't mind coming back to be Eggman again.
5573164	5576145	And yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him in a fourth Sonic movie.
5576205	5577705	So maybe that'll happen.
5578533	5579713	Even though he's, like, died.
5581174	5582254	But whatever, you know.
5582274	5582575	Spoilers.
5582595	5583355	I'm just kidding.
5584235	5585496	Yeah, he dies in, like, all of them.
5585756	5586896	It's fine.
5586916	5589137	I imagine it's one of those things that's humorous at this point.
5589437	5595399	By the way, I think I saw something in Discord because, you know, Tigerclaw's a huge Sonic fan and posts a lot of stuff on Discord about that.
5596000	5598861	The movie made a billion worldwide across that mark.
5600101	5600681	It's made a lot.
5600722	5601142	I know that.
5601182	5601802	Yeah, it's made a lot.
5603342	5613833	or maybe that's the whole franchise is made a billion one movie making a billion that's a lot but the whole franchise yeah still impressive that seems a little high for one movie but I know it did pretty well so I don't know franchise made a billion yeah okay
5615733	5642274	and then we've got some Sonic games you can check out so one thing that's kind of nice about Sega is they do kind of give a green light to fans making fan games and one of those is Sonic Galactic it looks really cool they said it's I guess it's kind of it looks like a
5644096	5646297	A 2D Sonic game, but with better graphics.
5646477	5650559	But then they also have these sections that are like 2.5D almost.
5651439	5652160	That look kind of cool.
5652180	5654101	It's like running on a wall or something like that.
5654181	5656061	I really liked how it looked.
5656181	5658523	But it's got five playable characters in there.
5658603	5664245	Sonic the Tails, Knuckles, Fang the Sniper, and... Who's the other one?
5664265	5665606	There's another one in there as well.
5666106	5666766	There's a mole.
5668047	5668747	Tunnel the Mole.
5669087	5670428	It's an original character.
5672247	5675168	that they may make new friends for Sonic.
5675248	5678089	Definitely looks legit.
5678410	5684852	It's a good thing Sega is usually pretty friendly to these sorts of projects and probably won't be trying to shut this one down anytime soon, but yeah.
5685472	5687013	Ooh, the multiplayer mode looks kind of cute.
5687973	5690374	Yeah, the graphics look really cool.
5690415	5692035	It's almost like either 32X or...
5694622	5721930	you know something but I like the that like quasi 2D thing that they've got it's like on a wall or something like that yeah I don't know like a bonus stage thing looks fun looks neat yeah great uh but yeah if you're interested in that you can check it out at um sonicgalactic.github.io all right uh let's move on DarkSakura
5724636	5734894	So there is the Arcade Archives Castle of Dragon coming to the Switch on already out.
5737262	5738322	It looks like it's already out.
5739142	5740103	It came out on the second.
5740803	5745924	So it is available for download.
5746184	5751725	It was one of the arcade archive series by Hamster.
5752286	5762788	It is an action game that was released by Athena in 1993 where you are two kings to go to a castle inhabited by dragons and save a princess.
5762828	5765269	Trope, trope, trope, trope, trope.
5765909	5766329	There you go.
5769531	5770873	All right.
5770973	5773616	Moving on to this story real quick.
5773917	5778262	Since it is the beginning of the year, that means it's time for another Awesome Games Done Quick.
5778382	5781766	So Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 did get underway today.
5781806	5784330	I think they kicked off with Astro Bot was the first game
5785010	5785891	that they did earlier.
5786111	5788913	No, it was, I'm sorry, Pikmin looks like was the first game.
5789033	5793636	Astro Bot was just a highlight from today's set that is going on there.
5793776	5798739	I think Tomb Raider is the next game they're about to get into as we're taping live here.
5800000	5803322	So we're somewhere between this Zelda the Wind Waker and Tomb Raider run.
5803342	5804583	They might be right in between here.
5805243	5807325	as we are live doing our show tonight.
5807805	5816692	And as you know by now, the Awesome Games Done Quick charity, it's raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation because, you know, fuck cancer.
5817353	5821236	But they raised an awful lot of money for it, and they're going to run for the entire...
5821736	5821896	Oh, fun.
5837253	5837994	That's going to be fun.
5838054	5839094	So there you go.
5839395	5840836	Raising money for a great cause.
5840856	5843237	Some other games to look forward to on the final day.
5843617	5844758	Final day is pretty stacked.
5845139	5846920	Elden Ring is there during the final day.
5847500	5849161	The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
5849842	5852003	Echoes of Wisdom is a bonus game.
5852223	5854225	I believe that means if they raise enough money, they'll do that.
5854825	5861048	and the much-anticipated Crazy Taxi with Live Backing Band is also on Saturday.
5861088	5861648	Oh, that's right.
5861748	5862109	That's right.
5862129	5862729	I forgot about that.
5862749	5866591	So that's going to be a pretty stacked day there for Awesome Games Done Quick.
5866871	5867491	Please enjoy.
5868392	5871173	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5872694	5874595	We'll go to here in the U.S.
5874635	5874875	first.
5874975	5875155	Loki.
5876531	5903787	not a whole lot coming out this week but we've got Sea Fantasy on PC Ys Memoir The Oath in Fengana that's going to be on Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 The Fox's Way Home on Nintendo Switch Freedom Wars Remastered on PC, Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and that's it
5905530	5906951	All right, traveling to Japan.
5908112	5911135	We at least are getting releases again, but it is still a slow week.
5911515	5918440	On the Nintendo Switch, we have Freedom Wars Remastered releases on January 9th, and that is the lone release on the Nintendo Switch.
5918981	5923124	And it is also being released on the PlayStation 5, Freedom Wars Remastered.
5923664	5926747	And honestly, that is pretty much your only big release.
5927567	5929629	Honkai Star Rail is out next week.
5930429	5934452	I imagine a lot of people grabbed that digitally, but there's the Trailblazer edition coming out on the 15th.
5935774	5939538	But as far as this week goes, still a little slow, but at least there's something.
5940018	5941139	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5943262	5947406	Freedom Wars Remastered for Switch on PS4, PS5, PC on January 10th.
5948687	5948988	Alright.
5949348	5949648	That's it.
5950149	5950549	That's it.
5950930	5954413	We still gotta ease into the year a little bit, but in a couple weeks it'll get going again.
5955154	5960377	Alright, I think we just have one quick story here, and boy, if this isn't a prediction... And we did get an email.
5960817	5961677	Just foreshadowing.
5961997	5962418	Oh, great.
5962618	5962898	Hooray.
5963238	5964999	Okay, we'll get to that in just a moment.
5965119	5971782	Then we have one story here that's very... What a 2025 kind of story.
5971822	5972883	Way to kick things off, right?
5973943	5974684	What year is this?
5974704	5976244	Are we going to really do this again?
5976365	5978586	Are we really seeing this again?
5980127	6000923	but yes, apparently there's been a tweet by Mike Shapiro who you may know as the voice actor of the G-Man from the Half-Life series putting out some cryptic thing on Twitter talking about what's coming in 2025 I think
6007683	6036390	uh that's cool and all but I think that people may be misinterpreting what that's teasing because you know everyone's like oh Half-Life 3 obviously but you may remember what else is G-Man in that is going to be getting its absolute cinematic release in the movie movie sphere why it's Skivity Toilet and G-Man is in Skivity Toilet technically so I think that's what they're teasing
6037606	6038946	Clearly not Half-Life 3.
6039107	6043408	That sounds completely reasonable, to be honest, Loki, with the direction you're going with it.
6044468	6045108	But stay tuned.
6045128	6055512	Yeah, I'm just kind of rolling my eyes at Half-Life 3 teases this week, although they did go back and do all that work with Half-Life 2 for the anniversary, but I don't know.
6055532	6058913	I feel like Half-Life Alex was Half-Life 3.
6058953	6061133	That's what you get.
6061333	6061613	Enjoy.
6062034	6064274	Well, just like it'd be a new Half-Life thing.
6064474	6065095	It doesn't have to be 3.
6065675	6066255	It could be just...
6067594	6068935	Something new, I guess.
6070336	6070716	Fair enough.
6070816	6073638	Another side story to prevent Valve from having to print the number three.
6073818	6076500	The three key is broken on all of their computers, as it turns out.
6077360	6077720	Portal 3.
6079355	6082697	Alright, well this is the part of the show where we get into the listener roundtable.

6105376	6107057	Yeah, so I'll read it.
6108077	6109958	Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi here.
6110439	6112760	I just wanted to say, as always, great work on the show.
6112840	6115241	Glad to see it's still going and I hope it keeps going.
6115641	6117962	It's been a household staple here in our house.
6118563	6119803	Keep up the good work, y'all.
6119883	6124906	I've been playing a lot of games and it seems like my new faves are Stellar Blade and, of course, Astro Blot.
6125646	6150008	I did find a new to me Metroidvania similar to Hollow Knight called Voidrot and mad shout out to our own DarkSakura for the heads up and checking out Fantasian Neo Dimension it's got really deep FF7 and I think DarkTutsi has said 4 or 6 as well I'm really enjoying it anyway just wanted to give you something to read for the show have a good one and stay awesome always Mishi
6150967	6151507	Thanks, Mishi.
6151547	6152148	Appreciate it.
6152828	6154149	And yeah, you're reminding me.
6154629	6156610	I need to make time for Fantasia and Neo Dimension.
6156630	6157790	I really want to play it.
6160592	6163733	But, you know, only so much time in the day, right?
6163833	6165314	But I really want to make time for that one.
6166014	6168976	As an old school Final Fantasy fan, I feel like I owe it to myself to play that one.
6170297	6171637	And I feel like DarkSakura would agree.
6174178	6174479	Alright.
6174739	6176019	Well, thank you so much for the email, Mishi.
6176079	6176580	Appreciate you.
6177360	6178160	Hope you're having a great 2025 so far.
6180186	6180706	All right.
6181186	6183887	Just some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
6184007	6188429	SSJ100Matt says, Jason Schreier, I forget, what's the big player?
6189029	6190250	Was he Washington Post, New York Times?
6190270	6191030	He's one of those big players.
6191050	6193211	He used to be Taku years and years ago, right?
6193271	6194471	Now he kind of does more indie stuff.
6194511	6195751	Bloomberg was the big thing, right?
6196372	6198052	I said it right as Bobby put it in chat.
6198092	6198672	It was Bloomberg.
6200493	6205660	He is predicting that Half-Life 3 is one of his 2025 predictions.
6205760	6206841	That Half-Life 3 is actually happening.
6207181	6210866	Maybe reading into the obvious read on that last story.
6210906	6213049	I don't know if he said that before or after what you were saying.
6213529	6214410	If he said it before...
6215458	6242390	that's interesting because that guy does have his ear he has this you know for for better or whatever he he does have a lot more industry people to talk to him uh and can probably get a better read on some stuff that's going on in the industry so if he's saying that it does raise an eyebrow um but again I'll believe it when I see it as I think most of us are at that point yeah I like the idea of Half-Life spinoff though especially something that maybe would complement like a Steam Deck refresh
6243476	6270042	you know like if the Steam Deck were to get a refresh this year like imagine like a Half-Life game that runs really well on that and somehow is you know I don't know what it would do differently you know tailored to that whether using touchscreen or something but but I don't know that's why my brain my brain is going maybe there'd be something to really push more Steam Decks in that regard I mean if Switch 2 has their own launch titles maybe a Steam Deck 2 ought to have their own launch titles we'll see mm-hmm
6270724	6296345	uh he's saying uh Matt is also saying in chat as Joe and Matt says he also thinks Grand Theft Auto 6 slips into 2026 um wouldn't be surprised wouldn't be surprised would any of us not at this point all right well with that we are going to well let me check in for any last minute stories Loki I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about um I did not okay
6297216	6325562	then that's it we're going to wrap it all up thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and being here with us tonight we are the show where every gamer has a voice but remember we need more voices to put out on air so help us spread the word tell a friend or two all that good stuff a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube wherever it is you found this podcast five star review goes an awful long way and we really appreciate all of that that's it we're going to wrap it up
6326142	6352028	DarkSakura, I think you told me earlier you're not going to stream tonight you're going to rest up a little bit but we'll still go to you first for any final thoughts yeah, I have until I figure out what's going on with my work schedule my Sunday night stream, I might start doing a Saturday, not Saturday but earlier in the day on Sunday but but yeah
6355539	6355999	I'm tired.
6356660	6357121	Fair enough.
6357321	6357701	I get it.
6357781	6358122	I get it.
6359563	6360564	Loki, your final thought tonight?
6362266	6368794	My final thought is I just finished designing that build, I think, and it's 475,000 blocks at least.
6368834	6369494	It is my biggest project again.
6375828	6376228	Alright.
6377768	6382549	And then my final thought is I hope we have a good year ahead for gaming.
6382650	6385450	I hope we hear about less layoffs.
6385670	6393792	I hope we find ourselves back in a good place and have some things to get excited about like a new Switch or whatever Steam Deck decides to go.
6393852	6395992	I hope we get some things to be excited about again.
6396052	6402634	So let's hope that 2025 is a great year for gaming and that's all I got to say on that.
6403234	6404195	Have a great week, everybody.
6404235	6406357	We will see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
6406437	6406778	Good night.
6427680	6429643	But you know they were all still true.
6429723	6430383	See you next week.
