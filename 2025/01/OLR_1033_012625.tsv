11325	12006	Thanks for watching!
40185	43027	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43128	48052	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48152	54697	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with you once again tonight, January the 26th of 2025, episode number 1033 of our show.
61403	68005	as we continue into our 23rd broadcast year, having started this whole thing June of 2002.
68125	69965	Myself, Rob Roberts, with you.
70405	74606	Here the entire time with my co-host, of course, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
78007	80608	Who I think is not coming through for some reason.
80628	80948	I'm not muted.
81128	81628	Oh, weird.
81928	82468	Now I hear you.
83468	84569	Must be a weird noise gate thing.
84609	84889	I don't know.
84909	85349	But how are you?
87749	89050	Well, I just pulled a muscle.
89490	90070	That's okay.
91417	93479	Yeah, well, it was really weird.
93559	95561	It's a muscle I've never pulled before.
95601	99424	It's the rectus femoris, which goes from the hip to the knee.
99805	100145	I see.
101246	102367	A very long tendon on it.
103308	104289	I was just in the shower.
104509	110815	I was just standing up and reaching for something, and my muscle's like, hey, guess what?
111015	111916	Yeah.
113339	125126	You know, getting old Let's be like a ballet thing It's funny I open up the show with an age thing because, you know, it's just like that whole getting old thing Is that like, oh, what muscle am I going to discover I have today that I just suddenly heard?
125166	126407	What did I sleep on wrong today?
126427	138174	This has nothing to do with that, this is probably from ballet But I'm also like, you know, for me, I'm waking up with something new every day I was telling you I have this weird eye thing going on before the show And it's just like, what damage report every morning?
138254	139675	It's like, what did I do to my body today?
141107	142787	That's no fun.
169419	175043	Evil, I do actually have a Theragun, but you don't use a Theragun on an injured muscle.
175203	175704	You do not.
177025	178385	It's not a cramp.
178866	179806	It's not tightness.
180287	181528	It is a freaking injury.
181648	182368	It is hot.
182848	184610	I am about to put an ice pack on it.
185430	189533	Never, ever suggest that someone use a Theragun on an injured muscle.
189653	190834	It will hurt them worse.
191294	198119	It will make the muscle actually... It'll exacerbate the injury.
199062	200203	Responding to a comment in our chat room.
200223	200823	It is not a cramp.
200923	202023	It is a pulled muscle.
202043	208806	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network where we do tape live every Sunday night, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
210307	211448	This is almost PG-13.
211668	212568	Almost, almost.
213909	215449	Also, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
216410	216730	Hello.
216890	217430	Always PG-13.
217470	217791	How are you?
219324	220205	And usually, yeah.
220605	221266	I'm doing all right.
221526	221766	Yeah.
221846	224208	And now I noticed behind you, you have this Minecraft video.
224228	230313	This is the one you were working very hard on that you were promoting this week on your social media.
230653	238220	And I have to say, I did watch it and I was like, and you know, I don't really play a lot of Minecraft, but this is my typical reaction to your videos is like,
238880	239820	How the hell?
240161	243042	Like, it's just so these things are so big.
243122	245943	Like, I don't know how you plan for this stuff or any of that.
245963	247124	Like, it's just it's just wild.
247184	250365	Like how you and so elaborate all of these things.
250405	253807	Like, it's a full on freaking like water ride, but in Minecraft.
254247	254988	And it was really impressive.
255008	258209	And then you like do like a little tour about how the sausage is made, basically.
259270	262971	And it was interesting, even if I didn't necessarily follow all of it.
263532	263932	But yeah.
265252	267913	Yeah, it was a very... It's been a long project, though.
268034	271635	It's been for like... We've been talking about it since before the holidays.
271695	272875	The whole year, yeah.
273956	278178	So it's... Yeah, it's finally done.
278198	279878	Well, I mean, everything's pretty much done.
280939	286241	I say pretty much because I'm still tweaking stuff now, but that was basically my final episode of the season.
287461	291423	Just wanted to get that out in the last section of the ride, or the park out.
291783	292323	I've been doing small...
294640	296862	Not, you know, super important stuff.
296902	298324	Like, I built a bathroom today.
298644	299985	Like, a second bathroom in the park.
300005	303128	Because I'm like, it doesn't make sense to have a theme park with one restaurant.
303209	306011	I was like, you just threw up a bathroom in your spare time?
306071	310616	Okay, in the... If you want to be hilarious about it, you should make a queue for the bathroom.
312461	314421	Yeah, I could with armor stands or something like that.
314802	315702	I could do something like that.
315782	326847	But yeah, they've been just doing a lot of armor stand work at least recently just to kind of bring more life to the park and everything and just get ready for our world tour.
326907	338572	So we're going to be doing, we're going to have some larger streamers coming on I think on the 8th and then we're going to live stream with them and then we're going to open it up for just the community
339656	340317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
358988	361729	So people can go check stuff out and go explore it together.
361769	363710	You want that exclusive window.
363810	366992	You want to get the eyes on your YouTubes and your communities and all that stuff.
367032	367592	So it makes sense.
367612	371994	Yeah, because I mean, you know, YouTube's always counter to whatever I'm trying to push.
372054	377557	You know, it really... It really is like me on the weekdays.
377577	379838	Like, I don't want to do this.
380258	383100	Do I really have to push this video for you?
383700	384160	Like, it's...
385979	387486	It usually fizzles out pretty quick.
387506	389194	So far it's been alright, but like...
390071	390511	I don't know.
390731	392552	Like, it could be much better, too.
393152	393913	So, we'll see.
394373	397874	Alright, well, if you aren't checking out Loki's YouTube channel, you should probably get on that.
398515	403297	If you're a fan of just, like, not even necessarily Minecraft, but, like, amusement park rides.
404918	410640	Or just the meticulousness it takes to put together something of that volume.
410680	414061	I would say if you like Legos or any of that stuff, it's a very similar sort of thing.
414542	418684	Like, just, you know, you don't have to be a Minecraft pro to kind of look at that and go, geez.
419904	421545	What a nerd.
422506	424468	There was a lot of care put into that.
424688	428111	It's been two months straight on that.
429212	433015	Just to finish up everything, it was at least a solid two months working on that.
434737	442503	Even after the time lapse in the video, I still spent a couple more weeks polishing and testing and everything.
442523	443945	It was a lot.
445586	446447	It looks really good though.
446995	447436	Thank you.
447856	449217	And at some point... You're welcome.
449557	456463	At some point, I don't know how we push Loki's back catalog, but it's not like this is the first thing that you've built.
456523	457624	And you could still go back and look.
457824	463329	Because I know in the beginning of this, you kind of showed, like you said, I did like 200,000 blocks with this Mega Man build.
463389	466291	I did another... You were showing off some of the things you built in the past.
466351	471215	Because I think you were trying to get to the point where it was like, this is half a million, I think you said, blocks or whatever that it took.
471596	474958	And I was like, Loki's got such a rich library of these things that...
475899	478741	Like a lot of people haven't seen that really should.
478801	479681	And I just I don't know.
479701	486025	I mean, if we all knew YouTube for doing your job, if we all knew what the magic was to go viral, we would have figured it out.
486065	488026	But well, you just you can't.
488126	494070	I guess I did have one viral TikTok, but that's the subsequent one I thought was funnier.
494370	496892	And it only it didn't get a fraction of the views.
497252	500294	So it's it really is just like a hit and miss type of thing.
501484	530347	yeah it's a fun ride I think people are going to have a lot of fun checking it out it's funny as well so the main component of the ride is this thing called the lazy river it's essentially like this technique that a guy named Dingy Fried had come up with and basically it just uses water the flow of water to move a boat along a path
531087	538852	and so that's what kind of inspired the whole thing but Diggy Fried is actually a in real life he is a um
540157	544318	I don't know if he's a rollercoaster or theme park engineer.
544778	549120	He's actually an engineer for theme parks and rides.
549260	553401	I've been keeping him up to date with everything I'm doing.
553581	558622	He had nothing but the highest of compliments for the work that was done at the end.
560723	564924	That coming from a rollercoaster and theme park engineer...
565959	569122	I mean, that's all you need to hear, I guess.
569202	569963	That is pretty rad.
570063	570683	That is great.
570783	571444	Yeah.
571564	582694	Yeah, for those on the podcast that can't see the movie playing behind Loki, you know, I know when he describes it there, it doesn't sound very flashy because that really, that's just the core that everything else is built around.
582734	588719	But you have to understand, Loki's got this very intricate, like, you know, imagine like a blacklight ride at Disneyland or like a
589199	589760	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
612139	613180	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
633297	633758	videos.
633959	636524	I was going to do one of those in that ride.
636805	642477	No commentary, just straight experiencing the ride from queue to the end or something like that.
643243	666328	you know I know you've gone really heavy on YouTube and I understand why but you really ought to think about taking some of your shorts like some of the short thing and put them up on TikTok and I I have and they don't get that won't they get like at least 500 400 on there or do they not wow you're lucky I don't think in fact I should probably check but I don't think like the few that I've put up there have not cracked like
667441	694186	30 like it's it's interesting it's like nothing I wonder why I wonder if you just have to have a talking head in front of it you can't believe what this is I don't know whatever yeah dumb it down for everybody no it's yeah let's see here so it was I'm just out of curiosity I don't think it's done very well from what I remember looking at where's my account
694414	714436	but then I like TikTok is in a really weird place right now as we all know you know with the whole they banned it and then they didn't and then now it's like some it's looking like somebody might buy it the latest thing I was hearing is that Microsoft and Oracle might be putting in a bid which I mean it's better than some of these billionaires that have been in the conversation like I can't
715236	715496	MrBeast
730922	756973	like it's gonna lose the soul of what makes that thing tick and it's it's not gonna be the same and I think for a lot of people ever since the downtime a lot of people have been like it's just not the same because you actually you still can't download it if you don't have it already on your phone because one of my friends deleted the app because she was like well it's over she deleted the app now she can't get it back on her phone because uh all the app stores online will still not put it back up because
757633	759094	And I don't blame them to be quite honest.
759134	772401	I do not blame them because the government, especially one that is shown to be as fickle as the current administration that's now in place, I don't blame them for kind of not trusting what's coming out of their mouths.
772581	775103	Where it's like, we won't hold you responsible.
775123	776003	We're not going to monitor it.
776043	776463	Don't worry.
776904	778725	I don't blame anybody for saying that.
780165	784949	Not until you pass a piece of signed legislation where it is law are we going to believe it.
785289	786270	I don't blame them one bit.
786650	788671	But that's the situation we're in.
788711	792574	And now people are saying they're getting unfollowed magically.
792874	796036	The bugs are starting to show up because Fight Dance can't patch it.
796316	798038	So it's really just a matter of time.
798538	801820	So yeah, my most viewed video... I don't have that many.
801840	802821	I only have three videos up.
802861	804942	But my most viewed video is 48 views.
805102	806223	The other two are 14 and 12.
807444	808605	So yeah, not really...
810604	811085	Uh, good.
811706	812807	Loki, give me your login.
812827	813589	We're going to fix this.
813769	817474	I'm going to get in there and figure out how we can push these, make them stick.
818355	820158	I'm going to be your social media hype, man.
821179	821500	Alright.
822040	826367	I do want to do more on Twitch this year, but we'll see.
826926	829468	That's always a good place to do to really build a community, too.
829488	838816	But you do... I mean, we are all fortunate that we have the OLR community who has been very good at supporting the other things that we do outside of OLR.
838916	845902	But then, yeah, once you start to do your own thing, like DarkSakura has done a lot of work on the Dead by Daylight.
845942	848384	And I know you do other things, but let's be real.
848464	851007	You are embedded in that network of...
851607	854808	Full-time Dead by Daylight creators, you know, a lot of them know who you are and stuff.
854848	857989	And you get a lot of viewers that didn't find you through this.
858489	862211	So you kind of, you know, were able to build up another bubble.
862531	863771	You now have a Venn diagram.
864191	866932	You have your OLR people, you have your Dead by Daylight people, and you have both.
868133	873114	And I'm trying to combine the circles to bring my DBD people over to the OLR side of the force.
873334	875175	Yeah, but, you know, it is what it is.
875295	879877	Not everybody's available Sunday nights or has time for a two-hour podcast is what it is.
880117	881297	So, yeah.
882549	883170	Anyway, all right.
883490	885852	Enough about social media and networking and all that good stuff.
885952	892637	Let's get into how the video game companies are networking and promoting their stuff because they want these games to get more than 35 hits.
893158	896841	So, Loki, what is Xbox doing to promote their games this week?
897922	911751	Well, they did a developer direct where they covered kind of updates on four games, one of which was an unknown at one time, but we quickly found out what that was.
913192	919616	So, of course, I tuned in mainly for the Doom the Dark Ages stuff because that looked pretty awesome.
920957	923699	But yeah, we got kind of out of order here, so...
926502	934455	The big announcement obviously was Ninja Gaiden 4 is being developed by Platinum Games and Team Ninja.
935036	936559	So that looks pretty cool.
936919	938823	And then they're also going to be...
940675	945481	Updating and I guess remastering Ninja Gaiden 2 in the Black Edition.
945541	950086	They did that with the first Ninja Gaiden like back in the Xbox 360 a long time ago.
951468	959076	But yeah, it's going to be launching this fall on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
961840	966731	Yeah, Ninja Gaiden 2 was one of those, like, and it's out now!
967292	968635	So that was kind of cool.
968795	970579	On Game Pass, nonetheless.
970800	972583	I was tempted to install it the other night.
974249	975610	So that's pretty sweet.
976470	977991	South of Midnight still looks pretty good.
979412	986096	Granted, the initial stuff that we kind of saw about that game, I didn't really kind of understand what the gameplay was like or anything like that.
986496	988217	So it looks neat.
989418	992079	That's supposed to be coming out rather soon, actually.
992680	995541	So on PC and Xbox on April 8th.
996562	998443	So that's pretty cool.
998583	1001344	Expedition 33, which looks really awesome.
1001584	1003565	Yeah, that one's definitely got my attention.
1003605	1008146	I'm looking at our chat room and Quest Buster says Expedition 33 is definitely on my radar.
1008186	1009687	Quest Buster has great taste in games, too.
1009787	1011627	So I know that's I know that's right.
1012508	1014248	Yeah, my Deft is excited for it, too.
1014348	1015929	Yeah, really looks exciting.
1016069	1021939	Yeah, and that's supposed to be launching April 24th for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox.
1023361	1026847	Notice that all these games are coming out on PlayStation as well, you know.
1026867	1029471	Remember everyone was like, oh no, they're going to
1030097	1030958	Make it exclusive.
1031718	1034320	Oh no, they're going to sell more games on a different console.
1034340	1036201	I know, it's crazy.
1036281	1037922	Do The Dark Ages, which looks awesome.
1038042	1040644	That's supposed to be coming out now on May 15th.
1041564	1045227	PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox series as well.
1045787	1049089	And, I mean, it looks like a Doom game.
1049129	1049870	It looks awesome.
1050010	1051891	They're focusing on single player, which is great.
1052751	1053632	No multiplayer in it.
1055813	1056153	I'm down.
1056834	1057294	It looks good.
1057895	1058495	All of it looked good.
1061332	1063514	Are we surprised they didn't have a little more?
1063774	1065716	Like, you know, and all said and done, that's maybe like six games.
1065756	1072080	I think they only said there was going to be four games that they were covering, so it was kind of like, this is, I expected four, I got four, so...
1073522	1078843	Yeah, and I think I agree that, well, yeah, they set the expectations very clearly, which I think is good.
1078883	1081444	And I think for a January thing, it's pretty good.
1081464	1091146	And I think also it's like, okay, we know that this is going to be what carries us basically for this first part of the year until the announcements really start to roll out, right?
1091546	1097027	It's also, and I'm sure they didn't do this on purpose, but it's also one of those things that's very well timed because it's like, well...
1097367	1104291	If you're still sitting around waiting for the Switch 2, which isn't until April, hey, we have some things to, you know, get you excited until then.
1104352	1115619	And the other thing, too, I mean, the other thing, which is funny, is they could be making a lot of sales off of re-releasing titles for the Switch 2 that are Xbox titles.
1115699	1121162	And notice that, you know, these announcements and the release dates, aside from the fall release of...
1122563	1149743	Ninja Gaiden 4 which is still very early and all that stuff but everything else is just April and May so if the Switch 2 say were to announce that they're launching in June or something like that which would kind of be an alignment time wise from when they announced the Switch last time then maybe that's what's going to carry them through the summer is like oh hey here's Halo and here's you know Hi-Fi Rush and all that stuff you know
1151034	1168786	um yeah the fact that um we could have like Halo on a Nintendo console is so wild to me but like I really feel it now more than ever that like it's gonna happen we're gonna at least have the Master Chief Collection on the Switch too why not like why shouldn't we so
1169724	1170425	Very exciting.
1171186	1171386	Yeah.
1171707	1176993	So, yeah, it was it was it was a nice little like we usually don't get a lot of gaming news at this time of year.
1177133	1180137	So that was a very nice little thing to see happen.
1180517	1184222	So, yeah, it was good job for Xbox.
1184242	1187206	They've been you know, I know that I know a lot of people really feel like,
1187526	1209946	XBOX has been kind of like a solid third place and I understand I understand the reason why I don't you know again I think it's a weird contest I think the fact that Microsoft leans so much into PC and that Nintendo really kind of sits on its own and all that like I really feel like with so much of that like it's not it's not really the three-way race it feels like sometimes I really think it is just all three kind of running their own races and
1210326	1210847	in their different ways.
1210867	1213811	And I think Microsoft keeps trying to make that abundantly clear.
1214211	1216154	Like, they want to run their own race.
1216214	1218677	They don't want to run the same race as PlayStation anymore.
1219097	1220539	They have their own ideas.
1220639	1222742	Yeah, and the whole console wars thing anyways.
1223403	1228329	I mean, look at everything in society nowadays that we kind of...
1229130	1254055	boil down to like team like oh my team I want my team to win I want no your team suck you know like it's like literally in everything like can we just not can we like grow out of that leave that back in the 90s and early 2000s and just be like okay these are corporations they're releasing products which product do I want you know on which system do I want to play it on and just leave it at that
1255002	1282934	I wish it was that easy but unfortunately I worry that our entire country has gone this way in many ways and yeah I don't know I feel like politics is turning into that and that's kind of a depressing thing it's been that forever so I don't know so how can when it's so embedded in our culture how can gaming get away from that rise above that but then again well and I think people
1284515	1289177	and I think a lot of the executives at the companies are, right?
1289337	1295379	Like I think, you know, you hear and you've seen on social media the companies supporting each other in different ways.
1295479	1303462	We were talking a little bit at the end of Bobby Blackwell's show, another friend of ours in Independent Podcast, Gamertag Radio, celebrated 20 years.
1303642	1304523	So congrats to them.
1304543	1306003	That is absolutely no small feat.
1306624	1309965	And they had Phil Spencer on to celebrate and I believe Danny asked him about
1310325	1334433	The Switch 2 on that and he had a pretty friendly comment you know sort of response to that sort of thing and I feel like that like the internet and sometimes social media wants those sorts of like sports teams to exist in game console because some of our brains are still stuck in those 90s ads Genesis does what Nintendo don't and when it was a little bit more about that direct competition but now that we're talking more about
1334793	1338234	Cloud Gaming, and gaming on every screen and all that.
1338534	1341754	It's, I think, de-emphasized a lot of ways, the consoles.
1342234	1344435	Yeah, the consoles are important, but they're not everything.
1344775	1346475	The goal at the end of the day is to make money.
1346775	1351116	And if Microsoft can make money by selling you games on Windows, that's still a win.
1351536	1355797	If Microsoft can make money selling you a subscription pass, that's still a win.
1356617	1358858	That's what it is at the end of the day.
1359418	1359538	So...
1361314	1368724	Anyway, before you get into our gaming week, just looking at some of the comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network when we are taping live here.
1369465	1372008	E3VL says, social media doesn't help due to grifters.
1372488	1375232	Oh yeah, there's so much fake shit on social media.
1375312	1375652	It's just...
1376914	1406014	you just and yeah and just like the clickbait stuff that is meant to give an emotional response like you know this is why there will be those sensationalist YouTube thumbnails that are like Xbox is struggling here's here's three here I'll give you a perfect I bet you this video is out there right now and I'm not even looking I bet you it's out there right now top five reasons why Microsoft is struggling in 2025 you're not gonna believe the number two reason
1407512	1417595	Like that is going to be, that's the type of shit that they rage because Microsoft fans are going to click it and go like, I want to see what full of shit this guy is, you know, whatever.
1418016	1421597	And then Sony people are going to click it going, fuck yeah, fuck Microsoft.
1421617	1423637	It's like, it's so ridiculous.
1424038	1425058	It's so ridiculous.
1425618	1428199	Yeah, QuestBuster says the outrage economy is awful.
1428599	1433981	We all owe a part to do better and not give in to that outrage bait.
1434441	1439123	You just have to recognize your outrage is a product.
1440544	1441464	Sell it sparingly.
1444052	1447133	Let's see other comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1447433	1454756	Bons006 on a lighter note, now the good sides of gaming and fandom, saying people I know attended MAGFest 2025 this weekend.
1454796	1456817	Yeah, some people I know attended MAGFest too.
1456857	1464700	And of course, YYR was on our show last week talking about MAGFest and I re-bleeded something he posted on Blue Sky because we are on Blue Sky at Orange Lounge Radio.
1464840	1468862	We have a domain name on there because not everybody is BSkySocial, but we are Orange Lounge Radio.
1470763	1487471	and he's showing super multitasking there or super duper multitasking and the snake I'm sorry I forgot the actual name of that game but it's the snake refresh game that he's doing that's I think focusing on the arena snake arena or something like that and
1488311	1489733	and it looks like MAGFest was a lot of fun.
1489793	1491916	My friends that were there were talking very highly of it.
1492637	1501989	Apparently ran into one of the performers in the elevator, had no idea who it was but just had like a really good conversation and then went to that concert and saw the person on stage going, oh...
1503971	1507614	But that happened to Bobby and I at DragonCon once.
1508134	1514439	We were riding the elevator on Wednesday, and we were just striking up a friendly conversation with this guy.
1514519	1517841	And we noticed that we each had attending professional badges.
1517881	1522004	And we were like, oh, yeah, we have this podcast now where we do these long run gaming shows.
1522064	1522865	It's like, what do you do?
1522905	1528509	And he's like, oh, I wrote a book series called, and I'll let it be a secret.
1528969	1533413	And I was like, oh, I think they just made that book into a movie, if I'm not mistaken.
1533973	1535594	He doesn't like the movie, for the record.
1536954	1538515	That's another reason why I'm not going to name it.
1540176	1541336	Or at least I got that impression.
1541396	1543377	I should say, allegedly, I got that impression.
1543677	1545438	But maybe it was a bad moment type of thing.
1545838	1550680	But it's, you know, you never know who you're going to run into at a con and just strike up a conversation with, right?
1551421	1552841	So, fun stuff.
1553202	1555323	Anyway, MAGFest looked like a lot of fun.
1556263	1558004	I'm not ruling out going again.
1558124	1561685	There was a time when I was like, no, I don't think I'm going to ever be able to go again.
1562206	1562946	But, um...
1565164	1568847	I might want to go again sometimes.
1569387	1569787	We'll see.
1570268	1574650	I kind of want to make it happen, even though it's early in the year or something like that.
1575671	1578453	February would have been a better time, but maybe I can make January work.
1578633	1578873	Maybe.
1579874	1584777	But I do feel bad for the people that went this year because everything else that was going on in DC this week...
1585680	1591564	which no matter what reaction you have when I say that, you recognize that it's traffic nightmare.
1591984	1594666	So people had to go out very early for that sort of thing.
1596607	1598668	Ranma, I'm thinking about it for next year.
1598708	1601951	There's a lot of factors, a lot of unknowns, but I'm thinking about it.
1602531	1602991	So we'll see.
1604492	1610576	All right, anyway, let's talk about how our gaming weeks were and the type of things that we were playing this week.
1610656	1611397	Since we weren't
1612678	1616741	Um, since we weren't at MAGFest this weekend, how were we spending our gaming weeks?
1617182	1618143	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1618203	1618763	How was your gaming week?
1620464	1622186	Um, it was pretty busy.
1623127	1626970	I played, um, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1627010	1633555	I'm trying to work through the, uh, the, whatever the chaos shuffle is going on right now.
1636370	1661206	I played Dragon Age Veilguard I played Pallia I've played Fruit Mountain I don't know why I'm addicted to Fruit Mountain but I love it I have a Mahjong game that I like I've also been playing the Suika game because I love my puzzles and just like bibs and bobs here and there a couple of classic things just testing games out really
1663167	1670775	and I've actually been doing some Dragon Age, not Dragon Age, but some Dead by Daylight 3D renders.
1671676	1676281	So having fun with my 3D rendering software again.
1679864	1680265	Good times.
1681707	1684888	I've only seen a little bit of the Dead by Daylight chaos shuffle this time around.
1684908	1689290	I guess I haven't been watching as many Debbie streamers as last week.
1689851	1690331	I should.
1690531	1691131	I really should.
1691511	1693172	I haven't played Debbie in quite a while.
1693232	1696554	I think I'm like missing a bunch of characters now and stuff, which is fine.
1696894	1699895	I feel like I don't need everything, but yeah.
1700676	1703557	But I've been sucked into another game, but I'll get into that a little bit.
1703597	1705178	Let's talk to Loki in the meantime.
1705198	1705838	How was your game of the week?
1706616	1715219	Well, as I previously mentioned, I've just been working on stuff on the Channel 64 SMP, just getting ready for the world download stuff.
1715900	1724363	And of course, this week is putting out video and everything, so editing and getting the last minute things ready for that.
1725263	1749854	now it's nice to have a little bit of pressure off and just work on like some of the dumb it's not even dumb but it's like detail stuff that you don't necessarily need to see in video so like some things I did for our guests when they come is Liv had created some custom models for balloons so you can carry balloons around in the park and so we have a balloon vendors that I made and
1750174	1750715	DarkSakura.com
1769255	1772878	Just because it's like, oh, they just made sense to have this here.
1772938	1775000	And he also fills a blank spot in there.
1776161	1780124	Just, yeah, trying to like find things to like fill the gaps and just add extra.
1780144	1792675	I get another extra layer of polish on top of everything for the final tour and world downloads to try to impress our guests as much as we can and anybody else that ends up seeing it.
1793777	1795418	And then getting ready for next season.
1796198	1802261	We're looking to start probably the 15th or mid-month of February.
1802861	1804862	So I'm looking forward to that.
1805362	1821170	And probably we'll start as soon as I'm... Usually one of the things when you release a video and you've worked a lot on everything, you kind of have this downtime afterwards where you're just brain-fried, where you can't really focus on...
1822602	1836848	the next big thing or creative part so at some point that once I get past that and done fiddling with the park I'll probably start designing stuff or planning out the stuff for next season because the game that I'm building there is
1838353	1841156	It's gonna be massive, massively complex.
1841717	1845502	Because I'm trying to show those big creators I can hang with them.
1845702	1848525	I mean, as it is, I think I've already done that, but, you know.
1848565	1849527	You absolutely have done it.
1849607	1852951	It's just, the viral thing just haven't clicked.
1852971	1856595	And we all know, we all know half of this success is just luck.
1857492	1859193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1878035	1883079	I want to say, well, I don't know how much I want to get into it because I don't like to talk about things and bring them to light.
1883199	1885901	And, you know, because then it just, you know, is basically free advertising.
1886281	1890184	But apparently there was a YouTube thing that got a lot of feathers ruffled this week.
1890505	1893147	And there was just a lot of people involved.
1893167	1898771	That's just it's just it's a clown car full of creators where you look at it and go, why are these people famous?
1899351	1899672	You know what?
1899712	1899852	No.
1899932	1900632	I will name names.
1900652	1901393	Because I'll say one.
1901453	1902033	I'll say one.
1902434	1908138	I never understand how this person is famous and why we still even... We talk about him a lot less.
1908438	1913442	But Dr. Disrespect, I will never understand why that guy was famous at all.
1913762	1919366	Except the fact that some people are drawn towards those edgelord personalities.
1919907	1923409	Like, that's a 40-year-old man in a wig, Maury.
1923610	1925751	Like, what is edgy about that?
1925871	1926372	Like, I don't...
1927816	1932540	Yeah, I had, like, a co-worker that liked him a while back.
1932580	1944771	I don't know if he still does, but, like, I think beforehand it was more of, like, kind of just, like, a character, but then he started just going off on the deep end and is like, okay, it's not.
1944831	1948975	And then, I mean, in the more, like, recent Minecraft space, like...
1950265	1952167	Dream, and that whole nonsense.
1952207	1953989	Like, I just wish he would just disappear.
1954210	1956692	Like, honestly, it's so annoying.
1956812	1959215	Anytime that he's brought up, it's never for a good thing.
1959736	1960757	It's always something.
1960797	1963860	He's always got beef with somebody over something.
1963880	1966763	It's like, just... Like, you're in your mid-twenties now, man.
1966804	1967104	Like, just...
1968134	1968735	Grow up!
1969115	1969756	Exactly!
1989585	1997710	But again, with the outrage, I mean, I see a lot of news articles on these people and it's just like, oh my God, did I hit some type of algorithm I do not want to be on?
1998170	2000392	But again, don't give in to the outrage.
2000752	2002953	So it's just, yeah, annoying.
2003553	2010798	Fun fact, if you long press on a TikTok video, there's a button that says not interested and you won't see that topic nearly as often anymore if you do it.
2012833	2014795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2038055	2056628	but it is one of those things where I'm like damn I really wish they would just see this out as a full class because it is fun and it's doing what these seasons do when they are best and it's shaking up the metagame with like a brand new system that sort of challenges you to play different ways than what you would normally do that are easy
2058105	2060466	I'm playing a barbarian and it's a lot of fun.
2060586	2064106	Legendary farming is so easy this season, which I actually think is a good thing.
2064447	2073729	Some people think it takes away, but I think the way the codex is built now, I think it takes a lot of the farming out of that stuff to get the ultimate fixes for your gear.
2074029	2082010	And you just really can focus on pushing pit levels and pushing all the things that have built up in the game over the seasons.
2082030	2084351	Because now we have infernal hordes are permanent and
2084571	2113558	and now we have these new things that I bet are going to stay in the game the head what are they called the head hut dungeons or what I can't remember but there's like a special like new type of side dungeon you can do that is is like a mix of the infernal hordes and this new thing and it's just it's great I love that they are having all of these game types mixed in so yeah Diablo 4 has been dominating my gaming week I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 because a friend of mine really enjoys it I haven't played it a lot but I've been playing to check out the game with him and
2113858	2133992	and um I've been doing retro games because I finally finally even though they built this so to make it easy it was still difficult for me but you can all be proud that I finally got emu deck up and running on my steam deck and it is uh it's a game changer to be able to play Super Mario Kart while I'm lying in bed love it
2134412	2162854	which is what I've been playing I've been playing that and I don't know I just played some other random shit like Donkey Kong 3 just like random shit that pops up but Mario Kart is the one where I'm like okay I want to focus on like building my save file to have actually beaten all the cups in this game and do the stuff I used to be able to do as a kid try to beat some classic games like I said I was going to do earlier this year yes Bobby says I can play Super Mario Kart while lying in bed because I have a Nintendo Switch well mine has achievements
2164485	2179870	which I know don't fucking matter for some people but it's it's a nice it's a nice thing on mine so all right um otherwise that's pretty much it for my gaming week so let's continue on get into some gaming news Loki we're gonna go to you
2180990	2200577	Yep, so the devs behind Celeste have cancelled their next game, which was Earthblade, but unfortunately it's because they had a fallout between some of the team members and also realized that the game's development has become a real slog.
2201537	2210745	For us, on the inside, we've had some time to process, grieve, and work towards accepting this, although the process is non-linear and still ongoing.
2211125	2218431	For those only reading this now who might have been emotionally invested in this project, we're sorry to disappoint you.
2220533	2223575	I don't remember this game, but the trailer looks cool.
2224616	2225917	Looks very Celeste-y.
2227338	2228800	Well, the trailer's all you're ever going to get.
2228820	2229220	Yeah.
2229929	2231710	Yeah, well, yeah, yeah.
2251135	2251715	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2267324	2269805	at least that were relevant to what they were doing and put them in a new game.
2270165	2272467	That's what will happen.
2273367	2276048	And this isn't really the best example, but I'm going to give it anyway.
2276409	2283512	Like when Blizzard was working on that Titan game, not Titanfall, that was a different game, but Titan was the name of the project.
2283872	2289095	And then they canceled it, but they kind of took one of the most interesting elements of the game, which was supposed to be
2289515	2293158	Going Down to Planets and Competing for Resources, something.
2293458	2294759	That turned into Overwatch.
2295279	2301963	So they took the one element of the game that did kind of work, and then they made this whole new game out of it, and that was Overwatch.
2302004	2310929	Because originally, it wasn't supposed to be like Tracer, and it was supposed to be like Assassin, and they had more, like Team Fortress 2, ironically.
2310970	2312591	But the whole game was very different.
2312951	2316853	The whole game itself was not what Overwatch ended up being, but it was, yeah.
2317014	2317194	Yeah.
2317894	2319015	Still how that can go.
2319095	2327123	So, you know, hopefully something, the fertilizer that this situation has created hopefully can grow some more flowers in the future.
2327604	2329365	Not to be too cheesy, but you want to be hopeful.
2330046	2335531	Mike Deft in chat reminding us it was announced either at Summer Game Fest a few years ago, if I recall correctly.
2335611	2336532	So yeah, one of the fests.
2336572	2340136	I do remember it was showed up at one of the fests some time ago.
2340957	2341918	So it's a bummer, but...
2342790	2344851	You know, especially with how popular Celeste is.
2344891	2350593	Like, if you are a hardcore platformer, Celeste, platformer person, Celeste is a real challenge.
2350913	2351813	Thank you, Orange, right?
2351953	2353074	It says it was the Game Awards 2022.
2353954	2356895	So it was somewhere in the Keeleyverse, Deft.
2356915	2357476	You were close.
2359236	2360977	So, but yeah, that's a bummer.
2362597	2366498	Also a bummer was the unexpected downtime of Marvel's Snap.
2366698	2383103	So you might remember last week we talked about this, but Marvel's Snap got caught up in all the TikTok drama because ByteDance technically was a publisher of the game, even though I don't think they actually were a publisher anymore, but they kind of got caught up in the carnage and all this stuff.
2383183	2387664	So the developers at Second Dinner, which by the way, I love that name for a company.
2387704	2387864	Yeah.
2388864	2391386	Second Dinner has... What about Second Dinner?
2392027	2393448	It's Taco Bell.
2393468	2394729	It's giving you Second Dinner in-game.
2394749	2395970	I don't know about Second Dinner.
2398131	2407339	You get a reward package to folks that were either directly impacted by this, but even if you have an account and you haven't played in months, you can still benefit from this.
2407799	2412463	So if you are in the US, you will get the Global Gratitude Package.
2413083	2415044	for dealing with the outages.
2415924	2429690	Marvel Snap is back online, by the way, and it's supposed to be... I'm sorry, the game itself is back online on PC, and it is expected to be restored in the major app stores later this week.
2430471	2435453	Second Dinner is also, quote, working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher.
2436113	2440255	The current publisher, of course, is Nuverse and that whole tie-to-byte dance thing.
2440515	2441936	DarkSakura, have you ever played Marvel Snap?
2463312	2463692	Oh, no.
2463932	2464993	I've watched Nick play it, though.
2465153	2466914	Okay, yeah, I've seen a little bit of Nick playing it.
2466934	2467575	Well, here's the thing.
2467795	2469116	Maybe somebody can translate.
2469797	2474761	If you have reached collection level 500 or over... Okay, Fifth Dream, tell me what this means.
2475201	2475982	Collection level 500.
2476182	2478684	I'm assuming that is some sort of level in the game.
2478884	2482367	Like in Pokemon Trading Card Pocket, you also have a level.
2483007	2510095	You get two spotlight keys, 5,000 XP for the season, 4,150 credits, 6,200 collector's tokens, 1,000 gold, five gold conquest tickets, three infinite conquest tickets, 4,000 conquest medals, one mystery variant, six premium mystery variants, one cosmic red border, super rare, three cosmic gold borders, super rare, and 155 times five random boosters.
2510235	2510495	Okay.
2511567	2514709	That does sound like a lot of shit, but I need to stress something here.
2514749	2521152	And Fifth Dream, as our resident Marvel Snap fan that I'm picking on, feel free to set me on the right track.
2522413	2525535	This sounds like a problem of too much fucking currency.
2526215	2529337	There's like, exactly what Bobby Blackwolf says in chat.
2529577	2530538	How many currencies?
2530698	2533119	I'm going to add a word that Bobby Blackwolf doesn't use.
2533399	2535741	How many fucking currencies does this game have?
2537250	2541094	because that's my initial thought as well.
2541394	2547620	As I've been playing World of Warcraft recently and I saw an article on this too, World of Warcraft has a lot of currency bloat in it.
2547721	2553046	Now, it's a different type because you pay your monthly fee for World of Warcraft.
2553066	2555929	You don't really pay for currency on top of that.
2556009	2557691	I guess there is a shop in the game
2558151	2558571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2579105	2580245	and E3VL is right.
2580506	2584447	Pokemon TCG Pocket is adding new currencies next week.
2584787	2586848	That game has a ton of fucking currencies in it too.
2587288	2588889	It has like the gold.
2589209	2591290	It has the card hourglasses.
2591410	2593050	It has the wonder pick hourglasses.
2593410	2595671	It has the trans rights shop badges.
2596031	2597772	It has the, I say that because they are
2598132	2623103	Trans flag colors, so you can't convince me it's anything different, it's a trans rights message in that game, so there's the trans rights shop tickets, there's the limited time shop tickets for each event that goes on, there's the shine dust for the cards, so I guess what I'm saying is I have no room to talk because the game I'm playing is the exact same fucking problem people
2624093	2631155	But to be fair, 5th Dream and Chat says, some buy cards, some upgrade them, some give you chances for more cards.
2631515	2637937	That actually sounds very similar to Pokemon Trading Card Pocket, actually.
2640077	2644599	Yeah, and then Trading Card Game Pocket is supposed to get like two new booster packs next week.
2644919	2648620	And I think that's, oh yeah, trade currency is going to be a thing too, I think.
2649360	2649540	So...
2650799	2653121	I thought you got actual cards at McDonald's right now.
2653161	2653861	I thought that was the thing.
2653881	2654242	I don't know.
2666411	2672316	Shane had sent me a picture getting a McDonald's Happy Meal, and it was Pokemon-themed, and I'm like, of course you did.
2672356	2678902	He's like, well, I eat Happy Meals anyway because it's a portion control thing, which actually makes a lot of sense.
2679022	2689611	If you are like, I don't want to binge too much at McDonald's, a Happy Meal is a decent, you know, even though it's for kids, you know, you get a smaller portion and you're not binging too much.
2689631	2689932	Yeah.
2690706	2693928	It's actually, believe it or not, I'm just going to throw this out here.
2694548	2699111	It is actually what a recommended serving size for an adult is.
2699271	2700891	Yeah, yeah, for sure.
2701992	2703873	Tell me what that says about, you know.
2706414	2714519	Well, yeah, I've heard that thing where like if you go overseas and you order a large soda, you get the equivalent of what's like a small to medium here.
2715039	2716500	And that's a large overseas.
2717737	2719781	Because they're actually using legit serving sizes.
2719901	2720422	Yeah, for sure.
2720622	2720883	For sure.
2721824	2723307	And, you know, Americans.
2724202	2726523	Um, so E3VL says there's both.
2726783	2730905	So you get a code that gives you a 24-pack hourglass and a 12-wonder hourglass.
2731385	2735407	You have to download the McDonald's app and opt in for email to get code.
2735607	2742410	I do have the app because everybody fucking has a reward programs app so they can push notification you all the details.
2742730	2744191	That's just the world we live in now.
2744231	2748333	It's the new type of marketing things is push notifications, so...
2749213	2750114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2766505	2767525	What does DoorDash do?
2768086	2770867	It'll send you a push every other day.
2771287	2772248	Aren't you hungry?
2773848	2776790	25% off Panda Express right now to your door.
2776910	2777910	I haven't done any of that.
2778030	2779971	I've gone into my preferences and turned off marketing.
2781114	2782135	Yeah, I've turned off a lot of stuff.
2782155	2783335	I swear mine is off.
2783415	2784916	I always turn that stuff off.
2785116	2786677	No, I still get that stuff, yeah.
2787038	2787278	Yeah.
2787778	2788819	Hmm, I'll still look into it.
2789099	2792521	But I swear I turn off that stuff, and I get that.
2792681	2794001	I definitely turn off the tracking.
2794462	2800285	I'm very thankful that iOS has all that tracking stuff now that you can just turn off, but it's annoying.
2800745	2804347	All right, anyway, less annoying, actually really great news, DarkSakura.
2806248	2806809	So, yeah.
2808230	2808890	Um, uh,
2810689	2815612	The Video Game History Foundation has done us a thing.
2815752	2817773	It has opened its digital archives to the public.
2817833	2820475	Well, it will be next week starting on the 30th.
2821395	2827839	So, it's still a work in progress, of course, but it has, like...
2828639	2834060	It's basically one of the largest libraries out there about game preservation and game history.
2834600	2842562	It has over 1,500 issues of out-of-print gaming magazines, promotional material, other game development assets, you name it.
2843222	2849384	And it's going to be... Yeah, it's going to be available for everybody.
2849964	2850324	Although...
2852523	2867138	It's still, you know, trying to fight against the, you know, DMCA issue going on with that, but it's still, it's going to be though limited just to visual assets.
2867559	2868880	So, but that's something.
2869461	2869621	Yeah.
2872040	2877685	That's really cool that they're putting that all online and game preservation is a hotter topic more than ever.
2877805	2884070	So it's nice to have some of that media and all that preservation all online as well.
2884330	2885971	I'm excited to go check it out.
2885991	2891476	I know Archive.org has a lot of that, but it'll be really neat to see what else BGHF brings to the table.
2891756	2900103	And something Bobby had pointed out when we were talking before OLR tonight, which I didn't realize, is that the BGHF is going to be searchable.
2900663	2901364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2922910	2929078	Yeah, well, you know, we talk a lot about EA and discontinuing games and stuff like that.
2929158	2931441	Well, now they're discontinuing an app.
2932102	2935586	Remember how they wanted you so badly to sign up for Origin?
2935666	2939492	It was another stupid launcher that you had to use, and it's just...
2940728	2956057	It's been absolutely irritating ever since Well, now And Origin used to be Origin was a name they picked up because all the old Ultima games were under Origin So Origin used to be a cool thing and then they kind of stole that name for something less cool
2956437	2965239	They stripped, they wore the skin like a husk and, you know, molded it into a shop instead.
2966239	2969440	Well, now EA's Origin app is going away.
2969500	2971120	It's being closed down forever.
2972421	2981383	And instead, you're going to have to be, you have to use the EA app instead, which also apparently is terrible and only works on six...
2983417	3010625	yeah it only works on 64-bit machines so if you want access or if you want 32-bit versions of your games I guess you can't so that sucks if you're on a really old PC hardware I guess other than that though I don't know why you'd be on a 32-bit version of Windows exactly like most software today isn't
3011408	3022459	I think, well, I know that Mac OS hasn't done 64-bit since, like, five OSs ago, and I think Windows eliminated it, what, two ago?
3024141	3025642	Windows 10 had it prior to 2020.
3025802	3029426	It had a 32-bit version, so after that, it's only 64.
3030916	3039264	If you have an older computer, which maybe, you know, with your resources, finances, maybe only a secondhand type of thing, or like a laptop, I could see too.
3039324	3043188	You might have like an old laptop or something, if that's the only type of thing that's available to you.
3044149	3050055	You know, and I would think, and SSG100 Matt in chat says, so no Sims on 32-bit machines.
3050095	3052197	And I feel like that's the franchise.
3052677	3052917	DarkSakura
3069557	3098356	you know and that's that's the people that are going to get hurt by this I will say this there is I know there's an app for it on the Mac it doesn't work very well but there are apps that emulate 32 bit and 64 so they exist there's ways to get around it but they're not always reliable I don't know anything about them running on PC I wouldn't you know
3100066	3102729	I don't know about that, but they exist.
3102950	3108437	Yeah, and if Origins is going away, it wouldn't matter if you could get a 32-bit environment.
3108477	3108877	It's gone.
3109338	3112302	It's just not their responsibility to keep supporting it.
3112562	3112723	Yeah.
3115045	3118006	Again, a bummer for those who may have more limited access.
3118046	3132369	I understand it's a narrow sort of scope, but I feel like somebody will pop up and say, this is how... I remember we used to have a listener pretty actively that was like, I only play Nintendo 64 games because it's all I have access to.
3132429	3133289	Am I still a gamer?
3133449	3135530	And I'm like, fuck yeah, you are.
3135710	3136810	Everybody's resources are limited.
3136830	3137270	You just play a game.
3137410	3138011	You're a gamer.
3138411	3138831	Exactly.
3139691	3139791	So...
3140799	3146083	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell says Sims 3 still works on 32-bit machines, but the DRM to launch it is going away.
3147044	3160654	So I wonder, I mean, again, I don't know how big this audience is and this whole thing, but I wonder if this goes down a route similar to The Crew and Ubisoft, and there's actually a class action suit going on because of this.
3161434	3184245	and I don't I you know again I'm not I'm not trying to be too hysteria on this thing and I understand the majority of people are on machines now that run this but I I can't help but feel like there's going to be somebody in middle of nowhere Alaska that's playing The Sims no offense to Alaska but that's playing The Sims on their old ass laptop that now is no longer going to be able to play and that it's like why did I buy this game that I can't play anymore
3185563	3212582	I don't know I can't help but feel like something happens there but maybe maybe I'm just being sensationalist I don't know I'm sure it's I'm sure it's all in that user agreement that none of us read and we all accept because we want to get into the game that they can in fact do this I'm I'm pretty sure that's the long and short of it but those agreements have never stopped a class action from happening and getting challenged in court anyway so we'll see
3213973	3214433	We'll see.
3214873	3217314	Well, something else that might be headed towards court.
3217394	3220335	This is a pretty wow type of situation.
3220355	3223476	I'm still trying to understand it as a player of this game myself.
3223937	3229079	I hadn't heard of it until today when we're scanning news trying to figure out what's going on for the show.
3230279	3233240	So Final Fantasy XIV apparently has a mod.
3233700	3237141	So a user-created mod that is having a lot of issues.
3237542	3239342	And it should be stressed, this is a mod.
3239402	3240743	And Final Fantasy XIV does not...
3241643	3242703	really endorse mods.
3242743	3246584	In fact, they really frown on you using them and they can threaten to ban you over them.
3247005	3270391	And it's a really kind of mucky area because originally, when Naoki Yoshida first took over Final Fantasy XIV, he had said a long time ago they wanted to someday be able to support mods because, of course, one moment, sorry about that, he was really inspired by World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft, of course, has mods upon mods upon mods.
3271405	3279615	but then he sort of realized that he didn't want everybody to have damage meters and be kicking people from groups because they didn't hit a certain spot on the damage meter.
3280036	3283720	He didn't want it to be that kind of culture so he ended up not having mods.
3284040	3287985	That doesn't mean people don't have the damage meters anyway but you're not supposed to talk about it.
3288835	3292858	They're a little harder to get into the game than WoW, which makes it very easy.
3293399	3300864	Anyway, setting all of that stage to say, now there is this mod and the director, Yoshida, is going so far as to comment on it.
3300944	3302546	It's a mod called Playerscope.
3302926	3306088	It was made last year and it was put up on GitHub.
3306429	3311933	But people didn't really know about this until Reddit started shining a spotlight on this.
3312733	3314575	Because apparently what happened...
3315135	3325904	is that a recent change in the software itself by Square Enix, what they did, it was actually supposed to improve blacklisting features, which in its nature is a good thing.
3326004	3332009	So let's say, let's say I was going to go nuclear and block Jamie in Final Fantasy XIV.
3332049	3333911	I would never do this, but I'm just using this as an example.
3334291	3336433	Let's say I block Jamie in Final Fantasy XIV.
3336853	3343318	This new feature, it doesn't just block the character she's on now, but any character she makes in the future, blocked.
3344540	3346341	That's how the new blacklist works.
3346822	3351366	So that's supposed to help in people not being able to contact you from any character.
3352147	3360456	But unfortunately, it sounds like the way this was built on the back end, this mod was, for lack of a better term, able to exploit Blacklist.
3360993	3374264	So Naoki Yoshida on the Lodestone, which is kind of the news forum for the game, wrote, We have confirmed that there exists third-party tools that are being used to check Final Fantasy XIV character information that is not displayed during normal gameplay.
3374804	3388796	The tool is being used to display a segment of a Final Fantasy XIV character's internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same Final Fantasy XIV service account.
3389918	3393664	and basically he said there's two ways that we can see we can fix this.
3394926	3399533	Number one, request that the tool in question be removed and deleted.
3400745	3407228	That's very nice, but also I think very ignorant of once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet with all respect to Yoshida.
3407968	3422655	And then number two, pursuing legal action, which I'm trying to think of when mods, I mean, I guess there have been time when mods resulted in legal action because I want to say some of these adult ones have ended up in court.
3422895	3424896	Well, I think they get settled before they ever get to court.
3425336	3432918	but I'm very curious to see what they had to do because a lot of the player base is saying this isn't good enough.
3434058	3436959	You know, some comments saying this is a joke, I expected more.
3437399	3453704	You should actually fix the actual issue which allows the functionality of such stalking mechanisms which I'm assuming is going to be a rollback of that blacklist functionality so that it works the old way and you don't, you know, now if I block Jamie she could just roll an alt
3454324	3456746	and then, you know, bully me on another account.
3456766	3457447	We'd do it too.
3459269	3459869	I know you would.
3459910	3462052	I know you would.
3462272	3464134	As I should be bullied by Jamie and only Jamie.
3465976	3466997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3489417	3490678	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3507285	3531453	what are they really able to see outside of the names and perhaps gaming media is suppressing this a little bit because they don't want people to find this and use and and I can understand that I can understand that there's certain things that you don't want to shine a spotlight on but I was even trying to like comb the reddit posts and things like that and I wasn't really seeing like is there something else there that's like really really bad like are you seeing people's
3531733	3533297	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3543900	3555932	This is still something that's being worked on and I have a feeling just having played 14 for a long time and watching the way Yoshida works, the player base that's screaming is going to get what they want and this is probably going to be rolled back.
3556793	3564020	And it sounds like a lot of this probably needs to be handled server side rather than player side, which I think is one of the other big issues right now.
3564780	3570324	Um, and again, I'm not sure how that all works because I wouldn't use a mod like this.
3570404	3571244	I have no use for this.
3571985	3581211	Um, but I, yeah, just, I went, when I kind of saw it in the perspective of, okay, let's say Jamie is a big streamer.
3581231	3583392	I don't know why I keep picking on Jamie, but I'm going to.
3583792	3584973	Jamie is a very big follower.
3584993	3585894	He's picking on me.
3586574	3588015	Jamie's a, now who's getting bullied?
3588455	3592136	Jamie is a really big Final Fantasy XIV streamer.
3592676	3596318	And she, you know, she has 200 viewers at a time.
3596998	3600779	And, you know, she plays on this character, but she only plays this character when she's streaming.
3601300	3608602	Otherwise, she has her non, you know, she has her street clothes character, for lack of a better term, that she wants to play when she doesn't want to be bothered.
3609002	3614605	But this mod will show that, so that unfortunately, creepy boys...
3615925	3624510	and folks that can message this person going, hey, you were looking pretty good on your stream earlier, which is unfortunately what bad people do.
3627132	3627252	So.
3628507	3630348	I can see where people are really bothered by this.
3630388	3645114	I'm not trying to minimize it by my own lack of ignorance as to what this tool really does because I don't think I want to understand what it does other than the fact that it is important to comment on it and figure out how we can fix it and move beyond it.
3645195	3652338	But I just feel like at this point, they may have to just roll back to what it was before, even if it's not optimal, at least until they figure it out.
3653618	3658421	I even think legal action is on the internet, Yoshida.
3658521	3672468	If you don't put something in the code to stop this mod from working, then they're just going to patch it and it's going to live on in these shitty discords full of shitty people wanting to do shitty things to people that don't deserve it.
3674608	3675528	StarSakura
3701607	3703448	Yeah, so something I actually have signed up for.
3704089	3707211	Sega has an online account service called a Sega account.
3707751	3713735	And you can sign up now to get bonuses for like a dragon pirate yakuza in Hawaii.
3713995	3714415	Excuse me.
3714815	3715436	Excuse me.
3715956	3716617	You get a suit.
3716877	3717277	Excuse me.
3717777	3720539	Wouldn't that be a Sega account?
3722360	3722640	Yes.
3722961	3724141	Or a Sega account?
3725782	3726063	Sega!
3726763	3727203	That's right.
3727263	3728204	It's a Sega account.
3728224	3728404	Thank you.
3731386	3746343	um so uh it basically allows you to play Sega and Atlus games online and receive goodies you know like for example the pre-order bonuses uh the special uh cosmetics stuff like that um
3747344	3749244	I'll go ahead and just read the quote directly.
3749364	3758506	Sega has launched a Sega account and online profile that gives you access to a host of benefits while playing Sega and Atlus titles and using their online services.
3758606	3763908	By creating a Sega account, you'll receive the latest news about Sega Atlus games, events, and promotions.
3764068	3770629	Additionally, your Sega account grants you access to exclusive bonuses and the ability to link accounts on various gaming platforms.
3771249	3781682	Right now, you can link PlayStation, Xbox accounts, you can link Steam, you can link Nintendo Online.
3782142	3785406	Epic is not there yet, but it says coming soon.
3787808	3800439	And if you create your account and fulfill the requirements by March 7th, 2025, you get an in-game bonus for Like a Dragon, Pirate Yakuza, and Hawaii, which launches on February 21st.
3801360	3803281	So yeah, and it's a suit.
3803622	3804522	I'll just let you know it's a suit.
3805343	3808626	But hey, why not?
3809687	3810307	I made mine.
3810668	3813230	I have a bajillion accounts for everywhere anyway, so why not?
3815233	3817634	Get that free stuff when they launch it.
3818075	3818795	You know what, though?
3819255	3822037	You know what this whole Sega account stuff has me thinking?
3822897	3841546	You know how there's these rumors, rumors that the reboots of games like Crazy Taxi and Jet Set, you know, I think we've heard the rumblings of these reboots and that they're going to be online, they're games as a service, or they're like Battle Royale, Crazy Taxi.
3841566	3841967	There's a leak.
3842867	3854750	There's a leak from Atlas, on the Atlas side, that Crazy Taxi and Jetstar reboots are games as a service, and there are remakes in development.
3856210	3861972	The person, Midori, is in Karakara.
3862812	3863432	Sorry, Hirakara.
3864132	3867495	Yes, it is modeled after AAA live service games such as Fortnite.
3867515	3870278	There are plans for live events, collaborations, and customizations.
3870758	3877704	The current plan is to create a live service game as a service reboot as well as a remake of original Crazy Taxi.
3879105	3880606	And there is a link.
3881327	3883349	And this is why you're going to need a Sega account.
3884591	3885852	I think, ultimately, yes.
3886012	3893896	I think this is what it is, because especially if it's one of those, it's going to have a battle pass and all this other crap, then this is going to allow it to be portable from system to system.
3894376	3896357	So, yeah.
3897637	3902500	But I also believe those rumors were saying that it's a Nintendo Switch 2 thing.
3903339	3904120	S, Actdeft,
3924520	3938351	Pretty high on that, especially with this coming out now and them encouraging people to sign up for it is to get it locked and loaded for when these games ultimately roll out, which may be as soon as whenever the Switch 2 releases.
3939271	3939672	May, June.
3939692	3941053	Yeah, we'll see.
3941253	3941513	We'll see.
3943266	3947108	All right, Loki, you got something for us, which people were actually over in our Discord server.
3947148	3950490	They were talking a lot about this this week over at VOGnetwork.com.
3951170	3952011	A neat little device.
3952311	3961896	So the Retro Remake Company has actually put out a pre-order for something called the Superstation 1.
3962856	3967119	It is a FPGA PlayStation console.
3967739	3968199	What?
3968219	3968620	What?
3989394	3995476	and, you know, internal storage of like 64 gigabytes store, I guess, ROMs and stuff on there as well.
3995556	3999198	Outputs to 1440p or 1536p, depending on, I would imagine, HAL or NTSC.
3999278	3999498	And then...
4006480	4029554	On top of that, you also have compatibility, and they're also taking pre-orders for the SuperDock, which is going to be a device that sits on the bottom of the device, and it's a physical CD player that will read PlayStation 1 discs and also give you the opportunity to store more data on there as well.
4029594	4035678	It's got four USB ports and an internal M.2 slot so you can put more storage in there.
4037093	4037393	That's cool.
4037413	4039556	It looks like a little, it looks like the PlayStation Mini.
4040477	4041198	It's cute.
4042179	4042620	I like it.
4043541	4049769	I like how the logo, that transparent blue one that got midnight blue or whatever, that thing looks cool.
4050309	4051931	Is that R-squared or R2?
4051952	4053533	Because then that makes me think of the R4.
4054234	4055436	So there was some interest.
4055977	4056177	Go ahead.
4058324	4060305	Does it say anything about region locking?
4060405	4062967	Does it have anything about CD switching?
4063627	4065989	I don't think it's locked at all.
4066169	4067590	I think I know the answer to that.
4067770	4070872	Speedmania would be kind of difficult.
4071032	4073214	There was some talk about that in chat.
4073234	4080178	So essentially, my understanding is that this is really just an emulator in a very pretty package.
4080238	4082840	When we have that whole discussion about why don't you just set it up?
4082880	4084721	Why are you buying an NES Classic?
4084761	4087083	Why not just set up a Raspberry Pi and attach it to your TV?
4087703	4090024	Like this is, this really is that.
4090164	4093725	It's an emulator in a very pretty package, you know, that whole thing.
4094506	4114873	And I remember a couple of weeks ago on the show, maybe it was a month ago, I was kind of talking about how I feel like we have all of these clone consoles that are coming out now that technical patents are expiring because we have things like Super Nintendo, Nintendo, Game Boy, Mega Drive, you know, you have all these consoles.
4115293	4119276	But I was going like, why aren't we seeing these for PlayStation and that sort of thing?
4119356	4120236	And then it hit me.
4120937	4126861	Because where consoles are now, it's not just the console that has to be emulated.
4127401	4128442	It's the BIOS.
4129022	4130163	That's the key thing.
4130563	4135546	The BIOS, or basically that structure that kind of loads first.
4135907	4138148	And the Sony one is infamous.
4138188	4139709	When the BIOS is loading, you see that...
4143011	4164851	is that me going through the loading noises right or if you didn't have a disk in the drive the BIOS was the thing by default that would allow you to play audio CDs and that whole thing that's the BIOS because that's software that isn't subject to the same law so I think that goes under the general public domain law of 95 years before those BIOSes go
4165251	4174778	So that is my long-winded way of saying, I think if I remember right from what I saw in the discussion over on Discord, and those of you live in chat can set me straight on this because I can't use Discord to read right now.
4174978	4176079	Well, I could bring it up on my phone.
4176519	4180923	But I believe you have to put your own BIOS on it.
4181943	4182264	So...
4184142	4191548	So that's my long-winded answer to your question, Jamie, is that it would depend what BIOS you put on that, whether it would play Japanese games or what.
4191989	4195011	I'm sure there's some type of hacked BIOS that plays them all.
4195051	4196433	I'm sure that's a thing at this point.
4196953	4208063	But the company can't actually endorse that because that BIOS is the thing that's still protected and why we're not seeing PlayStation clones and PlayStation 2 clones and things like that.
4208423	4215469	until now because now all of these drive-based systems have a BIOS to read the contents of that.
4216350	4217931	So, yeah.
4218272	4222175	Oh, SGO100Matt says, there are plenty of ways to get the BIOS without getting your own.
4222695	4223256	Absolutely.
4223416	4223856	GitHub.
4226158	4227960	Yeah, there's absolutely ways.
4229201	4230382	It looks cool.
4230422	4233004	I think if I was going to...
4235376	4235716	I don't know.
4235936	4238718	There's a lot of PlayStation 1 games that were pretty fun to have.
4238778	4240019	I think it's a neat little device.
4240259	4242360	I would like to see more of these things in the future.
4243501	4244501	More readily available.
4244742	4248023	Can I get one of these in a shitty mall kiosk or something?
4249664	4250525	The mall or something?
4251573	4252714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4270286	4271567	It's a fancy emulator.
4271727	4276730	You're legally obligated to own a real PS1 and dump and provide a BIOS copy from it.
4277031	4279652	And there's a little screenshot from the website.
4280033	4282034	We bring the party, you bring the games.
4282514	4287037	Superstation does not ship with any built-in games or copyright material.
4287418	4296304	The base system supports playing backups of PS1 games and ROMs for other systems via the included microSD or via a USB drive.
4296764	4298485	Disk support and additional I.O.
4298525	4299886	can be found in the SuperDock.
4300367	4307940	I wonder if... I feel like some PlayStation emulators don't actually require you to have a BIOS because the emulator has its own BIOS.
4308821	4309502	I think...
4310731	4320541	And again, I could fully be wrong here, but I think that might also be what this is doing, is that it just it has its own custom BIOS to be able to allow these games to be powered.
4320561	4324184	It sounds like I think you probably have to add a BIOS to it somehow.
4324325	4329149	They're just not going to tell you how to do it so they can be legally protected, which I'm fine with that.
4329350	4330411	I mean, this is the Internet.
4330451	4331632	You can figure it out.
4332272	4333354	Yeah.
4334274	4334755	But yeah.
4336498	4357484	a neat little piece of kit yeah Bonds006 says not gonna lie there's a solid lineup of PS1 games I would play again and first time one of my friends just bought a copy of Bust a Move the other day for like no small amount of money but now has a copy of that to be able to play the actual disc so it's very exciting I just think like I'm like because now with my kids going right
4358686	4360567	Yeah, oh yeah, the Japanese, yeah.
4361148	4377799	I was gonna say, now, like, with, you know, my son going through, like, Nintendo 64 stuff, and, you know, kind of enjoying some of those older games through the Switch emulation, you know, you know, the officially sanctioned stuff through Nintendo Online, but...
4378619	4396305	you know enjoying all that stuff and even like the physical older systems like the Wii and stuff it'd be cool to like have this and like do like you know Twisted Metal 2 or you know have like I don't know like a lot of those old games I used to play yeah it'd be fun
4399349	4405131	Yeah, as Joe and Matt says, they're putting it out right on the site and not saying, play your collection of PS1 games out of the box.
4405191	4409112	I'm not seeing it as deceptive as 13 Forever feels it is.
4409573	4413494	So, you know, I think it's important to know what it is you're getting.
4413574	4418156	I absolutely see his point, though, of like, it's just an emulator in a fancy shell.
4418636	4419896	It's a hardware emulator.
4420076	4424998	FPGAs are better emulators than, I think, software emulators, at least.
4425438	4427499	I think those are the more preferred methods.
4427899	4434504	And it's like you said, it allows it to be set up really easy for your kids and stuff, which, you know, that's cool.
4434764	4438186	I'm not going to, you know, again, I'm not here to tell people how to spend their money.
4439127	4443810	And if it's a nice little decorative thing for the shelf because it's pretty and stuff, why not go for it if that's what you want?
4443830	4445451	I'm going to tell people how to spend their money.
4445551	4446011	Give it to me.
4449074	4451855	Oh, what a lead-in to our next story.
4451995	4452276	Okay.
4453539	4454339	I just want to preface.
4454820	4456260	I can't fucking stand this guy.
4456460	4458041	And you all know I can't stand this guy.
4458141	4460542	And I don't know why I'm sitting here talking about him on OLR.
4460662	4461183	Oh, I do.
4461643	4466505	Because this guy likes to force himself upon gamer culture and any opportunity.
4466785	4467806	And we're going to get into that.
4468126	4471308	Unfortunately, I want to talk tonight about Elon Musk, okay?
4473028	4477410	The owner of the website formerly known as Twitter.
4478371	4478651	The...
4480832	4481614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4495814	4518099	I want to make very clear how he's grifting gamers I think that's why I want to talk about it because there are gamers out there that are falling for this grift hard on X and I need people to snap out I know they don't listen to this show and really could give a fuck what I have to say I'm sure this show is too woke or whatever bullshit they want to say for them but I need gamers to understand Elon Musk thinks you're a tool
4519153	4524156	and this whole situation is going to show you exactly why.
4524837	4531101	So as you know, he claims to be the world's best with Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2.
4532041	4537025	And he was kind of denying the whole account boosting thing and all of this stuff.
4537605	4543189	But then basically various YouTubers and various people that know these games very well
4544549	4544989	Elon's map.
4573570	4577791	It's obvious somebody is running the account for him.
4578292	4592036	Yeah, my favorite though had to have been when he was at the inauguration, it was live and his account was in playing Path of Exile 2 and it was like running maps or whatever in that.
4592397	4596638	So it's like, but you're here and your game is being played here.
4596698	4599319	We clearly see you're not on a computer here.
4601462	4614979	Well, what I want to know is who was running the vibrating panties during that whole thing because he was sitting there the whole time going... I'm sorry to those on the podcast feed, but I'll just let you imagine the face I made there because... He's on...
4616963	4618123	Drugs, allegedly.
4618243	4619244	Drugs, allegedly.
4620824	4621524	All right, anyway.
4623545	4623925	Let's see.
4624085	4628887	And now some DMs that he exchanged with a YouTuber known as Nico Rex.
4629487	4630667	What did Nico Rex do?
4630907	4638910	Published him, of course, in a January 18th video called Addressing All the Elon Musk Drama in Path of Exile 2 with Elon Musk.
4639270	4645532	He shares screenshots of DMs where he basically said, oh, he said they were okay to publish.
4645692	4645712	I...
4648684	4662492	he admitted to using account boosting to compete with Path of Exile 2 and Diablo 4's endgame but said there's nothing to apologize for because everyone's doing it that's not true that's
4664524	4668987	Ask the hardworking staff of sites like Icy Veins, Max Roll.
4669467	4670188	Sorry, I'm leaving out.
4670208	4671028	Those are the two I know.
4672269	4677973	Those guys and folks, you know, they played these games a lot in order to be able to write these guides.
4677993	4679453	You should just ban his accounts, then.
4680174	4681475	I really wish they would.
4681755	4688819	But I think, to be fair, he's not the only one that engages in this practice, and whatever action they take should affect everybody.
4688859	4690800	But yeah, it's DarkTetsuyaSaysInChat.
4690840	4692221	He's full of shit, you don't say.
4692922	4693002	Um...
4694238	4697000	So NicoRex asked, have you level boosted?
4697060	4701163	Had someone else play your accounts and or purchased gear resources for Path of Exile 2 and Diablo 4?
4701683	4704405	He said 100% with that emoji that says 100.
4705586	4709509	It's impossible to beat the players in Asia if you don't as they do.
4710249	4713972	Like... Well, then don't come out here and say you're the best player ever.
4714012	4715433	You say you're just lying anyways.
4715513	4716134	It doesn't matter.
4716194	4720957	Like, if you wanted to do that casually and not make a deal out of it, then that's fine.
4720997	4722018	No one would care, but...
4724044	4737651	So if we can all agree that he is lying about his ability or stretching the truth tremendously, buying his way to the endgame in these games, we'll say, why would he want to do that?
4738571	4743594	Why would he want to put on the ruse of, I'm one of the best Path of Exile 2 players in the world?
4743734	4744695	Why would he want to do that?
4746616	4748477	Because he's still trying to...
4750322	4756244	Be this, like, hero in the eyes of all these people, and he's an idiot.
4756704	4762287	And so he fakes, essentially, all these achievements.
4762507	4765188	But then, like, on top of that, he's like, oh, yeah, I did cheat all that.
4765268	4765668	So, like...
4767751	4781185	you're right especially in the first half of what you said I mean you're right on all counts but what I wanted to focus on is what you said there in the first half there he thinks that people will believe it and he thinks that it will buy him clout with gamers
4782006	4783428	And that's important to know.
4784148	4791757	And this holds up with that pattern of why did he buy Twitter in the first place and dogpile it into the ground?
4792277	4800306	Because he wanted to own that town square where people were discussing things and he wanted the conversation to be about the topics that he wanted to talk about.
4801708	4816620	He wants gamers to believe his stuff like it's going to get him some type of cred with them so that gamers are more likely to respect him and put him up on a pedestal and think, oh, this guy is so good.
4816881	4821464	I want to be just like him and be a hero or whatever.
4821685	4826369	You all need to understand Elon Musk thinks gamers are morons.
4827608	4829568	to be pulling off something like this.
4830309	4837690	If you're a gamer, Elon Musk's actions are showing here that he thinks you're an idiot and that you're easily influenceable.
4838090	4854214	And to be fair, if you want to go off of certain trends that happened on Twitter that were disgusting a few years before he bought it, things like Gamergate, I'll just call it out, that's probably the whole thing that made Elon Musk feel like Twitter was something he wanted to own.
4857017	4861101	So everybody that participated in all of that has some ownership in this, quite frankly.
4862542	4866406	Mike Deft in chat says, I think Elon thinks most people are idiots, not just gamers.
4867407	4879899	You're probably right, but this is the crowd he can very easily get to because, again, what I was just talking about with who showed they were easily influenceable on Twitter a few years before he bought it.
4881861	4882141	Mm-hmm.
4884788	4892230	SheHulk10 in chat says he's another ketamine-fueled rich kid, allegedly, like Trump and his grades in school are hidden from us.
4893110	4895391	So it's – yeah.
4895831	4898551	Def says, funny enough, I was talking about this with a coworker the other day.
4898871	4902612	There's a lot of people talking about him right now, and it's really not all good.
4902932	4904393	And good.
4904993	4905333	I just –
4906263	4906863	You know what?
4908064	4915948	All these countries that are calling him out, it's time to ban X. Free speech and all that stuff.
4917349	4925554	I'm not saying we have to ban it in the US, but we need other countries to show up and show out because I don't know about you all, but again...
4926294	4937198	There is one person making money or not barely breaking even, losing a little money at this point if leaked memos are to be believed, at the website formerly known as Twitter.
4937278	4938218	That's Elon Musk.
4939058	4942299	That company is no longer publicly traded.
4942959	4950242	There is no one else that stands to gain from that profit but the guy who got up there and gave a Nazi salute at a political rally.
4951198	4953820	and now is joking about it.
4953840	4961607	Instead of apologizing, saying, I was trying to do the Roman salute, which, by the way, is literally the same thing.
4961667	4962568	It is the basis of it.
4962608	4969414	But instead of coming out and saying, I made an action that I regret, instead of admitting his mistake and saying-
4969754	4971135	I did this thing spur of the moment.
4971155	4972516	This was not my intent.
4972556	4974317	And I'm so sorry it came off that way.
4974637	4975958	I was really trying to do this.
4976239	4979401	But unfortunately, where there's smoke, there's fire.
4979561	4983163	And what is this guy continuously looking at supporting over and over again?
4983884	4984965	That line of thinking.
4985305	4992390	So yeah, when he does something like that, it makes a lot of people go, wow, he's really showing his true colors right now.
4992910	4998554	And especially when his joke or when his response is to come out and say, oh, it's a joke.
5002432	5004253	It's not a joke to a lot of fucking people.
5006114	5008816	But you all still want to have a Twitter account.
5010337	5010617	Okay.
5011757	5018881	And I mean, I mean, what I really mean, not anybody here listening to the show or anything like that.
5019502	5025685	I mean, why is AOC, and I love her and I agree with a lot she says, why the fuck does she still have a Twitter account?
5026546	5028127	It's time to get off that website, AOC.
5030549	5052508	and every everybody he's been problematic lately too I just y'all need to get off that website anyway that's my rant thank you the whole the whole problem with that is as long as people think that that site is going to oh all my people are there how often have I heard that excuse mm-hmm
5053627	5056089	If they're your followers, they'll come with you.
5056749	5064455	And honestly enough, I kind of like having switched over to Blue Sky for the fact of setting kind of a reset.
5065696	5066217	You know what I mean?
5067778	5074443	And having those better lists and being better able to curate what's on there.
5075944	5079647	Honestly, it's much healthier there, I think.
5082278	5106908	that was kind of the same reason I got off of Facebook years ago before this most recent pile of shit but I am no longer posting on Instagram if you really my people are over there, my followers are I have to have a place to announce all this and blah blah blah and I went through this too, so I'm calling myself out on this
5108067	5111930	It shouldn't matter if you are going to take a moral stance.
5113852	5119917	So you have to decide how much of a moral stance you are willing to take or where you're ready to compromise your morals.
5121618	5122698	DJ Ranma S is saying...
5150525	5175369	it brings a lot of people in for content creation I know people who won't leave because other social media sites don't have enough users for the change this is all I'm going to say at this point you now have all of the information you now have all of it and you know who makes money off of that if that is not enough for you I really don't know what else to say but I will not be seeing your content on that website that's for sure
5176550	5182632	So Ranma says, moral stance or financial stance, there's a reason why Twitter still has a lot of content creators on there.
5182812	5191215	And actually, believe it or not, I was playing Dragon Age last night and an NPC said a line that made me think about it.
5191896	5198218	It was like, well, I could live in a shack or I could, you know, clean up after the Venatori.
5199202	5203026	who are the major bad guys supporting the evil gods in that game.
5203366	5207971	But I was thinking about this sort of like a real-life scenario, too.
5208171	5210333	And trust me, I get it.
5211354	5219742	There has to be a depth of conviction and, I would say, some sort of fallback.
5219782	5223025	And there really isn't a fallback for some people, not yet.
5224946	5237278	Some of the people that I am seeing on Twitter who are saying these things aren't really that big anyway.
5237698	5238799	I'm not that big.
5238900	5239720	I made the move.
5240501	5243284	There's other avenues.
5243304	5243504	Yeah.
5245999	5247520	and... TikTok's back for a bit.
5247620	5248241	You got that.
5248661	5250242	And if you think this... YouTube's out there.
5250322	5250963	You got that.
5251023	5257467	Yeah, and I also want to put out, if this is like, you know, you're just not wanting to get on Blue Sky, if there's a Blue Sky issue that's bothering you, cool.
5257567	5259929	Like, go to Mastodon is a great choice as well.
5259969	5261330	I don't got a beef with Mastodon.
5261670	5262331	It wasn't for me.
5262791	5265432	But I don't got to be for that if that's where you want to go.
5265913	5268294	It's another decentralized network, which I think is great.
5268854	5272536	Instagram has that whole pixel fed, which basically runs on the Mastodon engine.
5272676	5281880	I set up a pixel fed, but yeah, there's not a lot of engagement right now because unfortunately, as great as Mastodon is, it suffers from that.
5282040	5284581	It's not easy to just get up and running.
5284621	5289263	And that's something that Blue Sky fixed really quick with what they have.
5289564	5289804	Yeah.
5290484	5292825	Anyway, yeah, Tiger Claw brings out an interesting point.
5292885	5300288	A lot of big companies aren't making the jump to Blue Sky due to having deals with X. I read that the NFL forced some of the teams to shut down their Blue Sky accounts.
5300688	5304710	So, on one hand, I understand that they have, like, contractual agreements and all this other stuff.
5304790	5307311	On the other hand, fuck these contractual agreements.
5307331	5309992	Like, fuck the fact these contracts are even being signed.
5310572	5313173	Unless that was something... It's like something to do with ad revenue from one area.
5313193	5314034	It's just ridiculous.
5314114	5314814	Anyway, all right.
5315794	5316455	Back to games.
5317655	5319436	Let's talk about classics.
5319476	5329483	So before we get into the bumper for this week, I want to allow a little space here for DarkSakura to mention the 2025 twist on the classic game of the week.
5329943	5332305	So Jamie, what are you going to be doing?
5332325	5334206	I know you've kind of thrown out a few ideas here.
5334586	5335407	What is the official...
5336167	5336987	What is 2025's twist?
5361841	5364083	Home to Arcade Classic Game
5389218	5396545	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5396986	5399588	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5400289	5403412	All right, Jamie, what is the first one to start us off for 2025?
5403452	5403813	Home to Arcade.
5409770	5414035	So yeah, it is also known as Umjammerlammy Arcade.
5414595	5418760	It's an arcade that's based off of the Umjammerlammy PlayStation game.
5419721	5423304	You play in versus mode using controllers that look like guitars.
5424812	5453848	and uh it also has you know I the all right the site says that it was adopted by the Guitar Hero franchise no they took that from um Guitar Freaks so anyway going back to this um so it was uh done by Namco and Sony of Japan and that's where the arcade version came from it had updated graphics and new songs in addition to the original songs um I remember Arcade Infinity Rob
5457205	5457545	I do.
5458246	5459447	That's when I got to play this game.
5459487	5460128	We have played this.
5460968	5461209	Yes.
5462690	5475101	So anyway, and there is actually an archive of the game's CD on the Internet Archive and some of its assets on the Parappa subreddit.
5475441	5482487	So moving forward, the description of the game, I'm just going to read the official description.
5483448	5485929	Rock your way to the top of the pops with Um Jammer Lamy.
5486410	5496414	From the mind of Rodney Greenblatt, the brilliant designer of Parappa the Rapper, comes this cartoon-inspired musical competition starring Lamy, the stylish and clever lamb guitarist for the band Milk Can.
5497635	5504458	This two-player arcade cabinet converts the PlayStation title into an arcade experience with a set of realistic guitar controllers.
5505359	5510941	The game features three difficulty levels, three playable characters, and three game modes, solo, team, and battle.
5511822	5512042	Ahem.
5513548	5521677	Anyway, so basically from milkcan.com, which is I think defunct now.
5523059	5526822	Introducing the one and only Joe Chin Musical Instruments Guitar and Table.
5527442	5530244	Lots of time and effort seems to be put into its development.
5530284	5533346	As you can tell from its name, it can be used as a table most of the time.
5533526	5534066	No, no, no.
5534106	5535267	Don't use it as a table, folks.
5535307	5536127	The product is great.
5536167	5538148	It's kind of like a guitar and a turntable in one.
5538629	5547854	You can find the well-known OXAH buttons in the center and we created a slideable Joe switch on its neck and a turntable like a chin switch at the end.
5548655	5550916	So, I mean, basically the guitar is like a weird bop-it.
5551677	5551757	Um...
5553968	5554889	So let me find where I was.
5554949	5561673	Those of y'all who rules the Gatarn table, rules Um Jammer Lamy now, the arcade version.
5562113	5570098	In other words, even if you're the coolest at home, you need to rule this Gatarn table to be number one, so hurry now and start practicing, y'all.
5571879	5572879	So anyway, this came out in 1999.
5572919	5573119	And it...
5581089	5587333	By the way, it was re-hosted on the new Namco website, but it's just kind of weird, this controller was.
5587893	5593777	So anyway, it doesn't have the best...
5596238	5601841	Playability, I should say, but it had some bright colors and artwork on the frame.
5602561	5607444	It says with the header, Joe Chin Presents Super Guitar and Table Game.
5608444	5610065	The game was actually changed to System.
5610085	5611386	The left side is Lammy's.
5618377	5646671	and the right side is Rami's picture which was her alternate version in the Teriyaki Yoko level and it had some extra songs and one of them was the audio track for Parappa's version of I Am A Master and You which was in Um Jammer Lami and it was on the soundtrack but it was only playable in the arcade so
5649598	5672547	and uh it also dispelled a rumor that Parappa was supposed to be holding a feather duster at the end but he holds the same vacuum like uh like Lammy does um it came out on September 4th 99 and hopefully I am reading this hopefully that date was American style um and they uh
5675110	5700312	it was interesting it showed at the JAMA arcade show on September 11th and 12th that year it runs off a System 12 board and it's just like the Versus mode except for the big change you play it with a guitar-like controller from Namco's Guitar Jam so you can't really play Parappa very well
5701353	5706476	Um, but they had planned on, like, redoing this as another home port, and that didn't happen.
5707357	5712960	So, um, yeah, it's... It's some jammer lami with a guitar.
5713160	5714321	I mean, with a guitar controller.
5714941	5717843	It's kind of weird how you have to stand to play it as well.
5718643	5719384	But, I mean...
5720638	5721900	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5736584	5763959	because I'm short you can even see in the screenshots of the game you see the typical Playstation controller symbols but then you see a J so there's another thing I'm going to link you real quick Rob I'm just going to message it to you it's actually a Japanese reviewer playing it I didn't use it to begin with because honestly they talk over it and they're not very good but let me
5764759	5765699	Send that out real quick.
5765719	5767280	It's just fascinating, though.
5767380	5769881	I love stuff like this, even if it's not very good.
5770241	5770682	So there you go.
5770782	5771362	I linked it to you.
5771622	5773283	Okay, I will work on bringing that up.
5773843	5774563	Bear with me, folks.
5774783	5775924	I'm sorry if you get ads or anything.
5775944	5776504	It's not my fault.
5776524	5778065	Totally your fault.
5779425	5780005	No, not my fault.
5782747	5786408	But it's like... One moment while I get that.
5786448	5791050	I need a way to blank this scene real quick without showing everybody's messages.
5791090	5791810	Hold on, we're going to do that.
5791971	5792511	Okay, there we go.
5794083	5797826	Sorry, I'm not really set up for... Oh, I think I just showed this one, actually.
5798366	5798646	You did?
5798666	5799527	I didn't see, sorry.
5799747	5802009	Yeah, I searched it because I was like, she's talking about the guitar.
5802749	5804150	She's talking about the guitar and I don't...
5806892	5813173	Yeah, I don't really watch the video that much when I'm doing this, but there's like some... In fact, I'll just go ahead and do this.
5813393	5817354	I will link where some of my information came from.
5817974	5818675	It's just some of it.
5819795	5831717	But there is a full picture of the machine itself, and it is a height of 7'2", width is...
5834818	5836600	at 8.28 feet.
5837580	5839802	So it's a tall machine.
5840763	5842244	So it's like lurch-sized.
5842864	5843144	Yeah.
5844505	5848648	But yeah, it's pretty... It's alright, you know, it's Marvel.
5850169	5850670	So there you go.
5851682	5872494	Alright, there it is, your classic home to arcade game of the week, Um Jemma Lammy, now I'm also going to say I've been on a real Parappa kick for like the last month for some reason I don't see a problem with that, it's a great series I wish there would be another game Yeah, just the music is stuck in my head Alright, we still have some other headlines we want to talk about, what?
5873634	5874495	Get your chainsaws on
5875806	5881829	We have some other headlines we want to talk about in a segment called Rapid Fire News Loki, what else is going on in the industry?
5883009	5894134	We have the announcement that Arc System Works is bringing over Super Technos World River City and Arcade Classics It's all the Kunio-kun stuff
5895607	5913538	and yeah so includes some of the titles that they have looks like Super Dodgeball, the arcade version of that, Kunio Kunio Dodgeball for Super Famicom let's see, Downtown Nakatsu Baseball yeah
5916262	5918183	A lot of these are all Japanese games.
5918503	5932589	Combat Tribes, Super Famicom and Arcade versions, China Gate, the Arcade version, Shadow Force Arcade, Dunquest, Amazin, Fujin, no, Densetsu for Super Famicom.
5933289	5934469	Yeah, looks cool.
5935010	5936170	And no word.
5936390	5936850	Oh, here we go.
5937010	5940172	It's coming to PlayStation 5 Switch and PC April 24th.
5943533	5961862	so we'll have to see what the full lineup will be when that comes out finally and then of course we talked about that Sonic 4 was already kind of confirmed but now we have a release date for it too the movie not the game yes because the game already happened it was kind of yeah yeah
5963406	5987945	yeah so Sonic 4 is set to hit theaters March 2027 and I think they're probably going to greenlit even more movies after this because it's made them a ton of money so yeah looking forward to it I mean we already knew this was coming because they teased it at the end of the last movie and they had greenlit the movie before the third movie even came out I think but yeah it's done incredibly well
5989525	5992746	So now there's just going to be a whole Sonicverse of movies.
5993667	5994667	Well, there already is, really.
5994687	5995648	Three movies is enough.
5995688	5996988	The Sonic Cinematic Universe.
5997028	5997548	That's right.
5999549	6002710	I just wonder maybe if there will be a Sega Cinematic Universe.
6002751	6005952	Can we somehow combine Sonic and Crazy Taxi or something?
6005972	6007492	I mean, maybe.
6007893	6008753	It could be cool.
6008813	6013295	I want it to be the adventures of Opa Opa across the Sega multiverse.
6016024	6016304	I love it.
6016324	6023007	I'm trying to think if we heard of any other Sonic or Sega games that are going to become movies.
6023867	6024747	I don't remember, though.
6024788	6028949	Well, there was the Yakuza series that just happened, right?
6028969	6029569	Yes, that's true.
6029649	6031950	I don't think that got super well received, to be honest.
6035252	6036872	Yeah, it'll be interesting.
6036992	6037413	I don't know.
6038633	6038913	Maybe.
6039073	6040694	Maybe see some spin-offs from that.
6041294	6042335	It would be kind of cool to tie in

6149666	6154407	Nintendo Switch Online has a classic that just got added this week.
6154487	6158608	Fatal Fury 2, of course, was on the Super Nintendo, had a version there.
6159088	6163889	You know, maybe not as great as the Neo Geo version, but they made a fairly decent port.
6164849	6189366	on the Super Nintendo that was available and that is now out this week so you can check that out also being added Super Ninja Boy is being added I think I remember renting this game once I don't remember thinking it was very good but you know if you want to come to your own conclusions there you go that game is available now as of this week and then there's another game which I'm not super familiar with it's a game called Sute Hakun um
6190627	6213228	which is a Japanese game which looks like a little bit of a puzzler like I noticed the character is kind of like moving blocks around and it kind of I'm getting like Mylon's Secret Castle kind of vibes from this which I know is an obscure reference yeah right but like it looks like oh he's changing colors and like when the brick is red it goes up and down and when it's blue it goes left and right so that's okay that's interesting neat neat
6214611	6241063	so hey I'm I'm all for more classics especially ones uh from Japan that we never got to play I'm all for more of those showing up over here uh Japan also got sorry I don't know my YouTube settings to mute are not saving so I don't know why so sorry about that but um Japan has these games actually look different that just got added there's um Cosmo Gang the Puzzle
6242972	6244593	Oh, I remember that one.
6244613	6247414	13E, Rally, Big Run, Angelico.
6247494	6249474	And then I don't recognize this first game.
6251255	6253135	I don't know what this game is.
6254576	6255336	Jamie, I don't know.
6255356	6256416	Oh, you don't have the video anyway.
6256436	6257637	I don't know if you'd recognize this either.
6258057	6259737	Somebody might know which game this is.
6259777	6262118	But yeah, Japan looks like they have some different games to hit this week.
6262198	6262738	So that's cool.
6264459	6264719	All right.
6264919	6265539	Yeah, sorry.
6267438	6271863	Let's move on to some release dates of games coming out around the world.

6294407	6298330	Neptunia Riders versus Doggos.

6312191	6312851	I don't think so.
6312911	6313871	I was thinking like Manos.
6314211	6316812	Titan, Doggu.
6316832	6318372	Is it doggos?
6318552	6319432	I don't know who doggos are.
6320192	6321233	Anyways, doesn't matter.

6481170	6482711	That is out in Japan this week.
6483292	6485934	So that series is still going all these years later.
6486875	6490898	I've been thinking about downloading an RPG Maker just to start playing with it.
6491018	6491479	Yeah, why not?
6492159	6497400	Important clarification, talking about when we were mentioning Neptunia Riders versus Doggos.
6498100	6500561	Doggos are actually dogs.
6502362	6508403	It's like the combination of slime from, like I say, a Dragon Quest game and a little dog.
6509343	6510163	It's a dog slime.
6510664	6512004	So they are Doggos.
6512458	6512838	DarkSakura
6542591	6569321	just a handful on the 27th we have Star Wars Hunters Early Access Cuisineer on the 28th for Switch on the 30th we have Marvel's Spider-Man for PC Phantom Brave the Lost Hero for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5 on the 31st we have Citizen Sleeper 2 PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series and also on the 30th Hello Kitty Island Adventures for PC
6569841	6588006	FYI, this has already been available on Mac for like a year and a half And in Steam, I think No, I take that back, it was on Mac Yeah, I think it was originally an iOS game It was Apple Arcade It's an interesting, I mean it's a cute little game
6590018	6590459	All right.
6591019	6596763	Well, we have one more story for you, and then we'll open up Listener Roundtable, which I think we do have one email this week.
6597243	6597884	So we'll get to that.
6597964	6598344	We do.
6598384	6599145	I have it open already.
6599505	6599765	Awesome.
6599965	6600826	But first, Loki.
6602157	6611084	Yeah, so Minecraft, they do these collaborations with different IPs all the time, and now this time they've got Hello Kitty and Friends.
6611144	6611644	Yay!
6611764	6623113	So you can get DLC that has Sanrio characters, you can build farms, grow crops, raise animals, all sorts of stuff, and yeah.
6624094	6629458	Yeah, you can check that out, and I don't believe the DLC is free, so I'm going to go buy that stuff, but
6630498	6631159	It is available.
6631379	6639771	Well, Loki, I'm going to need you to buy this and I'm going to need you to rebrand your entire ride that you worked so hard on to be a Hello Kitty ride.
6640572	6645319	Well, unfortunately, it's in Bedrock and Bedrock sucks when it comes to Redstone.
6645539	6645840	Damn it.
6647520	6648821	Yeah, I'm not going to be able to do that.
6649662	6650042	All right.
6650162	6651264	Fine, fine.
6652245	6654127	Not right now.
6654187	6655308	Maybe later on.
6655368	6660854	I had thought of doing an Animal Crossing season, but I don't know.
6660874	6661134	Oh, okay.
6662115	6662516	Be cute.
6663477	6663737	All right.
6664862	6668903	Mike Deft in chat says, Hello Kitty, Minecraft, and Island Adventure the same week?
6669204	6669584	Awesome.
6669924	6670444	Yeah, right?
6671344	6674025	Who knew Hello Kitty was going to dominate the news cycle this week?
6674165	6674505	All right.
6675606	6678627	Anyway, as promised, it's time for the listener roundtable.
6678667	6680748	We invite you all to participate with us each week.
6681028	6685109	You can give us a call on Discord if you want, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6685149	6687070	If you head on over to the green room, we take calls there.
6687950	6691596	I have heard that Twitch does embedded calls now.
6691616	6692878	I think it has for some time.
6694280	6697865	I might want to see if that's an option available to us in the future.
6698005	6698426	We'll see.
6699487	6701150	But for now, we're still sticking with Discord.
6702199	6722682	Bobby says nobody uses guest star I saw somebody using it the other day it wasn't guest star it was some type of like call in where you could actually it was at the top of the chat there's a collaboration I want to say it was Ash's channel actually one of our pals Ash said hi it was running that where you could like call maybe it wasn't her but somebody had that like at the top no it wasn't streamed together like it was a button that said call and join or something like that like it wasn't
6723203	6724243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6745552	6747375	Alright, for now though, we have email.
6747615	6748416	There's always email.
6748737	6752603	Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com And we have that.
6752663	6752983	You ready?
6753124	6753264	Yep.
6754912	6755772	Hello peoples!
6755852	6756733	Hey, did you hear?
6756813	6757893	They announced the thing.
6757993	6759193	You know, the thing.
6759673	6764415	The thing that we thought was a thing, which we thought they'd have announced long before now, but they've announced it.
6764975	6767996	Sure, we don't know all of the details.
6768056	6772658	We want to know most about the thing, but we do know that we'll eventually find out.
6772778	6773618	Anyway, the thing.
6773958	6774778	The thing.
6775498	6777979	I am, of course, referring to the upcoming Nine Inch Nails tour.
6778099	6778299	What?
6778379	6779220	What do you think I meant?
6779480	6780400	Stay care of entertainment.
6781482	6783984	Maybe an Addams Family character that resembles a hand.
6784585	6786186	A John Carpenter movie.
6786406	6787527	Those could have all been the thing.
6787647	6788008	I don't know.
6790770	6792792	But that's great about the Nine Inch Nails tour.
6793492	6798076	I thought they were going to announce that sooner, but I think a lot of entertainment got their...
6798885	6804528	because Beyonce was going to announce something big and then it got delayed because of the LA fires.
6804589	6806590	And I think Nine Inch Nails was in a similar situation.
6806690	6809612	So they finally, because I think it leaked or something.
6809672	6812073	So they kind of had to confirm something people already knew about.
6812133	6814315	But yeah, I don't know.
6814655	6822179	I've never really been able to picture myself going to a Nine Inch Nails show because of like, and that's only because of like the moshing and the hard dancing and all that stuff.
6822219	6827883	But like, if I could get a seat in the back where I can have my little earplugs in and go woo,
6828904	6830004	Like the old man I am.
6831205	6832566	I would love to go to a Nine Inch Nails show.
6832586	6834307	I bet it's a hell of a show, to be honest.
6835408	6836749	So, it'd be a lot of fun.
6839298	6866261	I don't know a lot of their newer songs to be honest I'm not as into them as I was when I was like in early college oh yeah oh god that was like that was high school like Downward Spiral that whole oh my god all of it I remember having like a bootleg mix of oh god what was the album that had had like a hole on it but it was like a completely different mix of it there was Pretty Hate Machine and then there was like that was it Pretty Hate Machine there was another version of it that was remixes yeah
6868155	6868435	And DJ Ranma
6889543	6892284	DarkTetsuya was saying that it was 180 from Daft Punk.
6892324	6893144	I don't really think so.
6894144	6901266	Trent Reznor has worked with, like, why can't I think of his first name, Newman, who did Cars.
6901386	6901847	Gary Newman.
6901887	6903007	Gary Newman, yeah.
6903607	6907888	Has worked with lots of just general synth-pop artists as well.
6908308	6917191	And maybe while his own personal style might be, you know, the grungier side of electronica, not to make a pun there,
6918111	6924155	but it is electronic synthesized predominantly music.
6924395	6936882	I think what Dr. Tsuyu may have meant is that that Tron Ares teaser was a very different tone than the last movie so it may be it may be late in that because the the teaser was I didn't see it so
6938492	6943176	It's a very different tone than the last movie, and I'm really not sure how to feel about it, to be honest.
6944096	6945097	I didn't even know there was a teaser.
6945117	6947979	And then again, neither of them were Wendy Carlos.
6948980	6949520	That's true.
6949900	6950341	That's true.
6951281	6953723	The teaser may have been fan cam, too.
6953803	6956285	It may have been something that they filmed off a screen at a convention.
6957285	6961168	I know it's out there, and it kind of was like, I don't know how to feel about it.
6962349	6966692	I'll see it because it's Tron, but I don't know.
6968283	6972449	If it gets us the Tron ride, I'll be glad for that.
6974051	6975212	Where would they put that in Disney?
6975232	6976033	They're out of space.
6976194	6977355	Disney California, anyway.
6977375	6978036	They're out of space.
6979718	6980920	So they build it on top of something.
6981505	6987948	I guess there's always the rumors that they're going to take out that block that Disney owns that has like the P.F.
6987968	6991830	Chang's and the Cheesecake Factory, that whole, what do they call it, Garden Center or whatever.
6992971	6995792	And then I think it's right next to a Toy Story lot.
6996593	6999874	And the rumor is they're going to take that all out and build another Disney property.
7000074	7000395	But that's...
7001240	7018660	you know, rumor and then there was talk about Mickey and Friends, they were looking at just reclaiming that space by building an even bigger parking structure somewhere else as if parking isn't shitty enough at Disneyland it's wretched yeah
7019441	7021002	but I agree with Bobby.
7021042	7023283	Make it Disney Tron and it's just a Tron park.
7023603	7024824	I love it.
7024844	7026285	Just bring Electronica back.
7026385	7027425	That was the best thing ever.
7027785	7030347	I was just talking about that with somebody the other day.
7030687	7031447	Oh, it was coworkers.
7031487	7032228	I found my tokens.
7032928	7033468	Oh, really?
7033788	7034509	Oh, I love that.
7036294	7038395	I would love to bring back Flynn's.
7038475	7043558	You know, that area that Flynn's was in was where they had the Marvel shop.
7044358	7049161	And I don't recall having seen that open last time I was at California Adventure.
7052282	7054323	I do remember seeing the building.
7054383	7055224	Was that the Marvel shop?
7055284	7058306	I thought the old Millionaire Studio was the Marvel shop now.
7058926	7062488	It was behind, it was next door to Monsters, Inc.
7062908	7064609	Okay, yeah, that's the old Millionaire Studio.
7065967	7068689	when they used to have Who Wants to Be a Millionaire at California Venture in the very beginning.
7070950	7071751	But anyway.
7072331	7072551	Anyway.
7073032	7073312	All right.
7073632	7075813	It's just called The Grid.
7076374	7077755	It's not Tron Land or Tron Rolls.
7077775	7079356	You just load up and it's The Grid.
7079576	7082498	The Muppets have been out of DCA for a minute.
7082778	7084059	Muppet Vision or whatever is gone.
7084139	7088281	And now Hollywood Studios in Florida has their official close date.
7088501	7089522	There's no more Muppet Vision.
7090243	7092484	Does anyone go on the Monsters, Inc.
7092544	7093765	ride except to rest their feet?
7095495	7101437	And ironically, I don't know if they're building the same ride, but they're building a Monsters, Inc.
7101637	7103558	section where the Muppets were at Disney.
7104118	7107960	But the Aerosmith ride is now going to be a Muppets ride.
7108020	7110901	It's Electric Mayhem.
7111201	7112381	It's an Electric Mayhem ride.
7112901	7113422	Ah, yes!
7113602	7114882	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
7114922	7116163	That sounds pretty awesome, but...
7117483	7140467	so at least they'll have a place to put all the Muppets merch and maybe Janice will finally get her due as the amazing Muppet character she is from the Electric Man this is a Janice Stan podcast far out alright anyway do we have any last minute stories, Loki?
7142408	7143848	I don't alright
7144520	7146082	Well, I don't see any callers.
7146183	7147845	I think it's time to wrap up the show.
7148366	7148786	That's alright.
7148826	7151310	We've had a good run tonight, but it's time to wrap up.
7152251	7153273	DarkSakura, are you streaming tonight?
7153293	7155236	It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.
7155516	7156458	Are you streaming tonight, DarkSakura?
7157523	7158143	Yeah, I am.
7158404	7160145	I'm feeling a certain way because I hurt.
7160245	7161406	I'm going to play some Killer tonight.
7161546	7162186	Alright, sounds good.
7162807	7164968	Well then, we'll wrap it up here and get on out.
7165008	7166669	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
7166970	7169811	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7170152	7170852	Tell a friend or two.
7170892	7171653	Help us spread the word.
7172033	7178237	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube, wherever the fuck you found this show.
7178818	7180799	Tell some friends about it by helping spread the word.
7180839	7181580	We appreciate it.
7182840	7184181	And yeah.
7185342	7188063	Let's move on and get final thoughts and get on out of here.
7188123	7189844	DarkSakura, what's your final thought for tonight?
7192265	7199509	I have never ever before pulled or hurt this muscle in my leg and it's fucking weird and it hurts and it's swelling now.
7200089	7201730	Thank goodness for ice packs.
7204151	7204411	Great.
7204892	7206092	Take care of your bodies, people.
7206112	7207253	All right.
7207993	7210694	Remember, as Dan says, it's not the years but the mileage.
7212315	7212795	That's true.
7213336	7213636	All right.
7213676	7213896	Bye.
7215860	7216981	Loki, your final thought tonight?
7219003	7220144	Yeah, that teaser looks weird.
7220885	7221165	Right?
7222446	7224248	It's a vibe.
7224989	7225549	It's different.
7226831	7230755	I don't know how to feel about it, but I'll probably see it anyway because I'm a sucker.
7231115	7232176	I'm a consumer whore.
7233657	7235559	And then my final thought is...
7237341	7241425	I'm probably going to play a lot more Diablo 4 this week because that's my favorite game right now.
7241465	7252515	When I'm stressed out, I like to mow down demons with my barbarian and his giant hammer that he just creates earthquakes everywhere on the screen and melts demons' faces.
7252915	7253836	And that's fun.
7253936	7255698	Video games are awesome.
7256498	7258060	And on that note, have a great week.
7258080	7258740	We'll see you next time.
7259061	7259221	Bye.
7261523	7263825	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7266093	7266753	See you next week.
