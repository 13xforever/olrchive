1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:20,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Hyperkin has been around since shortly after the era of all third-party accessory manufacturers being known as the little sibling's favorite controller maker, and now they're setting the music game scene on fire with the HyperStrummer, a new guitar for the Nintendo Wii?

2
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:28,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Hyperkin is known for its mini retro consoles and accessories, but apparently they're returning to their own roots, updating something that came out around the time their company was established.

3
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:29,976
[SPEAKER_01]: New year, new Wii peripheral.

4
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:34,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:37,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

6
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:56,769
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, episode number 1031 of our show for tonight, January the 12th of 2025.

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,754
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you each and every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock

10
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:05,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, how are you doing tonight?

11
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:17,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, pretty good.

12
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:22,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed the game that you are having played behind you as we are broadcasting live on Twitch tonight.

13
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,777
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a little crazy taxi going on.

14
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:29,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this does this have to do with the whole GameStop Quick Marathon and their little live band running thing that they did?

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just tracking my DoorDash order.

16
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

17
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just watching what's going on.

18
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here I thought you were making a timely reference.

19
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,152
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I am.

20
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:39,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what made me think of it.

21
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:40,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

22
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a little bit of the marathon.

23
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:51,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually saw when they hit a million during the marathon because they were actually running... Y'all know I love music games and this show exists because of music games.

24
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:58,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't planning on watching the Chunathan run, but I just happened to tune in at the right time and that's when they hit a million dollars.

25
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen this game, Loki?

26
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,649
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sega Chunathan?

27
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:01,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like...

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,070
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I describe it?

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's got like a touchpad, so it looks like maybe like a keyboard, but not like an actual like piano keyboard.

30
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:18,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's got like a little touchpad, but then there's, it actually does like the, and I don't even want to call it para para thing, but it does like where you lift up your hand and there's actually sensors that tell when you lift your hand up.

31
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:22,818
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're making these motions where you're like doing this and crosses and all this stuff.

32
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:28,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously during a big marathon like that, it's just all the insane shit in that game.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,422
[SPEAKER_05]: hitting it once in that, which, you know, you can't read those charts.

34
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:38,825
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've played, a friend of mine actually has a machine in his house.

35
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've played the smaller, easier levels of that game, but it's fun.

36
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:46,202
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

37
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:06,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We're celebrating our affiliate anniversary here at the Voice Geeks Network.

38
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:12,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever that means on Twitch, they let you have party hats in your chat on your Twitch affiliate anniversary.

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:17,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, the channel started in December of 2018.

40
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,075
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

41
00:03:40,157 --> 00:03:49,743
[SPEAKER_05]: So many followers, which thanks to having a presence on Shoutcast and other networks before that, it was pretty easy to hit that relatively fast.

42
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:54,246
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had to kind of do a few extra streams like during the week to hit the minimum.

43
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks to all your support, we were able to hit affiliate pretty quick.

44
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:01,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we're celebrating, I guess, as an affiliate, that would be what?

45
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven years?

46
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:03,612
[SPEAKER_05]: No, six years?

47
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:05,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Six years tonight.

48
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:06,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is math?

49
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:16,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but the reason why I bring all this up is because, you know, when we first made the pivot to video, which is a big learning experience for us because, you know, we were radio for so long.

50
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:23,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So we weren't used to things like, you know, looking at the camera or realizing people could see what we were just like completely multitasking and doing other stuff.

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,421
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we had to get used to some of that type of thing.

52
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:28,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also just the environment of the studio in the house.

53
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:28,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the

54
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:29,922
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

55
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,666
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:15,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Smush, we actually rescued at three or four years old.

57
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,813
[SPEAKER_05]: He was fending for himself in an apartment complex, and that's one of the great questions of my life will always be, what happened to Smush before we found him?

58
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:25,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can't believe somebody would let this cat go.

59
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, he had some... I mean, maybe if he was being bred for shows, as a lot of exotics are, he came out a little...

60
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Incorrect, you know, in the genetics department.

61
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what made him adorable.

62
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:40,960
[SPEAKER_05]: We loved him.

63
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, so he was abandoned.

64
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was about a month after we had let our cat Sanrio go when she was about 17.

65
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:55,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of you that have been listening a long, long time might remember hearing of Sanrio, our other cat.

66
00:05:56,366 --> 00:06:00,248
[SPEAKER_05]: She was 17 and we had to let her go.

67
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was probably about a month.

68
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a friend of mine said,

69
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

70
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:28,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was actually being encouraged at some point to create a Reddit for Mr. Smoosh, but I was like, I don't know what, why would I create a Reddit for my cat?

71
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it never really clicked for me.

72
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, I'll make an Instagram, which probably isn't what they wanted.

73
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:37,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it allowed them to keep tabs on Mr. Smoosh and all that good stuff.

74
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:46,699
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we're very thankful being able to, you know, have the cat for as long as we did, which, you know, he was estimated to be about three, four years when we got him.

75
00:06:47,219 --> 00:07:14,369
[SPEAKER_05]: and then um we had him for seven years and you know he would have been about 10 or 11 and those kidney failure I talked about from last April it just started to get really bad and we noticed especially in the past couple weeks like since the holidays just he was losing a lot of weight he'd already was pretty skinny um he wasn't really eating as much he was just you know and you know how it goes so we took him into the vet and the vet did the labs and said look um it's time

76
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:30,615
[SPEAKER_05]: and so we had to do that and obviously it was very very hard but he was able to go in Alan's lap I was right there looking at him when everything happened and that is that so obviously it's you know it's sad thank you and I see I see a lot of love in the chat

77
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:37,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we had a long warning for my cat pixel as well because it didn't make the day or week later any easier.

78
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:38,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very that.

79
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:46,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, I was actually kind of thinking of you and your situation because it was that similar thing where it was kind of like we knew we had one more night.

80
00:07:46,579 --> 00:08:08,919
[SPEAKER_05]: and that was probably going to be it so you know we were able to like mentally prepare so it it's had a toll on us don't get me wrong I'm holding it together tonight but um it was a lot easier when it wasn't as sudden you know we've had time to sort of mentally prepare that every day really was a gift and thank you as well for all the kind words and chat I really appreciate it yeah we tried to give him the best life we could but he you have to remember this that was our pandemic cat

81
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,321
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,080
[SPEAKER_05]: and we don't know.

83
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's also not every cat will do it.

84
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan seems to think that Cheddar could probably smell that things were off with Mr. Smush and maybe has kind of figured it out.

85
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:49,672
[SPEAKER_05]: We also kind of know that Cheddar has always been more of an anxious and shy cat and it's really funny.

86
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:53,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all didn't really get to see this but Mr. Smush was the one that was a bully.

87
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,397
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:09:19,352 --> 00:09:21,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing until that part, at least.

89
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:29,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have plenty of months to really dedicate to taking care of a new cat or whatever we decide to do.

90
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:29,537
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know.

91
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:33,599
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about a lot of options, but obviously it's still hard to think about

92
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,001
[SPEAKER_05]: A new cat.

93
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:38,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of you pet owners have been there.

94
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:44,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to replace your pet because your pets can't be replaced, but you want to move on in your heart because there's space in your heart.

95
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:49,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all of those emotions we're going through right now and we'll get there, but it'll be a little closer to the end of the month.

96
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:50,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, thank you all for...

97
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:56,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Listening to that, I know that's not the most exciting topic in the world, but I wanted to get that off my chest.

98
00:09:57,286 --> 00:10:08,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And just so all of you are aware, because you all have sent so much love to our cats over the years, not just here on Orange Launch Radio, but in the personal streams that I've done and Alan has done over the years.

99
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've watched them, you probably saw the cat at some point.

100
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:15,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So just sending all the love right back at y'all.

101
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

102
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.

103
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:19,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games, of course.

104
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:20,845
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio.

105
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:23,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

106
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, I didn't address DarkSakura's absence, did I?

107
00:10:25,971 --> 00:10:28,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I went right into Mr. Smush.

108
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:29,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to talk about DarkSakura.

109
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:32,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's fine, except DarkSakura's just sick tonight.

110
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,664
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't able to make tonight's show, so they're taking the night off to rest up and feel better.

111
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:12,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything, because they see that as an opportunity to make more money and have more potential customers that you can approach.

113
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox doesn't necessarily have to be just the Xbox platform.

114
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:20,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now, there are some... This is a box.

115
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,677
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Xbox.

116
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:25,119
[SPEAKER_05]: This is... I'm referring to the marketing campaign.

117
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole new thing they're trying to do.

118
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:30,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is... It's weird, but I guess it gets the message across.

119
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:31,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the average buyer...

120
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:36,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

121
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,709
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, that's another.

122
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:38,010
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

123
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And considering.

124
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:43,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's I don't think they understand nor care at this point.

125
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:51,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would say the best option for some of that stuff would be like, hey, this is like a Netflix and Netflix can be on everything, you know, like that.

126
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,142
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kind of the way they approach their cloud streaming, I think.

127
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:54,282
[SPEAKER_03]: But.

128
00:11:54,862 --> 00:12:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: along with that though apparently according to a gaming insider the Halo the Master Chief collection is slated to come to the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 this year that they are already planning on porting that over which that makes sense it's an older game at this point you know so that game's

129
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a new game, but it is definitely like an Xbox catalog title.

130
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:28,956
[SPEAKER_05]: That would still be the equivalent of Nintendo allowing Zelda Breath of the Wild on PlayStation, which was Snowball's chance in hell, right?

131
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's kind of the equivalent.

132
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:36,284
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of their biggest catalog titles, even if it's what, like eight years old at this point, you know?

133
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:59,114
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah he says uh so games i have heard that will be released multi-platform in 2025 and beyond uh of course obviously it's going to include flight simulator will come to playstation 5 and switch 2 and then they mentioned the halo master that game needs a second chance as well it botched its original launch that game needs a second chance so good on them i guess

134
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:10,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then it says Microsoft will be a big supporter of Nintendo's new system in its first year with other ports as well.

135
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:11,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That isn't surprising.

136
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Ori coming out on that.

137
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:20,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Sea of Thieves, that was on my predictions list for last year when we thought we'd get the Switch 2 last year.

138
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Sea of Thieves seems like a must for the Switch.

139
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be such a good title.

140
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they already said, yeah, they're bringing that.

141
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, there you go.

142
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:39,059
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, so it's... Yeah, not too much of a surprise that they'll be... Yeah, so Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentament, and Grounded were the four.

143
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:40,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's great.

144
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:40,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

145
00:13:41,910 --> 00:14:07,036
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course along with that Microsoft is looking to maybe develop a handheld system and right now it says they are working or you know back in November Phil Spencer had said they are working on a gaming handheld device but it's years out they said I don't know why it's years out when you have the Steam Deck I mean there's lots of iterations coming with that type of thing um

146
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd be curious what it is they're doing that necessitates a few years of incubation.

147
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: That sort of kind of implies that there's some type of tech in there that's not out today or something.

148
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

149
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:23,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know to what extent you do with that, but we'll see when we see.

150
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Jason Ronald, who has spoken to The Verge, he is the VP of Next Generation, is after a roundtable called The Future of Gaming Handhelds, where he suggested that Microsoft could create less of a handheld Xbox but more of a handheld PC offering with an Xbox-like experience.

151
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:53,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, though, if you're going to spend years to do what the Steam Deck has already done and probably better...

152
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:55,836
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the Windows phone all over again.

153
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, Microsoft.

154
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:01,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta step it up if you're gonna be trying to compete in that space.

155
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:04,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, honestly, I don't think you really should.

156
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably you should just get in bed with Steam and Asus or whomever are putting out these handhelds and say, hey, can you put our streaming platform as one of your install apps on there?

157
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-installed in there so you have access to it or something and throw in like

158
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:50,417
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 months of the service or something like that I think that would be a better value proposition than developing your own handheld which will probably get outdated pretty quick I'm not sure nowadays originally the Surface tablets are pretty nice and I think the Surface laptops are somewhat competitive but I don't know what they are in the current landscape of handheld and tablet devices if there are any

159
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:53,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know It'd be interesting to see what comes of that

160
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:13,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm very curious to see where Microsoft's kind of direction takes them this year, too.

161
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:18,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of, you know, freeing themselves from just like, you know, a big console manufacturer being that and these other things, too.

162
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:19,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be very interesting.

163
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

164
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:28,390
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100Matt says, I do think there is a more than 0% chance of a Game Pass app on Switch 2.

165
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it, but it's not zero.

166
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you that it's non-zero.

167
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:35,332
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not impossible, but...

168
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,934
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be the Nintendo Online type thing.

169
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the big problem with that.

170
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:42,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is the complication.

171
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about where Game Pass is really successful right now because a lot of games keep disappearing from the app.

172
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:53,027
[SPEAKER_05]: But Game Pass gets really successful with a lot of indie games and smaller games.

173
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:57,351
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is many of those games are also for sale on the Switch.

174
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So to have a Game Pass app where you'll be able to play those games by paying Microsoft...

175
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:07,458
[SPEAKER_05]: to play those games for free kind of actively takes money out of Nintendo's pocket.

176
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there could be some type of licensing agreement.

177
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because maybe Microsoft is willing to pay Nintendo a pretty penny because it would attract more Game Pass subscribers.

178
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:20,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe, you know, maybe Microsoft's open to paying a lot of money to make that happen.

179
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:23,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we say it's non-zero, right?

180
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:31,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the other could be that it's just your Game Pass selections on Switch would be limited, which isn't completely...

181
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,173
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

182
00:17:49,898 --> 00:18:16,977
[SPEAKER_05]: could be very good on Nintendo so like maybe they're selling cloud access only but they don't do local installs of the games so if you want to play the Nintendo games when you're not attached to a wi-fi when you're on the train on a plane on a bus whatever uh you can you can you'll have to download the game from Nintendo's eShop to play the game outside of the cloud I think that could be that could sort of be like maybe that little medium a cloud player on the Switch

183
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:46,140
[SPEAKER_05]: but we'll see I mean again this is a lot of admittedly a lot of fan wank and speculation we don't have a lot to go off of but we do see certainly Microsoft probably wants to do it I think we all can agree Microsoft wants to do it now the question is is Nintendo gonna what does Nintendo get out of this and if it's that kind of system where it's the cloud only and maybe Nintendo generates some sales or Microsoft pays them a fuck ton of money then Nintendo gets something out of it it'll be interesting

184
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a fun year with all these announcements.

185
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:54,370
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a question of when do we start getting announcements?

186
00:18:55,771 --> 00:19:02,236
[SPEAKER_05]: The Switch 2 and all of that, there was a part of me that expected we might hear about it this last week.

187
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say if we don't hear about it next week, then that console's not out till the holiday.

188
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:12,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Like September type of thing.

189
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Nintendo could always surprise me.

190
00:19:14,183 --> 00:19:16,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I might end up eating these words later on.

191
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:17,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo runs on their own rules.

192
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:23,446
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just, I'm a little bit surprised Nintendo would not want to have it out for the fiscal year.

193
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:27,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized their commitment was the announcement will be in the fiscal year.

194
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm just a little surprised similar to the original Switch you wouldn't put it out in March like March 1st, March 3rd, whatever to get that launch sales on your books for the fiscal year I'm a little surprised Nintendo wouldn't do that but they must truly feel they are not ready with the games or something

195
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I still think that they're going to do it because the Switch has slowed down.

196
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:59,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the sales on that have slowed down pretty massively.

197
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine that they would just let it sit for another, even another six months beyond where we're like,

198
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Picturing it to be like, what else would be coming out?

199
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:12,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just can't imagine much of anything.

200
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:13,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

201
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:14,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We know.

202
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is, we know Prime 4 is coming.

203
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:19,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend C3 is coming.

204
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it coming, though, for the Switch?

205
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:24,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Because those pre-orders got canceled.

206
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:25,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So tech.

207
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:26,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't hear about that part.

208
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was just an Amazon thing.

209
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:29,404
[SPEAKER_05]: A year's old.

210
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,204
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to that.

211
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:30,785
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

212
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:35,053
[SPEAKER_05]: They really only announced those titles for Switch.

213
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:41,598
[SPEAKER_05]: We are all assuming, we're making a jump because we know the games will be backwards compatible on Switch 2.

214
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:53,587
[SPEAKER_05]: We are assuming they will play better, play differently, have something like the Advanced Dungeon in Zelda Oracle Seasons, Oracle Ages, that type of... We are assuming there is... But...

215
00:20:54,147 --> 00:20:55,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, we don't know.

216
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And all we know is that Pokemon Legends ZA is Switch.

217
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:01,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Metroid Prime 4 is Switch.

218
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do have games.

219
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:10,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But I, Loki, I too would be very surprised if they try to ride the current Switch wave all the way to holiday.

220
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a long wave.

221
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,623
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too long, I think.

222
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:15,265
[SPEAKER_05]: For what?

223
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:15,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

224
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:21,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody in the history of ever has said, oh, the system was delayed too much.

225
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:22,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to buy it.

226
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:24,195
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, right.

227
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:28,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe if I just can't imagine, though, that we're just going to make the software to justify it.

228
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:29,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

229
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:29,878
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see.

230
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:35,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine that we see all these peripherals and things that are coming out.

231
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,245
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're getting ready for it now.

232
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:42,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You would think that would be something that they wouldn't get that ready this early.

233
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:54,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The intensification of the leaks and everything that happened at CES and all that stuff, the intensification of all that is why I'm saying, okay, I would legit be surprised if it's not announced next week.

234
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:17,661
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's just all the smoke the smoke is smoking and so now it's time to show the fire right I just to have us wait all the way until March at this point for a I don't fucking know summer release or something um that that just would really surprise me with all of the intense leaks and you know stuff about third party stuff that's out there now

235
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:18,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

236
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:19,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

237
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:47,113
[SPEAKER_05]: The Switch also reinvented the rules completely, so who's to say Nintendo can't invent them again?

238
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:50,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Switch announcement was two weeks after the holidays.

239
00:22:52,414 --> 00:23:00,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, just because it is set for maybe the 17th doesn't mean that it can't change.

240
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:06,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they may have heard that data at some point, but who knows?

241
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:07,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

242
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,480
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wait and see.

243
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:11,442
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll announce it when they're going to announce it.

244
00:23:11,462 --> 00:23:14,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be like, oh, wow, that's exactly what we saw.

245
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:16,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll happen when it happens, but...

246
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: The chance of maybe a midweek VOG Network special covering a sudden press announcement is also non-zero, so stay tuned, folks.

247
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:45,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it does get announced this week, we obviously will spend a lot of time on next week's OLR talking about it, but I can't see where Bobby, myself, and whoever's available the day it's announced hop on a special and hammer it out.

248
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:46,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean...

249
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to go too dark here.

250
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

251
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of have to announce it before all hell breaks loose.

252
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:52,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

253
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking the same thing.

254
00:23:54,892 --> 00:24:01,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best to capture that now before all the insane shit just about to happen.

255
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,064
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to be in the news, you probably should get it out there before January 20th.

256
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:07,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying, yeah.

257
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably safe.

258
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,651
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the other big thing?

259
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else?

260
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's make believe.

261
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, bro.

262
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:14,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Guy is right.

263
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's January 17th.

264
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:22,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, I also agree a Friday announcement makes no sense.

265
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:30,359
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is that, it's January 17th in Japan, but it's January 16th here.

266
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go that far to say it.

267
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,721
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, trust me, bro, right?

268
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think the other headline they're going to have to worry about is TikTok's imminent

269
00:24:41,283 --> 00:25:07,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Judgment coming in on if it gets banned for sure or not Because that probably won't come in until later in the week And then everybody's going to know Either TikTok is done or TikTok is going to be around I think if it survives this ban, it's going to be around forever at this point So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens on that front Boy, that's a whole other thing That's a whole other rabbit hole we could go down someday Because all the bullshit that's going on at Meta this week There's a lot of people that are like

270
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The fuck are we supposed to do when TikTok goes?

271
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:10,716
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to Instagram reels?

272
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the fuck not, after what Zuckerberg's been pulling this week.

273
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, everybody, it's Mask Off Mondays.

274
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's starting on January 20th.

275
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:25,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Take those masks off and do all the hate crimes.

276
00:25:25,788 --> 00:25:28,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, it's disgusting.

277
00:25:28,711 --> 00:25:30,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And I deleted the Facebook app off my phone.

278
00:25:31,034 --> 00:25:32,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't delete Facebook.

279
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:33,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this.

280
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a real reality check on how much we are tied to social media apps in certain ways because you may use Facebook as your third-party login for certain things.

281
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:45,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that in mind.

282
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:48,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Be mindful of that if you're going to delete your Facebook.

283
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,492
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to know which apps – and you can see that, I think, through your connected apps on Facebook.

284
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Be very mindful if you're going to throw Facebook away, which I wouldn't blame anyone for doing.

285
00:25:56,754 --> 00:25:57,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a little harder.

286
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for me, again, so much event – I know what I do here on OLR.

287
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:05,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm able to announce that stuff on Blue Sky and stuff and do fairly well.

288
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:08,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But like the live event hosting I do, I think a lot of you know I host –

289
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't just throw it away and lose all that promotion because Zuckerberg is a bitch.

290
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,771
[SPEAKER_05]: But does it have me thinking about, well, what can I do?

291
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I delete the app off my phone?

292
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:37,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can do that and just stick to using the web.

293
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:42,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think a lot of us are thinking like fucking LiveJournal came and went.

294
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:43,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Friendster came and went.

295
00:26:43,814 --> 00:26:48,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I realize all of these things may exist in some shell of its former self, but you all know what I mean.

296
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So LiveJournal came and went.

297
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Friendster came and went.

298
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:52,697
[SPEAKER_05]: MySpace came and went.

299
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,618
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these websites came and went.

300
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

301
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,321
[SPEAKER_05]: won't Facebook die?

302
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:04,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the answer has to do with because they buy up their competitions, exactly what's happening in the VR space.

303
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,238
[SPEAKER_05]: They buy up their competition, take it over, and then there's no competition or whatever.

304
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:12,962
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, what I hope happens...

305
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:15,549
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

306
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:40,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a little extra space tonight.

307
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:42,178
[SPEAKER_05]: The news is a little bit light.

308
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only two of us.

309
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:48,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So I read this article online that was called The Enshitification of Blue Sky That's Incoming.

310
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:53,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And I felt that this article completely missed how Blue Sky was fucking built.

311
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:57,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was talking about, at some point, Blue Sky is going to have to make money.

312
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means they're going to have to sell ads.

313
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:02,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything's going to go to shit, just like it does on every other platform.

314
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:06,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But to me, that article missed a very key part of Blue Sky.

315
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,872
[SPEAKER_05]: BlueSky was built and founded to get around that.

316
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:21,899
[SPEAKER_05]: BlueSky is built on something else called the At Protocol, which in theory is a little bit more for what Mastodon is kind of built on, is the Mastodon Protocol and that whole thing.

317
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way that BlueSky... BlueSky and Mastodon are actually not that unalike.

318
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the place that BlueSky succeeded is that BlueSky coming out the gate...

319
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:35,328
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of set their thing as the default for the app protocol.

320
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:38,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, everybody, you know, has their feeds on that.

321
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:49,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it didn't feel like Mastodon where you had to explain what is an instance and all this stuff, you know, and eventually Mastodon finally kind of made that different where in their own app, you default to Mastodon social.

322
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they kind of did that too late.

323
00:28:52,322 --> 00:28:54,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Sky already had the narrative at that point.

324
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:54,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

325
00:28:54,764 --> 00:28:57,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I didn't understand the whole Mastodon thing when I tried to figure it out.

326
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,812
[SPEAKER_05]: A TikTok competitor on that app protocol.

327
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's a lot easier said than done.

328
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:28,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I sit here and go, voila, you make TikTok on app protocol.

329
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:30,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, bitch, that's going to take years of development.

330
00:29:30,678 --> 00:29:32,139
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not like even Blue Sky.

331
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:36,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody knows Blue Sky wasn't really ready for primetime.

332
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:40,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that it became a thing of necessity for very many people.

333
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:45,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody knows the problem Blue Sky has right now, such as they don't have the images and the DMs.

334
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,850
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really have private accounts because

335
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: App Protocol wasn't built to be that.

336
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:54,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to understand why was App Protocol spun off from Twitter?

337
00:29:55,151 --> 00:30:01,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Twitter was getting these government notices and the government takedowns and they were supposed to be hiding things from the government.

338
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:11,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole reason why Jack funded this App Protocol and Blue Sky thing in the first place was that they wanted a social media system that truly lived in the cloud so that nobody could ever shut it down.

339
00:30:12,918 --> 00:30:13,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the whole thing.

340
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:21,724
[SPEAKER_05]: When they talk about, oh, Blue Sky is going to go to shit because it's going to have ads and all of this stuff, the main Blue Sky client might.

341
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:22,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But guess what?

342
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: App Protocol was built to be portable.

343
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: You would be able to move your account from one place to another just like that.

344
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of your posts, all of your identity and all of that would move with you because Blue Sky doesn't own it.

345
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:35,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the App Protocol in the cloud.

346
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:37,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my understanding of it.

347
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure some of you that are more into following this than I am will –

348
00:30:42,518 --> 00:30:54,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct me on a few things, but I think generally my point is Blue Sky is set up in a different way because it's set up to be Elon Musk proof, essentially.

349
00:30:54,524 --> 00:31:00,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody can come in and buy, well, you could buy Blue Sky, but you can't buy App Protocol.

350
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:01,367
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference.

351
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:10,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a shitlord came in and bought Blue Sky and we all decided we're over it, we'd pack up and move to another App Protocol instance.

352
00:31:12,068 --> 00:31:13,889
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what makes Blue Sky at its core different.

353
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And that could also go for, you know, I'm sorry, very long-winded, but how to get around this TikTok ban.

354
00:31:19,592 --> 00:31:24,715
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was a TikTok or an Instagram competitor that was built on app protocol, then same thing.

355
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:30,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You would be able to have those posts and move them with you and it would live somewhere else and all of that.

356
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:30,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's...

357
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what develops in that whole thing.

358
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:36,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

359
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at chat here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

360
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:46,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Class says, Blue Sky right now seems to have a bot problem because you get followed by a lot of these bot accounts.

361
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,607
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a perfect example of the problem they're having right now where they're growing and maybe they weren't ready for primetime, but they kind of had to be.

362
00:31:55,334 --> 00:32:11,108
[SPEAKER_05]: and you see if you follow one of the developers there's actually custom feeds again the best part of Blue Sky there is a Blue Sky team custom feed I'm actually not sure if Paul Frazzi is on there but he's like the chief technical officer and if you actually look at his account which I think is pfrazzi.com somebody in chat will post it

363
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:14,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But he actually posts updates.

364
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,851
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very transparent with that type of thing.

365
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's got a sense of humor.

366
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:20,292
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, I think, a millennial that has that kind of sense of humor.

367
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:25,474
[SPEAKER_05]: He was making updates like, I think we've won the battle against the bots, but we haven't won the war just yet.

368
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:26,515
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still working on it.

369
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're trying.

370
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But Blue Sky is literally a team of 20 people.

371
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:56,517
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah and at least with the bots so you can just block them and that's it it's annoying but it's not ultimately harming you you know no and usually when I see new followers like I will go and look at their profile and see oh yeah this one look it it's made to look like somebody that's you know has a GoFundMe and they're begging for nope bye you know sorry you know it's just

372
00:32:57,758 --> 00:33:00,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what Blue Sky did do as a short-term fix.

373
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If you get annoyed by those follower notifications and all that stuff, you may not know it, but in your notifications tab on Blue Sky, there is a second tab now that only shows you replies.

374
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So it filters out all the follow notices.

375
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:17,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are getting annoyed by the PornBot follow notices, just default to your replies tab.

376
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:20,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, unfortunately, you won't see real people that follow you, so that is kind of a...

377
00:33:21,741 --> 00:33:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Slippery Slope but it might at least maybe until they win the battle against the bots then maybe hopefully that'll all you know, filter out but we'll see we'll see so

378
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:35,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway, sorry for the tangent, but let's be real.

379
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:39,628
[SPEAKER_05]: You might say, Rob, you spent 15 minutes talking about something that has nothing to do with video games.

380
00:33:40,408 --> 00:33:42,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is video game culture.

381
00:33:42,369 --> 00:33:44,050
[SPEAKER_05]: This is video game announcements.

382
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,392
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how news is going to spread about the Switch 2 and future platforms.

383
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Social media is fucking important on how games live or die.

384
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,275
[SPEAKER_05]: How do games go viral?

385
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: How does a Minecraft get the traction that it does?

386
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,042
[SPEAKER_05]: How does a Five Nights at Freddy's?

387
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:03,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the new one that's going viral, at least on my TikTok feed?

388
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck, I can't remember the name of it.

389
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:07,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat hopefully knows the name.

390
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:08,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm sorry to always rely on chat.

391
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:09,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Garden of Banban?

392
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:17,839
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's the one, okay, it's the, it's a survival horror game, but you play a child and it's the parents that are mad at you.

393
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,740
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pissed at you because you got an F in something.

394
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:26,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, they, they, no, yeah, they're like, you're hiding in the closet and the parents like, I told you to clean your room.

395
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:29,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's actually like, it can be super triggering for some people, I'm sure.

396
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:34,131
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, that's, I kind of think what makes the game sort of brilliant.

397
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:53,739
[SPEAKER_05]: uh kind of damn it i wish i knew the name of the game i thought it was school boy something uh survival horror game parents what was the name of this disturbing horrible game where you have again yes this is it school boy sorry i'm bringing up a youtube uh school boy run away that's the game

398
00:34:55,031 --> 00:35:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: that game looks fucking psycho so I that that's and that's at least on my TikTok maybe it's because I've watched one too many videos on it right now because there's like an ending that is can I can I talk about the ending I'm gonna because I've seen on TikTok if you don't want to hear about the ending to this game then fast forward a minute

399
00:35:15,353 --> 00:35:39,256
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a sequence in the basement you get teleported so when you get far enough from the house and you get teleported you get teleported randomly to this basement in this home and then you see as you're walking around you're like why am I here randomly and you see this giant squid monster and as soon as the squid monster sees you you hear the boy cry out mommy and it's like really disturbing and then the squid monster chases you and kills you

400
00:35:40,587 --> 00:36:01,894
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's this whole very like it was Cthulhu all along but it's this whole fucked up thing where it was like even though he was running away from her he called out her name in the end and it's like one of those like oh my god this game is like fucked beyond belief so anyway that's just that game like totally caught my attention I was like ooh this is wild so yeah

401
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:18,304
[SPEAKER_05]: but yeah it's things like that that you know again I would not know of that game if it wasn't for TikTok and social media and that whole type of thing so Bobby Blackwolf says it didn't go viral enough because you don't remember the game I remember the game I just don't remember the name and that's my that's an age problem

402
00:36:22,492 --> 00:36:27,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into a segment we do pretty regularly here on the show called How Was Your Gaming Week?

403
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:31,358
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

404
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:33,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'm going to start off with you.

405
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:40,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this week has been rebuilding, basically building the whole water ride on our survival server.

406
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:49,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a lot of times what I'll do with stuff is I design it on our creative server because it allows me to iterate much faster over the course of however long.

407
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:53,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, we recreate it in survival after I've gathered all the blocks.

408
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a half a million block build.

409
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:18,563
[SPEAKER_03]: um and I'm still adding details to it but like I really hustled to get that all done because once again in the season already um pretty much to the end of this month is when I have to have everything done in the build which it's getting there it's it's almost there I'm just adding more details I'm probably going to finish up um this last section of the park that

410
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,004
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

411
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:40,086
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

412
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:15,250
[SPEAKER_03]: had commissioned music from a guy on Fiverr for the ride, but it just doesn't fit at all.

413
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:24,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that even though he said English fluent, he just wasn't quite 100% English fluent and just was confused by what I wanted.

414
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:28,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good country song, or two country songs, but it's not what I asked for.

415
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:32,043
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll reuse those later on.

416
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:32,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I did find some...

417
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:39,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, in the YouTube Music Library, some banjo music that works perfectly for what I wanted to do.

418
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:41,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would have cost me nothing.

419
00:38:41,793 --> 00:38:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm hoping to get this all done, and hopefully get... I mean, I'm trying to get... I originally was going to plan on doing two more episodes, but it's probably just going to get lumped in the one.

420
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,960
[SPEAKER_03]: One and done, and that's it.

421
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,602
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not even sure if I'm going to do a story finale.

422
00:38:56,642 --> 00:38:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of touched story a little bit this season, but...

423
00:39:00,814 --> 00:39:12,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I'm too busy to do it right now, and if I spent the time I did last season on the finale, I mean, that took a month alone just to do that, and I don't want to do that again.

424
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to put myself through that stress.

425
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:14,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

426
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:16,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Not worth it.

427
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:30,157
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the upside, though, this creator, Minecraft creator, goes by NewCurry, put out a top SMP worlds, or top worlds of 2024 list, and our server was number one.

428
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:31,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was nice.

429
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a top list.

430
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:41,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a huge sizable creator, like 15,000 subs or whatever, but still nice to be shouted out again.

431
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:42,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

432
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:42,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you.

433
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:44,739
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Mike.

434
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and now Bolaltro, of course.

435
00:39:46,741 --> 00:39:47,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course.

436
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was a little slower because of everything I talked about at the beginning of the show.

437
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:55,085
[SPEAKER_05]: You can understand games were not at the front of my mind, but I was able to play a little bit.

438
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:59,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I hung out with a friend last night, and we were playing with Steam Decks in the same room.

439
00:39:59,627 --> 00:40:04,170
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, oh, we can play like a multiplayer game on our Steam Decks, and we played Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

440
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: We were trying to look at what games do we both own that we could play.

441
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:10,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were actually playing that game, which, God...

442
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to remind you, in case you forgot, which I don't think you maybe did, but just in case you forgot, the soundtrack to that game is so fucking good.

443
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:27,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Go do yourself a favor and go listen to the Anamanaguchi music for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, because it's so, so good, and probably the best part of that game, because

444
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:33,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That game kind of annoys me how the NPCs will kind of hang on the very side of the screen.

445
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,655
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of do too much of that thing from the arcade.

446
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:37,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun.

447
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:39,137
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun to play in the same room.

448
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:40,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was playing a few other Steam Deck games.

449
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:43,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Pac-Man Championship Edition and things like that.

450
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also played a little bit of World of Warcraft.

451
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually kind of finding my vibe in that game again.

452
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:54,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I still love Final Fantasy XIV, but there's really nothing for me in that game right now.

453
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really waiting for...

454
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,433
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

455
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:15,127
[SPEAKER_05]: The War Within expansion is pretty good.

456
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:16,228
[SPEAKER_05]: The game's in a decent place.

457
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:20,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the whole delve thing where you can do these dungeon-type experiences basically by yourself.

458
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they did a good job with it.

459
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:29,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's many different ways to gear up and feel like you're getting some of the best gear in the game without necessarily being an endgame raider.

460
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can get it really fast doing that and you get really, really good stuff, but you still feel progression doing other stuff too, which is pretty cool.

461
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really it.

462
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I can really think of anything else during my gaming week, so...

463
00:41:42,302 --> 00:42:00,864
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately I still need to beat the Guardian Legend I'd hope to play that I was going to do it Tuesday night but everything else started happening so it is what it is I'll hopefully get to that this week and finishing the Guardian Legend and get on some other retro games too so all right let's get into some more gaming news Loki is gonna kick us off

464
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:06,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we kind of alluded to it earlier when we were talking about the Switch 2 at CES.

465
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:09,199
[SPEAKER_03]: The course had more Switch 2 leaks, I guess.

466
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:16,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Those, of course, one of the major ones was from, I guess, Genki.

467
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:26,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a third-party peripheral company who had some 3D models of a Switch system and had, you know...

468
00:42:27,284 --> 00:42:33,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had a 3D video that were kind of showing how the Joy-Cons interacted with the console and whatnot.

469
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:45,497
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and along with that, not only were there leaks from that, but there's also leaks from GameStop as well, because guess what?

470
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:55,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The Switch 2 SKU, it's in their system now, in their POS, so obviously it's coming.

471
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:58,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have to see.

472
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:00,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

473
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:01,915
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't actually for the system.

474
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:04,998
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for micro SD cards that are branded for Switch 2.

475
00:43:05,158 --> 00:43:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something that's coming as well as more peripheral things.

476
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all that smoke I was referring to earlier.

477
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just intensifying too much for there not to be a relatively imminent announcement.

478
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:17,067
[SPEAKER_05]: But again...

479
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:44,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not willing to bet money on it because nothing Nintendo does in the delay department and all that surprises me anymore and ultimately at the end of the day we're all still going to buy one if we can afford it now Nintendo has come out to comment on this though but what they commented was very vague in the sense that the gaming hardware that Genki is claiming to be the Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by Nintendo and

480
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:52,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but they have to make their accessories by specs.

481
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,695
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to just make accessories for something that does not exist.

482
00:43:56,755 --> 00:44:02,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm going to make an accessory for this fictional Atari console that's never going to be out.

483
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:03,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know...

484
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:09,289
[SPEAKER_05]: The rabble rabble of this thing, especially being at a trade show, and that's the key difference.

485
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: When people are doing these Nintendo rumors and shit on X and other social media, Nintendo just can go, well, the internet is internetting and it's the internet's – it's very easy to log on and lie, right?

486
00:44:22,219 --> 00:44:22,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

487
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:34,343
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's different when you are paying for a booth at the largest electronic trade show, I think, in the world, maybe in the country at least, and you're actively advertising these peripherals.

488
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:38,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Nintendo is sort of back to a quarter to comment in a different way.

489
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:38,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

490
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, someone gave them the specs.

491
00:44:40,404 --> 00:44:45,346
[SPEAKER_03]: They aren't just, like, creating these peripherals out of thin air because they, like, think this is what it might look like.

492
00:44:46,505 --> 00:45:05,636
[SPEAKER_03]: you work with these companies and like I get it that you can't just say oh yes it's not a real switch that they had right it was a 3D mock-up that basically is the same size and shape it's just you have to have something to show how the peripherals go together they are taking a really big gamble

493
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:30,577
[SPEAKER_05]: that their leak is correct so they can be first and by being at this trade show and getting in front of you know stores and things like that they want to be the peripherals that are on the shelves before everybody else rolls back their official announcements and since I am assuming this company is not under any sort of NDA with Nintendo because if they were holy shit that would be a problem that they don't have to wait that this whole thing is hedging their bets that this intel is right

494
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:33,778
[SPEAKER_05]: so they can be first and get the shelf space commitment.

495
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:34,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what it is.

496
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a lot of talk about, oh, they just want to get their name out there, which is also working, let's be real.

497
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the shelf space.

498
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:46,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge bet that their intel is good.

499
00:45:47,383 --> 00:45:48,384
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be right.

500
00:45:48,404 --> 00:45:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

501
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:53,425
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, moving on.

502
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:58,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you all are excited about Switch 2, but we don't have a lot more to say until they officially unveil it.

503
00:45:58,648 --> 00:46:02,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the Xbox Rewards Program.

504
00:46:03,272 --> 00:46:04,393
[SPEAKER_05]: You're grinning over there, Loki.

505
00:46:05,914 --> 00:46:07,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nothing.

506
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:18,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep getting bugged by Xbox and the Rewards Program because every time I play Minecraft, apparently it's been accruing points for me on my account.

507
00:46:18,563 --> 00:46:18,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

508
00:46:19,713 --> 00:46:34,490
[SPEAKER_05]: and I haven't looked at it for years so I've got like a ton of stuff on there I guess for like a month of ultimate game passes and you can add it to your current subscriptions you just don't pay for a game pass for a month yeah spend those points don't let them go to waste

509
00:46:35,231 --> 00:46:38,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so okay, well, if you have points or what have you.

510
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:49,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So Microsoft made changes that weren't so popular to its rewards program, I want to say the middle of last year, but now we're getting kind of some revamps that I think are going to help some people out.

511
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:56,037
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when you log on and play Xbox games, as Loki does a lot with Minecraft, you get reward points.

512
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:58,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hopefully you're claiming that.

513
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:00,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they're automatically credited.

514
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:01,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have to claim them, Loki.

515
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:01,999
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be a problem.

516
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:02,339
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

517
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:04,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's claimed.

518
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously with the number of points I have, it's claimed, I think.

519
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:11,043
[SPEAKER_02]: How many points?

520
00:47:11,184 --> 00:47:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm nosy.

521
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:12,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me check.

522
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:16,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox.

523
00:47:16,907 --> 00:47:17,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So curious.

524
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:19,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to know this before we move on with the story.

525
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:21,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on.

526
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:24,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do I see the points?

527
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:32,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine, when I'm logged into Windows, I can see it right in the... Oh, if you go to Microsoft Edge, it comes right up, I think.

528
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:34,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Edge.

529
00:47:35,878 --> 00:47:36,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

530
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,832
[SPEAKER_05]: While you're figuring it out, let me finish the story here.

531
00:47:42,212 --> 00:47:49,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Microsoft did announce some changes to the program, including Game Pass Quest for PC.

532
00:47:49,674 --> 00:47:54,956
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the big sort of thing there is that now when you play games on PC, you will be able to get credit as well.

533
00:47:55,216 --> 00:47:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And weekly point streaks are coming back.

534
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:59,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So another way to earn more points.

535
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:02,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Pass quests on consoles are reimagined

536
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:28,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just have to play for 15 minutes.

537
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't just log into the game and log off as some people were doing before.

538
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:36,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can get rewards for playing different Game Pass titles.

539
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you mix it up a little bit, you have to play more than just Minecraft, Loki.

540
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:44,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it says I have, I don't know if some of the stuff's expired or not, but it's 9,530.

541
00:48:46,465 --> 00:49:02,840
[SPEAKER_05]: that's actually not as many points as you think it's a decent amount but one month of ultimate is 13,000 points so it's not quite as many as you think I think some stuff's been expiring they kept sending me messages you better use them I'm like that could be but just get in there and cash out once in a while because you might you know

542
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be able to get some deals.

543
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:12,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I think you can get Minecraft Shop gift cards too in there, which might be things that... Oh, don't play that.

544
00:49:12,746 --> 00:49:13,226
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

545
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:14,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm completely serious.

546
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost positive you can redeem points for a Minecraft card, so do it.

547
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:46,086
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway or a Roblox card for the kid I think is in there too anyway yeah so this is changes to the reward programs good stuff if you are an Xbox gamer and yeah I think just a reminder they do have that I mean it takes a while to earn points but hey if you're accumulating the points like Loki is turn them in get yourself I mean with the 9,000 points Loki you can probably get at least a $10 Minecraft card which you know doesn't sound like a lot but $10 is $10 it can

548
00:49:48,147 --> 00:49:51,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just don't play Bedrock, so I would never use this.

549
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:52,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see what else is there.

550
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's some changes to the program, and I think they're going to be welcomed by a lot of folks.

551
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to this interesting story, Loki, about a game we used to talk a lot about.

552
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:06,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Peripherals for consoles that are gone?

553
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:16,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We were playing the Wii for a while recently, but now there's going to be a brand new Guitar Hero controller released for the Wii.

554
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,203
[SPEAKER_03]: this year from Hyperkin.

555
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:32,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is, of course, you know, like the original Wii Guitar Hero controllers, you pop in the Wii Remote and it is compatible with both Guitar Hero and Rock Band games.

556
00:50:34,587 --> 00:50:35,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know why you would need that.

557
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:43,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you really can't find any of these peripherals at your local, like, thrift store because they have mountains of them.

558
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

559
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks nice.

560
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:55,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised this is more for the Wii and not the PC, considering Fortnite, the music stuff.

561
00:50:55,235 --> 00:50:59,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that they had some tie-in with that type of thing.

562
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:04,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in our show role, but speaking of that, Fortnite is bringing that mode to the same room now.

563
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:05,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big upgrade.

564
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:09,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you know, but Fortnite Festival can only be played online right now, multiplayer.

565
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:13,679
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to make it so that you have the same room, so you can essentially have rock band parties again.

566
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so why wouldn't you do that for PC or like for like current consoles?

567
00:51:20,424 --> 00:51:21,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortnite did team up.

568
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:25,628
[SPEAKER_05]: There are official Fortnite festival peripherals for that for PC.

569
00:51:25,948 --> 00:51:26,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is that.

570
00:51:27,489 --> 00:51:30,832
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeRite also points out in chat, there's also good Wii to PC adapters and so forth.

571
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I think it is, Loki?

572
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of had a chuckle at this story, too.

573
00:51:34,313 --> 00:51:35,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, who's going to buy this for the Wii?

574
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:46,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think with all the retro gaming stuff and retro gaming's popularity, I actually think there is an audience for people looking for peripherals for old systems.

575
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:48,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, you fired up the Wii not that long ago.

576
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:49,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

577
00:51:50,279 --> 00:52:14,225
[SPEAKER_03]: like think about it like let's just like think about this so yeah like the Wii and stuff it's not there's a lot of games on the Wii like there's a lot of games that probably aren't worth I don't know what Guitar Hero is necessarily worth on the second-hand market probably not a lot um Guitar Hero it's like the Wii itself I'm not really sure how valuable that is because there were a lot of Wiis out there um

578
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:33,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe with all of these, all this inflation in price and all these sanctions on other companies and our laptops supposed to be going up 68% in price and game consoles skyrocketing because of all these tariffs.

579
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:36,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the Wii is going to come back.

580
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe used gaming is a more popular market.

581
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you're saying this, what's the patent?

582
00:52:43,722 --> 00:52:44,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

583
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:45,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, patent.

584
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,466
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the timeframe on patent expiration for hardware?

585
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:53,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Hence why we get all these Super Nintendo Genesis things that come out later.

586
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:53,991
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years, I think.

587
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:56,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what turns 20 years old next year?

588
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,057
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be part of the reason why, I wonder.

589
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:06,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think Guitar Hero for the Wii, it was originally back in 2009, it says.

590
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:11,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the Wii hardware itself is going to be 20 years old next year.

591
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:12,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you have... Bring it back!

592
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:13,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

593
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:16,011
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a copy of Guitar Hero floating around or what have you...

594
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:17,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you'll have a controller for that.

595
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:30,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm sure because of exactly all those things you said that the software is everywhere and it's that whole thing that once the patents are up on the Wii and third parties can make their own versions of the Wii it's going to happen.

596
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:31,267
[SPEAKER_05]: But

597
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:40,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I say that and I also kind of go, have we seen that happen with the GameCube or the PlayStation 2 or some of those other things?

598
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but they did explain why they are putting this out.

599
00:53:44,918 --> 00:53:48,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, we want to take a moment to thank our community for the passionate discussion surrounding...

600
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:50,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Our latest product launch.

601
00:53:50,665 --> 00:54:01,769
[SPEAKER_03]: The new HyperStormer was developed to meet the demand for an accessible and budget-friendly solution perfect for retro gamers who want to enter the guitar scene in 2025 at an affordable price.

602
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:06,131
[SPEAKER_03]: While we understand this is not what some fans were expecting, you can rest assured that this is just the beginning.

603
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It says we have...

604
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:15,669
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had fans struggling for years to buy used, potentially non-functional peripherals for hundreds of dollars online.

605
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:23,874
[SPEAKER_03]: While it is correct this is the same shell mold from a previous Hyperkin release from 2009, that's all it is.

606
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: We used the mold to make brand new shells, fitting it with 2024 internal components.

607
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:32,039
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not old school, nor is it old guitars I've been seeing in a warehouse.

608
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:35,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We are creating something new and it's really groundbreaking.

609
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:37,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, groundbreaking is probably a bit of a stretch.

610
00:54:37,764 --> 00:54:44,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see the whole, hey, we see the secondhand market where these are going for hundreds of dollars and we'd rather make that money.

611
00:54:45,611 --> 00:54:46,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

612
00:54:47,212 --> 00:54:49,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that, yeah.

613
00:54:49,474 --> 00:54:50,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, you know what?

614
00:54:50,836 --> 00:54:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: They can do whatever they want.

615
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:58,463
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to make a brand new controller for an old system, by golly, they can do it.

616
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:02,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still kind of curious.

617
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it has to do with disc versus cartridge.

618
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:10,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we seen the third-party PlayStations and PlayStation 2s?

619
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:11,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we have.

620
00:55:12,138 --> 00:55:15,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably because of the BIOS in those systems.

621
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that's what the key difference is.

622
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do the cartridges because you didn't have a system BIOS in that whole thing, whereas these newer ones you did.

623
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:27,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet maybe I just kind of talked myself out of my earlier theory.

624
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:29,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

625
00:55:30,182 --> 00:55:50,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that said, though, they have disc-based systems that play that stuff, FPGA stuff, because I want to say that they had a really expensive CD thing through, oh, who's that that does all the really expensive retro consoles?

626
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:51,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Limited run games?

627
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:53,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Retron?

628
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:53,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Retron.

629
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,418
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it's Retron.

630
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:57,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same company, Hyperkin, isn't it?

631
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:00,239
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not Retron.

632
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It is... Evercade.

633
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:03,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

634
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly not Evercade.

635
00:56:07,724 --> 00:56:08,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see...

636
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:16,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby in chat is talking about the way the electronics... Analog.

637
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:17,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It's analog.

638
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:18,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, they always sell it.

639
00:56:18,555 --> 00:56:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they had an analog CD system, I thought, or they were working on one.

640
00:56:24,022 --> 00:56:29,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had one, so I don't know how that works unless you've got to get the keys before you can play that, but...

641
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:48,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Trobo4 in chat gets a gold star for reading your mind they got it Bobby Blackwolf also says the electronics are in the Wii remote they don't have to make the electronic part that talks to the console on the Wii the Wii remote does it and that electronic part requires getting a license but you don't need a license to make a mold that takes in the Wii remote that's kind of interesting

642
00:56:50,134 --> 00:56:55,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, didn't the Wii remote kind of slip into the guitar's front so it could sense the tilting of the guitar?

643
00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:02,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it also just, it was essentially used for the wireless communication as well.

644
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, everything, yeah, let's just be said.

645
00:57:04,646 --> 00:57:05,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, interesting.

646
00:57:06,528 --> 00:57:07,608
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you know what?

647
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:10,351
[SPEAKER_05]: For all of you still rocking out to Guitar Hero on the Wii, good news.

648
00:57:11,189 --> 00:57:36,186
[SPEAKER_03]: but I could see where people are like let's bust it out for a party like when you know all the 40 year olds like when we were 21 let's play this game again I've still got all my Rock Band 2 stuff I don't know I think the only thing that I'm kind of iffy on is whether I still have that dumped to a hard drive on my Xbox 360 which is in a case somewhere but I still have all of my guitars and stuff in the garage

649
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:55,209
[SPEAKER_03]: my drum set's in a bag I bought the official rock band drum set bag to put the drum set in and I got all the I had everything for that and I played it almost never alright well speaking of retro goodness and stuff to inspire that Loki what else do you have?

650
00:57:56,812 --> 00:58:04,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so then we also have some word about a brand new LEGO set coming out because I'm always excited about that.

651
00:58:04,718 --> 00:58:09,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got my LEGO NES on top of my computer right here with that wonderful TV.

652
00:58:10,262 --> 00:58:16,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo has come out and confirmed that there is a LEGO Game Boy coming in October.

653
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:17,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all we know.

654
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:21,310
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what it's going to look like, how much it's going to be.

655
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,773
[SPEAKER_03]: All we know is it's going to be coming out.

656
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:44,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for somebody to mod it to give it a backlight or one of those tacky little clip-on lights that we all had to use to play it in the car at night when we were younger.

657
00:58:44,932 --> 00:58:46,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Some type of Lego clip-on light.

658
00:58:48,154 --> 00:58:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it says built for the classic Nintendo system in LEGO form coming October 2025.

659
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:58,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was from Nintendo.

660
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:08,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it's just this Game Boy or if they're going to be doing sets based off of that.

661
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:15,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Game Boy itself, assuming that you make it to scale, which is what I've got my Nintendo system, it's not that big.

662
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty small.

663
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if they would be doing more than just the Game Boy with that.

664
00:59:23,153 --> 00:59:23,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

665
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

666
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wait and see.

667
00:59:27,699 --> 00:59:28,000
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

668
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on to a classic game getting rebooted.

669
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:35,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know about this, and this is kind of neat that this is coming.

670
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:40,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But Carmen Sandiego from the game Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

671
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, there was Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?

672
00:59:42,476 --> 00:59:43,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?

673
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: The many Netflix series.

674
00:59:44,538 --> 00:59:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: The Netflix show.

675
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,242
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Show, we all know the, you know, Rockefeller.

676
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:54,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, that's the game I want to play in Rock Band on the Wii.

677
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:57,227
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway, Carmen Sandiego is coming back.

678
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:01,410
[SPEAKER_05]: It was announced by the developer Gameloft that Carmen Sandiego is going to launch for PS5.

679
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:07,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC on Steam, and iOS and Android.

680
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:08,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's even a mobile game.

681
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:09,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going everywhere.

682
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:17,362
[SPEAKER_05]: You will be able to get this game for $29.99 for the Standard Edition or $50, $49.99 for the Deluxe Edition.

683
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:18,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you pre-order it, you can get it for $39.99.

684
01:00:20,144 --> 01:00:23,607
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a physical version in mid-April for PS5 and Switch.

685
01:00:24,727 --> 01:00:27,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the 40th Anniversary Edition, which is also priced at $49.99.

686
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,392
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where parts get ridiculous because I'm like, it's fucking Carmen Sandiego.

687
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:40,617
[SPEAKER_05]: The Deluxe Edition has an anniversary caper, two cosmetic skins, a digital official soundtrack, and a digital art book.

688
01:00:41,018 --> 01:00:41,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like...

689
01:00:42,078 --> 01:00:43,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like a bunch of garbage.

690
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:48,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate the idea of cosmetic skins for fucking Carmen Sandiego.

691
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:49,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

692
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:50,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

693
01:00:50,903 --> 01:00:52,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess you don't have to have it, so whatever.

694
01:00:53,144 --> 01:00:55,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the part that annoys me about gaming today, as I'm sure a lot of you.

695
01:00:56,626 --> 01:00:58,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, the regular version of the game.

696
01:00:59,247 --> 01:00:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: will be out.

697
01:01:00,027 --> 01:01:03,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do you do in this game?

698
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:08,590
[SPEAKER_05]: You're chasing Vile, the enemy organization.

699
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:17,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you're a rookie gumshoe or a seasoned detective, you are playing either the main campaign or what they call the Acme Files, which is a classic mode.

700
01:01:18,313 --> 01:01:19,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of cool with that.

701
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:20,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

702
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:25,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, in the game, you're actually playing Carmen Sandiego herself.

703
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:32,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you actually are trying to outwit vile operations to outwit them, I guess.

704
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:39,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You get new tools, you gear up, you travel the globe to different areas, marketing talk, publicity talk.

705
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't it neat that this thing from our youth is being put out all over again in regular and limited editions?

706
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you supposed to be catching Carmen Sandiego?

707
01:01:50,348 --> 01:01:52,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you playing Carmen Sandiego?

708
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:53,851
[SPEAKER_05]: They're flipping the script.

709
01:01:54,972 --> 01:01:57,914
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point, they said, what if you were the ghost in Pac-Man?

710
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:01,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man Versus came out, and it was probably the best one in the series.

711
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:04,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, sometimes they flip the script a little.

712
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:07,382
[SPEAKER_03]: What if Pac-Man was a horror series?

713
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we've got that now, too.

714
01:02:09,504 --> 01:02:10,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you just talked about the Game Boy.

715
01:02:10,785 --> 01:02:12,127
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Wario Land?

716
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:12,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

717
01:02:12,787 --> 01:02:13,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Wario where?

718
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:13,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Wario Land.

719
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,350
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more Wario games.

720
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,151
[SPEAKER_03]: WarioWare Shake, it was fantastic.

721
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:21,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs to be put on modern consoles.

722
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

723
01:02:24,393 --> 01:02:27,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Or make a Mario game like that that's all hand-drawn and animated.

724
01:02:28,295 --> 01:02:28,715
[SPEAKER_03]: That was...

725
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:30,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

726
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:40,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I think another thing to give you a serious answer on the why are you playing as Carmen Sandiego front, I think because for this generation, they've kind of turned her into the hero.

727
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:43,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if I remember right, the Netflix series, she was the star.

728
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't about catching Carmen Sandiego.

729
01:02:45,697 --> 01:02:47,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about following Carmen Sandiego.

730
01:02:47,758 --> 01:02:52,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So at some point in the last 10 years, the narrative on the whole series flipped.

731
01:02:53,081 --> 01:02:56,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in the game show, you were trying to catch Carmen Sandiego, but kids don't remember that.

732
01:02:57,124 --> 01:02:57,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

733
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:57,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We all...

734
01:02:59,145 --> 01:03:03,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is ever going to top the game show and watching a kid not be able to label all the countries correctly.

735
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the game show, too.

736
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:09,337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the game show is good, but I'm talking about the old original cartoon that they had as well where they were chasing Carmageddon in San Diego.

737
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:10,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that was so long ago.

738
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: So long ago.

739
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:12,981
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

740
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:13,441
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

741
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:14,543
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

742
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:38,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these rumors and leaks and things that are from respected sources are looking to shake up the Dead by Daylight game.

743
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:40,490
[SPEAKER_05]: 2v8 is set to return.

744
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that 2v8 has been very popular in the game.

745
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:45,873
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is typically four on one.

746
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:51,790
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it's going to be 2v8 in a special mode, as we've seen a couple of times.

747
01:03:52,151 --> 01:03:55,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like Resident Evil is going to be involved in this return.

748
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:59,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other things we already know that have been confirmed for Dead by Daylight over the next few months.

749
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:03,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We know Five Nights at Freddy's, that collaboration is coming.

750
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,841
[SPEAKER_05]: That was confirmed.

751
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:07,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there is an anniversary chapter coming.

752
01:04:08,204 --> 01:04:11,887
[SPEAKER_05]: The leaks are saying, take it with a grain of salt, but the leaks are saying...

753
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:13,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't fucking believe this.

754
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Jurassic World is the crossover.

755
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they going to put dinosaurs in Dead by Daylight?

756
01:04:20,962 --> 01:04:22,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you get to play as a velociraptor?

757
01:04:23,323 --> 01:04:25,024
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you damn well might be.

758
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe at least you get to play some of the heroes.

759
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:36,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, if I can be Jonathan Bailey, who's starring in the new trilogy, if I can be Jonathan Bailey in Dead by Daylight, yes.

760
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:37,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Period.

761
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:38,133
[SPEAKER_05]: End of sentence.

762
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:39,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

763
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:40,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

764
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:41,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonathan Bailey...

765
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:43,892
[SPEAKER_05]: is hot.

766
01:04:44,492 --> 01:04:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm going to say.

767
01:04:47,374 --> 01:04:53,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I can play as him in Dead by Daylight and maybe it's just a survivor thing, but if I can play as a dinosaur too, I think that's really fucking funny.

768
01:04:54,300 --> 01:05:01,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, Dead by Daylight has all sorts of spirits and ghouls and the Demi Gorgon from Stranger Things.

769
01:05:01,706 --> 01:05:03,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like, you know, and the...

770
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:06,650
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

771
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:29,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the new 2v8 mode is looking to be Resident Evil themed.

772
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:36,582
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from some leaks not only on X from sources that tend to get these things right, but a Discord based on DBD leaks.

773
01:05:36,963 --> 01:05:39,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like the 2v8 may be Resident Evil themed.

774
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:43,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there may be some more Resident Evil content coming as well.

775
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks are theorizing, as usual, that...

776
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:51,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Lady Dimitrescu may come out but she might come out as a legendary skin.

777
01:05:51,836 --> 01:05:59,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those that don't know there are legendary skins that will transform existing characters with existing movesets and everything into something else.

778
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:03,750
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of these for survivors like Alan Wake had quite a few of these.

779
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,353
[SPEAKER_05]: You could play as like the waitress character or you could play as the

780
01:06:06,954 --> 01:06:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Other Detective, and Alan Wake 2.

781
01:06:08,536 --> 01:06:12,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember any of these names right now, but those are legendary skins.

782
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:13,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill has a ton of these.

783
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:18,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheryl Mason is the main skin, but you can legendary transform into James.

784
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:25,353
[SPEAKER_05]: You can transform into Alyssa, the cop from the first game.

785
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:28,136
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these characters you can transform into.

786
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:56,634
[SPEAKER_05]: so the rumor is Lady Dimitrescu may actually be a legendary skin and I was thinking about it I could see that they could make a legendary skin for Nemesis and make it work so they could change the zombies into the vampire sisters instead and then instead of a tentacle like she would just have something else maybe her big hat I don't know but she'd have something else that she could attack you with so I could see that actually really working so I hope they do it I love Lady Dimitrescu as a character

787
01:06:57,194 --> 01:07:25,033
[SPEAKER_05]: so, also the new 2v8 mode map will of course be the Raccoon City Police Station which ironically used to be one big map and then they split it into two so it may just kind of be coming back as one giant map in the future so I guess we'll see what happens with that so, yeah, lots to come with the future of Dead by Daylight again, those are leaks right now but the DBD links tend to be correct so, yeah

788
01:07:25,733 --> 01:07:30,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Sjo and Hunter Matt in chat says, I'm kind of surprised Art the Clown isn't a killer at this point.

789
01:07:30,399 --> 01:07:32,381
[SPEAKER_05]: That, of course, being the character from Terrafire.

790
01:07:33,222 --> 01:07:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a little bit surprised.

791
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,387
[SPEAKER_05]: There is already a clown character in the game.

792
01:07:37,748 --> 01:07:40,291
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a original killer simply called the Clown.

793
01:07:41,011 --> 01:08:06,089
[SPEAKER_05]: which is probably making it difficult for Pennywise or you know but again the hillbilly was always supposed was one of the original killers when the game first came out and that was always basically Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and they made they figured a way to make both characters work so there's no reason we can't have more clowns in the game you know for all of you that just love clowns but let's a lot of clowns are scary but

794
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:30,412
[SPEAKER_05]: and so Art the Clown, pretty scary Pennywise, at least the Tim Curry version very fucking scary so I'm all for those killers coming to Dead by Daylight at some point but it sounds like you might have to settle for a Velociraptor nice or maybe you'll get to be that dinosaur that killed Nedry and you'll spit blinding stuff that could kind of work as a survivor mechanic

795
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't pronounce that dinosaur's name.

796
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Dilophosaurus or something like that?

797
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:35,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?

798
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:37,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something like that.

799
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:38,667
[SPEAKER_03]: They're spitters!

800
01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:39,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, spitting dinosaurs.

801
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

802
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:42,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on, Loki.

803
01:08:44,216 --> 01:08:44,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

804
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Xbox showcase, we're going to be getting that here very soon.

805
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:53,681
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be showcasing a few different games that are coming out.

806
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:57,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going to take place on January 23rd at 1 p.m.

807
01:08:57,362 --> 01:08:57,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern.

808
01:08:58,522 --> 01:09:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And the games that they're going to be covering, Doom the Dark Ages, South of Midnight, Clear Obscure Expedition 33.

809
01:09:06,525 --> 01:09:10,347
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be doing some deep dives in those.

810
01:09:10,707 --> 01:09:11,147
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

811
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:13,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I am very excited about Doom the Dark Ages.

812
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to check that out.

813
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:20,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting that that's coming out, and every time that I remember again, I'm like, ooh, yes.

814
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's nice to know some company for sure is doing some announcements this month.

815
01:09:25,674 --> 01:09:26,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We can bank on that.

816
01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:29,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

817
01:09:29,895 --> 01:09:35,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there may be some other things they also show off as well, but at least those are the few that were highlighted.

818
01:09:36,380 --> 01:10:05,574
[SPEAKER_05]: so I'm looking forward to it I think I know it's early and a lot of you are going to go Rob you're silly but I think they should confirm a sequel to Indiana Jones I think they should just say hey we heard you love the game sequels and development because I hope it's true and we've heard all the talk about you know Disney wants one we know it did very well for Microsoft Bethesda that's been a really good success story for them so I really think they should just strike with the irons hot and confirm a sequels and development

819
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:28,406
[SPEAKER_03]: although yes it would be a few years out um but like it would be the first xbox game xbox game to take years and years to develop where it wouldn't be starting from zero like you know yeah the system systems are already built uh assets are you know started or at least they have some assets for it so it's not i don't think the turnaround time would be that much

820
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:29,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be, yeah.

821
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:33,623
[SPEAKER_05]: If they were to make something that's very similar to the game they already did.

822
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:36,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully they built that game with a trilogy in mind already.

823
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:38,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you really know.

824
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:41,894
[SPEAKER_05]: If they built it on a backbone that's easily adaptable.

825
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:42,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

826
01:10:43,136 --> 01:10:43,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

827
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:47,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that might be something they save for a summertime announcement, though, to be fair.

828
01:10:47,659 --> 01:10:48,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

829
01:10:49,400 --> 01:11:01,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk about, this is a little bit of a follow-up, because last week we were talking about the company MyArcade, which does hardware, and we were talking about the Atari Game Station, which is something that they knew they were going to announce at CES.

830
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:02,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they announced...

831
01:11:02,947 --> 01:11:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how that thing too, I just noticed on that, it has like the trackball and the knob and the numpad on it.

832
01:11:09,393 --> 01:11:09,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

833
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:10,874
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool looking.

834
01:11:10,894 --> 01:11:12,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

835
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:15,838
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a few things that they've actually announced at the event.

836
01:11:15,878 --> 01:11:21,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So they also announced a Game Station Retro Go, which is combining Namco and Capcom games.

837
01:11:22,064 --> 01:11:26,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the only downside to this thing is it's the same fucking games you've seen every time.

838
01:11:27,268 --> 01:11:27,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time.

839
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:31,850
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Street Fighter, Mega Man, Strider, Final Fight.

840
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:39,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally every game on the machine behind me that Arcade 1UP put out, but Bionic Commando is there too, which would be, I'm pretty sure, the arcade version of that.

841
01:11:39,953 --> 01:11:41,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Namco is all the same games.

842
01:11:41,993 --> 01:11:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any of these are new.

843
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:46,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Pole Position, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally-X, Galaga, Dig Dug.

844
01:11:47,255 --> 01:11:48,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the games you've seen before.

845
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:53,898
[SPEAKER_05]: But not to minimize it, because it is a nice little combination of forces there, and that's pretty neat.

846
01:11:54,298 --> 01:11:56,139
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

847
01:12:22,312 --> 01:12:27,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It plays Super Nintendo and Genesis games Yes, both You plug one on the bottom, one on the top

848
01:12:28,248 --> 01:12:33,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It honestly looks like something that somebody would make, you know, how they make the portable consoles or whatever.

849
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It resembles something that someone would make like that.

850
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any interest in any of these types of products?

851
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I buy some of them, but... I don't.

852
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:47,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many consoles that I don't use.

853
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:55,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, we do still get use out of the Playdate and stuff.

854
01:12:55,356 --> 01:12:56,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I have looked at Evercade's

855
01:12:57,885 --> 01:13:03,069
[SPEAKER_03]: The handheld, you know, the one that takes all those cartridges and stuff.

856
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:06,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I have looked at that I'd say once a week.

857
01:13:07,212 --> 01:13:08,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I've considered it.

858
01:13:08,532 --> 01:13:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know how much I would really play with that.

859
01:13:11,514 --> 01:13:12,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like...

860
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:22,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, even though it's kind of like a legally gray area, I do see some of those ads on TikTok and stuff for these retro game consoles that have emulators and stuff.

861
01:13:22,326 --> 01:13:23,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And I obviously wouldn't buy something like that.

862
01:13:24,027 --> 01:13:35,372
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like, if I was going to do something like that, I would want something that does have a large library of everything that can just dump on one console instead of having all these little consoles for everything.

863
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:38,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why Steam Decks and emulators are great.

864
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

865
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.

866
01:13:40,472 --> 01:13:42,893
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's nice to officially support what you can, too.

867
01:13:43,554 --> 01:13:49,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, yeah, and so, like, I'm not... I probably won't do that, but, you know, never say never.

868
01:13:49,118 --> 01:13:55,863
[SPEAKER_03]: There may be some stuff down the road that, like, there's something that has the right type of games with it or something, or maybe...

869
01:13:57,222 --> 01:14:05,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Evercade puts out a thing that plays the Evercade cartridges, but it also plays Super Nintendo cartridges and also plays this, you know, or, yeah, I don't know.

870
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:06,710
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

871
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

872
01:14:07,631 --> 01:14:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's talk about the Atari Game Station Go, also from Retro, or excuse me, My Arcade, which we talked about last week.

873
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:14,517
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the details now.

874
01:14:14,557 --> 01:14:16,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be out the third quarter of 2025 for $150.

875
01:14:16,058 --> 01:14:18,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It has 200 games pre-installed, including things like Pac-Man,

876
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:42,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Missile Command, Centipede, Breakout, Star Raiders and it also has controllers for those games and so forth pretty neat and you know there's a paddle that's pretty neat and there's a small baby little trackball yeah this device looks pretty cool not since not every game uses every controller function there are LED lights that just illuminate what you need for a particular game

877
01:14:43,063 --> 01:14:44,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a creative little thing as well.

878
01:14:44,945 --> 01:14:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of nice.

879
01:15:07,543 --> 01:15:08,944
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

880
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:39,398
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's about the same size as one of the miniature arcade machines.

881
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:45,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the baby ones, but the ones that are similar to the ones behind me when I broadcast live that are sitting on the tabletop.

882
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:47,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks to be about that size.

883
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:49,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about the size of like...

884
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:51,431
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

885
01:16:10,273 --> 01:16:12,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tattoo in our chat says,

886
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, I also have, it's harder to see because it's always, but I have a little Atari 2600, like a whole little console with preloaded games.

887
01:16:38,729 --> 01:16:42,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought, that's also a My Arcade, and I bought that at Costco.

888
01:16:44,677 --> 01:16:46,278
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is not here tonight.

889
01:16:46,298 --> 01:16:47,679
[SPEAKER_05]: We are still going to carry on with her segment.

890
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:48,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get to the classic game of the week.

891
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:30,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

892
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:34,041
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

893
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:37,784
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and with DarkSakura not here tonight, Loki, what did you pick?

894
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:39,465
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just messing with you.

895
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you covered.

896
01:17:40,126 --> 01:17:40,306
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

897
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:42,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked nothing.

898
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:44,162
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no classics.

899
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I literally had put you on the spot, though, like that?

900
01:17:46,503 --> 01:17:47,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really funny.

901
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:49,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what would I have picked?

902
01:17:49,145 --> 01:17:49,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's easy.

903
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:51,307
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, save it for next time.

904
01:17:51,387 --> 01:17:51,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time.

905
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:51,927
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

906
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:57,552
[SPEAKER_05]: For now, though, I went ahead and jumped in tonight, and the game we have picked for tonight is a really old game.

907
01:17:57,872 --> 01:18:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura has been doing these games that are like 10 years old.

908
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:02,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pick a game that's 45 years old this year, okay?

909
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:06,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about as old as, you know, the host of this program.

910
01:18:06,778 --> 01:18:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a game called Wizard of War, but it's W-O-R because they're warriors.

911
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:19,965
[SPEAKER_05]: This game had a speech chip in it, which again for 1980 was very, you know, revolutionary.

912
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But the voice sounded like this.

913
01:18:23,647 --> 01:18:25,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention, warriors.

914
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:26,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's very, very...

915
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,871
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

916
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,201
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

917
01:19:02,556 --> 01:19:28,992
[SPEAKER_05]: a red scorpion kind of creature and then once you clear everything out of a level you'll get the bonus the insect kind of fly looking warlock that flies around the screen really fast and if you shoot it you get a double score dungeon for your next round and then of course later into the game on later boards the wizard of war shows up a blue wizard that just basically ports around and does whatever the fuck he wants to try to eat your quarters he's very very difficult but yeah

918
01:19:30,513 --> 01:19:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: This game eventually was ported, not just the, and I apologize, there are some serious flashes in this game.

919
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:39,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I was made a note to give you the warning and then I forgot.

920
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:42,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you do get double score dungeons, the game does flash in a way.

921
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:46,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry about that if that's throwing you as we broadcast live here.

922
01:19:47,018 --> 01:19:58,782
[SPEAKER_05]: This game was not just in the arcades, but it did get ported to Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, the Commodore Max, and of course, where I played this game the most,

923
01:20:00,003 --> 01:20:02,744
[SPEAKER_05]: that version.

924
01:20:04,165 --> 01:20:14,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting enough, in the two-player game, not only, because of course we want to eat quarters as fast as we can, not only do you shoot the monsters in the level, you can shoot each other!

925
01:20:15,532 --> 01:20:16,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful!

926
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:20,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game did have friendly fire, which was kind of annoying to be honest, but it was there.

927
01:20:21,993 --> 01:20:31,415
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have the strategy of standing back to back, like in a corner, you can pretty much just fire at anything that comes at you and you can get very far in the game.

928
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So although it was kind of a mean mechanic, it was a really easy one to sort of cheese.

929
01:20:35,856 --> 01:20:42,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say characters do kind of appear and disappear and they start to move very fast and they might appear on top of you and that's not very pleasant.

930
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:44,918
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not foolproof, but yeah.

931
01:20:45,538 --> 01:20:59,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, in each dungeon you have basically a big blue screen and the monsters, they will appear and disappear as they move, but there is a radar at the bottom that always shows you where those monsters are.

932
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:05,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you kind of read the radar, you can kind of guess where to shoot and you'll be able to actually hit the monsters.

933
01:21:05,635 --> 01:21:08,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was actually kind of a neat mechanic, especially for its time.

934
01:21:08,598 --> 01:21:09,058
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

935
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

936
01:21:51,738 --> 01:21:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: and Dragonet.

937
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play a little audio.

938
01:21:53,723 --> 01:21:54,725
[SPEAKER_05]: See if you recognize this.

939
01:22:00,768 --> 01:22:05,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and play that before every board that you would actually go through in that game.

940
01:22:07,592 --> 01:22:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that last note was if you had a double score dungeon.

941
01:22:11,574 --> 01:22:16,096
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people recognize the theme because it sounds like they basically stole it from Dragnet.

942
01:22:16,176 --> 01:22:22,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it was a classic piece that they were able to adapt easy or because it was only five notes or people weren't paying attention to video games as much in 1980.

943
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but it had that very familiar riff to a lot of people.

944
01:22:28,763 --> 01:22:29,843
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

945
01:22:48,849 --> 01:22:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

946
01:23:09,787 --> 01:23:11,307
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

947
01:23:35,512 --> 01:24:00,288
[SPEAKER_05]: and the last time I remember playing this game was actually at Southern Fried Game Expo which was of course that arcade show that happens out in Atlanta that I went to a couple years ago and I actually still could do alright at this game I actually think I got on the high scoreboard for this game I did play enough of it on my Commodore 64 and plus when you're only playing one player you're not having to worry about shooting each other it's a little bit easier so there is that

948
01:24:00,928 --> 01:24:28,007
[SPEAKER_05]: so uh yeah quest buster in chat says old school pvp the sound effects were so good yeah um pretty pretty fun stuff i enjoyed this game i put a lot of hours in it and this is definitely definitely a classic at damn near 45 years old classic game of the week wizard of war w o r have you ever played that game loki very old i don't think so it's it's

949
01:24:28,547 --> 01:24:50,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you ever see an arcade machine at one of these classic arcade shows at like California Extreme or, you know, Southern Fried or wherever in your town, definitely worth a look just because, you know, it was like the, not the first game to have speech, but one of the earliest that had the very, but it's very hard to understand what the thing is saying.

950
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:53,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very robotic voice.

951
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:56,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really, yeah, very rudimentary, but it worked.

952
01:24:56,321 --> 01:24:56,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked.

953
01:24:57,742 --> 01:25:04,727
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on and talk about some rapid-fire news and cover some news going on really quickly here.

954
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:05,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

955
01:25:06,108 --> 01:25:17,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's going to disappoint a lot of you that have been holding out hope for a game that probably was never going to come out for that system that is not supported anymore whatsoever.

956
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, multiple systems aren't supported anymore, but the Mighty No.

957
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,302
[SPEAKER_03]: 9 for the 3DS and the Vita...

958
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:28,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Your pre-orders have been cancelled by Amazon, unfortunately.

959
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:38,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering the 3DS all-but-ended support a few years ago, I mean, I know if you still have one and can turn it on, you can still play it, but it's just funny.

960
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: The online store has been gone how long now?

961
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just funny.

962
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:50,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's unfortunate that you will never be able to play that game, even though we

963
01:25:51,758 --> 01:25:52,378
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

964
01:26:14,575 --> 01:26:24,628
[SPEAKER_03]: and then of course we got some companies doing some good stuff at least so Final Fantasy 14 is giving folks a reprieve of

965
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:25,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

966
01:26:46,028 --> 01:26:57,296
[SPEAKER_03]: and so they basically suspended that so folks that are not in their house or maybe without a house at this point aren't going to lose their other house in-game as well.

967
01:26:57,596 --> 01:26:59,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's nice when Final Fantasy does things like this.

968
01:26:59,937 --> 01:27:01,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a little silly.

969
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,800
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing that made Alan Rage quit the game.

970
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:08,663
[SPEAKER_05]: He lost his house because he didn't log in within 45 days and he was like, well, fuck it.

971
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:09,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked all this for the house.

972
01:27:09,964 --> 01:27:10,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck this game, basically.

973
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a bummer they have timer on houses at all.

974
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:16,429
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

975
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:36,631
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

976
01:27:52,119 --> 01:27:58,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But on a different note, you know, since you did bring up the fires in Southern California, that's been tremendously difficult to hear about.

977
01:27:58,306 --> 01:28:00,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think people know, but that is nowhere near us.

978
01:28:01,069 --> 01:28:03,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We are on the complete other end of the state in Northern California.

979
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:05,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's nothing to do with us here.

980
01:28:05,594 --> 01:28:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly our hearts go out.

981
01:28:08,797 --> 01:28:12,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I know tons of people in Southern California and smoke in the air and

982
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:13,241
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

983
01:28:35,151 --> 01:29:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's also a lot of misinformation on the internet about the fires I would really encourage you if something is trying to tug at your heartstrings emotionally to get you to repost it or reclick it it's never a bad question to ask yourself is this actually true because there's unfortunately a lot of BS out there right now but the truth is those people out there need help and if you can donate to a reputable charity I'm going to be honest I would discourage

984
01:29:05,191 --> 01:29:10,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you know the people directly, the individual GoFundMes and stuff like that, because unfortunately there are a lot of bad actors out there.

985
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:19,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would look at charities that are actively, you know, whether that be the Red Cross or another charity that really speaks to you, working with those types of relief efforts.

986
01:29:20,197 --> 01:29:22,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's just horrible.

987
01:29:22,718 --> 01:29:23,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrible, horrible, horrible.

988
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I see a lot of love and chat going on out there.

989
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:28,520
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt says, those fires have been awful.

990
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoping for the best for everyone.

991
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,161
[SPEAKER_05]: PodCulture says those fires are fucking massive.

992
01:29:32,221 --> 01:29:32,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are.

993
01:29:32,821 --> 01:29:33,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really scary.

994
01:29:34,062 --> 01:29:34,182
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

995
01:29:35,387 --> 01:29:35,848
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

996
01:29:43,567 --> 01:29:44,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Really hard to hear about.

997
01:29:45,048 --> 01:29:45,328
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

998
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:47,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on, though.

999
01:29:47,329 --> 01:29:50,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Focusing on gamers doing good and raising money for charity.

1000
01:29:50,571 --> 01:29:53,732
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the biggest names in the business wrapped up their big marathon this week.

1001
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome Games Done Quick totaled a donation amount above $2.5 million.

1002
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:03,318
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to be exact, $2,556,500 raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation from running games very quickly.

1003
01:30:03,338 --> 01:30:03,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, yes...

1004
01:30:09,861 --> 01:30:12,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Included Crazy Taxi with a live backing band.

1005
01:30:12,664 --> 01:30:18,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I think I mentioned earlier in the show, I saw the 1 million being broken with Chunathan and that being played and all that.

1006
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:21,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's lots of stuff all over that.

1007
01:30:21,473 --> 01:30:22,494
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also some donate.

1008
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:24,856
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not just things that were raised by gamers.

1009
01:30:25,197 --> 01:30:27,519
[SPEAKER_05]: There were donations through partners, Fangamer.

1010
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,163
[SPEAKER_05]: The ET has donated many times before, Humble Bundle.

1011
01:30:31,403 --> 01:30:42,352
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the same names you usually see with these types of charity drives but still really really cool to see the entire community get involved did you know someone beat Elden Ring on a saxophone, Loki?

1012
01:30:42,652 --> 01:30:49,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that I don't know how that's possible but I saw that well it's like playing Dreamcast games with a fishing controller why would you do it?

1013
01:30:49,658 --> 01:30:51,059
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can

1014
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

1015
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:58,366
[SPEAKER_05]: One more quick note for you, and that is that The Last of Us Season 2, we know when it's coming.

1016
01:30:58,426 --> 01:30:59,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming in April.

1017
01:31:01,008 --> 01:31:02,690
[SPEAKER_05]: HBO and Max announced this.

1018
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:05,712
[SPEAKER_05]: This was also a PlayStation Productions announcement.

1019
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:07,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this was a part of...

1020
01:31:07,814 --> 01:31:10,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony doing some various announcements at CES.

1021
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:11,736
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a few more in just a moment.

1022
01:31:12,057 --> 01:31:16,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, The Last of Us Season 2 will be out April of 2025.

1023
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:20,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So you actually don't have to wait a terribly long time for this.

1024
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:26,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first season, obviously, critical success, not just consumer success.

1025
01:31:26,445 --> 01:31:33,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of expectations around the second series, especially when the second game, a little controversial for some people.

1026
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:35,051
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think some of those...

1027
01:31:36,849 --> 01:31:40,551
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to play out better in a TV thing.

1028
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:49,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Because people aren't going to be pissed about who they might have to take control of in the game and who might the game kind of push as a hero or whatever.

1029
01:31:49,675 --> 01:31:51,716
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole weird controversy going with that.

1030
01:31:52,096 --> 01:31:55,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But in a movie, it's all kind of out there, which will be very interesting.

1031
01:31:56,318 --> 01:32:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very curious to see if it does as well as critically as the first series did.

1032
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:03,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, how much they mirror the game.

1033
01:32:03,721 --> 01:32:05,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, if you know the game...

1034
01:32:05,902 --> 01:32:32,957
[SPEAKER_05]: some major happens kind of early on and I wouldn't be surprised if they try to get through all of season two before that happens because that would make for a better finale for season two to be honest but we'll see we'll see anyway I'm being vague on purpose because even though the game is old I realize now people are experiencing the story through the show so if you want to seek out spoilers go for it but at the same time there's nothing that says the show has to follow the book

1035
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:36,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Game of Thrones didn't at some point.

1036
01:32:37,288 --> 01:32:37,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't.

1037
01:32:37,888 --> 01:32:38,669
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no book.

1038
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: There was only they had to do an entire season based on concepts of a plan and it showed.

1039
01:32:45,753 --> 01:32:46,033
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1040
01:32:47,174 --> 01:32:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on.

1041
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:51,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's travel the world and check out some release dates and check out some games coming out near you.

1042
01:32:51,676 --> 01:32:52,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start in the US, Loki.

1043
01:32:53,976 --> 01:32:58,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well in the US, we don't have a ton, but we've got a few things coming out this week.

1044
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:02,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting off with Turnip Boy robs a bank.

1045
01:33:03,464 --> 01:33:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going from insurance fraud to robbing a bank now.

1046
01:33:07,688 --> 01:33:09,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's on iOS and Android.

1047
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Loki, since we brought up Awesome Games Done Quick, sorry.

1048
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:21,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see that for like a lot of the incentives that were named the character, Luigi was being named as the character for like a lot of those incentives.

1049
01:33:22,035 --> 01:33:23,935
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Mario Party fans out there.

1050
01:33:24,196 --> 01:33:25,636
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Mario Party fans.

1051
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:26,817
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of Mario Party fans.

1052
01:33:26,897 --> 01:33:28,217
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the year Luigi again.

1053
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:30,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

1054
01:33:30,818 --> 01:33:31,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

1055
01:33:31,798 --> 01:33:38,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, wouldn't that be a gag if Nintendo came out and said it's the year of Luigi again?

1056
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:41,405
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet would literally shit.

1057
01:33:41,785 --> 01:33:42,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen.

1058
01:33:44,747 --> 01:33:50,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo does have people, even in Japan, that sit in the corner and say, that might not be a good idea.

1059
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:51,352
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't do that.

1060
01:33:51,572 --> 01:33:52,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.

1061
01:33:52,673 --> 01:33:54,714
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the Pokemon leaks did that.

1062
01:33:54,854 --> 01:34:08,803
[SPEAKER_05]: There were certain Pokemon they strayed away from because they said there's actually a fan Pokemon that's really close to this that we need to actually... So you saw things where it was like fan speculation, so it was actively creatively hurting Pokemon, which was interesting.

1063
01:34:10,304 --> 01:34:25,678
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt has the trick Year of Waluigi It's his time It's his time Sorry Loki We have Blade Chimera on PC, Nintendo Switch

1064
01:34:26,604 --> 01:34:37,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Nintendo Switch, Dreadout Remastered Collection on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5.

1065
01:34:38,608 --> 01:34:45,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Markle Ragas Rage on PC and Xbox Series.

1066
01:34:47,279 --> 01:35:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see Dynasty Warriors Origins on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Tales of Graces F Remastered on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series I would like to point out one thing though I noticed it's kind of strange to me

1067
01:35:09,915 --> 01:35:15,357
[SPEAKER_03]: and just follow me and this might leak more credence into the whole November 17th announcement.

1068
01:35:15,998 --> 01:35:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean January 17th?

1069
01:35:18,419 --> 01:35:19,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, January 17th.

1070
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo games typically come out on Fridays.

1071
01:35:23,221 --> 01:35:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming out on a Thursday.

1072
01:35:25,666 --> 01:35:26,406
[SPEAKER_03]: That's strange.

1073
01:35:28,827 --> 01:35:29,867
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems strange.

1074
01:35:29,987 --> 01:35:34,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it doesn't really matter, but that seems strange to me.

1075
01:35:34,889 --> 01:35:37,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That it's coming out on a Thursday and not a Friday.

1076
01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for the last several months, and way back to when I was working at a video game distributor, Nintendo typically releases their games on Fridays.

1077
01:35:50,765 --> 01:36:16,444
[SPEAKER_03]: they're annoying in the sense that they're one of the only companies that was doing it at the time and then everybody started following suit whereas we prefer that it was on Tuesdays where that's when major movie releases on video come out but it is strange that this is on a Thursday instead of a Friday not that they couldn't release a game and make an announcement the same day but it does seem strange to me alright

1078
01:36:17,935 --> 01:36:18,375
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1079
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Tales of Grace's F Remastered, also out in Japan on that same day, January 16th.

1080
01:36:45,477 --> 01:36:49,440
[SPEAKER_05]: A game called Kenka Banshu Otome Double Pack is also out in Japan.

1081
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,362
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's a double pack, I'm trying to see which two games is it.

1082
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:55,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

1083
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no description for this, but it looks like it's one of those like bros in high school simulation type of games and that whole thing.

1084
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:08,007
[SPEAKER_05]: A game called Even If Tempest, Dawning Connections, also out on the 16th.

1085
01:37:08,427 --> 01:37:10,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all releases on the Nintendo Switch.

1086
01:37:10,949 --> 01:37:16,412
[SPEAKER_05]: If I look at the PlayStation 5, we have Sin Duality, Echo of Ada.

1087
01:37:16,832 --> 01:37:18,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Tales of Graces F Remastered

1088
01:37:34,681 --> 01:38:01,356
[SPEAKER_05]: we also have on the 17th Dynasty Warriors Origins also gets a limited edition release in Japan I don't know if there's a regular release for that I'm just seeing a limited edition for whatever reason so oh no there it is up there so we also have yeah Dynasty Warriors Origins is also getting a regular edition sorry this release list I'm looking at is kind of messy all over the place but I guess they're just getting the calendar arranged all right let's look at the UK Loki

1089
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so in the UK we've got looks like also Donkey Kong Country Returns HD also on the 16th.

1090
01:38:12,965 --> 01:38:13,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It's around the country.

1091
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:15,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know what to say about that.

1092
01:38:16,007 --> 01:38:30,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Tales of Graces F Remastered on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, PC and Switch and Dynasty Warriors Origins on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and that's it.

1093
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:32,703
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1094
01:38:33,244 --> 01:38:36,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we got a couple more news stories for you, and then we'll get to the listener roundtable.

1095
01:38:36,545 --> 01:38:42,907
[SPEAKER_05]: If any of you want to call in tonight over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord, although I would encourage you to join the Discord chat with us throughout the week.

1096
01:38:43,828 --> 01:38:45,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking about, you know, whatever.

1097
01:38:45,849 --> 01:38:47,469
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys put a lot of good suggestions in chat.

1098
01:38:47,509 --> 01:38:51,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We pull some of those stories for what we talk about, and sometimes we just get to chatting.

1099
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:53,492
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the other night, it was actually...

1100
01:38:54,272 --> 01:38:55,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, I don't know if y'all know this.

1101
01:38:56,133 --> 01:39:02,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Tuesday night when I was kind of sitting on the information about Mr. Smush and kind of needed something to take my mind off it for a little bit.

1102
01:39:03,297 --> 01:39:07,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually got into the VOG Discord and we were chatting about something completely unrelated and I was actually in there chatting.

1103
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,680
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a good little chat.

1104
01:39:09,101 --> 01:39:13,884
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if y'all know, but that was actually helping me keep my mind off of other stuff.

1105
01:39:13,944 --> 01:39:14,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks.

1106
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1107
01:39:16,565 --> 01:39:19,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's get to the rest of the news.

1108
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1109
01:39:20,717 --> 01:39:22,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is interesting.

1110
01:39:22,258 --> 01:39:29,743
[SPEAKER_03]: So, apparently, Sony Movie Studios are going to be making some more Sony property movies.

1111
01:39:30,424 --> 01:39:37,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, some of these aren't... I mean, none of them are very surprising, the two successful franchises.

1112
01:39:37,128 --> 01:39:39,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Horizon Zero Dawn...

1113
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Helldivers 2 and an anime spinoff of Ghost of Tsushima.

1114
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on board with Horizon.

1115
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on board with Ghost of Tsushima.

1116
01:39:52,671 --> 01:39:57,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Helldivers, that's just Starship Troopers.

1117
01:39:59,073 --> 01:40:01,234
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that this is just Starship Troopers, right?

1118
01:40:01,814 --> 01:40:08,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking a game that's based off of Starship Troopers and Terminator and then you're

1119
01:40:09,673 --> 01:40:10,054
[SPEAKER_03]: StarShipTroopers

1120
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:26,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll have to see.

1121
01:40:26,792 --> 01:40:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but then again, if you think about it, it's a whole other generation now, right?

1122
01:40:30,874 --> 01:40:31,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

1123
01:40:32,075 --> 01:40:35,377
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that won't even remember the original, which is a damn shame.

1124
01:40:35,898 --> 01:40:38,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it is what it is.

1125
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, is Paul Verhoeven still alive?

1126
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Can he just direct this movie instead?

1127
01:40:43,783 --> 01:40:45,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he's still making movies if he is.

1128
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:48,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that's too bad.

1129
01:40:49,026 --> 01:40:49,326
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1130
01:40:50,527 --> 01:40:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Last but not least, hey,

1131
01:40:53,203 --> 01:40:54,084
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1132
01:41:12,216 --> 01:41:27,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here for it and so I want to end our official news roll on this note tonight which is Shift Up which is a South Korean company and they made the PlayStation 5 exclusive action game Stellar Blade they have gifted all of their staff a PlayStation 5 Pro

1133
01:41:29,077 --> 01:41:33,680
[SPEAKER_05]: and given a cash bonus of 5 million won, which is around $3,400.

1134
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:36,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So to kind of put that in perspective.

1135
01:41:37,462 --> 01:41:40,804
[SPEAKER_05]: This was published in a publication in South Korea called Naver.

1136
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:48,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was a bonus that was put out there to encourage the company's staff, as bonuses tend to do.

1137
01:41:48,929 --> 01:41:51,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Shift Up has about 311 employees.

1138
01:41:52,312 --> 01:41:53,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Shift Up, of course, had a pretty good 2024.

1139
01:41:55,095 --> 01:41:57,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Stellar Blade did pretty well.

1140
01:41:58,017 --> 01:42:02,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Shift Up has also done crossover DLC with Nier Automata for this game.

1141
01:42:03,002 --> 01:42:06,905
[SPEAKER_05]: In July, the company raised around $320 million or $435 billion won after an initial public offering.

1142
01:42:11,989 --> 01:42:22,355
[SPEAKER_05]: In a comment, ShiftUp is saying that Stellar Blade's launch sales, quote, continued at a stabilized level, although we don't know exactly what that level looks like, but if we're seeing this, pretty good.

1143
01:42:22,635 --> 01:42:30,479
[SPEAKER_05]: We also know Stellar Blade is coming to PC in 2025, as a lot of the Sony titles are doing, and it expects to do pretty well there.

1144
01:42:32,136 --> 01:42:39,198
[SPEAKER_05]: More bonuses, more incentives, more credit to the hardworking people making these games, for sure.

1145
01:42:39,879 --> 01:42:43,320
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTC in chat says, I know Rob's been sour on the game industry last week.

1146
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't disagree, but it's always nice to hear stuff like this with some good news.

1147
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:47,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.

1148
01:42:48,021 --> 01:42:49,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be sour on the game industry.

1149
01:42:50,402 --> 01:43:13,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to be that guy that's sitting here just complaining about video games like why fucking podcast about video games if you just hate everything about it but like this last year it's been rough y'all so I'm liking this energy about some bonuses and it's a granted it's not in America but it's a start let's take that energy and manifest that for some of the developers in other countries as well all right with that

1150
01:43:14,616 --> 01:43:15,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to the Listener Roundtable.

1151
01:43:16,157 --> 01:43:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: We encourage you all to email us or you can also call in over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1152
01:43:23,361 --> 01:43:26,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we had any emails tonight.

1153
01:43:26,123 --> 01:43:27,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to log in and just double check.

1154
01:43:28,225 --> 01:43:29,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, if you want to participate...

1155
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:59,731
[SPEAKER_05]: you always can do that by sending us an email participate at orangeloungeradio.com although I know many of you just prefer to chat or use discord and that's fine too very few people seem to use emails anymore such as seems to be the case so alright we just have one spam email and I even put it in the trash so Jamie won't complain about it next week mark the word I finally moved an email to the trash alright

1156
01:44:01,816 --> 01:44:04,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, on that note, do you have any last minute stories for us?

1157
01:44:04,577 --> 01:44:07,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have one last thing I was going to mention.

1158
01:44:07,277 --> 01:44:18,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So this came out via the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit, but more details regarding the whole Genki and CES booth.

1159
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:23,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Nintendo was not happy with them being there and they actually sent lawyers to

1160
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:27,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this I will say this

1161
01:44:53,488 --> 01:44:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Kudos to them holding their ground.

1162
01:44:55,288 --> 01:44:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if they're going to be wrong, they're going to be big wrong.

1163
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:08,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I don't think I love what Genki's doing in this case, but I, like everybody else, also feel like this is literally the worst kept secret in gaming.

1164
01:45:09,474 --> 01:45:09,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And like...

1165
01:45:10,994 --> 01:45:40,209
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just getting annoying like we're just all rolling our eyes like come on Nintendo like just like I get it they couldn't say anything because the holiday they don't want to cannibalize sales not everybody follows the industry as close as the rest of us do but like it's and again this is why I'm sitting here going it really ought to be next week if it's not and we're looking at something closer to the end of March in their original commitment that's going to put this whole thing it's just it's just getting annoying but is that going to make me not buy one

1166
01:45:40,629 --> 01:45:40,849
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1167
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:44,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if it plays the old games better.

1168
01:45:44,951 --> 01:45:46,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I need, honestly.

1169
01:45:46,532 --> 01:45:56,456
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could replay Pokemon Legends better on a newer console, or not just that, Violet

1170
01:45:57,947 --> 01:45:59,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I remember the names of those games?

1171
01:45:59,629 --> 01:46:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1172
01:46:00,450 --> 01:46:01,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Scarlet Violet.

1173
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:02,993
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can play that, Gen 10, 9.

1174
01:46:04,014 --> 01:46:08,940
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can play Gen 9 better on a new Switch console, sign me the fuck up.

1175
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:10,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I need, to be honest.

1176
01:46:11,322 --> 01:46:11,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1177
01:46:12,932 --> 01:46:15,473
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1178
01:46:31,519 --> 01:46:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But Genki is profiting off of an unannounced Nintendo product, no matter which way you slice it.

1179
01:46:36,646 --> 01:46:41,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be the problem, which isn't quite the same thing as the Streisand effect, though I get what you're saying, of course.

1180
01:46:42,333 --> 01:46:47,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And SGO100 Matt, with the classic Schoolyard comeback of Dbrand started it, honestly.

1181
01:46:50,765 --> 01:47:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's also another... I mean, there's a lot of rumor and speculation when it comes to the Switch 2 right now, but apparently another leaker has... or an Apple leaker normally says that they've confirmed that the Switch 2 is on the black market in China right now.

1182
01:47:08,897 --> 01:47:11,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some development samples have gotten leaked out there.

1183
01:47:11,999 --> 01:47:14,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they picked it up that way?

1184
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1185
01:47:14,721 --> 01:47:15,741
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all a big mess.

1186
01:47:15,841 --> 01:47:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just wait and...

1187
01:47:17,625 --> 01:47:18,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait for them to announce it.

1188
01:47:18,686 --> 01:47:19,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just don't care at this point.

1189
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Just announce it.

1190
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:22,229
[SPEAKER_03]: We already kind of know what it is.

1191
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:22,990
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1192
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:25,192
[SPEAKER_05]: On the plausibility meter.

1193
01:47:25,332 --> 01:47:27,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get out the plausometer.

1194
01:47:27,454 --> 01:47:29,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like an applause meter, but it's plausibility.

1195
01:47:30,136 --> 01:47:33,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero meaning not fucking happening.

1196
01:47:33,339 --> 01:47:35,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no fucking way.

1197
01:47:35,641 --> 01:47:37,883
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be like, zero would be like

1198
01:47:39,795 --> 01:47:41,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but not happening, okay?

1199
01:47:41,716 --> 01:47:43,957
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 is absolutely happening.

1200
01:47:44,497 --> 01:47:48,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bet money is absolutely, okay, on the plausibility scale.

1201
01:47:48,959 --> 01:47:50,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Chad, I want to hear from you too.

1202
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Switch to revealed this week.

1203
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:53,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Plausibility scale.

1204
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Four.

1205
01:47:56,943 --> 01:47:57,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Four.

1206
01:47:57,183 --> 01:47:59,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good guess.

1207
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:02,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to agree with that.

1208
01:48:02,586 --> 01:48:03,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to copy your homework.

1209
01:48:03,546 --> 01:48:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say four.

1210
01:48:04,167 --> 01:48:04,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Four.

1211
01:48:05,051 --> 01:48:09,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's quite right in the middle, but I think it's... Maybe I would go a little higher.

1212
01:48:09,737 --> 01:48:10,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1213
01:48:10,338 --> 01:48:10,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go five.

1214
01:48:11,319 --> 01:48:11,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go five.

1215
01:48:12,521 --> 01:48:13,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be like a couple weeks.

1216
01:48:14,183 --> 01:48:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gonna be this month because you have to... Let's assume that they are putting out this financial quarter.

1217
01:48:24,124 --> 01:48:39,862
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to give some sort of lead time to for advertising and all that stuff like I get it that they want to play on their own timetable unless it is delayed to fall but either way like I feel that they need to announce something at this point

1218
01:48:41,495 --> 01:48:47,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, DarkTituya says 7 or 8, MikeDev says 7, OrangeRite says 6, SJ100Matt says 6.

1219
01:48:47,778 --> 01:48:49,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting, everybody in chat guessing higher than we did.

1220
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:50,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1221
01:48:50,619 --> 01:48:51,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we're just negative.

1222
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:55,141
[SPEAKER_05]: These years and years have made us negative, Loki.

1223
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:57,882
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster says, I'm going to say Cheesecake.

1224
01:48:58,662 --> 01:49:00,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, valid.

1225
01:49:02,423 --> 01:49:23,415
[SPEAKER_05]: on a scale of 1 to 10, Cheesecake is always the right answer, absolutely Orange Rite says, this month 8 and kind of along the same lines as what we've been saying, with all the leaks it's gotta be imminent Bobby Blackwolf says, I was Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I was gonna say Taco well if you say Taco, then you're saying it's getting announced Tuesday because it's Taco Tuesday

1226
01:49:24,315 --> 01:49:50,588
[SPEAKER_05]: so but then I well Tuesday would be kind of funny because you know two Nintendo Switch 2 it's Switch Tuesday I you know if it was Tuesday I feel like Nintendo makes that announcement today yesterday Friday I there is again a non-zero chance I would give this maybe a a one or a two on the plausibility meter that tomorrow morning we wake up to the announcement of the Direct

1227
01:49:52,785 --> 01:49:54,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's... But I don't think it'll be Tuesday.

1228
01:49:54,727 --> 01:49:59,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be... I think Thursday... Honestly, Thursday does seem like the most logical day for them to do it.

1229
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:05,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a non-zero chance we wake up tomorrow and it's a Thursday reveal.

1230
01:50:05,539 --> 01:50:08,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we could all be sitting here in seven days' time going...

1231
01:50:10,258 --> 01:50:19,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Put my clown dress on because honk honk, here I am, Boo Boo the Fool once again, getting fooled by Nintendo and not a goddamn thing happened this week again.

1232
01:50:19,929 --> 01:50:21,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's everything that we thought it was going to be.

1233
01:50:22,632 --> 01:50:24,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprise, it's fucking nothing.

1234
01:50:24,134 --> 01:50:26,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That Mario Kart 9, woo.

1235
01:50:26,577 --> 01:50:27,999
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so unexpected.

1236
01:50:28,854 --> 01:50:34,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wouldn't it actually be, I know everybody's saying Mario Kart 9, but I actually thought it's supposed to be Mario Kart 10.

1237
01:50:35,157 --> 01:50:37,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you consider the mobile game Mario Kart 9?

1238
01:50:37,398 --> 01:50:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: The leakers have already said 9, so we'll see.

1239
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be 9.

1240
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:40,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck the leakers.

1241
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:43,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about logic, reason, sense.

1242
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:53,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they're not going to give actual credence to Mario Kart World Circuit or whatever it is, but that's not a real game.

1243
01:50:53,825 --> 01:50:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mobile game.

1244
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:57,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Death says Mario Kart 8.2.

1245
01:50:58,101 --> 01:51:00,082
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite name, Mario Kart 8.2.

1246
01:51:01,523 --> 01:51:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: 8.2 is the Switch version.

1247
01:51:02,943 --> 01:51:03,784
[SPEAKER_05]: 8.2, Infinity Lab.

1248
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:06,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then Mario Kart 8.3.

1249
01:51:07,906 --> 01:51:13,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Bobby Blackwolf with the really cool reboot suggestion going, it's just going to be simply Mario Kart.

1250
01:51:13,928 --> 01:51:16,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even Super Mario Kart on your Super Switch?

1251
01:51:20,091 --> 01:51:21,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Super Switch is the name, Loki?

1252
01:51:21,612 --> 01:51:21,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1253
01:51:22,628 --> 01:51:23,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart 2.

1254
01:51:23,149 --> 01:51:25,611
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the name of the system.

1255
01:51:25,671 --> 01:51:26,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's Super Switch?

1256
01:51:27,553 --> 01:51:27,714
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1257
01:51:28,074 --> 01:51:28,695
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't either.

1258
01:51:29,275 --> 01:51:30,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a cute title.

1259
01:51:30,597 --> 01:51:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Super was the age of the 90s.

1260
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is super anymore.

1261
01:51:35,475 --> 01:51:36,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Switch 2 is good enough.

1262
01:52:08,032 --> 01:52:10,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up for tonight.

1263
01:52:10,854 --> 01:52:14,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with our show.

1265
01:52:16,439 --> 01:52:21,183

[SPEAKER_05]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or YouTube, wherever it is that you found this show.

1269
01:52:34,614 --> 01:52:51,569
[SPEAKER_05]: switch announcement or not to do this all over again either we're going to come in with our clown nose I think I have a clown nose somewhere and maybe if they don't announcement I don't want to commit to it because I might not be able to find my clown nose but if I can and they don't announcement I'll come in with my clown nose on and go honk honk I got played the fool again we'll see all right um

1270
01:52:52,873 --> 01:52:54,133

[SPEAKER_05]: Seven days we'll be doing that and back again.

1272
01:52:56,714 --> 01:52:58,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully DarkSakura is back with us this week.

1273
01:52:58,175 --> 01:52:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why she won't be.

1274
01:52:59,435 --> 01:53:00,176
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have that.

1275
01:53:01,096 --> 01:53:02,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very, very excited.

1276
01:53:02,656 --> 01:53:06,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So Bobby Blackwell says, just pick up a clown nose at Party City.

1277
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:06,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.

1278
01:53:07,558 --> 01:53:09,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guess which store I went by today.

1279
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:12,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually went out on Ingress today because it's called Second Sunday in Ingress.

1280
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:18,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did a mission banner downtown and I got to walk right by the downtown Macy's, which guess what?

1281
01:53:19,465 --> 01:53:19,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Closing.

1282
01:53:20,285 --> 01:53:21,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything must go.

1283
01:53:21,146 --> 01:53:21,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1284
01:53:21,526 --> 01:53:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: All the signs are up.

1285
01:53:22,507 --> 01:53:24,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the one local here.

1286
01:53:24,748 --> 01:53:25,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1287
01:53:25,168 --> 01:53:25,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them.

1288
01:53:25,908 --> 01:53:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1289
01:53:27,009 --> 01:53:31,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... Well, I think... That mall has almost no anchors left.

1290
01:53:31,531 --> 01:53:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Macy's in general, because they're opening a new one in Elk Grove, but it's going to look like a Marshall's or a TJ Maxx.

1291
01:53:38,855 --> 01:53:40,316
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where Macy's is headed now.

1292
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:43,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be that size and not like a giant mall tenant.

1293
01:53:43,297 --> 01:53:46,139
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to look more like a home goods, that type of store.

1294
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:47,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

1295
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:47,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Was...

1296
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:51,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Penny's the one that had Toys R Us or is that Macy's?

1297
01:53:51,501 --> 01:53:52,041
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Macy's.

1298
01:53:53,782 --> 01:53:55,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Penny's has Sephora and some other stuff.

1299
01:53:56,603 --> 01:53:56,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Meh.

1300
01:53:58,764 --> 01:54:00,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, final thoughts.

1301
01:54:00,385 --> 01:54:00,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do them.

1302
01:54:00,865 --> 01:54:01,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

1303
01:54:04,286 --> 01:54:05,287
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be busy this week.

1304
01:54:06,187 --> 01:54:08,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1305
01:54:09,101 --> 01:54:23,780
[SPEAKER_05]: my final thought two parts number one happy birthday Dark Tetsuya you've been with the show from the very beginning so kudos to you happy birthday hope you and Mish had a great time celebrating that's my number one final thought my number two final thought is

1306

[SPEAKER_05]: I had a thought and I lost it.

1307
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:30,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was going to say thank you very much everybody for all the kind words about Mr. Smush.

1308
01:54:30,443 --> 01:54:32,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate that and I'll send that along to Alan.

1309
01:54:32,883 --> 01:54:42,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a kitty or even a puppy or whatever animal you have of choice that will take a hug from a human, please hug your pets extra tight for me.

1310
01:54:42,286 --> 01:54:42,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1311
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:44,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to take the line from Bob Barker as well.

1312
01:54:44,846 --> 01:54:46,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget to have your pets spayed and neutered.

1313
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:47,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Help control the pet population.

1314
01:54:48,347 --> 01:54:50,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, have a good night everybody.
