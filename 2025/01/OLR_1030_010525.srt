1
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new year, what else is new?

2
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:13,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a new Minecraft not made under Microsoft's stewardship?

3
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:20,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it can't be called that since Notch doesn't own the name, and I doubt Microsoft will license it to someone else's work, but that link is inextricably present for him.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:25,296
[SPEAKER_06]: His next game is already being referred to as Minecraft 2, and his own tweets are not dissuading the connection either.

5
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:28,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy New Year!

6
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about maybe new Minecraft and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:46,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:55,980
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with you all once again tonight, episode number 1030 of our show for tonight, January the 5th of 2025.

11
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:58,202
[SPEAKER_08]: You can believe it?

12
00:00:58,622 --> 00:00:59,063
[SPEAKER_08]: New year.

13
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,203
[SPEAKER_08]: New year, new me?

14
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:01,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, not here at OLR.

15
00:01:02,044 --> 00:01:04,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Same show you've come to expect.

16
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:10,488
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're back to talk a little bit about what we hope to expect this year, and of course some of the gaming headlines.

17
00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:16,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here, Rob Roberts, joined as always by the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

18
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:17,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

19
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, hello.

20
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:18,932
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing?

21
00:01:20,052 --> 00:01:20,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay.

22
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:21,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have a good New Year's?

23
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:23,734
[SPEAKER_01]: It was alright.

24
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:24,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

25
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:25,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine was very quiet.

26
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:25,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.

27
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:34,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia came over and we drank and yeah, that was about it.

28
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:37,553
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ended up having a pretty quiet night.

30
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:10,272
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

31
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:14,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Staying up and playing video games all night is a perfectly acceptable plan for New Year's.

32
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that was the plan for Techmaster Loki.

33
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:17,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Loki.

34
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of, but I don't think we really did much.

35
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:25,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Watched TV.

36
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: You just watched TV?

37
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:28,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

38
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:41,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you at that age where the kids kind of go to bed before or are you the kids at that age where they go to bed before midnight and you do like a nine o'clock East Coast thing or do they stay up at this point?

39
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,297
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they stay up.

40
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:52,240
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been going to the in-laws to go hang out and stay up over there.

41
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:56,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Although my oldest this time, he's like, no, I don't want to do that.

42
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna play games here.

43
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:13,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure many gamers have seen that classic uh comic meme it's in like three panels and it's like gamer new years and it says 11 59 the person's gaming 12 o'clock and they're holding up a firework and then 1201 they're back to gaming I really feel it so that's that's basically where your kid is at now

44
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:15,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's basically where he's at.

45
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

46
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,907
[SPEAKER_08]: He's with the rest of us, it sounds like.

47
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So, good times.

48
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:20,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

49
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:25,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I hope all of you out there had a great New Year, whatever you were doing to celebrate.

50
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:31,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So, to start off the New Year here at Orange Launch Radio, I thought we would take a look back.

51
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:32,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all love this.

52
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:38,336
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go back and take a look at our 2024 predictions.

53
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:41,358
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to see what came true and what didn't.

54
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:51,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, because we're gluttons for punishment, we're going to make our 2025 predictions, which I will fully admit, I forgot to think about before tonight's show.

55
00:03:51,104 --> 00:03:52,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to think of them as we go.

56
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:53,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Even after you reminded us.

57
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

58
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Even after I said a reminder to everybody else, we're doing predictions tonight.

59
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:58,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I went out on a walk and I was like, yeah.

60
00:03:58,669 --> 00:03:59,169
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare.

61
00:03:59,530 --> 00:03:59,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

62
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:00,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

63
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,751
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

64
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of thought about it.

65
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is where you all in chat help us.

66
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:17,810
[SPEAKER_08]: You can give us inspiration because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific on Sunday nights right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

67
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't care if there's some silly award show on TV.

68
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:22,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here.

69
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So check us out, which I believe is the case tonight.

70
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,214
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a silly award show on TV, but it doesn't matter.

71
00:04:28,294 --> 00:04:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still going to be doing our thing, of course.

72
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk about predictions.

73
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:31,815
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

74
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's ready to revisit 2024?

75
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's afraid to revisit 2024?

76
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:38,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

77
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:39,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

78
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Do any of you think you got any right?

79
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember what I said.

80
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:09,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it?

81
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:10,862
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

82
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:12,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It did not.

83
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:15,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so there's a first song.

84
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:18,404
[SPEAKER_08]: So you had a Kickstarter that did not release on Steam.

85
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:18,704
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

86
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:32,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, your first one was Bobby Kotek becomes the CEO of a different gaming or gaming adjacent company, which looks to be incorrect.

87
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank heavens.

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be thankful, Matt.

89
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:37,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's...

90
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:40,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's good they didn't.

91
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be thankful on that one.

92
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:42,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think we're all relieved.

93
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:51,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Then my first prediction was two launch window titles for the Switch successor are Microsoft games, and one of them is Sea of Thieves.

94
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

95
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:56,918
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't fucking get the Switch 2 this year, so that's a big eh there.

96
00:05:56,978 --> 00:06:02,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, that simple little fact really fucked a few of our predictions.

97
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I think many of us were expecting the Switch 2 this year.

98
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:06,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't happen.

99
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:12,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that, you know, I could literally copy-paste that into next year's predictions.

100
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,410
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to do that, I don't think.

101
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,534
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I still feel like that one may hold some weight just a few months late.

102
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:20,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um...

103
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:29,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, your second prediction was E3 announces another metamorphosis, which I don't believe is correct either.

104
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:34,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe E3 really... It metamorphosized into jack shit.

105
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:40,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It metamorphosized into six feet underground, so E3's... So I was right.

106
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that.

107
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

108
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

109
00:06:45,270 --> 00:07:12,234
[SPEAKER_08]: judges bong okay uh metamorphosized into deceased metamorphosized into death all right uh Matt your second one was death is a metamorphosis all right uh oh here we go oh this is the minute these words leave my mouth they're gonna be like big x the switch successor is announced by March wrong year you know what you didn't say the year that's true I did not say the year

110
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least if you did, I didn't write it down.

111
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:20,773
[SPEAKER_08]: You said Switch successor announced by March, Prime 4.

112
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So you said Prime 4, which is an easy one to call, let's be real.

113
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And Odyssey, I'm guessing a sequel to Odyssey or something, releases 2025.

114
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:31,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, that was it.

115
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:33,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So you said that Odyssey would be a game for 2025.

116
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:38,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, this feels like one of those, like,

117
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:47,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I'm going to keep this file open because I feel like we might want to revisit some of these and just see where the vibes were delayed a little bit.

118
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Just off by a year, it's fine.

119
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:53,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just off a little bit, that's all.

120
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:57,449
[SPEAKER_08]: My second prediction, I'm not sure if this happened or not.

121
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might have, but here we go.

122
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:08,237
[SPEAKER_08]: A AAA game gets exposed for way overuse of AI and it causes the game to absolutely tank.

123
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:14,562
[SPEAKER_08]: and my question is did that quadruple A game did that get caught using AI?

124
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:16,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?

125
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,746
[SPEAKER_08]: The quadruple A game that Ubisoft put out.

126
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:20,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Star Wars?

127
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:21,587
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

128
00:08:21,947 --> 00:08:25,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that pirate game that they put out that they were saying was a quadruple A title?

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,551
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it had AI.

130
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:29,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just terrible.

131
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:30,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

132
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought I might have that one.

133
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,575
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't AI.

134
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:35,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Um

135
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's intentionally wrong on purpose.

136
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:21,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, yeah, I don't think I would give myself credit for this one, because in my mind, I'm just gonna be honest, in my mind, I was envisioning that there would be a whole, like, cancellation on social media, where, look at this, we've determined that, like, kind of what happened to Palworld and Pokemon, where, like, somebody goes in and...

137
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:24,303
[SPEAKER_08]: and OrangeRite in chat says FoamStars had the AI.

138
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they did, but that actually wasn't a 2024 game either.

139
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:28,706
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew about that one already.

140
00:09:29,226 --> 00:09:31,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And that wasn't the reason it failed.

141
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:36,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, that game did... I think they got rid of their...

142
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:58,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know it was going multiple platforms I know Foam Stars was like evolving they're not shutting it down but it's like here's our last hurrah basically happening on the Foam Stars front which again I remember I played that game on stream because Shane bullied me into doing it and actually it really wasn't that bad the AI art aside which was bad but they realized that mistake real quick for what it's worth

143
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:18,264
[SPEAKER_08]: alright so let's go to the last predictions which were from Jamie said bigger push in VR and spatial environments in and outside the gaming industry this was kind of muddy to me I don't know Jamie what do you think be on your honor did you get this one

144
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,231
[SPEAKER_03]: There were pushes.

145
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There definitely were pushes.

146
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:23,332
[SPEAKER_03]: There were also setbacks.

147
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:24,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

148
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:25,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things I cannot discuss.

149
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:26,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

150
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:26,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

151
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:27,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.

152
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:35,416
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that it stayed fairly steady with new games coming out.

153
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it was more of a slow progression.

154
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:37,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: and definitely there was experimentation done in the world of virtual environments.

156
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:57,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are still a lot of AR tools out there too, like the image scan, you know, taking the picture, converting it to 3D using AI.

157
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's still those tools out there.

158
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:07,895
[SPEAKER_03]: There's FaceSwap, I think got an update, not FaceSwap, but the 3D face mapping software.

159
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:11,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a big update.

160
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:15,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think on a technical level, yes.

161
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, for every step forward, you've got steps backwards.

162
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:20,605
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

163
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:44,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and you know, I am thinking about there was a story that I had on our shortlist that I ended up not putting in tonight, but it had to do with Steam stats and I think part of I had a hard time following in the story where they were getting the stats from, but it was talking about how the Oculus or VR in general on Steam has been growing, but it's not because of the US is because of China.

164
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,323
[SPEAKER_08]: that VR usage has really been growing.

165
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:59,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's kind of one of those things that, you know, for all the prediction and all the talk on VR and where's it going to go, what's it going to do, I think that's one of the things that has not really been in the immediate vision.

166
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:02,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like, oh, yeah, that's a big factor.

167
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is China.

168
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:10,999
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens in other large markets with VR and how might that influence what happens on the world scale?

169
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,081
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought that was interesting.

170
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:17,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, was it really what you were envisioning at the start of 2024?

171
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:17,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not.

172
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,363
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not far off.

173
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,444
[SPEAKER_08]: But VR is not dead.

174
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,184
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's an important part of it.

175
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:34,987
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other applications that are... How am I trying to phrase this?

176
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,407
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other applications being discovered.

177
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:42,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not going to happen as quickly as I would have hoped.

178
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:51,870
[SPEAKER_03]: For some of that, I think that it's more of the market's not ready for what is possible.

179
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:58,114
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what comes to mind that I do think qualifies under this, actually?

180
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know I follow a lot of Niantic stuff.

181
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:04,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did have a big story a couple weeks ago, or actually a couple months ago.

182
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:09,722
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also launched this tool, you know, they had bought this thing called Scanniverse.

183
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:10,742
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

184
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,451
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

185
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,574
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:31,028
[SPEAKER_08]: is that that yes that is a big push from Niantic to get into spatial environments especially outside the gaming industry really trying to look at predictive what is happening in the world what is happening you know beyond just what you see in games so just a thought that kind of like just went off in my mind as we were talking that that was a big big story from a

187
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:51,708
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are already other attempts though just for standard like I know Google Street View was doing like museum walks and things like that not quite of course the same thing but I could certainly see how

188
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:05,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That augmented reality and 3D scanning and building virtual environments may replace things that are normally camera-based.

189
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:12,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I will say the scans that you get out of the scan... Because I've messed around with the Scannerverse application, and it's really good.

190
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:15,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And the scans you get out of it look really incredible.

191
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:18,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually trying to see if there's something on stream I can actually show.

192
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to dox myself, so I'm picking something...

193
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:43,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So, kind of neat.

195
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:26,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on to Loki I'm gonna have to check this out, it looks pretty cool Oh yeah, the Scannaverse thing's cool Anyway, so Loki, this may be, you may have got this one I think I would give you a point for this one, you ready?

196
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:37,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is, your last prediction was The Minecraft movie trailer sucks Congratulations, you got it At least that first preview did

197
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,442
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one, yes.

198
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:44,824
[SPEAKER_08]: The second one... It got better, but the first preview was pretty bad.

199
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,205
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright.

200
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I would give you that one.

201
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:49,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I would give you that one.

202
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, oh man, my last one.

203
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:55,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all are going to scream.

204
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:58,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so close, but I didn't get it.

205
00:16:58,066 --> 00:16:58,486
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?

206
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:06,592
[SPEAKER_08]: My last prediction was the game of the year 2024 at the Game Awards is an indie game.

207
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was so close.

208
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:17,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there was one, Bellatro was definitely in conversation and was at a lot of the front of people's minds.

209
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was plausible.

210
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:27,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give myself the plausible participation trophy on that one because it was really darn close.

211
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:30,635
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we know, Astro Bot actually won the award.

212
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's that.

213
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

214
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:41,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we ready to – so when all is said and done, it's like one and a half.

215
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:43,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, everybody.

216
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:44,843
[SPEAKER_08]: One and a half.

217
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:50,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Curse Nintendo for not releasing.

218
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:50,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang it, Nintendo.

219
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:51,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

220
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:52,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Ruin everything.

221
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now we're going to get into 2025.

222
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:05,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I want to encourage all of you in chat to play along if you have some good predictions you want to throw your hat in the ring this year.

223
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:10,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's look at our 2025 predictions.

224
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I'll start with you.

225
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,090
[SPEAKER_08]: You have something you want to mention.

226
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:23,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, my first one is going to be, Ikea has a collaboration with a major gaming company.

227
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: They are collaborating more.

228
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:52,356
[SPEAKER_03]: um uh and this actually come from me looking for uh furniture for myself and finally they had a whole gaming series and I had a partnership with Lego and uh Republic of Gaming and like all kinds of things and I was like oh there's gonna be an official collaboration before too long so

229
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw that out there.

230
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:57,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikea has a collaboration with a major gaming company.

231
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:02,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when you think about things like Minecraft would be such an obvious one, right?

232
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:08,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Or those types of world building sorts of things that are very adjacent to Lego, right?

233
00:19:09,124 --> 00:19:10,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see, we'll see.

234
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,026
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, what do you want to go with for your first one?

235
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is going to give you the mindset of where I'm at this year.

236
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:23,707
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skibbity Toilet movie shocks all in its absolute cinema.

237
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,510
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

238
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:29,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolute cinema.

239
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the fuck that has to do with gaming, Loki, but fine.

240
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the Half-Life assets in it, therefore it's gaming.

241
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:42,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And technically it's in Fortnite, so it is gaming now.

242
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:43,768
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fine.

243
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:46,191
[SPEAKER_08]: The Skivity Toilet movie shocks cinema.

244
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:50,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we talking like it's, I don't know, what's the movie they're talking about for Oscars this year?

245
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:51,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Wicked?

246
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:52,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Wicked Part 1 good?

247
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,966
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Wicked Part 1 good, but it's definitely Megalopolis.

248
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:02,527
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than that, which was Absolute Cinema, so you know.

249
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

250
00:20:06,328 --> 00:20:16,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go with my first prediction, and I'm going to say Nintendo shocks all by having enough Switch 2 stock.

251
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're going to avoid a Nintendo shortage.

252
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:22,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be bold on this one.

253
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:29,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there has been so much lead time towards this console and we see so much is getting out early about it.

254
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Nintendo is going to shock everybody by having enough Switch 2 stock.

255
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:38,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there'll be a lot of people ordering online and things like that.

256
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:39,642
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of that stuff.

257
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:43,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're going to have relatively enough Switch 2 stock.

258
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:45,443
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll...

259
00:20:46,443 --> 00:21:10,580
[SPEAKER_08]: it'll still be maybe a little bit I don't think we're going to see the shortages we've seen with any other platform in quite some time so we'll see though I could be wrong but that's you know I'm willing to put some predictions out there that are that are risky so there you go that's my first one all right Jamie we're over to you for number two Ubisoft is put up for sale oh you're really adjacent to something I want to say I'm still going to say it

260
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,603
[SPEAKER_08]: GreatMindsThink

261
00:21:41,013 --> 00:22:01,091
[SPEAKER_08]: think like that well I stole that from Becky oh okay well fine great minds think like us all right and who thinks like us huh damn few right well I thought that was the rest all right that's that's that's a who's like us that's like a different thing all right all right uh Loki what's your number two prediction

262
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: My number two prediction is that Microsoft will announce a portable console this year.

263
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:17,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And by portable console, I mean a handheld PC device, kind of like a Steam Deck, that is meant for their cloud streaming.

264
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:24,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I think that's an extremely safe prediction in some ways.

265
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:33,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, we don't know if it'll happen this year, but I feel like, yeah, I think there's a lot of tea leaves that are showing that Microsoft's going to go that direction for sure.

266
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it makes sense.

267
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:41,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that brings me to my next prediction, which I said it was going to be really close to what Jamie said.

268
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yves Gamont defeated.

269
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:45,920
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

270
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:17,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Last prediction.

271
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:30,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think how to phrase this because I think that TikTok is going to become a subsidy of its original parent company and be licensed to Twitch.

272
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So that it can continue operating in the US.

273
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:39,094
[SPEAKER_08]: That would mean Amazon buys TikTok, essentially.

274
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:40,775
[SPEAKER_04]: They wouldn't be buying.

275
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:43,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, licensed.

276
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:45,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

277
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:50,050
[SPEAKER_08]: This whole TikTok thing is going to be very interesting to see how that turns out.

278
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:54,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a chunk of the economy affected.

279
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:55,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't

280
00:23:58,448 --> 00:23:59,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I could go on a whole thing on this.

281
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:01,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I watch a lot of TikTok.

282
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,170
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much.

283
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

284
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I finally fell down that rabbit hole of TikTok hard.

285
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Like three years ago, I would have been that.

286
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:09,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know I've been that guy saying, what's a tech tech?

287
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:10,935
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that type of thing.

288
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:13,596
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, I don't know what it was in the last couple of years.

289
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I fell down TikTok hard.

290
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:17,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I went viral on TikTok this year for the first time.

291
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:17,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember?

292
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,659
[SPEAKER_08]: My one went viral.

293
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Got like 100,000 likes or whatever.

294
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

295
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:28,084
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, and I haven't made a TikTok since because the bar of expectation is too great now.

296
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:30,825
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm shocked.

297
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:33,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think we were the country that shut things down.

298
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think we were the country that censored things.

299
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:40,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And I understand people are saying there's a risk, there's a real risk.

300
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,593
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to be more transparent about what that risk is because do we trust the government?

301
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:48,534
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we sure don't.

302
00:24:49,014 --> 00:24:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't trust other people in this country because look who they elected.

303
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:52,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

304
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't care if it's Democrats or Republicans leading this.

305
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't trust any of them right now, to be quite honest.

306
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:07,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So why be surprised though about censorship in this country when our entire country was founded off of puritanical and extremist religious belief?

307
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:17,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, no, I just, I thought at the end of the day we would be better than that, and here we are.

308
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It's disappointing.

309
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I can be disappointed and still not be surprised.

310
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to explain that elsewhere.

311
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:23,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

312
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:26,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I can be not surprised, but still be disappointed.

313
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:32,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention, though, I mean, I could also, I was either gonna say that, or I had another...

314
00:25:36,232 --> 00:25:47,588
[SPEAKER_03]: a mention that I could have done instead but it would have had me going a lot more ranty and a lot more political because I was going to say that the gaming industry tanks due to policy changes but

315
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if the... Someone wants to steal that one.

316
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:53,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll see.

317
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:56,715
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S says the TikTok risk is there.

318
00:25:56,795 --> 00:26:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been there for years, but no one listens to IT people when it comes to applications or security risks.

319
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:04,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, be more transparent and specific.

320
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,021
[SPEAKER_08]: What are those risks?

321
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:09,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Because... They've been outlined before.

322
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:11,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, all I'm hearing is that China has your data.

323
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:12,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what?

324
00:26:13,745 --> 00:26:15,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't fucking trust Elon Musk with my data.

325
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does he get special treatment?

326
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:21,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of people I don't trust with my data, but somehow seems to get it anyway.

327
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:33,358
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm talking, and I get that IT professionals are saying these things, but again, I don't see what the risk is that we are already giving to other companies I don't trust.

328
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:43,939
[SPEAKER_03]: The concern has to do with access by Chinese government, because since Chinese government pretty much has their fingers in every company and industry, there is that.

329
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:46,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And the app does gather data, gathers lots of personal data.

330
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:58,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese national security laws basically say that any foreign and domestic firms that operate within their country must share their data with the government upon request.

331
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:23,426
[SPEAKER_03]: and especially given trade agreements and now these new sanctions coming up that's going to cause a pretty big conflict and as far as what basically the Chinese government is going to have access to for standard usage in America personal data uh purchasing history I mean because there's the TikTok shop and everything um they say that they store their data in the U.S.

332
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:35,602
[SPEAKER_03]: but they did also acknowledge that some non-US employees have access to US user data and there was also that BuzzFeed leak that uh

333
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a company called ByteDance has access to things like phone numbers, birthdays of American TikTok users so it's quite a that's just over the top

334
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:57,202
[SPEAKER_03]: part of it.

335
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I had to remember what the company was.

336
00:28:00,224 --> 00:28:12,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I don't know what has to be done, but if TikTok is banned, then I immediately want to see at least a ballot initiative in this state started to ban X. Why should X be allowed to operate?

337
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:15,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Elon Musk is trying to put his fingers in so many international pies.

338
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,415
[SPEAKER_08]: He's trying to influence German elections.

339
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:19,316
[SPEAKER_08]: He's trying to influence now what's happening in the UK.

340
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:19,897
[SPEAKER_08]: He's telling them to...

341
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:47,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Disassembled Parliament or whatever the fuck he's doing like that individual is more actively dangerous in so many ways so I just I do not understand why X is allowed to operate the way it is but TikTok isn't and the other the other thing too is that what someone might think is innocent data being acquired by another company any data any information is power yeah

342
00:28:48,843 --> 00:29:00,216
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can use it to track trends, to track commercial viability, to track communication standards, to test other security measures.

343
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:09,407
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot involved in the technology behind data gathering like that that the average person doesn't think about.

344
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:26,441
[SPEAKER_03]: and so it's a matter of okay well I don't care about my stuff but you're only thinking about yourself right there you're not thinking about the big picture at the same time I don't want to see it banned you know

345
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're all about the free market or whatever, then be very transparent with that information.

346
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:33,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the free market decide or whatever.

347
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:43,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do think, and I just, you know, the one other vent I want to get off my chest is that this is that, you know, and I'm sorry to get political, but I have to.

348
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:52,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The way, like, for Democrats to not be much more transparent in their messaging about why they're pushing so fucking hard for a TikTok ban.

349
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:56,017
[SPEAKER_08]: and now Trump is looking like he's coming in as a superhero.

350
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm the one that doesn't want to ban TikTok.

351
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:58,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to put a stop to it.

352
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:01,439
[SPEAKER_08]: This is terrible, terrible messaging.

353
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,681
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why Democrats are losing elections.

354
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:14,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Democrats are looking like the bad guys in this TikTok shutdown because they're not being more transparent or at least they are failing in their ability to message the why this is so important.

355
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:19,269
[SPEAKER_08]: They are absolutely failing in that messaging and this is something and you all know how I feel about the man.

356
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,950
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that Trump is doing a much better job on.

357
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:50,645
[SPEAKER_08]: and I can't stand that I'm saying this but it's true it's all about and if the last election has taught us anything it is and here's how I tie it back to the game industry facts don't fucking matter perception does no one cares about facts and just to point this out here anything you present as fact that is unsubstantiated is really an opinion

358
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:53,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And SSJ100Matt, exactly.

359
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,679
[SPEAKER_08]: He was pushing for TikTok to be banned in the beginning.

360
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,620
[SPEAKER_08]: That is absolutely 100% verifiably accurate.

361
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,001
[SPEAKER_08]: But the truth doesn't matter.

362
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Also accurate.

363
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in this case, some advisor sat him down and gave him a talking to.

364
00:31:09,044 --> 00:31:10,144
[SPEAKER_03]: A grown-up talking to.

365
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:13,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, all right.

366
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:14,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough of the TikToks.

367
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:15,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgusting.

368
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:17,435
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously... But anyway, that's my prediction.

369
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:18,095
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah, fair.

370
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:19,176
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is literally two weeks away.

371
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:19,756
[SPEAKER_03]: They find a way around it.

372
00:31:19,876 --> 00:31:20,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally two weeks away.

373
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:22,218
[SPEAKER_08]: We may not have TikTok in two weeks.

374
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:29,364
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's talks about VPN and other ways, but it's, you know, for the most part, it's quite... Let's be real.

375
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:32,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people aren't going to bother with all that shit for TikTok.

376
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:33,347
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's too bad.

377
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:34,828
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

378
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to gaming predictions.

379
00:31:38,766 --> 00:32:07,666
[SPEAKER_08]: but TikTok's huge for gaming so you know uh Loki I finally got invited to TikTok live and I'm like hell a little late don't you I think my one my one thing that went viral I think you just have to get so many views and eventually it happens so all right uh Loki your last prediction um I guess I mean that's more of a safe prediction I guess um

380
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:14,072
[SPEAKER_05]: The US tariffs drive console prices up another $100.

381
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:25,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so due to tariff laws, console prices go up $100.

382
00:32:27,506 --> 00:32:29,948
[SPEAKER_08]: That's essentially what you're saying, right?

383
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:31,350
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's just that.

384
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's... Could be closer to $200.

385
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,158
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not even saying that for consoles.

386
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:41,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying every piece of gaming software hardware goes up in price.

387
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,420
[SPEAKER_08]: SG100Matt says, I would have expected a Grand Theft Auto 6 prediction from Loki.

388
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, I don't care at this point.

389
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they've taken too long to announce their stuff.

390
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Their trailer came out over a year ago.

391
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:54,442
[SPEAKER_05]: They had time to do it.

392
00:32:54,902 --> 00:32:59,604
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do it when they're ready to announce their thing.

393
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:00,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

394
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:01,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait.

395
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:18,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my last prediction is going to be very similar to what I said last year, but I am going to change it and I am going to say no Microsoft AAA title is exclusive to Windows Xbox.

396
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:23,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Meaning they're going to release them on Switch or they're going to release them on PlayStation.

397
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:27,767
[SPEAKER_08]: No Microsoft AAA title ends up actually being exclusive to Microsoft.

398
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the prediction I'm making.

399
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:31,749
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I think that's one of the things we've seen.

400
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:34,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things kind of indicating that direction could be.

401
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:35,872
[SPEAKER_08]: be happening and what have you.

402
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:43,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there are other ways Microsoft will try to drive people to their ecosystems, such as like the best version of their game or what have you.

403
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:50,480
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think Microsoft, so I'm sort of leaning into what I said last year about the Switch successor and Microsoft having launched titles on that.

404
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:58,384
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's still going to be true, but I'm going to just add to it that no Microsoft AAA title is actually exclusive to Windows and Xbox.

405
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:03,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're going to see a ton of them on Nintendo, and I think where it matters, they're going to show up on PlayStation as well.

406
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:06,649
[SPEAKER_08]: That is my last prediction.

407
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:07,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's recap.

408
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are our 2025 predictions.

409
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:12,796
[SPEAKER_08]: IKEA, major collaboration with a major gaming company.

410
00:34:13,416 --> 00:34:15,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Skibbity Toilet Movie, Shock Cinema.

411
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:23,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo, I guess I need to add to that by being good because otherwise that's too much room for interpretation when we come back to this.

412
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo shocks all by having enough Switch 2 stock.

413
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft is put up for sale.

414
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:33,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft announces portable console, handheld PC device meant for cloud streaming.

415
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:34,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yves Guillemot defeated.

416
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,269
[SPEAKER_08]: TikTok subsidy of parent company licensed to Twitch.

417
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:40,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I really like that one.

418
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:41,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that actually is true.

419
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:42,017
[SPEAKER_08]: U.S.

420
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:49,841
[SPEAKER_08]: tariffs up console prices $100 and no Microsoft AAA title is exclusive to Windows or Xbox.

421
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Put them in the vault, lock them down.

422
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,345
[SPEAKER_08]: There they are, your 2025 predictions.

423
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:57,946
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's talk.

424
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of you were asking last week,

425
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:06,861
[SPEAKER_08]: What might the OLR hosts game of the year for this year actually look like?

426
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to invite my co-hosts and I'll share as well.

427
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:14,409
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your games of the year?

428
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:15,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start.

429
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,392
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to Matt with this one to start off.

430
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:18,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, what's your 2024 game of the year?

431
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,981
[SPEAKER_05]: My game of the year?

432
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:24,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I have multiple games, I guess.

433
00:35:25,046 --> 00:35:25,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

434
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:29,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Minecraft still, obviously, still playing that.

435
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:37,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the two other ones that stood out for me the most would have been Bull Altru.

436
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:40,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's been a really great game.

437
00:35:41,325 --> 00:36:04,873
[SPEAKER_05]: um a lot of fun to play and then one like I just couldn't stop talking about when I was playing it that came out the beginning of the year um would have to be oh gosh and then now of course it disappears out of my brain um it would have to be oh god I forgot the name of it uh

438
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:06,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

439
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:08,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come back to me.

440
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:09,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Left Elastic Impression.

441
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:10,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

442
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,265
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just my old brain being that way.

443
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:19,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Turbo Kid

444
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:47,674
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what was your game of the year?

445
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say Dragon Age, Veilguard.

446
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:13,578
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a lot of stuff I don't really care about it, you know, that I think could have been a lot better, but I've had a lot of fucking fun playing it.

447
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:22,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I've of course played so much Dead by Daylight, it's always being updated, so I'm going to include the Debbies.

448
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:27,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And... Yeah.

449
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be...

450
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Be my two.

451
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:34,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

452
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:42,881
[SPEAKER_08]: My game of the year, I kind of went a little bit of a different direction just because I think there are games I could have named my game of the year.

453
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,082
[SPEAKER_08]: There's things that I've really enjoyed.

454
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:48,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Diablo 4's expansion really put the game in a great place.

455
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, I've sunk a lot of hours into that game.

456
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:54,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you could say the Warcraft expansion was pretty good too.

457
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly a lot of people have enjoyed Final Fantasy Rebirth.

458
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:04,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I could say Bellatro, but the reality is I did not click with that game I think the way everybody else did.

459
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:06,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Just different strokes for different folks.

460
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that it's doing so great.

461
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:11,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that it's bringing some indie attention and all that stuff.

462
00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:16,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just have to say, I wouldn't feel right saying, oh, that's my favorite game of the year.

463
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:39,258
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you know I was talking about last week I think if I really really like had to pick one thing I would probably say you know that Pokemon trading card pocket game is so smart I think in many ways it ought to be recognized for just like what a strong and kind of unique sort of release it is to bring a lot of attention to mobile gaming but I

464
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:51,003
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual thing I want to say for my game of the year because the thing I actually thought about was, you know, kind of everything that we've kind of dealt with in 2024 when it comes to, you know, we've had so many layoffs in the industry.

465
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:54,466
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen so much BS that's been going on behind the scenes.

466
00:38:54,506 --> 00:39:01,353
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen so many, you know, rich people getting richer and people on the front lines that are working hard on these games getting laid off.

467
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:16,905
[SPEAKER_08]: and we've seen, you know, a lot of teases for new consoles that don't end up actually coming and, you know, a lot of promises that feel like they're not delivered on and this is my long fancy way of saying my official game of the year for 2024 is nothing.

468
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:18,626
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my game of the year.

469
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

470
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:51,570
[SPEAKER_08]: 2024 has been kind of a very hard year to be a gaming fan in many ways and I'm not saying that every game release was bad or especially in the smaller developed and indie teams there aren't things that are worth recognition but I kind of want to use this time to highlight a lot of bullshit that has happened in this industry and a lot of you know big companies just getting bigger eating them up big fish eating bigger fish and just all this crap that's happening

471
00:39:52,730 --> 00:40:20,398
[SPEAKER_08]: it's really a year that feels like in many ways a setback for the industry so I don't think it deserves a game of the year and that's my final answer many people in chat are saying Astro Bot I just actually did not get around to Astro Bot I'm sure it's great I'd love to check it out at some point but even if it was the best thing I've ever played it's not really going to change how I feel about this year as a whole

472
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,124
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

473
00:40:39,495 --> 00:41:08,419
[SPEAKER_03]: um I played Dead by Daylight I have played Fruit Mountain which I'm kind of addicted to um I also oh crap what else was I playing um I'm just gonna leave it at that that's what I was playing cause I don't know I've had so much going on that I'm a little bit like oh yeah and I played Palia that was the other one

474
00:41:10,595 --> 00:41:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

475
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:12,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then we'll go to Loki.

476
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,400
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your game of the week?

477
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:15,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty packed.

478
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I made it a point to try to play some of these games that I had recently picked up or been gifted.

479
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:29,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did get a chance to play some Dungeon Klar, and that was pretty fun.

480
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:29,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I

481
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:53,831
[SPEAKER_05]: had a lot of fun with that it's kind of a roguelike thing where you you know pick up abilities inside of a claw machine they have different abilities that affect you know how the claw machine works and all that and the stuff that you pick up and how much damage it does and so I think that was a pretty easy to understand and pick up and play Peglin I tried that a bit I do like Peggle quite a bit um

482
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:55,302
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:42:17,628 --> 00:42:18,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

484
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think sometimes like a tutorial or something like that is a little bit more helpful to kind of get you into all of that.

485
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, I played a lot of Bellaltro this week as well.

486
00:42:46,062 --> 00:42:51,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Just been getting at least a round in each day, both mobile and on PC.

487
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a lot of fun.

488
00:42:52,764 --> 00:43:02,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the thing I've been working on the most, because I have a few more days off this week, has been my final builds in our season.

489
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, our season is...

490
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:29,335
[SPEAKER_05]: over at the end of this month I mean we were going to end at the end of the year but we gave ourselves an extra like a couple weeks or so and then I think we're starting the new season on middle of February but I've been just working hard to get everything done I think I have all the redstone done for the ride for the most part and there's a few things like with audio and stuff that I have to do um

491
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:46,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But all the major stuff is done now for the ride and so I'm probably to a point where I can finally start building it again on our survival server and collecting all the resources for that because there's a lot of stuff that I need for that.

492
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:48,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be really big.

493
00:43:48,687 --> 00:43:52,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have a couple of the other supporting cast that have been helping me out with...

494
00:43:53,470 --> 00:44:20,885
[SPEAKER_05]: building other sections of the park so one's like a Wild West section that Fish and Suits has been working on and I brought in a roller coaster for my first SMP in there and then our other supporting cast member Oliver is working on this big ice section he's got this enormous cathedral made of ice and stuff over there with like an ice boat race or something that's going to be in there so

495
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:29,313
[SPEAKER_05]: The park is going to double in size by the time... Well, more than double in size by the time it's all done.

496
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of getting it built.

497
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:56,247
[SPEAKER_08]: so hopefully very soon I've been saying that for weeks now because it's been just taking forever but I think we're getting to a point where it's almost actually done nice art takes time all right uh my gaming week uh so I've been playing more World of Warcraft uh my Paladins level 80 and I've been kind of enjoying what all goes on in the end game and all of that stuff I've been playing a little bit of that

498
00:44:57,308 --> 00:45:16,725
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I on Steam I checked out Questmaster that was the game that Loki dropped into my account last week so I fired that up on Steam Deck and it's it's neat so this is basically like it's it's Zelda maker basically legally distinct Zelda maker is what this game is okay so

499
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's by Apogee which I thought was also very interesting because I was like I haven't seen their name on a game in a very long time but I guess maybe they're helping to publish some indie titles now I did enjoy the game I played one of the levels that I guess was random generated there's like a sign post in the town that you can use to access levels and I

500
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:56,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I took the one that it gave me but here's the problem the game is still early access and the tutorial and setup part I think is the part they're still trying to finish because I feel like the town you start in feels like what there's there's nothing really happening here there's like a gamble thing and one other like a ring identifier or something like that but otherwise in that first little town you kind of really end up going nowhere

501
00:45:56,653 --> 00:46:02,096
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was looking at the roadmap for the game and it sounds like earlier this year they are going to finish a fully fledged tutorial which is great.

502
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:16,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to figure most things out in the dungeon that I ended up doing randomly but I wasn't able to beat it because I think there's just some mechanic I didn't understand that might be in the game's rules that because there's not really a fleshed out tutorial I couldn't understand it yet.

503
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: So at this point I kind of go well the game's not done but I also go but...

504
00:46:24,307 --> 00:46:25,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It is early access.

505
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:27,589
[SPEAKER_08]: That is exactly what is advertised.

506
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:28,489
[SPEAKER_08]: The games are not done.

507
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't sit here and say it's bad or anything.

508
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:36,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But all I can say is that if you buy it now, be prepared that you have to do a little bit of your own research and figure some things out.

509
00:46:37,013 --> 00:46:43,436
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have to... And one thing that would have helped me, to be fair, I probably should have just gone into the builder and start seeing what all was available there.

510
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:50,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And that probably would have helped explain to me what some of the mechanics and different things are and why I got stuck in the level I got stuck in and all that good stuff.

511
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:50,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

512
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check it out again for sure.

513
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:59,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those things I'll kind of like, I'm going to keep an eye on this while this game continues to develop.

514
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:00,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll be that kind of thing.

515
00:47:00,803 --> 00:47:04,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kind of keep an eye on it, but ultimately we'll see where it ends up.

516
00:47:06,055 --> 00:47:10,798
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on because that's really all I have for my gaming week.

517
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:12,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a lot else to share, to be honest.

518
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:16,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it's been some of the same old things I've been playing.

519
00:47:16,061 --> 00:47:20,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, actually, one other thing I should mention for sure because I was streaming it on my personal channel.

520
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been getting into doing retro games and trying to beat them.

521
00:47:23,606 --> 00:47:25,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually streamed a good chunk of The Guardian Legend.

522
00:47:25,847 --> 00:47:27,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, we're going to start this year off with a bang.

523
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:28,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do The Guardian Legend.

524
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:34,153
[SPEAKER_08]: I got through, I think, about half the game on my first stream because I'm up to like quarter or six.

525
00:47:35,033 --> 00:47:36,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

526
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Half Bullet Hell Shooter.

527
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:03,962
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really what it is.

528
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:09,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same weapons you get in the Zelda mode, you end up using in Bullet Shooter mode and vice versa.

529
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:10,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really ahead of its time.

530
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:18,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually had one person that came in from my Blue Sky that said, oh, wow, I wonder if I have this game in my collection and I've never played it.

531
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:21,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure enough, he put a follow-up post about an hour later.

532
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:25,985
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, this cartridge was in my collection and somehow I have completely missed this game.

533
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:29,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I would bet a lot of people fire it up

534
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:56,459
[SPEAKER_08]: play that first stage and they go oh and they cry or they go oh it's a shooter game not really my kind of thing and they put it away and they don't know they just cry or they cry from the difficulty I don't actually don't I think like especially when I was playing through it there were parts where it was like okay I need more shields or not there was a mini boss that was tearing me up and like I could not get it until I had enough shields and

535
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:03,064
[SPEAKER_08]: and I found just the right secondary weapon to use against it when I was finally able to get it.

536
00:49:03,685 --> 00:49:06,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I would say there's still some difficulty in there.

537
00:49:06,607 --> 00:49:13,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, if you explore every nook and cranny and make sure you get all your power-ups, I think you can kind of stay on top of the difficulty curve.

538
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:15,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we'll see.

539
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:17,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't finished the game on stream yet.

540
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:20,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to do it on Friday, but I ended up having an IRL thing.

541
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:24,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have an IRL thing on Monday, so I'm hoping maybe Tuesday I can hop back on and finish it up.

542
00:49:24,842 --> 00:49:24,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

543
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:53,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Except Tuesday now I may end up being out of town for work But we'll see, I think I'll be here So Tuesday I will end up playing that But yeah, Guardian Legend, a good old classic And I knew Jamie could appreciate that Because she has a fondness for that game too It's my favorite game I am no longer any good at it I'm going to put that right now You might be, when was the last time I mean, I guess I remember you playing it on stream It was a while ago But I remember you playing it on stream

544
00:49:54,764 --> 00:49:55,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I ever have.

545
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

546
00:49:56,245 --> 00:50:03,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it at home, and since I was playing it on my TV, I had some bad input lag.

547
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it was that I tried to play it using Capture.

548
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:31,959
[SPEAKER_08]: and then I had input lag and so I said I'm gonna do something else no I've been using I'm very open I have the cartridge but I'm using emulators because that way I can do retro achievements and all that stuff and you know the emulators are retro retro arch is good enough for for a simple NES game retro arch is good enough it's not you know not it runs fine so

549
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:39,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news and some other things going on in the gaming world.

550
00:50:40,186 --> 00:50:40,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

551
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,214
[SPEAKER_08]: We just can't stop hearing about Switch 2, huh?

552
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's right around the corner.

553
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:48,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We're expecting announcements very soon.

554
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:51,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, probably this month, I would imagine.

555
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:54,461
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a non-zero chance it's this week.

556
00:50:55,062 --> 00:50:58,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to set the expectations too high, but I was actually looking back on this.

557
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:03,071
[SPEAKER_08]: The original Nintendo Switch's press conference was January 13th.

558
00:51:04,232 --> 00:51:05,352
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

559
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:29,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there is that.

560
00:51:29,642 --> 00:51:32,206
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, again, it could be the week after.

561
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:36,193
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think... And sorry, Loki, I don't mean to derail you, but this has to come up at some point.

562
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,478
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, especially with all the leaks out there.

563
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:39,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I got...

564
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:44,535
[SPEAKER_08]: sent a screenshot of straight up what those controllers look like.

565
00:51:45,076 --> 00:51:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody has just said, here's the controller.

566
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:47,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what they look like.

567
00:51:48,278 --> 00:51:49,719
[SPEAKER_08]: The colors are on the edge now.

568
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:51,600
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very different looking.

569
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they look fine.

570
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:58,265
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm like, there's so much out there that it's like Nintendo just kind of, there's nothing left to hide.

571
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:02,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put it out there because clearly lots of people on the inside have seen this thing at this point.

572
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:07,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really do think no later than next week.

573
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:09,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be very surprised if it's after.

574
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:10,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it's after next week,

575
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:25,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think this thing is launching when we think it does I think we're waiting even longer for it which is going to continue to be frustrating for a lot of people so I would say in the next two weeks and a non-zero chance it's actually this week anyway

576
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:28,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Systems and Methods for Machine Learning Image Conversion

577
00:52:46,927 --> 00:53:04,543
[SPEAKER_05]: and what it it's basically talking about the process that's using AI to upscale textures kind of like DLSS or um PlayStation's PSSR um I think ATIL has or AMD has their own thing um

578
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:20,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what they're essentially doing is they're going to be storing lower resolution textures on the Switch cartridges to keep the file sizes down, but then upscaling that to look nicer on higher resolution displays.

579
00:53:21,247 --> 00:53:26,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of maybe it could be used even for like Switch games on the Switch 2 to...

580
00:53:28,194 --> 00:53:30,255
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially make them look nicer.

581
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:38,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, play them at 1080p or something like that on the portable and then maybe 4K through a dock or something like that.

582
00:53:39,977 --> 00:53:53,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we'll have to see what they announce, but it's not unlikely that they would be using some sort of upscaling for visuals and stuff to crank a little bit more fidelity out of the actual console itself.

583
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,881
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably not going to be super powered either.

584
00:53:57,898 --> 00:54:04,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, as far as the upscaling and all that, though, you know, this is where AI is not so bothersome, right?

585
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:13,499
[SPEAKER_08]: This is where we sort of expect that AI is going to be actually very useful, as in, you know, kind of... It's when it upscales additional fingers and stuff onto the images.

586
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's the other side is when it's talking about replacing art.

587
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:24,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I think just in general, God, I don't know about the rest of you, but how sick am I of AI getting shoved into everything?

588
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:27,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Like even fucking Notepad.

589
00:54:28,295 --> 00:54:31,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Notepad on Microsoft has a button now.

590
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Help me rewrite that.

591
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:32,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like,

592
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:35,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave me the fuck alone.

593
00:54:35,334 --> 00:54:36,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need AI.

594
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't enable any of that.

595
00:54:39,377 --> 00:54:40,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't either.

596
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: On my machine, anyway.

597
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It will just enable itself.

598
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:49,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I might be able to go in and opt out, but the whole thing is just annoying.

599
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:49,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And then

600
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:51,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all saw what Facebook did this week.

601
00:54:51,787 --> 00:54:53,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Meta, whatever you want to call it.

602
00:54:53,187 --> 00:54:54,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all saw what they did this week.

603
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:55,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how much I need to know.

604
00:54:55,508 --> 00:54:57,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we don't have the bots on our platform.

605
00:54:57,308 --> 00:54:59,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's add some more bots to our platform.

606
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:01,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you don't have to actually be on the platform to see it.

607
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:01,870
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all our boost guys.

608
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Meta rolled out those straight up... Well...

609
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:10,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they actually rolled them out this week, but they were discovered because there was talk about those profiles have actually been there since 2023.

610
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:18,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But fake profiles that are full on fake people that you can have AI discussions on that look like real people.

611
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:21,257
[SPEAKER_08]: And DJ Ranma S says, didn't they pull those AI profiles?

612
00:55:21,637 --> 00:55:25,399
[SPEAKER_08]: They did because they were problematic as fuck.

613
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:37,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to get into it, but go look at some of the conversations people were having with some of those profiles and you're going to see how like AI is just not ready to be pushed at a scale that they are pushing it.

614
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,234
[SPEAKER_08]: They are literally trying to sell you chocolate chip cookie dough and not a chocolate chip cookie.

615
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:45,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the kind with raw eggs that might actually kill you.

616
00:55:45,937 --> 00:55:49,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, at least Tom from MySpace was real.

617
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,121
[SPEAKER_08]: That part.

618
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:52,657
[SPEAKER_08]: At least Tom from MySpace was real.

619
00:55:53,018 --> 00:55:56,323
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, I keep most Facebook discussion out of my life.

620
00:55:57,004 --> 00:56:01,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't blame you, but it's getting like... I haven't seen a single thing on Blue Sky about it.

621
00:56:02,813 --> 00:56:05,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Having to dodge...

622
00:56:06,937 --> 00:56:07,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram.

623
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,018
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, Instagram's a necessary evil.

624
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:12,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have it to promote.

625
00:56:13,259 --> 00:56:14,540
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

626
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,561
[SPEAKER_08]: If I don't have it, that's a huge audience I'm missing promotion opportunity and all that stuff with.

627
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have it.

628
00:56:20,742 --> 00:56:29,585
[SPEAKER_08]: To see these sorts of news and things, it's so frustrating because it's literally taking a shit on this platform.

629
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:35,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to push our little indie shows and our scenes and our publicity through, and it's driving people away from

630
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:41,449
[SPEAKER_08]: from the platform that we're trying to use to, you know, get more people to come to our shows.

631
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:44,030
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why this thing is just so frustrating.

632
00:56:44,131 --> 00:56:46,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway.

633
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:47,232
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

634
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:49,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

635
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:52,172
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

636
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of speculation.

637
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:20,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that not happening?

638
00:57:20,629 --> 00:57:25,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Because apparently, previously, the Xbox makers have said it's nothing to do with the technology.

639
00:57:25,813 --> 00:57:35,900
[SPEAKER_08]: But on Chinese social media platform Weibo, Game Science's CEO, Fang Ji, has actually said it's the Xbox Series S.

640
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,582
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

641
00:57:52,341 --> 00:58:02,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is really sounding like we're at a point where the restrictions that Microsoft has where games have to be released on the S and the X are really starting to bite them.

642
00:58:02,507 --> 00:58:13,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So it probably would have been a good prediction to make this year is that Microsoft finally relents on that policy or they basically make it where if you want to play something on the S...

643
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:42,754
[SPEAKER_08]: it uses cloud streaming or something to sort of compensate for the lack of power that the S has which I think would be a great way to make games because you know the S was supposed to be a budget console it's for people that you know don't necessarily have the means or you know money to be able to afford these you know higher end consoles and things like that so I think at least if maybe the S could stream X games or something like that or use cloud technology to do it it would help to bridge the gap a little bit

644
00:58:43,714 --> 00:58:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see where maybe Microsoft could modify the rule to you have to release to the X and cloud streaming so the S people can play it.

645
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:58,662
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really think that this is not the first time we've heard that the Xbox Series S is actively holding Microsoft back.

646
00:59:00,823 --> 00:59:05,905
[SPEAKER_08]: How in the hell is Grand Theft Auto 6 going to work on the Xbox S?

647
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:07,526
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that going to work?

648
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:08,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it...

649
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

650
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's in a better... I mean, look at how 5 has worked for the longest time.

651
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:26,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, 5 was a pretty big marvel when it came to streaming assets because that was released back when they had DVD drives that weren't very fast.

652
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:32,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had to stream that stuff off of those drives to get it to even work.

653
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,682
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times it would even have to be in...

654
00:59:36,787 --> 00:59:37,588
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

655
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:50,633
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

656
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:57,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, going to our chat, Mike Deft with another perspective on this that is absolutely worth reading over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network saying,

657
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:10,101
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

658
01:00:36,011 --> 01:00:39,754
[SPEAKER_03]: and the port that came out in the 90s

659
01:01:05,922 --> 01:01:10,468
[SPEAKER_03]: which, I mean, great game, don't get me wrong, but it's not quite the same.

660
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:20,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are a few folks out there, namely GameDevBoss,

661
01:01:21,593 --> 01:01:35,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Edmocaldus Nemesis Games put together a Genesis slash Mega Drive tech demo of Shadow Dancer Arcade

662
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,915
[SPEAKER_03]: and it looks like it could be very promising.

663
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:47,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I don't know if anyone knows, there is a Genesis port in the process of Symphony of the Night.

664
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:48,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

665
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:49,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is playable.

666
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

667
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious.

668
01:01:52,981 --> 01:01:55,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a ROM floating around out there that you can grab?

669
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:55,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

670
01:01:55,442 --> 01:01:56,182
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's absolutely.

671
01:01:57,303 --> 01:01:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It was linked on Retro RGB.

672
01:02:00,224 --> 01:02:01,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I can... Let me...

673
01:02:02,614 --> 01:02:03,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there's a link.

674
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:04,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

675
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I will find the specific link.

676
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:07,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a YouTube video?

677
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:10,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was like, I just... Okay, here we go.

678
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:10,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I see it.

679
01:02:10,776 --> 01:02:11,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I see it.

680
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:14,597
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, Christmas... Oh, Autumn Update 2024.

681
01:02:15,217 --> 01:02:15,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there we go.

682
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:17,157
[SPEAKER_08]: For Mega Drive and Genesis.

683
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:19,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you just gave me a direct link.

684
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:20,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

685
01:02:20,418 --> 01:02:20,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take a look.

686
01:02:21,018 --> 01:02:21,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.

687
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:22,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that Tom of year again?

688
01:02:22,899 --> 01:02:25,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the demo download is on that video.

689
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, somebody's voice got in there on the stream there.

690
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:31,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Where can we actually see the gameplay?

691
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:33,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Death Fight is in there.

692
01:02:50,902 --> 01:02:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: That isn't that different from what we see on PlayStation, for sure.

693
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:57,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that they changed the little CD logo to MD as well.

694
01:02:57,944 --> 01:02:58,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really cool.

695
01:03:00,264 --> 01:03:03,365
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few different versions of the demo.

696
01:03:03,685 --> 01:03:10,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably suggest the second one, but it's all Dropbox downloads.

697
01:03:10,867 --> 01:03:11,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one...

698
01:03:12,913 --> 01:03:39,060
[SPEAKER_03]: is uh it looks like it's a little buggy it has too many enemies and might freeze up but I mean it's a work in progress I think it's really awesome that's cool love to see the older consoles getting a little love like that that's gonna be fun to play when it comes out there's also a party trying to do Rondo of Blood as well but I I have to go find that again right uh well moving on with newer games Loki

699
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:51,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Notch had put out a survey earlier, I think it was earlier this week, basically saying, honest and legitimate requests for feedback for once.

700
01:03:51,610 --> 01:04:00,500
[SPEAKER_05]: The game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelite, mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler.

701
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:02,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

702
01:04:03,915 --> 01:04:19,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people have... I got thinking that maybe there are some people here who like my work who may not share my taste in retro nostalgia and prefer for me to make a spiritual successor to Minecraft.

703
01:04:19,149 --> 01:04:20,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure, I'd take that cash.

704
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So, market research.

705
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, everybody voted for Minecraft 2.

706
01:04:27,616 --> 01:04:29,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So he is going to...

707
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,622
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially work on something that may be a spiritual successor to Minecraft?

708
01:04:36,723 --> 01:04:37,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

709
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:38,784
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not going to be able to call it Minecraft.

710
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:40,585
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it'll be something else.

711
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:43,587
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got to watch what he calls it on social media, but he sold it.

712
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:44,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything Minecraft, he sold.

713
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:47,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft gets to make Minecraft 2 if they ever want to.

714
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:48,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, that's true.

715
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:53,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be kind of like a bloodstain ritual of the night to Castlevania, you know?

716
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:54,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But he...

717
01:04:55,214 --> 01:05:11,163
[SPEAKER_08]: he's obviously going to lean into that like just from a pure money and publicity perspective he will allow other people to call it Microsoft 2 Minecraft 2 but he's going to have to stay away from calling it that himself or he'll get in a lot of trouble

718
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:37,775
[SPEAKER_08]: of course he will it'll be that movie poster from the creators of Minecraft or from the producer of this movie comes this, you know, that type of thing but Notch has run his mouth a few times online and it is important to say Notch has not always come off as a good person now, I think the last time he got himself into trouble was probably 2019 or something I haven't read what his antics are up to

719
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:59,592
[SPEAKER_08]: if he has changed his outlook on certain things I'm willing to believe that people change especially from COVID and all that stuff but all I'm going to say is that I'm approaching this with a skeptical eye on am I actually going to be able to support this or not because if he still kind of acts like a shit on social media I'm not interested

720
01:06:00,618 --> 01:06:01,438
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for sure.

721
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,498
[SPEAKER_05]: No, understandable.

722
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

723
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:04,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

724
01:06:04,939 --> 01:06:10,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But again... Also, I'm not like... This was five years ago was the last time I think he got in hot water.

725
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,981
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people change, especially in light of COVID and all that stuff.

726
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So if he's at least stopped trying to actively say stupid shit on the internet, I'm willing to take a look at what's under the curtain, you know?

727
01:06:26,334 --> 01:06:55,781
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so we'll see what he says but like I mean honestly even like the last like dev project that he was working on like nothing really came of that either so like I don't know I well didn't he make another game after Minecraft called Scrolls or something because there's a whole big thing with yeah because he was working ironically now we're both Microsoft so like what a what a waste of everybody's fucking time at the end of the day but yeah yeah yeah unfortunately but yeah he was working on a game called Scrolls or whatever and then yeah they

728
01:06:57,315 --> 01:06:58,516
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

729
01:07:18,783 --> 01:07:26,767
[SPEAKER_08]: and maybe he's kind of past that point in his life where Microsoft paid him a disgusting amount of money for Minecraft.

730
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I not wrong?

731
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:32,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't he buy Beyonce's house or something like that or the other way around?

732
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:35,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he got, it was like $2 billion, wasn't it?

733
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:37,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he got oodles of money.

734
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:40,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, that's the time when he started...

735
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:56,942
[SPEAKER_08]: you know kind of blah blah blah blah so this the fact that he's kind of going maybe I want to make an indie game again is kind of making me go okay maybe he's come back down to earth a little bit but cautious optimism bolded italicized underlined mm-hmm

736
01:07:58,415 --> 01:08:01,397
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw in chat says he made over a billion selling Minecraft.

737
01:08:01,437 --> 01:08:02,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that enough to retire?

738
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:03,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

739
01:08:03,899 --> 01:08:14,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But the fact that maybe he doesn't want to is why I'm saying, hmm, this is interesting that there could be some type of maybe changed outlook on things on his end.

740
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:15,667
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

741
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:19,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But remember, actions speak louder than words.

742
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

743
01:08:22,196 --> 01:08:41,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, let's talk about a game company that I actually talking about Guardian Legend and all this stuff, I have often invoked Inti Creates as a company I would love to see create a new Guardian Legend type of game because they did Blaster Master Zero and I thought they did a very good job with that.

744
01:08:41,643 --> 01:08:48,806
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few companies I think I would trust doing the Guardian Legend if we were to ever get that, but I think at this point it's a fever dream.

745
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:49,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But

746
01:08:50,186 --> 01:08:53,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Inti Creates has said they are looking to announce several titles this year.

747
01:08:53,728 --> 01:08:55,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I don't want to set unreasonable expectations.

748
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,491
[SPEAKER_08]: The Guardian Legend is OLR fanfic.

749
01:08:58,651 --> 01:08:59,572
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not reality.

750
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:01,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't even put your expectations there.

751
01:09:01,813 --> 01:09:05,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still interested in what they are going to announce, though, because I enjoy the things they've put out.

752
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: They are going to be placing a focus on what they call their 2D action games.

753
01:09:11,299 --> 01:09:15,682
[SPEAKER_08]: On social media, CEO and President Takuya Aizu said, Happy New Year!

754
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:22,726
[SPEAKER_08]: This year we plan to announce several titles with a focus on our company's specialty of 2D action games.

755
01:09:23,467 --> 01:09:29,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Some games that Inti creates released in 2024 include Gunvolt Records' Chironical,

756
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:39,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Umbra Claw, Card and Seal on the Switch, and then Gal Guardians, Servants of the Dark, which is kind of a Castlevania-esque sort of game.

757
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:42,476
[SPEAKER_08]: That is coming out in March, and we know about that as well.

758
01:09:42,776 --> 01:09:49,619
[SPEAKER_08]: There also was Divine Dynamo Flamefrit in November of 2024, which was a top-down dungeon crawler.

759
01:09:50,579 --> 01:10:18,929
[SPEAKER_08]: which got okay reviews but it wasn't something that was like going to be game of the year which again that game was similar to Card and Seal which is more of like a deck building roguelike type of game so you see that they've kind of done these things you know a little bit around the board which is fine you know when you're a when you're a small gaming company you know kind of doing your thing and your games are well received you get to experiment a little bit but it is fun to hear that it sounds like they're going to go back to their roots this year a little bit so we'll we'll see we'll see what happens

760
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:25,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tatooine chats, as I was going to say, I know they came up during Rob's Guardian Legend stream, so you never know.

761
01:10:26,034 --> 01:10:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Compile is technically still around, so there's that slim chance.

762
01:10:29,615 --> 01:10:36,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it is determined that Irem is the company that would need to agree that the Guardian Legend is allowed to continue.

763
01:10:37,078 --> 01:10:37,879
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the company...

764
01:10:38,899 --> 01:11:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: even though yes Compile still exists I believe Compile made the game for Irem using Irem IPs so that's the company you need to get on board with a new Guardian Legend but again I want to watch because I don't want to project my fan fiction as any sort of expectation that's not fair to Inti Creates and the games they want to make um

765
01:11:01,621 --> 01:11:03,242
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

766
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:46,801
[SPEAKER_03]: well I do like my pinball so Stern actually and even Dan sent me this put out a trailer for Dungeons and Dragons The Tyrant's Eye on pinball it's looking pretty neat it also has voice cast from Critical Role and there is different musicians included like Gerard Way

767
01:11:49,263 --> 01:12:15,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke Gygax is involved Kevin Smith is involved and Chris Velasco who did music for Bloodborne and Mass Effect 2 is doing music for Tyrant's Eye so yeah it's the lead designer is Brian Eddy who did Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness so definitely some good stuff there I'm

768
01:12:17,578 --> 01:12:18,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty excited by it.

769
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:22,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much said that this has to happen.

770
01:12:25,722 --> 01:12:28,164
[SPEAKER_08]: This table looks rad as fuck, to be honest.

771
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the trailer cross by my social media feed and I was like, this is really... I love the idea of the randomly generated weekly... That's such a brilliant idea to try to get people to come back and play over and over.

772
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:44,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you're a private owner, like yourself, Jamie, or Bobby Blackwell... I don't want it.

773
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:44,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

774
01:12:45,473 --> 01:12:47,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you're in this, Loki?

775
01:12:47,374 --> 01:12:47,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh!

776
01:12:48,134 --> 01:12:49,455
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it just looks cool.

777
01:12:49,475 --> 01:12:50,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't buy it.

778
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:51,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too expensive.

779
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:53,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, it looks awesome, though.

780
01:12:53,316 --> 01:12:56,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I was going to get a table, like, that would probably be it.

781
01:12:56,938 --> 01:13:01,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm kind of hoping, like, you know, obviously I would love to go to DarkSakura's house to play it if she gets it.

782
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:06,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, Coin-Off or one of those other places, if they get it, too, I'd probably go check it out.

783
01:13:07,302 --> 01:13:10,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some beef, though, with some of the people at Coin-Off.

784
01:13:11,124 --> 01:13:11,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

785
01:13:12,409 --> 01:13:21,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want to get too far into it, but I was there recently and I kind of noticed, even though they've remodeled the whole place and it looks nicer, the game selection's gone downhill.

786
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:46,819
[SPEAKER_08]: they've they've leaned into ticket munchers and that whole thing and that's unfortunate like their whole pinball thing in the back not what it used to be that's all ticket munchers now yeah exactly that so I think you and I are on a similar page but you probably know more about what's going on I just as a customer I went and I went oh this is a little disappointing all right uh anyhow let's move on Loki

787
01:13:48,396 --> 01:14:13,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so it's funny, we talked about Bolaltro having some issues with the ESRB and being rated, you know, mature or, you know, AO in certain regions because of gambling mechanics which is funny compared to all these games that have actual gambling in them

788
01:14:14,457 --> 01:14:15,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the game's not like that.

789
01:14:15,778 --> 01:14:25,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game Luck Be a Landlord, which was a game that did inspire the creator to create Bolaltro, has a slot machine mechanic that's in the game.

790
01:14:25,947 --> 01:14:27,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, no actual gambling.

791
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:29,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a mechanic of the game.

792
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:33,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are running into the same problem on the Google Play Store.

793
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:36,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, that they've been...

794
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:39,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

795
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:53,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

796
01:14:53,587 --> 01:14:53,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

797
01:15:13,032 --> 01:15:33,562
[SPEAKER_05]: but they are fighting it right now it says I've now filled out the Google Play age rating questionnaire to agree that my game contains gambling I'm doing this in an attempt to stop my game from being banned globally on Google Play since every time I've tried to appeal these decisions I've been simply sent a screenshot of my game and was told this is gambling

798
01:15:36,104 --> 01:15:37,465
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have actual people.

799
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:39,567
[SPEAKER_08]: You really need to have actual people that look at this.

800
01:15:39,627 --> 01:15:41,448
[SPEAKER_08]: This is so silly.

801
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:46,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And it almost makes you go, it feels like somebody is out to get this game and reported it.

802
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:53,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's always some loser on the internet that wants to be a cop and go out there and try to police all this stuff.

803
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:55,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've heard a lot of this stuff with the YouTube.

804
01:15:55,619 --> 01:16:03,384
[SPEAKER_08]: There was this whole thing about Nintendo YouTubes getting pulled out where the guy was faking being a lawyer for Nintendo, allegedly, and all this stuff.

805
01:16:03,464 --> 01:16:04,885
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, oh my gosh.

806
01:16:05,906 --> 01:16:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

807
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:31,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And although we don't often get a ton of gaming news at a consumer electronics show, sometimes we get just that, new electronics.

808
01:16:32,215 --> 01:16:36,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Which could mean, historically, it's been things like new arcade 1-up machines and things of that sort.

809
01:16:36,999 --> 01:16:38,580
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen that sort of thing happen before.

810
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:46,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But I believe on that front, I think arcade 1-up has said they're not actually going to be there this year, so don't get your hopes up for that.

811
01:16:47,067 --> 01:16:51,130
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are getting a glance at the Atari...

812
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:58,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Station, the Atari Game Station Go is what we're seeing a little tease of here.

813
01:16:59,098 --> 01:17:08,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know a lot about it, except it looks like a lot of the contemporary sorts of things, like say a Steam Deck or something, except there's that number pad that shows up.

814
01:17:08,243 --> 01:17:13,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it actually has, and knowing that Atari, see a lot of people are reading into this saying,

815
01:17:13,726 --> 01:17:32,759
[SPEAKER_08]: well Atari did have a number pad at some point that released a limited number of games I'm sitting here going did you all do you all have amnesia Atari bought Intellivision hello so I mean that keypad could be used potentially for some Intellivision games which for some reason is not being called out in any of these articles but whatever um

816
01:17:34,381 --> 01:17:35,662
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what else is going to be on this.

817
01:17:35,722 --> 01:17:45,373
[SPEAKER_08]: The trailer only shows what this thing looks like, and we know it is a product between Atari and My Arcade, which has already released some.

818
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I have an Atari console that was sold at Costco, a 2600+.

819
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:52,820
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

820
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:15,411
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I getting out of this that emulators won't get me?

821
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:41,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a key question that even if the answer in fact is, well, this is legal, that answer is not going to be good enough.

822
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:44,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they think it is going to be good enough, they are foolish.

823
01:18:44,654 --> 01:18:46,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not saying it should be that way.

824
01:18:46,075 --> 01:18:46,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying it is.

825
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that whole discussion about facts?

826
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:50,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reality.

827
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be curious to see what they do with this.

828
01:18:54,323 --> 01:18:56,525
[SPEAKER_08]: But it has an HDMI port.

829
01:18:56,885 --> 01:19:01,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It has USB-C ports on the top, maybe for some controllers, some LED lighting.

830
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:05,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be curious to see what happens with this.

831
01:19:05,873 --> 01:19:10,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So it should be pointed out the My Arcade Game Station Pro is...

832
01:19:11,098 --> 01:19:13,178
[SPEAKER_08]: had 200 titles built into it.

833
01:19:14,019 --> 01:19:20,040
[SPEAKER_08]: But more information on this will be unveiled at CES, which is next week, starting on Tuesday.

834
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:25,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can see if they are able to answer that question or not.

835
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:28,262
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S says support for Jaguar games.

836
01:19:28,882 --> 01:19:30,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Emulators can run Jaguar games.

837
01:19:30,502 --> 01:19:32,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaguar games are in Atari 50.

838
01:19:33,543 --> 01:19:36,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And funny enough, DarkSakura and I were just talking about this before the show.

839
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:39,644
[SPEAKER_08]: You were mentioning an analog Jaguar product, right?

840
01:19:40,763 --> 01:19:43,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw something about it popping up as a story.

841
01:19:43,385 --> 01:19:44,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't dig too deeply into it.

842
01:19:45,146 --> 01:19:45,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

843
01:19:45,846 --> 01:19:48,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I think there's a tough question here to answer.

844
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:50,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll see.

845
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,449
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

846
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:53,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a sucker for retro games and these sorts of things.

847
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:57,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if I see myself buying a dedicated handheld.

848
01:19:58,114 --> 01:20:03,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like, again, I don't really do a ton of handheld gaming and the Steam Deck now more than has that covered.

849
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:07,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more a sucker for these sorts of collectibles, like the tiny arcade games.

850
01:20:07,361 --> 01:20:14,785
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, all these little, you know, on Twitch, you see very tiny little baby arcade machines that are more, they run off batteries.

851
01:20:14,825 --> 01:20:16,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I don't have them running during the show.

852
01:20:17,206 --> 01:20:24,490
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're very, very, they're usually like Coleco versions of arcade games on little tiny, a lot of these are by My Arcade.

853
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,692
[SPEAKER_08]: There were basically two companies that made these.

854
01:20:26,732 --> 01:20:28,893
[SPEAKER_08]: The My Arcade ones are slightly larger.

855
01:20:29,293 --> 01:20:30,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So My Arcade

856
01:20:30,894 --> 01:20:35,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though you may not recognize that name, they've been in this retro game for a little while.

857
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:38,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was buying these pre-COVID.

858
01:20:39,197 --> 01:20:42,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've been in the retro game for a little while, so it's worth keeping an eye on.

859
01:20:43,098 --> 01:20:49,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, since I brought up retro games, what a good time to get into a regular segment we do here on OLR.

860
01:21:00,498 --> 01:21:07,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

861
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

862
01:21:12,107 --> 01:21:13,228
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, DarkSakura.

863
01:21:14,248 --> 01:21:15,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe this game is this old.

864
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:16,330
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you pick?

865
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:20,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither can I. It's Batman Arkham Asylum from 2009.

866
01:21:21,073 --> 01:21:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: The game was developed by Rocksteady Studios, published by Eidos Interactive, working with Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, based off of the DC Comics Batman.

867
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it went into...

868
01:21:42,182 --> 01:22:09,836
[SPEAKER_03]: quite a bit of things that were heavily influenced from various classic stories in the comics of course Battling the Joker but there's also other baddies hanging around it seems like it was inspired by some of the writing of Neil Adams and Frank Miller and some Grant Morrison it was run in Unreal Engine 3

869
01:22:10,996 --> 01:22:16,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did go through quite a bit of changes before it came out, but this was definitely...

870
01:22:18,027 --> 01:22:19,769
[SPEAKER_03]: A game that I think was well received.

871
01:22:19,889 --> 01:22:21,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a feeling it would be.

872
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:24,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So they put definite hints to sequels buried in the game.

873
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:33,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in August 2009 with a Windows version to follow.

874
01:22:34,301 --> 01:22:43,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won awards and actually held the Guinness World Record for most critically acclaimed superhero game ever.

875
01:22:45,678 --> 01:22:57,564
[SPEAKER_03]: it had a game of the year edition in 2010 a remastered one for PS4 and Xbox One in 2016 and a Switch version that came out in 2023 and it launched an entire series

876
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:00,618
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is an action-adventure game.

877
01:23:00,678 --> 01:23:02,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from a third-person perspective.

878
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:16,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get yourself trapped in Arkham Asylum, where basically the inmates have taken it over.

879
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:44,963
[SPEAKER_03]: you have detective vision where you activate this mode to get more clues by highlighting certain things and looking at skeletons and destructible walls and your enemies so you basically have can see where everyone and everything's weaknesses you have a batarang you have a remote controlled version that you can follow and sometimes you can find different little easter eggs that way

880
01:23:45,663 --> 01:23:49,344
[SPEAKER_03]: or even use it to be a distraction or diversion.

881
01:23:49,784 --> 01:23:53,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You also are finding notes left by the Riddler.

882
01:23:56,246 --> 01:24:04,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And he hacks into Batman's comms to give him some clues and different riddles too.

883
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very free flow... They call it free flow combat.

884
01:24:09,491 --> 01:24:12,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you have attack, stun, and counter for your combat.

885
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can combine these to do all kinds of different moves and stuff.

886
01:24:16,075 --> 01:24:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get experience points for combat.

887
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Basically, you... It's an older game, but you also...

888
01:24:31,981 --> 01:24:35,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one that's way too involved for me to actually go into a lot.

889
01:24:36,726 --> 01:24:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that the Windows version was compatible... Sorry, it uses NVIDIA's physics software to create its interactions.

890
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also...

891
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, had all kinds of other effects that were in it, very dynamic.

892
01:24:58,187 --> 01:25:07,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Game of the Year edition let you use a 3D mode by using any TV that had the anaglyph 3D glasses.

893
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:32,215
[SPEAKER_03]: so there was that of course we had the three probably most well-known voices for any Batman series ever Kevin Conroy, rest in peace as Batman Mark Hamill as the Joker Arlene Sorkin as Harley Quinn so there you go

894
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:52,547
[SPEAKER_03]: um it uh was uh it started well it was announced in August 2008 developed by Rocksteady Studios um you know again with Eidos and Warner Brothers Interactive and uh they uh

895
01:25:54,551 --> 01:26:05,437
[SPEAKER_03]: started going into full production as of September, bringing in Paul Dini, who was a writer for the animated series and in Detective Comics.

896
01:26:06,738 --> 01:26:13,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it basically just went fully into design mode.

897
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:16,363
[SPEAKER_03]: They hadn't finished the cast, but they had the setting.

898
01:26:16,403 --> 01:26:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew Joker was going to be in it.

899
01:26:18,945 --> 01:26:23,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a matter of bringing in

900
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:52,781
[SPEAKER_03]: like I mentioned earlier elements from some of different writers but as well as how to use certain items were actually influenced by Legend of Zelda and Metroid games so there for anyone who remembers E3 2009 it was hardcore like it had a big section for its marketing and

901
01:26:54,904 --> 01:27:19,403
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that too, because it was so well received, there was a collector's edition that had a 14 inch or 36 centimeter replica of the Batarang, a behind the scenes DVD, a 48 page book about Arkham's inmate, and it was leather bound, a code to download Crime Alley challenge map,

902
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:27,140
[SPEAKER_03]: and you also could get Den Bones challenge map by ordering at certain retailers.

903
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:36,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game of the Year edition was announced originally only for Europe, Asia, and Australia but of course there was a North American release later.

904
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had the game, the Trioviz 3D visual effects, two pairs of themed 3D glasses and the six released DLC challenge maps, two of which were not made available in North America.

905
01:27:54,437 --> 01:28:03,163
[SPEAKER_03]: There was downloadable content that was available exclusively for PlayStation 3 and Mac OS X

906
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:30,766
[SPEAKER_03]: there were the later release the Insane Night Pack with the Totally Insane Combat and Nocturnal Hunter was released November 17th sorry September 17th 2009 Prey in the Darkness, A Heart of Darkness Hot House Prey and it was the Prey in the Darkness Pack was an exclusive again for PS3 and Mac OS X there was

907
01:28:32,447 --> 01:28:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman Return to Arkham by Virtuos that was a compilation of a remastered Arkham Asylum and Arkham City for Unreal Engine 4.

908
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:51,078
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an Arkham trilogy that was developed by Turn Me Up that also included Batman Arkham Knight for Switch.

909
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:56,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so here is where we get into the reception.

910
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:23,939
[SPEAKER_03]: it was basically its Metacritic score for Xbox 360 gave it a 92 out of 100 PlayStation 3 got 91 out of 100 the Windows version the same it held the Guinness World Record for most critically acclaimed superhero game ever until it was succeeded by Arkham City so there you go

911
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:54,089
[SPEAKER_03]: and it everyone just loved it everyone was like this is the best you know it shows what a superhero game is it was engaging the story setting everything was amazing and it was referred to I like this description by Andy Robinson of Computer and Video Games said it is a thinking man's stealth game I think that's a great thing and there were

912
01:29:56,534 --> 01:30:17,419
[SPEAKER_03]: you had like Scarecrow the Scarecrow battles were definitely praised as some of the most and I'm quoting cerebral moments because it manipulates the fourth wall I thought that was pretty cool they put it along the lines of the Psycho Mantis battle in Metal Gear Solid and

913
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:39,846
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah it won bajillions awards um it won outstanding achievement in the AIAS 13th annual interactive achievement awards uh game design adaptive story character performance by Mark Hamill um nominated for game of the year adventure of the year it

914
01:30:40,524 --> 01:31:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: it won many many and it was also the highest rated uh uh hold on I lost where I was oh yeah it was the highest rated Microsoft Windows game alongside Dragon Age Origins and Street Fighter 4 so yeah I I am I'm not gonna name all of the things it won a bunch of the things

915
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: it won two BAFTAs I mean, there you go so yeah and going into a little bit more, Grant Morrison said that it influenced the Batman Incorporated comic books and was quoted saying, when I played that game it was the first time in my life I actually felt what it was like to be Batman high praise yeah

916
01:31:34,158 --> 01:32:01,895
[SPEAKER_08]: so there you go I didn't even touch everything I caressed it a little bit that's fine Batman Arkham Asylum your classic game of the week and yeah gosh I'm 15 years old at this point not just 10 but 15 16 really and also I kind of have to thank Nick for influencing this one because he suggested the Batman Ness game but I was like no I'm going to do Arkham okay alright

917
01:32:02,555 --> 01:32:03,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the Batman NES game.

918
01:32:04,016 --> 01:32:07,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was surprised that I have not done a single Batman game.

919
01:32:08,599 --> 01:32:08,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

920
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,461
[SPEAKER_07]: There were some bad ones over the years.

921
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:16,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we have some rapid fire news we're going to get into.

922
01:32:16,164 --> 01:32:19,547
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also going to get into, sooner rather than later, a listener roundtable.

923
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:24,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to give us a call, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

924
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:26,472
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, we have some more stories coming at you.

925
01:32:26,492 --> 01:32:28,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So Loki, let's go to some rapid fire news.

926
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:36,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's so crazy to think that, you know, the thing that it takes to get someone out of retirement when it comes to acting is money.

927
01:32:37,421 --> 01:32:40,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the case, I guess, with Jim Carrey.

928
01:32:40,262 --> 01:32:46,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, we have confirmation that they've already greenlit a fourth Sonic movie.

929
01:32:46,783 --> 01:32:50,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, hey, I wouldn't mind coming back to be Eggman again.

930
01:32:53,164 --> 01:32:56,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him in a fourth Sonic movie.

931
01:32:56,205 --> 01:32:57,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that'll happen.

932
01:32:58,533 --> 01:32:59,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though he's, like, died.

933
01:33:01,174 --> 01:33:02,254
[SPEAKER_05]: But whatever, you know.

934
01:33:02,274 --> 01:33:02,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Spoilers.

935
01:33:02,595 --> 01:33:03,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

936
01:33:04,235 --> 01:33:05,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he dies in, like, all of them.

937
01:33:05,756 --> 01:33:06,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

938
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:09,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine it's one of those things that's humorous at this point.

939
01:33:09,437 --> 01:33:15,399
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I think I saw something in Discord because, you know, Tigerclaw's a huge Sonic fan and posts a lot of stuff on Discord about that.

940
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,861
[SPEAKER_08]: The movie made a billion worldwide across that mark.

941
01:33:20,101 --> 01:33:20,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It's made a lot.

942
01:33:20,722 --> 01:33:21,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that.

943
01:33:21,182 --> 01:33:21,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's made a lot.

944
01:33:23,342 --> 01:33:33,833
[SPEAKER_08]: or maybe that's the whole franchise is made a billion one movie making a billion that's a lot but the whole franchise yeah still impressive that seems a little high for one movie but I know it did pretty well so I don't know franchise made a billion yeah okay

945
01:33:35,733 --> 01:34:02,274
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we've got some Sonic games you can check out so one thing that's kind of nice about Sega is they do kind of give a green light to fans making fan games and one of those is Sonic Galactic it looks really cool they said it's I guess it's kind of it looks like a

946
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:06,297
[SPEAKER_05]: A 2D Sonic game, but with better graphics.

947
01:34:06,477 --> 01:34:10,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they also have these sections that are like 2.5D almost.

948
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That look kind of cool.

949
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like running on a wall or something like that.

950
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:16,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I really liked how it looked.

951
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:18,523
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's got five playable characters in there.

952
01:34:18,603 --> 01:34:24,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic the Tails, Knuckles, Fang the Sniper, and... Who's the other one?

953
01:34:24,265 --> 01:34:25,606
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another one in there as well.

954
01:34:26,106 --> 01:34:26,766
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a mole.

955
01:34:28,047 --> 01:34:28,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Tunnel the Mole.

956
01:34:29,087 --> 01:34:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an original character.

957
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:35,168
[SPEAKER_05]: that they may make new friends for Sonic.

958
01:34:35,248 --> 01:34:38,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely looks legit.

959
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:44,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good thing Sega is usually pretty friendly to these sorts of projects and probably won't be trying to shut this one down anytime soon, but yeah.

960
01:34:45,472 --> 01:34:47,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, the multiplayer mode looks kind of cute.

961
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:50,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the graphics look really cool.

962
01:34:50,415 --> 01:34:52,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like either 32X or...

963
01:34:54,622 --> 01:35:21,930
[SPEAKER_05]: you know something but I like the that like quasi 2D thing that they've got it's like on a wall or something like that yeah I don't know like a bonus stage thing looks fun looks neat yeah great uh but yeah if you're interested in that you can check it out at um sonicgalactic.github.io all right uh let's move on DarkSakura

964
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:34,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is the Arcade Archives Castle of Dragon coming to the Switch on already out.

965
01:35:37,262 --> 01:35:38,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's already out.

966
01:35:39,142 --> 01:35:40,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out on the second.

967
01:35:40,803 --> 01:35:45,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is available for download.

968
01:35:46,184 --> 01:35:51,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the arcade archive series by Hamster.

969
01:35:52,286 --> 01:36:02,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an action game that was released by Athena in 1993 where you are two kings to go to a castle inhabited by dragons and save a princess.

970
01:36:02,828 --> 01:36:05,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Trope, trope, trope, trope, trope.

971
01:36:05,909 --> 01:36:06,329
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

972
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:10,873
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

973
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:13,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to this story real quick.

974
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:18,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Since it is the beginning of the year, that means it's time for another Awesome Games Done Quick.

975
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 did get underway today.

976
01:36:21,806 --> 01:36:24,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they kicked off with Astro Bot was the first game

977
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,891
[SPEAKER_08]: that they did earlier.

978
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:28,913
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was, I'm sorry, Pikmin looks like was the first game.

979
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Astro Bot was just a highlight from today's set that is going on there.

980
01:36:33,776 --> 01:36:38,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Tomb Raider is the next game they're about to get into as we're taping live here.

981
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're somewhere between this Zelda the Wind Waker and Tomb Raider run.

982
01:36:43,342 --> 01:36:44,583
[SPEAKER_08]: They might be right in between here.

983
01:36:45,243 --> 01:36:47,325
[SPEAKER_08]: as we are live doing our show tonight.

984
01:36:47,805 --> 01:36:56,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know by now, the Awesome Games Done Quick charity, it's raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation because, you know, fuck cancer.

985
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:01,236
[SPEAKER_08]: But they raised an awful lot of money for it, and they're going to run for the entire...

986
01:37:01,736 --> 01:37:01,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fun.

987
01:37:17,253 --> 01:37:17,994
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be fun.

988
01:37:18,054 --> 01:37:19,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

989
01:37:19,395 --> 01:37:20,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Raising money for a great cause.

990
01:37:20,856 --> 01:37:23,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other games to look forward to on the final day.

991
01:37:23,617 --> 01:37:24,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Final day is pretty stacked.

992
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:26,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Elden Ring is there during the final day.

993
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,161
[SPEAKER_08]: The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

994
01:37:29,842 --> 01:37:32,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Echoes of Wisdom is a bonus game.

995
01:37:32,223 --> 01:37:34,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that means if they raise enough money, they'll do that.

996
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:41,048
[SPEAKER_08]: and the much-anticipated Crazy Taxi with Live Backing Band is also on Saturday.

997
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

998
01:37:41,748 --> 01:37:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

999
01:37:42,129 --> 01:37:42,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about that.

1000
01:37:42,749 --> 01:37:46,591
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to be a pretty stacked day there for Awesome Games Done Quick.

1001
01:37:46,871 --> 01:37:47,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Please enjoy.

1002
01:37:48,392 --> 01:37:51,173
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1003
01:37:52,694 --> 01:37:54,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll go to here in the U.S.

1004
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:54,875
[SPEAKER_08]: first.

1005
01:37:54,975 --> 01:37:55,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1006
01:37:56,531 --> 01:38:23,787
[SPEAKER_05]: not a whole lot coming out this week but we've got Sea Fantasy on PC Ys Memoir The Oath in Fengana that's going to be on Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 The Fox's Way Home on Nintendo Switch Freedom Wars Remastered on PC, Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 and that's it

1007
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,951
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, traveling to Japan.

1008
01:38:28,112 --> 01:38:31,135
[SPEAKER_08]: We at least are getting releases again, but it is still a slow week.

1009
01:38:31,515 --> 01:38:38,440
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Nintendo Switch, we have Freedom Wars Remastered releases on January 9th, and that is the lone release on the Nintendo Switch.

1010
01:38:38,981 --> 01:38:43,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is also being released on the PlayStation 5, Freedom Wars Remastered.

1011
01:38:43,664 --> 01:38:46,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, that is pretty much your only big release.

1012
01:38:47,567 --> 01:38:49,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Honkai Star Rail is out next week.

1013
01:38:50,429 --> 01:38:54,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine a lot of people grabbed that digitally, but there's the Trailblazer edition coming out on the 15th.

1014
01:38:55,774 --> 01:38:59,538
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as this week goes, still a little slow, but at least there's something.

1015
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,139
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1016
01:39:03,262 --> 01:39:07,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom Wars Remastered for Switch on PS4, PS5, PC on January 10th.

1017
01:39:08,687 --> 01:39:08,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1018
01:39:09,348 --> 01:39:09,648
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1019
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:10,549
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1020
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:14,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We still gotta ease into the year a little bit, but in a couple weeks it'll get going again.

1021
01:39:15,154 --> 01:39:20,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I think we just have one quick story here, and boy, if this isn't a prediction... And we did get an email.

1022
01:39:20,817 --> 01:39:21,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Just foreshadowing.

1023
01:39:21,997 --> 01:39:22,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

1024
01:39:22,618 --> 01:39:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray.

1025
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:24,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we'll get to that in just a moment.

1026
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:31,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have one story here that's very... What a 2025 kind of story.

1027
01:39:31,822 --> 01:39:32,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Way to kick things off, right?

1028
01:39:33,943 --> 01:39:34,684
[SPEAKER_05]: What year is this?

1029
01:39:34,704 --> 01:39:36,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to really do this again?

1030
01:39:36,365 --> 01:39:38,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we really seeing this again?

1031
01:39:40,127 --> 01:40:00,923
[SPEAKER_05]: but yes, apparently there's been a tweet by Mike Shapiro who you may know as the voice actor of the G-Man from the Half-Life series putting out some cryptic thing on Twitter talking about what's coming in 2025 I think

1032
01:40:07,683 --> 01:40:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: uh that's cool and all but I think that people may be misinterpreting what that's teasing because you know everyone's like oh Half-Life 3 obviously but you may remember what else is G-Man in that is going to be getting its absolute cinematic release in the movie movie sphere why it's Skivity Toilet and G-Man is in Skivity Toilet technically so I think that's what they're teasing

1033
01:40:37,606 --> 01:40:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly not Half-Life 3.

1034
01:40:39,107 --> 01:40:43,408
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds completely reasonable, to be honest, Loki, with the direction you're going with it.

1035
01:40:44,468 --> 01:40:45,108
[SPEAKER_08]: But stay tuned.

1036
01:40:45,128 --> 01:40:55,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm just kind of rolling my eyes at Half-Life 3 teases this week, although they did go back and do all that work with Half-Life 2 for the anniversary, but I don't know.

1037
01:40:55,532 --> 01:40:58,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like Half-Life Alex was Half-Life 3.

1038
01:40:58,953 --> 01:41:01,133
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you get.

1039
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:01,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1040
01:41:02,034 --> 01:41:04,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just like it'd be a new Half-Life thing.

1041
01:41:04,474 --> 01:41:05,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be 3.

1042
01:41:05,675 --> 01:41:06,255
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be just...

1043
01:41:07,594 --> 01:41:08,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Something new, I guess.

1044
01:41:10,336 --> 01:41:10,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough.

1045
01:41:10,816 --> 01:41:13,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Another side story to prevent Valve from having to print the number three.

1046
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:16,500
[SPEAKER_08]: The three key is broken on all of their computers, as it turns out.

1047
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:17,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Portal 3.

1048
01:41:19,355 --> 01:41:22,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well this is the part of the show where we get into the listener roundtable.

1049
01:41:22,797 --> 01:41:24,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Reread your emails.

1055
01:41:42,567 --> 01:41:43,608
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, you said you had an email.

1056
01:41:45,376 --> 01:41:47,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'll read it.

1057
01:41:48,077 --> 01:41:49,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear OLR, it's your girl Mishi here.

1058

[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say, as always, great work on the show.

[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to see it's still going and I hope it keeps going.

1060
01:41:55,641 --> 01:41:57,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a household staple here in our house.

1061
01:41:58,563 --> 01:41:59,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the good work, y'all.

1062
01:41:59,883 --> 01:42:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of games and it seems like my new faves are Stellar Blade and, of course, Astro Blot.

1063
01:42:05,646 --> 01:42:30,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I did find a new to me Metroidvania similar to Hollow Knight called Voidrot and mad shout out to our own DarkSakura for the heads up and checking out Fantasian Neo Dimension it's got really deep FF7 and I think DarkTutsi has said 4 or 6 as well I'm really enjoying it anyway just wanted to give you something to read for the show have a good one and stay awesome always Mishi

1064
01:42:30,967 --> 01:42:31,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Mishi.

1065
01:42:31,547 --> 01:42:32,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

1066
01:42:32,828 --> 01:42:34,149
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, you're reminding me.

1067
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:36,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to make time for Fantasia and Neo Dimension.

1068
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:37,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to play it.

1069
01:42:40,592 --> 01:42:43,733
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, only so much time in the day, right?

1070
01:42:43,833 --> 01:42:45,314
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really want to make time for that one.

1071
01:42:46,014 --> 01:42:48,976
[SPEAKER_08]: As an old school Final Fantasy fan, I feel like I owe it to myself to play that one.

1072
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:51,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like DarkSakura would agree.

1073
01:42:54,178 --> 01:42:54,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1074
01:42:54,739 --> 01:42:56,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you so much for the email, Mishi.

1075
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:56,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate you.

1076
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you're having a great 2025 so far.

1077
01:43:00,186 --> 01:43:00,706
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1078
01:43:01,186 --> 01:43:03,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Just some comments from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1079
01:43:04,007 --> 01:43:08,429
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, Jason Schreier, I forget, what's the big player?

1080
01:43:09,029 --> 01:43:10,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Was he Washington Post, New York Times?

1081
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,030
[SPEAKER_08]: He's one of those big players.

1082
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:13,211
[SPEAKER_08]: He used to be Taku years and years ago, right?

1083
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Now he kind of does more indie stuff.

1084
01:43:14,511 --> 01:43:15,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Bloomberg was the big thing, right?

1085
01:43:16,372 --> 01:43:18,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I said it right as Bobby put it in chat.

1086
01:43:18,092 --> 01:43:18,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Bloomberg.

1087
01:43:20,493 --> 01:43:25,660
[SPEAKER_08]: He is predicting that Half-Life 3 is one of his 2025 predictions.

1088
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,841
[SPEAKER_08]: That Half-Life 3 is actually happening.

1089
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:30,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe reading into the obvious read on that last story.

1090
01:43:30,906 --> 01:43:33,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if he said that before or after what you were saying.

1091
01:43:33,529 --> 01:43:34,410
[SPEAKER_08]: If he said it before...

1092
01:43:35,458 --> 01:44:02,390
[SPEAKER_08]: that's interesting because that guy does have his ear he has this you know for for better or whatever he he does have a lot more industry people to talk to him uh and can probably get a better read on some stuff that's going on in the industry so if he's saying that it does raise an eyebrow um but again I'll believe it when I see it as I think most of us are at that point yeah I like the idea of Half-Life spinoff though especially something that maybe would complement like a Steam Deck refresh

1093
01:44:03,476 --> 01:44:30,042
[SPEAKER_08]: you know like if the Steam Deck were to get a refresh this year like imagine like a Half-Life game that runs really well on that and somehow is you know I don't know what it would do differently you know tailored to that whether using touchscreen or something but but I don't know that's why my brain my brain is going maybe there'd be something to really push more Steam Decks in that regard I mean if Switch 2 has their own launch titles maybe a Steam Deck 2 ought to have their own launch titles we'll see mm-hmm

1094
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:56,345
[SPEAKER_08]: uh he's saying uh Matt is also saying in chat as Joe and Matt says he also thinks Grand Theft Auto 6 slips into 2026 um wouldn't be surprised wouldn't be surprised would any of us not at this point all right well with that we are going to well let me check in for any last minute stories Loki I don't know if you have anything you want to talk about um I did not okay

1095
01:44:57,216 --> 01:45:25,562
[SPEAKER_08]: then that's it we're going to wrap it all up thank you as always for listening to Orange Launch Radio and being here with us tonight we are the show where every gamer has a voice but remember we need more voices to put out on air so help us spread the word tell a friend or two all that good stuff a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, YouTube wherever it is you found this podcast five star review goes an awful long way and we really appreciate all of that that's it we're going to wrap it up

1096
01:45:26,142 --> 01:45:52,028
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I think you told me earlier you're not going to stream tonight you're going to rest up a little bit but we'll still go to you first for any final thoughts yeah, I have until I figure out what's going on with my work schedule my Sunday night stream, I might start doing a Saturday, not Saturday but earlier in the day on Sunday but but yeah

1097
01:45:55,539 --> 01:45:55,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired.

1098
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:57,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

1099
01:45:57,321 --> 01:45:57,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1100
01:45:57,781 --> 01:45:58,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I get it.

1101
01:45:59,563 --> 01:46:00,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

1102
01:46:02,266 --> 01:46:08,794
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I just finished designing that build, I think, and it's 475,000 blocks at least.

1103
01:46:08,834 --> 01:46:09,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It is my biggest project again.

1104
01:46:15,828 --> 01:46:16,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1105
01:46:17,768 --> 01:46:22,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my final thought is I hope we have a good year ahead for gaming.

1106
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:25,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we hear about less layoffs.

1107
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:33,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we find ourselves back in a good place and have some things to get excited about like a new Switch or whatever Steam Deck decides to go.

1108
01:46:33,852 --> 01:46:35,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we get some things to be excited about again.

1109
01:46:36,052 --> 01:46:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's hope that 2025 is a great year for gaming and that's all I got to say on that.

1110
01:46:43,234 --> 01:46:44,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great week, everybody.

1111
01:46:44,235 --> 01:46:46,357
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

1112
01:46:46,437 --> 01:46:46,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Good night.

1113
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,643
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know they were all still true.

1114
01:47:09,723 --> 01:47:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week.
