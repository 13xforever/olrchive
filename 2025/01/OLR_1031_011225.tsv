9810	20933	Hyperkin has been around since shortly after the era of all third-party accessory manufacturers being known as the little sibling's favorite controller maker, and now they're setting the music game scene on fire with the HyperStrummer, a new guitar for the Nintendo Wii?
21193	28395	Hyperkin is known for its mini retro consoles and accessories, but apparently they're returning to their own roots, updating something that came out around the time their company was established.
28715	29976	New year, new Wii peripheral.
30136	34957	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35197	37378	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39636	42838	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42898	47942	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
48042	56769	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, episode number 1031 of our show for tonight, January the 12th of 2025.
58390	63754	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you each and every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock
64094	65517	Hello, how are you doing tonight?
77113	77533	Oh, pretty good.
77813	82156	I noticed the game that you are having played behind you as we are broadcasting live on Twitch tonight.
82176	83777	You have a little crazy taxi going on.
83837	89640	Is this does this have to do with the whole GameStop Quick Marathon and their little live band running thing that they did?
89720	91981	Oh, I was just tracking my DoorDash order.
92001	92341	That's all.
92381	93622	I'm just watching what's going on.
94369	97231	Oh, here I thought you were making a timely reference.
97551	98152	No, I am.
98632	99933	That's what made me think of it.
100374	100974	Okay, okay.
101594	103016	I saw a little bit of the marathon.
103036	111182	I actually saw when they hit a million during the marathon because they were actually running... Y'all know I love music games and this show exists because of music games.
111502	118027	I wasn't planning on watching the Chunathan run, but I just happened to tune in at the right time and that's when they hit a million dollars.
118067	119188	Have you seen this game, Loki?
119548	120649	The Sega Chunathan?
121049	121389	It's like...
122270	123070	How do I describe it?
123090	127932	Because it's got like a touchpad, so it looks like maybe like a keyboard, but not like an actual like piano keyboard.
128172	138736	So it's got like a little touchpad, but then there's, it actually does like the, and I don't even want to call it para para thing, but it does like where you lift up your hand and there's actually sensors that tell when you lift your hand up.
138796	142818	So you're making these motions where you're like doing this and crosses and all this stuff.
142878	148380	And obviously during a big marathon like that, it's just all the insane shit in that game.
149360	153422	hitting it once in that, which, you know, you can't read those charts.
153742	158825	But I've played, a friend of mine actually has a machine in his house.
158925	163787	And so I've played the smaller, easier levels of that game, but it's fun.
164861	166202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
183092	186156	We're celebrating our affiliate anniversary here at the Voice Geeks Network.
187217	192765	Whatever that means on Twitch, they let you have party hats in your chat on your Twitch affiliate anniversary.
193125	197330	Technically, the channel started in December of 2018.
200134	201075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
220157	229743	So many followers, which thanks to having a presence on Shoutcast and other networks before that, it was pretty easy to hit that relatively fast.
230504	234246	We just had to kind of do a few extra streams like during the week to hit the minimum.
234926	237248	But thanks to all your support, we were able to hit affiliate pretty quick.
237668	241330	But yeah, we're celebrating, I guess, as an affiliate, that would be what?
241951	242631	Seven years?
242991	243612	No, six years?
244092	245093	Six years tonight.
245553	246434	So what is math?
247154	256617	Um, but the reason why I bring all this up is because, you know, when we first made the pivot to video, which is a big learning experience for us because, you know, we were radio for so long.
256657	263500	So we weren't used to things like, you know, looking at the camera or realizing people could see what we were just like completely multitasking and doing other stuff.
263520	265421	You know, we had to get used to some of that type of thing.
265821	268302	And then also just the environment of the studio in the house.
268382	268882	And one of the
269502	269922	and DarkSakura.
292785	293666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
311829	315250	Mr. Smush, we actually rescued at three or four years old.
315530	322813	He was fending for himself in an apartment complex, and that's one of the great questions of my life will always be, what happened to Smush before we found him?
322853	325354	Because I can't believe somebody would let this cat go.
326094	334077	Sure, he had some... I mean, maybe if he was being bred for shows, as a lot of exotics are, he came out a little...
336117	338438	Incorrect, you know, in the genetics department.
338759	340279	But that's what made him adorable.
340399	340960	We loved him.
341500	344121	And, you know, so he was abandoned.
344181	351684	But this was about a month after we had let our cat Sanrio go when she was about 17.
351764	355826	Some of you that have been listening a long, long time might remember hearing of Sanrio, our other cat.
356366	360248	She was 17 and we had to let her go.
360408	361868	And then it was probably about a month.
362328	363469	And then a friend of mine said,
363669	364890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
380945	388769	And I was actually being encouraged at some point to create a Reddit for Mr. Smoosh, but I was like, I don't know what, why would I create a Reddit for my cat?
388789	390070	Like it never really clicked for me.
390110	392971	So I was like, I'll make an Instagram, which probably isn't what they wanted.
393032	397934	But, you know, it allowed them to keep tabs on Mr. Smoosh and all that good stuff.
397954	406699	And of course, we're very thankful being able to, you know, have the cat for as long as we did, which, you know, he was estimated to be about three, four years when we got him.
407219	434369	and then um we had him for seven years and you know he would have been about 10 or 11 and those kidney failure I talked about from last April it just started to get really bad and we noticed especially in the past couple weeks like since the holidays just he was losing a lot of weight he'd already was pretty skinny um he wasn't really eating as much he was just you know and you know how it goes so we took him into the vet and the vet did the labs and said look um it's time
435089	450615	and so we had to do that and obviously it was very very hard but he was able to go in Alan's lap I was right there looking at him when everything happened and that is that so obviously it's you know it's sad thank you and I see I see a lot of love in the chat
451636	457846	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we had a long warning for my cat pixel as well because it didn't make the day or week later any easier.
458126	458927	It's very that.
459528	466098	And actually, I was actually kind of thinking of you and your situation because it was that similar thing where it was kind of like we knew we had one more night.
466579	488919	and that was probably going to be it so you know we were able to like mentally prepare so it it's had a toll on us don't get me wrong I'm holding it together tonight but um it was a lot easier when it wasn't as sudden you know we've had time to sort of mentally prepare that every day really was a gift and thank you as well for all the kind words and chat I really appreciate it yeah we tried to give him the best life we could but he you have to remember this that was our pandemic cat
489520	490321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
514600	515080	and we don't know.
515560	517982	Apparently it's also not every cat will do it.
519244	525309	Alan seems to think that Cheddar could probably smell that things were off with Mr. Smush and maybe has kind of figured it out.
525409	529672	We also kind of know that Cheddar has always been more of an anxious and shy cat and it's really funny.
529732	533516	Y'all didn't really get to see this but Mr. Smush was the one that was a bully.
533976	535397	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
559352	561693	Nothing until that part, at least.
561893	569117	And so we have plenty of months to really dedicate to taking care of a new cat or whatever we decide to do.
569177	569537	We don't know.
569557	573599	We're talking about a lot of options, but obviously it's still hard to think about
575000	576001	A new cat.
576963	578244	Any of you pet owners have been there.
578745	584572	You don't want to replace your pet because your pets can't be replaced, but you want to move on in your heart because there's space in your heart.
584873	589398	So it's all of those emotions we're going through right now and we'll get there, but it'll be a little closer to the end of the month.
589499	590981	Anyway, thank you all for...
592342	596685	Listening to that, I know that's not the most exciting topic in the world, but I wanted to get that off my chest.
597286	608574	And just so all of you are aware, because you all have sent so much love to our cats over the years, not just here on Orange Launch Radio, but in the personal streams that I've done and Alan has done over the years.
609515	611877	If you've watched them, you probably saw the cat at some point.
611957	615440	So just sending all the love right back at y'all.
615460	616040	Thank you so much.
616220	616901	I really appreciate it.
618222	619323	Video games, of course.
619363	620845	That's what we do here at Orange Lounge Radio.
620905	623007	Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
623468	625871	Oops, I didn't address DarkSakura's absence, did I?
625971	628153	I'm sorry, I went right into Mr. Smush.
628193	629775	I forgot to talk about DarkSakura.
630095	632999	Everything's fine, except DarkSakura's just sick tonight.
633339	637664	She wasn't able to make tonight's show, so they're taking the night off to rest up and feel better.
638044	638785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
664204	672229	Everything, because they see that as an opportunity to make more money and have more potential customers that you can approach.
672790	675732	Xbox doesn't necessarily have to be just the Xbox platform.
676932	680975	And so now, there are some... This is a box.
681376	682677	This is a Xbox.
683077	685119	This is... I'm referring to the marketing campaign.
685499	686920	That whole new thing they're trying to do.
687281	690664	Which is... It's weird, but I guess it gets the message across.
690684	691384	I don't think the average buyer...
695948	696488	I really don't.
696608	697709	But anyway, that's another.
697789	698010	No.
698290	699431	And considering.
699711	703073	Yeah, it's I don't think they understand nor care at this point.
703133	711099	Like, I would say the best option for some of that stuff would be like, hey, this is like a Netflix and Netflix can be on everything, you know, like that.
711300	714142	That'd be kind of the way they approach their cloud streaming, I think.
714182	714282	But.
714862	734319	along with that though apparently according to a gaming insider the Halo the Master Chief collection is slated to come to the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 this year that they are already planning on porting that over which that makes sense it's an older game at this point you know so that game's
735040	740246	Not a new game, but it is definitely like an Xbox catalog title.
740286	748956	That would still be the equivalent of Nintendo allowing Zelda Breath of the Wild on PlayStation, which was Snowball's chance in hell, right?
749196	750718	But that's kind of the equivalent.
750758	756284	It's one of their biggest catalog titles, even if it's what, like eight years old at this point, you know?
757222	779114	yeah he says uh so games i have heard that will be released multi-platform in 2025 and beyond uh of course obviously it's going to include flight simulator will come to playstation 5 and switch 2 and then they mentioned the halo master that game needs a second chance as well it botched its original launch that game needs a second chance so good on them i guess
780020	790409	Yeah, and then it says Microsoft will be a big supporter of Nintendo's new system in its first year with other ports as well.
790569	791930	That isn't surprising.
792731	795113	Ori coming out on that.
795954	800457	Sea of Thieves, that was on my predictions list for last year when we thought we'd get the Switch 2 last year.
801018	803280	Sea of Thieves seems like a must for the Switch.
803320	804501	I think that would be such a good title.
804881	806763	Well, they already said, yeah, they're bringing that.
807064	808866	Okay, well, there you go.
809407	819059	So, yeah, so it's... Yeah, not too much of a surprise that they'll be... Yeah, so Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentament, and Grounded were the four.
819379	820641	Okay, that's great.
820661	820741	Okay.
821910	847036	and then of course along with that Microsoft is looking to maybe develop a handheld system and right now it says they are working or you know back in November Phil Spencer had said they are working on a gaming handheld device but it's years out they said I don't know why it's years out when you have the Steam Deck I mean there's lots of iterations coming with that type of thing um
847256	850820	Yeah, I'd be curious what it is they're doing that necessitates a few years of incubation.
850920	857786	That sort of kind of implies that there's some type of tech in there that's not out today or something.
858367	859068	Yeah, I don't know.
859248	863392	I don't know to what extent you do with that, but we'll see when we see.
865477	887089	Apparently, Jason Ronald, who has spoken to The Verge, he is the VP of Next Generation, is after a roundtable called The Future of Gaming Handhelds, where he suggested that Microsoft could create less of a handheld Xbox but more of a handheld PC offering with an Xbox-like experience.
887609	893272	Once again, though, if you're going to spend years to do what the Steam Deck has already done and probably better...
894215	895836	That's just the Windows phone all over again.
897157	898298	Come on, Microsoft.
898738	901980	You gotta step it up if you're gonna be trying to compete in that space.
902441	904702	Which, honestly, I don't think you really should.
904902	917391	Probably you should just get in bed with Steam and Asus or whomever are putting out these handhelds and say, hey, can you put our streaming platform as one of your install apps on there?
918551	921954	Pre-installed in there so you have access to it or something and throw in like
923235	950417	6 months of the service or something like that I think that would be a better value proposition than developing your own handheld which will probably get outdated pretty quick I'm not sure nowadays originally the Surface tablets are pretty nice and I think the Surface laptops are somewhat competitive but I don't know what they are in the current landscape of handheld and tablet devices if there are any
951468	953529	I don't know It'd be interesting to see what comes of that
969144	973425	Yeah, I'm very curious to see where Microsoft's kind of direction takes them this year, too.
973505	978987	Kind of, you know, freeing themselves from just like, you know, a big console manufacturer being that and these other things, too.
979007	979927	It could be very interesting.
980467	982708	I'm going to our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
983268	988390	S2100Matt says, I do think there is a more than 0% chance of a Game Pass app on Switch 2.
989190	990811	I doubt it, but it's not zero.
991011	993511	I'm with you that it's non-zero.
994072	995332	It's not impossible, but...
995472	997934	This is going to be the Nintendo Online type thing.
997974	999736	Well, here's the big problem with that.
999796	1002118	And I think this is the complication.
1002558	1008984	Think about where Game Pass is really successful right now because a lot of games keep disappearing from the app.
1009344	1013027	But Game Pass gets really successful with a lot of indie games and smaller games.
1013487	1017351	The problem is many of those games are also for sale on the Switch.
1018031	1022936	So to have a Game Pass app where you'll be able to play those games by paying Microsoft...
1024236	1027458	to play those games for free kind of actively takes money out of Nintendo's pocket.
1027859	1030040	Now, there could be some type of licensing agreement.
1030160	1035503	I mean, because maybe Microsoft is willing to pay Nintendo a pretty penny because it would attract more Game Pass subscribers.
1035523	1040466	So maybe, you know, maybe Microsoft's open to paying a lot of money to make that happen.
1040566	1043008	And that's why we say it's non-zero, right?
1043688	1051453	Or the other could be that it's just your Game Pass selections on Switch would be limited, which isn't completely...
1052253	1053173	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1069898	1096977	could be very good on Nintendo so like maybe they're selling cloud access only but they don't do local installs of the games so if you want to play the Nintendo games when you're not attached to a wi-fi when you're on the train on a plane on a bus whatever uh you can you can you'll have to download the game from Nintendo's eShop to play the game outside of the cloud I think that could be that could sort of be like maybe that little medium a cloud player on the Switch
1097577	1126140	but we'll see I mean again this is a lot of admittedly a lot of fan wank and speculation we don't have a lot to go off of but we do see certainly Microsoft probably wants to do it I think we all can agree Microsoft wants to do it now the question is is Nintendo gonna what does Nintendo get out of this and if it's that kind of system where it's the cloud only and maybe Nintendo generates some sales or Microsoft pays them a fuck ton of money then Nintendo gets something out of it it'll be interesting
1127544	1131287	It's going to be a fun year with all these announcements.
1131828	1134370	It's just a question of when do we start getting announcements?
1135771	1142236	The Switch 2 and all of that, there was a part of me that expected we might hear about it this last week.
1143200	1149062	I would say if we don't hear about it next week, then that console's not out till the holiday.
1149842	1152383	Like September type of thing.
1152403	1153823	I mean, Nintendo could always surprise me.
1154183	1156024	I might end up eating these words later on.
1156324	1157844	Nintendo runs on their own rules.
1158184	1163446	But I'm just, I'm a little bit surprised Nintendo would not want to have it out for the fiscal year.
1163546	1167327	And I realized their commitment was the announcement will be in the fiscal year.
1169108	1187462	but I'm just a little surprised similar to the original Switch you wouldn't put it out in March like March 1st, March 3rd, whatever to get that launch sales on your books for the fiscal year I'm a little surprised Nintendo wouldn't do that but they must truly feel they are not ready with the games or something
1188331	1194376	No, I mean, I still think that they're going to do it because the Switch has slowed down.
1195156	1199220	I think the sales on that have slowed down pretty massively.
1199800	1206245	I can't imagine that they would just let it sit for another, even another six months beyond where we're like,
1206670	1210152	Picturing it to be like, what else would be coming out?
1210232	1212474	Like, I just can't imagine much of anything.
1212934	1213994	I know.
1214215	1214535	We know.
1215075	1217276	The thing is, we know Prime 4 is coming.
1218577	1219998	Legend C3 is coming.
1220018	1221639	Is it coming, though, for the Switch?
1221699	1224501	Because those pre-orders got canceled.
1224621	1225441	So tech.
1225582	1226482	Oh, I didn't hear about that part.
1226962	1228924	Well, that was just an Amazon thing.
1228944	1229404	A year's old.
1229444	1230204	We'll get to that.
1230304	1230785	But yeah.
1232651	1235053	They really only announced those titles for Switch.
1235173	1241598	We are all assuming, we're making a jump because we know the games will be backwards compatible on Switch 2.
1242318	1253587	We are assuming they will play better, play differently, have something like the Advanced Dungeon in Zelda Oracle Seasons, Oracle Ages, that type of... We are assuming there is... But...
1254147	1255188	Technically, we don't know.
1255748	1259071	And all we know is that Pokemon Legends ZA is Switch.
1260372	1261653	Metroid Prime 4 is Switch.
1261693	1262874	So they do have games.
1263975	1270080	But I, Loki, I too would be very surprised if they try to ride the current Switch wave all the way to holiday.
1270140	1271842	That's just a long wave.
1272462	1273623	That's too long, I think.
1274824	1275265	For what?
1275445	1275605	Like...
1277051	1281714	Nobody in the history of ever has said, oh, the system was delayed too much.
1281754	1282494	I'm not going to buy it.
1283134	1284195	You know, I mean, right.
1284295	1288297	And maybe if I just can't imagine, though, that we're just going to make the software to justify it.
1289018	1289198	Right.
1289218	1289878	We're going to see.
1290238	1295201	I can't imagine that we see all these peripherals and things that are coming out.
1296663	1298245	and they're getting ready for it now.
1298365	1302668	You would think that would be something that they wouldn't get that ready this early.
1303009	1314639	The intensification of the leaks and everything that happened at CES and all that stuff, the intensification of all that is why I'm saying, okay, I would legit be surprised if it's not announced next week.
1315279	1337661	because it's just all the smoke the smoke is smoking and so now it's time to show the fire right I just to have us wait all the way until March at this point for a I don't fucking know summer release or something um that that just would really surprise me with all of the intense leaks and you know stuff about third party stuff that's out there now
1338683	1338983	Yeah.
1339724	1339844	Yeah.
1362691	1367113	The Switch also reinvented the rules completely, so who's to say Nintendo can't invent them again?
1367473	1370754	But the Switch announcement was two weeks after the holidays.
1372414	1380617	And to be fair, just because it is set for maybe the 17th doesn't mean that it can't change.
1380917	1386159	And so they may have heard that data at some point, but who knows?
1386859	1387400	I don't know.
1387620	1388480	We'll wait and see.
1389337	1391442	They'll announce it when they're going to announce it.
1391462	1394711	And it'll be like, oh, wow, that's exactly what we saw.
1395052	1396937	It'll happen when it happens, but...
1397864	1410646	The chance of maybe a midweek VOG Network special covering a sudden press announcement is also non-zero, so stay tuned, folks.
1410846	1425169	And if it does get announced this week, we obviously will spend a lot of time on next week's OLR talking about it, but I can't see where Bobby, myself, and whoever's available the day it's announced hop on a special and hammer it out.
1426089	1426529	And I mean...
1427864	1429085	Not to go too dark here.
1429246	1429806	Here we go.
1429826	1432570	You kind of have to announce it before all hell breaks loose.
1432610	1432930	Oh, no.
1433050	1434312	I was thinking the same thing.
1434892	1441340	It's best to capture that now before all the insane shit just about to happen.
1441540	1445064	If you want to be in the news, you probably should get it out there before January 20th.
1446789	1447810	Just saying, yeah.
1447910	1449311	It's probably safe.
1449591	1450651	You know the other big thing?
1450671	1451732	You know what else?
1451772	1452912	So let's make believe.
1453312	1454013	Trust me, bro.
1454033	1454613	Guy is right.
1454653	1455974	And it's January 17th.
1456574	1462417	Which, by the way, I also agree a Friday announcement makes no sense.
1463497	1470359	If it is that, it's January 17th in Japan, but it's January 16th here.
1471020	1472040	I'll go that far to say it.
1473320	1474721	But again, trust me, bro, right?
1475681	1480663	But I also think the other headline they're going to have to worry about is TikTok's imminent
1481283	1507292	Judgment coming in on if it gets banned for sure or not Because that probably won't come in until later in the week And then everybody's going to know Either TikTok is done or TikTok is going to be around I think if it survives this ban, it's going to be around forever at this point So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens on that front Boy, that's a whole other thing That's a whole other rabbit hole we could go down someday Because all the bullshit that's going on at Meta this week There's a lot of people that are like
1507672	1509434	The fuck are we supposed to do when TikTok goes?
1509454	1510716	We're going to go to Instagram reels?
1510756	1513799	I think the fuck not, after what Zuckerberg's been pulling this week.
1514039	1519125	It's just, everybody, it's Mask Off Mondays.
1519285	1521448	It's starting on January 20th.
1522745	1525208	Take those masks off and do all the hate crimes.
1525788	1528651	Seriously, it's disgusting.
1528711	1530693	And I deleted the Facebook app off my phone.
1531034	1532295	I didn't delete Facebook.
1533016	1533717	I will say this.
1534798	1544228	It's a real reality check on how much we are tied to social media apps in certain ways because you may use Facebook as your third-party login for certain things.
1544608	1545448	Keep that in mind.
1545929	1548150	Be mindful of that if you're going to delete your Facebook.
1548190	1552492	You need to know which apps – and you can see that, I think, through your connected apps on Facebook.
1552532	1556313	Be very mindful if you're going to throw Facebook away, which I wouldn't blame anyone for doing.
1556754	1557634	I think it's a little harder.
1557734	1561616	Like for me, again, so much event – I know what I do here on OLR.
1561696	1565297	I'm able to announce that stuff on Blue Sky and stuff and do fairly well.
1565577	1568339	But like the live event hosting I do, I think a lot of you know I host –
1569079	1572483	I can't just throw it away and lose all that promotion because Zuckerberg is a bitch.
1590071	1592771	But does it have me thinking about, well, what can I do?
1592851	1594412	Can I delete the app off my phone?
1594572	1597513	Yeah, I can do that and just stick to using the web.
1597573	1602694	But I think a lot of us are thinking like fucking LiveJournal came and went.
1602834	1603754	Friendster came and went.
1603814	1608756	And yes, I realize all of these things may exist in some shell of its former self, but you all know what I mean.
1609176	1610176	So LiveJournal came and went.
1610216	1611136	Friendster came and went.
1611517	1612697	MySpace came and went.
1613277	1615618	A lot of these websites came and went.
1615738	1616058	Why?
1617199	1618321	won't Facebook die?
1619783	1624590	And I know the answer has to do with because they buy up their competitions, exactly what's happening in the VR space.
1624910	1630238	They buy up their competition, take it over, and then there's no competition or whatever.
1630338	1632962	But anyway, what I hope happens...
1634548	1635549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1659316	1660777	We have a little extra space tonight.
1661097	1662178	The news is a little bit light.
1662198	1662898	There's only two of us.
1662958	1668321	So I read this article online that was called The Enshitification of Blue Sky That's Incoming.
1668701	1673123	And I felt that this article completely missed how Blue Sky was fucking built.
1673443	1677245	Because it was talking about, at some point, Blue Sky is going to have to make money.
1677545	1679286	And that means they're going to have to sell ads.
1679566	1682488	And everything's going to go to shit, just like it does on every other platform.
1682728	1686250	But to me, that article missed a very key part of Blue Sky.
1686670	1689872	BlueSky was built and founded to get around that.
1690332	1701899	BlueSky is built on something else called the At Protocol, which in theory is a little bit more for what Mastodon is kind of built on, is the Mastodon Protocol and that whole thing.
1702359	1706161	So the way that BlueSky... BlueSky and Mastodon are actually not that unalike.
1706661	1710984	It's just the place that BlueSky succeeded is that BlueSky coming out the gate...
1711304	1715328	kind of set their thing as the default for the app protocol.
1715928	1718670	And, you know, everybody, you know, has their feeds on that.
1718750	1729820	And so it didn't feel like Mastodon where you had to explain what is an instance and all this stuff, you know, and eventually Mastodon finally kind of made that different where in their own app, you default to Mastodon social.
1730480	1732242	But I think they kind of did that too late.
1732322	1734063	Blue Sky already had the narrative at that point.
1734083	1734504	Yeah.
1734764	1737805	Yeah I didn't understand the whole Mastodon thing when I tried to figure it out.
1758590	1761812	A TikTok competitor on that app protocol.
1762493	1764634	It's just, it's a lot easier said than done.
1764774	1768096	I sit here and go, voila, you make TikTok on app protocol.
1768377	1770658	Yeah, bitch, that's going to take years of development.
1770678	1772139	That's not like even Blue Sky.
1772499	1776202	I think everybody knows Blue Sky wasn't really ready for primetime.
1776762	1780445	It's just that it became a thing of necessity for very many people.
1780765	1785328	But everybody knows the problem Blue Sky has right now, such as they don't have the images and the DMs.
1785368	1787850	You can't really have private accounts because
1788710	1791011	App Protocol wasn't built to be that.
1791271	1794751	You have to understand why was App Protocol spun off from Twitter?
1795151	1801293	Because Twitter was getting these government notices and the government takedowns and they were supposed to be hiding things from the government.
1801653	1811855	And the whole reason why Jack funded this App Protocol and Blue Sky thing in the first place was that they wanted a social media system that truly lived in the cloud so that nobody could ever shut it down.
1812918	1813879	And that's the whole thing.
1813899	1821724	When they talk about, oh, Blue Sky is going to go to shit because it's going to have ads and all of this stuff, the main Blue Sky client might.
1822104	1822805	But guess what?
1823025	1825086	App Protocol was built to be portable.
1825487	1828789	You would be able to move your account from one place to another just like that.
1828869	1834373	And all of your posts, all of your identity and all of that would move with you because Blue Sky doesn't own it.
1834853	1835894	It's the App Protocol in the cloud.
1836174	1837315	That is my understanding of it.
1837375	1841157	I'm sure some of you that are more into following this than I am will –
1842518	1854164	Correct me on a few things, but I think generally my point is Blue Sky is set up in a different way because it's set up to be Elon Musk proof, essentially.
1854524	1860107	Nobody can come in and buy, well, you could buy Blue Sky, but you can't buy App Protocol.
1860707	1861367	That's the difference.
1862628	1870252	So if a shitlord came in and bought Blue Sky and we all decided we're over it, we'd pack up and move to another App Protocol instance.
1872068	1873889	That's what makes Blue Sky at its core different.
1874710	1879172	And that could also go for, you know, I'm sorry, very long-winded, but how to get around this TikTok ban.
1879592	1884715	If there was a TikTok or an Instagram competitor that was built on app protocol, then same thing.
1885015	1890558	You would be able to have those posts and move them with you and it would live somewhere else and all of that.
1890658	1890958	So it's...
1892608	1894350	We'll see what develops in that whole thing.
1895691	1896031	Let's see.
1896752	1900975	I'm looking at chat here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1902396	1906820	Tiger Class says, Blue Sky right now seems to have a bot problem because you get followed by a lot of these bot accounts.
1907120	1914607	That's a perfect example of the problem they're having right now where they're growing and maybe they weren't ready for primetime, but they kind of had to be.
1915334	1931108	and you see if you follow one of the developers there's actually custom feeds again the best part of Blue Sky there is a Blue Sky team custom feed I'm actually not sure if Paul Frazzi is on there but he's like the chief technical officer and if you actually look at his account which I think is pfrazzi.com somebody in chat will post it
1932009	1934330	But he actually posts updates.
1934430	1935851	He's very transparent with that type of thing.
1936111	1937511	And he's got a sense of humor.
1937751	1940292	He's, I think, a millennial that has that kind of sense of humor.
1940352	1945474	He was making updates like, I think we've won the battle against the bots, but we haven't won the war just yet.
1945494	1946515	We're still working on it.
1946855	1947655	So they're trying.
1947695	1949556	But Blue Sky is literally a team of 20 people.
1951574	1976517	and yeah and at least with the bots so you can just block them and that's it it's annoying but it's not ultimately harming you you know no and usually when I see new followers like I will go and look at their profile and see oh yeah this one look it it's made to look like somebody that's you know has a GoFundMe and they're begging for nope bye you know sorry you know it's just
1977758	1980320	Here's what Blue Sky did do as a short-term fix.
1980561	1990150	If you get annoyed by those follower notifications and all that stuff, you may not know it, but in your notifications tab on Blue Sky, there is a second tab now that only shows you replies.
1990530	1992412	So it filters out all the follow notices.
1992772	1997157	So if you are getting annoyed by the PornBot follow notices, just default to your replies tab.
1997737	2000880	Now, unfortunately, you won't see real people that follow you, so that is kind of a...
2001741	2010553	you know, Slippery Slope but it might at least maybe until they win the battle against the bots then maybe hopefully that'll all you know, filter out but we'll see we'll see so
2011485	2015607	Okay, anyway, sorry for the tangent, but let's be real.
2015667	2019628	You might say, Rob, you spent 15 minutes talking about something that has nothing to do with video games.
2020408	2022269	But this is video game culture.
2022369	2024050	This is video game announcements.
2024110	2028392	This is how news is going to spread about the Switch 2 and future platforms.
2028452	2031773	Social media is fucking important on how games live or die.
2032694	2034275	How do games go viral?
2034375	2037659	How does a Minecraft get the traction that it does?
2037739	2040042	How does a Five Nights at Freddy's?
2040743	2043666	You know the new one that's going viral, at least on my TikTok feed?
2044287	2045588	Fuck, I can't remember the name of it.
2046229	2047651	Somebody in chat hopefully knows the name.
2047691	2048832	Again, I'm sorry to always rely on chat.
2048852	2049393	Garden of Banban?
2049913	2057839	No, it's the one, okay, it's the, it's a survival horror game, but you play a child and it's the parents that are mad at you.
2057859	2059740	They're pissed at you because you got an F in something.
2060061	2066085	And they're like, they, they, no, yeah, they're like, you're hiding in the closet and the parents like, I told you to clean your room.
2066425	2069908	It's, it's actually like, it can be super triggering for some people, I'm sure.
2070468	2074131	But, um, that's, I kind of think what makes the game sort of brilliant.
2075692	2093739	uh kind of damn it i wish i knew the name of the game i thought it was school boy something uh survival horror game parents what was the name of this disturbing horrible game where you have again yes this is it school boy sorry i'm bringing up a youtube uh school boy run away that's the game
2095031	2114237	that game looks fucking psycho so I that that's and that's at least on my TikTok maybe it's because I've watched one too many videos on it right now because there's like an ending that is can I can I talk about the ending I'm gonna because I've seen on TikTok if you don't want to hear about the ending to this game then fast forward a minute
2115353	2139256	there's a sequence in the basement you get teleported so when you get far enough from the house and you get teleported you get teleported randomly to this basement in this home and then you see as you're walking around you're like why am I here randomly and you see this giant squid monster and as soon as the squid monster sees you you hear the boy cry out mommy and it's like really disturbing and then the squid monster chases you and kills you
2140587	2161894	and it's this whole very like it was Cthulhu all along but it's this whole fucked up thing where it was like even though he was running away from her he called out her name in the end and it's like one of those like oh my god this game is like fucked beyond belief so anyway that's just that game like totally caught my attention I was like ooh this is wild so yeah
2163054	2178304	but yeah it's things like that that you know again I would not know of that game if it wasn't for TikTok and social media and that whole type of thing so Bobby Blackwolf says it didn't go viral enough because you don't remember the game I remember the game I just don't remember the name and that's my that's an age problem
2182492	2187816	Alright, let's get into a segment we do pretty regularly here on the show called How Was Your Gaming Week?
2188096	2191358	And we're going to talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2192179	2193220	Loki, I'm going to start off with you.
2194229	2200215	Well, this week has been rebuilding, basically building the whole water ride on our survival server.
2200275	2209463	So like a lot of times what I'll do with stuff is I design it on our creative server because it allows me to iterate much faster over the course of however long.
2209503	2213567	And then, of course, we recreate it in survival after I've gathered all the blocks.
2213587	2215969	So it was a half a million block build.
2217090	2238563	um and I'm still adding details to it but like I really hustled to get that all done because once again in the season already um pretty much to the end of this month is when I have to have everything done in the build which it's getting there it's it's almost there I'm just adding more details I'm probably going to finish up um this last section of the park that
2239183	2240004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2259446	2260086	and DarkSakura.
2285181	2295250	had commissioned music from a guy on Fiverr for the ride, but it just doesn't fit at all.
2296871	2304777	I feel that even though he said English fluent, he just wasn't quite 100% English fluent and just was confused by what I wanted.
2304958	2308861	It's a good country song, or two country songs, but it's not what I asked for.
2310322	2312043	But I'll reuse those later on.
2312104	2312964	I did find some...
2314229	2319412	Funny enough, in the YouTube Music Library, some banjo music that works perfectly for what I wanted to do.
2320052	2321233	And that would have cost me nothing.
2321793	2331239	So yeah, I'm hoping to get this all done, and hopefully get... I mean, I'm trying to get... I originally was going to plan on doing two more episodes, but it's probably just going to get lumped in the one.
2331699	2332960	One and done, and that's it.
2333400	2336602	No, I'm not even sure if I'm going to do a story finale.
2336642	2339504	I kind of touched story a little bit this season, but...
2340814	2352500	Honestly, I'm too busy to do it right now, and if I spent the time I did last season on the finale, I mean, that took a month alone just to do that, and I don't want to do that again.
2352761	2354442	I don't want to put myself through that stress.
2354542	2354962	It's just...
2356024	2356464	Not worth it.
2356605	2370157	But on the upside, though, this creator, Minecraft creator, goes by NewCurry, put out a top SMP worlds, or top worlds of 2024 list, and our server was number one.
2370477	2371418	So that was nice.
2372479	2373920	We made a top list.
2374661	2381087	It's not a huge sizable creator, like 15,000 subs or whatever, but still nice to be shouted out again.
2381827	2382087	Great.
2382308	2382608	Good for you.
2383939	2384739	All right, Mike.
2385000	2386380	Oh, and now Bolaltro, of course.
2386741	2387281	Of course, of course.
2388101	2391383	My gaming week was a little slower because of everything I talked about at the beginning of the show.
2391423	2395085	You can understand games were not at the front of my mind, but I was able to play a little bit.
2395485	2399607	I hung out with a friend last night, and we were playing with Steam Decks in the same room.
2399627	2404170	We were like, oh, we can play like a multiplayer game on our Steam Decks, and we played Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
2404350	2407271	We were trying to look at what games do we both own that we could play.
2407612	2410073	So we were actually playing that game, which, God...
2410834	2417679	I just want to remind you, in case you forgot, which I don't think you maybe did, but just in case you forgot, the soundtrack to that game is so fucking good.
2418740	2427868	Go do yourself a favor and go listen to the Anamanaguchi music for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, because it's so, so good, and probably the best part of that game, because
2428368	2433572	That game kind of annoys me how the NPCs will kind of hang on the very side of the screen.
2433973	2436655	They kind of do too much of that thing from the arcade.
2436695	2437215	But it's fun.
2437256	2439137	It was fun to play in the same room.
2439177	2440778	And I was playing a few other Steam Deck games.
2440798	2443441	I was playing Pac-Man Championship Edition and things like that.
2443861	2446443	And I also played a little bit of World of Warcraft.
2446844	2449426	I'm actually kind of finding my vibe in that game again.
2450086	2454430	I still love Final Fantasy XIV, but there's really nothing for me in that game right now.
2454450	2455351	I'm really waiting for...
2455891	2458433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2473566	2475127	The War Within expansion is pretty good.
2475167	2476228	The game's in a decent place.
2476308	2480590	I really like the whole delve thing where you can do these dungeon-type experiences basically by yourself.
2481311	2482971	I think they did a good job with it.
2483052	2489575	And there's many different ways to gear up and feel like you're getting some of the best gear in the game without necessarily being an endgame raider.
2489935	2496559	I mean, you can get it really fast doing that and you get really, really good stuff, but you still feel progression doing other stuff too, which is pretty cool.
2497660	2498380	That's really it.
2498520	2501262	I don't know if I can really think of anything else during my gaming week, so...
2502302	2520864	unfortunately I still need to beat the Guardian Legend I'd hope to play that I was going to do it Tuesday night but everything else started happening so it is what it is I'll hopefully get to that this week and finishing the Guardian Legend and get on some other retro games too so all right let's get into some more gaming news Loki is gonna kick us off
2522014	2526137	Yes, we kind of alluded to it earlier when we were talking about the Switch 2 at CES.
2526437	2529199	The course had more Switch 2 leaks, I guess.
2530580	2536745	Those, of course, one of the major ones was from, I guess, Genki.
2537005	2546232	It was a third-party peripheral company who had some 3D models of a Switch system and had, you know...
2547284	2553729	I think they had a 3D video that were kind of showing how the Joy-Cons interacted with the console and whatnot.
2556671	2565497	But yeah, and along with that, not only were there leaks from that, but there's also leaks from GameStop as well, because guess what?
2566498	2575164	The Switch 2 SKU, it's in their system now, in their POS, so obviously it's coming.
2576831	2578152	So we'll have to see.
2580034	2580374	I'm sorry.
2580734	2581915	These aren't actually for the system.
2581935	2584998	This is for micro SD cards that are branded for Switch 2.
2585158	2589061	So that is something that's coming as well as more peripheral things.
2589081	2590702	It's all that smoke I was referring to earlier.
2590782	2596346	It's just intensifying too much for there not to be a relatively imminent announcement.
2596466	2597067	But again...
2598408	2624664	I'm not willing to bet money on it because nothing Nintendo does in the delay department and all that surprises me anymore and ultimately at the end of the day we're all still going to buy one if we can afford it now Nintendo has come out to comment on this though but what they commented was very vague in the sense that the gaming hardware that Genki is claiming to be the Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by Nintendo and
2628004	2632190	Right, but they have to make their accessories by specs.
2632250	2636695	They're not going to just make accessories for something that does not exist.
2636755	2642623	Like, I'm going to make an accessory for this fictional Atari console that's never going to be out.
2642643	2643224	Like, you know...
2643784	2649289	The rabble rabble of this thing, especially being at a trade show, and that's the key difference.
2649829	2662199	When people are doing these Nintendo rumors and shit on X and other social media, Nintendo just can go, well, the internet is internetting and it's the internet's – it's very easy to log on and lie, right?
2662219	2662739	Yeah.
2662819	2674343	But it's different when you are paying for a booth at the largest electronic trade show, I think, in the world, maybe in the country at least, and you're actively advertising these peripherals.
2674363	2678044	Like, Nintendo is sort of back to a quarter to comment in a different way.
2678204	2678444	Yeah.
2679304	2680384	Yeah, someone gave them the specs.
2680404	2685346	They aren't just, like, creating these peripherals out of thin air because they, like, think this is what it might look like.
2686505	2705636	you work with these companies and like I get it that you can't just say oh yes it's not a real switch that they had right it was a 3D mock-up that basically is the same size and shape it's just you have to have something to show how the peripherals go together they are taking a really big gamble
2705996	2730577	that their leak is correct so they can be first and by being at this trade show and getting in front of you know stores and things like that they want to be the peripherals that are on the shelves before everybody else rolls back their official announcements and since I am assuming this company is not under any sort of NDA with Nintendo because if they were holy shit that would be a problem that they don't have to wait that this whole thing is hedging their bets that this intel is right
2730957	2733778	so they can be first and get the shelf space commitment.
2734138	2734879	That is what it is.
2735519	2740641	I know there's a lot of talk about, oh, they just want to get their name out there, which is also working, let's be real.
2741341	2742541	But it's the shelf space.
2743922	2746483	It's a huge bet that their intel is good.
2747383	2748384	It's going to be right.
2748404	2748744	We'll see.
2751363	2753425	All right, moving on.
2753485	2758308	I'm sure you all are excited about Switch 2, but we don't have a lot more to say until they officially unveil it.
2758648	2762911	So let's talk a little bit about the Xbox Rewards Program.
2763272	2764393	You're grinning over there, Loki.
2765914	2767695	Oh, nothing.
2769216	2778543	I keep getting bugged by Xbox and the Rewards Program because every time I play Minecraft, apparently it's been accruing points for me on my account.
2778563	2778603	Oh.
2779713	2794490	and I haven't looked at it for years so I've got like a ton of stuff on there I guess for like a month of ultimate game passes and you can add it to your current subscriptions you just don't pay for a game pass for a month yeah spend those points don't let them go to waste
2795231	2798832	Yeah, so okay, well, if you have points or what have you.
2798932	2809555	So Microsoft made changes that weren't so popular to its rewards program, I want to say the middle of last year, but now we're getting kind of some revamps that I think are going to help some people out.
2809675	2816037	So, you know, when you log on and play Xbox games, as Loki does a lot with Minecraft, you get reward points.
2817177	2818838	And then hopefully you're claiming that.
2818858	2820138	I don't know if they're automatically credited.
2820158	2821299	You might have to claim them, Loki.
2821319	2821999	That might be a problem.
2822039	2822339	But anyway...
2823259	2824160	No, it's claimed.
2824180	2828022	I mean, obviously with the number of points I have, it's claimed, I think.
2829903	2831043	How many points?
2831184	2831604	Now I'm nosy.
2831784	2832424	Let me check.
2835806	2836526	Xbox.
2836907	2837547	So curious.
2838187	2839968	I have to know this before we move on with the story.
2840889	2841609	Hold on, hold on.
2843790	2844691	Where do I see the points?
2846034	2852837	Mine, when I'm logged into Windows, I can see it right in the... Oh, if you go to Microsoft Edge, it comes right up, I think.
2853917	2854298	Oh, Edge.
2855878	2856979	Let's see here.
2859291	2861832	While you're figuring it out, let me finish the story here.
2862212	2869514	Okay, so Microsoft did announce some changes to the program, including Game Pass Quest for PC.
2869674	2874956	So that's the big sort of thing there is that now when you play games on PC, you will be able to get credit as well.
2875216	2877556	And weekly point streaks are coming back.
2877656	2879737	So another way to earn more points.
2880157	2882118	Game Pass quests on consoles are reimagined
2906815	2908496	So you just have to play for 15 minutes.
2908696	2912197	So you can't just log into the game and log off as some people were doing before.
2912918	2916439	But you can get rewards for playing different Game Pass titles.
2916619	2919460	So if you mix it up a little bit, you have to play more than just Minecraft, Loki.
2920681	2924742	Okay, so it says I have, I don't know if some of the stuff's expired or not, but it's 9,530.
2926465	2942840	that's actually not as many points as you think it's a decent amount but one month of ultimate is 13,000 points so it's not quite as many as you think I think some stuff's been expiring they kept sending me messages you better use them I'm like that could be but just get in there and cash out once in a while because you might you know
2944381	2945842	You might be able to get some deals.
2945942	2952265	Anyway, I think you can get Minecraft Shop gift cards too in there, which might be things that... Oh, don't play that.
2952746	2953226	No, I'm not.
2953506	2954707	I'm completely serious.
2954747	2957528	I'm almost positive you can redeem points for a Minecraft card, so do it.
2959509	2986086	anyway or a Roblox card for the kid I think is in there too anyway yeah so this is changes to the reward programs good stuff if you are an Xbox gamer and yeah I think just a reminder they do have that I mean it takes a while to earn points but hey if you're accumulating the points like Loki is turn them in get yourself I mean with the 9,000 points Loki you can probably get at least a $10 Minecraft card which you know doesn't sound like a lot but $10 is $10 it can
2988147	2991229	Yeah, I just don't play Bedrock, so I would never use this.
2991389	2992950	Well, let's see what else is there.
2994250	2997332	Anyway, that's some changes to the program, and I think they're going to be welcomed by a lot of folks.
2997952	3002895	Let's move on to this interesting story, Loki, about a game we used to talk a lot about.
3003355	3006677	Peripherals for consoles that are gone?
3007297	3016542	We were playing the Wii for a while recently, but now there's going to be a brand new Guitar Hero controller released for the Wii.
3017563	3019203	this year from Hyperkin.
3019844	3032726	And it is, of course, you know, like the original Wii Guitar Hero controllers, you pop in the Wii Remote and it is compatible with both Guitar Hero and Rock Band games.
3034587	3035827	Don't know why you would need that.
3035927	3043969	I guess if you really can't find any of these peripherals at your local, like, thrift store because they have mountains of them.
3044549	3044649	Um...
3046613	3047673	It looks nice.
3048073	3055175	I'm surprised this is more for the Wii and not the PC, considering Fortnite, the music stuff.
3055235	3059396	I thought that they had some tie-in with that type of thing.
3059476	3064437	It's not in our show role, but speaking of that, Fortnite is bringing that mode to the same room now.
3064537	3065957	That's a big upgrade.
3065997	3069678	I don't know if you know, but Fortnite Festival can only be played online right now, multiplayer.
3069938	3073679	They're going to make it so that you have the same room, so you can essentially have rock band parties again.
3074559	3080364	Right, so why wouldn't you do that for PC or like for like current consoles?
3080424	3081925	Fortnite did team up.
3081945	3085628	There are official Fortnite festival peripherals for that for PC.
3085948	3086629	So there is that.
3087489	3090832	OrangeRite also points out in chat, there's also good Wii to PC adapters and so forth.
3091232	3092633	You know what I think it is, Loki?
3092713	3094253	I kind of had a chuckle at this story, too.
3094313	3095934	Like, who's going to buy this for the Wii?
3096654	3106158	I actually think with all the retro gaming stuff and retro gaming's popularity, I actually think there is an audience for people looking for peripherals for old systems.
3106198	3108979	Like you said, you fired up the Wii not that long ago.
3109199	3109839	Well, here's the thing.
3110279	3134225	like think about it like let's just like think about this so yeah like the Wii and stuff it's not there's a lot of games on the Wii like there's a lot of games that probably aren't worth I don't know what Guitar Hero is necessarily worth on the second-hand market probably not a lot um Guitar Hero it's like the Wii itself I'm not really sure how valuable that is because there were a lot of Wiis out there um
3135646	3153832	But maybe with all of these, all this inflation in price and all these sanctions on other companies and our laptops supposed to be going up 68% in price and game consoles skyrocketing because of all these tariffs.
3155615	3156776	Maybe the Wii is going to come back.
3157217	3160840	Maybe used gaming is a more popular market.
3160960	3163242	Now that you're saying this, what's the patent?
3163722	3164082	I'm sorry.
3164363	3165163	Yeah, patent.
3165203	3168466	What's the timeframe on patent expiration for hardware?
3169107	3173310	Hence why we get all these Super Nintendo Genesis things that come out later.
3173350	3173991	20 years, I think.
3174011	3176173	Well, guess what turns 20 years old next year?
3178595	3181057	That could be part of the reason why, I wonder.
3181311	3186238	Well, I think Guitar Hero for the Wii, it was originally back in 2009, it says.
3186438	3191044	Yeah, but the Wii hardware itself is going to be 20 years old next year.
3191425	3192766	And so if you have... Bring it back!
3192866	3193307	Exactly.
3193327	3196011	If you have a copy of Guitar Hero floating around or what have you...
3196812	3197973	Now you'll have a controller for that.
3198493	3210886	Because I'm sure because of exactly all those things you said that the software is everywhere and it's that whole thing that once the patents are up on the Wii and third parties can make their own versions of the Wii it's going to happen.
3211006	3211267	But
3212560	3220331	I say that and I also kind of go, have we seen that happen with the GameCube or the PlayStation 2 or some of those other things?
3220391	3224838	I don't know, but they did explain why they are putting this out.
3224918	3228864	It says, we want to take a moment to thank our community for the passionate discussion surrounding...
3229324	3230565	Our latest product launch.
3230665	3241769	The new HyperStormer was developed to meet the demand for an accessible and budget-friendly solution perfect for retro gamers who want to enter the guitar scene in 2025 at an affordable price.
3242129	3246131	While we understand this is not what some fans were expecting, you can rest assured that this is just the beginning.
3247291	3248272	It says we have...
3249946	3255669	We've had fans struggling for years to buy used, potentially non-functional peripherals for hundreds of dollars online.
3255789	3263874	While it is correct this is the same shell mold from a previous Hyperkin release from 2009, that's all it is.
3263994	3268236	We used the mold to make brand new shells, fitting it with 2024 internal components.
3268337	3272039	This is not old school, nor is it old guitars I've been seeing in a warehouse.
3272679	3275261	We are creating something new and it's really groundbreaking.
3275321	3277604	Okay, groundbreaking is probably a bit of a stretch.
3277764	3284970	I can see the whole, hey, we see the secondhand market where these are going for hundreds of dollars and we'd rather make that money.
3285611	3286952	I can see that.
3287212	3289454	Or that, yeah.
3289474	3290475	Whatever, you know what?
3290836	3291977	They can do whatever they want.
3292918	3298463	If they want to make a brand new controller for an old system, by golly, they can do it.
3301311	3302391	I'm still kind of curious.
3302491	3306194	Maybe it has to do with disc versus cartridge.
3306834	3310537	Have we seen the third-party PlayStations and PlayStation 2s?
3310677	3311638	I don't think we have.
3312138	3315360	It's probably because of the BIOS in those systems.
3315460	3316981	I bet that's what the key difference is.
3317001	3323426	You can do the cartridges because you didn't have a system BIOS in that whole thing, whereas these newer ones you did.
3323786	3327088	I bet maybe I just kind of talked myself out of my earlier theory.
3329010	3329450	Interesting.
3330182	3350555	Well, that said, though, they have disc-based systems that play that stuff, FPGA stuff, because I want to say that they had a really expensive CD thing through, oh, who's that that does all the really expensive retro consoles?
3350635	3351576	Limited run games?
3352136	3353137	Or Retron?
3353217	3353977	Not Retron.
3354117	3355418	No, I don't think it's Retron.
3355538	3357960	It's the same company, Hyperkin, isn't it?
3359178	3360239	No, it's not Retron.
3360479	3362500	It is... Evercade.
3362580	3363161	I don't know.
3363461	3365802	It's certainly not Evercade.
3367724	3368504	Let's see...
3371566	3376032	Bobby in chat is talking about the way the electronics... Analog.
3376453	3377334	It's analog.
3377554	3378535	Oh, yeah, they always sell it.
3378555	3383782	Because they had an analog CD system, I thought, or they were working on one.
3384022	3389649	I think they had one, so I don't know how that works unless you've got to get the keys before you can play that, but...
3390330	3408596	Trobo4 in chat gets a gold star for reading your mind they got it Bobby Blackwolf also says the electronics are in the Wii remote they don't have to make the electronic part that talks to the console on the Wii the Wii remote does it and that electronic part requires getting a license but you don't need a license to make a mold that takes in the Wii remote that's kind of interesting
3410134	3415218	That's right, didn't the Wii remote kind of slip into the guitar's front so it could sense the tilting of the guitar?
3416339	3422985	Well, yeah, it also just, it was essentially used for the wireless communication as well.
3423005	3424626	Yeah, well, everything, yeah, let's just be said.
3424646	3425206	Yeah, interesting.
3426528	3427608	All right, well, you know what?
3427648	3430351	For all of you still rocking out to Guitar Hero on the Wii, good news.
3431189	3456186	but I could see where people are like let's bust it out for a party like when you know all the 40 year olds like when we were 21 let's play this game again I've still got all my Rock Band 2 stuff I don't know I think the only thing that I'm kind of iffy on is whether I still have that dumped to a hard drive on my Xbox 360 which is in a case somewhere but I still have all of my guitars and stuff in the garage
3457742	3475209	my drum set's in a bag I bought the official rock band drum set bag to put the drum set in and I got all the I had everything for that and I played it almost never alright well speaking of retro goodness and stuff to inspire that Loki what else do you have?
3476812	3484578	Alright, so then we also have some word about a brand new LEGO set coming out because I'm always excited about that.
3484718	3489822	I've got my LEGO NES on top of my computer right here with that wonderful TV.
3490262	3496066	Well, Nintendo has come out and confirmed that there is a LEGO Game Boy coming in October.
3496627	3497948	And that's all we know.
3498168	3501310	We don't know what it's going to look like, how much it's going to be.
3501870	3504773	All we know is it's going to be coming out.
3508240	3524292	I can't wait for somebody to mod it to give it a backlight or one of those tacky little clip-on lights that we all had to use to play it in the car at night when we were younger.
3524932	3526614	Some type of Lego clip-on light.
3528154	3536045	But yeah, it says built for the classic Nintendo system in LEGO form coming October 2025.
3537227	3538629	And that was from Nintendo.
3540322	3548386	I wonder if it's just this Game Boy or if they're going to be doing sets based off of that.
3548406	3555729	Because the Game Boy itself, assuming that you make it to scale, which is what I've got my Nintendo system, it's not that big.
3556030	3557070	It's pretty small.
3557670	3562793	So I don't know if they would be doing more than just the Game Boy with that.
3563153	3563233	Hmm.
3565857	3566218	We'll see.
3566258	3567139	We'll wait and see.
3567699	3568000	All right.
3568660	3572364	Well, let's move on to a classic game getting rebooted.
3572525	3575047	I didn't know about this, and this is kind of neat that this is coming.
3575448	3580213	But Carmen Sandiego from the game Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
3580233	3582436	And then, of course, there was Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?
3582476	3583277	Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?
3583317	3584518	The many Netflix series.
3584538	3585579	The Netflix show.
3586480	3589242	The Game Show, we all know the, you know, Rockefeller.
3589782	3594365	Oh man, that's the game I want to play in Rock Band on the Wii.
3594665	3597227	All right, anyway, Carmen Sandiego is coming back.
3597707	3601410	It was announced by the developer Gameloft that Carmen Sandiego is going to launch for PS5.
3602350	3607474	Xbox Series, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, PC on Steam, and iOS and Android.
3607774	3608735	So it's even a mobile game.
3608815	3609676	It is going everywhere.
3610016	3617362	You will be able to get this game for $29.99 for the Standard Edition or $50, $49.99 for the Deluxe Edition.
3617402	3618703	But if you pre-order it, you can get it for $39.99.
3620144	3623607	There will be a physical version in mid-April for PS5 and Switch.
3624727	3627469	It's called the 40th Anniversary Edition, which is also priced at $49.99.
3628710	3632392	This is where parts get ridiculous because I'm like, it's fucking Carmen Sandiego.
3632692	3640617	The Deluxe Edition has an anniversary caper, two cosmetic skins, a digital official soundtrack, and a digital art book.
3641018	3641518	And it's like...
3642078	3643419	It sounds like a bunch of garbage.
3643499	3648462	And I hate the idea of cosmetic skins for fucking Carmen Sandiego.
3648782	3649542	Come on.
3650183	3650863	Come on.
3650903	3652784	But I guess you don't have to have it, so whatever.
3653144	3655926	But this is the part that annoys me about gaming today, as I'm sure a lot of you.
3656626	3658327	So anyway, the regular version of the game.
3659247	3659787	will be out.
3660027	3663228	And what do you do in this game?
3663449	3668590	You're chasing Vile, the enemy organization.
3668890	3677893	Whether you're a rookie gumshoe or a seasoned detective, you are playing either the main campaign or what they call the Acme Files, which is a classic mode.
3678313	3679433	And that's kind of cool with that.
3680314	3680474	So...
3681554	3685496	Anyway, in the game, you're actually playing Carmen Sandiego herself.
3686056	3692159	And so you actually are trying to outwit vile operations to outwit them, I guess.
3692979	3699682	You get new tools, you gear up, you travel the globe to different areas, marketing talk, publicity talk.
3700042	3705505	But isn't it neat that this thing from our youth is being put out all over again in regular and limited editions?
3708246	3710288	Weren't you supposed to be catching Carmen Sandiego?
3710348	3712790	Why are you playing Carmen Sandiego?
3712930	3713851	They're flipping the script.
3714972	3717914	At one point, they said, what if you were the ghost in Pac-Man?
3718935	3721477	Pac-Man Versus came out, and it was probably the best one in the series.
3721598	3724320	So, you know, sometimes they flip the script a little.
3725501	3727382	What if Pac-Man was a horror series?
3727543	3728884	Oh, we've got that now, too.
3729504	3730745	Well, you just talked about the Game Boy.
3730785	3732127	What about Wario Land?
3732167	3732567	Hello?
3732787	3733368	Wario where?
3733388	3733588	Wario Land.
3735209	3736350	We need more Wario games.
3736870	3739151	WarioWare Shake, it was fantastic.
3739271	3741672	That needs to be put on modern consoles.
3741852	3743913	Yes.
3744393	3747954	Or make a Mario game like that that's all hand-drawn and animated.
3748295	3748715	That was...
3749847	3750828	Amazing.
3751048	3760354	I think another thing to give you a serious answer on the why are you playing as Carmen Sandiego front, I think because for this generation, they've kind of turned her into the hero.
3760434	3763816	Because if I remember right, the Netflix series, she was the star.
3763916	3765677	It wasn't about catching Carmen Sandiego.
3765697	3767338	It was about following Carmen Sandiego.
3767758	3772381	So at some point in the last 10 years, the narrative on the whole series flipped.
3773081	3776984	I mean, in the game show, you were trying to catch Carmen Sandiego, but kids don't remember that.
3777124	3777384	I know.
3777444	3777704	We all...
3779145	3783210	Nothing is ever going to top the game show and watching a kid not be able to label all the countries correctly.
3783230	3784051	Well, the game show, too.
3784091	3789337	No, the game show is good, but I'm talking about the old original cartoon that they had as well where they were chasing Carmageddon in San Diego.
3789357	3790298	Oh, yeah, that was so long ago.
3791159	3791980	So long ago.
3792761	3792981	All right.
3793001	3793441	That's right.
3794062	3794543	and DarkSakura.com.
3811005	3818209	Some of these rumors and leaks and things that are from respected sources are looking to shake up the Dead by Daylight game.
3818889	3820490	2v8 is set to return.
3820610	3823451	We know that 2v8 has been very popular in the game.
3823832	3825873	The game is typically four on one.
3827006	3831790	But now it's going to be 2v8 in a special mode, as we've seen a couple of times.
3832151	3835253	And it looks like Resident Evil is going to be involved in this return.
3835834	3839997	Some other things we already know that have been confirmed for Dead by Daylight over the next few months.
3840358	3843460	We know Five Nights at Freddy's, that collaboration is coming.
3843780	3844841	That was confirmed.
3845262	3847764	Apparently there is an anniversary chapter coming.
3848204	3851887	The leaks are saying, take it with a grain of salt, but the leaks are saying...
3852836	3853837	I can't fucking believe this.
3854417	3856779	Jurassic World is the crossover.
3857439	3859981	So are they going to put dinosaurs in Dead by Daylight?
3860962	3862783	Do you get to play as a velociraptor?
3863323	3865024	It sounds like you damn well might be.
3865184	3867086	Or maybe at least you get to play some of the heroes.
3867546	3876152	Honestly, if I can be Jonathan Bailey, who's starring in the new trilogy, if I can be Jonathan Bailey in Dead by Daylight, yes.
3876752	3877253	Period.
3877413	3878133	End of sentence.
3879074	3879414	Done.
3879794	3880155	Okay?
3881035	3881796	Jonathan Bailey...
3883291	3883892	is hot.
3884492	3885713	That's all I'm going to say.
3887374	3893760	So if I can play as him in Dead by Daylight and maybe it's just a survivor thing, but if I can play as a dinosaur too, I think that's really fucking funny.
3894300	3901266	And look, Dead by Daylight has all sorts of spirits and ghouls and the Demi Gorgon from Stranger Things.
3901706	3903968	So it's not like, you know, and the...
3904969	3906650	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3925754	3929337	Apparently the new 2v8 mode is looking to be Resident Evil themed.
3929677	3936582	This is coming from some leaks not only on X from sources that tend to get these things right, but a Discord based on DBD leaks.
3936963	3939184	So it looks like the 2v8 may be Resident Evil themed.
3939505	3943107	Apparently there may be some more Resident Evil content coming as well.
3943167	3945849	Some folks are theorizing, as usual, that...
3947511	3951456	Lady Dimitrescu may come out but she might come out as a legendary skin.
3951836	3959185	So for those that don't know there are legendary skins that will transform existing characters with existing movesets and everything into something else.
3959645	3963750	There's a lot of these for survivors like Alan Wake had quite a few of these.
3963790	3966353	You could play as like the waitress character or you could play as the
3966954	3968195	Other Detective, and Alan Wake 2.
3968536	3972059	I can't remember any of these names right now, but those are legendary skins.
3972860	3973981	Silent Hill has a ton of these.
3974322	3978466	Cheryl Mason is the main skin, but you can legendary transform into James.
3978807	3985353	You can transform into Alyssa, the cop from the first game.
3985373	3988136	There's all these characters you can transform into.
3989417	4016634	so the rumor is Lady Dimitrescu may actually be a legendary skin and I was thinking about it I could see that they could make a legendary skin for Nemesis and make it work so they could change the zombies into the vampire sisters instead and then instead of a tentacle like she would just have something else maybe her big hat I don't know but she'd have something else that she could attack you with so I could see that actually really working so I hope they do it I love Lady Dimitrescu as a character
4017194	4045033	so, also the new 2v8 mode map will of course be the Raccoon City Police Station which ironically used to be one big map and then they split it into two so it may just kind of be coming back as one giant map in the future so I guess we'll see what happens with that so, yeah, lots to come with the future of Dead by Daylight again, those are leaks right now but the DBD links tend to be correct so, yeah
4045733	4050319	Sjo and Hunter Matt in chat says, I'm kind of surprised Art the Clown isn't a killer at this point.
4050399	4052381	That, of course, being the character from Terrafire.
4053222	4054624	I'm also a little bit surprised.
4054684	4057387	There is already a clown character in the game.
4057748	4060291	There is a original killer simply called the Clown.
4061011	4086089	which is probably making it difficult for Pennywise or you know but again the hillbilly was always supposed was one of the original killers when the game first came out and that was always basically Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and they made they figured a way to make both characters work so there's no reason we can't have more clowns in the game you know for all of you that just love clowns but let's a lot of clowns are scary but
4086449	4110412	and so Art the Clown, pretty scary Pennywise, at least the Tim Curry version very fucking scary so I'm all for those killers coming to Dead by Daylight at some point but it sounds like you might have to settle for a Velociraptor nice or maybe you'll get to be that dinosaur that killed Nedry and you'll spit blinding stuff that could kind of work as a survivor mechanic
4111576	4113619	I can't pronounce that dinosaur's name.
4113820	4115262	Dilophosaurus or something like that?
4115583	4115983	Am I right?
4116103	4117566	It's something like that.
4117826	4118667	They're spitters!
4118988	4119970	Yeah, spitting dinosaurs.
4120050	4121171	Alright.
4121312	4122574	Let's move on, Loki.
4124216	4124537	Alright.
4126158	4130380	So the Xbox showcase, we're going to be getting that here very soon.
4130420	4133681	They're going to be showcasing a few different games that are coming out.
4134141	4137202	So this is going to take place on January 23rd at 1 p.m.
4137362	4137782	Eastern.
4138522	4146085	And the games that they're going to be covering, Doom the Dark Ages, South of Midnight, Clear Obscure Expedition 33.
4146525	4150347	They're going to be doing some deep dives in those.
4150707	4151147	That's cool.
4151287	4153568	I am very excited about Doom the Dark Ages.
4154890	4156411	I kind of want to check that out.
4156671	4160612	I keep forgetting that that's coming out, and every time that I remember again, I'm like, ooh, yes.
4161632	4165434	Well, it's nice to know some company for sure is doing some announcements this month.
4165674	4166674	We can bank on that.
4168955	4169815	Yeah.
4169895	4175477	And then there may be some other things they also show off as well, but at least those are the few that were highlighted.
4176380	4205574	so I'm looking forward to it I think I know it's early and a lot of you are going to go Rob you're silly but I think they should confirm a sequel to Indiana Jones I think they should just say hey we heard you love the game sequels and development because I hope it's true and we've heard all the talk about you know Disney wants one we know it did very well for Microsoft Bethesda that's been a really good success story for them so I really think they should just strike with the irons hot and confirm a sequels and development
4205974	4228406	although yes it would be a few years out um but like it would be the first xbox game xbox game to take years and years to develop where it wouldn't be starting from zero like you know yeah the system systems are already built uh assets are you know started or at least they have some assets for it so it's not i don't think the turnaround time would be that much
4228817	4229979	It wouldn't be, yeah.
4230119	4233623	If they were to make something that's very similar to the game they already did.
4233663	4236988	So hopefully they built that game with a trilogy in mind already.
4237208	4238350	That's how you really know.
4238390	4241894	If they built it on a backbone that's easily adaptable.
4241975	4242756	But we'll see.
4243136	4243336	Yeah.
4243917	4247599	Alright, that might be something they save for a summertime announcement, though, to be fair.
4247659	4248880	It makes sense.
4249400	4261006	Alright, let's talk about, this is a little bit of a follow-up, because last week we were talking about the company MyArcade, which does hardware, and we were talking about the Atari Game Station, which is something that they knew they were going to announce at CES.
4261506	4262847	And so they announced...
4262947	4269373	I like how that thing too, I just noticed on that, it has like the trackball and the knob and the numpad on it.
4269393	4269953	Yeah, yeah.
4269973	4270874	That's pretty cool looking.
4270894	4272215	Pretty cool.
4272235	4275838	But there's a few things that they've actually announced at the event.
4275878	4281964	So they also announced a Game Station Retro Go, which is combining Namco and Capcom games.
4282064	4286648	I would say the only downside to this thing is it's the same fucking games you've seen every time.
4287268	4287788	Every time.
4288188	4291850	It's Street Fighter, Mega Man, Strider, Final Fight.
4291950	4299593	It's literally every game on the machine behind me that Arcade 1UP put out, but Bionic Commando is there too, which would be, I'm pretty sure, the arcade version of that.
4299953	4301973	And then Namco is all the same games.
4301993	4302994	I don't think any of these are new.
4303314	4306795	Pole Position, Pac-Man, Mappy, Rally-X, Galaga, Dig Dug.
4307255	4308456	It's all the games you've seen before.
4308576	4313898	But not to minimize it, because it is a nice little combination of forces there, and that's pretty neat.
4314298	4316139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4342312	4347386	It plays Super Nintendo and Genesis games Yes, both You plug one on the bottom, one on the top
4348248	4353490	It honestly looks like something that somebody would make, you know, how they make the portable consoles or whatever.
4354830	4357071	It resembles something that someone would make like that.
4358011	4360172	Do you have any interest in any of these types of products?
4360272	4364313	I buy some of them, but... I don't.
4364473	4367454	I have so many consoles that I don't use.
4368634	4375196	Thankfully, we do still get use out of the Playdate and stuff.
4375356	4376877	I have looked at Evercade's
4377885	4383069	The handheld, you know, the one that takes all those cartridges and stuff.
4383189	4386371	I have looked at that I'd say once a week.
4387212	4388072	I've considered it.
4388532	4391394	But I don't know how much I would really play with that.
4391514	4392035	I would like...
4393261	4402306	Ironically, even though it's kind of like a legally gray area, I do see some of those ads on TikTok and stuff for these retro game consoles that have emulators and stuff.
4402326	4403947	And I obviously wouldn't buy something like that.
4404027	4415372	But I would like, if I was going to do something like that, I would want something that does have a large library of everything that can just dump on one console instead of having all these little consoles for everything.
4416313	4418434	Which is why Steam Decks and emulators are great.
4418454	4418534	Yeah.
4419811	4420312	It's true.
4420472	4422893	But it's nice to officially support what you can, too.
4423554	4429098	Right, yeah, and so, like, I'm not... I probably won't do that, but, you know, never say never.
4429118	4435863	There may be some stuff down the road that, like, there's something that has the right type of games with it or something, or maybe...
4437222	4445889	Maybe Evercade puts out a thing that plays the Evercade cartridges, but it also plays Super Nintendo cartridges and also plays this, you know, or, yeah, I don't know.
4446210	4446710	You never know.
4446890	4447050	Yeah.
4447631	4453236	Anyway, let's talk about the Atari Game Station Go, also from Retro, or excuse me, My Arcade, which we talked about last week.
4453516	4454517	We know the details now.
4454557	4456018	It's going to be out the third quarter of 2025 for $150.
4456058	4458120	It has 200 games pre-installed, including things like Pac-Man,
4462003	4482703	Missile Command, Centipede, Breakout, Star Raiders and it also has controllers for those games and so forth pretty neat and you know there's a paddle that's pretty neat and there's a small baby little trackball yeah this device looks pretty cool not since not every game uses every controller function there are LED lights that just illuminate what you need for a particular game
4483063	4484925	It's kind of a creative little thing as well.
4484945	4485505	That's kind of nice.
4507543	4508944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4535734	4539398	It looks like it's about the same size as one of the miniature arcade machines.
4539458	4545324	Not the baby ones, but the ones that are similar to the ones behind me when I broadcast live that are sitting on the tabletop.
4545645	4547467	It looks to be about that size.
4547687	4549589	So think about the size of like...
4550430	4551431	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4570273	4572054	Dark Tattoo in our chat says,
4590565	4598529	Case in point, I also have, it's harder to see because it's always, but I have a little Atari 2600, like a whole little console with preloaded games.
4598729	4602871	I bought, that's also a My Arcade, and I bought that at Costco.
4604677	4606278	DarkSakura is not here tonight.
4606298	4607679	We are still going to carry on with her segment.
4607699	4608939	So let's get to the classic game of the week.
4643553	4650819	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4651319	4654041	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4654321	4657784	All right, and with DarkSakura not here tonight, Loki, what did you pick?
4658324	4659465	No, I'm just messing with you.
4659505	4660086	I got you covered.
4660126	4660306	All right.
4661940	4662881	I picked nothing.
4663001	4664162	There are no classics.
4664182	4666463	What if I literally had put you on the spot, though, like that?
4666503	4667524	That would be really funny.
4667784	4669005	Oh, what would I have picked?
4669145	4669766	Oh, that's easy.
4669866	4671307	All right, well, save it for next time.
4671387	4671647	Next time.
4671687	4671927	All right.
4672508	4677552	For now, though, I went ahead and jumped in tonight, and the game we have picked for tonight is a really old game.
4677872	4680294	So DarkSakura has been doing these games that are like 10 years old.
4680454	4682916	I'm going to pick a game that's 45 years old this year, okay?
4684176	4686498	It's about as old as, you know, the host of this program.
4686778	4694182	This is a game called Wizard of War, but it's W-O-R because they're warriors.
4694662	4699965	This game had a speech chip in it, which again for 1980 was very, you know, revolutionary.
4700345	4703227	But the voice sounded like this.
4703647	4705128	Attention, warriors.
4705168	4706129	Like it's very, very...
4708610	4709871	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4726480	4727201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4742556	4768992	a red scorpion kind of creature and then once you clear everything out of a level you'll get the bonus the insect kind of fly looking warlock that flies around the screen really fast and if you shoot it you get a double score dungeon for your next round and then of course later into the game on later boards the wizard of war shows up a blue wizard that just basically ports around and does whatever the fuck he wants to try to eat your quarters he's very very difficult but yeah
4770513	4776575	This game eventually was ported, not just the, and I apologize, there are some serious flashes in this game.
4776635	4779516	I was made a note to give you the warning and then I forgot.
4779816	4782777	But when you do get double score dungeons, the game does flash in a way.
4782837	4786018	So sorry about that if that's throwing you as we broadcast live here.
4787018	4798782	This game was not just in the arcades, but it did get ported to Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, the Commodore Max, and of course, where I played this game the most,
4800003	4802744	that version.
4804165	4814732	Interesting enough, in the two-player game, not only, because of course we want to eat quarters as fast as we can, not only do you shoot the monsters in the level, you can shoot each other!
4815532	4816192	Be careful!
4816712	4820973	So this game did have friendly fire, which was kind of annoying to be honest, but it was there.
4821993	4831415	But if you have the strategy of standing back to back, like in a corner, you can pretty much just fire at anything that comes at you and you can get very far in the game.
4831835	4835296	So although it was kind of a mean mechanic, it was a really easy one to sort of cheese.
4835856	4842637	But I will say characters do kind of appear and disappear and they start to move very fast and they might appear on top of you and that's not very pleasant.
4842998	4844918	So it's not foolproof, but yeah.
4845538	4859310	Anyway, in each dungeon you have basically a big blue screen and the monsters, they will appear and disappear as they move, but there is a radar at the bottom that always shows you where those monsters are.
4859670	4865235	So if you kind of read the radar, you can kind of guess where to shoot and you'll be able to actually hit the monsters.
4865635	4868438	So that was actually kind of a neat mechanic, especially for its time.
4868598	4869058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4883843	4884503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4911738	4912500	and Dragonet.
4912540	4913683	I'm going to play a little audio.
4913723	4914725	See if you recognize this.
4920768	4925290	Yeah, and play that before every board that you would actually go through in that game.
4927592	4931534	And then that last note was if you had a double score dungeon.
4931574	4936096	So a lot of people recognize the theme because it sounds like they basically stole it from Dragnet.
4936176	4942900	I don't know if it was a classic piece that they were able to adapt easy or because it was only five notes or people weren't paying attention to video games as much in 1980.
4943540	4947262	I don't know, but it had that very familiar riff to a lot of people.
4948763	4949843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4968849	4969550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4989787	4991307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5015512	5040288	and the last time I remember playing this game was actually at Southern Fried Game Expo which was of course that arcade show that happens out in Atlanta that I went to a couple years ago and I actually still could do alright at this game I actually think I got on the high scoreboard for this game I did play enough of it on my Commodore 64 and plus when you're only playing one player you're not having to worry about shooting each other it's a little bit easier so there is that
5040928	5068007	so uh yeah quest buster in chat says old school pvp the sound effects were so good yeah um pretty pretty fun stuff i enjoyed this game i put a lot of hours in it and this is definitely definitely a classic at damn near 45 years old classic game of the week wizard of war w o r have you ever played that game loki very old i don't think so it's it's
5068547	5090258	Yeah, if you ever see an arcade machine at one of these classic arcade shows at like California Extreme or, you know, Southern Fried or wherever in your town, definitely worth a look just because, you know, it was like the, not the first game to have speech, but one of the earliest that had the very, but it's very hard to understand what the thing is saying.
5090698	5093379	It's a very robotic voice.
5093820	5096061	And this is really, yeah, very rudimentary, but it worked.
5096321	5096561	It worked.
5097742	5104727	All right, let's move on and talk about some rapid-fire news and cover some news going on really quickly here.
5104827	5105108	Loki.
5106108	5117617	I know it's going to disappoint a lot of you that have been holding out hope for a game that probably was never going to come out for that system that is not supported anymore whatsoever.
5117677	5120940	Actually, multiple systems aren't supported anymore, but the Mighty No.
5121440	5124302	9 for the 3DS and the Vita...
5126077	5128378	Your pre-orders have been cancelled by Amazon, unfortunately.
5130620	5138627	Considering the 3DS all-but-ended support a few years ago, I mean, I know if you still have one and can turn it on, you can still play it, but it's just funny.
5139567	5141469	The online store has been gone how long now?
5141609	5142109	It's just funny.
5143430	5150456	Yeah, so it's unfortunate that you will never be able to play that game, even though we
5151758	5152378	S, Actdeft, Drew,
5174575	5184628	and then of course we got some companies doing some good stuff at least so Final Fantasy 14 is giving folks a reprieve of
5185458	5185959	Thanks for watching!
5206028	5217296	and so they basically suspended that so folks that are not in their house or maybe without a house at this point aren't going to lose their other house in-game as well.
5217596	5219897	Yeah, it's nice when Final Fantasy does things like this.
5219937	5221158	I mean, it's a little silly.
5221699	5223800	That's the thing that made Alan Rage quit the game.
5223880	5228663	He lost his house because he didn't log in within 45 days and he was like, well, fuck it.
5228723	5229924	I worked all this for the house.
5229964	5230965	Fuck this game, basically.
5232126	5235748	So it's kind of a bummer they have timer on houses at all.
5235828	5236429	DarkSakura,
5255791	5256631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5272119	5278186	But on a different note, you know, since you did bring up the fires in Southern California, that's been tremendously difficult to hear about.
5278306	5280989	And I think people know, but that is nowhere near us.
5281069	5283451	We are on the complete other end of the state in Northern California.
5283511	5285474	So it's nothing to do with us here.
5285594	5288137	But certainly our hearts go out.
5288797	5292081	I know tons of people in Southern California and smoke in the air and
5292381	5293241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5315151	5343818	but there's also a lot of misinformation on the internet about the fires I would really encourage you if something is trying to tug at your heartstrings emotionally to get you to repost it or reclick it it's never a bad question to ask yourself is this actually true because there's unfortunately a lot of BS out there right now but the truth is those people out there need help and if you can donate to a reputable charity I'm going to be honest I would discourage
5345191	5350633	Unless you know the people directly, the individual GoFundMes and stuff like that, because unfortunately there are a lot of bad actors out there.
5351113	5359656	And I would look at charities that are actively, you know, whether that be the Red Cross or another charity that really speaks to you, working with those types of relief efforts.
5360197	5362618	So, yeah, it's just horrible.
5362718	5363438	Horrible, horrible, horrible.
5363658	5365819	Yeah, and I see a lot of love and chat going on out there.
5366479	5368520	SJ100Matt says, those fires have been awful.
5368880	5370100	Hoping for the best for everyone.
5370180	5372161	PodCulture says those fires are fucking massive.
5372221	5372761	Yes, they are.
5372821	5373562	It's really scary.
5374062	5374182	So...
5375387	5375848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5383567	5384828	Really hard to hear about.
5385048	5385328	All right.
5386469	5387209	Moving on, though.
5387329	5390091	Focusing on gamers doing good and raising money for charity.
5390571	5393732	One of the biggest names in the business wrapped up their big marathon this week.
5393933	5399395	Awesome Games Done Quick totaled a donation amount above $2.5 million.
5399416	5403318	If you want to be exact, $2,556,500 raised for the Prevent Cancer Foundation from running games very quickly.
5403338	5403618	Which, yes...
5409861	5412324	Included Crazy Taxi with a live backing band.
5412664	5418210	And as I think I mentioned earlier in the show, I saw the 1 million being broken with Chunathan and that being played and all that.
5418830	5421453	So there's lots of stuff all over that.
5421473	5422494	There was also some donate.
5422514	5424856	That was not just things that were raised by gamers.
5425197	5427519	There were donations through partners, Fangamer.
5428080	5431163	The ET has donated many times before, Humble Bundle.
5431403	5442352	a lot of the same names you usually see with these types of charity drives but still really really cool to see the entire community get involved did you know someone beat Elden Ring on a saxophone, Loki?
5442652	5449318	I saw that I don't know how that's possible but I saw that well it's like playing Dreamcast games with a fishing controller why would you do it?
5449658	5451059	because you can
5451920	5452601	Alright, anyway.
5453081	5458366	One more quick note for you, and that is that The Last of Us Season 2, we know when it's coming.
5458426	5459827	It's coming in April.
5461008	5462690	HBO and Max announced this.
5463290	5465712	This was also a PlayStation Productions announcement.
5465792	5467354	I believe this was a part of...
5467814	5470276	Sony doing some various announcements at CES.
5470296	5471736	We're going to have a few more in just a moment.
5472057	5476399	But yeah, The Last of Us Season 2 will be out April of 2025.
5476439	5480522	So you actually don't have to wait a terribly long time for this.
5480642	5486045	And the first season, obviously, critical success, not just consumer success.
5486445	5493490	So I think there's a lot of expectations around the second series, especially when the second game, a little controversial for some people.
5493930	5495051	But I think some of those...
5496849	5500551	are going to play out better in a TV thing.
5500891	5509595	Because people aren't going to be pissed about who they might have to take control of in the game and who might the game kind of push as a hero or whatever.
5509675	5511716	That whole weird controversy going with that.
5512096	5515958	But in a movie, it's all kind of out there, which will be very interesting.
5516318	5521200	So I'm very curious to see if it does as well as critically as the first series did.
5521660	5523681	And plus, how much they mirror the game.
5523721	5525042	Because again, if you know the game...
5525902	5552957	some major happens kind of early on and I wouldn't be surprised if they try to get through all of season two before that happens because that would make for a better finale for season two to be honest but we'll see we'll see anyway I'm being vague on purpose because even though the game is old I realize now people are experiencing the story through the show so if you want to seek out spoilers go for it but at the same time there's nothing that says the show has to follow the book
5554346	5556747	Game of Thrones didn't at some point.
5557288	5557848	They couldn't.
5557888	5558669	There was no book.
5560189	5565192	There was only they had to do an entire season based on concepts of a plan and it showed.
5565753	5566033	All right.
5567174	5568254	Anyway, let's move on.
5568294	5571656	Let's travel the world and check out some release dates and check out some games coming out near you.
5571676	5572797	We'll start in the US, Loki.
5573976	5578200	Alright, well in the US, we don't have a ton, but we've got a few things coming out this week.
5578220	5582544	So starting off with Turnip Boy robs a bank.
5583464	5586888	And he's going from insurance fraud to robbing a bank now.
5587688	5589190	Yeah, it's on iOS and Android.
5589710	5593371	By the way, Loki, since we brought up Awesome Games Done Quick, sorry.
5593792	5601735	Did you see that for like a lot of the incentives that were named the character, Luigi was being named as the character for like a lot of those incentives.
5602035	5603935	A lot of Mario Party fans out there.
5604196	5605636	A lot of Mario Party fans.
5605656	5606817	A lot of Mario Party fans.
5606897	5608217	It's the year Luigi again.
5609458	5610258	It really is.
5610818	5611258	Oh boy.
5611798	5618341	Anyway, wouldn't that be a gag if Nintendo came out and said it's the year of Luigi again?
5619824	5621405	The internet would literally shit.
5621785	5622466	It's not going to happen.
5624747	5630531	Nintendo does have people, even in Japan, that sit in the corner and say, that might not be a good idea.
5630551	5631352	No, don't do that.
5631572	5632232	Don't do that.
5632673	5634714	You can see the Pokemon leaks did that.
5634854	5648803	There were certain Pokemon they strayed away from because they said there's actually a fan Pokemon that's really close to this that we need to actually... So you saw things where it was like fan speculation, so it was actively creatively hurting Pokemon, which was interesting.
5650304	5665678	SSJ100Matt has the trick Year of Waluigi It's his time It's his time Sorry Loki We have Blade Chimera on PC, Nintendo Switch
5666604	5677127	Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Nintendo Switch, Dreadout Remastered Collection on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5.
5678608	5685710	We've got Markle Ragas Rage on PC and Xbox Series.
5687279	5708722	and let's see Dynasty Warriors Origins on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Tales of Graces F Remastered on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series I would like to point out one thing though I noticed it's kind of strange to me
5709915	5715357	and just follow me and this might leak more credence into the whole November 17th announcement.
5715998	5717338	You mean January 17th?
5718419	5719419	Yeah, January 17th.
5720500	5722341	Nintendo games typically come out on Fridays.
5723221	5724742	This is coming out on a Thursday.
5725666	5726406	That's strange.
5728827	5729867	That seems strange.
5729987	5734289	I know it doesn't really matter, but that seems strange to me.
5734889	5737429	That it's coming out on a Thursday and not a Friday.
5738110	5749453	Because for the last several months, and way back to when I was working at a video game distributor, Nintendo typically releases their games on Fridays.
5750765	5776444	they're annoying in the sense that they're one of the only companies that was doing it at the time and then everybody started following suit whereas we prefer that it was on Tuesdays where that's when major movie releases on video come out but it is strange that this is on a Thursday instead of a Friday not that they couldn't release a game and make an announcement the same day but it does seem strange to me alright
5777935	5778375	DarkSakura
5800753	5805097	Tales of Grace's F Remastered, also out in Japan on that same day, January 16th.
5805477	5809440	A game called Kenka Banshu Otome Double Pack is also out in Japan.
5809760	5812362	So if it's a double pack, I'm trying to see which two games is it.
5815100	5815540	I'm not sure.
5815560	5822224	There's no description for this, but it looks like it's one of those like bros in high school simulation type of games and that whole thing.
5822944	5828007	A game called Even If Tempest, Dawning Connections, also out on the 16th.
5828427	5830529	Those are all releases on the Nintendo Switch.
5830949	5836412	If I look at the PlayStation 5, we have Sin Duality, Echo of Ada.
5836832	5838553	Tales of Graces F Remastered
5854681	5881356	we also have on the 17th Dynasty Warriors Origins also gets a limited edition release in Japan I don't know if there's a regular release for that I'm just seeing a limited edition for whatever reason so oh no there it is up there so we also have yeah Dynasty Warriors Origins is also getting a regular edition sorry this release list I'm looking at is kind of messy all over the place but I guess they're just getting the calendar arranged all right let's look at the UK Loki
5882639	5892125	Alright, so in the UK we've got looks like also Donkey Kong Country Returns HD also on the 16th.
5892965	5893986	It's around the country.
5894126	5895267	Don't know what to say about that.
5896007	5910516	Tales of Graces F Remastered on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, PC and Switch and Dynasty Warriors Origins on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and that's it.
5912123	5912703	All right.
5913244	5916505	Well, we got a couple more news stories for you, and then we'll get to the listener roundtable.
5916545	5922907	If any of you want to call in tonight over at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord, although I would encourage you to join the Discord chat with us throughout the week.
5923828	5925609	We'll be talking about, you know, whatever.
5925849	5927469	You guys put a lot of good suggestions in chat.
5927509	5931771	We pull some of those stories for what we talk about, and sometimes we just get to chatting.
5932411	5933492	There was the other night, it was actually...
5934272	5935913	Funny enough, I don't know if y'all know this.
5936133	5942957	It was Tuesday night when I was kind of sitting on the information about Mr. Smush and kind of needed something to take my mind off it for a little bit.
5943297	5947860	I actually got into the VOG Discord and we were chatting about something completely unrelated and I was actually in there chatting.
5947880	5948680	We had a good little chat.
5949101	5953884	So I don't know if y'all know, but that was actually helping me keep my mind off of other stuff.
5953944	5954504	So thanks.
5955284	5955565	All right.
5956565	5959327	Anyway, let's get to the rest of the news.
5959367	5959587	Loki.
5960717	5962098	Well, this is interesting.
5962258	5969743	So, apparently, Sony Movie Studios are going to be making some more Sony property movies.
5970424	5977088	And, of course, some of these aren't... I mean, none of them are very surprising, the two successful franchises.
5977128	5979330	So, Horizon Zero Dawn...
5982008	5987150	Helldivers 2 and an anime spinoff of Ghost of Tsushima.
5987750	5989770	So I'm on board with Horizon.
5990390	5991931	I'm on board with Ghost of Tsushima.
5992671	5997753	Helldivers, that's just Starship Troopers.
5999073	6001234	We all know that this is just Starship Troopers, right?
6001814	6008796	You're taking a game that's based off of Starship Troopers and Terminator and then you're
6009673	6010054	StarShipTroopers
6025751	6026692	I guess we'll have to see.
6026792	6030214	I don't know, but then again, if you think about it, it's a whole other generation now, right?
6030874	6031535	That's true.
6032075	6035377	There's a lot of people that won't even remember the original, which is a damn shame.
6035898	6038179	But, you know, it is what it is.
6038199	6040340	I don't know, is Paul Verhoeven still alive?
6040440	6042342	Can he just direct this movie instead?
6043783	6045224	I don't think he's still making movies if he is.
6046584	6048886	Oh, well, that's too bad.
6049026	6049326	All right.
6050527	6051808	Last but not least, hey,
6053203	6054084	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6072216	6087415	I'm here for it and so I want to end our official news roll on this note tonight which is Shift Up which is a South Korean company and they made the PlayStation 5 exclusive action game Stellar Blade they have gifted all of their staff a PlayStation 5 Pro
6089077	6093680	and given a cash bonus of 5 million won, which is around $3,400.
6093740	6096802	So to kind of put that in perspective.
6097462	6100804	This was published in a publication in South Korea called Naver.
6101685	6108089	And this was a bonus that was put out there to encourage the company's staff, as bonuses tend to do.
6108929	6111752	Shift Up has about 311 employees.
6112312	6113874	Shift Up, of course, had a pretty good 2024.
6115095	6117117	Stellar Blade did pretty well.
6118017	6122001	Shift Up has also done crossover DLC with Nier Automata for this game.
6123002	6126905	In July, the company raised around $320 million or $435 billion won after an initial public offering.
6131989	6142355	In a comment, ShiftUp is saying that Stellar Blade's launch sales, quote, continued at a stabilized level, although we don't know exactly what that level looks like, but if we're seeing this, pretty good.
6142635	6150479	We also know Stellar Blade is coming to PC in 2025, as a lot of the Sony titles are doing, and it expects to do pretty well there.
6152136	6159198	More bonuses, more incentives, more credit to the hardworking people making these games, for sure.
6159879	6163320	DarkTC in chat says, I know Rob's been sour on the game industry last week.
6163700	6167161	I don't disagree, but it's always nice to hear stuff like this with some good news.
6167261	6167941	Oh, absolutely.
6168021	6169942	I don't want to be sour on the game industry.
6170402	6193643	I don't want to be that guy that's sitting here just complaining about video games like why fucking podcast about video games if you just hate everything about it but like this last year it's been rough y'all so I'm liking this energy about some bonuses and it's a granted it's not in America but it's a start let's take that energy and manifest that for some of the developers in other countries as well all right with that
6194616	6195777	We're going to go to the Listener Roundtable.
6196157	6202841	We encourage you all to email us or you can also call in over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6203361	6206063	I don't believe we had any emails tonight.
6206123	6207944	I'm going to log in and just double check.
6208225	6209705	But again, if you want to participate...
6210746	6239731	you always can do that by sending us an email participate at orangeloungeradio.com although I know many of you just prefer to chat or use discord and that's fine too very few people seem to use emails anymore such as seems to be the case so alright we just have one spam email and I even put it in the trash so Jamie won't complain about it next week mark the word I finally moved an email to the trash alright
6241816	6244077	Loki, on that note, do you have any last minute stories for us?
6244577	6247157	I did have one last thing I was going to mention.
6247277	6258820	So this came out via the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit, but more details regarding the whole Genki and CES booth.
6259060	6263721	Apparently Nintendo was not happy with them being there and they actually sent lawyers to
6264381	6267883	I will say this I will say this
6293488	6294988	Kudos to them holding their ground.
6295288	6298450	You know, if they're going to be wrong, they're going to be big wrong.
6298610	6308913	Like, you know, I don't think I love what Genki's doing in this case, but I, like everybody else, also feel like this is literally the worst kept secret in gaming.
6309474	6309934	And like...
6310994	6340209	it's just getting annoying like we're just all rolling our eyes like come on Nintendo like just like I get it they couldn't say anything because the holiday they don't want to cannibalize sales not everybody follows the industry as close as the rest of us do but like it's and again this is why I'm sitting here going it really ought to be next week if it's not and we're looking at something closer to the end of March in their original commitment that's going to put this whole thing it's just it's just getting annoying but is that going to make me not buy one
6340629	6340849	No.
6342810	6344611	Especially if it plays the old games better.
6344951	6346272	That's all I need, honestly.
6346532	6356456	If I could replay Pokemon Legends better on a newer console, or not just that, Violet
6357947	6359569	Why can't I remember the names of those games?
6359629	6360150	Oh my god.
6360450	6361171	Scarlet Violet.
6361671	6362993	If I can play that, Gen 10, 9.
6364014	6368940	If I can play Gen 9 better on a new Switch console, sign me the fuck up.
6368980	6370802	That's all I need, to be honest.
6371322	6371503	So...
6372932	6375473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6391519	6396525	But Genki is profiting off of an unannounced Nintendo product, no matter which way you slice it.
6396646	6401532	That could be the problem, which isn't quite the same thing as the Streisand effect, though I get what you're saying, of course.
6402333	6407780	And SGO100 Matt, with the classic Schoolyard comeback of Dbrand started it, honestly.
6410765	6427476	Well, there's also another... I mean, there's a lot of rumor and speculation when it comes to the Switch 2 right now, but apparently another leaker has... or an Apple leaker normally says that they've confirmed that the Switch 2 is on the black market in China right now.
6428897	6431058	Like some development samples have gotten leaked out there.
6431999	6434060	So maybe they picked it up that way?
6434160	6434500	I don't know.
6434721	6435741	It's all a big mess.
6435841	6436522	Let's just wait and...
6437625	6438606	Wait for them to announce it.
6438686	6439987	Like, I just don't care at this point.
6440027	6441348	Just announce it.
6441368	6442229	We already kind of know what it is.
6442269	6442990	What do you think?
6443870	6445192	On the plausibility meter.
6445332	6447354	Let's get out the plausometer.
6447454	6449515	It's like an applause meter, but it's plausibility.
6450136	6453239	Zero meaning not fucking happening.
6453339	6455521	There is no fucking way.
6455641	6457883	That would be like, zero would be like
6459795	6461176	I don't know, but not happening, okay?
6461716	6463957	10 is absolutely happening.
6464497	6468579	I would bet money is absolutely, okay, on the plausibility scale.
6468959	6470000	Chad, I want to hear from you too.
6470900	6472481	Switch to revealed this week.
6472901	6473722	Plausibility scale.
6475803	6476123	Four.
6476943	6477163	Four.
6477183	6479304	I think that's a good guess.
6481485	6482426	I'm actually going to agree with that.
6482586	6483506	I'm going to copy your homework.
6483546	6484147	I'm going to say four.
6484167	6484247	Four.
6485051	6489657	I don't think it's quite right in the middle, but I think it's... Maybe I would go a little higher.
6489737	6490198	Alright, fine.
6490338	6490819	I'll go five.
6491319	6491760	I'll go five.
6492521	6493643	It could be like a couple weeks.
6494183	6502414	I think it's gonna be this month because you have to... Let's assume that they are putting out this financial quarter.
6504124	6519862	you have to give some sort of lead time to for advertising and all that stuff like I get it that they want to play on their own timetable unless it is delayed to fall but either way like I feel that they need to announce something at this point
6521495	6527678	Let's see, DarkTituya says 7 or 8, MikeDev says 7, OrangeRite says 6, SJ100Matt says 6.
6527778	6529899	Interesting, everybody in chat guessing higher than we did.
6530219	6530599	Interesting.
6530619	6531959	Maybe we're just negative.
6532900	6535141	These years and years have made us negative, Loki.
6535681	6537882	QuestBuster says, I'm going to say Cheesecake.
6538662	6540323	Honestly, valid.
6542423	6563415	on a scale of 1 to 10, Cheesecake is always the right answer, absolutely Orange Rite says, this month 8 and kind of along the same lines as what we've been saying, with all the leaks it's gotta be imminent Bobby Blackwolf says, I was Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I was gonna say Taco well if you say Taco, then you're saying it's getting announced Tuesday because it's Taco Tuesday
6564315	6590588	so but then I well Tuesday would be kind of funny because you know two Nintendo Switch 2 it's Switch Tuesday I you know if it was Tuesday I feel like Nintendo makes that announcement today yesterday Friday I there is again a non-zero chance I would give this maybe a a one or a two on the plausibility meter that tomorrow morning we wake up to the announcement of the Direct
6592785	6594447	I think that's... But I don't think it'll be Tuesday.
6594727	6599753	It'll be... I think Thursday... Honestly, Thursday does seem like the most logical day for them to do it.
6599833	6605439	But there is a non-zero chance we wake up tomorrow and it's a Thursday reveal.
6605539	6608383	And of course, we could all be sitting here in seven days' time going...
6610258	6619168	Put my clown dress on because honk honk, here I am, Boo Boo the Fool once again, getting fooled by Nintendo and not a goddamn thing happened this week again.
6619929	6621972	Wow, it's everything that we thought it was going to be.
6622632	6624114	Surprise, it's fucking nothing.
6624134	6626156	That Mario Kart 9, woo.
6626577	6627999	That was so unexpected.
6628854	6634156	Well, wouldn't it actually be, I know everybody's saying Mario Kart 9, but I actually thought it's supposed to be Mario Kart 10.
6635157	6637358	Don't you consider the mobile game Mario Kart 9?
6637398	6639419	The leakers have already said 9, so we'll see.
6639599	6640119	I think it's going to be 9.
6640159	6640919	Fuck the leakers.
6641860	6643580	I'm talking about logic, reason, sense.
6644000	6653505	Yeah, but they're not going to give actual credence to Mario Kart World Circuit or whatever it is, but that's not a real game.
6653825	6654385	It's a mobile game.
6655540	6657261	Death says Mario Kart 8.2.
6658101	6660082	That's my favorite name, Mario Kart 8.2.
6661523	6662423	8.2 is the Switch version.
6662943	6663784	8.2, Infinity Lab.
6665284	6666225	Okay, then Mario Kart 8.3.
6667906	6673388	Ooh, Bobby Blackwolf with the really cool reboot suggestion going, it's just going to be simply Mario Kart.
6673928	6676910	Not even Super Mario Kart on your Super Switch?
6680091	6681592	Do you think Super Switch is the name, Loki?
6681612	6681712	Okay.
6682628	6683109	Mario Kart 2.
6683149	6685611	No, the name of the system.
6685671	6686552	Do you think it's Super Switch?
6687553	6687714	No.
6688074	6688695	No, I don't either.
6689275	6690317	I think it's a cute title.
6690597	6692579	Super was the age of the 90s.
6693840	6694982	Nothing is super anymore.
6695475	6696035	Switch 2 is good enough.
6728032	6730814	Alright, well with that, we're going to wrap up for tonight.
6730854	6734057	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with our show.

6752572	6753833	We'll be back in seven days.
6754614	6771569	switch announcement or not to do this all over again either we're going to come in with our clown nose I think I have a clown nose somewhere and maybe if they don't announcement I don't want to commit to it because I might not be able to find my clown nose but if I can and they don't announcement I'll come in with my clown nose on and go honk honk I got played the fool again we'll see all right um
6772873	6774133	So stay tuned.
6774173	6776654	Seven days we'll be doing that and back again.
6776714	6778135	Hopefully DarkSakura is back with us this week.
6778175	6779035	I don't see why she won't be.
6779435	6780176	So we'll have that.
6781096	6782556	Yeah, very, very excited.
6782656	6786458	So Bobby Blackwell says, just pick up a clown nose at Party City.
6786598	6786978	Oh, wait.
6787558	6789659	Hey, guess which store I went by today.
6789699	6792760	So I actually went out on Ingress today because it's called Second Sunday in Ingress.
6793080	6798542	And I did a mission banner downtown and I got to walk right by the downtown Macy's, which guess what?
6799465	6799965	Closing.
6800285	6801126	Everything must go.
6801146	6801286	Yep.
6801526	6802387	All the signs are up.
6802507	6804508	Same with the one local here.
6804748	6805088	Yeah.
6805168	6805748	Both of them.
6805908	6806509	Yeah.
6807009	6811191	It's like... Well, I think... That mall has almost no anchors left.
6811531	6818615	Well, Macy's in general, because they're opening a new one in Elk Grove, but it's going to look like a Marshall's or a TJ Maxx.
6818855	6820316	That's where Macy's is headed now.
6820376	6823237	It's going to be that size and not like a giant mall tenant.
6823297	6826139	It's going to look more like a home goods, that type of store.
6826659	6827259	Oh, interesting.
6827279	6827439	Was...
6828720	6831481	Penny's the one that had Toys R Us or is that Macy's?
6831501	6832041	That's Macy's.
6833782	6835903	Penny's has Sephora and some other stuff.
6836603	6836823	Meh.
6838764	6840305	Alright, final thoughts.
6840385	6840825	Let's do them.
6840865	6841845	Loki, your final thought tonight.
6844286	6845287	We'll be busy this week.

6870443	6872403	Really appreciate that and I'll send that along to Alan.
