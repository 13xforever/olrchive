11257	12738	isn't the obvious headline tonight.
20223	21544	I didn't do this because I'm sick.
21584	28428	What gave you that idea?
28568	29669	This is me burying the lead.
29869	34692	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to talk about the big stories and other pinches of gaming news.
34912	37094	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
39760	40880	Feel better, Jason.
40960	42881	Hi, everybody out there on the internet.
42921	47282	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47382	56963	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again, episode number 1032 of our program tonight, January the 19th of 2025.
57343	64825	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64925	65305	Welcome back.
65805	66185	Hi!
66406	66726	Hi!
67266	70849	I know Jason's under the weather this week from the intro, but hopefully you're doing a lot better.
71930	80917	Oh, it's my usual vocal issues have been going on, but my migraine has abated for today, so that's good.
80977	83359	That's good, because migraines are literally the worst thing ever.
84480	89784	Yeah, I'm actually going through new treatment for my migraines, although I really wish they would approve the Botox.
89984	90725	That would have been a great...
91985	97727	And people sometimes don't realize that Botox is for more than just, you know, real housewife usage.
98047	99968	It has medical merits as well.
100208	102308	The appearance of a brow lift would have been nice.
102328	104569	You know, I'm just saying.
104609	107150	Yeah, sometimes the side effects aren't so bad.
108170	108930	Yeah, not so bad.
109110	110351	Fair enough.
110451	112551	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
113551	113832	Hello.
114092	114472	Hi, Loki.
114492	115032	How are you doing?
116141	116822	I'm doing alright.
116982	118985	Busy.
119306	120167	What a week, huh?
122491	124374	Yeah, it's been a week.
124574	128059	Yeah, I notice behind you tonight you got Minecraft going on tonight.
128099	128900	Is this one of your videos?
129781	130842	No, it's not one of my videos.
130902	134223	It's one of my fellow cast members' videos.
134503	134763	Oh, cool.
134784	139046	So that's Jessix, his season finale for season three.
139126	142287	So he did this whole kind of... I've seen them in chat before.
142968	144848	Yeah, Star Wars, but not Star Wars.
145169	148350	So, you know, he had the Mighty Imperium and stuff like that.
148370	149611	Legally distinct Star Wars.
150171	151473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
165182	165462	All right.
165842	179592	Well, and we hope you all will check us out live sometimes because we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, VOG Network.
179932	182574	You know, we've been doing this show a long time.
182914	190539	And over these years, it's sometimes interesting to look back on things and go, boy, we sure got that right or we sure got that wrong.
190779	191939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
206064	207384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
235131	243017	So, yeah, and I think we kind of landed on, yeah, it's non-zero that it'll happen this week.
243037	244318	We felt pretty good it would happen that week.
244598	248100	And I think where I used non-zero was, and it will be announced Monday.
248641	252103	Well, they didn't really announce anything, right?
252243	254825	And I know you're going to get into this, Loki, with the kickoff topic.
254885	259889	But in looking back, obviously, they kind of dropped that trailer on us Thursday with no announcement.
259909	260910	And it was interesting because...
261750	262490	and DarkSakura.com.
281400	284861	So I replied and I said, well, you know what they might do?
285081	288642	They might just drop a two minute trailer that that's it.
288722	299326	Like it's not like people are kind of saying are expecting like a press event, but they'll probably just drop like a two minute trailer, kind of similar to how would the original Nintendo Switch be.
299386	302148	They dropped in October, and I'm going to come back to this later.
302568	309213	In October, they dropped an original kind of like two-minute trailer to show what made the switch the switch, right?
309913	312435	And I go to bed and I wake up the next morning.
312455	315417	Now, keep in mind, they dropped that video at what, like 10 Eastern?
315918	317178	So it's 7 here.
317739	319020	And I think I get up at like 7.15.
319120	320841	So the first thing I woke up to...
324364	331470	I had a notification from Blue Sky on my phone where somebody replied to that and said, Soothsayer.
332771	336515	And I was like, uh-oh.
336595	337055	What happened?
337095	337656	Did they do it?
338236	341159	And sure enough, I go online and it dropped a two-minute train.
341399	344883	So yes, the way that was confirmed for me was somebody calling me a soothsayer.
344943	346985	And I was like, you know, so I just laughed.
347045	348986	And, you know, I don't...
349847	357010	I actually don't take credit for forecasting this one because this was really a process of elimination type of scenario, right?
360612	366314	All that's left at this point is for them to do a two-minute little teaser announce, and that's going to be that.
366694	368115	But I will turn it over to Loki.
368735	371497	Loki, Nintendo Switch 2, it happened.
371857	372857	We got a two-minute look.
372957	378960	Let's do our seven-hour YouTube on everything that is absolutely undeniably true about the Nintendo Switch 2.
379480	383221	Everything that you saw is basically what you saw.
383322	383522	Yes.
383662	385963	So it's all of the leaks.
386003	393165	The two minute teaser was actually, it was just that clip from Star Wars Episode 7 where Harrison Ford goes, it's true.
393765	394146	All of it.
394226	394586	All of it.
394686	396006	And then it was the Switch 2 logo.
396026	396507	And that was it.
396607	397487	That was the announced trailer.
398530	407397	Yeah, so basically confirming everything that has been rumored and all the peripherals that are not final, you know, all that stuff, essentially.
408778	413121	They didn't go into any details on anything other than what stuff looks like.
414162	418045	And there's people are reading between the lines somewhat on that.
418165	418866	Like, I know...
419466	423767	talking about, oh, the Joy-Cons can be used as mice or something like that.
424767	426688	Essentially, though, that everything is bigger.
426808	427908	The system is bigger.
428148	429609	The Joy-Cons are bigger.
430529	432129	They are magnetically connected.
432149	433930	There's no more rail system anymore.
435110	439171	And, yeah, I mean, the dock looks new as well.
439271	442432	It doesn't cover the whole screen, which is kind of interesting, I guess.
443612	446933	And we know that, you know,
447423	450867	Mario Kart 9 is coming because that's what they showed off.
452009	454432	Also, they are going to be going into more details.
455032	456434	Is it Mario Kart 9?
457736	458256	I think it is.
458316	459438	It's already been leaked that it was 9.
459738	463122	To be fair, and Bobby brought up a good point on his show.
463763	466384	I think there's a little wiggle room there for a different name that we might find out in April.
493220	494301	Alright, we'll see.
495522	495942	Alright.
498304	502748	Anyways, because we want to be very particular about it.
502788	507972	Technically, there already is a Mario Kart 9 with Mario Kart Tour, but that's a whole game.
507992	509594	That's what I was trying to tell you last week.
510560	512522	Yeah, but I still think it's going to be Mario Kart 9.
513222	520448	Even still, because I don't think they're going to acknowledge the, you know, aside from bringing the tracks over, I don't think they're really going to acknowledge the mobile game at all.
521729	534439	Anyways, yeah, so Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 on April 2nd, which I guess that blows out the whole quarter one launch out of the water, so that's
535445	544949	Yeah, to be fair with all my, you know, soothsayer jokes and everything, I really was convinced it was going to be before the financial year was over, they would release this.
544989	547170	So I'm willing to admit I got that one wrong, which is a bummer.
548270	551712	But, you know, take the time to get it right.
551732	554393	A good game is a good game, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, all that stuff.
554873	559335	But, you know, speaking of that timetable, though, just real quick, I will mention, you
563936	565877	Look at the original Switch, right?
565957	571939	We had the teaser trailer in October, and then the full reveal came three months later in January, right?
572499	578501	And what we know, we had the teaser trailer here in June, and then we have the full announcements three months later in April.
578541	580422	We know that now because they gave us the date, right?
581863	591186	And you could, from there, assume maybe that if it went by a similar pattern, it would be two to three months after, and we could be looking at a...
592370	596854	Late June, Early July type of release for this.
596954	601739	I'm not sure why that time frame would be desired.
601799	606062	But again, just saying, it's interesting.
607224	608325	Well, here's a couple...
609073	610635	Propositions for that.
612076	616561	For us in the United States, it's after tax time.
618664	622067	It is when school is getting out.
622488	630317	And it's also technically a dead period in the video game release cycle most of the summer from like about...
631937	636600	May through July, the end of July is essentially a dead period.
636880	639742	So they could have the attention all to themselves essentially.
640322	645326	And also the hype around Summer Games Fest type of stuff.
645806	648988	So maybe that might be a reason.
649448	651990	Or I think it may just still come out fourth quarter.
652790	657013	And they just may take some extra time to get those pre-orders in.
657642	664005	But along with the direct, they're going to be doing live kind of early access to it.
664325	681333	So actually coinciding with the same time period, you're going to be able to experience the Nintendo Switch starting in New York from April 4th through the 6th at Center 415 in Los Angeles in Television City.
682453	703027	from April 11th through the 13th and then finally Dallas at the Embarcadero building at Fair Park from April 25th through the 27th and registration is open as of a couple days ago so you'll need to go register on Nintendo's website nintendo.com slash us nintendo-switch-2-experience
705589	707010	If you're interested.
729338	745529	and judging on the places that they are setting all these things up it seems to be they're all indoors and I would assume these are more like traveling E3 type of booths but maybe it's something where you move room to room I find the location of Television City in LA that's where they used to do the Price is Right
746449	766483	so it's that kind of building uh but you know well empty studios are giant rooms that are meant to be reconfigured over and over so like on that you know front I'm like okay yeah that makes sense it's just it's just it's more of a fun fact that oh this is where they used to do the prices right but I think they moved it uh only like a couple years ago but anyway
767844	771647	The New York location, the Dallas... It was Dallas, not Houston, right?
771887	775570	Those locations are also big indoor spaces, it seems like.
775670	785998	So I wonder if they are setting it up as some sort of... Maybe you go from room to room and you'll see the various launch games and you'll get a chance to do hands-on with each launch game.
786118	786478	I don't know.
787019	788180	Because originally when...
788720	789581	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
809514	813757	They seem to know about how long the experience is going to take and that they have everything on tight windows.
814117	828006	I kind of go, maybe they are doing something a little more structured that's intended to move people through in a reasonable amount of time and that they know what that capacity is so that they don't have giant lines on lines and crowd control situations.
828346	831008	So it sounds like it might be an interesting event.
831068	833230	I don't know if I'm willing to go to LA.
834571	834851	Nah.
835591	836092	That's a lot.
837439	839360	I was going to mention a few things that were confirmed.
839560	842701	So first off, backwards compatibility is confirmed.
842981	848644	However, they do have the caveat of some titles may not be compatible.
849144	850205	That's a little weird.
851005	855507	Well, that's not necessarily... Well, they announced the backwards compatibility thing a few months ago.
855747	857908	The problem was they didn't announce the Kavat until now.
858717	872545	Well, I think the caveat there is essentially that it's probably more along the lines of stuff that requires the Nintendo Switch controller to be used in certain ways, like Labo, for example.
872885	875226	The new Joy-Cons are not going to fit Labo.
876487	877607	Oh, okay, I gotcha.
877828	880829	So, like, that, I think that's what that's about.
880849	882030	Didn't they go image abandon Labo?
883257	888778	Yeah, but there's like other things that may have that kind of things and they kind of have to point that stuff out just in case.
888838	894139	Yeah, legally when they make a claim like that, they want to avoid anything, you know, even if, yeah, you're right for the most part.
894459	899460	But you never know, somebody might have built the 3D, the 3D glasses thing in Labo is kind of cute.
899600	910462	So somebody might want to try that on their Switch 2 and then they'll realize, oh, not only is the Switch 2 system too big to actually fit the specs, the old one, but then the controllers and da-da-da-da-da.
911162	913524	I'm also surprised how black the controllers are.
913905	918369	Whereas they are kind of the red and blue, it's mostly black.
918389	922813	So I'm wondering if we'll see more variations on that probably later on down the road.
923354	923974	I'm sure we will.
924929	925589	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
945270	971264	that's the way my Switch is but yeah I mean they could release controllers and I'm sure they will that are Zelda themed Pokemon themed is like a guarantee that'll have you know different things for whenever Gen 10 or maybe Legends Z to A is announced but I'm very curious to see how some of these games now I'm thinking maybe at that LA event they'll have Pokemon Legends Z to A dang maybe I should register just see if I get it or not
972396	974897	I mean, you know, essentially it could be coming out in a few months.
975057	976417	Like, I don't know.
977557	977938	It's true.
979298	980058	It's a long drive.
980078	984819	Yeah, it is a long drive, but I could, you know, I can make a weekend of it and be like, oh, I'll go see Victoria.
984859	987460	I still have not been to Mario Land, which is not that far.
989321	992401	Universal Studios and all that is all relatively in the same area.
992421	993562	It's all north of downtown.
994102	995062	I kind of want to go.
995382	995962	I know, right?
996162	997463	So, yeah.
998583	1002085	S200 Matt says, yeah, isn't there a Pokemon event coming up where they're going to show off Z-Day?
1002385	1004986	There's always a Pokemon thing at the end of February.
1005106	1008347	I don't know if that's the anniversary of Pokemon, but it marks some sort of event.
1008747	1012969	So it's expected we will see more Pokemon Legends footage soon.
1013314	1014014	It's expected.
1014034	1018136	That doesn't mean we'll get it, but it's expected we're going to see more of that towards the end of February.
1019077	1020857	So with that.
1021217	1023579	But, you know, Pokemon obviously has all these other things are doing well.
1024319	1026900	The trading card pocket game, which I think we have a story on later.
1026940	1029781	And, oh, the trading card game itself.
1030301	1031082	My goodness.
1031122	1034403	Have you seen these videos of people fighting at Costco over trade?
1034843	1040126	Like it's Black Friday or something, but it's these Pokemon trading card releases.
1040726	1045830	and they roll out the pallet at Costco and grown men fighting each other over these things so they can sell them on eBay.
1045890	1046731	It's so silly.
1046771	1047071	Yeah.
1047351	1047611	Yeah.
1047892	1048552	It's ridiculous.
1048572	1048932	Whatever.
1048952	1049413	Yeah.
1050894	1055737	Unfortunately, that was one of the last videos I saw on TikTok before it hit the shitter.
1056018	1057399	No, I know it's back.
1058920	1060501	Y'all think I'm never on the internet.
1060541	1061381	I know it's back.
1061862	1064523	But it's just, you know, obviously we were down for a little bit.
1065044	1070167	Funny enough, do you know, legit, hand to God, do you know what the last video was I saw on TikTok?
1070187	1072649	Because remember they pulled it early, like two hours ago?
1072989	1075291	Or two hours, not two hours ago, two hours before it was supposed to.
1075851	1080858	Hand to God, the last thing that came up on my algorithm before that pop-up that said, sorry, we're going dark, came up.
1081859	1083542	It was one of DarkSakura's Dead by Daylight.
1084674	1085034	really?
1085435	1085975	which one?
1086976	1111533	I don't remember retrospect now because I was too flustered at the closure you were on Ormond or the new one or something oh probably one of the pet the dog ones oh it might have been but yeah it did crack me up I was like oh legit Jamie's talk is the last thing I see before it all goes to hell so anyway Loki what else on the Switch 2?
1111573	1112294	anything else?
1113626	1115968	Mario Kart looks cool.
1116449	1121052	People have been speculating, obviously, just based off of what little footage in there.
1121192	1121733	We love that.
1122874	1126216	Well, yeah, I mean, the first thing I noticed was the tracks look huge.
1126416	1131881	Like, just at least the one that they showed off, it looks absolutely much larger than normal stuff.
1132441	1139647	And going along with that, people have spotted that there are 24 starting line positions for
1141548	1146991	Alluding to 24 players, maybe, which is a lot more than what we get right now.
1147011	1148052	Isn't that like double, I think?
1148672	1150953	Or I don't know what it's up to if it's 12 or I think it's 12.
1151093	1152634	I think it is 12.
1152674	1156876	But I think when you're all playing on one console, I don't think you can have more than eight on one console.
1157176	1163920	Because I remember something about the Bluetooth noise wouldn't handle more than eight for any game.
1164700	1192876	which you know because my my first instinct was like oh I wonder if you're I wonder if you'll be able to have just like fucking massive amounts of Mario Kart players in one room you know all play and then I was like wait a minute I think there was a thing with like Bluetooth noise and they they actually had to limit it at eight uh because of that issue now who know maybe you know technology's come a long way since the original Switch maybe they found a way to reduce the noise but I I don't know how much stock I put on that so it seems to indicate there will definitely be some type of like online sort of functionality
1193496	1200903	and it definitely indicates we better be getting Baby Park with 24 racers on it.
1201303	1204386	I need Baby Park with 24 racers on it.
1204586	1206828	It's going to be so ridiculous.
1207009	1207669	I can't wait.
1207889	1210152	That's the whole reason to play a game like that.
1210732	1212694	Baby Park should have been the track they showed.
1215096	1218139	Tiger Class says, could the new Mario Kart have tracks based on the movie?
1218199	1218820	Sure, it could.
1221026	1237685	you know I well there have already been people you know again going down the rabbit hole that Donkey Kong looks more like movie Donkey Kong than he does you know original so sure I mean why not and I'm not I'm not saying that to be sarcastic so yeah why why not do the
1238205	1238826	Here's the thing, too.
1239406	1242588	You know, folks, these games have been in development for a while.
1243308	1253493	You know, a lot of that stuff, the movie stuff, could have been based off of the designs that they had already for the actual games and characters.
1253573	1257135	So it could be that the game actually did inform the movie.
1257175	1260997	So maybe the Mario Brothers movie was secretly a Mario Kart Direct the whole time.
1262618	1262838	Maybe.
1263879	1264179	We down.
1264199	1264459	We down.
1266929	1268590	Let's get some Mad Max carts in there.
1268910	1269390	Heck yeah.
1269831	1274093	I think Mario Kart is such a good fucking game to launch a system with, though.
1275134	1276975	Obviously, it's one of Nintendo's best games.
1277375	1284319	I like that there's a lot going on here that Nintendo is just admitting, this is what works.
1284799	1285699	Let's just do it.
1286180	1292403	I feel like the console itself, even just calling it Nintendo Switch 2, which I do believe is the final name.
1292463	1295625	Bobby and I were having a little bit of a riff because he was saying he doesn't...
1295985	1297646	But he's saying he doesn't think it's the final name.
1297666	1299146	I said, eh, it's in the press release.
1299426	1302227	But to be fair, if you scrape the trademark database, it doesn't come up yet.
1302307	1303527	But that's a slow process.
1303767	1306308	But I do think that's the name.
1306348	1307008	And why not?
1307508	1312830	I've seen a surprising amount of discourse over the name, but I'm like, it works for PlayStation.
1312970	1313330	It works.
1313430	1314911	for iPhones and Pixels.
1315011	1316112	It works for everything else.
1316272	1322777	I like that Nintendo is leaning into just what works and giving us more of it.
1323198	1326300	I really think this is what people have wanted for a long time.
1326360	1327842	They want Mario in 4K.
1327882	1329983	They want Mario Kart in 4K.
1330323	1336348	And Mario Kart is Nintendo's biggest, Mario Kart 8 anyway, has been Nintendo's biggest game of like the last 10 years.
1336729	1340732	So yes, of course, this is a great fucking idea to launch a console with it.
1341587	1344549	Yeah, and what's funny, though, is, like, people are already judging it.
1344589	1346470	Their logo's just too much the same.
1346531	1349332	It's like, we don't even know how any of this functions right now.
1349352	1350733	You just know what it looks like.
1350753	1352415	I'm disappointed.
1352535	1353916	Like, oh, well, too bad.
1353976	1354816	No one cares.
1356578	1359660	No one cares that you're disappointed by pictures in a trailer.
1361129	1361650	And you know what?
1361710	1362490	Don't buy one.
1362730	1363451	Don't buy one.
1364592	1365793	Leave some for the rest of us.
1366153	1370757	If you are going on the internet saying Mario Kart looks too samesy, you know what?
1370777	1371878	Do us all a favor.
1372439	1373019	All a favor.
1373379	1374060	Don't buy one.
1374580	1374941	Please.
1375301	1379765	Because then there will be more for the rest of us to pre-order and have our hands on.
1379865	1385790	But I'm hoping this long lead time and all of these hardware releases and all this stuff...
1386090	1387492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1407893	1408874	We'll see, we'll see.
1408894	1417458	I mean, we don't know until they really unveil the curtain on it because you can't trust leakers and all of that stuff.
1419819	1422361	So, yeah, the Mario Kart game looks sweet.
1424295	1425815	What have the rumors also been saying?
1425835	1428357	There's a lot of third-party stuff that's been confirmed, right?
1428397	1435300	Like things that were on PS4 and PS5 that skipped the original Switch probably because of lack of power, right?
1435821	1440163	So like the Star Wars games have been rumored for Switch 2, right?
1441764	1442784	I haven't heard anything.
1442864	1445586	There's got to be a No Man's Sky update.
1446126	1447227	I will be shocked.
1448109	1452074	if there's not a No Man's Sky release for Switch 2 that leans into everything.
1452134	1457020	Not just a backwards compatible, but like an actual Switch 2 release that leans into the power of that console.
1457080	1459884	I would be absolutely shocked if they don't have something like that.
1460645	1460885	I don't know.
1460925	1461986	I'm just excited for it.
1462046	1463428	It's nice to finally be excited for...
1464349	1487769	some things like I don't know it's just like like I'm so sick of the overanalyze I mean this is what we do but like I'm so sick of like the overanalyzing everything from like a two minute trailer people like already saying oh I'm disappointed like what is it that you wanted like what what possible thing I don't know it's just it's just silly but I hope there's good games and I hope it's a good launch
1488937	1493979	Bob Coffee in chat, I love this, says, Internet pre-Switch announcement.
1494339	1498120	We want Nintendo stuff in 4K, Internet after Switch trailer.
1498500	1500641	Why can't Nintendo do crazy stuff like Wii U?
1501441	1503061	The Internet doesn't know what it wants.
1503101	1503862	No one's happy.
1505662	1506442	On the Internet?
1506802	1508183	No one is ever satisfied?
1508383	1508983	Are you sure?
1509843	1511784	The point of the Internet is to not be happy.
1514321	1518526	Only a few of us are allowed to be happy and we're in the corner with the possum memes.
1518646	1520828	It's called doom scrolling, not happy scrolling.
1521268	1522550	Listen, folks.
1524011	1526074	With the state of the world that it's in...
1528908	1537653	I'll take just a plain, you know, new Nintendo console with no frills and just, it's just better than the last one.
1537713	1539053	Yes, this is what I want.
1539233	1540114	Like, yes, do it.
1540194	1544336	And, you know, I'm fine because they already said they're keeping Nintendo Switch Online, right?
1544376	1546737	Like, that's already been something they've confirmed, right?
1546757	1548418	Nintendo Switch Online is still going to be a thing here.
1548718	1550639	Well, if it's backwards compatible, it has to be.
1550719	1552580	Like, that library would just move over.
1552981	1557083	And I am A-OK with that because it means they're not going to drip feed all this shit again.
1557563	1566468	They either have to add new things or, well, maybe they just have to add new things such as DS games that maybe you can play vertical.
1566948	1567629	Wii games.
1568309	1568830	Heck yeah.
1568990	1569590	Psych truck.
1570370	1571331	GameCube games.
1572172	1572672	Hell yeah.
1573012	1573512	But we'll see.
1573592	1574253	We'll see, you know.
1577155	1599606	we'll have to just wait until April and that's just the way it's going to be we have to wait until early April to find out more but then literally the week after they show that people are going to be getting their hands on it at these different events fifth dream physical Switch cards will fit it is backwards compatible with the cartridges it's just there's going to be some games that are Switch 2 only games yes
1602041	1603522	It's like a CD and a DVD.
1603582	1608484	The DVD drive will still read the CDs, but there's also DVDs that will only work not on a CD drive.
1609464	1611465	There, I made a reference for you, 30 and 40-somethings.
1613486	1613886	Let's see.
1615327	1627312	Something else I kind of wanted to say about all this, which I am assuming here, but I think it is safe to do so, that you're going to have a similar infrastructure with eShop and all that so that your digital library...
1627952	1634614	which for some of us is pretty big, should come right over to Switch 2 and Switch 2 should have more memory so you can have more of it.
1635234	1639835	Let's just hope that they do a better job of their online store with the new one.
1639895	1641815	Okay, so did you hear this?
1641835	1645376	Because Bobby went over this on his show, but I saw this same thing on Blue Sky.
1645436	1650457	So one of our people that hang out here on VOG, it was OrangeRite that did this, right?
1651038	1652138	OrangeRite or was it QuestBuster?
1653072	1653673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1662322	1664864	created their better eShop.
1665545	1668848	But what they did was that they... And they said, we made it in a week.
1668928	1670829	It's a better eShop, and we did it in a week.
1671810	1682479	And what happened was that they've labeled all these games, categorized them, but they've labeled... They're like, we're trying to thin out the shovelware.
1682499	1683400	Okay, it was orange, right?
1683460	1683760	Thank you.
1684201	1684421	Okay.
1685141	1685222	Um...
1685842	1686562	And then repost it.
1686582	1689284	But your bleat is how I saw it, okay?
1689784	1695207	So they labeled a bunch of games based on what they've reviewed and so forth.
1695247	1699709	But they said they're trying to cut down on the amount of shovelware that's on the platform.
1699749	1703651	Because that is Nintendo eShop's worst problem is the amount of shovelware on it.
1703891	1708854	But the problem is they kind of classified everything by default as shovelware.
1709494	1715382	So when you go into the shovelware category, it's like all of these games that aren't necessarily bad.
1715862	1722971	And again, as Bobby pointed out, I saw one that Orange Rite had highlighted that kind of ticked me off because I know the person that made it.
1723412	1726156	And so I was like, uh, that's not shovelware.
1726556	1728236	Grow Up, you know, type of thing.
1728256	1736978	And to Orange Wright's credit, he was highlighting, I think he was doing like highlighting these games that should be, or should not be shovelware.
1737018	1738038	They are actually decent games.
1738238	1741679	Because I remember he pulled out Pix the Cat, which was a decent place.
1741739	1742839	I don't call that shovelware.
1742859	1749660	It was a decent indie Pac-Man inspired early PlayStation title, PS4 type title.
1750800	1753621	So there's all these games that are just called shovelware, which is a bunch of bull.
1754321	1755503	because these games are not shoveled.
1755543	1757325	They are uncategorized games.
1757725	1762471	You have not had the time to go in and properly categorize them, so you're throwing them all in as shovelware.
1762552	1764674	Bobby pointed out there was a P-Cross game in there.
1765055	1767878	One of Nintendo's own franchises is shovelware?
1768885	1783327	grow up as a complete... I'm sorry because I know it seems like it's such a small thing, but to the people that work very hard on developing their games and doing all this stuff, this shows why a lot of this shit is harder than you think.
1783648	1786388	And when you're up there going, look at us, we did it better in a week.
1786568	1787068	Did you?
1787508	1793969	Because for a lot of people, you did it a lot worse by doing them a disservice by calling it shovelware.
1794309	1797510	And that whole idea was extremely immature.
1798939	1826494	and I realize it's the internet there's a lot of immature shit on the internet but if you want to be taken seriously by the big boys like Nintendo you need to act like a grown up and calling all these things shovelware is not acting like a grown up and I might be sounding like a bitch right now but guess what when Nintendo stops sending you advanced copies of things when you act like a bitch you deserve to be bitched how about that that
1827259	1827779	Listen to her.
1851155	1852595	How about a categorized fuck you?
1873526	1892892	and there would be a lot of indie developers that would say that Deft in chat says they did it unintentionally but at the same time they totally did a disservice to all the indie devs out there who put out legit and fun stuff just because they wanted to push it ASAP without actually curating the thing ding ding ding gold star comment that's it that's the problem
1893832	1900561	And, you know, again, is it really a better eShop when you are just poo-pooing away these indie games?
1900621	1905347	And were there, yeah, there's like 8,000 games in that shovelware.
1905427	1907110	Are some of them actually shovelware?
1907690	1907991	Sure.
1908551	1909052	Sure they are.
1910017	1926479	but guess what not all of them and you're doing a huge disservice to the ones that aren't and I'm okay I am okay I will say this they had a category for like asset flip or something like that which were just games that very clearly just flipped assets in the Unity store and did that whole thing I am
1928266	1929547	A little more okay with that.
1929627	1937993	I do still hope there is some curation there because just because somebody bought a pre-done pack of texture pack thing doesn't make the game bad.
1938113	1939354	I'm going to use an example here.
1939654	1944977	So we used to talk a lot about an AR game, not by Niantic, called Orna, right?
1945277	1946738	You remember when we used to talk about that game a lot?
1946859	1951302	Orna is an AR game and it's like an 8-bit or maybe 16-bit RPG, but it's in the real world.
1951582	1952362	And you go out and do that.
1952402	1957726	And they put out an offline version of Orna called Aetheric or something like that.
1958447	1966016	That uses like a sprite pack that you can buy in one of those things, you know, and they made it and you'll see those same sprites in other games.
1966417	1972405	So just because they had to use a pack to get it doesn't make the game bad by nature.
1974215	1999776	something else to consider and I don't know to what extent you know again because I'm not claiming to have the better eShop or whatever I'm not going through and categorizing I don't know what extent they have but I really hope they haven't categorized things as asset flips that are actually relatively original ideas that just yeah they the person that wanted to make their game was not an artist so they they used pre-done packs I don't think that's a big deal
2000609	2001689	as long as the game's innovative.
2001809	2002990	Some artists got paid for it.
2003890	2004710	Yeah, that's right.
2004790	2005630	The artists who made it.
2006250	2009611	As long as it was through official stores and not AI.
2009691	2011572	That's the label y'all need to have.
2012172	2013792	AI art.
2014072	2015993	That's the label we gotta look out for in the future.
2020354	2021394	Anything else on Switch 2?
2021974	2024635	I know we've got a lot of tangents, but hey, it's a big story this week.
2025259	2025539	Looks cool.
2025559	2026840	I want to wait for more information.
2049963	2051563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2072489	2078831	If it runs original Switch games better, and I'm not expecting that to happen, although I am kind of hoping.
2078991	2080112	I'm crossing my fingers on my toes.
2080632	2083873	If it runs original Switch games better, that's all I need.
2083933	2085133	Those are my three games right there.
2085313	2087294	I'll buy it just to play...
2087834	2092777	Last Generation's Pokemon games, Scarlet Vite, just to play those a little better with a little bit enhanced performance.
2093117	2095358	That right there makes Switch 2 a must-have.
2096239	2097740	Pokemon Legends, same thing.
2098100	2102642	But I'm so fucking there for Legends Z to A. I already know, like, it's fine.
2102742	2103143	I already know.
2103403	2106865	Mario Kart, Legends Z A, Metroid Prime 4.
2107025	2107485	Say less.
2107545	2108145	I've seen enough.
2108185	2108686	I'm buying it.
2110347	2112208	That's all I need.
2112428	2117431	But again, these are literally all more of the same, and I'm fine with it.
2117472	2124696	But I will show love to the indies, too, as those games pop up and show up on my radar, as always.
2125077	2127478	Okay, thank you.
2127558	2128759	Deft agrees with me in chat.
2128799	2129159	Thank you.
2129199	2132562	If Pokemon Scarlet Violet runs way better and smoother, day one.
2132662	2133142	Exactly.
2133222	2134063	That's all you need.
2134243	2135183	That's really all you need.
2135263	2136404	Run the Switch games better.
2137045	2137365	Done.
2137865	2138425	Done and done.
2138686	2138906	Alright.
2139846	2141066	Let's move on and talk about the types.
2142087	2143387	Maybe we'd get a good Dead by Daylight.
2144607	2150089	Yeah, I don't see why Dead by Daylight wouldn't release a Switch 2 tuned version.
2150549	2154130	You know, there's a lot of jokes on Twitch and the Twitch community.
2154170	2157410	I'm sure you've heard these or made these too about when you have a killer.
2157430	2158291	You're playing on Switch.
2158331	2158851	I'm sorry.
2159451	2160391	It's not just you're playing on Switch.
2160411	2162612	You're playing on Switch on the McDonald's Wi-Fi.
2162892	2168233	That's where some killers... I have actually seen Hex Switch Player.
2170526	2170926	That's good.
2172407	2175149	Except you can't make that your name on the Switch.
2175349	2176210	I guess you could.
2176911	2178071	You can name your me.
2178151	2180853	I guess you can rename your account on the Switch.
2181394	2183635	I've never thought I don't have Dead by Daylight on the Switch.
2184116	2192882	That's one of those games, with as much as I buy certain games over and over, that's one of the games I don't necessarily feel You can have other profiles on your account too.
2193762	2194663	Oh, that's a good thought.
2194803	2195624	Okay, true.
2196144	2196824	Alright.
2197705	2202966	Alright, well speaking of Dead by Daylight, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things that we have been playing this week.
2203046	2204047	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2205667	2206687	Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight.
2206787	2208628	I'm going to be playing more Dead by Daylight tonight.
2210208	2220230	Also on Thursday, instead of playing Dead by Daylight, Shayla and I had a complete two-person vote and we decided to play Palia because fuck Dead by Daylight for a minute.
2220370	2222271	Oh yeah, I saw your Palia thing, yeah.
2223141	2225142	It got kind of toxic.
2225522	2228063	People were being shitty, so we were just like, we're not going to deal with it.
2229583	2232424	I've been playing Dragon Age The Veil Guard, of course.
2232464	2233525	I'm on my second playthrough.
2233545	2243748	I am trying to do everything I did not do my first playthrough, like the things that I kind of sped through parts of the game and missed, so I'm getting that done.
2244588	2248810	There's this cool scene where you just go grocery shopping with Lucanus, and I love it.
2248850	2249590	It's very charming.
2252618	2256622	I also played a little Bellatro today.
2257202	2261307	I'm not addicted to it, no matter what people like to tease about.
2261607	2270636	I play the game like maybe on Sunday for an hour while I'm watching YouTube videos with Dan, which is literally what happened today.
2272450	2277194	Um, I am playing Fruit Mountain, which I'm still kind of hooked on.
2277494	2280796	I am playing Moonlight Mahjong, just because it's my stress relief game.
2281297	2284759	Like, I'm actually gonna label, name the stuff I've been playing, like, for real.
2284859	2291824	I've also been playing, uh, uh, the, uh, Suika game a bit.
2292165	2296208	I don't know why, I just really, it's relaxing and frustrating at the same time.
2297488	2299190	Um, I am...
2301088	2327273	I'm working on I was telling Loki about this earlier I'm going to finally finish up my project management thing and get into a Unity course to actually check on Unity and Swift integration to make nothing but UI stuff, UI UX stuff to practice for a position I want to apply for at work and
2329837	2353933	just like I'm actually and I even have a visual novel designer but I'm working my comic as a visual novel style basically it's just going to be animated and autoplayed I've got stuff in line I've got things going on but those are most of what I've been playing
2357822	2381548	and I'm still trying to I went looking to buy a game specifically and it's way out of my budget but I've been looking for a copy of Vibripple affordably now I did buy a Japanese Umjamur Lami which should be on its way so I can play in hell I'm on this Nana Onsha kick
2383042	2407366	I've just been watching Mojibribbon and Parappa playthroughs and Parappa remixes I don't even know how that happened, but it happened and I'm just sort of going with it I'm glad I'm not the only person in this universe that has trouble on Cheep Cheep's level
2409643	2436436	um you know talking about getting new games makes me think you know um Alan and I are sort of lightly starting to explore this idea so I don't know if you know this DarkSakura but um we actually uh so when we it was a couple years ago DarkSakura actually gave us old couches an old couch and an old love seat that her and Dan had I'm sad to say those finally went to couch heaven they'd seen better years they were they were they were they were past their prime um so we actually replaced with they were really comfortable though when we got them
2436656	2442198	Yeah, just, you know, over the years, they started to, you could, like, feel the metal, and it was like, oh, okay, it's time to get stuff.
2442338	2444299	You know, we've been pretty fortunate with our day jobs and stuff.
2444319	2446540	You know, the decision to buy those was the nap test.
2447160	2447401	Yeah.
2447881	2450662	I literally took a nap in the store.
2451162	2452022	No, they served us.
2452042	2453863	And because... Yeah.
2453963	2454203	Go ahead.
2454263	2456344	I was going to say, they served us well, and we're thankful.
2457225	2457405	Yeah.
2458865	2459105	Yeah.
2459305	2460406	But... Well, um...
2462383	2463784	I was going to say about the purchasing.
2464144	2466606	We bought a new couch and all that.
2466646	2471270	So we actually have like an L-shaped one for our house now to kind of fit the room and all that.
2471790	2477214	Some of you may have snuck a picture of it because there's a picture of Cheddar I think that Alan put up that's actually on the new furniture.
2477574	2480597	But anyway, but we also, we didn't just get rid of that.
2480797	2483078	We got rid of an old recliner that I had for my parents.
2483098	2485880	We got rid of the coffee table that just didn't seem better years.
2486221	2489643	We got rid of a futon that we had that was upstairs and kind of seemed better.
2489683	2491765	We purged a lot of stuff and actually felt really good.
2492205	2498626	But now because we have all that space downstairs, we're thinking about getting a new coffee table.
2499046	2506688	But this has gone to, should we be those people and get a cocktail cabinet table?
2507268	2520030	And specifically maybe one of those built... I was actually thinking what Bobby Blackwolf has in his basement, how he has the custom machine and the custom pinball thing, but maybe a custom...
2521030	2522051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2549108	2556155	So that's, that's my long winded way of saying you were talking about like what the buy games, I'm, we're thinking about picking up a piece of furniture like that.
2556435	2562782	It probably won't be right away because we've, we, you know, we spend enough money on the furniture, but maybe after a few months we save some more money, maybe something like that.
2563322	2566705	So I'm just going to have you keep some things in mind.
2566725	2567186	Mm hmm.
2568580	2596765	maintenance cost and will you be able to use storage as well so those are the things we had talked about getting a coffee table I mean right now it's not going to work with all the stuff that we have that we're organizing but I was more thinking of having one of those lift top ones and making it a board gaming table with like a removable area for dice rolling and stuff like that
2597967	2598447	Yeah, that's it.
2622697	2648055	eventually because we don't really need the kitchen table that we have currently that's also very very old our kitchen tables you've had that one for like ever uh-huh and that's that's like actually we probably would have gotten rid of that too if we hadn't like filled up the junk hauler with all this other crap because we got we had so much other like just like giant arcade one-up boxes we hadn't been able to break it can't fit in our face it's just like things that just needed to go it felt really good to purge all that stuff so
2649164	2650546	Anyway, we were on gateways.
2650586	2652628	We're in the middle of the office purge.
2652769	2656213	But I mean, but I have to say, I found things doing my office purge.
2657354	2658636	I found Famicom games.
2659116	2659857	Oh my god, nice.
2660458	2661599	I found a WaterSwan game.
2662180	2662941	That's, what game?
2664343	2664843	Final Fantasy 2.
2665304	2665624	Nice.
2666706	2667026	Perfect.
2667166	2667567	It's like...
2668462	2692135	where did i and then like and then like i remember oh yeah i bought this here and like stuff that i picked up at like twitch con and i found a lanyard of disneyland pins and the big pin on the bottom of it said it's i'm celebrating and it says my guinness world record oh you went that recently
2693968	2695129	It was after TwitchCon.
2695850	2696730	Oh, right.
2696871	2697771	Okay, yeah.
2698052	2699173	Yeah, that would have been after all that.
2699233	2699573	Okay.
2699893	2701034	And it was that one.
2701214	2703296	And I'm like, ah!
2703356	2704737	I can't, yeah, put this aside.
2704777	2707079	I need to laminate it so that the stuff doesn't wear off.
2708661	2708981	Alright.
2709561	2709762	Nice.
2711123	2712984	Alright, we were in Gaming Week, so I'm sorry.
2713325	2714085	I was the one who derailed that.
2714105	2715807	But did you have anything else here in Gaming Week, DarkSakura?
2717448	2719009	Um, no.
2719330	2720671	Alright, then Loki, how was your Gaming Week?
2722233	2749991	I was working just basically trying to get the water ride done in my theme park and it is working I don't want to say done I keep like nothing is ever done I have more art assets I have to make but functionally it works and it is done it just needs I've been polishing this thing for like months now but it is improving
2750490	2751971	It'll be very impressive.
2752071	2755174	Everybody that I've shown it to has been blown away by what it is.
2756074	2759136	It is essentially a theme park ride.
2759256	2766402	It is like you went to Disneyland and rode a splash mountain or something like that.
2767574	2768014	and DarkSakura.
2790715	2796462	The owner of the lumber mill is this beaver guy named Doug Beaverton.
2796742	2807055	I was channeling Doug Dimmadome from the Fairly Oddparents for this character, so he essentially found that you can mix, like,
2808393	2825528	TreeSap and Honey and possibly bees to make an energy drink and then these raccoons got into that energy drink and now they're bouncing all over the place and so making a mess of things and you have to essentially tranquilize them with darts to um
2826289	2828410	You know, stop them from destroying the place.
2829011	2855227	And so the whole ride goes through, like, the outside of the lumber mill, through the lumber mill, up the mountain, through some caves, and then into this raccoon city that's inside of, not really raccoon city, gotta call it raccoon town because everybody gets confused with raccoon city and Resident Evil, but it goes through this, like, shanty town inside of there, and it's just kind of this whole story that goes along through there, and that Doug Beaverton character is
2856167	2863869	as an animatronic throughout the ride, like kind of making weird comments about things and funny quotes and stuff.
2863929	2868931	So it's just, I don't know, it feels like an actual water ride.
2868971	2880074	And mixing some of the mods that we had to allow for custom audio and that type of thing and custom models that I've made in the game, it really just...
2881331	2881811	Sells it.
2881992	2883633	The vibes are there for it.
2883733	2899525	So I think once it gets in the video, which will be soon, I was originally going to put this out and then do another video for the rest of the park, but I am just at this point just trying to get everything done because we have our world tour day, which is essentially on the 8th.
2899545	2899665	And...
2902677	2917072	so everything has to be done by then so I was doing the Wild West area today and finishing that up that wasn't quite finished because the guy that was helping me with that he started it and it's like half done so I have to finish all that but it's
2917853	2918474	It's really cool.
2918754	2919395	That's all I can say.
2919415	2922157	The video will be coming out hopefully soon.
2923299	2924740	Like I said, there's just lots of stuff.
2925280	2927102	All of it unrelated to Minecraft right now.
2927122	2934289	I have to create a lot of custom assets like billboards and stuff and signs and everything and Photoshop and all that.
2934390	2934550	But...
2937162	2949589	it's gonna, I think it's something that no one's ever done before to this level and it's a water ride too which I've never seen that done in Minecraft and it's funny though, the guy that inspired me this
2950896	2951136	DINGYFREED
2969455	2992249	in the functionality of it and everything and all the redstone behind it actually tracks the score up to 10 boats at a time so you can have 10 riders on which is the maximum that can fit in the ride at any given time and it will track their scores individually as it goes through the ride and then display it at the end on this three digit seven segment display it's just crazy yeah
2993757	3004729	so look forward to that soon and I'll let everybody know but I am so glad to be done with that part but still not I'll be even more relieved when everything is done
3007287	3007587	Alright.
3008408	3010569	Well, if that's it, let's see my gaming week.
3011849	3013350	You know, the usual stuff that I play.
3013390	3014110	World of Warcraft.
3014170	3015351	I got a second character to level 80.
3015391	3018492	Yay, I have a disc priest now at 80 as well as a holy pally.
3018832	3019613	I love healers.
3020973	3022154	So, yeah, there's that.
3022274	3024335	And then I even played a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV again.
3024375	3028717	It had actually been a while since I played, but somebody asked me to play and I was like, sure, I'll come play for a little bit.
3028737	3031318	And I was like, oh, juggling two MMOs is very hard.
3031738	3034480	I probably will let WoW go when there's something kind of...
3035020	3036080	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3061468	3062029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3078187	3086952	I also was playing the original, or I should say the NES version, not the original, but the NES version, this custom ROM of Pac-Man Championship Edition.
3087312	3095256	And I remember playing that in one of the Pac-Man, I think it was in that most recent Pac-Man collection that came out on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, all that stuff.
3095596	3099858	They actually did a demake of Pac-Man Championship Edition, and it's actually really good.
3099978	3100639	It's really cute.
3101019	3102600	And so that ROM's been fun to play.
3103720	3106382	And I actually was, part of what kind of...
3107122	3135306	spawned that whole thing is I was randomly playing Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 which is a game that's a few years old at this point but I was randomly playing that game on my Steam Deck because you know I'm like visiting things on my Steam Deck uh just you know that play well and yeah I was like oh this game is still kind of fun like I know it wasn't received super well because the ghosts on rails mechanic kind of is weird I kind of I do understand why they did it but it does make the game a little difficult sometimes but um yeah I've been enjoying it so yeah
3135626	3136886	That's pretty much it for my game of the week.
3137486	3142967	So, alright, with that, we will move on into other stories going on tonight.
3143107	3144988	So, let's get into it.
3145608	3148108	Loki, what's going on at Sony's?
3149068	3151149	More cancelled live service games.
3151529	3162531	And some of these, I mean, I don't know if we really knew a lot of these were coming, because they don't sound good, but they've been cancelled, so I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
3163071	3164651	So, apparently...
3166195	3187848	the uh there was a couple games canceled by Ben Studios and Bluepoint Games according to a report by Bloomberg and these the two projects that they were working on were these online live service games one of them was a live service spinoff of the God of War franchise you um and
3189584	3191286	Well, they put the name on it to sell it.
3191386	3196711	Like, you know, that's... It would have been just... To guarantee sales, they put God of War's name on it.
3196751	3197291	That's what it was.
3198673	3199794	Yeah.
3199874	3210003	They said, you know, Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studio families and we're working closely with each studio to determine what the next projects are.
3211484	3212325	And then apparently...
3213444	3213824	Let's see.
3213964	3218686	Yeah, we don't know what the other game was, but of course, you know, Ben Studios had done Days Gone before.
3218706	3227770	I don't know if it's maybe a spinoff of that, but I guess they learned their lesson with Concord, maybe?
3228450	3230091	And they're kind of pulling back a little bit.
3231691	3232131	We'll see.
3232512	3233472	I don't know, but...
3234909	3237330	I think it's a mistake to go all in on live service games.
3237671	3240552	Yeah, that was... I know that's tempting, but... Definitely an error on their part.
3240632	3242873	I mean, not all live service games are terrible.
3243714	3245535	I played Diablo 4 as a live service game.
3245955	3246715	I really enjoy it.
3246776	3250398	You know, there's other games that, you know, and some people enjoy Destiny, or at least used to.
3251318	3255320	And there's, you know, there's other things that people really enjoy.
3256181	3261023	Marvel Rivals is a live service game that a lot of people are playing lately.
3261083	3261624	You know, there's...
3262284	3267226	There are good ones out there that people enjoy, but it's just their whole idea to flood the market.
3267326	3268487	Everything's got to be live service.
3268507	3269548	I think that was a poor decision.
3269848	3271328	The God of War game might have been decent.
3272409	3276751	We might actually be looking at a case of, unfortunately, it's the reverse.
3276871	3281713	Now because this game did poorly, this game that might have been alright got thrown out as well.
3281834	3283014	That is a bummer.
3283034	3283654	It might have been okay.
3285100	3303749	so apparently according to screenshots that were DMCA'd taken down from the website that was reporting that the Ben Studio game that they were working on looked like it was a military shooter game so like a Call of Duty or something like that alright, sure
3307773	3315642	On a somewhat related note, I've been seeing this headline going around talking about the game industry would love Grand Theft Auto 6 to cost $100.
3319847	3319987	Who?
3320007	3320607	Oh, I mean, it's...
3339554	3341116	Online, they make billions of dollars.
3341156	3343980	This is why they haven't made a new Grand Theft Auto game until now.
3344681	3351171	And, like, honestly, the whole argument that, like, well, games aren't profitable anymore, and so we have to raise the price, you know, it's like, well...
3352270	3368027	No, see, because when I bought a game, let's just say an $80 game back on the Super Nintendo or something like that, that's not the same as a $70 game that's coming out now, but then a $30 season pass, and then more microtransactions on top of that.
3368147	3371631	It's like the Super Nintendo game did not have the ability to...
3372492	3372792	DarkSakura,
3389083	3394870	Those tapes, the VHS tapes, cost upwards to like $120 a tape.
3395150	3402698	It was very expensive because they are selling it for the intent and purpose of rental, and so therefore the price of that is...
3403686	3408030	I mean, they just probably marked it up so they can make a ton of money off of it, but that's what it was for.
3408190	3408850	Backing it up.
3408930	3418418	Not that anybody thinks you're lying, but I remember because that first job I had was at a video store, and when customers lost tapes, it blew their fucking mind that, like, yeah, the lost tape fee is, you know, $120.
3418458	3418778	It was like, what?
3420760	3420980	What?
3421060	3424064	But these tapes are like $20 at Walmart.
3424784	3425906	You lost a movie.
3425926	3428468	We had a big book that showed all the going prices of everything.
3428789	3435996	And some movie, like Jurassic Park, some of the things that were really consumed massively were priced for sale immediately.
3436036	3439160	I think something like Jurassic Park was only $20 when it came out.
3439300	3440461	Every household had that movie.
3440981	3441862	Most movies were...
3442663	3464208	that what you're talking about like rental and sell through is what they called it so rental the movie prices were much higher and then sell through it was basically you know that you could sell it for 20 bucks and that's what the price was so it eventually comes down in price after that rental window or whatever uh that thing changed with like a dvd and uh blu-ray of course but
3465311	3472438	The point being, though, is a lot of these higher-priced games, yeah, they may be at a higher price up front, but they're not getting you on the back end with all this stuff.
3472539	3478605	Whereas, like, a $70 game from Rockstar, like, they're not going to have microtransactions.
3478625	3483029	They made billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars on Grand Theft Auto Online.
3483329	3486573	I mean, this is a game that unnecessarily charges you for rent.
3487113	3488814	for maintaining your garage.
3489194	3491516	That doesn't need to be a gameplay element in the game.
3491536	3499221	They put it in there because they're making you grind for this and they're making it so that you want to buy these shark cards because that's where they're making all their money.
3499541	3501262	So like, I don't, yeah, sure.
3501423	3515512	The rest of the industry, probably Ubisoft as well, you know, would love it if the base price could be $100 because then they could just slap, you know, their pirate game that has literally no effort put into it and charge $100 and call it a quintuple A game.
3516112	3516953	And, you know,
3517473	3518915	Be the end of that.
3518935	3520556	Make another $30 on their game.
3520896	3524519	Something like Grand Theft Auto 6 could probably get away with it.
3524599	3528042	Something like Final Fantasy 17 could probably get away with it.
3528062	3530844	Something like Mario Kart, quite honestly, could probably get away with it.
3530904	3539712	But the problem is, you want to complain about lack of innovation in the gaming space, you have these other type of games that would never fetch that kind of money.
3540272	3544796	And the reality is, the gaming space is competing against, for all those games, you have your $20 Bellatro.
3547097	3548198	$5 Vampire Survivors.
3549218	3560181	Games run the gamut of costs now, and I think it is much more important for companies to be able to show that value for what they're asking for up front.
3560261	3562062	It's also like this open secret, like
3562842	3567024	I don't know about you all, I never buy Mortal Kombat games at launch anymore.
3567384	3567964	Why would I?
3568384	3569325	I know they're going to cost $70.
3570325	3572046	They're going to nickel and dime for every character.
3572406	3579289	And eventually, maybe I'll have to wait two to three years, but eventually there's going to be a version that comes out that's $40 for fucking everything.
3579569	3580590	That's the version I'll get.
3580650	3581290	Thank you very much.
3582110	3583591	And I think we all know that now.
3584451	3595218	Yeah, and you have to remember now, like, as the sales charts have shown, and, you know, to the chagrin, I guess, of Sony and stuff, so here's another fun fact here, too.
3595799	3596259	Oh, fine.
3597080	3603624	So, you know, all of these companies are charging, like, you know, $70 for their games, because games are too expensive.
3604425	3609889	Mind you, that they are selling the far majority of them on their own...
3610849	3612592	own digital platform.
3613173	3619663	Now that $70 typically would have a 30% margin built in for the middleman in there.
3619683	3624830	So you have your distributors, you have your retailers, and you have all that stuff at retail.
3624850	3626152	So everybody makes a little cut of that.
3626673	3655723	when you remove all those middlemen they're making even more profit on top of that so don't give me this oh we're poor we can't make anything off of our game so we have to keep raising the price you're making way more margin up front you're making margin on the back end and it's just it's ridiculous all around so I just I don't see the point of them pushing all this stuff and then then then what they do on top of that by the way is that they they add in two bonus cosmetic skins that cost them next to nothing to make that only come when you buy it on their store
3656463	3680175	or they charge you for cosmetic skins that are really just like recolors of stuff here's the thing we we live in a digital marketplace right now where you know before you'd have to pre-order your game because there was a finite number of copies coming out for physical but if you're buying digital there is absolutely no reason to pre-order games anymore and you probably shouldn't because you don't know what state those games are going to come out in and just because some you know
3680475	3680755	All right.
3704124	3705084	Well, let's move on.
3705164	3711107	Sorry, but I had to bring that because when I, yeah, all that other stuff, I was like, oh, I wonder about that $100 Grand Theft Auto.
3711567	3712968	Surely Loki has an opinion on that.
3713488	3713748	All right.
3714269	3715989	I'm not buying it for $100.
3716109	3716750	No, they're not.
3716850	3719671	By the way, and I'm saying they're not confirming that's the price.
3719871	3723433	It was more of a think piece on the industry would love to see this.
3723473	3723633	Yeah.
3724033	3726614	Hypothetically, the base game comes out at $99.99.
3726674	3728475	No, I'm good.
3729035	3735137	I guarantee it'll be a $70 game and then they're just going to nickel and dime you to death like they always do.
3735757	3736957	That's what'll happen.
3737698	3737938	All right.
3738318	3739998	Well, let's talk about this.
3740779	3741479	Oh, boy.
3741519	3747561	You knew this story was going to come up at some point because obviously there's been a lot going on in the world politically.
3747721	3749762	We know tomorrow is going to be an interesting day.
3750842	3752863	And I would just, you know, all I'm going to say is this.
3754110	3756232	Tomorrow, I'm going to be focusing on Martin Luther King Jr.
3756252	3756352	Day.
3775188	3775768	There you go.
3776388	3781270	Find something else to do, whether that's going outside.
3781310	3781790	And I'm working.
3781850	3783011	Getting together with friends.
3783131	3783611	Working.
3783771	3784151	Great.
3784311	3787292	At least you're not part of, you know, in the spirit of Martin Luther King.
3787312	3788233	Getting double and a half pay?
3788333	3788793	Hell yeah.
3789393	3791234	In the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr.
3791274	3796516	Day, volunteerism is very much encouraged, especially in the Los Angeles area.
3796536	3799257	There's a big need for a lot of that right now with everything going on.
3799897	3800278	and so on.
3800358	3804083	I also realize much of the country, we live in a part of the country where you kind of can go outside right now.
3804343	3810150	I know much of the country is kind of fucking frozen, but you know, a lot of people are... Air quality is kind of shit up here too.
3810190	3810771	That's true, that's true.
3810811	3815036	But anyway, you know, if you can, just make a plan for something to just...
3815777	3825424	Relax, or work or whatever is going to take your mind off it because there's just a lot of negative stuff that's going to continue to be negative.
3826144	3827065	That's all.
3827125	3836931	Anyway, but I'm sure unless you've been living under a rock, you know that the TikTok ban actually happened yesterday for about 14 hours.
3838772	3841473	Which, by the way, I just want to correct one thing.
3842233	3843814	Everybody's calling it a TikTok ban.
3844474	3847135	It actually, the app was never banned.
3848075	3850396	The distribution of the app was banned.
3850896	3854818	The servicing of the app from providers within the U.S.
3854958	3855478	was banned.
3855838	3864301	But it was never written into it that like, oh, if you use TikTok after it's pulled, you as a consumer are going to be, or this app is, none of that was there.
3864381	3866362	This was trying to cut it off at the source.
3867519	3879583	Which is why it was interesting that things went the way they did because they actually shut TikTok off before the app stores did anything at midnight, which was when they kind of, you know, all said they were good.
3879623	3887965	So it's just, and there's a lot of talk, conspiracy theories, and in my opinion, just a bunch of fucking smoke and mirrors until we have some actual answers.
3888045	3894567	That's the problem with those types of apps is that everybody's free to, well, I think Meta bought them because this and this and this.
3894667	3896548	Well, that's great that that's what you think.
3897028	3898089	But that doesn't make it fact.
3898649	3900331	You can get up there and rant as long as you want.
3900351	3901132	It doesn't make it fact.
3902032	3904294	So we just have to kind of wait and see those types of things.
3904715	3910740	But TikTok did go down for a few hours, but TikTok took some things with it.
3910780	3923411	It was pretty much everything related to ByteDance, which was Lemonade, which was their other more Instagram, Pinterest-y app, which is interesting because that was the app they were pushing as a TikTok replacement.
3923871	3925771	So that felt very strange to me.
3954017	3958000	is involved or was involved with Marvel Snap, but only very lightly.
3958100	3960361	They were the publisher of the game.
3960782	3963143	My understanding is they are no longer the publisher of the game.
3963884	3982676	The development of this game was actually developed by Second Dinner and it was published under Nuverse, which is a ByteDance subsidiary, that this app also disappeared because the game was temporarily unavailable because I'm going to assume ByteDance was still being credited as a publisher and anything that had that company's name on it had to go.
3984978	3987459	Xiao Hong Shu is still available from my understanding though.
3988180	3990682	So it's that whole thing.
3990702	3991362	The red note?
3991382	3992203	Yeah, it's red note.
3992803	3994244	I just signed up for that.
3994644	3998147	I don't want to get too far into it, but I'm taking it very well.
3998627	4000248	I understand the memeness.
4000388	4002330	I understand the lulls in...
4004419	4006260	The fuck I'm going to go back to Zuckerberg's app.
4006460	4007661	The fuck I'm going to go to Musk's app.
4007841	4010822	I don't trust them with my data at all.
4011202	4012923	I'll just go give my data to China.
4013043	4020165	And that's kind of what the whole Xiaohangshu exodus or whatever people joining that app is built on.
4020606	4023187	I will say I think it is kind of adorable in a way.
4023647	4028769	The folks in China who have been firewalled for a very long time and folks in the U.S.
4028929	4032030	that are actually like it feels like that whole thing when you have a pen pal when you're a kid.
4032370	4033771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4060089	4061450	You let me know how the water is.
4061890	4063872	You all confirm there's no piranhas in there.
4064572	4070476	And then I'll make an educated decision in a few weeks when we see some of these other cards.
4070917	4074899	I want to keep saying House of Cards, but everything I've heard about Washington, D.C.
4075320	4077981	is that it is nothing like the television show House of Cards.
4078282	4085487	And it is everything like the television show Veep with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, if you've ever seen that show, which I would believe.
4086958	4103262	So, my whole thing that I, I mean, and I just checked it, checked it out, you know, just once, is that the people on there have been really nice and welcoming, but a few people are taking the time to say, you know, our community works different this way.
4103342	4113304	Here is our cultural, you know, how we treat this app and how, what we would expect you to do because you're coming into our home.
4113524	4113704	Mm-hmm.
4115405	4122433	which I think has been a really cool statement that some of the bilingual people have made.
4123294	4125937	So I've really just been looking through it.
4127058	4129661	I was like, after five minutes, I was like, okay, I'm done with this.
4129701	4130242	Thank you.
4131043	4134086	But I mean, it was interesting.
4134724	4144627	Yeah, and again, yeah, I wouldn't expect to go onto an app like that and go, okay, here's my video on all the grievances I have with the Chinese government, blah, blah, blah.
4144667	4145647	I wouldn't do that.
4146087	4151809	But again, if LGBT content is censored, I can't talk about my actual life.
4152129	4155049	I'm not going to censor who I am, that whole type of thing.
4155330	4157610	But I just need a little more clarity on that.
4157670	4158010	That's all.
4158050	4158971	I just need to – how far is –
4160791	4161772	Xiaohang Xu.
4162252	4163493	Because it's not the same company.
4163633	4167576	It is not the owners of TikTok and all that that are behind this.
4167996	4174121	So it's like, how far are they going to go to really try to curate that app to an international audience with this whole thing going on?
4174181	4174701	So we'll see.
4174741	4175122	We'll see.
4175502	4175862	We'll see.
4175922	4178324	But again, you all have fun in the pool.
4178484	4180005	I understand why you're doing it.
4180365	4181987	The lulz is lulzing.
4182347	4182847	I get it.
4183188	4187531	The cultural exchange is cute, but I don't need to be there yet.
4187711	4188932	Y'all get it warmed up.
4190632	4190892	All right.
4191453	4191693	Anyway.
4195415	4198858	Yeah, so anyway, that was all about Marvel Snap ultimately going dark.
4199078	4202620	I don't believe it's back up yet for whatever reason.
4202640	4202980	No, it's not.
4203040	4203401	I checked.
4203781	4204461	Interesting.
4205342	4207103	And I'm assuming they're going to have to fix it.
4207123	4210445	You know, ByteDance isn't actually involved with the game anymore.
4210886	4212367	So it reminds me of...
4212947	4213928	It's that, but for Marvel Snap.
4233288	4243166	They're basically going to have to scrub ByteDance off of everything in there and reassure everybody that it's all data in the States and all this stuff.
4244168	4244428	Anyway.
4247090	4248831	I'm enjoying TikTok for the time being.
4248891	4249432	It's so funny.
4249512	4251274	I used to never understand TikTok.
4251334	4253936	And then probably in the last year and a half, I've been really getting into it.
4253996	4255057	And it's really fun and cute.
4255097	4255898	I don't create a lot.
4256278	4257419	I made a video today, though.
4257439	4258500	I don't make a lot of content.
4258780	4263224	I was like, how do I follow up my banger from November that went viral?
4263765	4264825	It's too much pressure, right?
4264845	4267988	And I finally thought of something this morning where I was like, well, this is kind of funny.
4268048	4269229	It made me laugh.
4269249	4270190	So I was like, all right, I'll post it.
4271832	4272092	But...
4273753	4277274	I, you know, there's a lot of rumors and things and all this stuff.
4277334	4279255	I'm going to wait and just see what happens.
4279455	4292178	I did not love the pop-up message either, but unfortunately, I truly believe we are in for the next four years of this, is that there are going to be a lot of corporations that have their
4292998	4298922	Lips firmly on the ass of the incoming president because unfortunately they know that's how you get ahead.
4299322	4303365	That's how you don't get these reactionary things because that's how this guy governs.
4304125	4308648	We should not live in a country where anybody is able to hold the country hostage in that way.
4309669	4312531	But unfortunately, elections have consequences.
4314592	4319355	So y'all that voted for it, I hope you enjoy the next.
4320196	4321557	I hope you get everything you voted for.
4324500	4332169	Honestly, though, for the rest of us who didn't, I plan on fighting.
4332890	4334211	No, and you should.
4334552	4340338	I'm not saying the rest of us have to roll over, but I'm just saying I think some people are going to be in for a big surprise.
4340378	4341599	I hope they get bit by their decision.
4342260	4342981	Big surprise.
4343201	4343642	How about that?
4344827	4344947	Yeah.
4344967	4345527	Yeah.
4345547	4345627	Yeah.
4363393	4369036	Well, and then the whole frustration around this, of course, for me, and again, I'm trying not to get too political, but it's the world we live in.
4369076	4370536	And yes, it affects games.
4370897	4375839	Case in point, this whole Marvel Snap thing, that is a political story.
4376099	4378000	That game came down for political reasons.
4378760	4380221	So yes, this affects games.
4381602	4383963	And it's one of those things where...
4385287	4386909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4403388	4405229	Joe Biden.
4405349	4406450	It does rest on Biden.
4406530	4409732	And I can say Biden is a fine politician.
4410012	4411594	He's done a lot of great things for this country.
4411954	4422801	He made a colossally terrible decision in ever deciding to run for re-election and not reading the room that most people are sick of the octogenarian grip on this country.
4423802	4428665	Or not reading his own mental capacity, honestly enough.
4429909	4454297	but there's a lot of blame with the people who didn't show up at all and I understand, oh, they weren't enthused about it but that's where I look at it and I go when these next four years play out you're going to feel really sorry about that decision and I hope you can be okay with that that's all I have to say
4456778	4459120	Anyway, moving on.
4459140	4460262	I just can't with people.
4460482	4463024	Yeah, anyway, so how about Evo?
4463205	4464886	Yeah, give me something to look forward to.
4466308	4472394	Okay, we had some audio issues live, so we're sorry about any choppiness you might have heard in those last few minutes.
4472734	4476358	We believe we have fixed that, and we're going to pick back up with our next story, DarkSakura.
4478422	4478662	EVO 2025 EVO 2025
4493592	4500616	Official lineup is Fatal Fury, City of the Wolves, which is its first appearance at EVO and the one I'm actually interested in.
4501636	4514223	Granblue Fantasy vs. Rising, Guilty Gear Strive, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, New Age of Heroes, Mortal Kombat 1, Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, Under Night in Birth 2, Cicely's.
4514703	4520046	And then the extended lineup is BlazBlue Central Fiction, Killer Instinct,
4520666	4529488	The King of Fighters 15, Rivals of Aether 2, Virtua Fighter 5 Revo, question mark, and more question marks, and even more than that.
4529848	4531049	Oh, I love question mark.
4531109	4532209	It's my favorite fighting game.
4533889	4536010	I want to just make a game that's just called, huh?
4536830	4537190	What?
4537430	4539190	And it's question marks, but it's pronounced, huh?
4540411	4541771	Like that, completely like that.
4541811	4542631	That would be a great game.
4542671	4545252	Who would play my game, huh?
4546172	4547292	But I got it.
4547593	4549153	New, new OLR dream game.
4549173	4549513	Uh-oh.
4551499	4551860	What's that?
4551940	4552281	Anyway.
4553303	4555067	Oh, question mark is the new OLR Dream Game.
4555748	4555989	Yeah.
4556290	4556570	Huh?
4557131	4557652	It's a new game.
4558174	4558975	Huh?
4559015	4559817	That's how it's pronounced.
4561160	4561581	Anyway.
4561601	4561721	What?
4563138	4568560	If you are going to put how to say the name in parentheses, you just have to use phonetic marking for it.
4569060	4571601	That's my rule.
4571781	4575142	Maybe when I do my Unity course, I might just name my game that.
4575242	4575582	Who knows?
4577403	4582964	It'll start Midna shooting at poop and toys and things.
4583004	4589767	The game that came to my mind just then when I was like... I think the full name I gave it... This is my dream game, not DarkSakura's.
4590367	4590747	I was going...
4592335	4593036	What?
4593616	4594077	Shoot.
4594257	4595418	Like that was it, right?
4595458	4599641	So I picture a shooter game, but the challenge is you're high.
4601343	4602804	And that's the shooter game.
4603204	4604505	So that's it.
4605766	4608309	I picture playing World of Warcraft with the drunk filter.
4608629	4612632	That's kind of what I picture the huh, what, shoot game would be.
4613133	4615154	Like point blank, but you're high.
4615535	4615735	What?
4616246	4624093	Do you remember my super drunk birthday party at Dave & Buster's where I made it to level 20-something on Luminous?
4624613	4625794	I actually legit do.
4626014	4627255	That was a hilarious party.
4628837	4642368	And before I knew you, when I still lived in Alabama, I beat Raiden... Was it Raiden 3 or Raiden DX on PlayStation, drunk as shit on Everclear.
4643008	4643289	So...
4644827	4650088	That wouldn't necessarily work well for me, given that I seem to play better when I'm intoxicated.
4651048	4651709	Love that.
4652609	4657830	Anyway, but yeah, I think EVA's going to be great.
4657890	4665812	It's going to be August 1st to 3rd at the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hill in, guess, Las Vegas!
4667034	4669595	My least favorite convention center in the world.
4669755	4670395	In Las Vegas.
4670655	4671875	Yay.
4671895	4676596	That place was a pain in the ass to walk around and find anything in.
4678257	4679077	And then it was hot.
4680417	4681217	I do hope EVO's fun though.
4681237	4682058	Even in October.
4683818	4687059	I do hope EVO's fun and I hope Jamie Lee Curtis is there in secret.
4687759	4688419	As she tends to be.
4689759	4689959	Yes.
4690660	4693300	Just remember, any cosplayer you see could be Jamie Lee Curtis.
4694721	4695181	That's true.
4695621	4696021	I've met her.
4696081	4696421	She's nice.
4698525	4722166	um but uh but yeah Evo no uh of course no Smash because of Nintendo and their reasons just reasons all right well maybe maybe there'll be a Switch 2 Smash in the future but at the same time let Sakurai take a vacation like a long one a long vacation yeah yeah all right let's move on Loki
4723775	4733626	Alright, well Genshin Impact has been ordered by the FTC to stop selling microtransactions to children.
4734187	4738772	So apparently they have agreed to
4740501	4746104	Basically block players under 16 years old from making in-game purchases without parental consent.
4747045	4752268	And this is in order to settle a complaint that was received by the Federal Trade Commission.
4752928	4755469	They've also agreed to pay a $20 million penalty.
4756390	4763974	And it says Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning.
4765295	4765435	Um...
4766621	4775987	Under the order, they want to prohibit Genshin Impact from selling loot blocks and virtual currency unless it also provides an option to purchase them directly with real money.
4778989	4781851	Why isn't EA being targeted with this as well?
4782792	4785454	Maybe they have parental controls.
4787455	4795300	Yeah, but they have, I think they have parental controls, but, like, I think it's, you know, they have an E-rated game that essentially they're selling loot boxes to.
4795420	4796521	Like, why is this any different?
4797429	4824681	I don't know, but yeah, it says Genshin Impact uses a gacha system instead of traditional loot box mechanics, whereas players can pull on banners to win random items or characters and the odds of winning are rare it says allegedly it sees players about the odds of winning and it's rare for loot boxes prizes to it says using a confusing virtual currency system so it is confusing
4827148	4829249	You've got like four different currencies in that game.
4829949	4835192	I'm pretty sure that EA, FC, and Madden have the same amount of currencies.
4835332	4837193	SSJ100Matt makes a very good point.
4837293	4841035	EA has better lobbyists, meaning like governmental lobbyists.
4841115	4843356	Yeah, that's the sad truth.
4843396	4844917	Like that comment is on point.
4846198	4846998	Yeah.
4848399	4848779	All right.
4851640	4852601	Anything else to say on that?
4854025	4854845	Nope, that's it.
4855545	4855925	Okay.
4856305	4873549	I'm disappointed that they, like, yes, it's good that they are looking to stop the predatory practices, but it should be applied to all of the companies because I feel that there's a lot more that have been exploiting children for a lot longer, and I think they should target them.
4873589	4875029	But yeah, unfortunately, money talks.
4875449	4878070	Alright.
4878170	4883231	Yeah, maybe pay your lobbyists a bit more than what I would
4883680	4884140	Thank you for watching.
4885201	4886001	I'll see you next time.
4907469	4909210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4926835	4935785	So this is to prevent what could happen in real life where somebody is trading a very rare card for a not so rare card where the other person doesn't know and all of that stuff.
4935825	4937507	You can only trade cards the same rarity.
4937848	4944575	There are eight rarity levels in this game, but the cards from the three highest tiers, they cannot be traded.
4945256	4974560	for now and of course those are the ones that most people who play this video game really want to get I actually think everything I need I would assume all the EXs are in this category and like everything I need to finish my decks are these EX cards like Aerodactyl EX I know is a card I'm missing so I don't know if I can trade for that I think it's in too high of one of the levels for that so everything else I bought with like the Stardust and that stuff so yeah it's kind of takes away the usefulness for some people
4975780	4979822	Also, items will have to be consumed in order to trade, but they don't say what it is.
4980263	4984785	Could it be the hourglass currency that already exists in the game for wonder trades?
4984825	4986506	Are they going to come up with a new currency?
4986666	4987466	Highly likely.
4988627	4989067	We'll see.
4989547	4990688	Could it be Stardust?
4991148	4992709	I think that's what they call it in the game anyway.
4993369	4998192	Because you don't really use Stardust for anything except putting cosmetics on cards right now, which I don't think a lot of people use.
4998772	4999753	So we'll see.
5002089	5004610	Also, there are more packs, I believe, coming out soon.
5004630	5006991	I think there is a new expansion level coming soon.
5007031	5008932	I think they've promised this month or next month.
5009732	5014895	So that'll be pretty exciting because that always makes the game more interesting and gives you more stuff to open.
5014955	5016776	And we'll probably give you things to trade.
5017156	5022939	I think maybe the reason why a lot of people aren't feeling this right now is because they're like, well, I have all the stuff.
5023359	5024820	I don't need to trade for anything.
5025160	5054380	but if they release new packs alongside of it then there's going to be stuff you can actively trade for which I think will make a little more sense at least but that's yeah I do enjoy the game I think it's cute I don't give it any money but it's a cute little time waster that's all and I go I try to upvote everybody's cosmetics once a day so you get your shop ticket because I love it when people do that for me I go in once a day and upvote everybody when I remember I don't do it every day because I don't always remember but when I'm sitting there you know
5055421	5056222	Play in mobile games.
5056922	5057243	All right.
5057663	5063828	Well, let's travel back to a simpler time when you couldn't do digital trading card games because you had a cartridge and that was it.
5063969	5069874	Although, don't think the pick this week is actually from that era, but let's roll the bumper all the same.
5080618	5087904	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5088384	5090886	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5092387	5097211	Oh boy, this is one of those games where it's, oh, it's that old, huh?
5097751	5099733	All right, DarkSakura, what'd you pick for the classic game of the week?
5101514	5103075	I picked Dark Souls.
5104056	5106378	And I specifically picked it because of Shayla.
5107956	5136358	so uh because Shay's been playing quite a bit of this and I never got into it so I'm uh I'm doing it this is a big Alan series as well by the way Alan loves these games so Dark Souls is a game that came out in 2011 it's an action role play game that's developed by From Software published by Namco Bondi Games and it is a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls which is
5137779	5142401	Considered, I guess, first in the series, I reckon.
5143742	5159029	So the game takes place in a kingdom called Lordran, where you play a cursed undead character who escapes from the undead asylum and tries to learn more about yourself, I guess.
5160129	5164771	There is a Windows port with additional content called the Prepare to Die edition.
5164831	5165511	It came out in August 2012.
5167152	5173275	and it was released for consoles under the subtitle Artorias of the Abyss in October 2012.
5174755	5185840	It has been called one of the greatest games ever made, people say, because of the intricate levels, the flavor text, the combat and the difficulty.
5186480	5206722	the difficulty is very unforgiving um and yeah and it's had some sequels so um it is a third person action role-playing game where you really just need to explore but you really should be cautious because everything will kill you in a hit well not really
5207342	5227251	but they can kill you pretty fast but you also will get different areas to get from one place to another you also have this bonfire that's a checkpoint for your levels and you can rest there and heal yourself and yeah
5227671	5254604	but the thing is it's very combat oriented you have melee ranged defense attacks magical abilities you have all kinds of different weaponry from great swords to clubs to maces and spears and stuff you have bows and arrows and crossbows and you have all kinds of different armor and shielding but you have your magic and uh
5257385	5259246	There's something listing as miracles on there?
5259346	5260988	I want to play a game where I have miracles.
5261628	5267914	But then you can also do some smithing and you have consumable items and magical rings and new equipment and all kinds of stuff.
5268594	5269755	And it's multiplayer.
5271096	5274399	You can summon other players or NPCs to assist you.
5275540	5280665	But apparently you can be subject to invasions by others, so there's that.
5280685	5280865	And then...
5283923	5310953	you are apparently trying to go through that multiplayer mode to restore your humanity and if you die before you reach it then you lose anything that you've acquired in that mode so you have very restricted interaction as far as communication you have gestures and soapstones where you can write phrases to each other
5312893	5314574	Although, I mean, we have Discord, so whatever.
5316995	5326658	But the multiplayer component for the PC version was disabled in February 2022 after a security threat within their matchmaking system was found.
5327778	5340623	October 2022, Namco Bandai confirmed online multiplayer for Prepare to Die had been permanently disabled due to the aging hardware, but that they are working for restoring multiplayer to the remastered version.
5342812	5344773	I'm not going to get into the plot.
5347835	5348355	You're undead.
5349315	5350016	You have to do stuff.
5351956	5363501	There's also the expansion, the Artorias of the Abyss, where you, again, are being undead and you're trying to prevent this land from being consumed by the Abyss.
5364742	5364842	Um...
5366448	5368410	So let's go back to a little bit of the development.
5368530	5377676	It was developed by the creator as Hidetaka Miyazaki, who was the director and producer.
5378497	5384201	Again, it is a spiritual successor to Demon's Souls that was published by Sony.
5386223	5394048	And Bandai Namco was chosen to do Dark Souls where they could do multiple platform distribution.
5396711	5405380	So, some of the things that inspired Dark Souls was actually the manga series Berserk.
5405400	5413789	I don't know if anyone's ever played any of the Berserk games or read the manga or watched any of the anime, but it has that very dark, hellish vibe.
5414930	5440268	you know, feel to it and as far as some of the locations in the game they're actually modeled after real world locations like the Anor Londo is based off of the Milan Cathedral and Chateau de Chambord so there's that there's also different folklore parallels for Greek mythology, Japanese mythology and French existentialism
5442049	5446033	Lots of influence by Nietzsche, so there you go.
5448256	5450298	It's pretty deep.
5450598	5451599	I mean, it can get pretty deep.
5452480	5454562	I've seen people, though, be completely silly with this.
5456183	5458746	The PC version came out August 23, 2012, and there is a mod.
5460968	5464449	that goes past the resolution cap called DS Fix.
5466150	5476332	And it was extended to become an official fan-made patch that allowed for graphical improvements and increasing your frame rate and using texture mods.
5477393	5484815	On December 15, 2014, Games for Windows Live was removed from the Steam version and replaced with Steamworks.
5485635	5495159	and you could transfer your achievements and your save games and then Dark Souls became available on Xbox One via backwards compatibility in April 2016.
5496880	5504042	Dark Souls Remastered had a worldwide release on PS4, Xbox One, and Windows in May 2018 and Switch version October 19, 2018.
5509025	5515868	It was ported by Qlock, a Polish studio, and the Switch version was done by Virtuos, which is out of Singapore.
5516729	5526814	It runs at an 8 of 60 FPS, except for the Switch, and it supports a 4K resolution on PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One, and Windows.
5527374	5534158	They made some changes to online multiplayer, including dedicated servers and increasing the number of players from 4 to 6 with password matchmaking.
5535118	5537519	It was very, very well received.
5539159	5544701	Its PC Metacritic score was 85 out of 100, PS3, 89, Xbox 360, 89.
5546301	5548022	Famitsu gave it a 37 out of 40.
5549042	5550982	So, I mean, that's pretty big.
5552023	5559545	The level design was among its biggest compliments, that and how deep the gameplay and the tone of the game was.
5561246	5579581	but the extreme difficulty itself though IGN is quoted saying there's a difference between punishing and downright unfair but Eurogamer said that the difficulty may not appeal to casual gamers but yeah it's a
5581042	5588205	It had some not-so-great reviews for some of the later releases.
5588285	5598450	So GameSpy said that the original Windows port was shabby, where it was limited to this 30 FPS and poor mouse and keyboard function.
5600431	5604473	So not everyone received it well enough.
5605553	5610296	I'm not going to read some of the other discussions about it because they get downright insulting.
5611797	5617280	But Game Revolution gave it a Game of the Year award for Community Choice Game of the Weird.
5617360	5619582	It won all sorts of awards.
5620322	5625225	And it was voted for the Ultimate Game of All Time at the Golden Joystick Awards in 2021.
5627587	5633794	And so then it created an entire legacy of things now referred to as Souls-like.
5635476	5643344	Other games that were said to be influenced by it were Destiny, Alienation, Lords of the Fallen, The Surge, Salt and Sanctuary, Shovel Knight.
5643945	5668093	Titan Souls, Enter the Gungeon, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, Naio, God of War I mean, but then we also have its own sequels which is, you know, we had Dark Souls 2 and 3 and we've also had its other spiritual successors like Elden Ring and I would even say Sekiro Shadows Die Twice is included in that so there you go, it's Dark Souls
5669258	5669678	Oh, yeah.
5670078	5670679	There it is.
5670759	5674821	That's definitely definitely a classic, a modern classic of sorts.
5674921	5682425	But yeah, this is a game that I know Alan is very proud of the fact that he has platinum this game or whatever the equivalent of a platinum is on Steam.
5682885	5685406	But he is which takes a lot of work to do that.
5685446	5689868	But yeah, it's and I think he did it with Dark Souls 2 as well, but not three.
5690028	5692990	Like there's I think three is like somehow different or something.
5693030	5693530	I don't know.
5693810	5695931	It has cooties or somehow is otherwise different.
5695971	5697432	But yeah, I know.
5697592	5698853	And obviously like like cooties.
5699113	5706202	Like you pointed out there at the end, it kind of has spawned a whole genre of games that are that Souls-like.
5706302	5711609	And whenever you sort of die and you lose everything and the bag is there, I hear like, oh, that game's the Souls-like.
5712190	5713511	So it's just kind of funny.
5713792	5713972	Yeah.
5714983	5722068	I don't know, like some of the ones that they compared it to like Enter the Gungeon and stuff, I'd see that as less of a Souls-like and more of a roguelike game, but I don't know.
5722428	5724329	Yeah, a little bit of both.
5724349	5725590	A little bit of both.
5726010	5726851	I guess, yeah.
5727191	5733575	Well, but there's also like the biggest thing that they're including is that there's like the Bonfire checkpoint.
5734675	5756634	um like respawn points um you know where you go to actually put all your stuff together and uh and you know I guess reconvene yourself um but you know um it it has like some ridiculous death animations you know different ways funny ways that you can die um
5758237	5782348	but some other games that are included in that too is like Bloodborne even Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order was kind of included in that Darksiders 3 I'm just trying to think of other names that were more that were influenced by some of those games too was like Dead Cells and Blasphemous and Black Myth Wukong but yeah
5783365	5789153	Yeah, I just think of, like, when, like, Souls, like, it's usually, like, extremely tough bosses.
5789193	5790615	Extremely fucking difficult, yeah.
5790895	5791736	It's Shay!
5792037	5792357	I don't know.
5792798	5797123	I think they were kind of right with some of it, but, like, yeah, I don't know.
5797644	5798004	Alright.
5798265	5799827	So Shay's a small Shay.
5799847	5800488	Mm-hmm.
5802184	5816734	who I told I was talking about the game says that basically Dark Souls is somewhat challenging but so fun once you learn builds but PvP is scary oh yeah the PvP in that game seems really nasty
5819375	5819695	All right.
5820476	5824458	Well, thank you very much, Dark Souls, your classic game of the week.
5824578	5829820	All right, we just have a little bit more for you here, and then we'll see if any of you have anything to say from calling in or what have you.
5831341	5832922	Let's get to some rapid-fire news.
5833002	5833282	Loki.
5834543	5834923	All right.
5835083	5840065	Well, it's that time, that time to tell you about a new thing that you can play Doom on.
5840626	5842907	I know that you're excited, but now, hey.
5842927	5843287	Refrigerator.
5845264	5849708	No, but your office work might be more exciting now because you can play Doom on a PDF.
5850229	5851189	Oh, what?
5851710	5864160	Someone has built Doom into a PDF and it only works in Chromium browsers, but it essentially renders the game using ASCII art.
5865822	5867123	It looks really good.
5868144	5868324	Yep.
5869874	5894718	and so yeah you can check out they have a whole github page and there's a full description how they achieved all that but pretty crazy to see Doom in a PDF I'm pretty sure there's like nothing that you can play Doom on or can't play Doom on anymore so and if there is they'll find a way to get it on there so don't you worry don't you worry exactly I just remember playing Doom
5895547	5899050	Black and White Doom on Mac Classics when I was in college.
5899570	5908858	Look, after the apocalypse, there will be cockroaches, Cher, and Doom and Linux ports will be the things that are still with us after the apocalypse.
5909959	5910740	Which may be tomorrow.
5911940	5912581	Just kidding.
5912781	5913942	A little dark humor, people.
5914302	5914743	Dark humor.
5916028	5935874	then speaking of apocalypse we have a fortnight a new fortnight thing going on where you can actually get skins for Godzilla and King Kong and also turn into Godzilla apparently it looks like kind of like what they did with some of these other events like the Thanos glove and all that stuff
5936494	5965854	but those will be so they're going to have like cosmetics and stuff it's actually apparently the event's going to run from well already started actually since the 17th through February 21st and you'll have to take down giant sized Godzilla's I don't see any King Kong's though but neat I mean at this point like anything any sort of like IP in Fortnite is not a surprise anymore
5966836	5985875	I'm just not surprised Bob Coffee in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says a Doom PDF is almost as impressive as Doom on a pregnancy test that's right, I forgot about Doom on a pregnancy test that was a few months ago, we had that story that's less, I think, less actually playing Doom on the, I don't think it was running on that that test, I think it was just
5987140	5989042	um, displayed on that test.
5989062	5990743	You know what I mean?
5990763	5991283	Interesting.
5991303	5991564	Alright.
5991584	5992264	But still!
5992524	5993045	But still!
5993285	5994186	That's still crazy.
5994486	5994746	Yes.
5994826	5995607	That's right.
5996147	5997168	It's still an accomplishment.
5997368	5998709	Do not belittle the accomplishment.
5998769	5999029	Alright.
5999590	5999870	Anyway.
6001391	6001891	Moving on.
6002232	6002612	DarkSakura.
6004657	6009782	So, well, a game that... It's a fun little game, too.
6010802	6024494	One I've enjoyed playing, of course, I played an import of it before, is there's a game called Mr. Gimmick, which was its original name, that was out in Japan and Sweden.
6025135	6025455	Yeah.
6026095	6053864	yeah but it's finally going to get a North American NES release on an actual cartridge on January 24th the pre-orders will go live on January 24th there's a standard version for $60 it gets you the game and the cartridge but there's also a $100 collector's edition that gets you a green cartridge a numbered foil slipcover a deluxe foil box soundtrack 12x16 poster a manual and an enamel pin
6054384	6056665	and that's being put out by Limited Run Games.
6057986	6059027	So it's a cute little game.
6059387	6068031	You play as a little yokai who is given to a girl accidentally as a toy and then she gets kidnapped and you go to save your little friend.
6070713	6073874	But it was Mr. Gimmick and we're getting it released as Gimmick.
6074474	6074695	Cool.
6076777	6088447	All right, well, speaking of retro classics, Edea has licensed nine old titles to Shin Uden is the company that's going to license these.
6089188	6091150	Then these will show up on modern platforms.
6091230	6095173	I have to admit, I haven't heard of a lot of these games, but I'm pretty sure I know Final Zone.
6095534	6098796	And that's the game that's coming out first on the Switch on January 17th.
6099657	6105318	and there will be ports on other platforms after that as well, such as PS5, Xbox Series, PC.
6105398	6106158	Y'all know the drill.
6106478	6108219	These are the titles that will be released.
6108739	6110299	Do you know any of these, DarkSakura?
6110339	6124662	These are really obscure ones to me, but we have Dinoland, Exile and Exile Wicked Phenomenon, Final Zone, Gaudi, Barcelona No Case, Griffin, Psycho Dream, Soul Deus and... Psycho Dream.
6124822	6125603	You know Psycho Dream?
6125703	6126403	Okay, that's one of them.
6126563	6127183	I know a few of those.
6128364	6130345	Oh, I have seen this Psycho Dream before.
6130865	6135848	I don't know if you did this as a classic game or what, but I've seen this one before.
6135888	6138870	Yeah, Shinyu Den and Final Zone, actually, both of those.
6139071	6141892	Okay, yeah.
6143333	6144474	Wind of Barcelona.
6144974	6146856	Oh, that's about Gaudi.
6146896	6149878	That's Anthony Gaudi.
6150158	6150298	Hmm.
6153065	6154426	I know of this one.
6155366	6163150	That EZE shop or whatever they call themselves will label all of this shovelware because this is very niche.
6163170	6165812	Yeah, this was a PC-88 and Sharp X68000.
6166032	6168113	Retro titles, yeah.
6168213	6170835	And it has to do with Gaudi's
6175822	6176983	Words, words, words, architecture.
6177924	6178284	That's neat.
6179025	6181707	So, yeah.
6181908	6184750	From what I understand, I think it was more of a text-based game, if I recall correctly.
6185470	6185891	Don't quote me.
6186611	6193517	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some other games coming out that aren't just ports or otherwise.
6193557	6193958	Let's see.
6194358	6195359	Loki, what's coming out in the US?
6196238	6202819	Alright, so we have the Curse of Mount Madre on PC.

6216202	6217642	Oh, I've seen this.
6217902	6218522	I've seen this.
6218782	6222283	It's just, it's exactly what you would think from that title.
6223459	6225640	It's PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.

6308629	6325616	Cuisineer on a Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Eternal Strand on a PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series and I think actually that's it, yeah
6326695	6332037	I think I actually started getting into some of the 20th as well, but everything before Botany Manor.
6333618	6337439	Let's talk about the 23rd in Japan on the Nintendo Switch.
6337559	6340280	Ender Magnolia, Bloom in the Mist is out in Japan as well.
6340340	6342921	Guilty Gear Strive also being released on the Switch this week.
6343862	6347223	Neon White comes out in all the languages in Japan this week.
6348123	6353165	Seifuku Kanojo 2 is out in three different editions, including a regular edition.
6353185	6354046	That's a funny name.
6354066	6354446	Yeah.
6355206	6356246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6375615	6398119	and I'm not sure Sailor Uniform Schoolgirl I'm actually maybe I could show this last picture but I'm actually a little afraid to show some of the other ones because I would not want to get the fine Voice of Geeks Network band off of Twitch television and those boobies are very big yes
6399659	6399879	Yes.
6400560	6404362	At the moment you said the name, I'm like, oh, I bet that's naughty.
6404582	6405622	Her poor back.
6405883	6406183	All right.
6406343	6415608	Anyway, the Sweet Cafe Collection, if you're looking for something hopefully a little more innocent, is coming out in a regular and limited edition also in Japan.
6416969	6418490	And I think that's it for the 23rd.
6419410	6422692	So let me get to the PlayStation 5 titles also on the 23rd.
6422972	6425814	You have some new wireless controller colors out in Japan.
6426414	6427475	Chroma Teal is out.
6428355	6429936	You have a game called Sin Duality.

6435680	6439763	And Ender Magnolia, Bloom in the Mist is also out on the 23rd in Japan.
6440584	6441885	Let's go to Europe, DarkSakura.
6443991	6446133	So, you know, just a few things.
6446513	6452739	Ender Magnolia, Bloom in the Mist for Switch and 1.0 for PC on the 22nd of January.
6453580	6459346	23rd, Tokyo Extreme Race for Early Access for PC on the 23rd as well.
6459446	6464511	Star Wars Episode I, Jedi Power Battles, Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series, blah blah.
6465411	6474058	Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth for PC on the 23rd and then on the 24th, Senduality Echo of Ada.
6475919	6476239	That's it.
6476620	6476960	Alright.
6477800	6478621	Well guess what folks?
6478961	6480282	We're getting towards the end of the show.
6481243	6482064	We sure are.
6482084	6482564	This is it.
6482604	6484165	That was everything we had slated.
6484425	6493932	The Switch 2 has kind of dominated the conversation then all the political things we got into earlier have kind of dominated the tech world as well so you know the gaming news has felt a little bit...
6494853	6495093	What?
6495173	6499735	We had other news, but I don't... I'm just going to briefly mention it so we can acknowledge it.
6499875	6506739	There was drama between an elongated muskrat and the internet because somebody is faking their gaming clout.
6507939	6508620	So, you know.
6509220	6510460	I mean, that's not news.
6512081	6513102	We knew that already.
6513242	6514182	We knew that already.
6514342	6517804	What about a muskrat?
6518584	6521886	The current owner of the social media platform we used to like...
6522916	6538146	has been making some tall tale claims on their Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 performance, of which there have been many professional players, specifically a Path of Exile 2, who very much debunked what he was-
6542897	6550185	Not to mention that he was also in apparently a live stream talking to people while someone else was playing the game.
6550345	6555650	They're like, we can see that you're online right now in this game, but you're also over here doing this thing.
6556391	6558794	No, that's not the thing.
6559675	6560796	Also, he didn't know how to play it.
6561036	6589621	I wrote a bleat about this and I wanted to because somebody had yeah I saw the article that I guess Vice ran the whole expose on how he's cheating and the headline read Elon Musk is being accused of cheating at video games by allegedly using loopholes and hiring users to pay for play for him this was my response I'm gonna read this word of word because I think this is important I'm actually glad you brought this up Loki because especially going into tomorrow and what we can expect over the next four years this is very important
6591445	6596166	He did it because he thinks gamers are fools and easily influenceable.
6597046	6604729	After all, look at some things born of the Twitter echo chambers such as GamerGate that probably made him interested in it in the first place.
6605489	6608229	You just marinate on that and don't you forget it.
6608690	6611010	Elon Musk thinks gamers are gullible.
6612871	6617692	And I will find this nice little spot on the hill to die on because I said that.
6619868	6620909	Let them underestimate us.
6622150	6626433	Well, unfortunately, there's a lot of people that are falling for it, but he's not going to get everybody.
6626493	6628435	Let them underestimate us.
6628675	6629235	Absolutely.
6630696	6631597	We will show them.
6632277	6634139	Just remember.
6636340	6646848	I am a firm believer in making those who underestimate you extra comfortable so they don't see it when you utterly destroy them.
6649642	6652043	DarkSakura said you could hear that mic drop from space.
6652144	6653664	Well, I'm glad the audio is working again.
6655265	6658847	All right.
6658947	6659228	Let's see.
6659268	6664451	On that note, I will pitch our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6664751	6667652	You can join us and talk to us throughout the week.
6668433	6671295	If you do want to call in real quick, we have the green room is open and available.
6671895	6672515	Let me check in with you.
6672535	6672975	We have no email.
6673236	6673896	Okay.
6673956	6677258	Well, if you want to send us an email, participate at orangehondrader.com.
6677618	6678178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6700970	6703332	I'm going to go into and make male rules.
6704173	6704513	Perfect.
6704553	6705193	Oh, I love that.
6705694	6706154	I love that.
6706274	6708937	But I wish that we had a bounce back feature.
6709397	6712780	I wish we do invite them on the show and just trash them.
6713881	6714241	Do it.
6714301	6715102	It's like absolutely.
6715122	6717604	We need to have like a special episode where we mock our enemies.
6718985	6720126	I mean, we do that anyway, but still.
6721665	6723086	Do you know what the fuck this show is?
6723567	6724107	No, I don't.
6725648	6731932	I feel like if this was 20 years ago, if this was the Travis Donovan experience, 100%.
6733293	6731932	100%.
6733313	6735634	But I just feel like... Maybe it's in for a spinoff.
6735994	6738716	Now that I'm older, my time is more valuable.
6740737	6741518	You know what?
6741638	6742918	I have a fuck you of the week.
6743979	6744399	Oh boy.
6744679	6745020	Oh boy.
6745976	6748718	I do want to point out, though, and I think Bobby Blackwolf has a very good point.
6749099	6751841	They still want to come on because they feel like they can change you.
6752201	6753923	They want to debate you and fix you.
6754543	6755504	I can change you.
6755724	6756605	I can change you.
6756805	6758827	I just want to embarrass them.
6761129	6761809	That's all I need.
6761929	6764051	I need a big, strong man to change me.
6767534	6771677	So my FU actually goes toward...
6773955	6774276	Zuck.
6775762	6776986	And the entire meta.
6778352	6778894	Because...
6781151	6805902	um and this also goes a little bit towards I'm an activist but dot dot dot you know um you're either gonna take a stand or you're not end of story so if you stay on those platforms you are gonna be now I'm not saying go delete your name but don't you know log in don't give it attention don't you know don't let someone else try to steal your identity certainly not
6806602	6808583	But we're talking about WhatsApp.
6808683	6809844	We're talking about Facebook.
6809864	6811164	We're talking about Instagram.
6811184	6812365	We're talking about threads.
6813205	6814706	So all of those things.
6815407	6821710	You are supporting a company that is participating in trans erasure.
6823211	6823811	Right then and there.
6826226	6844046	protections have been removed and by continuing to go on these sites you are supporting that there are other nasty things that you are supporting by participating on those websites as well but I'm just saying this right now I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but I want but you know they say if the shoe fits you know
6845765	6846145	Just saying.
6846946	6848666	So that's my F you.
6848887	6853949	There are things for people that feel like they really cannot leave meta everything.
6853989	6861193	Like Messenger and WhatsApp, I think, are the two that are very difficult for some people because of family contact or international contact or whatever.
6861753	6866896	If you really feel you can't leave those platforms, there are some really good guides about things you can do.
6867196	6868417	There are other things you can do to reduce.
6868437	6869057	There are alternatives too.
6869477	6878710	Yeah, and there are things you can do to reduce still meta's influence over like, you know, do you need the apps on your phone is a big one to start with because that's the thing that's always pulling your data down, you know, those sorts of things.
6879091	6880954	Anyway, we actually have somebody here.
6881955	6882356	There's Line.
6882756	6885160	I just got on that PixelFed.
6885320	6885721	Is that it?
6886792	6890294	Yeah, that one's still a little, it's, yeah, it's, it's got to grow.
6890414	6891475	But yeah, hopefully it will.
6891575	6892015	Hopefully it will.
6892676	6893797	We actually have somebody in the green room.
6894297	6895618	And I would love to talk to this person.
6895658	6896819	So yeah, let's bring him on real quick.
6898720	6900061	Hello, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.
6900081	6900421	Who's this?
6902142	6904143	Hi, it's Aaron.
6904384	6905444	Hi, Aaron.
6905464	6905885	How are you?
6905965	6906985	You sound depressed.
6907025	6907586	Are you okay?
6908382	6910243	I'm not depressed, I'm just tired.
6910943	6911923	Oh, I'm sorry.
6912824	6914704	Tired in multiple ways.
6916085	6917005	But there is hope.
6917745	6934151	My co-worker who is in his 60s was bragging about how he and all the people he knows have now joined Red Note and
6935831	6939173	are finding all kinds of fun people to talk with there.
6939973	6940953	If you've heard about that.
6941013	6941994	And I'm like, wait a minute.
6942754	6947836	This guy is downloading random Chinese social media apps now?
6949516	6952638	Well, there's a lot of people that went that direction for sure.
6954378	6955779	It's pretty interesting to me.
6957279	6959260	But yeah, this is all...
6960939	6962240	Social media was a mistake.
6962600	6965241	It sometimes starts to feel that way, doesn't it?
6966502	6969744	But I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about... We should have never left LiveJournal.
6970204	6971005	Seriously!
6971385	6972165	Seriously.
6972966	6975767	Anyway, I'm sure you didn't call in just to talk about Xiaohongshu.
6975787	6977108	I'm sure you have other things on your mind.
6977488	6978228	What's on your mind?
6980149	6981850	Well, yes, I'm tired.
6982411	6986353	I've been staring at this game that I'm creating for a very long time.
6987053	6994655	Did you know that actually this month marks 10 years since I started working on this little game that I was calling multitasking?
6995055	6995476	Mm-hmm.
6995756	6996216	I do.
6996696	7008439	I do know that because I was messing around with games on my Steam Deck and I saw the forums for Super Multitasking and I have a feeling I know what's coming and I'm really excited.
7008599	7009700	So, please.
7009800	7010080	Yeah.
7010780	7039847	well right now I'm mostly using it for tech support there's this dude I think in Japan who grabbed the beta of SuperDuper multitasking and he's having trouble with it and I figured out that it has to do with the encryption library I'm throwing in there but it's weird because it's working for me so yes multitasking could in theory no actually multitasking
7040307	7049016	The original multitasking came out on Xbox Live Indie Games in I believe it was either late 2015 or early 2016.
7049496	7053621	So no, not eligible for Classic Game of the Week just yet.
7056163	7057865	But bungee ferret tossing is.
7058666	7059326	Oh, interesting.
7059427	7059887	Good to know.
7061228	7062530	Find me a long play video.
7064366	7064886	You know what?
7065026	7077170	I would say just wait on it until I finally get my stuff together and release the new version on PC that I worked on several years ago and then didn't finish because I got distracted by other things.
7077491	7078191	That's how it goes.
7079451	7084393	So Super Duper Multitasking is in beta right now if people want to check that out.
7085373	7093336	If you own the game Super Multitasking, if you just put yourself in the beta track, you can go right ahead and play the new one right now.
7094656	7095176	That's awesome.
7096937	7110064	But I'm really trying to stick to February 4th as the final ultimate release date because it needs to be done already.
7111585	7114787	Were you showing it at a show that weekend or something too, if I remember right?
7115587	7116968	MAGFest this weekend.
7117288	7118649	Oh god, MAGFest!
7118769	7119770	Oh, you're showing it at MAG!
7120543	7121324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7131761	7132401	I'm excited.
7133422	7134082	I'm tired, though.
7135202	7137642	I'm looking for it to happen already.
7137762	7138423	Please get a nap.
7138483	7142023	I've got a whole bunch of stuff in my hallway already, clogging it up.
7142423	7149565	But to those out there listening, please go by Aaron's booth, and it'll be very easy to see the game.
7149645	7150265	You'll know it.
7150945	7153786	It looks like WarioWare, but like five of them going on at once.
7155247	7156227	Take a picture.
7156627	7158869	Oh yeah, I'll take pictures.
7158889	7160230	I'll take lots of pictures.
7160250	7163371	People who visit you need to take a picture and show up.
7163492	7165012	I'll take pictures of them.
7165032	7165713	I'll be a creeper.
7166161	7195520	but um if you yeah if you are going to MAG check this game out please because it's so well and I remember the one of the years I did go to MAG was you were showing the game although it wasn't I don't think it was totally out yet it might have been on an Xbox but you didn't you didn't have it totally out yet and you you had like a full booth it seemed like almost the whole time people were always coming by and playing it and like really enjoying it and that's that's the thing when people get their hands on it they realize how addicting it is so I'm I'm really glad you get to put it in front of people at such a show like that that's so good
7196408	7198911	Yeah, I'm going to run it 24 hours again.
7199151	7205758	And actually, I'm going to be showing something else with it.
7208020	7211323	I've been actually asked for this several times over the last few years.
7212104	7213566	And I said, all right, you know what?
7213766	7214106	Fine.
7214787	7216449	It's time to bring back Snake.
7218413	7218933	Oh, okay.
7219014	7223375	So the Snake 360, which was one of your early, early games.
7223395	7224596	That was one of your earliest games, right?
7226297	7227237	A new version for Steam?
7228297	7244024	So barely anyone noticed, but in 2016, I put out a new version called Snake Party, which was kind of like the evolution of the battle mode plus some other random stuff like missions and things like that.
7244524	7244764	So
7246605	7268019	this is going to be called Snake Party Extreme and it's basically just going to be the Snake 360 campaign the Snake Party battle mode and just like all the things all the things and hopefully I'm going to get around to improving the graphics just a little bit Snake Party Extreme sounds like a fun Saturday night to me
7270771	7273132	Yeah, it's going to be super fun.
7273752	7275733	I hope people have a really good time with it.
7278173	7279974	Yeah, I should sleep though.
7280074	7284775	And also, I've been streaming The Legend of Zelda ROM hacks on Saturday nights.
7284975	7286036	I've caught some of that.
7286136	7287636	That's awesome.
7287696	7289937	Your YouTube archives of it is what I've kind of noticed.
7290257	7291277	Oh, cool.
7291757	7293238	I'm super happy you're watching.
7294378	7295599	Because it's crazy.
7295879	7298900	This one dude is just making these crazy ROM hacks where like
7300180	7301401	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7317112	7317472	No!
7318012	7319753	Zelda Souls.
7319853	7321153	I did beat it in one stream.
7321373	7322013	It's not that hard.
7322573	7325154	Zelda Adventures Link, but I guess it's not the same.
7326014	7329475	I've gotten original Zelda down below 40 minutes finally.
7331175	7335556	But the ultimate goal is to beat it in an hour on the dance pad.
7335936	7336656	I'm not close.
7337976	7338756	God, I love that.
7338776	7340797	That's so fun.
7341117	7345298	Well, stop doing the dance pad so much.
7345318	7346458	Have you ever tried Rod Calibur?
7346943	7371478	for the record I was swinging the rod on Soul Calibur back when it first released because I was one of the kooky folks that just had to grab every Dreamcast thing immediately and I was like oh Sega Bass Fishing this is amazing yeah let's I gotta get the rod I have beaten Soul Calibur with the dance pad
7372907	7388752	I think we tried that one time too because of course we had the Dreamcast DDR also and I don't know I think Rod Calibur was a little more satisfying Can you swing the rod at Snake Party Extreme?
7390833	7401676	Oh, you can swing it at it but it won't have any function in game unfortunately But it might be fun at the party It absolutely would You can definitely have your snake party with the rod
7405851	7407139	with a person named Rod.
7407742	7409351	Rod Rodders, yeah, sure, of course.
7411613	7412553	Anyway, no, I am.
7412793	7413793	I'm seriously happy for you.
7413853	7414794	I'm happy for MagFest.
7414834	7418394	I'm happy for people to check out and all the silliness of the name.
7418534	7419154	It is a fun.
7419294	7420315	I had fun with Snake360.
7420875	7425855	You know, it's a throwback to the old Nokia Snake game, but, you know, amped up.
7426156	7429696	Do you still have Kyle Ward's permission for his music?
7429976	7431616	Because he had a banger soundtrack in that.
7432337	7433157	Just email them.
7433797	7434597	Just email them.
7434637	7435617	We've been conversing.
7436497	7436717	Yep.
7436797	7436977	Yep.
7437057	7438018	He's on board with it.
7438698	7439338	Yay.
7439438	7440038	That's great.
7440734	7453080	I also had a dude make the sound effects for Snake360 he's on board with it the same terms as before they were super easy to work with yeah we're gonna rock like it's 2008
7454469	7455109	I love it.
7455330	7456270	I love it.
7456430	7457491	Everything old is new again.
7457531	7461433	And let's be real, with everything going on in the world right now, sometimes I wish I was back in 2008.
7462193	7463674	So, you know, it's good.
7463894	7464194	It's good.
7465775	7468857	Well, okay, so dates to look forward to.
7468997	7470318	You at MAGFest next week.
7470818	7474420	February 4th, you said, for Super Duper Multitasking.
7474500	7476661	Hopefully, fingers and toes crossed, you're just one man.
7477582	7481444	And the free-to-play version, Super Multitasking Go, is releasing on the very same day.
7482116	7482496	Nice.
7482576	7483877	And then what about Snake Party?
7484197	7486078	Or Snake Extreme Snake Party?
7486358	7489260	Hopefully this year, but I can't commit yet.
7489360	7490041	Okay, that's fine.
7491041	7492362	Let YYR rest.
7492702	7496364	YYR and Sakurai are going to go on a vacation together because they work too hard.
7499542	7499882	All right.
7500563	7502244	Well, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up.
7502364	7503524	It's always a delight to hear from you.
7503544	7503865	Awesome.
7503985	7504505	Take care.
7504705	7508167	And yeah, thank you for the show as always.
7509668	7510268	It's always good.
7510468	7515311	I'll be listening to the rest that I didn't catch on the way down to Madcap.
7515431	7520814	Please do because you're going to hear all about another dream game and that's how your name came up earlier in the show.
7520914	7527078	So not that we – Yeah, I only noticed when I popped in and Matt mentioned it in chat and I'm like, uh-oh, what did I miss?
7527529	7531870	I just want to point out, the expectation is not that YYR is dream maker around here.
7532510	7534170	Gaming is for everyone.
7534570	7538091	Everyone has the capability to make an OLR wish come true.
7538431	7542152	This does not rest solely on the shoulders of YYR.
7542172	7543612	I need to figure it out.
7543912	7546433	This is probably what's going to happen when I do my Unity course.
7547013	7550894	Because I want to do the Unity course for practicing UI elements.
7553816	7555718	I'll just be the guy on the internet that complains about it.
7555738	7556359	I'm just kidding.
7557640	7560363	It's for the sake of a prototyping position I want to work.
7561284	7561785	Oh, nice.
7562986	7563767	Congrats on that.
7564868	7565329	Have fun.
7566250	7569173	I want a full report on MagFest when you come back.
7569294	7570315	And get some sleep, goddammit.
7570799	7571600	You will get one.
7571920	7574342	I can't promise anything on the latter, though.
7574482	7574662	All right.
7574682	7575203	Well, good luck.
7575543	7575863	All right.
7576323	7576744	Thank you.
7576764	7577885	Passing a sleep spell.
7577985	7579506	You are getting sleepy.
7579706	7580367	Sleepy.
7580387	7581187	Please be well.
7581267	7582528	Take care of yourselves.
7582548	7582688	Bye.
7582769	7583249	Take care.
7583269	7584490	Bye-bye.
7585734	7588236	Always a delight to hear from YYR here at Orange Launch Radio.
7588796	7590258	Okay, we got to wrap up.
7591118	7592720	The sound issues and all that put us back.
7592780	7594161	So let's wrap it up.
7594201	7596963	Thank you as always for tuning into our show and listening to us.

7603668	7604409	Tell a friend or two.
7604449	7610113	A nice five-star review on a site like Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, whatever it's called now, YouTube.
7610454	7611715	All of that goes a very long way.
7611755	7613196	Thank you so much for all of that.
7613516	7615817	Apple Podcasts.
7615837	7616738	Thank you, Apple Podcasts.
7617238	7619860	With that, let's get final thoughts tonight.
7620920	7621801	DarkSakura, I'll start with you.
7621841	7622541	Your final thoughts tonight.
7623562	7626524	I'm leaping into the abyss, as in playing dead by daylight.
7626784	7627204	Pray for me.
7627904	7628144	All right.
7628425	7628725	Have fun.
7628745	7629045	That's right.
7629085	7633267	You are streaming tonight because tomorrow's a holiday, but not for you.
7633327	7634328	I miss my Sunday stream.
7634448	7634668	All right.
7634688	7635309	Well, then go for it.
7635529	7636129	We'll see you in a minute.
7636789	7637310	All right.
7637350	7637710	Later.
7637970	7638150	Bye.
7639491	7640211	Loki, we'll go to you.
7640231	7640832	Your final thought.
7642217	7652502	Final thought is I'm still very busy this week trying to wrap everything up for the rest of this season of builds and my SOP for Minecraft.
7652522	7654102	So hopefully see a video soon.
7655623	7656023	All right.
7656083	7656563	Sounds good.
7657304	7660445	And let's see my final thought.
7662092	7662953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7684827	7687110	Please use your critical thinking skills over the next four years.
7687170	7689172	It's going to be very, very, very, very important.
7689913	7690774	Have a good night, everybody.
7690814	7693957	We'll see you in seven days here on another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
