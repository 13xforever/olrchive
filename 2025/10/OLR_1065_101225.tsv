9717	18166	A new Battlefield is out, and like every game, but especially AAA titles, crashes, long queues, and all the woes of critical mass combine to make the experience unpleasant, to put it mildly.
18346	28837	With developer Dice Studios' name on the screen and back in the news, I would like to extend sympathy to my former colleague, Dice Ori, for once again having to deal with the influx of tweets he's getting with people shaming him for problems he has absolutely nothing to do with.
28857	30999	This is the intro that's mostly about me and Dice.
31019	35644	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story in the rest of the week's gaming news.
35804	38847	Starting right now on the show, we're every gamer and voice.
39282	41785	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41845	46211	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46291	56745	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live tonight, October the 12th of 2025, with episode number 1065 of our show.
56765	66898	My name is Rob Roberts, and thanks to our voiceover guy, Jason, at the top of the show, issuing out condolences on behalf of the show for social media interactions.
66958	67438	No, I love it.
67458	67939	I love it.
67919	75127	But joining us here live for our program tonight, all of you on Twitch as we are recording live.
75167	79992	And of course, my co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
80012	80532	Hi.
80552	80933	Hello.
80993	81433	How are you?
82474	82835	I'm all right.
83435	84757	TwitchCon's next week.
84777	86118	That's got to be exciting.
87139	89502	No, TwitchCon is this week.
89522	91063	This, well, okay, fine.
91084	93826	Depending on, yeah, I guess if your calendar starts on Sunday, it's this week.
94087	96289	Well, is it exciting or not?
97163	101047	I have too much to get done before then to be excited.
101228	104932	I will process that emotion when the time comes.
104972	111619	Now, I thought I had it in my head that I would go to the pharmacy today, not realizing the pharmacy was closed.
111639	116284	And so I drove out there, but I did find that I've gone down a jean size.
116305	116945	So that's good.
117206	119428	Oh, hey, that works.
120069	122091	What are you looking forward to the most at TwitchCon?
122746	124449	Dragshow.
125010	129197	Also, I'm going to do some of the painting stuff, like the Bob Ross stuff.
129217	131081	Oh, cool.
131762	142601	And some other tools to grow my channel and keep going apace, I reckon.
143122	144404	And then Disneyland.
144424	145446	I'm going to Disneyland.
146084	148306	I'm a little sad I'm not going this weekend.
148627	152451	I think it would have been a lot of fun, but there's just a lot of other stuff going on.
152551	156736	So probably my biggest show of the year happens to be this weekend on my other stuff.
156836	157857	But I'm still a little bummed.
157877	163103	It would have been great to see people, and I'm sure their drag show is going to kick ass, but they should be streaming that online, right?
163724	164785	They usually do.
164805	166307	I'd be surprised if they didn't.
166727	168109	But I'm not doing the stupid party.
169470	171973	What even is the after party this year?
173219	200070	some stupid party it's the same as last year the TwitchCon party I'm planning on going to a gathering of streamers since I get more information about it and I think I might go to one of the drag shows like the one that dragged Trashly like over in Hillcrest or wherever they're doing it well have fun, have a lot of fun also say hello to TechMasterLoki
200692	201393	I wish I was going.
201533	202094	I'm not going.
202314	202735	I know.
202835	204377	It's kind of a bummer to not be going.
204417	205358	I already went to San Diego.
205959	206619	Oh, yeah, that's right.
206639	208362	You went to San Diego on a personal trip earlier this year.
209503	220637	I see playing behind you on Twitch because, of course, we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.
220977	225743	And just to address the elephant in the room, yes, we did announce on last week's show there are six episodes left.
226364	228066	Episode number 1070 will
228046	243068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
243048	250039	So yeah, we hope you guys will join us here live for these last run of episodes.
250060	252684	And I didn't talk a lot about last week.
252704	253986	Sorry, Loki, but I should bring this up.
254427	268650	I didn't talk a lot about it last week, but one factor that also kind of played into this decision was some things of a technical nature behind the scenes, namely that the website and web host that has been so graciously donated to us,
268630	273535	Pretty much since the beginning of this thing is being scaled back pretty significantly.
273976	280703	And there was going to be a lot of work involved to kind of change it over and keep it going and so forth.
280783	286369	And so that was another one of those reasons on the table that was like, maybe this is just a sign that it's time.
286830	296140	However, thanks to the hard work of Jason, who has helped us out with so many of these things for so long, there will still be...
296120	298567	Like an archive type of presence.
298587	302519	Not to be confused with the OL Archive like Dark Tetsuya and some of the fans put together.
302559	303321	It's not that.
303341	304785	It's not going to have every episode in it.
305206	307513	But it will still allow you to access...
307898	310101	A variety of episodes.
310121	313285	I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver, but a variety of episodes from the archive.
313905	318211	And, you know, the OL archive that Dark Tooth Studio put together will still be out there.
318471	319873	Many of these episodes are on YouTube.
319893	324698	There will still be ways, if you want to kind of experience the show's legacy, to be able to do that.
324719	333349	And if we decide to do the occasional reunion for a special occasion type of thing...
333329	335293	There will need to be a place to put that.
335413	340463	So Jason, again, will be helping us with all those things behind the scenes.
340483	346094	So but more to come on all of that as we figure that out over the coming weeks.
346255	350864	Anyway, sorry, Loki, but you have a game playing behind you.
351285	354952	And this looks like a Tron game that was on the Game Boy Advance.
355052	355573	Yeah.
356043	384430	yes it's Tron 2.0 killer app that came out in 2004 but it is the Game Boy Advance version because I realized that I have almost run out of Tron games in place behind me that I haven't done before but I haven't done this version and it looks different yeah I never played the Game Boy Advance one I didn't even realize it was like a first person kind of game I'm going to be honest it doesn't look very good but maybe when you're in it they did their best that's right
384950	387102	That's what they got, yeah.
387947	389998	So you went and saw the new Tron movie, right?
390232	390733	I did.
391033	392636	I really, I thought it was good.
392956	393437	I liked it.
395180	401850	I'm a Tron fan, obviously, as evidenced by the cabinet behind me when we broadcast live, but I've had some reservations about this.
401870	407759	But all the people I know that have gone to see it have enjoyed it and recommended it to me.
407779	412386	And so I'm kind of now like, all right, I'm going to try to find some time this week to go see it, I guess.
412547	414770	I'll just suck it up as much as I hate that guy.
414790	415311	He's good.
415291	440860	and yeah well that's the thing so like Jared Leto like I know everyone's Leto adverse and that's fine um to to be that way honestly like his character Ares and I don't know this it is a dig at Leto it it literally could have been played by anybody anybody else the only reason that he is in this movie at all is because he's produced the movie and was the one kind of
440840	442674	Pushing to get it made, I guess.
443822	446260	But literally, you could have replaced him with
446560	473783	anybody just literally anybody and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all he added nothing to to that that role you know and everybody's talking highly of the soundtrack as well which that part I never doubted because when I heard it like your Daft Punk broke up they're not getting back together so once you sort of accept that like it's not going to be Daft Punk and they have to find a worthy successor to Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk it's
473763	474724	I think it's good.
475425	476746	Why didn't they get Gary Neumann?
477327	482513	Well, and if you look at it as a thing that it's like, you know, maybe they bring in a different artist.
482593	485216	I don't know if they'll ever make another movie after the box office for this one.
485256	496829	But, you know, if they bring a different, I feel like Nine Inch Nails, like, okay, yeah, that's going to be an artist that can put together some tunes that are, and not like emulate what those before did.
497190	497290	Yeah.
497270	501695	I was also hearing that they did incorporate a couple of the pieces that Wendy Carlos did.
501855	502076	Sure.
502376	504819	Which I think Daft Punk did, too, if I remember right.
504839	508584	So, you know, yeah, you want to smile and nod, but be different.
508604	510726	And that part I never doubted.
510786	514130	Like, the soundtrack was the part I was always the most excited for.
514631	516893	But I also refused to listen to it until I see the movie.
516954	517594	There's the rub.
518115	518215	Yeah.
518195	542785	but I'll see it I'll see it well yeah and the thing with the and I get it like you know I know with the previous soundtrack for Legacy there was a lot of like kind of themes that kept being incorporated into like different tracks but they all sounded very different whereas this soundtrack a lot of it sounds like the same song over and over again um which is not bad but it's just like
544030	566781	I don't know it it was good though in the movie like I had no problems with it in the movie I think the movie had a lot of potential like it feels like it would be better almost as like a TV show like with that's kind of that's what I wish that's what I wish they do with Tron I wish they do a more cheaply produced TV show and when I say cheaply produced you go back to some of the old school type of effects you
566761	569585	that are going to be a lot cheaper to produce in this day and age.
570225	574871	As 200 Matt points out, Tron Uprising, which was the anime, if I remember right, was good.
574911	579497	They could keep the universe going with a good, well-produced animated show.
579577	580698	And I agree.
580738	585885	I'd like to see it maybe take either an animated form or a cheaply produced Disney Plus series.
586405	588448	But...
588428	589712	I think it was good.
590394	591578	Overall, it was alright.
591819	600345	I am disappointed that not really any of the characters from Legacy are back, except for a hint at the end for sequel bait, but...
600815	623110	whatever I mean it's fine like I like the idea of exploring like a different different sections of the world and stuff like that in the universe and everything and even though there were some things it's like okay we've just kind of invented this MacGuffin for this movie but okay I'm sure that this is a thing now but overall I thought it was good I liked it
623967	650430	but I'd say like one of the things I know with folks that are seeing it there might be a little bit of disappointment because if you think about it when you went to see Tron Legacy the difference like basically all of the unexpected things happening because what you expected in the original Tron movie versus like the newer tech and stuff like there's a lot of kind of surprising moments and stuff and seeing where they're taking this whereas um
651220	666748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
666982	671691	There's a little bit of this whole AI stuff where they try to tie it into AI.
672493	675619	It doesn't really work, but I don't know.
675739	676301	I enjoyed it.
676481	677603	I thought it was fine.
677623	681170	I didn't hate... Leto didn't ruin the movie for me.
681190	684096	Because Leto really, like I said, the character...
684785	704127	All right.
704866	708112	Well, let's get into some kickoff news topics tonight.
708532	710816	Talk about what is going on in gaming news.
711578	716066	Starting off with one that's a little more in a rumor state, but I think there's some smoke here.
716106	716667	I really do.
716907	722898	I was trying to do some of my own independent research that I do think something's going on with this.
722938	723819	Loki, do you want to talk about this?
723839	724641	I know I pulled this story.
724661	725723	You want me to talk about this?
725863	725963	Sure.
725943	737199	Sure, so there's rumors that other retailers aside from Costco are going to be pulling Xbox stock, mentioning Target and Walmart.
737319	745671	So I'm going to tell you right now, just based off of what, you know, I used to go to Target like every single week when I take my kids or my son to his programming class.
746092	747734	I've since stopped since like June.
747934	751900	But when we were there, they never really had...
751880	771998	XBOX Hardware
771978	773901	Before they even discussed hardware.
773921	789987	So they were already, as it is, I think outside of maybe the Switch and Switch 2, have stripped most of the physical media from the gaming section because it's just not selling as well.
790102	820108	and so you have on top of that these consoles that yeah it gets people into the store to buy other things but I'm assuming that these consoles are very similar to consoles back when I was selling video games to you know game stores and stuff like that there's no margin on them they're essentially sold at a loss and so it doesn't make sense when you have these prices going up and up and up you know why is like a Target or something like that going to bring in an $800 console and risk
820088	825435	Selling, like not selling that you're sitting on this expensive hardware that, you know, may not sell.
826156	846703	So I get it if that they're, you know, removing and really, they're not necessarily taking it out from they're taking out the physical stores, but they're still probably gonna sell it out of a warehouse or online, you know, maybe that's the other thing is a lot of people are not going into stores to purchase stuff like this, but they're just shopping online, getting it delivered for free to their house.
846683	850789	Well, I think, you know, we got to see some hard figures to really say for sure.
850809	857058	But I can't imagine that now that an Xbox Series X costs like $800 because of tariffs and the price increases.
857098	860603	I cannot imagine these are flying off shelves the way they used to.
860783	861885	I really can't.
861905	868474	And I think it's important to say with this, too, that this is all being sourced from Reddit rumors, which you'll obviously take it with a grain of salt.
868774	870717	But it is multiple people on Reddit.
870697	886782	Target, Target, Target
886762	907636	and their website and you search for, so I'm searching for a pretty big Target store on the south side of town, search for Xbox Series and filter it to the actual game consoles, you see that they have a Series S, they have the two Series S's there, the one that's one terabyte and the other one's 512 gig, but you don't see the Series X anywhere in here.
907656	908758	And then here's the big one.
909178	912043	If you actually filter this, shop in store,
912800	915103	A PlayStation is your first result now.
915123	918166	You don't have any Xboxes that are available in stores.
918186	921891	And even if it's, you know, okay, change the store, do a different one in the area.
921951	924034	Sure, I'll pick another big store in the area.
924094	925535	Okay, that's the one over on 65th.
925916	926797	Nope, that one's empty.
926857	928178	The Midtown one's a small store anyway.
928319	929680	Arden, that's a pretty big store too.
929760	930421	Nope, empty.
931222	935928	You can't get an Xbox console in the store.
935948	939432	So that's where I'm kind of like, all right,
939412	943836	I definitely believe something's up with Microsoft's presence in the store.
944477	952845	Now, Walmart, on the other hand, if you search them, you can still find in store that they actually do have the X listed.
953646	958951	The version with the smaller drive is still there, and you can go pick that up in the store.
958991	965757	So I'm a little less that Walmart has phased it out, at least right now, right this minute, but it does appear Target...
965737	967519	is scaling way back on it.
967539	972086	Well, yeah, I mean, if you think about it, I don't think they have any big holiday games coming.
972586	974589	Their consoles just went up in price.
974609	976772	Their online service is going up in price.
977232	985744	It's not really sounding like a good year to... I mean, if anything, it'd be a good year to purchase a Switch 2 or something like that, because I think that would be a lot hotter.
985764	988568	You've got bigger games coming out for that this holiday.
988608	993955	You've got... I don't know what's necessarily coming out on the Sony camp, but...
995335	1006628	I just think it's maybe not a good year to purchase console hardware, especially when you have, you know, Microsoft kind of flailing about right now with what their strategy is with this and how they're going to go forward.
1007348	1013215	And I just, I don't know, it might be better holding off or just doing something else.
1013575	1017400	Yeah, like, I mean, like, this is a terrible year to buy an Xbox.
1017540	1024988	Everybody knows the price of that has been artificially inflated and it's not Microsoft's fault.
1024968	1033202	It sucks that this whole situation could... I mean, I don't know.
1033222	1037309	Maybe I'm being dramatic, but it could kill Microsoft's hardware business.
1037950	1044341	Now, maybe they come back once this tariff thing finally gets shut down, if it ever does.
1045383	1047567	Because remember, Congress could end this tomorrow.
1047547	1067496	Yeah, they're playing Tic-Tac-Toe instead.
1067476	1069340	No one's balancing our checkbooks.
1069360	1069841	That's right.
1070722	1081984	So anyway, I, you know, maybe Microsoft can enter the hardware game again in a few years when, you know, it's not economic, you know, ridiculous to do it.
1082004	1086733	But I just I really feel like this is the beginning of the end for the Xbox series.
1087237	1103592	Thank you for watching!
1104280	1116559	Wait, are these kids, let's assume that, I mean, I don't know if they're going to be buying PCs or whatever, but imagine getting your kids a PC or something because it's just like, oh man, these console games are too expensive.
1117701	1117801	Yeah.
1117821	1122569	Wait till they find out, oh wait, I can play PlayStation games and Xbox games on this PC?
1123771	1125594	Well, wait, what am I doing?
1125694	1128398	Why am I buying a console then?
1129559	1158047	I don't know I don't know how Microsoft fixes this mess because two weeks ago I would have said if this had been a story two weeks ago I would have said well Microsoft needs to lean into Game Pass hard they need to commit to their every place is an Xbox strategy and they need to run with it and then well they shot that in the foot last week didn't they by upping the price of Game Pass and now everybody wants to get rid of that boy oh boy so I don't know what to tell Microsoft at this point besides you're fucked
1158517	1162470	Not that they would listen.
1162490	1163132	I know, they don't care.
1163593	1171378	But Forza Horizon, hey, I'm still excited for Forza Horizon 6, but I don't think it's going to save Xbox gaming right now.
1172675	1182669	Well, I also worry about stuff like that, too, because you look at what they're doing even just with their operating system stuff and how they're really just not listening to the consumer whatsoever.
1182769	1184551	They're throwing in advertisements everywhere.
1184571	1187355	They're trying to monetize whatever they can from that stuff.
1187856	1195086	I think that's going to carry on through to more things as time goes on.
1195106	1195206	Yeah.
1196587	1202952	All right, well, but that Xbox price hike might not apply to everybody, right, Loki?
1203792	1210620	Well, yes, it's not like what it's, you know, it's not as good of news as you think it would be.
1210640	1215966	But certain regions apparently are not getting the price hike on November 4th.
1216967	1218429	It's only a few countries, though.
1219230	1228821	And so right now it's, you know, places like Poland and Korea will remain in the normal lower monthly price thing at the end.
1228801	1243570	Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, India, and Austria So they're not going to see the price hike But everyone else still will
1245271	1249014	Some comments from chat I want to get to because, of course, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
1249755	1254980	DJ Ranma S says, as long as Microsoft sells gaming software, there will always be an Xbox.
1255000	1258563	It does not make sense for the company to promote its software on another device.
1258583	1262126	The company promoting Game Pass on other hardware is a desperation tactic.
1262507	1264428	But they are promoting on other devices.
1264528	1266030	They're promoting on PlayStation.
1266170	1269673	There was, you know, the big announcement at Tokyo Game Show with Forza Horizon and stuff.
1269693	1272876	So I think that part of your comment is a little misguided.
1272976	1274097	However...
1274077	1283989	I do agree that as Sega still exists, even in the lack of hardware world, making some pretty darn good games, honestly, that are really appreciated.
1284489	1292138	I think Microsoft owns enough game studios, including the Activisions and Blizzards and Bethesda's.
1292379	1293820	God, they have an awful lot, don't they?
1294141	1297705	I do think Microsoft has enough gaming studios that...
1297685	1306097	Microsoft as a game maker can make Windows games, if nothing else, and still have enough of a niche and a space.
1306117	1308660	But I think the Microsoft looks very different.
1308700	1311284	It's going to look very different if there is no Xbox hardware business.
1311724	1315029	And maybe, maybe that's not a bad thing.
1315049	1319355	Maybe having Microsoft having to focus in a
1319335	1320897	maybe ends up being a good thing.
1321017	1322999	I don't want the Xbox to go away.
1323159	1324260	I'm not cheering this.
1324800	1332128	I'm just accepting the reality that because of what the government did, that Microsoft is kind of fucked in multiple directions.
1332228	1338614	At the end of the day, like less competition means, you know, a worse environment for us consumers.
1338634	1348224	So it's, it's, I'd rather see them still succeed because otherwise if they're not around, then Sony is not really pushed to innovate.
1349265	1349325	Uh,
1349305	1367989	and the same would be with like Microsoft even if Microsoft or Sony went away then Microsoft wouldn't be pushed to innovate so you need to have that competition or to drive prices down to you know push innovation and do unique things otherwise they're going to get very complacent
1368577	1398567	S2100 Matt says,
1398547	1400490	It doesn't.
1400791	1424470	It doesn't.
1424450	1429217	That's the reality we may have to accept, at least on the Nintendo and Sony front.
1429577	1435145	But Xbox is going to have it a little harder because Xbox never did get Japan.
1435165	1437509	So they only have the US and Europe.
1437529	1443277	So the US is going to have a lot more on what the future holds for Microsoft.
1443657	1453832	I think what you might see, to give an extremely long answer to your question, I think you may see for the first time, well, not the first time, but...
1453812	1481305	you're going to see Microsoft and Sony release in different years which technically has happened before but I think you're going to feel it like you're going to notice they're not releasing in tandem and that could be very interesting because in that case Microsoft's going to be the one that feels like they're playing catch up because the games developed, especially in Japan they're all going to be with PlayStation in mind they're not going to be any better for Microsoft no matter what the specs are
1481285	1488416	Yeah, you're going to get developers, especially if they're not selling on those consoles, they're just not going to even develop with Xbox in mind.
1488436	1490143	They'll be like, well, I'll put it on PC.
1490304	1491328	That takes care of
1492068	1492949	Most people.
1493049	1494510	And then PlayStation.
1495271	1498614	And I said this on last week's show, and I'll say it again.
1498874	1504219	If you are one of those people that says keep politics out of gaming, it is too late.
1504239	1505159	Too bad.
1505179	1509523	Because what is happening to Microsoft is directly because of political.
1509663	1516489	And you can brain worm your way into whatever, but that's the fact.
1516509	1519212	Why is an Xbox as expensive as it is?
1519232	1520893	Because of the political climate.
1522392	1525516	I'm not going to say you can you can believe it's a good thing or a bad thing.
1525556	1526037	That's fine.
1526057	1526878	That's I'm not going to.
1526898	1534708	But I'm just going to say that this whole retail and now it's not on the shelves can be directly related to what's going on politically.
1534828	1540296	And if you think those prices are going to go down to pre-tariff prices after the tariffs go away.
1540316	1540756	It's not.
1540856	1542198	Oh, they got time.
1542218	1543580	You're sorely mistaken.
1543760	1544141	Oh, yeah.
1544161	1545042	No, no.
1546203	1546603	All right.
1547404	1555972	Well, with that in mind, I think a lot of us are playing the games we already have or going to our backlog, maybe discovering some new things, but we'll find out in our gaming week.
1555992	1557593	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
1558914	1559555	It was painful.
1561517	1562337	Because my hand hurts.
1566621	1566901	Hello?
1567342	1567762	Hi, yeah.
1567842	1568703	I'm sorry to hear it.
1568723	1569323	Okay, sorry.
1570805	1573047	It was just really quiet.
1573087	1574068	But I know you're streaming.
1574388	1574488	Yeah.
1575734	1579099	Well, for short periods of time, I really couldn't go very long.
1579319	1592839	I've heard the, I'm trying to describe it in non-medical terms, but it's the fifth metacarpal distal end on my right hand.
1592959	1598147	So the bone under my pinky finger, the top part of it,
1599241	1603489	I don't know what happened, but my x-ray came back all clear.
1603570	1608980	No arthritis, no inflammation, no dislocation, no broken.
1610463	1617157	But it still hurts quite a bit, especially after I've played for a while or done things for a while or let it hit idle for a while.
1617197	1618920	It just comes and goes, really.
1618900	1643794	and so I've been able to play like maybe an hour of Dead by Daylight at a time and then an hour of something else at a time and I'm fine if I remember to keep my hands up while I play but I'm using compression glove and I still have to get through that Dead by Daylight challenge before I leave so I can get the stuff for it so whatever
1644044	1655224	But yeah, I also played some Nocturne in the Moonlight last night and played some Palia and just the usual.
1657208	1662137	Before we go to Loki, I wanted to give you space to if you wanted to promote the GoFundMe you've been promoting.
1662978	1663499	That's right.
1664139	1678295	So one of my dearest, longest friends ever, Gwen, who we know in chat as either Finara or Loony Bard, is in a pretty dire situation.
1678315	1686724	I mean, she's been suffering for a while after losing her job and losing her folks and
1686704	1688267	All kinds of stuff going on.
1688287	1693477	But now her power has been shut off and they said that she owes like $400.
1694719	1697063	And that's like just to turn it back on.
1697164	1698185	She owes a lot more.
1698947	1703295	And so I've started a GoFundMe and my immediate...
1703275	1712530	My immediate request is to at least get 450 up, which would be able to get her power turned back on.
1712891	1723428	I bought her a solar battery that, of course, with it getting cooler weather in upstate New York, you know, thanks, SSJ100, I was about to post it.
1725351	1726633	It's...
1727373	1749482	It's gonna get colder and she's got three cats and, you know, I just don't want her to be going into colder weather without any means of being able to, you know, cook food or stay warm or charge her phone and stay in contact with people because she's there by herself.
1749462	1755075	and I mean I hope she doesn't mind me going a little bit into the situation.
1755275	1758924	I'm definitely not going into all of the situation but it's pretty dire.
1761409	1766020	We've only raised $75 out of $450 and that's
1767080	1793026	Yeah, I'm waiting on a payment for my hosting this weekend, but I'll chip in a little percentage of that.
1793086	1794167	So, yeah.
1794147	1795029	I appreciate it.
1795149	1795810	I appreciate it.
1796451	1807192	If we can just get that amount to get her power turned back on, that right there would be amazing.
1807934	1816290	And hopefully, I mean, in the meantime, I think the solar battery might just be enough to keep her phone charged.
1816270	1825321	But people, especially with the way things are and how hard it is for people to get jobs, and she doesn't have any transportation either.
1825341	1826843	It's a really dire situation.
1828525	1840459	And even if I knew someone who would be able just to go up and help her out with things around the house or anything, I would be really grateful.
1840619	1843763	But for the time being, this is what we can do.
1845886	1846547	Alright, thank you.
1848011	1848532	Let's go.
1848552	1853823	Oh, and when you do it, just give a big F you to you know who while you do it.
1853923	1857672	Because this also would be something that that piece of shit would never do.
1858293	1862322	Would never reach out to help somebody.
1862342	1863123	Alright.
1863143	1865108	Well, let's get back to our gaming weeks.
1865128	1866190	Thank you, Renari.
1867553	1895502	Thank you for watching!
1895752	1903347	I've got an event, my current event thing that I'm actually doing on November 2nd, which is also a Sunday.
1904649	1908457	So I'll probably be posting something on Blue Sky for that.
1908557	1915971	I retweeted it on X, but yeah, it's a charity event for...
1917217	1918479	Oh, let's see.
1918779	1920482	It's one of the podcasts.
1921964	1923466	Our friend Orbitz does that.
1924087	1928012	And yeah, it's something that they're starting to partner with this.
1928212	1930095	I think it's Clix or Crix.
1932098	1933981	It's a pretty fun event.
1934001	1936063	So I'm on a team of four.
1936544	1941511	And we'll be doing parkour and PvP and all that fun stuff that I'm not good at.
1942072	1942853	Can't wait.
1946545	1947587	That's basically it.
1947767	1948608	Yeah, have fun with that.
1949710	1950111	Let's see.
1950451	1951873	My gaming week.
1952254	1956200	I've been playing a little bit more of the Final Fantasy Tactics, of course.
1956220	1957963	Always playing too much of my mobile games.
1958043	1959706	I did Pokemon Go Community Day today.
1959746	1963031	I caught like 15 of those... Solosis?
1963171	1964353	I don't even remember the name of the thing.
1964954	1966917	I caught like...
1966897	1969222	14 of them on like a three mile walk.
1969242	1971847	And I'm like, I'm never going to know what to do with these.
1972208	1976276	Oh my God, Matt, if I ever see you again in person, you can have like seven from my cow.
1976377	1978781	I don't need 14 shinies.
1979924	1980625	What, Pokemon Go?
1981527	1983170	Yeah, I don't play Pokemon Go anymore.
1983451	1984934	No, not you, Matt.
1984954	1985555	Sorry, in chat.
1985636	1985876	Sorry.
1986177	1986357	I gotcha.
1987855	1989918	200 Matt said, I got zero shinies.
1990419	1991901	Oh, my wife caught a bunch, so I'm good.
1991921	1992441	Well, that's good.
1993142	1999872	Yeah, I just, I actually found a place not downtown that has, you know how like Pokemon, well, I'll tell you what it is.
2000032	2002816	It's all based on where XM spawns in Ingress.
2002836	2008304	And again, just, you know, having played all the games for a while, XM spawns in Ingress are very similar to how Pokemon spawns.
2008324	2014993	So if you find the places that are dense in XM, which I believe was based on some sort of like cellular estimate.
2014973	2016955	I think it was like cellular traffic.
2017315	2022139	And that's why it's always like clustered in strip malls and on the road and things like that.
2022200	2026103	I think that's why it is set up the way it is because I found a place.
2026163	2026824	It's really funny.
2026884	2032008	It's a walking path right near power lines and it's just full of Pokemon.
2032028	2037173	So I played Community Day there with my Bluetooth just nonstop.
2037293	2038915	I ran out of Pokeballs.
2038995	2040156	I ran out of space.
2040776	2044980	And that's probably why I have a lot.
2044960	2066884	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2066864	2069849	I logged into my PlayStation to play Final Fantasy Tactics.
2070189	2072192	And you know who I saw playing Diablo 4?
2072653	2076439	I saw Grandpa from Horde House playing Diablo 4.
2076479	2078141	And I was like... I actually texted him.
2078161	2080665	I was like, bitch, you played Diablo 4 and you didn't tell me.
2080685	2082047	And he's like, yeah, I'm playing this season.
2082067	2083389	I was like, ah, fuck.
2083690	2085853	Now I gotta start a seasonal character so we can play together.
2085913	2086855	So I did.
2086875	2089058	And I got to...
2089527	2091108	like Torment 1.
2091128	2093230	I'm already max level and I didn't get power level.
2093250	2093831	Thank you very much.
2093971	2098435	Not that it matters, but I worked my little Diablo tail off and did it.
2098455	2104541	So I'm playing a Hydra, not like Hail Hydra, but like Hydra heads.
2104681	2106943	It's a move that sorceresses use.
2106963	2108684	So, and I love my sorceress.
2108724	2109965	She's so hot.
2109985	2111267	I just hit the rant.
2111307	2112848	This is how I make my characters now.
2112868	2115911	I just hit the random button until it's like, ooh, that one's hot.
2116311	2119534	So I got a hot sorceress and yeah.
2119514	2141877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2141857	2162413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2162393	2188536	um look at this mega evolution look at this mega evolution like all the spoilers I don't really care like I'm like it's just what they look like it's not gonna change the way I play the game but it's just like otherwise as far as like the live battle system and stuff I haven't really been ODing on all the information out there so I'm excited to just absorb it so um I might do a stream when it unlocks Wednesday night um maybe
2188516	2192180	So, yeah, MikeDev says, yeah, I don't mind forum spoilers.
2192280	2195043	SJ100Matt says, so did you decide on your starter, Rob?
2195423	2198947	I did, and I'm going to be honest, and I'm going to get hate for this, and I don't care.
2199587	2203612	I'm not big on any of the starters that they picked, to be honest, for this one.
2203632	2208076	But I'm going to go with Tepig, because Piggy.
2208096	2210098	So that's, and that's it.
2210118	2210839	That's it, Piggy.
2210899	2211620	And I like Emboar.
2211680	2212841	Emboar's kind of a cool Pokemon.
2212881	2214743	So I'm going with Tepig.
2216123	2218967	All right, let's get into some more gaming news.
2219127	2220228	We got some for you.
2220249	2222692	So, Loki, let's go with our first story.
2223893	2230462	All right, and, you know, it's a week, so we have Nintendo filing lawsuits.
2230923	2236991	This makes a little bit more sense, though, rather than, you know, filing lawsuits with random people about stuff.
2237011	2243059	This is about the Reddit moderator for Switch Pirates, but that's okay.
2243039	2248665	Not only were they a moderator, they were also a Switch pirate, and they ran multiple pirate websites.
2249025	2260337	It's less about them moderating a forum and them running the actual Switch websites, or piracy websites, which is what they were involved in.
2261278	2268726	Nintendo is demanding $4.5 million in a default ruling because they apparently did not show up.
2269246	2298544	and yeah and apparently uh they also have to obviously uh stop running those websites but yeah i don't know uh it makes sense to me so stomp out that piracy i guess does it feel like don't run it does does it feel like the reddit user oh sorry i was gonna say maybe don't run a a uh piracy ring completely out in the open like this like i would think i don't know um
2299942	2314660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2315365	2320795	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we'll never figure out if piracy is not a gray area unless someone actually fights it in court.
2320935	2322117	I don't expect this guy to do it.
2322137	2327086	You're right, but I don't expect this guy to do it.
2327486	2334198	I feel like this guy's just kind of treating it like the letters from the collector where it's like, I'll just ignore it.
2334319	2334960	What are they going to do?
2335300	2336923	They can't get money out of somebody that doesn't have it.
2337224	2339668	I really feel like that's what this person is responding to.
2341083	2347352	Also, like, how can you prove that all these, like, pirating all these works?
2348073	2364216	See, this is why, okay, so, in one sense, yes, I think it's just, but in the other sense, like, we have, like, open AI just literally pirating all of the things and just be like, we cool, we need to pirate all the things to run our business.
2364797	2364897	Yeah.
2365012	2366514	You like business, right?
2367174	2372540	Like, we can't beat China unless we break all the rules and steal all the things.
2372700	2375482	It's like, that's exactly what some of these countries do.
2375963	2380247	You bring me to a very interesting thought that was my reaction.
2380387	2386614	My honest-to-God reaction when I first read what this guy was doing and why, you know, he's just like, whatever, not even, like, bothering to fight it.
2387254	2391078	And I don't know, maybe I'll get cancelled for this opinion, but I don't give a fuck.
2391098	2392319	We got six episodes left.
2392339	2392860	What are you gonna do?
2393581	2395002	Like...
2394982	2402526	My honest thing is that I think in our current political climate there's no accountability.
2403108	2406679	We have a person at the very, very, very top
2406828	2409892	Who ignores things that come from the courts?
2410513	2412615	Because there's no accountability, what's going to happen?
2412635	2414077	Who's going to hold this guy accountable?
2414197	2414638	Nobody.
2415419	2421787	So I think this guy probably gets emboldened a little bit like that.
2421907	2425091	There's not going to be accountability.
2425111	2426373	Nintendo's never going to see a dime.
2427094	2428175	This isn't the world we live in.
2428215	2430338	We don't live in an accountable society.
2430537	2432301	Nintendo's never going to see a dime.
2432321	2445711	And I really, you know, again, I don't know this guy, whatever, but I'm just gonna say I would not be surprised to see more of this because that is, again, kind of that political world we live in.
2447395	2456827	I was looking for a chat to QuestBuster says, not just Pirate, but apparently from what I've read elsewhere, the accused was also charging for premium access to certain ROM sites.
2457247	2460531	Always putting that, you know, getting money for it is always a huge no-no.
2461452	2468901	Fifth Dream says the way they got around it is people paid them $5 in eShop cards for access to the downloads, which they supposedly used to buy the games.
2468921	2471104	Technically, it wasn't money.
2471124	2471985	So I...
2473045	2483942	And I think, to your point, Loki, what you were just saying about AI is another excellent example of how there's no accountability.
2483962	2486506	You can go to AI and say, make me Mickey Mouse, make me Shrek.
2486526	2489631	I was training my AI on your content.
2489651	2490853	I guess I'm free to go.
2490973	2491414	Bye.
2491835	2493838	There's nothing that's going to stop.
2494865	2497933	Right now in this world as it is.
2497953	2503908	And I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying how did we get here?
2505111	2505612	This is how.
2508559	2509782	Yeah.
2509802	2510123	Anyway.
2512111	2513533	To be continued.
2513553	2516616	I will be interested to see if Nintendo makes a dime off this.
2516656	2518659	But let's be clear.
2518679	2520962	Like, piracy is wrong.
2521322	2527209	And, like, it's not... Like, the Supreme Court is not going to say, sure, you can have this piracy thing.
2527329	2528551	It's wrong.
2528971	2536280	Just like Hollywood's going to come after people that are selling pirate Blu-rays and DVDs of, like... It's going to happen.
2536300	2539063	But, of course, we all know in other countries...
2539043	2546320	where Hollywood doesn't have as firm of a grip they can't really stop what's being sold on the streets
2546519	2560123	All they can do is just try to make people feel bad about it.
2560624	2569860	They'll just generate the next Tron Ares instead with AI because that's completely legal and they certainly haven't gotten in trouble with anything.
2570077	2571499	No, not at all.
2571519	2576945	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yes, the Supreme Court would say it's wrong, but they haven't said it yet, so it doesn't legally count.
2577205	2580930	You know, again, my gut response to that was going to be, well, it's just a matter of time.
2580970	2581971	They're going to say it's wrong.
2581991	2584153	But now I'm sitting here going, you know what?
2584194	2587618	With this fucking clown car show in Washington right now, I don't know.
2588058	2589420	I don't know what happens.
2589680	2591402	Maybe it'll be a fun gamble.
2591722	2592203	Let's see.
2592343	2594886	Because, again, if the AI companies can get away with it.
2595220	2595841	Why can't I?
2595942	2604741	Maybe we just get a certain head of state addicted to playing pirated Switch 2 games and then it'll be completely legal for everybody, right?
2605443	2611997	Yeah, we just need those pirated games to say good things about the people running the government and it'll all be a free-for-all.
2616348	2622916	Anyway, oh, what a great lead-in to the next story, because we have a story about AI usage.
2622936	2625980	And Rin Mari in chat was like, uh-oh, did I bring up this story?
2626160	2627061	You kind of did.
2627161	2628983	It was posted by DarkTitsuya.
2629003	2629784	Kind of your fault.
2630085	2631847	It's kind of your fault, but I think it's a good one.
2631867	2634670	I wouldn't bring it up if I didn't think, like, wow, this is something we're talking about.
2635311	2638575	And again, a shout-out for the Discord community, which...
2638555	2645508	Which will stay up for the foreseeable future until Discord gets shut down, I guess, or we get kicked off it.
2645889	2650257	VOGnetwork.com slash Discord if you want to continue to share news and talk about the news.
2650918	2656969	And this is where Ranmari shared the story and then DarkTetsuya picked it up and was like, here's a source, you might want to talk about this on the show.
2656949	2660094	And what basically happened was that there was a tweet.
2660134	2661617	I believe it was also a Blue Sky post.
2661637	2676561	Oh, no, it was a Blue Sky post because I saw it on Blue Sky, where somebody at Taito took a black and white photo of Japanese players surrounding a Darius cabinet, and they ran it through generative AI to kind of clean the picture up.
2676541	2691225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2692100	2697555	I wanna see, let me see if I can actually find that post here on Blue Sky to kind of fall down this rabbit hole a little bit.
2697575	2702649	Okay, so I'm gonna show you and I'm gonna narrate best I can for those that are listening on the podcast.
2702669	2707543	So on the other screen, I'm actually showing that post from VG Densetsu on Blue Sky.
2707523	2712069	who actually links and quote posts the Taito.co.jp post.
2712530	2721203	And this post actually reads, it's written in Japanese, but if you want to just use the rough Google translation, it's basically saying, hey, today is Darius release day.
2721543	2725268	The original Darius was first on October 7th and 8th, 1986.
2725589	2728553	So basically like, hey, Darius was released today.
2728533	2757763	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2757743	2759988	This game that's being played is called WANDAS.
2760550	2765642	This is generative AI that was failed to be quality checked.
2765742	2770534	And what VG Densetsu did was they actually said, this looks familiar.
2770554	2774183	Here's the original photo where you can see that the
2774163	2776046	Young looking gentleman in the front.
2776066	2778149	Actually, boy in the front really is what it looks like.
2778710	2784179	And you can see that Darius, you know, even though it's like obscured with lighting and stuff, you can see it's clear here.
2784580	2790990	This black and white picture is what officially Taito and their official look back.
2791257	2810143	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2810697	2815645	If you're going to do something like this to look back, disclose it.
2815665	2823978	Just say, you know what, we thought we'd work with AI to show what this scene might look like today.
2823998	2830849	And I'm sure people will spit their tongue out at it and go, you know, but at least you would have disclosed it.
2831065	2831646	as well.
2832066	2833288	Quite a few.
2833388	2835091	It's very obvious they used the AI.
2835772	2838455	It erodes trust.
2838555	2843743	Or they could have paid somebody to colorize it or try to colorize it.
2843883	2844103	Absolutely.
2844324	2845505	All of those things true.
2845705	2849591	But instead, this is what they did and it erodes trust with the community.
2849911	2853216	How are we supposed to look back and celebrate with you when it's fake?
2853516	2855419	This is a fake celebration.
2857137	2874252	if you want to do this just disclose it because then again then you can roll your eyes at it and go whatever but at least you're not being dishonest this is dishonest or show the original picture and this and say you know again we thought we'd work with AI to see what it would look like in this
2874383	2875345	Or just don't.
2875365	2877329	Just don't show the original picture.
2877510	2878852	That's a great idea.
2878892	2880275	Don't show the remake.
2880376	2883081	Just show only the one.
2883422	2884905	Just be like, here you go.
2885025	2885727	It's black and white.
2886468	2888713	That's what pictures used to look like.
2888795	2891220	I don't know, just something.
2891260	2892844	They don't need to explain themselves.
2892884	2895108	Just, okay, here's what we've got.
2895229	2895609	Cool.
2895650	2896471	Let's celebrate it.
2896491	2897934	We don't need it being color.
2899077	2901722	Looking at chat, a lot of people yelling, Wayness.
2902765	2903165	Let's see.
2903546	2906753	I'm reading the replies right now.
2907290	2909453	It's hilarious.
2909473	2915020	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I was waiting for Ted Turner to try to colorize the first 20 minutes of The Wizard of Oz.
2915040	2916702	Actually legit for the 1930s.
2916863	2929880	If you watch the behind the scenes of how they did that effect from when it went to black and white, although it was more of a sepia, like sepia to color, like the way they did that was actually amazing for the 1930s.
2930060	2932183	But anyway, I'm getting way off track.
2932163	2953513	um let's see um uh Quest Buster says I can't wait for Wayness to show up in a new collection I think that's a fear too I think that's a good thing that Taito's getting called out on because how long until Taito asks us to pay for a collection of retro games that has been enhanced with AI
2954506	2957953	Again, disclose it or have there be a choice.
2958374	2962101	Would you like to play the original or would you like to play the AI enhanced version?
2963023	2966450	Or even better, pay the people to do it by hand.
2966470	2973224	But we're all foolish if we're sitting here going, surely the industry is not going to go this direction.
2973244	2974827	They're trying to cut all sorts of corners.
2974947	2976210	I mean, of course they are.
2976629	2983818	So that's why we've got to use our voices while we can, even when it's an issue, as simple as a fucking picture.
2983838	2984880	And yeah, the replies.
2984900	2987343	Did you find any really good replies, DarkSakura?
2987683	2989125	I'm just quickly scrolling through.
2989145	2991809	A few of the ones in Japanese are just going, this is shameful.
2992189	2996435	You are harming your history.
2997997	2998097	Yeah.
2999832	3006818	Hold on, let me... I found Rinmari's reply and I gave it a like from the OLR account that says, can't spell Taito without AI.
3010261	3011342	What is this one?
3014224	3019469	No, that doesn't have anything to do with... There's a few of them on here.
3020229	3022471	This may have been a mistake.
3022551	3029417	Please do not rewrite history by reconstructing by AI, one of the Japanese things.
3029532	3038901	DarkSakura
3040248	3044194	Um, maybe.
3044214	3065168	So, um, we have been seeing, uh, the staff, at least the original, uh, staff for Halo slowly trickling out, and we have, um, another person to that, uh, one of the art directors that worked on the series for 17 years.
3065649	3065749	Okay.
3065729	3088851	Thank you for watching!
3088831	3099547	He put a statement on his LinkedIn page that said he was leaving the developer now known as Halo Studios and said he would tell more in the future.
3099567	3106637	And I'll just read what the post says, because I think it's very interesting in its entirety.
3107022	3112076	As of today, after 17 long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe.
3112658	3120801	There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it's absolutely safe to do so next year.
3120861	3122466	So I'm guessing NDA.
3122446	3125890	In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.
3126611	3131076	I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are free to choose.
3131616	3140586	No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth treating away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values, and no one can force you to.
3141227	3145652	Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.
3147505	3150488	Do you see where I take that jump and say AI?
3150808	3153310	And Grant, I am completely making shit up.
3153330	3158415	I know nothing about the inner stuff, but I can't help but read into that statement.
3158435	3162118	Hmm.
3162138	3162959	Hmm.
3162979	3168204	But it could be a few things, but just knowing where the industry has been going, I don't know.
3169605	3170646	I think it's a reasonable guess.
3171407	3174870	What has been on there is the health and dignity.
3175551	3175791	Mm-hmm.
3176885	3180550	Mixed me think that that might also have something to do with crunch as well.
3180851	3182634	Could be, fair.
3182654	3185358	Yeah, maybe the working conditions just aren't great.
3185378	3189003	I mean, I'm definitely sure AI has a bit to go into it as well.
3189764	3201762	And honestly, the game itself isn't really retaining the same player base they had before.
3203598	3212853	Yeah, and that's what, you know, with all the Xbox talk we did at the top of the show, I don't think like, oh, it's the Halo box really means as much as it used to.
3213794	3215597	You know what I mean?
3215617	3216499	No, not really.
3216519	3220645	It's the Forza Horizon box now for me and many people.
3221306	3223870	So, all right.
3223890	3228137	Or in my case, it's that I haven't given a shit about this box in a long time.
3228944	3247881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3248452	3251737	It doesn't matter if you're posting it to Twitter.
3251757	3254081	And I know a lot of Japanese folks are still on Twitter.
3254242	3271129	And DeviantArt put in a clause back in... It was around the time I got off of it, which was over a decade ago, that they could use your artwork for profitability.
3271149	3272652	And that went right into AI.
3272672	3272772	Okay.
3273882	3283156	And I'm pretty sure BlueSky and Mastodon both have like don't use us for AI type of things, at least depending on the Mastodon server probably.
3283496	3289405	But again, because both are public facing and posts are public, there really isn't anything to stop AI.
3289926	3293511	So you kind of have to be mindful of anything that you post publicly.
3293677	3294959	could.
3295079	3320072	Now, maybe you post something like that to pursue legal action later on, but if you don't have the resources to pursue legal action, unfortunately, you're going to... That's why for once in my life, I'm cheering on the big Hollywood organizations like Disney and Universal and stuff that are taking these AI companies to task because these deviant art artists and other artists we've named so far don't have the resources to fight legally what AI is doing.
3320052	3348152	a precedent needs to be established on what AI can and cannot train off of and it's Disney that's going to have to fight that at all that are going to have to fight that fight for us I'm just going to say there's been a big reason why instead of offering people digital art when I do like like for example for my subathon or something if I have you can win artwork for me there's a reason I'm not doing it digitally it is it is
3349297	3366259	Copic Marker or Paint and I deliver it to you in a physical form alright well let's move on and talk about the launch of a big game that people are playing on Xbox and other consoles right Loki?
3366695	3368417	Yeah, Battlefield 6 just launched.
3368998	3372922	And as such, I was kind of curious to see how it would do.
3372942	3376346	Obviously, a lot of people were really anticipating that game coming back.
3376946	3378127	And so, yeah, it did very well.
3378148	3382672	700,000 concurrent players on Steam.
3383433	3388239	At one time, there were some screenshots going around because there were some issues connecting to the game.
3388559	3391182	They had 350,000 people in queue.
3391882	3396027	So that's a lot.
3396007	3411398	And then with your typical launch with a lot of these games and all the different content packages that you have to download, there were some other issues with the game running, basically saying that you need to install some additional content that you may have already had installed.
3411438	3413222	And of course, DICE was looking into it.
3413202	3413643	What?
3413963	3414804	That's so crazy.
3415125	3422735	They're looking into an issue with their launched game and not blaming the players for having shitty computers or anything like that?
3423056	3424037	This is crazy!
3424398	3427442	How are they running a business like this?
3427462	3428163	I don't know.
3428183	3432489	But apparently it's working for them because, you know, 700,000 players playing that game.
3432509	3433050	Yeah.
3434212	3437817	And that's the thing that will keep Microsoft afloat at the end of the day, right?
3437877	3439659	Or excuse me, Battlefield's EA.
3439679	3440901	Sorry, Battlefield's EA.
3441822	3442603	Sorry.
3442623	3447329	Look, I have never professed to be the expert on the shooty, shooty, bang, bang games, okay?
3447429	3452556	So, but yeah, but of course, obviously we talked at length about what EA's facing, you know, last week and yeah.
3452576	3454338	Yep.
3454499	3461167	It will be curious to see what Black Ops 7 does, especially considering, you know, the backlash with all the Xbox stuff.
3461508	3461788	Mm-hmm.
3463102	3463543	I don't know.
3463943	3464404	We'll see.
3465726	3466587	Maybe it'll make a difference.
3466647	3467128	Maybe not.
3467749	3469372	I think it's going to make some a difference.
3469652	3480348	But I think also with Call of Duty especially, it's really gone the Fortnite route where they're just throwing everything at the wall.
3481550	3484755	Just with all the tie-ins with...
3485512	3490560	rappers, other pop culture things, actors.
3491101	3495589	I want to say, I think they did have like some people in, well, yeah, because Jay and Silent Bob were in there as well.
3496991	3503001	Just all sorts of pop culture stuff that doesn't necessarily lend itself to Call of Duty.
3504964	3509452	Just throwing that all in there just to make up more money with cosmetics.
3509472	3510253	Like it's just...
3511448	3538519	so it'll be interesting to see what happens this year how that how a successful Battlefield 6 is going to impact their game and that's good because if it does impact their game then that means that hey we can't just put the slop out we need to really tool our game and innovate and so that's what it's going to take is innovation because you know the last few years of Call of Duty not really innovative and that's because they didn't have to compete against Battlefield yeah
3540102	3547877	Alright, well let's move on and talk about something that caught a lot of people's eye this week that wasn't necessarily a game, but it was certainly inspired by a game.
3548318	3551444	It was an animated short that was put out by Nintendo.
3551464	3555712	And when the short first came out, people were a little bit confused what it was all about.
3555772	3560541	It was kind of a Pixar-esque sort of animated short that showed, you know, a child...
3560521	3564707	and some people caught some references to Pikmin within the short.
3564727	3569073	And sure enough, the next day it was shown that, yep, it has to do with Pikmin.
3569133	3571376	It's a little short that involves Pikmin.
3571817	3579147	Nintendo put out a statement saying, we hope you enjoyed the two close to you videos released on October 7th and 8th.
3579528	3582552	The second video is available on Nintendo Today.
3582652	3589482	So that was kind of interesting that they put out that teaser and then wanted people to go to the Nintendo Today app to see the second half, which of course got...
3589462	3597001	I don't think it was the second half, it was just that it was a different version.
3597301	3603356	There was one that hid that it was Pikmin in there doing all the things.
3603396	3604740	It was just invisible.
3604920	3606103	And then, yeah.
3606083	3614233	But the real important part here is that these were short films created by Nintendo Pictures Company Limited.
3614253	3621642	Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content, and that was put out by Nintendo.
3621662	3628851	And I couldn't help but have flashbacks to the 3DS era when you used to be able to download those 3DS movies like Dinosaur Office and stuff.
3628831	3634537	Like, I was like, oh, this would have been a great thing for Nintendo to have a picture studio for then.
3635097	3649131	I don't know if they're creating shorts to add value to the Nintendo Today app, or could they eventually, you know, now that like the Nintendo Cinematic Universe is very clearly a thing, we're getting a Mario movie sequel, a Zelda movie is happening.
3649151	3651413	It will almost certainly do very well.
3651433	3655718	We're not living in the age of the 90s video game translations anymore.
3655998	3658180	Many video game translations into media are
3658160	3660183	are being, you know, well received.
3660203	3664509	You know, there's still a few stinkers in there, but most of them are pretty well received and do well.
3664990	3669736	Could Nintendo end up making their own movie?
3670057	3679711	You know, maybe in partnership with probably Universal or one of their distribution partners, but could Nintendo make their own movie, whether it be Pikmin or question mark, question mark, something else?
3679731	3681513	Bring the Animal Crossing movie over here.
3681834	3683035	Localize the Animal Crossing movie.
3683055	3683216	Why not?
3683236	3684377	Why not an Animal Crossing movie?
3684397	3685819	Who knows?
3685839	3686260	So...
3687151	3688673	It's a cute movie.
3688693	3692379	MikeDev says, and no people were not getting a Smash movie.
3692399	3707243	Never say never, but it certainly wouldn't have... Well, again, never say never, but there's a lot of... Like, to have every character, there would have to be a lot of agreements with other parties, namely the Pokemon Company, but... Maybe the original Smash.
3707323	3707904	Maybe.
3707924	3708946	I mean, Pokemon Company.
3708966	3709547	Who's...
3709527	3712392	I feel like everything is figureoutable when it comes to making money.
3713654	3718222	But I just feel like cinematically, there's a long way to go.
3718242	3721828	And it doesn't play out the way y'all think it plays out.
3721948	3724493	Nintendo is not fucking Marvel.
3724893	3729581	So the Smash movie does not happen like the fucking original Iron Man movie and the ending and all that shit.
3729601	3730283	That's not happening.
3730303	3731164	Get it out of your head.
3732342	3739779	But maybe an animated series or yeah, maybe a Smash movie and some other type of universe could happen.
3740600	3749440	But I think we're like at least a decade away from having the Nintendo Cinematic Universe established enough to even get to that sort of spot.
3750432	3751674	Yes, it is.
3751774	3779815	Yes.
3779795	3780977	It is.
3781017	3785543	They've already, some of the casting stuff is, you know, whatever you want to believe.
3785563	3787066	But we know they're filming in New Zealand.
3787126	3788267	That we know, right?
3788768	3790711	So, you know.
3792253	3795718	TigerClaw says, you thank Sonic for making video game movies good.
3796159	3797260	Was that the first one?
3797280	3799944	I know it was a big box office success.
3799964	3803890	No, there's like Detective Pikachu and all that stuff before.
3804150	3809498	I sort of feel like it was The Witcher, which I know was based off a book.
3809815	3821086	but the Netflix series was the game and I really feel like the one-two punch of The Witcher and the Castlevania anime is what opened the floodgates to what we have now.
3821246	3823508	But sure, the Sonic movie helped.
3824289	3829434	Sonic is a well-established franchise.
3829854	3833257	Sonic is an Iron Man in its own thing.
3833277	3835860	It's a well-established movie franchise now.
3835880	3839383	And same thing with Minecraft at this point, which we'll get to later.
3839633	3844158	Alright, anyway, but for now, let's talk about other popular gaming IPs.
3844218	3844902	DarkSakura.
3846535	3860872	So, I have brought up, by the way, a site before that was trying to get mobile games and old Keitai games to be able to be ripped and put available for other people.
3860892	3865778	And there was one in particular, there's a game that they thought they would never get.
3866438	3873186	It was a Ratchet & Clank mobile game that was actually a cancelled game.
3873246	3876390	It was called Ratchet & Clank Clone Home.
3876370	3904690	and they actually have found a phone, a Sony Ericsson that had this game on it definitely needed some polish but it was on the Sony Ericsson W880i and encrypted they said it was going to be hopeless to get it off of there but then they managed to crack the phone's encryption extract the game and archive it
3904670	3909988	and it is complete and fully playable.
3910340	3924061	The thought had been that it was developed by handheld games, but it was more likely a company called JavaGround that did Sony's... The last few J2ME games, the Java games.
3924943	3932274	And that it might have even been accidentally uploaded to Singular or Sprint for a little while, and then people were able to download it.
3932294	3933376	A lot of people say it's really good.
3934177	3934778	Yeah.
3934758	3943727	You can play as two different Lumbaxes and you get a gun called the UZ, E-W-E-Z-I-E, that turns your enemies into sheep.
3947111	3955800	The only reason that anyone could think of was why it may have been cancelled in the first place was some litigation between Sony and Handheld.
3957802	3959423	But this one is out.
3959443	3960985	You can download it off the Archive.
3964390	3974448	Love to see games lost to time make their way back, even when they're kind of, you know, old, old phone games that I remember my crappy little Sprint phone and some of the games that were on that.
3974468	3976231	And that's probably where this game was meant to be played.
3976331	3981661	So this was set to be released in 2006 for Java phones.
3982242	3983344	Attracts.
3983364	3985007	So, but yeah, there you go.
3985287	3986950	Neat.
3986970	3987070	Loki.
3987090	3987411	Loki.
3989180	3996231	Alright, well, unfortunately some bad news as far as studios shutting down or having layoffs.
3996812	4012858	So first, we have an indie studio, of course, Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash has announced that they're winding down their development of Hyper Light Breaker, and this is coming right after they had layoffs announced.
4012838	4019687	As we wrap up our work at Hyper Light Breaker, we've had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members.
4020067	4024733	This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.
4026555	4039572	They said that the news reflects broader forces beyond our control, including a shift in funding, corporate consolidation, and uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.
4040463	4050574	And then, fortunately, to go along with that, we have, of course, The Outsiders, which is the developer of Metal Hellsinger, and they are shutting down.
4051195	4057162	So it says, you know, change is always tough, and right now we're all hurting.
4058663	4066071	But yeah, they have announced their studio closure, which was only 10 years old.
4066091	4067533	So that's unfortunate.
4068695	4071220	Another week, another two studios shutting down.
4071341	4075329	When does the madness end?
4075349	4081021	Yeah, I don't think... Well, at least the one... Heart Machine's not shutting down when they're laying off people, though.
4081041	4082284	Okay, sorry.
4082444	4084208	Two studios doing layoffs, I guess.
4084629	4087615	But still, it's just wild.
4088405	4092433	All right, let's talk a little bit about Fortnite.
4093555	4097162	Because Fortnite, you can create things for Fortnite.
4097422	4107662	And when you do create things, you can get a little bit of money for that, depending on how many people are interacting with the things that you created.
4107642	4113309	Two Michigan-based Fortnite creators are being sued by Epic Games.
4113429	4121500	In the allegations, it's said that the two defendants created 20,000 bots to inflate the popularity of their maps.
4121940	4127787	Which, you know, again, if you're trying to get to the top of the rankings to get discovered, it sounds like Twitch viewbotting.
4127808	4129810	It's Twitch viewbotting, but in Fortnite.
4129830	4131372	So it's like that, basically, okay?
4131392	4133435	Or YouTube botting, or any of those types of sites, right?
4133995	4135337	So...
4135672	4145404	Once they get that, then they get a little more of that organic growth, but you used fake growth to get there, which is a big no-no.
4145424	4149829	Basically, it pushes you to the top of the search or the front page.
4149849	4153333	You see this happen on mobile store things a lot, too.
4153534	4156637	I think the same thing happens in Roblox and stuff as well.
4156817	4164767	Basically, they pay to have these bots push you to the front page, and most of the kids and stuff that are playing these maps or playing these games in Fortnite...
4164747	4169632	or Roblox, they're not scrolling through multiple pages to find something.
4169672	4170533	They're like, yeah, that looks good.
4170553	4172055	We'll take that and play that.
4172315	4174617	And so that's kind of what's happening here.
4174657	4191295	It sounds like where it went on, which is very interesting because Epic in their allegations say that the defendants were trying to go around the terms of service, having the bots flood the islands, and they were doing it, quote, using a cloud gaming service that allowed users to play video games like Fortnite remotely.
4191275	4221282	and then the defendants supposedly earned tens of thousands of dollars through this but Epic finally caught them and said you have to stop playing the game and destroy all copies of Fortnite that sounds like a cease and desist to me basically that they were told you have broken the rules and you are banned from Fortnite forever and you don't make any money because that violated the terms of agreement that you signed however they didn't stop and that's where the lawsuit comes in so Epic said
4221262	4236418	... ... ... ... ... ... ...
4236466	4239371	but they're Bloodline from playing Fortnite.
4239391	4240592	You can't do that.
4240893	4242355	It is weird, isn't it?
4242415	4243998	But that's what it is.
4244018	4248084	Your children's children's children do not get to fort the night.
4248365	4255416	What in the name of ancient royal punishment is this?
4255976	4257339	The three generation rule?
4257679	4258981	The seven generation rule?
4259963	4262046	It's very interesting.
4262266	4263368	No.
4263753	4270579	But I mean, well, that part is a little nonsense, but obviously... Dishonor on your cow!
4271240	4283030	If these guys were viewbotting, which it sounds like, or, you know, I'm sorry, but the equivalent of that, which it sounds like Epic has the evidence and the receipts to show that, then, yeah, the punishment is you're banned.
4283631	4285132	Like, and you don't get to make money.
4286433	4293760	Obviously, the generational ban's a little silly, but, you know, maybe this is one of those cases where they're asking for more, knowing they'll get less.
4293740	4319697	We'll see.
4321955	4328885	I probably would have been like all morning and all kinds of stuff, but no.
4329126	4334774	Dr. Demento has played his official last show ever.
4337899	4339061	So, yeah.
4340683	4342506	Brad, he is not pulling an OLR.
4343167	4344469	He is Dr. Demento.
4345850	4347533	He pulls Dr. Demento.
4349235	4364139	His final traditional episode came out on May 31st, and then he announced his retirement and said he was going to host retrospective episodes that would count down his favorite records decade by decade.
4365320	4366482	I mean, the man's 84.
4367003	4367464	He's earned it.
4368245	4372752	But he did his final...
4372732	4384532	Episode three and a half hours long extravaganza, counting down his top 40 most demanded, demented discs and tapes from across his career.
4386054	4390121	So, I mean, he started in 1970 in Pasadena.
4390862	4393527	And if not for him, would we have had Weird Al?
4393547	4393727	Weird Al?
4394551	4394952	Maybe not.
4394972	4396273	Who else had he given?
4397035	4405186	I think Judy Tanuta and just a bunch of... Who wrote that song that went star trekking across the universe?
4405286	4406788	Across the universe.
4408651	4409212	That song.
4409693	4411135	Whoever did that.
4411295	4411796	Captain Kirk.
4411816	4411996	Yeah.
4412537	4418605	I mean, it's really... Okay.
4420248	4420508	Yeah.
4421109	4421349	R.I.P.
4421369	4422030	Judy Tanuta.
4422751	4423292	Um...
4423525	4425829	Dark Tetsuya, Dr. Demento.
4426450	4429054	Did you see Weird at all?
4429114	4430737	The Weird Al movie with Daniel Radcliffe.
4431097	4436986	But anyway, he wore a top hat and everything and did his show.
4437587	4440051	He looked like a guy that would call himself Dr. Demento.
4441394	4444298	Yeah, the man's amazing.
4446381	4448605	But he...
4451167	4458619	He played It's a Gas on his show, which is just burps.
4458799	4464869	But anyway, you've definitely earned your retirement, Dr. Demento.
4464989	4465770	We salute you.
4468234	4477309	Thank you for giving us, gosh, since the 70s, 55 years.
4478352	4479656	Yes, Dr. Domeno.
4479676	4482827	Absolute joy and bizarreness.
4483469	4484854	Dr. Domeno, we salute you.
4484894	4485997	We salute you so hard.
4486017	4487121	We're going to do the same thing.
4487141	4487522	Good night.
4488747	4491315	I'm attacking the darkness.
4492612	4493693	Yeah, the Dead L. Wives.
4493934	4494454	We got that.
4494494	4495395	We got boot to the head.
4496096	4506669	To the credit of PodCulture's joke earlier saying I gotta get better joke writers, I mean, like, I thank Dr. Domeno because now it's a very convenient excuse when somebody says, well, why now?
4506709	4510974	I'll be like, well, Dr. Domeno did it.
4510994	4511375	All right.
4511575	4516801	Anyway, let's get to the classic game of the week.
4516841	4519024	And of course, we got to run the bump to make that happen.
4529416	4536827	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4537308	4541254	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4541274	4542696	And you get a weird one tonight.
4542956	4544719	What's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4545841	4550007	The game is IS, Internal Section.
4550240	4556747	This is a PlayStation game that was developed by Positron and published by Square, released in 1999.
4557208	4572805	It is a tube shooter, like Tempest 2000 and Nitrous Oxide, where you sort of look down a tube and then you move around and shoot enemies that are coming toward you through the tube.
4572869	4582762	and this one was an experimental project and it responds to these built-in tracks kind of like what Vibraban did.
4583343	4590693	You can even put in your own music CD and so the levels will change based on the music.
4592676	4592976	Yeah.
4595580	4597743	Rimari says I'm also getting disoriented.
4597763	4598904	Yes, it is disorienting.
4599245	4601087	It's a great game though.
4602434	4610853	and it has 12 different weapons, all of which are named from the Chinese Zodiac and it's flat shaded models.
4611034	4618030	Your ship and your enemies are just simple polygons and it has, you know, that late 90s, you know, electronica.
4618010	4621334	But like I said, you can play any music that you want to.
4621915	4627002	It was released on January 28th, 1999 for the PlayStation, published by Square.
4627563	4629706	It was never released outside of Japan.
4630146	4634111	It has been re-released for PSN's Game Archives in Japan.
4634792	4642903	And a track from the game was released in the compilation CD Square Enix Battle Tracks Volume 3, Square 1999-2000.
4643491	4649619	Famitsu gave it a 24 out of 40, which, you know, not bad for Famitsu.
4652103	4655968	Video Games, I guess another magazine, gave it a 4 out of 5 score.
4656088	4661356	Gamers Republic said that it was one of the best games to import from Japan that year.
4661696	4670088	It also included Bangaio, an Evangelion game, Pepsi Man, Robot Dandy, and The Adventures of Little Ralph on the list.
4670228	4673312	Some decent games, although Pepsi Man is questionable.
4673292	4700413	um in 2015 Retro Gamer Magazine uh listed it as number five on those the 20 greatest PlayStation games you've never played although I've played it and it was fun so there you go yeah it's pretty trippy looking I mean it's it's a fun game for me I it kind of sets my brain off after a while and I have to stop but um but it's it's a fun one and the fact that you can put in different discs and make it a different game every time
4701001	4703406	Yeah, I get Super Hexagon vibes a little bit from this.
4703446	4707474	It's almost a little too flashy, but if you turn the brightness down, it might be doable.
4707574	4712825	But it's definitely... This is very much a PlayStation-era game to me.
4713627	4714148	Absolutely.
4715030	4722064	And it's a game that you're really not going to be able to do a repeat of...
4722044	4722825	Yeah.
4725488	4751038	Yeah.
4751913	4752394	All right.
4753635	4755437	Yeah, Dark City brings up Audio Surf.
4755457	4757960	Yeah, that's probably the closest we had.
4758160	4763005	And then there was a sequel to Audio Surf that I swear you just never heard about.
4763065	4765408	Like, it happened, but anyway.
4765428	4765728	All right.
4766008	4766649	Well, great pick.
4766689	4770113	Thank you for the classic game of the week.
4770413	4779323	All right, we're going to get back into some more news, but we're going to do some quick headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
4779363	4780384	Loki.
4780482	4783208	This is all about Minecraft stuff!
4783228	4783669	Shocking.
4784771	4789381	So, a bit of a fun thing, and then, of course, we're going to talk about the second movie.
4790383	4798761	So the first thing, obviously, remember that Sonic Racing Crossworlds just came out, and it just came out on PC, so what's that mean?
4798741	4828596	mods of course and so to be silly somebody has taken the Jack Black iteration of Minecraft Steve and put it in the game as well as the Minecraft skin version of Steve in there as well and the chicken jockey and it has of course all the one-liners from the movie yeah and it's exactly what you expect but I thought that was pretty funny
4828643	4857435	then of course Mojang has announced or I should say Microsoft's announced even that Minecraft is getting a second movie it'll be coming out July 23rd 2027 there's something to help Microsoft make money amongst all these other bad news yeah so cool look forward to seeing that in a few years look forward to seeing how the kids Rocky Horror this one
4859002	4862487	By the way, on a completely personal selfish note, go ahead.
4863048	4873885	I was going to mention about Rocky Horror, actually, because when we were at the movie theater yesterday, they were selling, you know, all the expensive popcorn buckets that you can get for, like, a bunch of things.
4873905	4877731	Like, they're really pushing those popcorn buckets hard, like, for Tron.
4879073	4881577	They had some, like, Dude Perfect movie and stuff.
4881597	4882258	I was like...
4882711	4883172	Why?
4883272	4886559	Who wants a Dude Perfect popcorn bucket?
4886579	4893274	But they had one for Rocky Horror Picture Show, so I'm wondering if they're doing some big Fathom event thing in theaters or something like that.
4893294	4897002	They already did 4D screenings because a lot of our cast went.
4897122	4899066	I missed it, but...
4899046	4903172	It is the 50th anniversary of Rocky Horror, and that's actually what I was going to talk about.
4903232	4907297	So I was going to say, if you've never seen it before, it's playing everywhere now for the 50th.
4907337	4912224	But I would say don't see it in a normal movie theater because you're not going to get the full experience.
4912244	4915669	You've got to go do one where the cast is doing it in front of the screen.
4915689	4917492	The regulars are there yelling the lines.
4918473	4918573	Yeah.
4918553	4924020	We have one in Sacramento coming up, self-plug here, right at the end of the month on the 25th.
4924420	4929266	I will say that show is probably about four-fifths on its way to being sold out.
4929746	4931569	So get on it.
4931689	4935593	But in your neck of the woods, they may have some screenings that are still available.
4935714	4943683	I know that Barry, Pat, and Nell, three of the stars of the film, are all touring around the country everywhere.
4943663	4964035	DarkSakura
4965415	4973444	So, Switch Online has just received some other games, some snussy stuff.
4973464	4984115	We now have Mario & Wario, Bubsy & Claw's Encounters of the Third Kind, and Fatal Fury Special, all for Switch 2 and for Switch.
4984135	4992604	Mario & Wario was only released in Japan on Super Famicom, and it has other options for mouse controls on Switch 2.
4993276	4994157	Yeah, I'll have to check that out.
4994277	4997221	I've never played that, and I've been curious about it, so cool.
4998903	5006993	All right, well, let's talk about Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII remasters.
5007133	5011939	Yes, they are being re-released in a twin pack for the Nintendo Switch.
5012039	5017225	They're coming out on December 9th, along with a Final Fantasy IX physical edition.
5017205	5032280	These versions were actually already released in Asia in a physical edition, but these are now coming out for the US just in time for the holidays for folks that maybe want to pick this up for whatever reason in a physical way.
5032300	5035568	I should point out this is not the Final Fantasy VII Remake.
5035548	5044076	This is the Final Fantasy VII Remaster that's kind of cycled its way through PC and PlayStation 4 and it's been, you know, here and there and everywhere.
5044096	5048580	But if you want that and Final Fantasy VIII in a combo pack, that is available.
5048600	5051743	I'm going to be honest, I did not like the Final Fantasy VIII Remaster.
5051843	5055446	And I know I've had my share of Duncan on Final Fantasy VIII over the years and my issues with it.
5055846	5058308	It's not, that has nothing to do with the Remaster.
5058449	5064674	I just, I really, really hated how you had some things that were changed and some things that weren't on top of each other.
5064694	5065555	I think it's a terrible look.
5065535	5091154	DarkSakura.com
5091843	5097064	Let's get into traveling around and check out some release dates and things coming a little sooner than December 9th.
5097606	5100216	Loki, you want to start us off with the US release dates?
5100668	5123217	Yep, we've got Chicken Hair and The Treasure of Spiking Beard That's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Yeah, I can't believe that they're still making them Just Dance 2026 Edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series
5123197	5127105	Also, NASCAR 25 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5127986	5135882	Ball X Pit or Ball Cross Pit on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5135902	5138267	Cuff Bust on PC.
5139309	5144158	Blood West on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5144138	5154933	Ghost Traveler, Adventure Zenido on PC and Nintendo Switch, Overthrown coming out of Early Access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5155453	5162603	Also coming out of Early Access, we have Pax Dei on PC.
5162583	5167648	Pokemon Legends ZA on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.
5168569	5174234	We've got Kaku Ancient Seal on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
5174854	5177777	Keeper on PC and Xbox Series.
5178538	5183462	Lumo 2 on PC, Linux, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5.
5184543	5187626	Fantasy War... Or Fantasy... Oh, I'm sorry.
5187646	5188987	That's actually next week.
5189007	5189788	I...
5189768	5191029	Just notice that's the 21st.
5191490	5192030	That's it then.
5192531	5192751	Okay.
5193251	5195754	Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the releases there.
5195794	5203101	Obviously, for the Switch 2, Pokemon Legends ZA is a huge release and is released in Japan this week.
5203141	5205463	I'm pretty sure that's got to be a worldwide date for that.
5206124	5210768	There are a variety of accessories, most of them third-party, that are also coming out to match that.
5211749	5215793	But it's also worth pointing out because, you know, there were some –
5215773	5221045	chat in the chat for the show earlier, kind of about like, is Pokemon Legends a mainline game?
5221105	5221987	Is it a new gen?
5222027	5222748	What is it?
5222909	5224653	It's a main game.
5224673	5225655	I think Def put it best.
5225675	5228501	It's a main game, but it's not like a new generation.
5228521	5233171	It kind of revisits an old generation and puts a new spin on it with pretty much any Pokemon that's out there.
5233191	5233512	But the
5233492	5239821	Other interesting thing about it, it does not do the whole X, Y, Red, Blue, Sun, Moon.
5239841	5240422	It doesn't do that.
5240442	5248914	There's one game, which I think is a good thing because all the damn Pokemon you want are in the game, or at least that you'll be able to get that gen.
5248934	5250897	But they'll be happy to sell you a DLC later, I'm sure.
5251017	5255123	Anyway, so Legends is your big Switch 2 release this week, obviously.
5255223	5259349	Going over to the PlayStation 5, we have a game called Star Bites.
5259369	5262553	It's out in Japan this week on the 16th.
5262533	5265661	and that may be the only counter programming.
5265702	5270374	Yeah, we don't really get any other big releases until we get to next week in Japan.
5271216	5274104	But not too surprising because Pokemon is going to be everywhere.
5275087	5277032	So DarkSakura, what do you have for the UK?
5277856	5279579	Oh, just this and that.
5279759	5299328	On the 14th for Switch, we have Just Dance 2026 Edition, P1 Angerlight for PS5, Rising Heat for PC, Chicken Hair and the Treasure of Spiking Beard for PC, PS5, Xbox, Switch, NASCAR 25 for the consoles.
5300289	5305156	On the 15th, we have Ball X Pit, or Ball and Pit?
5305176	5306398	For Switch and Switch 2 and PC.
5307340	5307660	Oh.
5308332	5310199	I mean, basically it's ball pit.
5310219	5311022	It's just fancy.
5313450	5315156	Okay.
5315176	5316682	I'm being silly.
5317685	5318890	I just want a real ball pit now.
5318970	5320114	Can we have that please?
5320634	5347873	Pokemon Legends Z-A for Switch, Switch 2 Fellowship for PC The Cabin Factory for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox Time Trekker for Switch Hitman, Absolution, iOS and Android Pokemon Legends Z-A, Mega Dimension, DLC, Holo X and Holo Y apparel items I just read the whole thing aloud now realizing they were talking about clothing No, that says Switch and Switch 2, never mind That's clothing in-game Yes, you can...
5347853	5348474	Buy that.
5349335	5353541	Also on the 16th, we have Reach for MetaQuest, PSVR 2, SteamVR.
5354102	5372607	We have on the 17th, Keeper for Xboxes and PC, Away From Home for PC, Lumo 2 Switch, PS5, Xboxes, Kaku, Ancient Seal for PS5, Xboxes, and the Elf on the Shelf, Christmas Heroes, PS5, PS4, Xboxes, Switch, and PC also on the 17th.
5375331	5375671	All right.
5375692	5376072	Okay.
5376541	5380407	Why do we need an Elf on the Shelf game?
5380427	5381409	They've had several.
5382150	5384694	This is not the first.
5384714	5388179	Somebody's buying them, sadly.
5388239	5390723	I want the Minch on the Bench game.
5390843	5396713	Outside of Christmas nights, why buy any Christmas game for any system?
5396773	5397554	Christmas Lemmings.
5397814	5399196	Christmas Lemmings.
5399216	5402562	But Christmas Lemmings wasn't that horrible.
5402602	5404084	It's like 30 years old.
5404537	5409984	Well, hold on, it's 30 years old, but that was also more of like, here's a shareware disc type of game.
5410104	5416352	It was like a demo, essentially, with a skin on it.
5416372	5420637	I think I have like four different copies of Christmas Nights, including a Japanese one.
5421138	5422099	I disagree.
5422119	5432873	I would love to see more special Christmas things, and all holidays, all representation for what people get into in December, but I would love to see, like, I love it in MMOs.
5432853	5461594	I love it when like the big holiday trees are up and like the Final Fantasy plazas and the game I play and things like that I would love to see like Pokemon Legends ZA like look at the main town get like a holiday makeover and stuff like I think that would be so cool I say bring more Christmas games or at least more Christmas theming and all holidays I think y'all know optional theming is fine but like a dedicated Christmas game like when's that if it's not Gremlins I'm not interested
5461574	5467062	Is your child really going to be playing the Elf on the Shelf game in June of this year?
5467082	5468985	Like, oh man, I gotta get back.
5469005	5471409	I gotta get my homework done so I can play the Elf on the Shelf game.
5471609	5473652	But there's people that watch Christmas movies all year round.
5473732	5475054	Like Elf is a good example.
5475074	5477338	And they are freaks, but you know what?
5477358	5481103	Okay, so Elf is the only acceptable Christmas movie to watch all the time.
5482045	5485610	I mean, when am I going to get my Hebrew Hammer adventure game?
5485630	5486772	And Batman Returns.
5489148	5492512	I want the Hebrew Hammer as an adventure game.
5492532	5494414	But no, not Die Hard, folks.
5494494	5494915	Not Die Hard.
5494935	5496596	You can only watch Die Hard at Christmas.
5496616	5501242	I'm sorry.
5501262	5502143	Gremlins is still the best.
5502163	5504726	Actually, poor Bruce Willis with Bruce Willis' health.
5504926	5508150	I think there's going to be a big resurgence in people watching Die Hard.
5508290	5513956	So I guess I should shut my mouth and move on for a change and move on to the next story.
5514797	5517400	Loki with one more story for us before we get to the Listener Roundtable.
5518460	5523327	I mean, it's always fun to do those post-mortems and be like, what went wrong?
5523908	5538549	And, you know, for those who don't remember Mind's Eye, Build a Rocket Boy, you know, over 250 developers were laid off from the studio recently following the disastrous launch of the game.
5539270	5547522	And of that, of course, the devs have been blasting the former...
5547502	5550229	CEO or their former CEO.
5550309	5558609	So Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies said that there is poor working conditions and chaotic layoffs.
5559170	5564683	This is the arrogance of leadership to believe that they can actually act with impunity throughout the
5564663	5573338	and following redundancies has pushed myself and many former continuing employees to take a stand.
5574419	5585558	They wrote a statement to their leadership talking about basically saying we stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build A Rocket.
5585538	5596569	as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter condemning the way at which they've been mistreated and discarded by the studio's millionaire executives.
5596589	5600633	I mean, yeah, I mean, of course it's going to be the higher-ups that are screwing that game over.
5600653	5602555	I mean, I don't know.
5604297	5609302	I'm sure we're going to hear a lot more about this, especially if there is a lawsuit that ends up going forward.
5609322	5612946	But, um, yeah.
5615542	5622578	Alright, boy, this game sure didn't end up being worth it for all the drama surrounding it.
5624302	5628713	I don't want to make light of this shitty situation for all the developers that were working their ass off on it.
5628993	5631880	It's really unfortunate how that all turned out.
5632518	5633219	All right.
5633239	5635263	Well, we're going to go to the listener roundtable next.
5635604	5640433	And you guys can always send us social media posts over at Blue Sky.
5640513	5641655	And you can also send us emails.
5641755	5645001	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.
5645783	5651293	With the announcement last week, I think some folks have been sending in some emails to pay respects.
5651433	5654299	Push F and some other keys.
5654760	5656062	So let's get to it, DarkSakura.
5656835	5657637	We have one email.
5659741	5663048	Hello, this is Jessie, aka Illegally Cited.
5663068	5665893	I haven't written in very often, but I've been listening for years and years.
5666094	5670302	I remember listening to this show in early 2000s and liking the chemistry of the group.
5670322	5673509	I wasn't really into dance games, though, so I took a short break from the podcast.
5673529	5675152	Since then, though, I've been listening ever since.
5675272	5675954	God, I feel old.
5676956	5677577	Me too.
5678333	5682280	I have to admit, it was very surprising to hear this show will be ending after so many years.
5682741	5685565	I knew it would eventually, but it's still surprising when it does.
5685585	5692057	I can definitely relate to why you want to quit with all the hate and negativity, not to mention greed of the industry.
5692738	5699329	I've been running a YouTube channel that focuses on technology game and XR accessibility since 2012.
5699309	5699550	.
5699570	5699850	.
5699870	5715445	.
5715425	5723100	I think the indies and smaller games are where the industry is the strongest and that's where I've been putting most of my focus in games the past several years.
5723120	5728210	If people are only paying attention to the big budget sequels and remakes things definitely seem a little stale.
5728331	5734142	I can count how many amazing smaller games are coming out these days and so many I can't keep up with them all.
5734122	5739328	Sorry for such a long email, but I figured I had to write in one more time before this version of the show ends.
5739749	5743413	If you ever want a guest or is curious about game accessibility, please reach out.
5743433	5744294	I would love to chat.
5744895	5747438	It's one of the most positive areas in gaming right now.
5747518	5749660	Congratulations on so many years of the show.
5749680	5757249	It will definitely be weird not having a new episode every week, even though I'm one of the archived listeners.
5757269	5758911	Jesse.
5760333	5761254	Who said anything about quitting?
5763016	5763657	Well...
5763890	5764791	I'm doing something else.
5765412	5768115	I'm going to keep going, just not with OLR.
5768295	5780711	Which is great for those that are looking for something to continue to listen to and support, because of course you and all your co-conspirators and whatever your new adventure is will need the support, right?
5780791	5782673	So I think that'd be great.
5782733	5784075	And Bobby Blackwolf?
5784055	5808409	Thank you so much.
5808541	5812265	Whatever we can do to support you getting your voice out there.
5812285	5815169	Because I think it's very nice you want to come on the show and talk about it.
5815189	5817632	It might be a little difficult with only so many episodes remaining.
5818112	5821776	But what can we do to help empower you to get your voice out there?
5821817	5825000	It sounds like you have a YouTube that you're running.
5826202	5827243	Make sure we have the name.
5827343	5830246	I don't know if it's just under illegally cited as well or something else.
5830707	5833350	But what...
5833330	5838799	I'm actually looking at a Blue Sky post I was going to read here that says, it's from Blue Swim.
5839440	5841623	I recognize that name from some time ago.
5841684	5846451	It says, the podcast that made me want to become a podcaster is ending next month after 23 years.
5846531	5849977	Congratulations to Jamie, Rob, and Matt on a hell of a run.
5849997	5850778	Thank you very much for that.
5850818	5851580	I appreciate that.
5851600	5853823	And that really is like the biggest compliment.
5853843	5859152	I think any of us, you know, I don't want to speak for Jamie and Matt, but I know for me, when I hear somebody else saying,
5859132	5862121	I started a podcast because I heard you guys and I wanted to do one.
5862262	5865191	There is no better compliment in my opinion.
5867218	5869284	Look at all the time that we're inspiring people.
5869625	5871471	Yeah.
5872075	5873277	Yeah, I love it.
5873297	5877285	And it really makes me feel good about what we did.
5877806	5881894	Because sometimes, you know, let's be honest.
5881914	5883217	I'm looking at Twitch right now.
5883738	5888086	There's 31 people watching, which is a little higher than it usually is, to be quite honest.
5888147	5890431	And it's not about quantity.
5891132	5892936	But sometimes it is a little...
5893068	5910452	Thank you for watching.
5910432	5939427	Thank you for watching!
5940419	5943032	Yeah, Rinmari says, I never really noticed the viewer count.
5943112	5946227	And trust me, Mari, if I made decisions based off a viewer count...
5947675	5948516	But it's okay.
5948536	5950198	Viewer counts aren't really accurate anyway.
5950398	5953301	And it doesn't have to be that.
5953982	5957646	I look at it as a small congregation, a strip mall church.
5957746	5962952	I don't want to sound sacrilegious, but a strip mall church usually has 20 people to go on Sunday nights.
5962972	5967276	But that's enough of a fam to give them community to keep them going.
5967296	5970039	And that's how I feel about it.
5970160	5977007	It's still enough of a strong community to keep things going and to keep it as long as it has.
5976987	5985420	I saw a TikTok from a drag performer friend of mine this week, and I was like, this is extremely on the nose.
5985460	5987884	And this is speaking for myself.
5987904	5993753	This drag performer in the TikTok said that they were speaking with a friend or a therapist or something like that.
5993773	5999923	And that individual said, when was the last time you took a day off from work?
6000157	6013874	and the performer said, oh, I don't know, maybe a few months ago when I went on vacation or I took a day off on Friday and that person said, no, when was the last time you took a day off from work?
6013894	6022204	Because you do your day job, you go do something on Saturday, you go do something on Sunday, you are always working every day.
6022224	6024006	When was the last time you took a day off?
6024026	6028932	And I literally saw this TikTok and this individual post this last week and I was like,
6029249	6039434	This, I feel this, you know, and again, that's for me personally, is that I think now is just a good time for me to have a day off.
6041338	6043042	So, all right.
6045147	6047072	I want to read some other posts.
6048824	6054071	Um, there's some kind words about the show.
6054491	6063724	I saw one here from James B. Jones over on Blue Sky that said Orange Launch Radio, quite literally a generational podcast that I listened to for years.
6064084	6067068	That's the first time I've heard this show described as generational.
6067569	6072135	But I guess 23 years does encompass more than one generation, doesn't it?
6072155	6074798	I was like, dang, when I heard that.
6074778	6076702	Oh, is that who that is, Bobby?
6076842	6080248	I couldn't place the name and I didn't recognize the photo.
6080268	6083134	Bobby says that's Maximus Panicus from the All Games days.
6083334	6084136	That's amazing.
6084216	6085959	Okay, now I get it.
6086239	6088965	I admit to falling off over the past few years.
6088985	6094575	For my mental health, I stopped consuming most gaming media when I moved into development.
6094555	6097500	That statement really struck me as well.
6097520	6101668	Because my immediate gut reaction was like, oh, I get it.
6102068	6105374	Yeah, if I worked in games, I'd have to cut out all that stuff too.
6105735	6109341	And then I kind of took a step back and went, that's really sad.
6110367	6117920	That's really sad that when you're in the industry, it's difficult to listen to these sorts of podcasts.
6118301	6121967	And I don't take that personally, even though I like to think we're a little more positive.
6122047	6124832	And I do realize sometimes we do have our criticisms.
6125553	6129340	And I also go, I understand the need to cut it cold turkey.
6129380	6131383	It doesn't matter if we're the nice one.
6131403	6132365	You got to cut it cold turkey.
6133046	6134308	That comment really made me think.
6134348	6136071	I was like, damn.
6136051	6141162	There's got to be a lot of folks that are in the industry that can't consume this kind of stuff.
6141203	6142225	It's too hard to listen to.
6142806	6144550	That's really sad.
6144670	6149321	And then finishes out the statement saying, but for years, this program was a weekly staple.
6149381	6152608	Well, thank you so much for that and really appreciate the sentiment there.
6154107	6161182	I've been asked several times if we're going to take calls on the last show or people that are planning to call in on the last show.
6161763	6165731	I think in the spirit of what OLR is all about, we need to.
6166393	6169098	So yes, that will be a thing we do.
6169118	6173668	But please prepare yourself that the lightning round clock will be on.
6173648	6179337	So you're going to have to keep yourself succinct just because we want to allow all the people.
6179357	6183042	For those that can't be here live, will we do something where you can submit a recording?
6183603	6188330	Yes, I will work on something in the coming weeks where you could submit something prerecorded.
6188651	6191195	I want to try to make it easier than send an MP3.
6191335	6195000	I think there's some services where you could just record a voicemail with your mic and send it.
6195501	6198486	And I'd like to be able to do that for folks who are interested in that.
6199187	6201310	But more details to come.
6201290	6205738	and we will play those either on the last show or the show before.
6206339	6209204	I'm going to be taking the next day off.
6210125	6211628	Of work?
6211648	6214192	Yeah, I'm absolutely going to be taking the next day off.
6214873	6216396	That's Thanksgiving week, right?
6217490	6245455	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6245435	6250002	Yeah, SJ100Matt says we can make a Discord thread where folks can drop recordings and stuff, right?
6250022	6250883	Yeah, we could.
6251484	6253447	I feel like I want to find an even easier way.
6253547	6258054	I know there's websites that just like literally you just on your phone, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and send the message.
6258675	6261359	So we'll figure that out.
6261379	6263562	I'll figure it out and get back to y'all.
6263542	6268328	So, with that, but of course, emails are great, too.
6268668	6270711	Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6270871	6272333	We'd love to hear from folks.
6274215	6274876	Last-minute stories.
6274936	6277199	Loki, anything tonight?
6277219	6285870	I don't have anything, but I did want to mention, even though it's not this coming week, but the next week, the new Katamari game comes out.
6288567	6290890	Hey, counter-programming for Pokemon.
6291891	6292351	Just kidding.
6293253	6294174	There can be room for both.
6294794	6296717	Okay.
6297117	6299720	Well, with that, usually I have a spiel here.
6300421	6307770	I think I'm going to be changing that here and just say that we just want to say thank you to everybody for your support over the years of this program.
6308350	6313056	This 1065 and counting episode legacy is thanks to all of you.
6313036	6316080	and your support and being here for the show.
6316160	6317141	We really appreciate it.
6317702	6325512	And this last little final stretch here is really for you all and dedicated to all of you that kept OLR going over the years.
6325532	6333061	We appreciate you and we hope you'll have a lot of fun here throughout the rest of this month and next as we wrap it up.
6333081	6337347	But we do have more to say and a lot can change in the gaming industry in a couple weeks.
6337727	6341372	So we hope you'll still be here with us until the very bitter end.
6341352	6343876	With that, we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.
6344657	6346941	DarkSakura, streaming tonight?
6347341	6347742	Straman?
6347922	6349364	Yes, I am.
6349484	6354011	But I just had to turn off my emotions or else I would be overwhelmed.
6354031	6354993	Sure, I understand.
6355414	6357116	But do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
6357757	6358679	I'm going to TwitchCon.
6359380	6369435	So if any of y'all are at TwitchCon or in San Diego or at Disneyland on that Monday and you see me...
6369905	6370646	Come say hi.
6371387	6372089	We'll hang out.
6372349	6376716	We'll get some desserts and maybe a pretzel.
6377998	6378660	All right.
6378680	6379140	I love it.
6379321	6379841	Have fun.
6380523	6388856	Have a ton of fun at TwitchCon and we'll miss you next week, but I'm excited for you to be getting to do some networking and see people, IRL and all that good stuff.
6388917	6390359	Have a blast.
6390379	6393945	I'm going for the hangouts this time and maybe a little bit of work.
6394225	6394426	Okay.
6395447	6395527	Bye.
6395548	6395908	Bye.
6395948	6396469	Have fun.
6397141	6398586	Loki, then we're over to you.
6398626	6399751	What's your final thought for tonight?
6401377	6401999	I don't know.
6402059	6403243	Keep working on Minecraft stuff.
6403846	6405391	Don't really have anything else to add.
6405411	6406475	Maybe I'll play some different games.
6406556	6407218	Probably not.
6408532	6414799	My final thought for tonight is Pokemon Legends, my favorite Pokemon series because I loved the last game that much.
6415299	6416501	Very excited to play the new one.
6416561	6417442	Please don't let me down.
6417902	6419804	But I haven't been buying into the hype.
6420124	6421326	I'm really excited about it.
6422267	6423248	Have a great week, everybody.
6423268	6427372	We'll see you next time on the 19th to talk about whatever might come out of TwitchCon.
6427993	6430516	Maybe we'll hear from DarkSakura remotely.
6430536	6435100	I don't want to promise that, but we can certainly make it available to them if they're able to call in or something.
6435120	6437543	And all of you about the weekend news.
6437523	6459497	have a great week everybody, we'll see you next week, bye bye
6460844	6470508	But you know they were all still true.
6473295	6474718	See you next week.
