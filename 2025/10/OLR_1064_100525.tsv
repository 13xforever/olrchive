9835	17163	If I had taken that economics class in high school, I might be able to understand how to compare sales like a single game in contrast to subscription services like Game Pass.
17443	27815	Microsoft reportedly lost $300 million in sales putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass Day 1, which, duh, anyone that wants to be in the Microsoft ecosystem and has already subscribed to Game Pass gets to play it at no additional cost.
27835	29336	I'm shrugging furiously right now.
29557	35022	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about Microsoft's headlines and the rest of the week's gaming news.
35043	37345	Starting right now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice...
39012	45499	Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45659	53767	It's Orange Lounge Radio Live, again, again, again, episode number 1064 for tonight, October the 5th of 2025.
54388	60153	We're here to talk about video game news, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and once in a while, a really good new recipe.
60534	65078	With myself, Rob Roberts, and your co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66019	68682	The only recipes I hear of is a recipe for disaster.
70180	97352	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
97602	98969	It's Mega Bonk.
99311	99934	Mega Bonk.
99974	102769	Nothing to do with Bonk from the TurboGrafx era.
103559	104741	No, nothing to do with that.
104901	107705	So there is a funny story about this.
107725	115537	So there is a guy who I watch on YouTube named Danny, who is a game developer in Unity.
115557	118642	He had one game that he was trying to push for a while called Carlson.
118962	122969	He also made some free-to-play games.
123029	126634	I want to say Crab Game was one that was really popular for a while.
126654	127856	It was like a Squid Game type thing.
128657	132503	And he's disappeared off the face of the earth for the longest time.
132702	140318	Ironically, this game comes out and, you know, it does really well and it's sort of similar to his style.
140939	145048	And wouldn't you know it, the developer's name is his name backwards.
145068	147673	So I'm guessing it's the same person.
149155	151159	because that would be quite the coincidence.
151279	151940	Interesting.
152081	152842	Interesting.
152862	153223	All right.
153323	155327	Have you played this game or are you just hearing the hype about it?
155567	159154	I have purchased this game and have not played this game yet.
159234	160857	Oh, the Steam backlog issue.
160957	161498	Yes, yes.
161538	162480	I'm familiar with that one.
162660	163422	Yes.
163442	164003	It's an issue.
164063	165105	It's a feature.
165524	171269	Going to our chat because we do tape live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 p.m.
171329	175533	Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show on Sunday nights.
175593	177415	And you can listen along live with us.
177435	184101	And Dark Tetsuya, in reference to what I was talking about with Bonk, suggesting another IP Konami's just sitting on.
184581	193970	Yeah, but I mean, I do feel like I haven't played it myself yet, but just judging from other people, it seems like Silent Hill F is a win.
194010	195531	It's a win in Konami's column.
195511	198657	in a series of what's been honestly good.
198797	202965	You said it was really good?
202985	213064	I've been watching people play it and I won't be able to until it's on GeForce Experience or if I know it works with Crossover, but from what I've seen, it's
213888	237685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
237665	262778	well done uh the Castlevania repackages the Metal Gear thing is probably going to be really good too Suikoden coming back and the HD collection is really good um on the arcade front you know round one is is the place to be and a lot of that is because of you know granted not just Konami music games but if but a a series that Konami definitely pioneered and is still a major player in you know so uh
262758	264580	You gotta give credit to Konami.
264600	267364	We're in a Konami Renaissance era, and it's great.
267484	269127	So, you know, kudos to them.
269147	273713	I'm excited to see what's next, especially with, you know, Metal Gear and so forth.
273733	276056	Yeah, QuestBuster and Chad agree, it's a huge win for Konami.
276336	288833	The few horror streamers I managed to catch have loved Silent Hill F. And yeah, I feel like, you know, as much as we're joking about, gosh, it's frustrating that they won't release a new bonk, well, maybe the good news is, if they ever do a new bonk,
288813	291497	It's got a better chance of being good than not so good.
291537	302495	The people that be and the powers that be at Konami that are making the decisions now in the 2020s seem to be in a lot better sound place than 10 years ago, 20 years ago even.
303076	304698	So it's good news.
304839	305620	Good news for Konami.
305640	307583	I'm excited to pick up Silent Hill F at some point.
308164	308925	I probably will.
309005	311710	I just picked up a couple other games first.
311730	315175	So we're in that part of the year where you have to pick and choose what games you play.
315155	320121	Um, just like you have to pick and choose what games you play, you have to pick and choose what consoles you play them on.
320962	330153	And Loki, uh, gonna start us off with a headline, a series of headlines, really, that has the entire gaming industry talking this week.
330173	331435	Um, take it away, please.
332516	340386	Oh boy, yes, uh, because, you know, Microsoft clearly reading the room of the economy and how everything's kinda...
340535	341696	Going to the shitter.
341916	345701	They're like, hey, you know what would be a good thing to do about this time?
345721	347142	Let's raise some more prices.
347723	348864	And so they did that.
348944	352868	They raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50%.
352988	356392	So it went from $20 a month to $30.
356492	358034	But hey, don't worry.
358054	369546	You're going to get some extra features that you may or may not want, including some Ubisoft back catalog games and Fortnite Game Passes or something.
370387	372970	Cool, I guess.
374191	375453	But yeah, so they did all that.
375493	379618	They also added streaming, though, to some of the lower tiers as well.
379738	384103	But for most people, it's like, nope, sorry.
384123	386626	$360 a year for Game Pass?
387147	387547	I'm out.
389169	390050	And I was one of those people.
390070	393975	I don't really play Game Pass enough as is.
393995	400022	I kind of just let it go month to month, and maybe my son will play stuff off of it.
400222	404328	At this point, $30 a month is not something I can just let idly sit there.
404669	407072	Especially with all of their games right now.
407573	412540	Mostly, I would be picking those up on PC if I'm going to play anything.
412560	420251	And on top of that, really the only thing I'm holding onto on my Xbox Series X right now is Grand Theft Auto 6.
420732	422675	Only because it's not on PC at launch.
422795	426040	Otherwise, if it was on PC at launch, I'd get it on PC.
426661	427562	But...
427863	431811	Yeah, I think it's just, it's really annoying that they're doing that.
431831	444657	Not to mention that on top of all that, they kind of made these assertions back, you know, when this whole, you know, the FTC was looking into them stuff and, you know, we were like, all those, that FTC, what are they doing and stuff, you know, but like...
445902	466408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
466388	477673	So, for example, Call of Duty Points, which were for cosmetics in the Call of Duty series, they are now no longer getting that discount that you used to have.
477914	482203	Also, they're changing the way that discounts work on other...
483179	508663	Game Passes Game Passes
508643	528711	Call of Duty Black Ops 6
529788	554530	and so that lost revenue which I mean like let's hold the phone here for a second so yeah it's lost revenue in the sense that you didn't sell your $80 game or whatever but at the same time you're really whoring those Microsoft points and the Call of Duty points and whatever other points I would also how many of those downloads were people that were actually going to buy the game
554577	556441	Yeah, exactly.
557523	562634	Right.
564157	566883	So I think that there's some of that stuff.
566943	570190	Yeah, you may have lost on some of the sales, but
571081	576691	Is it really a loss in the end if you're making that stuff up in the microtransactions and all that type of stuff?
577112	581419	So I don't know if that's a fair comparison, but whatever.
581940	589393	And then along with this, being this backlash is so big and the fact that these consoles are getting so expensive.
589373	591697	and that retailers are stopping.
591757	595843	Some retailers are not carrying the Xbox consoles anymore.
596364	604156	Apparently, next-gen Xbox plans might be up in the air if more retailers are not selling the consoles.
604857	615373	And it might be something for Microsoft to think about that they may just transition into a third-party game publisher instead and not put out their own consoles.
615974	617997	Or maybe they do put their consoles out and...
617977	642533	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
642513	642914	Yeah.
643514	649302	To backtrack a little bit over the large amount of news you just dropped there, you know, about the price going up to $30.
649782	655549	I mean, this just shows a poor lack of planning on Microsoft's part.
655950	656971	It's quite frankly what it is.
657171	664681	You know, from a consumer perspective, the choice to give away games on Game Pass day one, from a consumer perspective, was great.
665101	667665	And I'm sure really drove a lot of signups for Game Pass.
668586	669567	But from a business perspective,
669547	690964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
690944	704406	I truly believe that if there had been a little more foresight and a little better planning in this regard, now granted, Microsoft could never have foresaw this tariff, well, they maybe could have a little bit, but I'm going to give them a pass, okay?
705067	712058	Like, none of us were prepared for the speed and, you know, at which all this bullshit's taking place right now.
712038	714342	and so forth.
714683	726724	I'm not even considering any of that other stuff and what I'm saying, but the increased price of the consoles does play into the whole the truth is in the perception.
727265	728427	I think that
728407	754060	I, I, I,
754040	757004	You know, otherwise, they couldn't have the foresight for that.
757064	760389	But the Game Pass thing, I feel like they could have had the foresight for.
760910	769343	And what they really should have done, and y'all are going to hate me for saying this, but this would have been a better way to get the Band-Aid off than what they're doing now.
769363	776353	And yes, I know most of you would prefer that the Band-Aid just get ripped right off, but in most cases, it isn't always the best business plan.
776373	781060	Case in point, what we're hearing about the cancellations shutting down the website, it's so many of them.
781040	785007	Just like what happened with Disney Plus over a completely different situation.
786289	796106	What Microsoft could have done was six months ago announce, this was an experimental plan for us to deliver the day one games on Game Pass.
796507	799572	We are going to be scaling that back from the service this holiday.
799552	819045	instead, please look forward to these other types of incentives, blah, blah, blah, blah or maybe try to sweeten the pot at that point with the Fortnite Battle Pass or what I think ought to be a WoW subscription, but I'm a niche gamer, fine, but maybe Blizzard Credit of other sort, you know, Blizzard Bucks or whatever they want to do, you know, sweeten the pot that way, and then
819025	828118	6 months later say, now we're coming out with a brand new tier of Game Pass that's Game Pass Ultra Femininominon.
828138	835269	It's the Game Pass Femininominon tier that comes out with all the extra stuff in it and the day one and stuff.
835309	838353	And it's something that you can get for this hot new deal right now.
838474	847547	I feel like what we're seeing now is more reactionary to what was bad business planning than what could have been a better business strategy from the beginning.
847527	870683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
870663	897058	I felt that there was a lot of good stuff that a couple years ago Phil Spencer was doing ever since this Microsoft acquisition I feel like it's been botched decision after botched decision I don't see how he stays at the top of the company much longer especially after if these Game Pass subscriptions keep falling the way they are I'm sorry as a person to say that I don't take delight in it but at the same time
897038	904517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
905594	910701	This is bad business on Microsoft.
910721	911743	That's what it is.
911763	914246	You can put excuses.
914266	917471	You can put justifications, I guess, if you're still in Microsoft.
917751	921777	You can say, well, they have to squeeze every last drop of juice out of their existing consumer.
922678	927085	I can sit here and say, no matter what way you slice it, it's bad business.
927485	935196	And Microsoft is not in a position in the gaming space to be able to get away with making many more bad decisions, if any at all.
935800	937021	And that's that.
937041	939384	I think this decision is going to harm Microsoft.
939684	962428	And I think this, coupled with the tariff thing, is ironically going to send a somewhat more American-based company out of the gaming space and make way for its competitors in a foreign country, which is the exact opposite of what our Fuhrer-in-Chief thought he was going to be doing with these tariffs.
964530	965571	What do you mean, think?
968116	971339	Which part?
971359	974362	I don't think that there's a functional brain left.
974402	974623	Oh, no, no.
974643	975584	There's clearly not.
975604	976384	Well, especially now.
976525	981449	I mean, did you see that bro-level military address?
981610	987636	I have mercifully been gone all weekend, and the only thing I listened to, because I drove to L.A.
987676	992841	and back by myself, and the only thing I had to pass the time was, oh...
992821	995143	There's audiobooks available.
995483	1001329	Oh, there's a certain new audiobook from a person I wish would be the president right now that is out.
1001449	1004191	I'm going to listen to this for the next nine hours.
1004211	1005593	And it was pleasant.
1005613	1008155	Let me tell you, it was embarrassing.
1008215	1010597	Yeah, E3VL says it right.
1010637	1011938	No one clapped at the end.
1012159	1013260	It was dead silence.
1015081	1016122	Everybody hated that.
1016142	1017043	No cheering from the press box.
1017103	1018044	Everybody disliked that.
1018064	1019545	Everybody disliked that.
1019565	1020246	Yeah.
1021103	1023946	There was literally nothing.
1024607	1025127	Nothing.
1025147	1027510	It was dead silent.
1027530	1031974	So, I mean, and you can say, keep politics out of gaming.
1032034	1034617	Keep your politics out of my gaming show.
1034677	1039121	Keep your politics out of... It hasn't stopped politics from getting into our gaming.
1039141	1040162	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
1040783	1041384	You're the winner.
1041424	1042325	You get a prize.
1042345	1042825	That's it.
1043085	1043566	That's it.
1044046	1046689	And Microsoft is...
1046669	1058648	As reported by industry media, Microsoft is about to be pushed out of the retail space.
1060311	1062494	And what do we have to thank for that?
1062514	1067081	Bad business decisions and decisions where their hand was forced out of their control.
1067722	1069806	Back to back.
1069826	1071889	That's it.
1071909	1073892	You can't keep politics out of gaming.
1075154	1082024	Sorry to some of you that it took this long to figure that out.
1082044	1083926	Anyway.
1084106	1084968	Loki, what did I miss?
1086470	1087752	Jamie, anything you want to add?
1092018	1095582	I'm just... I feel sick to my stomach.
1097265	1098226	Over the whole thing.
1098246	1099368	I just feel sick to my stomach.
1101651	1103153	A lot has been...
1103723	1112142	A lot has been just really... I can't even... I don't even know what the even that I can't do is.
1112162	1114447	It's that bad.
1114467	1115509	But thank God I have a Mac.
1117072	1123707	Well, I understand that perspective, but also, like, you know, there's...
1123855	1129905	A lot of Microsoft stuff is going to take a while to show up there too You don't bother with Game Pass on Mac, right?
1130526	1138038	Hell no Do I really want to play games at the lowest quality possible on my Mac Studio?
1139661	1149897	Excuse me, I can run all this stuff by enabling some of my extra metal capabilities Running it through Crossover and have it look freaking perfect Or play it through GeForce
1151058	1158609	I mean, oh, and I guess I never said where I'm at personally with my own thing because I've been an Xbox gold or whatever the fuck they've called it over the years.
1158750	1160312	I've been at that level of Xbox.
1160372	1163116	I think I have a 20-year badge, 19-year, 20-year badge.
1163136	1165159	I have a 20-year badge, I'm pretty sure, on my account.
1165179	1172250	Like, I got into Xbox in part because of this show and in part to a wedding I went to where they played Halo.
1172270	1174333	And I loved Halo so much I bought an Xbox.
1174594	1178179	And I got on Xbox Live because I wanted the DLC for DDR Ultramix.
1178159	1180424	That was what got me into Xbox and Xbox Live.
1180664	1183490	And I have carried it consistently this entire time.
1183510	1186577	And this is now where I'm sitting going, is this the end?
1186597	1187980	I think this might be the end.
1188000	1198682	And to credit to what Bobby was saying earlier in chat, it was a while ago in chat, but Bobby had suggested for Loki just get Essential when Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out if you want to play it online.
1198780	1200043	Right, exactly.
1201426	1203691	So there is a part of me that's like, do I downgrade?
1204112	1210326	But I'm also kind of at this point where I'm like, honestly, maybe I'll just buy Forza Horizon on PlayStation.
1211572	1220869	and I think maybe I'm just going to cut Microsoft loose so I'm only paying one of these fees because I'm doing most of my gaming on PC these days.
1220889	1233833	I play a little bit on the Switch and I play a little bit on PlayStation and I know we have our Xbox fans in the house and I hope you hear me when I say I'm not being an Xbox hater but I feel like Microsoft's forcing me to make a choice.
1234606	1237510	and I'm kind of at this... To you in particular.
1238031	1241896	They said, we know that Rob guy is playing all of our stuff.
1242497	1246542	So we're gonna... We're doing all this because of Rob, really.
1246562	1247423	Yeah, no, it's fair.
1248985	1253672	No one could have predicted shooting yourself in the foot this hard, though, to be fair.
1255294	1263685	Well... Well... I guess you could say the government did in the whole thing, but...
1264373	1293132	I think there's a whole other argument there about what needed to be eliminated from the gaming industry the saddest part of that whole thing was that Bobby Kotek got a golden parachute getting separated from and that's the most fucked up thing about capitalism in America that these executives walk away with millions and you walk away with bigger bills there's gonna come a time where people are finally gonna figure it out
1293230	1294692	and they're not going to take it anymore.
1296034	1303504	It's funny, I was actually telling Dan that just earlier today in general about stuff and then we started going, can you hear the people sing?
1304746	1313918	It's just, we have to rely, there will come a time, there will come a time when people think for themselves instead of reading it online.
1314999	1316041	Grok told me this.
1317042	1320587	Do you remember when we went to see Greg Proops?
1321107	1322489	Oh yeah, that was a fun show.
1322689	1323290	He's a great guy.
1323330	1325052	Do you remember what my question to him was?
1325473	1327795	Absolutely not after all these years, but I'm sure you do.
1327856	1338008	How far away are we from an American cover of the French Revolution?
1338028	1339410	And he was like, oh, it's going to happen.
1340512	1342474	And then he signed my paper and said it was cool.
1342910	1344032	You should find that episode.
1344052	1344934	He gave me his note sheet.
1345174	1346116	I have it as framed.
1346236	1348881	I was going to say, well, I'm sure the episode you have somewhere.
1348921	1350625	Oh yeah, the episode.
1350645	1351587	We'll have to find it.
1351667	1353711	I don't know if he still podcasts.
1354091	1355975	He had a pretty successful show for a long time.
1356416	1364952	If Greg still podcasts, you should email him and say, hey, I just wanted to revisit this question.
1364932	1369698	I'm just circling back per my last email.
1370359	1374144	I'm going to have to see if the Smartest Man in the World podcast is still going.
1374164	1374905	Yeah, yeah.
1374925	1375225	Anyway.
1375946	1378870	I learned so much about baseball from him.
1381273	1381733	All right.
1383095	1384276	Let's move on.
1384336	1386279	Let's talk about happy things like your gaming week.
1386299	1387080	How was your gaming week?
1387340	1388762	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1389755	1394163	Um, I played, uh, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1395645	1397569	Um, oh yeah, the last episode was in 2010.
1397709	1398951	I just found out.
1399673	1400234	Aw, that's a bummer.
1400454	1400735	Anyway.
1401816	1404962	Um, so, uh, I, uh...
1405583	1407467	Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight.
1408950	1414703	I'm actually trying to do the DBD Day challenges to get all the goodies and whatnot.
1415545	1422259	And Shay and I were playing Survivor and we met two people who were really lovely and were trying to adapt their jills.
1422661	1424084	So they were doing Adepts together.
1424745	1432279	So we helped them get their Jill Adept, and then we played with them until we got them their Leon, Chris, Carlos Adept.
1432299	1435285	And then Shay went on to play with them, and they got a few more.
1436347	1439052	But I like doing stuff like that, helping people out.
1440074	1442659	And I played some Killer.
1442859	1445344	That was fun, kind of.
1446337	1448460	I've played more of Avatar.
1448500	1454949	I'm doing The Secret of the Spires, which is, to me, a lot more fun than the last DLC.
1455009	1460556	So I want to get that finished before a certain movie comes out.
1462259	1464381	And played some Palia.
1465082	1470690	I finally have bought yet another property, and I'm now trying to save up enough money to put stuff on it.
1471025	1497690	um um played some Suica game uh some Bellatro um oh yeah and uh uh Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight or Symphony of the Night for Saturn played a good bit of that got to the Reverse Castle good times all right Loki we'll go to you how was your gaming week
1497940	1526412	I just played Minecraft stuff so we had a there was CubeCon this weekend which is an in-game Minecraft convention so went and explored that for a bit it's still going to be up for the next week if you haven't gotten a chance to check it out or want to you can do that our SMP has a booth there as well and there's like mini games and stuff I don't know so we did that and we're just working on stuff in-game as well put out a video
1526695	1531069	I'm setting up a build contest right now and yeah, that's pretty much it.
1531994	1558069	awesome um my gaming week was interesting um i'm still continuing my adventures in final fantasy 11 i finally hit uh level 50 which means i need to do my limit break but i'm playing on that server that has the the xp gains out the wazoo so there's that i've also been playing the very aptly timed uh re-release remaster of final fantasy tactics i played a little bit of that on playstation this week before i went out of town this weekend and um
1558049	1585120	you know it's it's you can choose if you want to play the remake version or the original version um if you just want to play basically the the ps1 obviously i went for the newer one to just kind of check out the voice acting which of course is well done and just some of the you know other changes they've made to it such as um uh kind of the way you'd like i was instinctively trying to hit l1 and r1 to rotate the board but that's not how it works anymore you use the other set or if maybe i was wrong maybe my muscle memory failed me which is completely possible
1585100	1589205	But you use the other stick and now there's like a tactical view you can use, which is kind of neat.
1589566	1591088	So yeah, I've been enjoying it.
1591228	1600260	I'm not usually into tactical games, but for some reason I always have given Final Fantasy Tactics a pass, probably just because I'm a Final Fantasy fan at heart.
1600280	1609993	And I am working on the thing that many of you do, which is grinding that first area over and over and over again to get up my job levels until I have to take on the actual story quests.
1609973	1627071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1627051	1630617	I ended up going to Knott's Berry Farm, which I have never been to before.
1630637	1635566	And it was completely on a whim, thanks to an internet friend of mine who was like, hey, I have extra tickets.
1635606	1636287	Do you want to go?
1636648	1638952	And we were like, fuck yeah, let's go to Knott's Berry Farm.
1639393	1641236	We did not get to go to Knott's Scary Farm.
1641616	1643159	That was a different thing in the evening, sadly.
1643560	1646926	I've never been to the park outside of the restaurant.
1646986	1647707	So that was cute.
1647867	1648789	It was cute.
1648769	1669579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1669559	1692377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1692357	1699831	So we actually went and we did the Fallout maze, which is based on the Amazon TV show, I think a little more than the games.
1699851	1702556	But I definitely got I haven't seen the TV show yet.
1702576	1703738	But of course, I've seen the game.
1704199	1715260	I played the games at least a little bit well enough to recognize like, oh, the same little mascots that you see in the game are in the little queue as you're in the thing that the haunted house itself.
1715982	1734075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1734055	1735377	and are working.
1735397	1740445	But at the end of the day, it's still a black light maze where people are trying to jump out of the corner and say, boo.
1740765	1749899	But because so many people are moving through it so quickly, if you just look ahead of you, you can see where all the people are jumping out trying to scare people.
1749919	1751902	And so I was just kind of like, okay.
1751922	1756448	And I was having a funny observation with my pal Victoria coming out of there.
1756468	1762898	I was like, it's something about the year 2025 where I think people just are like, you know what?
1762878	1763519	Kill me.
1763539	1764521	Do it quick.
1764541	1764981	Do it.
1765001	1765683	Just off me.
1765803	1766263	End it all.
1766664	1767265	I don't care.
1767646	1779064	That's really taking the fun out of this stuff because we were in an area, so we did the tram tour, and you'd end up doing this little walkthrough that's like scenes from Megan.
1779084	1780206	It's all the Blumhouse films.
1780486	1782169	So The Purge was one of them.
1782149	1808697	and there were those big there were those big clowns on stilts and one of them comes up to me goes rah you know trying to scare me and I'm just like you know what I literally I did this and I'm not even trying to be an edgelord or anything I just like literally just my knee-jerk Daria reaction was you know what just do it quick Trump's America couldn't be me like that literally was what I said I'm not even embellishing I literally looked this guy dead in the eye did it and do you know what his response was hmm
1809689	1814094	Hey, that's my territory.
1814654	1818438	I know, it's just funny to me.
1818478	1823624	Yeah.
1823804	1837519	Yeah.
1837955	1865380	so the fallout thing and you know I usually and it's again I get scared pretty easy and I don't like jump scares but because I could look ahead like I could see where all the scares were and there was this guy that came rushing and I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep it real he was an attractive killer he was it was like like the guys that play Norman Bates at Universal he was an attractive killer and he came rushing at me with a pipe and I just gave him a look like this
1866895	1875011	Like I just looked at him like, you know, kind of like, and sorry podcast folks, but I'm giving a look of like, okay, like I'm just looking, I'm like, okay, do it.
1875332	1879621	It's the upper pointed side eye.
1879761	1885613	His response is, as he got to me, he just saluted, he gave me a little two finger salute and walked back.
1887382	1889466	It was almost funny to me.
1889526	1890428	I feel bad.
1890448	1895777	I should probably just play along and act scared and that whole thing.
1895817	1904814	I had a good time, but I also was three very expensive beverages in by the time we got to the Fallout maze.
1904834	1906757	And I was just like, I don't...
1907227	1911131	Everything is just kind of... Everything just exists right now.
1911331	1915855	I am but a mere projection onto this plane of existence.
1915875	1918277	And I just, you know, I'm just making my way through a maze.
1918537	1919878	Making my way downtown.
1919898	1921840	Disassociating your way through life.
1921920	1922501	Pretty much.
1923101	1924402	So, that's that.
1924463	1929227	So, my review of the Fallout maze was... Sorry, y'all.
1929307	1930388	I disassociated.
1933531	1936153	I'd like to say I was there, but that was only half right.
1937180	1938201	I was there in body.
1938802	1941024	That's it.
1941044	1942246	The makeup was well done, though.
1943127	1944648	The makeup was well done.
1944668	1947692	The creepy-looking creatures and stuff, they looked good.
1947972	1951897	Like, again, I mean, you can get the same type of scares at the local.
1951917	1955220	And I would actually encourage you, go support your local haunted house.
1955260	1958644	These are a lot of the same people I work with when the horror movie and the horror hosting.
1958965	1962829	These are just artists that are taking a seasonal gig to help pay the rent and stuff.
1963089	1964571	Go support your local stuff.
1964551	1974625	At the end of the day, Universal, they're really not doing anything that much different than what you could get locally, except for an FX budget, which is money well spent.
1974965	1980092	It looks very good and everybody looks good, but you know, that's that.
1980112	1980513	Let's see.
1981995	1985360	SS2100Matt says, Rob, you and I both want to go out the same way.
1985740	1989245	Rollercoaster ride set to Rihanna and changing to Adele as it crashes.
1989265	1989926	100%.
1989946	1990327	100%.
1990907	1991248	No Adele.
1991448	1992870	No Adele.
1994572	1995554	No Adele, please.
1996155	1998218	It's the reference to that one meme.
1998238	2008194	It can, you know, it could be, it could actually be, if you don't want Adele, it could actually be the Lady Gaga song, You and I, if that would be an acceptable alternative.
2008755	2009075	Okay.
2009376	2010718	All right.
2010738	2012761	Anyway, that's it for our gaming week.
2012821	2015205	Let's get into some more gaming news.
2015345	2018089	And Loki, the hits just keep on coming.
2018130	2021154	This one's a follow up to last week, right?
2021475	2021575	Yeah.
2021842	2023705	Yeah, it just keeps getting better.
2023825	2026990	So, hey, I know you love EA.
2027471	2029795	You just love EA and all their practices.
2029815	2033922	And you're like, man, EA is just so infallible.
2034022	2038870	Thank goodness there's no way I could possibly hate EA by one of their business practices.
2038990	2044018	Like, I don't know, selling their company to the Saudis that kill people.
2044150	2045953	That don't agree with them.
2046213	2046814	That's cool.
2047115	2047776	Let's do that.
2047916	2053164	Or yeah, $55 billion deal to take the company private.
2053365	2057792	To be fair, because I know there are two things being typed in chat right now.
2058232	2060556	Number one, Saudi already had an investment in EA.
2060676	2062820	They already owned about 9% of the company.
2062840	2065023	Number two, Saudi also has a stake in Nintendo.
2065444	2069571	So I loved the way Bobby... Yeah, but 9 to 100, though.
2069591	2070352	I know, I know.
2070372	2070512	Mm-hmm.
2070492	2071513	I will say this.
2071814	2074437	I loved the way Bobby put this on his show.
2074457	2077842	So I'm going to give credit to our show before us live.
2078162	2083269	The way Bobby put this on his show was he says, Saudi Arabia is going for a cultural victory in civilization.
2083469	2087515	And I was like, that's an accurate analogy.
2087535	2088276	Thank you, Bobby.
2088296	2090619	So I'm stealing that.
2091039	2092281	Without payment.
2094978	2111755	Jared Kushner's Private Equity Group
2111735	2112256	Gross.
2113098	2121594	And, yeah, so, you know, some concerns, obviously, with, you know, Saudi Arabia owning this company is, you know, censorship.
2122556	2127465	Games like, you know, Mass Effect and stuff like that, they have, you know...
2127445	2152457	gay, trans characters, I'm not sure if there's trans characters in but essentially a wide variety of sexual orientations amongst the characters that's not going to probably be just say Mass Effect I said Mass Effect and there was trans in Andromeda because it was actually a point of contention but it's old news at this point
2152437	2162791	OK, well, that said, though, those diverse characters with those types of backgrounds are probably not going to be featured in games, you know, going forward.
2163572	2171883	And, you know, honestly, you know, with like the sports washing stuff that they've done recently with purchasing was the stuff with the WWE.
2171904	2176690	They have, you know, events going on there, comedy festivals, you
2176670	2183597	There's the whole golf, they have their own golf circuit thing that's in Saudi Arabia as well.
2183617	2195928	It's just, I don't see this going well, but also I see this kind of ironically, it's ironically an interesting way for EA to possibly, like their demise.
2196329	2205057	You know, whereas EA is a company that used to purchase a bunch of smaller companies and then take those companies, essentially strip their assets from them and then close those companies and
2206015	2206436	Look at this!
2207338	2208781	It's come full circle.
2209142	2220526	Now we have a private equity group that purchased EA that will of course try to do well with it, but inevitably will strip its assets and sell it off piecemeal.
2220546	2221408	How appropriate.
2222705	2227272	And yeah, Bob Coffee in chat says Asadi Group also bought the EVO tournament.
2227292	2229775	Yeah, Asadi Group also owns what part of wrestling?
2229835	2235363	Asadi Group owns – like there's a lot of – I'm sure – I think one of the big networks, Asadi has an investment in that too.
2235684	2243234	If only there was a governing body that could do something about these types of sales such as saying, no, you can't have these types of sales.
2243254	2245437	If only there were a governing body that could do that.
2245457	2248662	But oh, when –
2248642	2257252	Yeah, but that's why you get the son-in-law involved, and now the president will have a personal stake in this particular type of acquisition.
2257272	2267143	And President Carter sold his peanut farm, but I guess those sorts of norms just don't exist anymore.
2267183	2269265	They don't exist anymore.
2269426	2269986	We don't have norms.
2270507	2273350	What we're going through is not normal.
2274123	2276753	Yeah, Bob Coffey says, if only we had a functional federal government.
2276773	2276974	True.
2277055	2281753	And that's why maybe, maybe that's why this waited until now.
2284990	2286292	Maybe.
2286312	2298691	And I would say if your favorite EA game is not a sports game, is not a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game called, you know, what's not Call of Duty, the other one, Battlefield.
2299813	2301275	But it's shooty, shooty, bang, bang.
2301315	2305602	OK, if it's not a shooty, bang, bang game and if it's not The Sims.
2305802	2305902	Yeah.
2307350	2308613	It's probably in trouble.
2308633	2310517	And yes, that includes Mass Effect.
2310537	2322043	I think the best thing because because what's going to happen now, I want to go back to something I said earlier about people as as much of an issue as Phil Spencer has been these last couple of years.
2322123	2326793	In the beginning, you wanted to root for him a little bit because he was an actual gamer.
2326773	2329436	What's going to happen with this EA thing?
2329456	2334822	A bunch of people who are not gamers are going to get in the room, and they're going to look at Bioware.
2335203	2337205	Let's look at this studio's performance.
2337646	2339087	Okay, what have they been working on?
2339107	2340989	Okay, they put out a game last year.
2341290	2345795	Oh, that game didn't really make the money we were thinking it was going to make.
2345815	2347577	All right, what did that studio do before that?
2347597	2348438	Oh, Anthem.
2349059	2354565	Okay, so you're saying this studio hasn't really put out a profitable game?
2355766	2356307	Oh.
2356287	2358369	Um, huh.
2358950	2363134	Well, you know, I think we got $20 billion in debt.
2363154	2377407	So I think the best you can hope for in this situation is that Mass Effect becomes an asset that is put up for sale that another company who will know how to treat it with dignity will buy it.
2377427	2385535	I just think the ironic thing, the ironic thing is that the people that probably want BioWare the most
2385920	2386240	Who?
2386761	2387041	Who?
2388683	2389284	Microsoft.
2392728	2394810	Who would be the first to put a bid on BioWare?
2394830	2396552	Microsoft.
2396572	2397153	With what money?
2397754	2400317	And there lies the rub.
2401978	2415454	So, I don't, you know, I would, you know, of course, I sit here and cross my fingers and my toes and go, is there a way that there can be a fire sale on Bioshock's IPs and, like, Larian can pick it up?
2416598	2435181	Out of the fog comes a mysterious stranger It is Atari
2436612	2439819	Honestly, I'm not going to hate on that.
2440561	2443928	Atari hasn't had a lot of losing decisions lately.
2443948	2445291	They're kind of like Konami.
2445893	2448518	Atari and Konami are on similar paths.
2448538	2453810	They were laughable 10, 15 years ago, but right now it's kind of like, you're doing good, kid.
2453930	2455093	Keep at it, you know?
2455193	2456055	Yeah.
2457706	2461971	Unless there is any possible way, Bioware could go single again.
2462211	2464974	That would be incredible, but I worry about that.
2465014	2467197	If it's happened before.
2467437	2470721	I see that as a match in heaven.
2470981	2483916	That is like the light your candle before you go to bed tonight in hopes that that, or whatever it is you believe in, thoughts and prayers, whatever it takes, let Larian buy the Bioware IPs in a fire sale and let's get back to the old Bioware.
2483896	2493449	Quest Buster in chat says, I wouldn't be surprised if Ailguard was the last Dragon Age we'll ever see, if not for a long, long time because it missed performance targets unless it's handed to someone else.
2493609	2498897	I agree, unless it's an IP that's sold off, which I would say do not rule out that possibility.
2499738	2508570	That a room full of non-gamer boardroom types will not understand the value of some of these IPs.
2511622	2512404	It's possible.
2512464	2515030	It's just who's going to buy them is the risk there.
2515852	2517536	Keep all the Bioware stuff together.
2517836	2521405	Seeger in chat is saying, the Sims is crazy in trouble with this deal.
2521505	2528381	I'd be curious for you to evaluate because I thought that series actually made EA quite a bit of money even all this time later.
2528421	2530626	And they got a new one ready to launch, right?
2531483	2535090	They just... Their problem with the Sims is their oversaturation.
2535591	2554065	Yeah, but if they've had the money to build, what, 74 expansion packs for the last Sims game, I feel like that's something that, at least on paper, they're going to look... This is going to come down to an Excel spreadsheet, whether a studio is running or closing.
2554045	2555146	Hey, Rob.
2555266	2555506	What?
2556047	2557128	It doesn't have to be Excel.
2557168	2557828	It could be in numbers.
2558269	2567437	Well, considering the subject matter, I think you should let it be with Excel that these studios could be coming and going.
2568478	2574804	SG100 Matt says, My only hope is that when they lay off employees that they treat them well and give them good severance packages.
2574824	2580088	It would be terrible if they do the, quote, soft layoff route that many tech companies are doing these days.
2580929	2584052	That would be nice, and I don't want to be –
2584032	2588119	I'm pessimistic about it, but unfortunately I am.
2588285	2589707	But I hope, yes, I hope you're right.
2590468	2595516	SG-100 Matt says, this won't go through until 2027, so there is time, but not much.
2595917	2598801	There is stuff that will go down sooner rather than later.
2599262	2608295	I would expect to see things start to move around in months, not years.
2608576	2614765	Seeger is elaborating on the Sims stuff, saying Sims is not doing super well, and the themes...
2614880	2615881	Do you have a source for that?
2616401	2621506	I'm sorry, it's just I'm kind of like, again, they've had so many expansions.
2621526	2624949	They're in a holding pattern now because we haven't had a mainline game in a long time.
2625889	2629392	But, okay, super LGBTQ stuff would be in danger.
2629472	2632975	The player base is also primarily LGBTQ+, as well.
2632995	2634577	So take those options away and it's done.
2634657	2636238	Okay, that part I'm with you with.
2636839	2637899	Excuse me, with you on.
2637919	2639501	Yes, that part does make sense.
2639941	2644465	That, unfortunately, those types of themes, they're going to say no...
2645440	2649528	I hate myself with every fiber of my being for what I'm about to say.
2649949	2652494	But they're going to say no woke games.
2652514	2653596	No woke games.
2656482	2659808	I want to wash my mouth out with soap after saying that.
2659888	2660189	Sorry.
2660449	2661532	But I'm just, you know.
2663215	2663776	Am I wrong?
2666581	2667904	Sadly, I don't think I am.
2669977	2671079	All right.
2671760	2672602	Yeah, moving on.
2673323	2680577	Let's get to something, a bit of good news, you know, because and maybe this is what ends up happening.
2680597	2687850	And I've heard of this sort of thing before is that when the gaming industry starts to buckle and starts to sort of
2687830	2717213	you know experience a recession of sorts which I kind of think we've been hurling towards for a while now and this is all just going to accelerate that inevitable happenstance I think there's going to be a lot of people looking at the classics a lot of people looking at old games a lot of people finally looking at their backlog going there's a lot of good games out there I haven't played I should go play some of the Loki will finally go check out his fucking Steam backlog I just added more games to it today it's a self read
2717193	2719177	Oh yeah, the sale's going on too, right?
2719798	2720819	Oh yeah.
2720920	2727331	I have months and months and months of humble choice that I forget to redeem.
2728032	2731018	And so there's like, ooh, Plucky Squire, cool.
2731398	2732540	Throw that in the backlog.
2733162	2734524	It's just like a bunch of games.
2735125	2736788	I'm never going to get around to playing
2736768	2743757	Um, well, the nice thing is there's still a soft spot for nostalgia and nostalgia for these old games will probably squeeze us through.
2743917	2748483	And of course, the Lego Game Boy came out recently, and that's been kind of in the news.
2748503	2753650	I've seen a lot of people posting their builds online and people are really excited about this Lego Game Boy.
2754191	2758877	And I think the question was probably out there from the very beginning of how long is it going to take?
2758857	2762201	for somebody to shove a real Game Boy into a Lego Game Boy.
2762301	2764784	And as it turns out, not long at all.
2765505	2783465	A creator online named NatalieTheNerd, who has a blog on the website NatalieTheNerd.com, actually used this system, the Lego system, to add power to it to actually play genuine Game Boy cartridges.
2783826	2786709	And if you want to see her post over on Blue Sky, you can.
2787029	2788611	She is also verified by Donut
2788591	2808135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2808571	2811316	Oops.
2811736	2826681	Oops.
2826661	2830987	Getting to put a Game Boy inside your Game Boy is always going to be good news.
2831308	2836295	So anyway, yeah, you can use it to play small screen games on there.
2836335	2840140	Now, it's not like this is something that's commercially available out there.
2841022	2847411	There are some fixes that still need to be made, like the A and B keys are currently being held in by an elastic band.
2847491	2850896	There's going to be a 3D printed Lego piece to help fix some of this.
2851336	2856043	And then she does say, I'm going to release this once I'm happy with it, which I would assume would mean...
2856023	2859867	all the parts that you need and 3D printing specs you need to build your own.
2860508	2866354	And honestly, if she doesn't do it soon, I'm sure somebody else will.
2866434	2867315	That's not a read.
2867355	2875263	It's just if it really is supposed to be Patreon paywalled, it's probably a matter of time before somebody else does it anyway.
2875523	2877585	So that's neat, though.
2877625	2882430	It's neat to see people using those nostalgia products for their nostalgia.
2882790	2885473	So, yeah.
2885572	2890138	S2100 Matt points out, I'll finish my LEGO Game Boy build tonight after the show.
2890158	2892461	And QuestBuster says, yay Game Boy goodness.
2892641	2893602	I agree.
2893622	2898148	I just got a bunch of the classic Game Boy stuff on my Steam Deck.
2898468	2910744	What's the first, if you had a Game Boy emulator in front of you with every Game Boy, a LEGO Game Boy with every Game Boy game, what's the first game you'd want to play on it again?
2910784	2911525	Revenge of the Gator.
2912066	2913267	You took my answer.
2914630	2920740	But it's the right answer, Revenge of the Game Fine, Pokemon Pinball Or was that Advance?
2920760	2930235	No, I think there was a Pokemon I think Pokemon Pinball, Red and Blue Or maybe Kid Dracula Okay, okay But I actually have Kid Dracula Loki, what's your answer?
2931497	2939710	I don't know, I do have a Game Boy emulator in front of me But I would say probably there's a...
2940196	2950154	Homebrew Mario game that rescales like because, you know, they ported like the original Mario Brothers to it and stuff like that.
2950194	2952619	But the like scaling was really weird on the Game Boy.
2953100	2959251	So I would play that port with the additional levels and stuff because it's fun.
2959231	2961576	Bobby Blackwolf agrees, Revenge of the Gator.
2961656	2963139	Ranmari says Yoshi's Cookie.
2963179	2963900	That's a good choice, too.
2964261	2965644	DarkTutsia says Tetris.
2965905	2969271	I mean, honestly, a standard.
2969291	2970233	Or Hyper Lode Runner.
2970534	2975945	And OrangeRite says Triple Jinx with Bobby Blackwolf and DarkSakura.
2976165	2977147	Great minds think like us.
2978851	2979151	All right.
2979853	2980314	Let's move on.
2980334	2980935	DarkSakura.
2982147	2985351	So now this is not just good news.
2985371	2987274	This is pretty freaking great.
2987975	3011327	So there was a local monthly fighting game tournament and a new mom who goes by Legion with a zero, a 3D artist actually who sometimes plays fighting games, basically won the tournament with her newborn in her lap five days after a C-section.
3011965	3015189	I don't want to hear any of your excuses, guys, okay?
3016410	3018372	Do you know what a C-section does to you?
3020334	3022657	Do you know how much it hurts to recover from?
3022837	3024098	Not that I've had one.
3024238	3025720	It's a surgery, yeah.
3025880	3028283	But I do own a uterus.
3030205	3037293	And I do have a good background in anatomy, and I know what happens to the body during pregnancy, which is why I don't ever want to do it.
3038154	3038614	Um...
3039269	3066711	but imagine that so that you have been cut open while you are awake having a living being taken from your body sewn back up and five days later winning a Mortal Kombat tournament with this tiny brilliant miracle of a human being in your arms I don't want to hear your excuses I don't have don't want to hear them I don't have any excuses but can I make a joke
3067147	3068769	Oh, no, no, the best thing, the best thing.
3068790	3069691	You know what the kid's name is?
3071033	3071514	Cereza.
3073677	3075079	What was the contestant's name again?
3077683	3078084	Legion.
3078605	3079246	Okay, Legion.
3079286	3081850	So I would say Legion wins.
3082791	3083492	Babality.
3084874	3091264	Yeah, well, but you get where the baby's name comes from, right?
3091514	3092515	No, I don't.
3092615	3094256	I was marinating too much.
3094457	3094857	Bayonetta.
3094917	3096238	Oh, that's a good one.
3096258	3098040	Okay, okay.
3098060	3098440	Yeah.
3099501	3101523	I was marinating too much on my Vivaldi joke.
3101663	3102484	I was like, let me say my joke.
3102504	3103084	Let me say my joke.
3104085	3104545	All right.
3104565	3107848	Yeah, but you're not the first to make it, for the record.
3109350	3109670	Fine.
3109690	3111371	Great minds think like me.
3112232	3121420	But she, with the win, one of her posts says, I only win because she coached me mid-set sending our daughter to DreamHack.
3122378	3129256	Also, she has a habit of trying to bite my chest whenever I hold her upright so her face was smooshed for a fraction of a sec.
3131862	3132424	Very cute.
3132604	3133346	Yeah, it's cute.
3133467	3134008	Very cute.
3134670	3135612	Alright.
3136958	3151333	Yeah, great story about, yeah, again, if you thought you had a hard week or you can't do something because of it's hard or something, it's a nice story to remind us.
3151353	3153555	You can probably do more than you think you can.
3155297	3155397	Yeah.
3155417	3155658	All right.
3156478	3160523	But what you can't do right now is not patch your Unity game, right, Loki?
3160723	3160823	Yeah.
3161647	3181393	Yeah, you probably could patch your Unity game, but it is going to be a little bit tricky because there was a recently discovered security vulnerability that affected any games and applications built on Unity version 2017.1 and later.
3181373	3183215	That's great.
3183275	3197593	For Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, there's no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers, according to Larry, Major Nelson Herb.
3199175	3207145	Of course, along with that, though, Obsidian Entertainment did pull their Pillars of Eternity 2, Deadfire, and Pentament,
3207125	3213756	as well as more games from Steam on Friday just as a precautionary measure.
3214457	3218784	They're going to be rolling out a patch for that though to fix the vulnerability.
3220327	3222771	I haven't opened Unity in a while.
3222953	3247375	I definitely saw games getting patched this week Ingress and the Niantic stuff was definitely getting all patched I feel like I had a lot of phone apps update this week which makes sense, Unity is used in a lot of phone game development and boy are they keeping a tight lip on what the vulnerability really was which makes sense, they don't want people to actually there's a lot of games that haven't patched yet and they don't want to get out there
3247355	3248436	Don't give them any ideas.
3248617	3248837	Exactly.
3248857	3250299	Don't give them any ideas type of thing.
3250859	3259230	But of course you want to know like, well, shit, how bad is it that they've got to be doing all these games and stuff this week?
3259250	3263395	But we're not going to know because that's the plan is to not tell us.
3264696	3269362	But I would say, was this an ethical hacker that figured this out and sent it to Unity?
3269382	3273447	Because it sounds like somebody found this and instead of doing anything –
3273427	3279559	Negative with it, they went straight to Unity and were like, hey, I found a problem.
3279739	3287655	Yeah, I don't think it mentions who reported it, but yeah, somehow they found it, so...
3287821	3291105	SJ100Matt says, I'm sure YYR had to update stuff.
3291125	3295790	Yeah, hopefully the process isn't too difficult.
3296050	3313069	Again, I heard Bobby talking a little bit about this on his show, and it sounds like you don't have to get in there and update a bunch of code, that it has more to do with the actual executable runtime file, and you can patch that even if you don't have all your old code.
3313049	3323072	So that's kind of nice that, you know, you don't go because heaven forbid, there's probably a lot of studios that have closed since 2017 that have Unity games that are actually running.
3323092	3326280	So, yeah, hopefully YYR is able to update his stuff.
3326320	3332053	No problem as well, because I would hate to see them start pulling games that don't adhere to this.
3332033	3346574	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, the vulnerability was, quoting from the email that was sent to Unity, or from Unity, says, the vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher Ryotak, and we thank him for working with us.
3346594	3355787	I feel like that's a very nice way of saying ethical hacker, which actually I don't think is a negative term at all, but probably not a polite one in the context of an email like this.
3355847	3360994	So, but yeah, I mean, that guy could have done some shitty things, or
3360974	3361655	or Person.
3361675	3365881	That person could have done a lot of shitty things with that information, but they didn't.
3365901	3368384	So good on them.
3370927	3371588	Let's move on.
3372850	3374192	Politics, politics, politics.
3374252	3375213	It's never ending.
3375233	3375854	But guess what?
3375914	3378477	This one has nothing to do with us.
3378578	3379399	Well, a little bit maybe.
3379439	3381902	It has more to do with what's going on in Japan.
3382169	3404700	and a politician from Japan's House of Representatives, Satoshi Asano, made a post on social media saying that Nintendo was "...avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP and "...engaging in lobbying activities with the government."
3405153	3408478	Nintendo actually came out and denied this.
3409459	3413425	And that's a rare thing for Nintendo to do.
3414867	3431312	But on the right-wing social media site X, Nintendo's account, their Japanese account, actually published a statement that says, "...contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI."
3431292	3454161	whether generative AI is involved or not we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights and that was the particular post there from Nintendo that they actually posted interesting that they actually called that out um
3454850	3460356	Damn right, you better.
3460997	3477735	What do you mean?
3483824	3485847	Literally, I'm speechless.
3487309	3489512	You're trying to get a jump, is what they're trying to do.
3489572	3492155	Wouldn't that be nice if that's how it was?
3492856	3498063	Wouldn't it be nice if when people were wrong, they say, oops, I was wrong and I'm sorry?
3498724	3508397	Wouldn't that be what people of integrity and high... I think it's a foreign concept here, though.
3508617	3508778	Clearly.
3508798	3509899	Clearly.
3510031	3531274	Anyway, outgoing Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has talked about Nintendo's and AI previously saying, quote, if we think about just technology in general to start with, as we look at technology, we always want to make sure the technology we may be leveraging, whether it's to develop our games or in our devices, it's going to create a better gameplay experience.
3531294	3532135	It starts there.
3532295	3539143	It's a very important part of our decision-making process and how to use AI, which honestly is a real fluff statement.
3539123	3543649	But it does go to show at least that they're not being reckless about it.
3544170	3552422	It does sort of say to me the justification for is the game fun needs to still be there.
3552962	3555746	If we use AI on our game, is the game still going to be fun?
3555866	3557689	That's going to be our driving principle.
3558445	3586967	which is not a bad principle to have especially compared to peers because that says to me you're thinking less about generative AI and that crap and cutting or especially when it comes to art and that kind of crap and more like maybe how can our own internal mechanisms you know sort of improve and so forth which you know it's interesting it's interesting but they have not said anything as far as the official Japanese government goes
3588247	3596196	Anyway, yeah, and Rinmari does point out where Japanese people still post, it's because they don't know any better.
3596216	3600821	Most of them try Blue Sky or Miski for five seconds and just go back to Twitter.
3601342	3602062	I understand.
3602223	3607829	I'm also going to remind folks where the money you make on X, where that goes.
3608269	3612054	And that's if you still decide, that's fine.
3612074	3612394	That's you.
3613315	3614136	But yeah.
3614116	3641423	DarkSakura
3642533	3650028	So, in one of the happier pieces of news, I get the happy stuff today, don't I?
3652312	3656180	Well, there's more good Silent Hill news.
3656300	3664356	There's going to be a remake of the first Silent Hill, and it's already going into full production, working with Bloober Team.
3664336	3669685	Um, they said, I'm going to read the translated statement.
3669705	3672529	Um, this is, uh, during an investor call.
3673250	3681484	We have two first party production teams, one of which is working on Silent Hill one project and the other started working on the next project.
3681584	3682866	Please be Silent Hill three.
3683808	3688335	Um, and then they also discussed, uh, Kronos, the new Dawn, um,
3689648	3700671	which got really good reviews but Konami did tease it already with those photos and stuff but this is good news this is good news
3702338	3708470	Yeah, especially, you know, when there was a little bit of worry about the Silent Hill 2 remake and it turned out pretty good.
3708530	3712618	Now it's, I feel like everybody's kind of at ease about this.
3712638	3713740	Like, all right, bring it on.
3713820	3715142	Let's do it.
3715162	3716685	All right, Bloober, you did something.
3716705	3717226	Let's go.
3717246	3717747	Let's go.
3717767	3718389	Do it again.
3718409	3719010	Two in a row.
3719210	3720132	Don't, don't.
3720192	3724220	I really want Silent Hill 3 because, you know, that's my favorite of them all.
3724240	3724380	Mm-hmm.
3724360	3751330	All right, Loki.
3752744	3764575	Alright, so this is disappointing, but apparently Avalanche Studios has announced that their studio located in Liverpool is shutting down.
3765475	3773643	I haven't really heard much from them as far as new games coming out, but I know that one that obviously comes to mind for me is Just Cause.
3774103	3774964	Love that series.
3775104	3780709	But yeah, apparently they posted a short update saying that the company...
3781027	3787517	has been that all employees will be impacted and that that Liverpool location is being closed.
3788338	3796130	Also, they're going to be planning layoffs for its Swedish studios as well in Malmo in Stockholm.
3797211	3799435	So, yeah, that sucks.
3800276	3804182	Maybe that could be because we haven't heard of any games that they're putting out.
3804517	3827368	I guess they're working on a game called Contraband but I haven't heard too much about that other than that and that was announced back in 2021 um yeah that sucks but if you don't have the revenue coming in I guess that makes sense I mean it's just one after another and it's one week this is one week in 2025 I don't know what else to say
3828344	3834779	Let's move on and talk about Departure from the Mortal Kombat studio.
3834899	3836543	And it's one you might recognize.
3836623	3839349	It's the guy that says, Toasty!
3839370	3846927	Although it's been a few years since that guy showed up because he was with, and this is Dan Forden who we're talking about, who was the audio director at Mortal Kombat.
3846907	3849390	He was with that studio for 30 years.
3850211	3851212	He left NetherRealm.
3851232	3851912	Yeah, he left.
3852553	3860181	And on October 2nd, he made a post to Instagram that Wednesday was his last... I'm just laughing at all the social media announcements.
3860301	3863224	That Wednesday was his last day at NetherRealm.
3864245	3873235	And previously, he went all the way back to Midway Chicago and worked pretty much through Mortal Kombat 1, which came out a couple years ago.
3873215	3875608	and of course you know him as the toasty guy.
3875709	3877740	He looks a lot different now.
3877906	3880990	Age, it happens, right?
3882672	3887177	Toasty Dan is who he's referred to as sometimes online.
3887197	3889900	Interesting quotes in his goodbye post.
3889940	3892844	He says, we made a lot of fun stuff over the years.
3892864	3897309	I'm really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff.
3897329	3899572	There are so many smart, talented people there.
3899932	3904137	Look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.
3904758	3904858	Yeah.
3904838	3913248	Thanks to all of you in supporting what we've done.
3915014	3916519	Goodbye and good luck.
3917191	3918974	Enjoy retirement, though, dude.
3919014	3919515	You earned it.
3919935	3921558	You definitely left a legacy in gaming.
3923061	3924743	It's not just the toasty thing.
3924763	3930693	I actually think the sound in the Mortal Kombat games is part of what makes those games great.
3930713	3936162	It put it on a different... It distincted itself from Street Fighter.
3936142	3958977	and this is a very different musical style too yeah not yeah the music and the sound effects it just it lent itself to that style that made it different from Street Fighter at the end of the day and um yeah so enjoy retirement hope you hope you get some you know like cruises or whatever it is you enjoy all right anyway uh let's get to our next segment another classic
3969301	3977156	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3977176	3980161	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3980582	3984009	But tonight we have a once a month special.
3984229	3989599	It's the classic arcade game that then became a console game.
3989759	3992845	So what is our classic arcade to console game this week, DarkSakura?
3993550	3995013	Excitebike.
3995033	3999282	And indeed, this one became console to arcade back to console.
4000524	4010344	So, of course, I am referring to the version for the versus Unisystem, as in versus Excitebike.
4010459	4016847	There were two enhanced versions, both that were titled versus Excitebike.
4017208	4020412	So we're going to start, though, with the arcade version.
4021413	4034890	It came out in 1984, and it's very similar to the Famicom disc version, even though it lacks, of course, the design option for custom tracks.
4034910	4037594	It has three difficulty levels and a few other differences.
4037994	4039977	And among these differences...
4039957	4045711	is, well, I mean, first of all, it has seven tracks instead of five, like the NES.
4046654	4050323	And they're more like remix tracks is what they are.
4050964	4056177	But after you finish the seventh track, the last stage will just loop itself until you lose.
4056781	4058685	I mean it is pretty repetitive.
4059046	4070149	But the other cool features that it has is that there is a bonus game that will challenge you to hit ramps in order to jump over stacked trucks for extra points.
4070534	4091699	and then the other one is sort of like a wipeout mode where you have to make the other players crash and then your character will change colors going from, you know, go to red, yellow or a black color scheme and have unlimited turbo until you crash.
4092500	4095183	But other than that, it's Excitebike.
4095724	4096525	Now...
4097230	4103498	The other version is Versus Excite for the Famicom Disk System.
4104259	4107063	So it's basically you can play Versus.
4107744	4108645	You can play with a friend.
4109506	4113271	And it has different music done by Okasoyo.
4114432	4124385	And then you have original Excite mode where it's based off of the main mode of the arcade version with some minor differences like the color palette.
4124365	4126990	and it is a writable disc that can save your tracks.
4127731	4139792	So I brought that up because it's sort of getting an arcade port of a port of a home game
4140835	4146202	We have the arcade port of the home game, and then you have a home game port of the arcade game.
4147724	4149467	Yeah, what I just said.
4149487	4150068	No, I get it.
4150088	4151069	In a way that makes sense.
4151189	4154774	No, it's wild, yeah, how this kind of went back and forth and back and forth, right?
4155956	4161884	And that version, for the record, I do believe has come out on a virtual arcade since.
4165148	4165729	So there you go.
4166553	4167674	There it is.
4167694	4168755	Your arcade console game.
4168815	4170837	A favorite of mine, actually.
4171378	4172699	Excitebike.
4172879	4174621	You know there was a BS Excitebike?
4175562	4185292	Yes, there was a BS Excitebike, and there was one on the 3DS that I think was based off the arcade version.
4185312	4187074	I can't remember, but there was a 3DS one.
4187094	4188896	That's the virtual console one, right?
4189536	4190097	It was different.
4190117	4193320	It actually had the layers, like Kid Icarus had one, too.
4193300	4196466	Yeah, that was Boom Boom Mario Battle Stadium.
4196486	4197748	Okay, okay.
4197828	4208286	Excitebike Boom Boom Mario Battle Station, which is also known as Mario Excitebike, or BS Excitebike, was a remake that only came out for this to tell of you, but I think that that one was re-released.
4210110	4212274	Hold on, I'm just double-checking that one.
4212294	4214818	There was 3D Classics Excitebike.
4215355	4220508	Have I actually done Excitebike as a classic game?
4220829	4221851	I want to think that I did.
4223074	4225500	No, the one that has like the...
4226206	4228028	I'm wrong.
4228268	4232473	That was back to the Satellaview one, which was Mario, Luigi, Princess, Peach, Wario, and Toad.
4235516	4236557	Okay, I see.
4236577	4244706	There was an Animal Crossing No, that was the one that was in Animal Crossing that could be transferred to Game Boy Advance.
4244946	4247409	I'm just looking through it now because I didn't read through the rest of the stuff.
4250172	4255538	Excitebike was added to Wii's Virtual Console the day that Excite Truck was released.
4256159	4272105	and then it later came out on the North American Virtual Console and then there were 3D Classics Excitebike on the 3DS and had stereoscopic support and it didn't say anything about the characters.
4272867	4274269	All right.
4274738	4280530	but still a true classic, especially on the Nintendo front in all its different forms.
4280550	4285601	Yeah, I think it's important to note and you're kind of bringing to the forefront by highlighting the arcade version.
4285661	4293658	There are many versions of this game that are different from what you would have played on the Nintendo Entertainment System and not just the fact that you had a very...
4293638	4300191	Hmm, kind of lazy port of a Famicom Disk System game where the save and load were left in, you know, type of thing.
4301093	4306664	Not just that, but just, you know, the fact that they actually, you know, different courses and there are more of them and all the other things you pointed out.
4306684	4308107	So good times.
4309129	4309710	All right.
4310251	4314620	Well, let's cover some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
4314720	4315782	Loki, we'll start with you.
4316572	4324743	Alright, Fallout 76 has some new updates coming to tie into the Fallout TV show.
4324903	4335637	So not only will they also have an expansion that will go to Ohio, but you'll be able to run into the ghoul from the Fallout TV show.
4336939	4340083	And yeah, that's going to be coming out here very soon.
4340984	4345330	And then along with that, we've also got...
4346575	4353274	Let's see, so Marvel Cosmic Invasion, that awesome looking beat-em-up game has a demo.
4353294	4354076	Go check it out.
4354397	4355260	Looks cool.
4355280	4356122	Can't wait to play it.
4357185	4358208	I definitely want to check that out.
4360455	4360956	DarkSakura.
4362438	4365823	So I'm mostly excited about this one.
4366564	4376939	And this is why I said that I was trying to finish up Secret of the Spires before the movie came out, is that there is going to be new DLC for Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.
4377620	4379303	Which, you know, I freaking love that game.
4379483	4380905	It's so good.
4380925	4382447	So good.
4383008	4390960	But this game, this DLC is going to happen immediately after Fire and Ash.
4391817	4397345	and you have to play as... This is the part that doesn't make me happy.
4397445	4402653	I want to play as my character, my side-into character that I've been playing since the beginning of the damn game.
4402673	4410325	But instead you play as Sotlek, who is the person who rescues you at the start of the game, who helps guide you out of the place.
4411226	4416414	He's had his own comic and other stuff going on.
4416875	4420440	And he's a great character, don't get me wrong, but
4421180	4437687	I just want to play my character.
4438645	4440508	I think this is really cool.
4440588	4455051	This is a new collectible that's on its way out.
4455031	4467169	The Definitive Visual Chronicle of Sony's World-Changing Video Game Console, marking its 30th anniversary with unprecedented access to the archive of R&D prototypes, concept sketches, and developmental models.
4467229	4479927	And actually, if you start to look through some of the pages that are out there of the book, you actually see that, and I don't even know what some of these are supposed to be, if this is actually what the PlayStation system concept might have looked like in the beginning, because that's kind of what it looks like.
4479947	4481730	Those might be controller ports in the front.
4481710	4485896	or if we actually have maybe some early controller prototypes.
4486778	4488019	I think some of these have been out there.
4488060	4495110	This first one looks familiar to me that maybe you've seen before, but it's kind of interesting to see these captured in photo form.
4495451	4498876	I have no idea what this thing we're looking at on the stream is supposed to be.
4499437	4501660	It's the analog stick.
4502163	4503946	Oh, it's like the transparent.
4504186	4505187	Okay, I get it.
4505208	4507451	Oh, it's just that taken out of... I'm like, what is this?
4507471	4508512	Is that like a plunger?
4508733	4512278	Okay, yeah, that's... It's a very different look at the analog stick.
4512759	4515783	So it's a lot of different types of photographs and it looks really cool.
4516164	4517346	Now, here's the thing, though.
4517426	4522233	This book is going to cost you $125 for the standard edition.
4522734	4523715	But...
4523695	4548522	it's 400 pages and it does sound like this is like a collectible photography book this is the nice book that's on the coffee table or your version of it this is the nice book in a prominent place in your game room or on your bookshelf it's that kind of book this is a fancy book this is the fancy china we don't eat off it every day okay so this is you know a pretty cool book for you know gaming collectors a
4548502	4551667	Jamie, this felt like the thing that would be right up your alley to me, honestly.
4552107	4554571	I thought you could appreciate this.
4554912	4556634	I'm happy about it.
4556694	4560320	I think it's going to be great, but it's nothing that's in my budget for now.
4560560	4561481	Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.
4561621	4562783	It is something to consider.
4562803	4572998	And if you have an even bigger budget, I should mention there is a deluxe edition, $325, limited to 1,994 copies.
4573018	4574080	1994, haha.
4574741	4576804	It includes the book,
4576784	4587560	Exposed Binding, A Clamshell Presentation Box, and Exclusive Prints.
4587580	4590404	So something a little extra special.
4591105	4593649	I know what bookbinding looks like.
4593749	4595591	I would rather have my binding protected.
4595631	4595952	Thank you.
4595972	4598415	It's a very stylish choice.
4598996	4602381	That's a book you really don't take out and read on the toilet.
4602401	4604985	I've done bookbinding, okay?

4700711	4705218	L-A-P-P-I-N Oh wow, I wonder if it's about the original thief.
4707021	4707361	Interesting.
4707401	4708182	I don't know.
4709464	4709925	I don't know.
4710045	4714071	It's a game that doesn't look like anything that has to do with that.
4714472	4718918	They look like really creepy looking bunny things.
4719038	4721642	Lappin means rabbit.
4722297	4729587	Yes, it's the rabbits who live underneath a park that have to leave for a new home as the humans started a renovation.
4730728	4732310	So it's Watership Down Light?
4733792	4734433	Maybe.
4734934	4741963	It says Libby, a white rabbit, goes on an adventure with Captain, Bianca, Jose, and Montblanc.
4741983	4745748	What will happen when these five rabbits go on their adventure?
4745969	4747771	Well... It looks cute.
4748773	4749874	It's rabbits.
4751153	4753336	And they're not raving or rabid.
4753856	4756399	So, you know, I don't know what to think about that.

4898766	4908315	We also have, um, coming up on, I think that's actually it for the Switch 2, but I want to take a look at the PlayStation 5, because usually that's still pretty busy over in Japan.
4909036	4912860	And, uh, yes, we have Little Nightmares 3 also releases in Japan.
4913601	4920127	Uh, and then, uh, we have Battlefield 6 making its way to Japan, which I'm sure you all are thrilled about after this week's news.
4920748	4923130	Uh, but you know, that series has its fans, so...
4923110	4923631	That's that.
4923911	4927254	That's actually really it for Japanese releases this week.
4927274	4928836	Just a few big tentpoles there.
4929677	4932820	Not a lot of other stuff at this time.
4932860	4934442	But we've got more to move on.

4979849	4982913	On October 9th is Crash-O-Cars for Switch.

5041538	5042179	All right.
5043120	5046965	Hope you have some happy gaming coming up in your near future.
5047846	5049628	We're getting towards the end of the show here.
5049869	5056758	And usually at the end of the show, we would open up for the listener roundtable where we take your comments and we take your emails.
5056878	5061724	Not to discourage you from emailing the show, participate at orangelaunchradio.com or you can...
5061704	5066572	or interact with us on social media if you want over at bluesky at orangelaunchradio.com.
5066672	5069096	And then, of course, we always take your comments in chat.
5069697	5073564	But there is something we actually wanted to bring to you guys tonight in this segment.
5073924	5079053	And I actually wasn't sure if we were going to talk about this tonight, but I think we are going to.
5079113	5081637	I think it's time to bring this up.
5081617	5098274	because, you know, this show was kind of conceived in this roundtable format of folks that are having, you know, dinner after a long day of gaming, whether it's DDR as we were playing back in the day or other games.
5098294	5106483	Otherwise, it's kind of sitting around and, you know, talking about our favorite pastime, which is playing video games and all the other nerdy things that we enjoy.
5106523	5109666	And that's that roundtable that we're all at.
5109646	5119321	And so this is probably an important point for me to let you know and bring to this roundtable that I've asked to leave this show.
5119883	5121850	And...
5123281	5130451	After 23 years, I'm going to be leaving this show at the end of November, on November 23rd to be exact.
5130471	5135138	And I'm sorry, there's really no easy way to state this kind of news.
5135178	5142949	And I'm sure some of you are going to be very, very blindsided and surprised and shocked at this news.
5143149	5146354	And I wish I had a better or easier way of kind of putting it.
5147515	5149558	But the reality is that
5149538	5154925	I sort of said a long time ago that when things stop being fun in this space,
5155630	5182093	and DarkSakura.
5182597	5203002	and there's other elements in my life I guess I shouldn't say that like I'm not a fan of gaming I'm always going to be a fan of video games but maybe I don't wish to continue spending every Sunday night talking about an industry that I'm just watching continue to shoot itself in the foot and
5203420	5218864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5219232	5220914	I'm breaking up the band, right?
5220975	5223258	That I'm, you know, causing this whole thing.
5223278	5223939	Okay, Yoko.
5223959	5228646	But, well... But, you know, it's... I had to make the joke.
5228746	5229147	I know, no.
5229187	5229968	And you should.
5230008	5230749	We should make jokes.
5230989	5238240	But it's one of those things where it's like, I have no easier way to put it than sometimes you recognize it's time.
5239582	5242186	And after 23 and a half years, I think I recognize it's time.
5243348	5245831	And that doesn't mean... I want to be very clear.
5246172	5248395	I'm not doing this to...
5249253	5250655	Start an OLR 2.0.
5251196	5251857	That's not it.
5252337	5254520	Will I continue to talk about games?
5254540	5255001	Maybe.
5256023	5257845	Although that's kind of hard to think about right now.
5259187	5261630	But not in this weekly sort of space.
5261851	5267999	I think TikTok, YouTube, somewhere in a future media type of thing.
5268500	5272746	But I think this spending multiple hours of a Sunday...
5273384	5285773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5287188	5292533	Stop This, which is obviously a hard thing to bring up.
5292553	5300161	But Loki, I know we talked about it, and I believe you've come to a similar conclusion, right?
5300361	5303064	I've basically come to a similar conclusion as well.
5303264	5312233	It's hard to be excited about a gaming industry that's just constantly in this kind of turmoil and politics and everything with...
5312213	5313254	What's going on?
5313355	5317580	I remember a time back when we were just really excited and positive about the gaming industry.
5318021	5322827	It seems like every week they were just talking about something negative with that.
5323448	5331139	Whereas this show could continue on forever, does that really make sense to do that?
5331619	5333963	It's gone.
5333983	5341613	We've already been awarded an award for the longest running gaming podcast.
5342082	5346528	And sure, it could keep going, but at what point are we really enjoying it?
5346628	5350193	It's just kind of more of going through the motions with some of that stuff.
5351055	5361069	And I feel like my energy right now is better focused on trying to grow my community with the Minecraft stuff that I've been doing.
5361149	5364293	I've been literally pouring all the hours and
5364391	5388120	any additional hours I have even during work hours sometimes into to try to like get that you know more feasible and growing whereas you know certainly I love this audience I love all the community that we've you know that have come and left and during the entire time that we've been doing this but like it's just it's
5388455	5412893	it's hard it's hard to like stay positive about it and like be excited about it instead of just feel like I'm just regurgitating what I'm reading in the news am I really adding anything on top of that anymore like I've been out of the game industry for like a long time now so it doesn't feel like I even have that kind of like well here's you know the insider look at this you know type of stuff it's I don't know like how many more weeks are we gonna go where it's like hey look
5414037	5415699	The game industry is worse now.
5416199	5416940	There's more layoffs.
5417140	5417620	Hey, guess what?
5417640	5419242	You know that Microsoft story we just talked about?
5419262	5421624	There's probably more layoffs coming in 2026 as well.
5421704	5426248	So, like, along with that, it's just going to be more of this.
5426288	5431093	And I'm sure there's going to be, like, indie studios, and I'm sure there's going to be games that are going to come out that we can be excited about.
5431113	5433875	We can also be excited about that without having to talk about it every single week.
5434536	5437659	So, it's tough.
5437839	5442323	It's, you know, in one hand, like, you want to keep it going forever, but, like,
5443602	5449794	In the back of your mind, at least for me, it's like, am I really utilizing this time as best I can?
5449834	5451217	I'm 45 years old.
5451477	5456126	There's not a lot of time left.
5456146	5461697	I mean, you got like half your life, but it's the later half of your life already.
5461777	5464041	So it's, I don't know.
5465422	5471270	But now, Jamie, I want to turn it over to you because you have kind of taken this news... Because I'm a stubborn, spiteful bitch.
5471290	5474514	You have taken this news in a different direction, and I want to turn it over to you.
5475115	5475676	I'm not quitting.
5476857	5477518	I'm going to keep going.
5477979	5492678	I'm making arrangements with certain people who know who they are to birth something messy and sticky and tentacly from... It's an afterbirth.
5492879	5493960	It's an afterbirth.
5495611	5498955	We're working through some details.
5498975	5501818	Are you saying that guy's going to get his way in the afterburst coming back?
5501858	5503880	That guy that left.
5506803	5507884	Cage match, cage match.
5508625	5509145	Keep in mind.
5512209	5514431	We're floating names around.
5514771	5517434	A couple of them I might need to get okay.
5517534	5520377	And one of them thrown up was OLR2ElectricBoogaloo.
5521098	5521939	Probably not.
5522510	5525755	You vote for Gay Bar.
5526235	5527497	Gay Bar is our new theme song.
5527517	5528038	There you go.
5528418	5537211	Maybe this is a good thing to be able to be transparent in this part of the process is that you don't know if you want to call it Orange Lounge Radio or not, if I'm not mistaken.
5537972	5538693	No, we're not.
5538994	5539715	Okay, you're not.
5539835	5541577	I was making a joke.
5542238	5547606	Then Orange Lounge Radio, as we know it, will conclude on the 23rd of November.
5547586	5558946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5560934	5580057	so far so far so there's still some things to do I mean what else the fuck am I doing on Sunday night here's the thing crocheting it's important to be transparent about this a little bit because that way Jamie is on her way to TwitchCon in two weeks she has the freedom now to talk about this because you all have heard it from us first
5580037	5593503	She has now the freedom to talk about this with whoever she wants and whatever potential collaborators there might be in the future and so forth and figure out what those next steps are going to look like before 23rd November, which is when that will be episode 1070.
5593904	5598613	I thought about episode 1069, but I didn't want to base it on numerology.
5598633	5602821	I just wanted to base it on this is the day and that's it.
5602801	5618818	that's an excellent question Mike Deft Mike Deft says I think the other question is what will Rob's involvement in VOG be I do still plan to be around with VOG I just think what my contribution is to VOG looks very different than what it does today
5618798	5623346	My gut, I think, honestly, you know what I'm doing is I'm giving myself a vacation.
5624187	5630959	And then I think maybe next year, I might start to think about that roundtable concept that's kind of been on again, off again.
5631600	5638832	That's where I sort of see a future because I'm going to tell you the most important part of that roundtable concept, they were flexible.
5638812	5643717	Yes.
5645799	5665377	Yes.
5665357	5680108	is part of it I want to take more long weekend trips yes is part of it there are things that happen on Sundays I have not done in 20 years yes is part of it um that um damn I lost my train of thought um
5680662	5681283	is part of it.
5681303	5686687	Oh, the fact that live hosting has really picked up for me since COVID.
5686707	5690731	And I have had to say no to gigs on Sunday night because of this show.
5690751	5693013	And this is something that now will be opened up for me.
5693033	5697337	And that's a part of my life that I have really enjoyed exploring and being a part of.
5697477	5710669	And yes, that is all factoring into it too, is that this allows me to potentially pick up other conventions or other shows on Sunday night, like live shows, not internet podcasts and things like that.
5710649	5714214	Short answer, Deft, I will still be involved with VOG.
5715095	5717819	Nothing we have said tonight affects Bobby Blackwolf.
5718159	5721403	That's for him to talk about when he's ready.
5722205	5725950	If his show goes longer or what he's going to do.
5726390	5727712	That's Bobby's thing.
5728413	5731978	He is aware of this, except I don't think he knew we were going to do it tonight.
5732739	5733460	But it is what it is.
5733980	5738867	And there will still continue to be a VOG.
5738847	5762914	Um, yeah.
5764396	5766302	And good luck to Jamie and her team with that.
5766362	5775412	No, I think it is cool that you're going to keep it going, especially for the folks that are here on Sundays and have been a part of this little family for so long.
5775432	5777258	I'm glad there can be something.
5777609	5800005	Hey, DarkSakura!
5799985	5822837	and DarkSakura.com.
5822817	5849280	I suggested earlier that we have this out now because I'd like to hear what people have to say if we don't get spam email that is so I want to give people a week to process while we're fresh here to say things and then before I go to TwitchCon
5849429	5854374	And I don't want to rule out either, but I want to be very careful how I walk this line.
5854714	5859659	I don't want to rule out the potential that the three of us can reunite for other things.
5860400	5865845	Preserving the friendship with Loki and Jamie is the most important thing to me out of all of this, of course.
5865905	5866826	Not that it was ever at risk.
5866846	5869068	Are you still going to get memes from me all the time?
5869088	5879318	Yeah, and not that any of that was ever at risk, but I'm just saying that I do see a situation where the three of us can still come together once in a while to talk about some big things.
5879298	5906655	and but is that going to be every week no is that going to be you know it's spontaneous as we're able to make it happen sure you know like if Jamie's willing amongst her new project as well and Loki amongst everything he's working on and so forth like absolutely that's something so I but I don't also don't want to give false hope you know that's that's why I'm saying it's a tricky line right I don't want to be like but it's not really over because we'll still get together once in a
5907091	5910576	Orange Ones Radio, as you know it, is going to be done on November 23rd.
5911777	5913760	But hopefully the future won't be so bad.
5914281	5914861	You know what I mean?
5915022	5917986	It's going to be okay, right?
5918006	5921350	But Rob made a good point earlier about all of us developing our other things.
5921450	5924554	And it's not just another podcast.
5924574	5927078	I've been floating another podcast idea for a while.
5928800	5931664	And like a Dead by Daylight machinima kind of thing.
5932345	5935249	But I'm also trying to grow my own channel.
5936070	5936170	Yeah.
5936639	5939262	I enjoy streaming.
5940244	5942126	I enjoy having people there to interact with.
5942226	5943648	I would love one day to be partner.
5944349	5946472	I mean, I think that would just be absolutely tremendous.
5947473	5959288	But I've been doing this every Sunday, and I like being out there and loud and talking shit.
5960315	5974074	and I think that there is still an opportunity to give the alternative view on what happens not just in gaming but I mean geek culture in general.
5974595	5987233	We've got a big opportunity for that to specifically speak on how they all interact together and also to speak out against the injustices going on in the world because they're affecting all of us.
5987213	5997796	Just because we like video games and we might be into anime and we might like Doctor Who or watching these shows does not mean we do not have a serious opinion.
5999059	6001263	So, I'm going to keep that going.
6001283	6003889	And Rinmari, I adore you and...
6004392	6008458	and yeah, you came over and you've been through a lot with us.
6008538	6009840	All of us have been through some shit.
6010161	6023380	I also kind of like looking at this as sort of an evolution and there was a point, you know, there's a couple of points really when OLR evolved, you know, we were a show about Bomani exclusively and we sort of hit a reset button at one point with that.
6023360	6025623	to be really about games.
6025663	6031330	And that was also part of this whole merging podcasting with what we were doing all the way back on Live 365 and all that.
6031390	6033713	This show has been through a few changes.
6034234	6040762	And I love what you're saying there, Jamie, about maybe really looking at the voice of geeks being about geeks now.
6040903	6045148	And what you're bringing to this being about...
6045128	6064774	everything else that's not just video games sure that's part of it but everything else as well and based on who I am aware you're talking to I think you're talking to all the right people for that sort of project so it sounds very exciting so sorry to be one of those people was the first person I reached out to do not say who you are
6064754	6069259	Yeah, so there's... Yeah, some more to come on that.
6069279	6079810	I did want to call out the chat comment, and actually this has been raised a couple times, but TravisC78 in chat says, sucks to hear, but much respect for calling on your own terms.
6079830	6083714	And a couple of you have actually used that, your own terms, going on your own terms.
6084134	6091622	That is absolutely a huge part of this decision, is wanting to do this...
6091602	6093745	When it's something that's under our control.
6093765	6095748	Because we've had scares in the past.
6096489	6099153	Where it might have been something that wasn't part of our control.
6101857	6105662	Not to be too dark, but I had a near-death experience when I was 29.
6105682	6107364	And this show was on at that time.
6107805	6111931	You know, there have been some very sombering moments that make us go, shit.
6111951	6113213	All of us have gotten married.
6113373	6114615	Yeah, very true.
6115256	6116357	So, anyway.
6117138	6117559	Um...
6118602	6119424	There it is.
6119444	6120286	That's the big news.
6120707	6126579	And I know there was not a lot of warning about that.
6126800	6135919	But I think those of you that are here, because I do feel like it is possible that some people's ears are going to perk up about a
6135899	6143128	23 plus long year running podcast deciding to close its doors to open different doors somewhere else.
6144469	6152439	But we wanted you all that are here week after week and on the podcast feed to be able to hear this from us first.
6153820	6160168	And just to say for the people who noticed I had been really out of sorts over the last few weeks, this is why.
6161330	6170343	So, I couldn't say anything, but this is... I'm in the place of numbness right now.
6171906	6176172	Where my brain just sort of goes right over it and just starts thinking about future things.
6177213	6179677	So, yeah.
6180138	6182621	I'm... I'm okay.
6182641	6182742	Okay.
6186407	6187168	Um...
6187503	6189588	I'm the okayest pig main on Twitch right now.
6189828	6190249	I'm kidding.
6190430	6196584	As far as what the future shows look like, it's business as usual through the 23rd of November.
6196604	6198829	There will be a show I'm missing.
6199079	6202966	Which will be dark that night, October 26th.
6203347	6204308	There will be no show.
6204489	6207434	I have a work-based situation that I cannot control.
6208897	6211642	This or not this, I would not be here October 26th.
6212002	6217673	Jamie will not be here the week before due to TwitchCon, but otherwise it's business as usual.
6218093	6223483	And as far as the last show goes, we're not ones to pull a lot of stunts.
6225303	6231276	I think you can expect it will be as you've come to expect right up until the very end.
6232679	6235084	But yeah, I'm open to all ideas.
6235104	6236467	We have a few weeks to figure it out.
6239213	6239594	All right.
6240616	6242601	Thanks for the dollar, Fifth Dream.
6242621	6242721	Yeah.
6243342	6272185	um with that um I know that's a heavy beast of information but you know hopefully everybody has some time to process we can talk about a little more next week if you want um and you know through these last few weeks I imagine we may see a few uh faces from the past pulling through one more time um and uh yeah um Matt I'll check in quickly see if there's any last minute stories but otherwise I think that's probably a good note for us to just exit stage right on um
6273008	6273388	All right.
6274029	6278095	Then why do I go around and say, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
6278555	6281119	Thank you for your support over the last few years.
6281199	6283782	I usually had a spiel here at the end.
6283822	6288648	I think that spiel is going to change a little bit here towards the end and just say- So long and thanks for all the fish.
6288788	6294856	No, truly, thank you for all your support over these last 23 and a half years and over a thousand episodes.
6295097	6296959	You all have kept us going.
6297680	6297700	I
6297680	6298862	I'm going to be honest.
6299042	6305473	When I thought there was no gas in the tank, you all were the reasons the show still kept going as long as it has.
6306014	6309960	This world record run was not achievable without you all.
6309980	6312023	So thank you so much for your support over the years.
6312043	6313085	It means everything to us.
6313626	6318474	And we'll be here at VOG Network every Sunday night throughout the 23rd of November, minus that one exception I talked about.
6319395	6320798	So thank you all so much.
6320818	6321499	And we hope to see you.
6321519	6324784	We hope you'll see this out to the bitter end with us.
6324764	6327790	So with that, DarkSakura, your final thought.
6328732	6330094	I don't think the end's going to be bitter.
6331918	6332519	I don't think so.
6332599	6334363	I think it's going to be tart.
6335225	6343360	There has to be waffles involved and maybe some booze and a lot of saying fuck.
6343380	6343681	P.S.
6343761	6344523	I ordered Malort.
6344583	6345705	Pray for me.
6345725	6346166	Oh, my God.
6346186	6347228	Have you ever had Malort?
6348001	6354554	No, apparently it tastes like stomach acid and a million years of regret.
6354575	6360787	The Chicago Ingress players make it a big fucking deal at all the events that if you haven't been malorted, you've got to.
6360807	6362090	So I've had my share of malort.
6362491	6363874	And here's the thing.
6363894	6365517	I'm saving it for something.
6365537	6367000	It's the Beverly of alcohol.
6369305	6369385	Hmm.
6370563	6371204	That's what I've got.
6371624	6374889	Well, I'm saving it for something post-TwitchCon.
6375270	6375510	Okay.
6375650	6376071	Fair enough.
6376151	6376832	Fair enough.
6376852	6377633	All right.
6377993	6379776	Well, if you're streaming tonight, we'll see you in a little bit then.
6379916	6380056	Yes?
6380116	6380797	I am.
6380817	6381598	It's Pallia night.
6381678	6385684	I figured we need some Pallia tonight instead of the Debbies.
6385704	6389469	We're going to go for cozy.
6390270	6392613	And I might cry in my stream.
6392974	6393314	We'll see.
6394356	6394756	Oh, my God.
6394796	6396098	Sean has an excellent question.
6396178	6399523	What's going to happen to the voiceover guy in the beginning of the show?
6400786	6402609	That's a great question.
6402729	6409479	Jason would love for you to... Wherever there is voiceover work needed... Do you want to be our voiceover guy?
6411462	6415128	I would say if ever I have voiceover needs, Jason will still be the first guy I call.
6415829	6417792	That's my quick answer to that question.
6417892	6425443	But I will save some of this for when we're ready to be done on the final night.
6425423	6452595	you wouldn't have had this show for a thousand of these 1064 episodes if it wasn't for Jason and I know he's not visible on this show as much there was a stretch there where we had a lot of Jason on this show which was great but trust you may not hear him outside those voiceovers at the beginning and the end there would be no OLR if it wasn't for Jason this entire time so one of the biggest thank yous in the room goes to VXJasonXV so
6453065	6476676	he's got a we gave him a spoon so he can dig his way out of the basement, fifth stream fifth stream said let him out of the basement before you go alright Jamie, go start your stream before we get out too much of the final final stuff when we're not ready yet, bye alright, Loki, we're going to you your final thought tonight speaking of bittersweet Tron Ares week
