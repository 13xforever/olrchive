1
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: A new Battlefield is out, and like every game, but especially AAA titles, crashes, long queues, and all the woes of critical mass combine to make the experience unpleasant, to put it mildly.

2
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:28,837
[SPEAKER_04]: With developer Dice Studios' name on the screen and back in the news, I would like to extend sympathy to my former colleague, Dice Ori, for once again having to deal with the influx of tweets he's getting with people shaming him for problems he has absolutely nothing to do with.

3
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:30,999
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the intro that's mostly about me and Dice.

4
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this story in the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, we're every gamer and voice.

6
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:41,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:46,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live tonight, October the 12th of 2025, with episode number 1065 of our show.

9
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:06,898
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, and thanks to our voiceover guy, Jason, at the top of the show, issuing out condolences on behalf of the show for social media interactions.

10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,438
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I love it.

11
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:07,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

12
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:15,127
[SPEAKER_07]: But joining us here live for our program tonight, all of you on Twitch as we are recording live.

13
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:19,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, my co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:20,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

15
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:20,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

16
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:21,433
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

17
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:22,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all right.

18
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:24,757
[SPEAKER_07]: TwitchCon's next week.

19
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got to be exciting.

20
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:29,502
[SPEAKER_01]: No, TwitchCon is this week.

21
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: This, well, okay, fine.

22
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:33,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending on, yeah, I guess if your calendar starts on Sunday, it's this week.

23
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, is it exciting or not?

24
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I have too much to get done before then to be excited.

25
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:44,932
[SPEAKER_01]: I will process that emotion when the time comes.

26
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:51,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I thought I had it in my head that I would go to the pharmacy today, not realizing the pharmacy was closed.

27
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:56,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I drove out there, but I did find that I've gone down a jean size.

28
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:56,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good.

29
00:01:57,206 --> 00:01:59,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey, that works.

30
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,091
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you looking forward to the most at TwitchCon?

31
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragshow.

32
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm going to do some of the painting stuff, like the Bob Ross stuff.

33
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

34
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:22,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other tools to grow my channel and keep going apace, I reckon.

35
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Disneyland.

36
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Disneyland.

37
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:28,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little sad I'm not going this weekend.

38
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:32,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would have been a lot of fun, but there's just a lot of other stuff going on.

39
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So probably my biggest show of the year happens to be this weekend on my other stuff.

40
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:37,857
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm still a little bummed.

41
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been great to see people, and I'm sure their drag show is going to kick ass, but they should be streaming that online, right?

42
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:44,785
[SPEAKER_07]: They usually do.

43
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:46,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be surprised if they didn't.

44
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not doing the stupid party.

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,973
[SPEAKER_07]: What even is the after party this year?

46
00:02:53,219 --> 00:03:20,070
[SPEAKER_01]: some stupid party it's the same as last year the TwitchCon party I'm planning on going to a gathering of streamers since I get more information about it and I think I might go to one of the drag shows like the one that dragged Trashly like over in Hillcrest or wherever they're doing it well have fun, have a lot of fun also say hello to TechMasterLoki

47
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:21,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I was going.

48
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going.

49
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:22,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

50
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a bummer to not be going.

51
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I already went to San Diego.

52
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:26,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,362
[SPEAKER_07]: You went to San Diego on a personal trip earlier this year.

54
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:40,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I see playing behind you on Twitch because, of course, we do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific.

55
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:45,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to address the elephant in the room, yes, we did announce on last week's show there are six episodes left.

56
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Episode number 1070 will

57
00:03:48,046 --> 00:04:03,068
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

58
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:10,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we hope you guys will join us here live for these last run of episodes.

59
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't talk a lot about last week.

60
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:13,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Loki, but I should bring this up.

61
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:28,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't talk a lot about it last week, but one factor that also kind of played into this decision was some things of a technical nature behind the scenes, namely that the website and web host that has been so graciously donated to us,

62
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much since the beginning of this thing is being scaled back pretty significantly.

63
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:40,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was going to be a lot of work involved to kind of change it over and keep it going and so forth.

64
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:46,369
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that was another one of those reasons on the table that was like, maybe this is just a sign that it's time.

65
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:56,140
[SPEAKER_07]: However, thanks to the hard work of Jason, who has helped us out with so many of these things for so long, there will still be...

66
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Like an archive type of presence.

67
00:04:58,587 --> 00:05:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to be confused with the OL Archive like Dark Tetsuya and some of the fans put together.

68
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:03,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that.

69
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:04,785
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to have every episode in it.

70
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But it will still allow you to access...

71
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,101
[SPEAKER_07]: A variety of episodes.

72
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:13,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver, but a variety of episodes from the archive.

73
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the OL archive that Dark Tooth Studio put together will still be out there.

74
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:19,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of these episodes are on YouTube.

75
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:24,698
[SPEAKER_07]: There will still be ways, if you want to kind of experience the show's legacy, to be able to do that.

76
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:33,349
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we decide to do the occasional reunion for a special occasion type of thing...

77
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,293
[SPEAKER_07]: There will need to be a place to put that.

78
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:40,463
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jason, again, will be helping us with all those things behind the scenes.

79
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:46,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So but more to come on all of that as we figure that out over the coming weeks.

80
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:50,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry, Loki, but you have a game playing behind you.

81
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:54,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And this looks like a Tron game that was on the Game Boy Advance.

82
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:55,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

83
00:05:56,043 --> 00:06:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: yes it's Tron 2.0 killer app that came out in 2004 but it is the Game Boy Advance version because I realized that I have almost run out of Tron games in place behind me that I haven't done before but I haven't done this version and it looks different yeah I never played the Game Boy Advance one I didn't even realize it was like a first person kind of game I'm going to be honest it doesn't look very good but maybe when you're in it they did their best that's right

84
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they got, yeah.

85
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:29,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So you went and saw the new Tron movie, right?

86
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:30,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

87
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, I thought it was good.

88
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:33,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

89
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a Tron fan, obviously, as evidenced by the cabinet behind me when we broadcast live, but I've had some reservations about this.

90
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,759
[SPEAKER_07]: But all the people I know that have gone to see it have enjoyed it and recommended it to me.

91
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:52,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm kind of now like, all right, I'm going to try to find some time this week to go see it, I guess.

92
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just suck it up as much as I hate that guy.

93
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,311
[SPEAKER_07]: He's good.

94
00:06:55,291 --> 00:07:20,860
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah well that's the thing so like Jared Leto like I know everyone's Leto adverse and that's fine um to to be that way honestly like his character Ares and I don't know this it is a dig at Leto it it literally could have been played by anybody anybody else the only reason that he is in this movie at all is because he's produced the movie and was the one kind of

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Pushing to get it made, I guess.

96
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:26,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But literally, you could have replaced him with

97
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:53,783
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody just literally anybody and it wouldn't have changed the movie at all he added nothing to to that that role you know and everybody's talking highly of the soundtrack as well which that part I never doubted because when I heard it like your Daft Punk broke up they're not getting back together so once you sort of accept that like it's not going to be Daft Punk and they have to find a worthy successor to Wendy Carlos and Daft Punk it's

98
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's good.

99
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:56,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't they get Gary Neumann?

100
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:02,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and if you look at it as a thing that it's like, you know, maybe they bring in a different artist.

101
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they'll ever make another movie after the box office for this one.

102
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:16,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if they bring a different, I feel like Nine Inch Nails, like, okay, yeah, that's going to be an artist that can put together some tunes that are, and not like emulate what those before did.

103
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,290
Yeah.

104
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also hearing that they did incorporate a couple of the pieces that Wendy Carlos did.

105
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:22,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

106
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think Daft Punk did, too, if I remember right.

107
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, yeah, you want to smile and nod, but be different.

108
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,726
[SPEAKER_07]: And that part I never doubted.

109
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the soundtrack was the part I was always the most excited for.

110
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,893
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also refused to listen to it until I see the movie.

111
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:37,594
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the rub.

112
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:38,215
Yeah.

113
00:08:38,195 --> 00:09:02,785
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'll see it I'll see it well yeah and the thing with the and I get it like you know I know with the previous soundtrack for Legacy there was a lot of like kind of themes that kept being incorporated into like different tracks but they all sounded very different whereas this soundtrack a lot of it sounds like the same song over and over again um which is not bad but it's just like

114
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:26,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know it it was good though in the movie like I had no problems with it in the movie I think the movie had a lot of potential like it feels like it would be better almost as like a TV show like with that's kind of that's what I wish that's what I wish they do with Tron I wish they do a more cheaply produced TV show and when I say cheaply produced you go back to some of the old school type of effects you

115
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:29,585
[SPEAKER_07]: that are going to be a lot cheaper to produce in this day and age.

116
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:34,871
[SPEAKER_07]: As 200 Matt points out, Tron Uprising, which was the anime, if I remember right, was good.

117
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:39,497
[SPEAKER_07]: They could keep the universe going with a good, well-produced animated show.

118
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:40,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree.

119
00:09:40,738 --> 00:09:45,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see it maybe take either an animated form or a cheaply produced Disney Plus series.

120
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,448
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

121
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:49,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was good.

122
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, it was alright.

123
00:09:51,819 --> 00:10:00,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I am disappointed that not really any of the characters from Legacy are back, except for a hint at the end for sequel bait, but...

124
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:23,110
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever I mean it's fine like I like the idea of exploring like a different different sections of the world and stuff like that in the universe and everything and even though there were some things it's like okay we've just kind of invented this MacGuffin for this movie but okay I'm sure that this is a thing now but overall I thought it was good I liked it

125
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:50,430
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'd say like one of the things I know with folks that are seeing it there might be a little bit of disappointment because if you think about it when you went to see Tron Legacy the difference like basically all of the unexpected things happening because what you expected in the original Tron movie versus like the newer tech and stuff like there's a lot of kind of surprising moments and stuff and seeing where they're taking this whereas um

126
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:06,748
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

127
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of this whole AI stuff where they try to tie it into AI.

128
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,619
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really work, but I don't know.

129
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:16,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I enjoyed it.

130
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was fine.

131
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:21,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hate... Leto didn't ruin the movie for me.

132
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Leto really, like I said, the character...

133
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:44,127
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

134
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:48,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's get into some kickoff news topics tonight.

135
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about what is going on in gaming news.

136
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:56,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off with one that's a little more in a rumor state, but I think there's some smoke here.

137
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:56,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

138
00:11:56,907 --> 00:12:02,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to do some of my own independent research that I do think something's going on with this.

139
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you want to talk about this?

140
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I pulled this story.

141
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:05,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to talk about this?

142
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:05,963
Sure.

143
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:17,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, so there's rumors that other retailers aside from Costco are going to be pulling Xbox stock, mentioning Target and Walmart.

144
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to tell you right now, just based off of what, you know, I used to go to Target like every single week when I take my kids or my son to his programming class.

145
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:27,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I've since stopped since like June.

146
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:31,900
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we were there, they never really had...

147
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:51,998
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX Hardware

148
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Before they even discussed hardware.

149
00:12:53,921 --> 00:13:09,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were already, as it is, I think outside of maybe the Switch and Switch 2, have stripped most of the physical media from the gaming section because it's just not selling as well.

150
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:40,108
[SPEAKER_05]: and so you have on top of that these consoles that yeah it gets people into the store to buy other things but I'm assuming that these consoles are very similar to consoles back when I was selling video games to you know game stores and stuff like that there's no margin on them they're essentially sold at a loss and so it doesn't make sense when you have these prices going up and up and up you know why is like a Target or something like that going to bring in an $800 console and risk

151
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:45,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Selling, like not selling that you're sitting on this expensive hardware that, you know, may not sell.

152
00:13:46,156 --> 00:14:06,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get it if that they're, you know, removing and really, they're not necessarily taking it out from they're taking out the physical stores, but they're still probably gonna sell it out of a warehouse or online, you know, maybe that's the other thing is a lot of people are not going into stores to purchase stuff like this, but they're just shopping online, getting it delivered for free to their house.

153
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:10,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think, you know, we got to see some hard figures to really say for sure.

154
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:17,058
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can't imagine that now that an Xbox Series X costs like $800 because of tariffs and the price increases.

155
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:20,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I cannot imagine these are flying off shelves the way they used to.

156
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:21,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I really can't.

157
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:28,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's important to say with this, too, that this is all being sourced from Reddit rumors, which you'll obviously take it with a grain of salt.

158
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:30,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is multiple people on Reddit.

159
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:46,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Target, Target, Target

160
00:14:46,762 --> 00:15:07,636
[SPEAKER_07]: and their website and you search for, so I'm searching for a pretty big Target store on the south side of town, search for Xbox Series and filter it to the actual game consoles, you see that they have a Series S, they have the two Series S's there, the one that's one terabyte and the other one's 512 gig, but you don't see the Series X anywhere in here.

161
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And then here's the big one.

162
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:12,043
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually filter this, shop in store,

163
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,103
[SPEAKER_07]: A PlayStation is your first result now.

164
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,166
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have any Xboxes that are available in stores.

165
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:21,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And even if it's, you know, okay, change the store, do a different one in the area.

166
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'll pick another big store in the area.

167
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's the one over on 65th.

168
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:26,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, that one's empty.

169
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:28,178
[SPEAKER_07]: The Midtown one's a small store anyway.

170
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Arden, that's a pretty big store too.

171
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, empty.

172
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:35,928
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get an Xbox console in the store.

173
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where I'm kind of like, all right,

174
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:43,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely believe something's up with Microsoft's presence in the store.

175
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:52,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Walmart, on the other hand, if you search them, you can still find in store that they actually do have the X listed.

176
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:58,951
[SPEAKER_07]: The version with the smaller drive is still there, and you can go pick that up in the store.

177
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:05,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little less that Walmart has phased it out, at least right now, right this minute, but it does appear Target...

178
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,519
[SPEAKER_07]: is scaling way back on it.

179
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:12,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, if you think about it, I don't think they have any big holiday games coming.

180
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Their consoles just went up in price.

181
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Their online service is going up in price.

182
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:25,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really sounding like a good year to... I mean, if anything, it'd be a good year to purchase a Switch 2 or something like that, because I think that would be a lot hotter.

183
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:28,568
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got bigger games coming out for that this holiday.

184
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:33,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got... I don't know what's necessarily coming out on the Sony camp, but...

185
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:46,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's maybe not a good year to purchase console hardware, especially when you have, you know, Microsoft kind of flailing about right now with what their strategy is with this and how they're going to go forward.

186
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:53,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I don't know, it might be better holding off or just doing something else.

187
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:57,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like, I mean, like, this is a terrible year to buy an Xbox.

188
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody knows the price of that has been artificially inflated and it's not Microsoft's fault.

189
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:13,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks that this whole situation could... I mean, I don't know.

190
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:17,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm being dramatic, but it could kill Microsoft's hardware business.

191
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:24,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, maybe they come back once this tariff thing finally gets shut down, if it ever does.

192
00:17:25,383 --> 00:17:27,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, Congress could end this tomorrow.

193
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:47,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're playing Tic-Tac-Toe instead.

194
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,340
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's balancing our checkbooks.

195
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,841
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

196
00:17:50,722 --> 00:18:01,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I, you know, maybe Microsoft can enter the hardware game again in a few years when, you know, it's not economic, you know, ridiculous to do it.

197
00:18:02,004 --> 00:18:06,733
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just I really feel like this is the beginning of the end for the Xbox series.

198
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:23,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

199
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, are these kids, let's assume that, I mean, I don't know if they're going to be buying PCs or whatever, but imagine getting your kids a PC or something because it's just like, oh man, these console games are too expensive.

200
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:37,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

201
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:42,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait till they find out, oh wait, I can play PlayStation games and Xbox games on this PC?

202
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait, what am I doing?

203
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:48,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Why am I buying a console then?

204
00:18:49,559 --> 00:19:18,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know I don't know how Microsoft fixes this mess because two weeks ago I would have said if this had been a story two weeks ago I would have said well Microsoft needs to lean into Game Pass hard they need to commit to their every place is an Xbox strategy and they need to run with it and then well they shot that in the foot last week didn't they by upping the price of Game Pass and now everybody wants to get rid of that boy oh boy so I don't know what to tell Microsoft at this point besides you're fucked

205
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that they would listen.

206
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, they don't care.

207
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:31,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But Forza Horizon, hey, I'm still excited for Forza Horizon 6, but I don't think it's going to save Xbox gaming right now.

208
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:42,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also worry about stuff like that, too, because you look at what they're doing even just with their operating system stuff and how they're really just not listening to the consumer whatsoever.

209
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,551
[SPEAKER_05]: They're throwing in advertisements everywhere.

210
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:47,355
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to monetize whatever they can from that stuff.

211
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:55,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's going to carry on through to more things as time goes on.

212
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:55,206
Yeah.

213
00:19:56,587 --> 00:20:02,952
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, but that Xbox price hike might not apply to everybody, right, Loki?

214
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:10,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, it's not like what it's, you know, it's not as good of news as you think it would be.

215
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But certain regions apparently are not getting the price hike on November 4th.

216
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only a few countries, though.

217
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:28,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And so right now it's, you know, places like Poland and Korea will remain in the normal lower monthly price thing at the end.

218
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:43,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, India, and Austria So they're not going to see the price hike But everyone else still will

219
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:49,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Some comments from chat I want to get to because, of course, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

220
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:54,980
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S says, as long as Microsoft sells gaming software, there will always be an Xbox.

221
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not make sense for the company to promote its software on another device.

222
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,126
[SPEAKER_07]: The company promoting Game Pass on other hardware is a desperation tactic.

223
00:21:02,507 --> 00:21:04,428
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are promoting on other devices.

224
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,030
[SPEAKER_07]: They're promoting on PlayStation.

225
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,673
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, you know, the big announcement at Tokyo Game Show with Forza Horizon and stuff.

226
00:21:09,693 --> 00:21:12,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that part of your comment is a little misguided.

227
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:14,097
[SPEAKER_07]: However...

228
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:23,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I do agree that as Sega still exists, even in the lack of hardware world, making some pretty darn good games, honestly, that are really appreciated.

229
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:32,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Microsoft owns enough game studios, including the Activisions and Blizzards and Bethesda's.

230
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,820
[SPEAKER_07]: God, they have an awful lot, don't they?

231
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:37,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think Microsoft has enough gaming studios that...

232
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft as a game maker can make Windows games, if nothing else, and still have enough of a niche and a space.

233
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:48,660
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the Microsoft looks very different.

234
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to look very different if there is no Xbox hardware business.

235
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe, maybe that's not a bad thing.

236
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe having Microsoft having to focus in a

237
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,897
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe ends up being a good thing.

238
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want the Xbox to go away.

239
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:04,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not cheering this.

240
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:12,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just accepting the reality that because of what the government did, that Microsoft is kind of fucked in multiple directions.

241
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:18,614
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, like less competition means, you know, a worse environment for us consumers.

242
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:28,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's, I'd rather see them still succeed because otherwise if they're not around, then Sony is not really pushed to innovate.

243
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:29,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

244
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:47,989
[SPEAKER_05]: and the same would be with like Microsoft even if Microsoft or Sony went away then Microsoft wouldn't be pushed to innovate so you need to have that competition or to drive prices down to you know push innovation and do unique things otherwise they're going to get very complacent

245
00:22:48,577 --> 00:23:18,567
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says,

246
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,490
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't.

247
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:44,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't.

248
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reality we may have to accept, at least on the Nintendo and Sony front.

249
00:23:49,577 --> 00:23:55,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But Xbox is going to have it a little harder because Xbox never did get Japan.

250
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:57,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So they only have the US and Europe.

251
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So the US is going to have a lot more on what the future holds for Microsoft.

252
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:13,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what you might see, to give an extremely long answer to your question, I think you may see for the first time, well, not the first time, but...

253
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:41,305
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to see Microsoft and Sony release in different years which technically has happened before but I think you're going to feel it like you're going to notice they're not releasing in tandem and that could be very interesting because in that case Microsoft's going to be the one that feels like they're playing catch up because the games developed, especially in Japan they're all going to be with PlayStation in mind they're not going to be any better for Microsoft no matter what the specs are

254
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:48,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're going to get developers, especially if they're not selling on those consoles, they're just not going to even develop with Xbox in mind.

255
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,143
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be like, well, I'll put it on PC.

256
00:24:50,304 --> 00:24:51,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That takes care of

257
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:52,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people.

258
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:54,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And then PlayStation.

259
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:58,614
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said this on last week's show, and I'll say it again.

260
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:04,219
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are one of those people that says keep politics out of gaming, it is too late.

261
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad.

262
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what is happening to Microsoft is directly because of political.

263
00:25:09,663 --> 00:25:16,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can brain worm your way into whatever, but that's the fact.

264
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:19,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is an Xbox as expensive as it is?

265
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the political climate.

266
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to say you can you can believe it's a good thing or a bad thing.

267
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:26,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

268
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:26,878
[SPEAKER_07]: That's I'm not going to.

269
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:34,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm just going to say that this whole retail and now it's not on the shelves can be directly related to what's going on politically.

270
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:40,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think those prices are going to go down to pre-tariff prices after the tariffs go away.

271
00:25:40,316 --> 00:25:40,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.

272
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:42,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, they got time.

273
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:43,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You're sorely mistaken.

274
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

275
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:45,042
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

276
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:46,603
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

277
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:55,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with that in mind, I think a lot of us are playing the games we already have or going to our backlog, maybe discovering some new things, but we'll find out in our gaming week.

278
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:57,593
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

279
00:25:58,914 --> 00:25:59,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It was painful.

280
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my hand hurts.

281
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:06,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

282
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:07,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, yeah.

283
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear it.

284
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:09,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sorry.

285
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:13,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just really quiet.

286
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,068
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know you're streaming.

287
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:14,488
Yeah.

288
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:19,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for short periods of time, I really couldn't go very long.

289
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:32,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard the, I'm trying to describe it in non-medical terms, but it's the fifth metacarpal distal end on my right hand.

290
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:38,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bone under my pinky finger, the top part of it,

291
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:43,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what happened, but my x-ray came back all clear.

292
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:48,980
[SPEAKER_01]: No arthritis, no inflammation, no dislocation, no broken.

293
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:57,157
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still hurts quite a bit, especially after I've played for a while or done things for a while or let it hit idle for a while.

294
00:26:57,197 --> 00:26:58,920
[SPEAKER_01]: It just comes and goes, really.

295
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:23,794
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I've been able to play like maybe an hour of Dead by Daylight at a time and then an hour of something else at a time and I'm fine if I remember to keep my hands up while I play but I'm using compression glove and I still have to get through that Dead by Daylight challenge before I leave so I can get the stuff for it so whatever

296
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:35,224
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I also played some Nocturne in the Moonlight last night and played some Palia and just the usual.

297
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:42,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we go to Loki, I wanted to give you space to if you wanted to promote the GoFundMe you've been promoting.

298
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:43,499
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

299
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:58,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my dearest, longest friends ever, Gwen, who we know in chat as either Finara or Loony Bard, is in a pretty dire situation.

300
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:06,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's been suffering for a while after losing her job and losing her folks and

301
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:08,267
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of stuff going on.

302
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:13,477
[SPEAKER_01]: But now her power has been shut off and they said that she owes like $400.

303
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:17,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like just to turn it back on.

304
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,185
[SPEAKER_01]: She owes a lot more.

305
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:23,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've started a GoFundMe and my immediate...

306
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:32,530
[SPEAKER_01]: My immediate request is to at least get 450 up, which would be able to get her power turned back on.

307
00:28:32,891 --> 00:28:43,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought her a solar battery that, of course, with it getting cooler weather in upstate New York, you know, thanks, SSJ100, I was about to post it.

308
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:46,633
[SPEAKER_01]: It's...

309
00:28:47,373 --> 00:29:09,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna get colder and she's got three cats and, you know, I just don't want her to be going into colder weather without any means of being able to, you know, cook food or stay warm or charge her phone and stay in contact with people because she's there by herself.

310
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:15,075
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean I hope she doesn't mind me going a little bit into the situation.

311
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:18,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not going into all of the situation but it's pretty dire.

312
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:26,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only raised $75 out of $450 and that's

313
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:53,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm waiting on a payment for my hosting this weekend, but I'll chip in a little percentage of that.

314
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:54,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

315
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:55,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

316
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:55,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

317
00:29:56,451 --> 00:30:07,192
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can just get that amount to get her power turned back on, that right there would be amazing.

318
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:16,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, I mean, in the meantime, I think the solar battery might just be enough to keep her phone charged.

319
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:25,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But people, especially with the way things are and how hard it is for people to get jobs, and she doesn't have any transportation either.

320
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:26,843
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really dire situation.

321
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:40,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if I knew someone who would be able just to go up and help her out with things around the house or anything, I would be really grateful.

322
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the time being, this is what we can do.

323
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:46,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thank you.

324
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

325
00:30:48,552 --> 00:30:53,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and when you do it, just give a big F you to you know who while you do it.

326
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:57,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this also would be something that that piece of shit would never do.

327
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:02,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Would never reach out to help somebody.

328
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:03,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

329
00:31:03,143 --> 00:31:05,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's get back to our gaming weeks.

330
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:06,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Renari.

331
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:35,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

332
00:31:35,752 --> 00:31:43,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got an event, my current event thing that I'm actually doing on November 2nd, which is also a Sunday.

333
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:48,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll probably be posting something on Blue Sky for that.

334
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:55,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I retweeted it on X, but yeah, it's a charity event for...

335
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let's see.

336
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the podcasts.

337
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:03,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Our friend Orbitz does that.

338
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:08,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's something that they're starting to partner with this.

339
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Clix or Crix.

340
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty fun event.

341
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm on a team of four.

342
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:21,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be doing parkour and PvP and all that fun stuff that I'm not good at.

343
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:22,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait.

344
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,587
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically it.

345
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:28,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, have fun with that.

346
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

347
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:31,873
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week.

348
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:36,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing a little bit more of the Final Fantasy Tactics, of course.

349
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Always playing too much of my mobile games.

350
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I did Pokemon Go Community Day today.

351
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:43,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught like 15 of those... Solosis?

352
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember the name of the thing.

353
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:46,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught like...

354
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:49,222
[SPEAKER_07]: 14 of them on like a three mile walk.

355
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:51,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, I'm never going to know what to do with these.

356
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:56,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, Matt, if I ever see you again in person, you can have like seven from my cow.

357
00:32:56,377 --> 00:32:58,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need 14 shinies.

358
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:00,625
[SPEAKER_07]: What, Pokemon Go?

359
00:33:01,527 --> 00:33:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't play Pokemon Go anymore.

360
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:04,934
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not you, Matt.

361
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:05,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, in chat.

362
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:05,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

363
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotcha.

364
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,918
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 Matt said, I got zero shinies.

365
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:11,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my wife caught a bunch, so I'm good.

366
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:12,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's good.

367
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:19,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just, I actually found a place not downtown that has, you know how like Pokemon, well, I'll tell you what it is.

368
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all based on where XM spawns in Ingress.

369
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:28,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, just, you know, having played all the games for a while, XM spawns in Ingress are very similar to how Pokemon spawns.

370
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:34,993
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you find the places that are dense in XM, which I believe was based on some sort of like cellular estimate.

371
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was like cellular traffic.

372
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's always like clustered in strip malls and on the road and things like that.

373
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's why it is set up the way it is because I found a place.

374
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:46,824
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.

375
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:52,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a walking path right near power lines and it's just full of Pokemon.

376
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:57,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So I played Community Day there with my Bluetooth just nonstop.

377
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran out of Pokeballs.

378
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran out of space.

379
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:04,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's probably why I have a lot.

380
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:26,884
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

381
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,849
[SPEAKER_07]: I logged into my PlayStation to play Final Fantasy Tactics.

382
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:32,192
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know who I saw playing Diablo 4?

383
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:36,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Grandpa from Horde House playing Diablo 4.

384
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:38,141
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like... I actually texted him.

385
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, bitch, you played Diablo 4 and you didn't tell me.

386
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,047
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's like, yeah, I'm playing this season.

387
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, ah, fuck.

388
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I gotta start a seasonal character so we can play together.

389
00:34:45,913 --> 00:34:46,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did.

390
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to...

391
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,108
[SPEAKER_07]: like Torment 1.

392
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:53,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm already max level and I didn't get power level.

393
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

394
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:58,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that it matters, but I worked my little Diablo tail off and did it.

395
00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:04,541
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm playing a Hydra, not like Hail Hydra, but like Hydra heads.

396
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:06,943
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a move that sorceresses use.

397
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:08,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and I love my sorceress.

398
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:09,965
[SPEAKER_07]: She's so hot.

399
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hit the rant.

400
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,848
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how I make my characters now.

401
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:15,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hit the random button until it's like, ooh, that one's hot.

402
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got a hot sorceress and yeah.

403
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:41,877
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:35:41,857 --> 00:36:02,413
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

405
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:28,536
[SPEAKER_07]: um look at this mega evolution look at this mega evolution like all the spoilers I don't really care like I'm like it's just what they look like it's not gonna change the way I play the game but it's just like otherwise as far as like the live battle system and stuff I haven't really been ODing on all the information out there so I'm excited to just absorb it so um I might do a stream when it unlocks Wednesday night um maybe

406
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:32,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, MikeDev says, yeah, I don't mind forum spoilers.

407
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,043
[SPEAKER_07]: SJ100Matt says, so did you decide on your starter, Rob?

408
00:36:35,423 --> 00:36:38,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, and I'm going to be honest, and I'm going to get hate for this, and I don't care.

409
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:43,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not big on any of the starters that they picked, to be honest, for this one.

410
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:48,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to go with Tepig, because Piggy.

411
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, and that's it.

412
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it, Piggy.

413
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:51,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like Emboar.

414
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Emboar's kind of a cool Pokemon.

415
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:54,743
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going with Tepig.

416
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:58,967
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get into some more gaming news.

417
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:00,228
[SPEAKER_07]: We got some for you.

418
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:02,692
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, let's go with our first story.

419
00:37:03,893 --> 00:37:10,462
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and, you know, it's a week, so we have Nintendo filing lawsuits.

420
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:16,991
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes a little bit more sense, though, rather than, you know, filing lawsuits with random people about stuff.

421
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:23,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about the Reddit moderator for Switch Pirates, but that's okay.

422
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only were they a moderator, they were also a Switch pirate, and they ran multiple pirate websites.

423
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:40,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It's less about them moderating a forum and them running the actual Switch websites, or piracy websites, which is what they were involved in.

424
00:37:41,278 --> 00:37:48,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is demanding $4.5 million in a default ruling because they apparently did not show up.

425
00:37:49,246 --> 00:38:18,544
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah and apparently uh they also have to obviously uh stop running those websites but yeah i don't know uh it makes sense to me so stomp out that piracy i guess does it feel like don't run it does does it feel like the reddit user oh sorry i was gonna say maybe don't run a a uh piracy ring completely out in the open like this like i would think i don't know um

426
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:34,660
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

427
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:40,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we'll never figure out if piracy is not a gray area unless someone actually fights it in court.

428
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't expect this guy to do it.

429
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:47,086
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right, but I don't expect this guy to do it.

430
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:54,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like this guy's just kind of treating it like the letters from the collector where it's like, I'll just ignore it.

431
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:54,960
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they going to do?

432
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,923
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't get money out of somebody that doesn't have it.

433
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I really feel like that's what this person is responding to.

434
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:07,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, like, how can you prove that all these, like, pirating all these works?

435
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:24,216
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is why, okay, so, in one sense, yes, I think it's just, but in the other sense, like, we have, like, open AI just literally pirating all of the things and just be like, we cool, we need to pirate all the things to run our business.

436
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:24,897
Yeah.

437
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You like business, right?

438
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:32,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we can't beat China unless we break all the rules and steal all the things.

439
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's exactly what some of these countries do.

440
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:40,247
[SPEAKER_07]: You bring me to a very interesting thought that was my reaction.

441
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:46,614
[SPEAKER_07]: My honest-to-God reaction when I first read what this guy was doing and why, you know, he's just like, whatever, not even, like, bothering to fight it.

442
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:51,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, maybe I'll get cancelled for this opinion, but I don't give a fuck.

443
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,319
[SPEAKER_07]: We got six episodes left.

444
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:52,860
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you gonna do?

445
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:55,002
Like...

446
00:39:54,982 --> 00:40:02,526
[SPEAKER_07]: My honest thing is that I think in our current political climate there's no accountability.

447
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:06,679
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a person at the very, very, very top

448
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:09,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Who ignores things that come from the courts?

449
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's no accountability, what's going to happen?

450
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:14,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's going to hold this guy accountable?

451
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody.

452
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:21,787
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this guy probably gets emboldened a little bit like that.

453
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:25,091
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not going to be accountability.

454
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo's never going to see a dime.

455
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,175
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't the world we live in.

456
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:30,338
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't live in an accountable society.

457
00:40:30,537 --> 00:40:32,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo's never going to see a dime.

458
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:45,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really, you know, again, I don't know this guy, whatever, but I'm just gonna say I would not be surprised to see more of this because that is, again, kind of that political world we live in.

459
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:56,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking for a chat to QuestBuster says, not just Pirate, but apparently from what I've read elsewhere, the accused was also charging for premium access to certain ROM sites.

460
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Always putting that, you know, getting money for it is always a huge no-no.

461
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:08,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Fifth Dream says the way they got around it is people paid them $5 in eShop cards for access to the downloads, which they supposedly used to buy the games.

462
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:11,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, it wasn't money.

463
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:11,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So I...

464
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:23,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, to your point, Loki, what you were just saying about AI is another excellent example of how there's no accountability.

465
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:26,506
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go to AI and say, make me Mickey Mouse, make me Shrek.

466
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I was training my AI on your content.

467
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:30,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm free to go.

468
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:31,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

469
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:33,838
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing that's going to stop.

470
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:37,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now in this world as it is.

471
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:43,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying it's right, but I'm just saying how did we get here?

472
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:45,612
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how.

473
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

474
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

475
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:53,533
[SPEAKER_07]: To be continued.

476
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be interested to see if Nintendo makes a dime off this.

477
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:58,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's be clear.

478
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, piracy is wrong.

479
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:07,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, it's not... Like, the Supreme Court is not going to say, sure, you can have this piracy thing.

480
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wrong.

481
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:16,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like Hollywood's going to come after people that are selling pirate Blu-rays and DVDs of, like... It's going to happen.

482
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,063
[SPEAKER_07]: But, of course, we all know in other countries...

483
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:26,320
[SPEAKER_07]: where Hollywood doesn't have as firm of a grip they can't really stop what's being sold on the streets

484
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:40,123
[SPEAKER_07]: All they can do is just try to make people feel bad about it.

485
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:49,860
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll just generate the next Tron Ares instead with AI because that's completely legal and they certainly haven't gotten in trouble with anything.

486
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:51,499
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not at all.

487
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:56,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yes, the Supreme Court would say it's wrong, but they haven't said it yet, so it doesn't legally count.

488
00:42:57,205 --> 00:43:00,930
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, again, my gut response to that was going to be, well, it's just a matter of time.

489
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:01,971
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to say it's wrong.

490
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm sitting here going, you know what?

491
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:07,618
[SPEAKER_07]: With this fucking clown car show in Washington right now, I don't know.

492
00:43:08,058 --> 00:43:09,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happens.

493
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it'll be a fun gamble.

494
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:12,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

495
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:14,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, again, if the AI companies can get away with it.

496
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't I?

497
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:24,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we just get a certain head of state addicted to playing pirated Switch 2 games and then it'll be completely legal for everybody, right?

498
00:43:25,443 --> 00:43:31,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just need those pirated games to say good things about the people running the government and it'll all be a free-for-all.

499
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:42,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, oh, what a great lead-in to the next story, because we have a story about AI usage.

500
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:45,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rin Mari in chat was like, uh-oh, did I bring up this story?

501
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,061
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of did.

502
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:48,983
[SPEAKER_07]: It was posted by DarkTitsuya.

503
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:49,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of your fault.

504
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,847
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of your fault, but I think it's a good one.

505
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:54,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't bring it up if I didn't think, like, wow, this is something we're talking about.

506
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:58,575
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, a shout-out for the Discord community, which...

507
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:05,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Which will stay up for the foreseeable future until Discord gets shut down, I guess, or we get kicked off it.

508
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:10,257
[SPEAKER_07]: VOGnetwork.com slash Discord if you want to continue to share news and talk about the news.

509
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:16,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is where Ranmari shared the story and then DarkTetsuya picked it up and was like, here's a source, you might want to talk about this on the show.

510
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:20,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And what basically happened was that there was a tweet.

511
00:44:20,134 --> 00:44:21,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it was also a Blue Sky post.

512
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:36,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, it was a Blue Sky post because I saw it on Blue Sky, where somebody at Taito took a black and white photo of Japanese players surrounding a Darius cabinet, and they ran it through generative AI to kind of clean the picture up.

513
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:51,225
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

514
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna see, let me see if I can actually find that post here on Blue Sky to kind of fall down this rabbit hole a little bit.

515
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:02,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm gonna show you and I'm gonna narrate best I can for those that are listening on the podcast.

516
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:07,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the other screen, I'm actually showing that post from VG Densetsu on Blue Sky.

517
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:12,069
[SPEAKER_07]: who actually links and quote posts the Taito.co.jp post.

518
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And this post actually reads, it's written in Japanese, but if you want to just use the rough Google translation, it's basically saying, hey, today is Darius release day.

519
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:25,268
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Darius was first on October 7th and 8th, 1986.

520
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,553
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically like, hey, Darius was released today.

521
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:57,763
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

522
00:45:57,743 --> 00:45:59,988
[SPEAKER_07]: This game that's being played is called WANDAS.

523
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,642
[SPEAKER_07]: This is generative AI that was failed to be quality checked.

524
00:46:05,742 --> 00:46:10,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And what VG Densetsu did was they actually said, this looks familiar.

525
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:14,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the original photo where you can see that the

526
00:46:14,163 --> 00:46:16,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Young looking gentleman in the front.

527
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, boy in the front really is what it looks like.

528
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:24,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see that Darius, you know, even though it's like obscured with lighting and stuff, you can see it's clear here.

529
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:30,990
[SPEAKER_07]: This black and white picture is what officially Taito and their official look back.

530
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:50,143
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

531
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:55,645
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to do something like this to look back, disclose it.

532
00:46:55,665 --> 00:47:03,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say, you know what, we thought we'd work with AI to show what this scene might look like today.

533
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:10,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure people will spit their tongue out at it and go, you know, but at least you would have disclosed it.

534
00:47:11,065 --> 00:47:11,646
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.

535
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite a few.

536
00:47:13,388 --> 00:47:15,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very obvious they used the AI.

537
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:18,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It erodes trust.

538
00:47:18,555 --> 00:47:23,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they could have paid somebody to colorize it or try to colorize it.

539
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:24,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

540
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,505
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those things true.

541
00:47:25,705 --> 00:47:29,591
[SPEAKER_07]: But instead, this is what they did and it erodes trust with the community.

542
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:33,216
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we supposed to look back and celebrate with you when it's fake?

543
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,419
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a fake celebration.

544
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:54,252
[SPEAKER_07]: if you want to do this just disclose it because then again then you can roll your eyes at it and go whatever but at least you're not being dishonest this is dishonest or show the original picture and this and say you know again we thought we'd work with AI to see what it would look like in this

545
00:47:54,383 --> 00:47:55,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just don't.

546
00:47:55,365 --> 00:47:57,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't show the original picture.

547
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great idea.

548
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:00,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't show the remake.

549
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:03,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Just show only the one.

550
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be like, here you go.

551
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:05,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It's black and white.

552
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:08,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what pictures used to look like.

553
00:48:08,795 --> 00:48:11,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, just something.

554
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,844
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need to explain themselves.

555
00:48:12,884 --> 00:48:15,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, okay, here's what we've got.

556
00:48:15,229 --> 00:48:15,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

557
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:16,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's celebrate it.

558
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:17,934
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need it being color.

559
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:21,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at chat, a lot of people yelling, Wayness.

560
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:23,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

561
00:48:23,546 --> 00:48:26,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reading the replies right now.

562
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,453
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious.

563
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:35,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I was waiting for Ted Turner to try to colorize the first 20 minutes of The Wizard of Oz.

564
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually legit for the 1930s.

565
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:49,880
[SPEAKER_07]: If you watch the behind the scenes of how they did that effect from when it went to black and white, although it was more of a sepia, like sepia to color, like the way they did that was actually amazing for the 1930s.

566
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,183
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I'm getting way off track.

567
00:48:52,163 --> 00:49:13,513
[SPEAKER_07]: um let's see um uh Quest Buster says I can't wait for Wayness to show up in a new collection I think that's a fear too I think that's a good thing that Taito's getting called out on because how long until Taito asks us to pay for a collection of retro games that has been enhanced with AI

568
00:49:14,506 --> 00:49:17,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, disclose it or have there be a choice.

569
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:22,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to play the original or would you like to play the AI enhanced version?

570
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:26,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even better, pay the people to do it by hand.

571
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:33,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're all foolish if we're sitting here going, surely the industry is not going to go this direction.

572
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:34,827
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to cut all sorts of corners.

573
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:36,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, of course they are.

574
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:43,818
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we've got to use our voices while we can, even when it's an issue, as simple as a fucking picture.

575
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:44,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the replies.

576
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you find any really good replies, DarkSakura?

577
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just quickly scrolling through.

578
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:51,809
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the ones in Japanese are just going, this is shameful.

579
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:56,435
[SPEAKER_01]: You are harming your history.

580
00:49:57,997 --> 00:49:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

581
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:06,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, let me... I found Rinmari's reply and I gave it a like from the OLR account that says, can't spell Taito without AI.

582
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:11,342
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this one?

583
00:50:14,224 --> 00:50:19,469
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that doesn't have anything to do with... There's a few of them on here.

584
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:22,471
[SPEAKER_01]: This may have been a mistake.

585
00:50:22,551 --> 00:50:29,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do not rewrite history by reconstructing by AI, one of the Japanese things.

586
00:50:29,532 --> 00:50:38,901
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

587
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe.

588
00:50:44,214 --> 00:51:05,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we have been seeing, uh, the staff, at least the original, uh, staff for Halo slowly trickling out, and we have, um, another person to that, uh, one of the art directors that worked on the series for 17 years.

589
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:05,749
Okay.

590
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:28,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

591
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:39,547
[SPEAKER_01]: He put a statement on his LinkedIn page that said he was leaving the developer now known as Halo Studios and said he would tell more in the future.

592
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:46,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just read what the post says, because I think it's very interesting in its entirety.

593
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:52,076
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, after 17 long years, I am officially no longer contributing to the Halo universe.

594
00:51:52,658 --> 00:52:00,801
[SPEAKER_01]: There is little more I can say for the moment, though I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it's absolutely safe to do so next year.

595
00:52:00,861 --> 00:52:02,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing NDA.

596
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:05,890
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, I have a message for anyone and everyone who needs to hear it.

597
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:11,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the state of our industry seems dire, but never forget that you are free to choose.

598
00:52:11,616 --> 00:52:20,586
[SPEAKER_01]: No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth treating away your health, your dignity, your ethics or values, and no one can force you to.

599
00:52:21,227 --> 00:52:25,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong.

600
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:30,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see where I take that jump and say AI?

601
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:33,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And Grant, I am completely making shit up.

602
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:38,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I know nothing about the inner stuff, but I can't help but read into that statement.

603
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

604
00:52:42,138 --> 00:52:42,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

605
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:48,204
[SPEAKER_07]: But it could be a few things, but just knowing where the industry has been going, I don't know.

606
00:52:49,605 --> 00:52:50,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a reasonable guess.

607
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,870
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been on there is the health and dignity.

608
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

609
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:00,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixed me think that that might also have something to do with crunch as well.

610
00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:02,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Could be, fair.

611
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:05,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe the working conditions just aren't great.

612
00:53:05,378 --> 00:53:09,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm definitely sure AI has a bit to go into it as well.

613
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:21,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, the game itself isn't really retaining the same player base they had before.

614
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:32,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's what, you know, with all the Xbox talk we did at the top of the show, I don't think like, oh, it's the Halo box really means as much as it used to.

615
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:35,597
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

616
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:36,499
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not really.

617
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Forza Horizon box now for me and many people.

618
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:43,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

619
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in my case, it's that I haven't given a shit about this box in a long time.

620
00:53:48,944 --> 00:54:07,881
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

621
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:11,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if you're posting it to Twitter.

622
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:14,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of Japanese folks are still on Twitter.

623
00:54:14,242 --> 00:54:31,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And DeviantArt put in a clause back in... It was around the time I got off of it, which was over a decade ago, that they could use your artwork for profitability.

624
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:32,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And that went right into AI.

625
00:54:32,672 --> 00:54:32,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

626
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:43,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure BlueSky and Mastodon both have like don't use us for AI type of things, at least depending on the Mastodon server probably.

627
00:54:43,496 --> 00:54:49,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, because both are public facing and posts are public, there really isn't anything to stop AI.

628
00:54:49,926 --> 00:54:53,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So you kind of have to be mindful of anything that you post publicly.

629
00:54:53,677 --> 00:54:54,959
[SPEAKER_07]: could.

630
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:20,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, maybe you post something like that to pursue legal action later on, but if you don't have the resources to pursue legal action, unfortunately, you're going to... That's why for once in my life, I'm cheering on the big Hollywood organizations like Disney and Universal and stuff that are taking these AI companies to task because these deviant art artists and other artists we've named so far don't have the resources to fight legally what AI is doing.

631
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:48,152
[SPEAKER_01]: a precedent needs to be established on what AI can and cannot train off of and it's Disney that's going to have to fight that at all that are going to have to fight that fight for us I'm just going to say there's been a big reason why instead of offering people digital art when I do like like for example for my subathon or something if I have you can win artwork for me there's a reason I'm not doing it digitally it is it is

632
00:55:49,297 --> 00:56:06,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Copic Marker or Paint and I deliver it to you in a physical form alright well let's move on and talk about the launch of a big game that people are playing on Xbox and other consoles right Loki?

633
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Battlefield 6 just launched.

634
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:12,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And as such, I was kind of curious to see how it would do.

635
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, a lot of people were really anticipating that game coming back.

636
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:18,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, it did very well.

637
00:56:18,148 --> 00:56:22,672
[SPEAKER_05]: 700,000 concurrent players on Steam.

638
00:56:23,433 --> 00:56:28,239
[SPEAKER_05]: At one time, there were some screenshots going around because there were some issues connecting to the game.

639
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,182
[SPEAKER_05]: They had 350,000 people in queue.

640
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:36,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a lot.

641
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:51,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with your typical launch with a lot of these games and all the different content packages that you have to download, there were some other issues with the game running, basically saying that you need to install some additional content that you may have already had installed.

642
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:53,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, DICE was looking into it.

643
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:53,643
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

644
00:56:53,963 --> 00:56:54,804
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so crazy.

645
00:56:55,125 --> 00:57:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking into an issue with their launched game and not blaming the players for having shitty computers or anything like that?

646
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:04,037
[SPEAKER_05]: This is crazy!

647
00:57:04,398 --> 00:57:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they running a business like this?

648
00:57:07,462 --> 00:57:08,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

649
00:57:08,183 --> 00:57:12,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently it's working for them because, you know, 700,000 players playing that game.

650
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

651
00:57:14,212 --> 00:57:17,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing that will keep Microsoft afloat at the end of the day, right?

652
00:57:17,877 --> 00:57:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Or excuse me, Battlefield's EA.

653
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:20,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Battlefield's EA.

654
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:22,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

655
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:27,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I have never professed to be the expert on the shooty, shooty, bang, bang games, okay?

656
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:32,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but yeah, but of course, obviously we talked at length about what EA's facing, you know, last week and yeah.

657
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:34,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

658
00:57:34,499 --> 00:57:41,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be curious to see what Black Ops 7 does, especially considering, you know, the backlash with all the Xbox stuff.

659
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:41,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

660
00:57:43,102 --> 00:57:43,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

661
00:57:43,943 --> 00:57:44,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

662
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll make a difference.

663
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

664
00:57:47,749 --> 00:57:49,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to make some a difference.

665
00:57:49,652 --> 00:58:00,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think also with Call of Duty especially, it's really gone the Fortnite route where they're just throwing everything at the wall.

666
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Just with all the tie-ins with...

667
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:10,560
[SPEAKER_05]: rappers, other pop culture things, actors.

668
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say, I think they did have like some people in, well, yeah, because Jay and Silent Bob were in there as well.

669
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:23,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Just all sorts of pop culture stuff that doesn't necessarily lend itself to Call of Duty.

670
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:29,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Just throwing that all in there just to make up more money with cosmetics.

671
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's just...

672
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:58,519
[SPEAKER_05]: so it'll be interesting to see what happens this year how that how a successful Battlefield 6 is going to impact their game and that's good because if it does impact their game then that means that hey we can't just put the slop out we need to really tool our game and innovate and so that's what it's going to take is innovation because you know the last few years of Call of Duty not really innovative and that's because they didn't have to compete against Battlefield yeah

673
00:59:00,102 --> 00:59:07,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well let's move on and talk about something that caught a lot of people's eye this week that wasn't necessarily a game, but it was certainly inspired by a game.

674
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an animated short that was put out by Nintendo.

675
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:15,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the short first came out, people were a little bit confused what it was all about.

676
00:59:15,772 --> 00:59:20,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a Pixar-esque sort of animated short that showed, you know, a child...

677
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:24,707
[SPEAKER_07]: and some people caught some references to Pikmin within the short.

678
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:29,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And sure enough, the next day it was shown that, yep, it has to do with Pikmin.

679
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,376
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little short that involves Pikmin.

680
00:59:31,817 --> 00:59:39,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo put out a statement saying, we hope you enjoyed the two close to you videos released on October 7th and 8th.

681
00:59:39,528 --> 00:59:42,552
[SPEAKER_07]: The second video is available on Nintendo Today.

682
00:59:42,652 --> 00:59:49,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of interesting that they put out that teaser and then wanted people to go to the Nintendo Today app to see the second half, which of course got...

683
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:57,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was the second half, it was just that it was a different version.

684
00:59:57,301 --> 01:00:03,356
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one that hid that it was Pikmin in there doing all the things.

685
01:00:03,396 --> 01:00:04,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just invisible.

686
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah.

687
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:14,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But the real important part here is that these were short films created by Nintendo Pictures Company Limited.

688
01:00:14,253 --> 01:00:21,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content, and that was put out by Nintendo.

689
01:00:21,662 --> 01:00:28,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And I couldn't help but have flashbacks to the 3DS era when you used to be able to download those 3DS movies like Dinosaur Office and stuff.

690
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:34,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I was like, oh, this would have been a great thing for Nintendo to have a picture studio for then.

691
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:49,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they're creating shorts to add value to the Nintendo Today app, or could they eventually, you know, now that like the Nintendo Cinematic Universe is very clearly a thing, we're getting a Mario movie sequel, a Zelda movie is happening.

692
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:51,413
[SPEAKER_07]: It will almost certainly do very well.

693
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:55,718
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not living in the age of the 90s video game translations anymore.

694
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:58,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Many video game translations into media are

695
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,183
[SPEAKER_07]: are being, you know, well received.

696
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:04,509
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's still a few stinkers in there, but most of them are pretty well received and do well.

697
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:09,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Could Nintendo end up making their own movie?

698
01:01:10,057 --> 01:01:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe in partnership with probably Universal or one of their distribution partners, but could Nintendo make their own movie, whether it be Pikmin or question mark, question mark, something else?

699
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring the Animal Crossing movie over here.

700
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Localize the Animal Crossing movie.

701
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:23,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

702
01:01:23,236 --> 01:01:24,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not an Animal Crossing movie?

703
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:25,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

704
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:26,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

705
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cute movie.

706
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:32,379
[SPEAKER_07]: MikeDev says, and no people were not getting a Smash movie.

707
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:47,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Never say never, but it certainly wouldn't have... Well, again, never say never, but there's a lot of... Like, to have every character, there would have to be a lot of agreements with other parties, namely the Pokemon Company, but... Maybe the original Smash.

708
01:01:47,323 --> 01:01:47,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

709
01:01:47,924 --> 01:01:48,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Pokemon Company.

710
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:49,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's...

711
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:52,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like everything is figureoutable when it comes to making money.

712
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just feel like cinematically, there's a long way to go.

713
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:01,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't play out the way y'all think it plays out.

714
01:02:01,948 --> 01:02:04,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo is not fucking Marvel.

715
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:09,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Smash movie does not happen like the fucking original Iron Man movie and the ending and all that shit.

716
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,283
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not happening.

717
01:02:10,303 --> 01:02:11,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it out of your head.

718
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:19,779
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe an animated series or yeah, maybe a Smash movie and some other type of universe could happen.

719
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think we're like at least a decade away from having the Nintendo Cinematic Universe established enough to even get to that sort of spot.

720
01:02:30,432 --> 01:02:31,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is.

721
01:02:31,774 --> 01:02:59,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

722
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:00,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

723
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:05,543
[SPEAKER_07]: They've already, some of the casting stuff is, you know, whatever you want to believe.

724
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:07,066
[SPEAKER_07]: But we know they're filming in New Zealand.

725
01:03:07,126 --> 01:03:08,267
[SPEAKER_07]: That we know, right?

726
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:10,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know.

727
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:15,718
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, you thank Sonic for making video game movies good.

728
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that the first one?

729
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it was a big box office success.

730
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:23,890
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's like Detective Pikachu and all that stuff before.

731
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:29,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I sort of feel like it was The Witcher, which I know was based off a book.

732
01:03:29,815 --> 01:03:41,086
[SPEAKER_07]: but the Netflix series was the game and I really feel like the one-two punch of The Witcher and the Castlevania anime is what opened the floodgates to what we have now.

733
01:03:41,246 --> 01:03:43,508
[SPEAKER_05]: But sure, the Sonic movie helped.

734
01:03:44,289 --> 01:03:49,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic is a well-established franchise.

735
01:03:49,854 --> 01:03:53,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonic is an Iron Man in its own thing.

736
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:55,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a well-established movie franchise now.

737
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing with Minecraft at this point, which we'll get to later.

738
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:04,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, but for now, let's talk about other popular gaming IPs.

739
01:04:04,218 --> 01:04:04,902
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

740
01:04:06,535 --> 01:04:20,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I have brought up, by the way, a site before that was trying to get mobile games and old Keitai games to be able to be ripped and put available for other people.

741
01:04:20,892 --> 01:04:25,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one in particular, there's a game that they thought they would never get.

742
01:04:26,438 --> 01:04:33,186
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Ratchet & Clank mobile game that was actually a cancelled game.

743
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:36,390
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Ratchet & Clank Clone Home.

744
01:04:36,370 --> 01:05:04,690
[SPEAKER_01]: and they actually have found a phone, a Sony Ericsson that had this game on it definitely needed some polish but it was on the Sony Ericsson W880i and encrypted they said it was going to be hopeless to get it off of there but then they managed to crack the phone's encryption extract the game and archive it

745
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:09,988
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is complete and fully playable.

746
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:24,061
[SPEAKER_01]: The thought had been that it was developed by handheld games, but it was more likely a company called JavaGround that did Sony's... The last few J2ME games, the Java games.

747
01:05:24,943 --> 01:05:32,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it might have even been accidentally uploaded to Singular or Sprint for a little while, and then people were able to download it.

748
01:05:32,294 --> 01:05:33,376
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say it's really good.

749
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:34,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

750
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:43,727
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play as two different Lumbaxes and you get a gun called the UZ, E-W-E-Z-I-E, that turns your enemies into sheep.

751
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:55,800
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason that anyone could think of was why it may have been cancelled in the first place was some litigation between Sony and Handheld.

752
01:05:57,802 --> 01:05:59,423
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one is out.

753
01:05:59,443 --> 01:06:00,985
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download it off the Archive.

754
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:14,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Love to see games lost to time make their way back, even when they're kind of, you know, old, old phone games that I remember my crappy little Sprint phone and some of the games that were on that.

755
01:06:14,468 --> 01:06:16,231
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's probably where this game was meant to be played.

756
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:21,661
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was set to be released in 2006 for Java phones.

757
01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:23,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Attracts.

758
01:06:23,364 --> 01:06:25,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, there you go.

759
01:06:25,287 --> 01:06:26,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

760
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

761
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:27,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

762
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:36,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, unfortunately some bad news as far as studios shutting down or having layoffs.

763
01:06:36,812 --> 01:06:52,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So first, we have an indie studio, of course, Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash has announced that they're winding down their development of Hyper Light Breaker, and this is coming right after they had layoffs announced.

764
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:59,687
[SPEAKER_05]: As we wrap up our work at Hyper Light Breaker, we've had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members.

765
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:04,733
[SPEAKER_05]: This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.

766
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that the news reflects broader forces beyond our control, including a shift in funding, corporate consolidation, and uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.

767
01:07:20,463 --> 01:07:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, fortunately, to go along with that, we have, of course, The Outsiders, which is the developer of Metal Hellsinger, and they are shutting down.

768
01:07:31,195 --> 01:07:37,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So it says, you know, change is always tough, and right now we're all hurting.

769
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:46,071
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, they have announced their studio closure, which was only 10 years old.

770
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:47,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's unfortunate.

771
01:07:48,695 --> 01:07:51,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Another week, another two studios shutting down.

772
01:07:51,341 --> 01:07:55,329
[SPEAKER_07]: When does the madness end?

773
01:07:55,349 --> 01:08:01,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think... Well, at least the one... Heart Machine's not shutting down when they're laying off people, though.

774
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry.

775
01:08:02,444 --> 01:08:04,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Two studios doing layoffs, I guess.

776
01:08:04,629 --> 01:08:07,615
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, it's just wild.

777
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:12,433
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk a little bit about Fortnite.

778
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Fortnite, you can create things for Fortnite.

779
01:08:17,422 --> 01:08:27,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you do create things, you can get a little bit of money for that, depending on how many people are interacting with the things that you created.

780
01:08:27,642 --> 01:08:33,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Two Michigan-based Fortnite creators are being sued by Epic Games.

781
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:41,500
[SPEAKER_07]: In the allegations, it's said that the two defendants created 20,000 bots to inflate the popularity of their maps.

782
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:47,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know, again, if you're trying to get to the top of the rankings to get discovered, it sounds like Twitch viewbotting.

783
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:49,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Twitch viewbotting, but in Fortnite.

784
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like that, basically, okay?

785
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Or YouTube botting, or any of those types of sites, right?

786
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:55,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

787
01:08:55,672 --> 01:09:05,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Once they get that, then they get a little more of that organic growth, but you used fake growth to get there, which is a big no-no.

788
01:09:05,424 --> 01:09:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it pushes you to the top of the search or the front page.

789
01:09:09,849 --> 01:09:13,333
[SPEAKER_07]: You see this happen on mobile store things a lot, too.

790
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:16,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the same thing happens in Roblox and stuff as well.

791
01:09:16,817 --> 01:09:24,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they pay to have these bots push you to the front page, and most of the kids and stuff that are playing these maps or playing these games in Fortnite...

792
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:29,632
[SPEAKER_05]: or Roblox, they're not scrolling through multiple pages to find something.

793
01:09:29,672 --> 01:09:30,533
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, yeah, that looks good.

794
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:32,055
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take that and play that.

795
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:34,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's kind of what's happening here.

796
01:09:34,657 --> 01:09:51,295
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like where it went on, which is very interesting because Epic in their allegations say that the defendants were trying to go around the terms of service, having the bots flood the islands, and they were doing it, quote, using a cloud gaming service that allowed users to play video games like Fortnite remotely.

797
01:09:51,275 --> 01:10:21,282
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the defendants supposedly earned tens of thousands of dollars through this but Epic finally caught them and said you have to stop playing the game and destroy all copies of Fortnite that sounds like a cease and desist to me basically that they were told you have broken the rules and you are banned from Fortnite forever and you don't make any money because that violated the terms of agreement that you signed however they didn't stop and that's where the lawsuit comes in so Epic said

798
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:36,418
[SPEAKER_07]: ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

799
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:39,371
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're Bloodline from playing Fortnite.

800
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:40,592
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do that.

801
01:10:40,893 --> 01:10:42,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It is weird, isn't it?

802
01:10:42,415 --> 01:10:43,998
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what it is.

803
01:10:44,018 --> 01:10:48,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Your children's children's children do not get to fort the night.

804
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:55,416
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the name of ancient royal punishment is this?

805
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,339
[SPEAKER_01]: The three generation rule?

806
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:58,981
[SPEAKER_01]: The seven generation rule?

807
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:02,046
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very interesting.

808
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:03,368
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

809
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:10,579
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, well, that part is a little nonsense, but obviously... Dishonor on your cow!

810
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:23,030
[SPEAKER_07]: If these guys were viewbotting, which it sounds like, or, you know, I'm sorry, but the equivalent of that, which it sounds like Epic has the evidence and the receipts to show that, then, yeah, the punishment is you're banned.

811
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:25,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and you don't get to make money.

812
01:11:26,433 --> 01:11:33,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the generational ban's a little silly, but, you know, maybe this is one of those cases where they're asking for more, knowing they'll get less.

813
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:59,697
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

814
01:12:01,955 --> 01:12:08,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably would have been like all morning and all kinds of stuff, but no.

815
01:12:09,126 --> 01:12:14,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Demento has played his official last show ever.

816
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:19,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

817
01:12:20,683 --> 01:12:22,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad, he is not pulling an OLR.

818
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,469
[SPEAKER_01]: He is Dr. Demento.

819
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,533
[SPEAKER_01]: He pulls Dr. Demento.

820
01:12:29,235 --> 01:12:44,139
[SPEAKER_01]: His final traditional episode came out on May 31st, and then he announced his retirement and said he was going to host retrospective episodes that would count down his favorite records decade by decade.

821
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,482
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the man's 84.

822
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:47,464
[SPEAKER_01]: He's earned it.

823
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:52,752
[SPEAKER_01]: But he did his final...

824
01:12:52,732 --> 01:13:04,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode three and a half hours long extravaganza, counting down his top 40 most demanded, demented discs and tapes from across his career.

825
01:13:06,054 --> 01:13:10,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, he started in 1970 in Pasadena.

826
01:13:10,862 --> 01:13:13,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not for him, would we have had Weird Al?

827
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:13,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird Al?

828
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:14,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not.

829
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:16,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Who else had he given?

830
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:25,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Judy Tanuta and just a bunch of... Who wrote that song that went star trekking across the universe?

831
01:13:25,286 --> 01:13:26,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the universe.

832
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:29,212
[SPEAKER_07]: That song.

833
01:13:29,693 --> 01:13:31,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever did that.

834
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:31,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Captain Kirk.

835
01:13:31,816 --> 01:13:31,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

836
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:38,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really... Okay.

837
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:40,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

838
01:13:41,109 --> 01:13:41,349
[SPEAKER_01]: R.I.P.

839
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Judy Tanuta.

840
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:43,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

841
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Tetsuya, Dr. Demento.

842
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:49,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see Weird at all?

843
01:13:49,114 --> 01:13:50,737
[SPEAKER_01]: The Weird Al movie with Daniel Radcliffe.

844
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:56,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he wore a top hat and everything and did his show.

845
01:13:57,587 --> 01:14:00,051
[SPEAKER_07]: He looked like a guy that would call himself Dr. Demento.

846
01:14:01,394 --> 01:14:04,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the man's amazing.

847
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:08,605
[SPEAKER_01]: But he...

848
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:18,619
[SPEAKER_01]: He played It's a Gas on his show, which is just burps.

849
01:14:18,799 --> 01:14:24,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you've definitely earned your retirement, Dr. Demento.

850
01:14:24,989 --> 01:14:25,770
[SPEAKER_01]: We salute you.

851
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:37,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for giving us, gosh, since the 70s, 55 years.

852
01:14:38,352 --> 01:14:39,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Dr. Domeno.

853
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:42,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolute joy and bizarreness.

854
01:14:43,469 --> 01:14:44,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Domeno, we salute you.

855
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:45,997
[SPEAKER_07]: We salute you so hard.

856
01:14:46,017 --> 01:14:47,121
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do the same thing.

857
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:47,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

858
01:14:48,747 --> 01:14:51,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm attacking the darkness.

859
01:14:52,612 --> 01:14:53,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Dead L. Wives.

860
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:54,454
[SPEAKER_01]: We got that.

861
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,395
[SPEAKER_01]: We got boot to the head.

862
01:14:56,096 --> 01:15:06,669
[SPEAKER_07]: To the credit of PodCulture's joke earlier saying I gotta get better joke writers, I mean, like, I thank Dr. Domeno because now it's a very convenient excuse when somebody says, well, why now?

863
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:10,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be like, well, Dr. Domeno did it.

864
01:15:10,994 --> 01:15:11,375
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

865
01:15:11,575 --> 01:15:16,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's get to the classic game of the week.

866
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:19,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, we got to run the bump to make that happen.

867
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:36,827
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

868
01:15:37,308 --> 01:15:41,254
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

869
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get a weird one tonight.

870
01:15:42,956 --> 01:15:44,719
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

871
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:50,007
[SPEAKER_01]: The game is IS, Internal Section.

872
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:56,747
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a PlayStation game that was developed by Positron and published by Square, released in 1999.

873
01:15:57,208 --> 01:16:12,805
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a tube shooter, like Tempest 2000 and Nitrous Oxide, where you sort of look down a tube and then you move around and shoot enemies that are coming toward you through the tube.

874
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:22,762
[SPEAKER_01]: and this one was an experimental project and it responds to these built-in tracks kind of like what Vibraban did.

875
01:16:23,343 --> 01:16:30,693
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even put in your own music CD and so the levels will change based on the music.

876
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:32,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

877
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Rimari says I'm also getting disoriented.

878
01:16:37,763 --> 01:16:38,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is disorienting.

879
01:16:39,245 --> 01:16:41,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great game though.

880
01:16:42,434 --> 01:16:50,853
[SPEAKER_01]: and it has 12 different weapons, all of which are named from the Chinese Zodiac and it's flat shaded models.

881
01:16:51,034 --> 01:16:58,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Your ship and your enemies are just simple polygons and it has, you know, that late 90s, you know, electronica.

882
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:01,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, you can play any music that you want to.

883
01:17:01,915 --> 01:17:07,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released on January 28th, 1999 for the PlayStation, published by Square.

884
01:17:07,563 --> 01:17:09,706
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never released outside of Japan.

885
01:17:10,146 --> 01:17:14,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been re-released for PSN's Game Archives in Japan.

886
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:22,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And a track from the game was released in the compilation CD Square Enix Battle Tracks Volume 3, Square 1999-2000.

887
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:29,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu gave it a 24 out of 40, which, you know, not bad for Famitsu.

888
01:17:32,103 --> 01:17:35,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Video Games, I guess another magazine, gave it a 4 out of 5 score.

889
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:41,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Gamers Republic said that it was one of the best games to import from Japan that year.

890
01:17:41,696 --> 01:17:50,088
[SPEAKER_01]: It also included Bangaio, an Evangelion game, Pepsi Man, Robot Dandy, and The Adventures of Little Ralph on the list.

891
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Some decent games, although Pepsi Man is questionable.

892
01:17:53,292 --> 01:18:20,413
[SPEAKER_01]: um in 2015 Retro Gamer Magazine uh listed it as number five on those the 20 greatest PlayStation games you've never played although I've played it and it was fun so there you go yeah it's pretty trippy looking I mean it's it's a fun game for me I it kind of sets my brain off after a while and I have to stop but um but it's it's a fun one and the fact that you can put in different discs and make it a different game every time

893
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:23,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I get Super Hexagon vibes a little bit from this.

894
01:18:23,446 --> 01:18:27,474
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost a little too flashy, but if you turn the brightness down, it might be doable.

895
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:32,825
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's definitely... This is very much a PlayStation-era game to me.

896
01:18:33,627 --> 01:18:34,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

897
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:42,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a game that you're really not going to be able to do a repeat of...

898
01:18:42,044 --> 01:18:42,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

899
01:18:45,488 --> 01:19:11,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

900
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:12,394
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

901
01:19:13,635 --> 01:19:15,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Dark City brings up Audio Surf.

902
01:19:15,457 --> 01:19:17,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's probably the closest we had.

903
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:23,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was a sequel to Audio Surf that I swear you just never heard about.

904
01:19:23,065 --> 01:19:25,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it happened, but anyway.

905
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:25,728
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

906
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:26,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, great pick.

907
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:30,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the classic game of the week.

908
01:19:30,413 --> 01:19:39,323
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to get back into some more news, but we're going to do some quick headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

909
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:40,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

910
01:19:40,482 --> 01:19:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all about Minecraft stuff!

911
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:43,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Shocking.

912
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:49,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So, a bit of a fun thing, and then, of course, we're going to talk about the second movie.

913
01:19:50,383 --> 01:19:58,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing, obviously, remember that Sonic Racing Crossworlds just came out, and it just came out on PC, so what's that mean?

914
01:19:58,741 --> 01:20:28,596
[SPEAKER_05]: mods of course and so to be silly somebody has taken the Jack Black iteration of Minecraft Steve and put it in the game as well as the Minecraft skin version of Steve in there as well and the chicken jockey and it has of course all the one-liners from the movie yeah and it's exactly what you expect but I thought that was pretty funny

915
01:20:28,643 --> 01:20:57,435
[SPEAKER_05]: then of course Mojang has announced or I should say Microsoft's announced even that Minecraft is getting a second movie it'll be coming out July 23rd 2027 there's something to help Microsoft make money amongst all these other bad news yeah so cool look forward to seeing that in a few years look forward to seeing how the kids Rocky Horror this one

916
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,487
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, on a completely personal selfish note, go ahead.

917
01:21:03,048 --> 01:21:13,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to mention about Rocky Horror, actually, because when we were at the movie theater yesterday, they were selling, you know, all the expensive popcorn buckets that you can get for, like, a bunch of things.

918
01:21:13,905 --> 01:21:17,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're really pushing those popcorn buckets hard, like, for Tron.

919
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:21,577
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some, like, Dude Perfect movie and stuff.

920
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:22,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like...

921
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:23,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

922
01:21:23,272 --> 01:21:26,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Who wants a Dude Perfect popcorn bucket?

923
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:33,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But they had one for Rocky Horror Picture Show, so I'm wondering if they're doing some big Fathom event thing in theaters or something like that.

924
01:21:33,294 --> 01:21:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: They already did 4D screenings because a lot of our cast went.

925
01:21:37,122 --> 01:21:39,066
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed it, but...

926
01:21:39,046 --> 01:21:43,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the 50th anniversary of Rocky Horror, and that's actually what I was going to talk about.

927
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:47,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to say, if you've never seen it before, it's playing everywhere now for the 50th.

928
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:52,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would say don't see it in a normal movie theater because you're not going to get the full experience.

929
01:21:52,244 --> 01:21:55,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to go do one where the cast is doing it in front of the screen.

930
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:57,492
[SPEAKER_07]: The regulars are there yelling the lines.

931
01:21:58,473 --> 01:21:58,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

932
01:21:58,553 --> 01:22:04,020
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one in Sacramento coming up, self-plug here, right at the end of the month on the 25th.

933
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:09,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that show is probably about four-fifths on its way to being sold out.

934
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So get on it.

935
01:22:11,689 --> 01:22:15,593
[SPEAKER_07]: But in your neck of the woods, they may have some screenings that are still available.

936
01:22:15,714 --> 01:22:23,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Barry, Pat, and Nell, three of the stars of the film, are all touring around the country everywhere.

937
01:22:23,663 --> 01:22:44,035
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

938
01:22:45,415 --> 01:22:53,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Switch Online has just received some other games, some snussy stuff.

939
01:22:53,464 --> 01:23:04,115
[SPEAKER_01]: We now have Mario & Wario, Bubsy & Claw's Encounters of the Third Kind, and Fatal Fury Special, all for Switch 2 and for Switch.

940
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:12,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario & Wario was only released in Japan on Super Famicom, and it has other options for mouse controls on Switch 2.

941
01:23:13,276 --> 01:23:14,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll have to check that out.

942
01:23:14,277 --> 01:23:17,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never played that, and I've been curious about it, so cool.

943
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:26,993
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's talk about Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII remasters.

944
01:23:27,133 --> 01:23:31,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they are being re-released in a twin pack for the Nintendo Switch.

945
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,225
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming out on December 9th, along with a Final Fantasy IX physical edition.

946
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:52,280
[SPEAKER_07]: These versions were actually already released in Asia in a physical edition, but these are now coming out for the US just in time for the holidays for folks that maybe want to pick this up for whatever reason in a physical way.

947
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I should point out this is not the Final Fantasy VII Remake.

948
01:23:55,548 --> 01:24:04,076
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the Final Fantasy VII Remaster that's kind of cycled its way through PC and PlayStation 4 and it's been, you know, here and there and everywhere.

949
01:24:04,096 --> 01:24:08,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want that and Final Fantasy VIII in a combo pack, that is available.

950
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,743
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest, I did not like the Final Fantasy VIII Remaster.

951
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:15,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I've had my share of Duncan on Final Fantasy VIII over the years and my issues with it.

952
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:18,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, that has nothing to do with the Remaster.

953
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:24,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I really, really hated how you had some things that were changed and some things that weren't on top of each other.

954
01:24:24,694 --> 01:24:25,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a terrible look.

955
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

956
01:24:51,843 --> 01:24:57,064

[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually next week.

971
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:29,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

972
01:26:29,768 --> 01:26:31,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Just notice that's the 21st.

973
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:32,030
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it then.

974
01:26:32,531 --> 01:26:32,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

975
01:26:33,251 --> 01:26:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the releases there.

976
01:26:35,794 --> 01:26:43,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, for the Switch 2, Pokemon Legends ZA is a huge release and is released in Japan this week.

977
01:26:43,141 --> 01:26:45,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that's got to be a worldwide date for that.

978
01:26:46,124 --> 01:26:50,768
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a variety of accessories, most of them third-party, that are also coming out to match that.

979
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,793
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also worth pointing out because, you know, there were some –

980
01:26:55,773 --> 01:27:01,045
[SPEAKER_07]: chat in the chat for the show earlier, kind of about like, is Pokemon Legends a mainline game?

981
01:27:01,105 --> 01:27:01,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it a new gen?

982
01:27:02,027 --> 01:27:02,748
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?

983
01:27:02,909 --> 01:27:04,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a main game.

984
01:27:04,673 --> 01:27:05,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Def put it best.

985
01:27:05,675 --> 01:27:08,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a main game, but it's not like a new generation.

986
01:27:08,521 --> 01:27:13,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of revisits an old generation and puts a new spin on it with pretty much any Pokemon that's out there.

987
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: But the

988
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:19,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Other interesting thing about it, it does not do the whole X, Y, Red, Blue, Sun, Moon.

989
01:27:19,841 --> 01:27:20,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't do that.

990
01:27:20,442 --> 01:27:28,914
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one game, which I think is a good thing because all the damn Pokemon you want are in the game, or at least that you'll be able to get that gen.

991
01:27:28,934 --> 01:27:30,897
[SPEAKER_07]: But they'll be happy to sell you a DLC later, I'm sure.

992
01:27:31,017 --> 01:27:35,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so Legends is your big Switch 2 release this week, obviously.

993
01:27:35,223 --> 01:27:39,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Going over to the PlayStation 5, we have a game called Star Bites.

994
01:27:39,369 --> 01:27:42,553
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out in Japan this week on the 16th.

995
01:27:42,533 --> 01:27:45,661
[SPEAKER_07]: and that may be the only counter programming.

996
01:27:45,702 --> 01:27:50,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we don't really get any other big releases until we get to next week in Japan.

997
01:27:51,216 --> 01:27:54,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But not too surprising because Pokemon is going to be everywhere.

998
01:27:55,087 --> 01:27:57,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So DarkSakura, what do you have for the UK?

999
01:27:57,856 --> 01:27:59,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just this and that.

1000
01:27:59,759 --> 01:28:19,328
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 14th for Switch, we have Just Dance 2026 Edition, P1 Angerlight for PS5, Rising Heat for PC, Chicken Hair and the Treasure of Spiking Beard for PC, PS5, Xbox, Switch, NASCAR 25 for the consoles.

1001
01:28:20,289 --> 01:28:25,156
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 15th, we have Ball X Pit, or Ball and Pit?

1002
01:28:25,176 --> 01:28:26,398
[SPEAKER_01]: For Switch and Switch 2 and PC.

1003
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:27,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

1004
01:28:28,332 --> 01:28:30,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, basically it's ball pit.

1005
01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:31,022
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just fancy.

1006
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1007
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm being silly.

1008
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:38,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want a real ball pit now.

1009
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:40,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we have that please?

1010
01:28:40,634 --> 01:29:07,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Pokemon Legends Z-A for Switch, Switch 2 Fellowship for PC The Cabin Factory for Switch, PlayStation, Xbox Time Trekker for Switch Hitman, Absolution, iOS and Android Pokemon Legends Z-A, Mega Dimension, DLC, Holo X and Holo Y apparel items I just read the whole thing aloud now realizing they were talking about clothing No, that says Switch and Switch 2, never mind That's clothing in-game Yes, you can...

1011
01:29:07,853 --> 01:29:08,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy that.

1012
01:29:09,335 --> 01:29:13,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the 16th, we have Reach for MetaQuest, PSVR 2, SteamVR.

1013
01:29:14,102 --> 01:29:32,607
[SPEAKER_01]: We have on the 17th, Keeper for Xboxes and PC, Away From Home for PC, Lumo 2 Switch, PS5, Xboxes, Kaku, Ancient Seal for PS5, Xboxes, and the Elf on the Shelf, Christmas Heroes, PS5, PS4, Xboxes, Switch, and PC also on the 17th.

1014
01:29:35,331 --> 01:29:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1015
01:29:35,692 --> 01:29:36,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1016
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:40,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need an Elf on the Shelf game?

1017
01:29:40,427 --> 01:29:41,409
[SPEAKER_05]: They've had several.

1018
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:44,694
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not the first.

1019
01:29:44,714 --> 01:29:48,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's buying them, sadly.

1020
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the Minch on the Bench game.

1021
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:56,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Outside of Christmas nights, why buy any Christmas game for any system?

1022
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:57,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas Lemmings.

1023
01:29:57,814 --> 01:29:59,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Christmas Lemmings.

1024
01:29:59,216 --> 01:30:02,562
[SPEAKER_05]: But Christmas Lemmings wasn't that horrible.

1025
01:30:02,602 --> 01:30:04,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 30 years old.

1026
01:30:04,537 --> 01:30:09,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hold on, it's 30 years old, but that was also more of like, here's a shareware disc type of game.

1027
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:16,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a demo, essentially, with a skin on it.

1028
01:30:16,372 --> 01:30:20,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have like four different copies of Christmas Nights, including a Japanese one.

1029
01:30:21,138 --> 01:30:22,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I disagree.

1030
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:32,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see more special Christmas things, and all holidays, all representation for what people get into in December, but I would love to see, like, I love it in MMOs.

1031
01:30:32,853 --> 01:31:01,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it when like the big holiday trees are up and like the Final Fantasy plazas and the game I play and things like that I would love to see like Pokemon Legends ZA like look at the main town get like a holiday makeover and stuff like I think that would be so cool I say bring more Christmas games or at least more Christmas theming and all holidays I think y'all know optional theming is fine but like a dedicated Christmas game like when's that if it's not Gremlins I'm not interested

1032
01:31:01,574 --> 01:31:07,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Is your child really going to be playing the Elf on the Shelf game in June of this year?

1033
01:31:07,082 --> 01:31:08,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh man, I gotta get back.

1034
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:11,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta get my homework done so I can play the Elf on the Shelf game.

1035
01:31:11,609 --> 01:31:13,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's people that watch Christmas movies all year round.

1036
01:31:13,732 --> 01:31:15,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Elf is a good example.

1037
01:31:15,074 --> 01:31:17,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are freaks, but you know what?

1038
01:31:17,358 --> 01:31:21,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Elf is the only acceptable Christmas movie to watch all the time.

1039
01:31:22,045 --> 01:31:25,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when am I going to get my Hebrew Hammer adventure game?

1040
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:26,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And Batman Returns.

1041
01:31:29,148 --> 01:31:32,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the Hebrew Hammer as an adventure game.

1042
01:31:32,532 --> 01:31:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, not Die Hard, folks.

1043
01:31:34,494 --> 01:31:34,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Die Hard.

1044
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:36,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only watch Die Hard at Christmas.

1045
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:41,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1046
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Gremlins is still the best.

1047
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, poor Bruce Willis with Bruce Willis' health.

1048
01:31:44,926 --> 01:31:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's going to be a big resurgence in people watching Die Hard.

1049
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:53,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I should shut my mouth and move on for a change and move on to the next story.

1050
01:31:54,797 --> 01:31:57,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki with one more story for us before we get to the Listener Roundtable.

1051
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:03,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's always fun to do those post-mortems and be like, what went wrong?

1052
01:32:03,908 --> 01:32:18,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, for those who don't remember Mind's Eye, Build a Rocket Boy, you know, over 250 developers were laid off from the studio recently following the disastrous launch of the game.

1053
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:27,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And of that, of course, the devs have been blasting the former...

1054
01:32:27,502 --> 01:32:30,229
[SPEAKER_05]: CEO or their former CEO.

1055
01:32:30,309 --> 01:32:38,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies said that there is poor working conditions and chaotic layoffs.

1056
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:44,683
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the arrogance of leadership to believe that they can actually act with impunity throughout the

1057
01:32:44,663 --> 01:32:53,338
[SPEAKER_05]: and following redundancies has pushed myself and many former continuing employees to take a stand.

1058
01:32:54,419 --> 01:33:05,558
[SPEAKER_05]: They wrote a statement to their leadership talking about basically saying we stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build A Rocket.

1059
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:16,569
[SPEAKER_05]: as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter condemning the way at which they've been mistreated and discarded by the studio's millionaire executives.

1060
01:33:16,589 --> 01:33:20,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, yeah, I mean, of course it's going to be the higher-ups that are screwing that game over.

1061
01:33:20,653 --> 01:33:22,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

1062
01:33:24,297 --> 01:33:29,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we're going to hear a lot more about this, especially if there is a lawsuit that ends up going forward.

1063
01:33:29,322 --> 01:33:32,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, yeah.

1064
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:42,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, boy, this game sure didn't end up being worth it for all the drama surrounding it.

1065
01:33:44,302 --> 01:33:48,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to make light of this shitty situation for all the developers that were working their ass off on it.

1066
01:33:48,993 --> 01:33:51,880
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really unfortunate how that all turned out.

1067
01:33:52,518 --> 01:33:53,219
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1068
01:33:53,239 --> 01:33:55,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to go to the listener roundtable next.

1069
01:33:55,604 --> 01:34:00,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys can always send us social media posts over at Blue Sky.

1070
01:34:00,513 --> 01:34:01,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also send us emails.

1071
01:34:01,755 --> 01:34:05,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.

1072
01:34:05,783 --> 01:34:11,293
[SPEAKER_07]: With the announcement last week, I think some folks have been sending in some emails to pay respects.

1073
01:34:11,433 --> 01:34:14,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Push F and some other keys.

1074
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:16,062
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's get to it, DarkSakura.

1075
01:34:16,835 --> 01:34:17,637
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one email.

1076
01:34:19,741 --> 01:34:23,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, this is Jessie, aka Illegally Cited.

1077
01:34:23,068 --> 01:34:25,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't written in very often, but I've been listening for years and years.

1078
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:30,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember listening to this show in early 2000s and liking the chemistry of the group.

1079
01:34:30,322 --> 01:34:33,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really into dance games, though, so I took a short break from the podcast.

1080
01:34:33,529 --> 01:34:35,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, though, I've been listening ever since.

1081
01:34:35,272 --> 01:34:35,954
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I feel old.

1082
01:34:36,956 --> 01:34:37,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

1083
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:42,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit, it was very surprising to hear this show will be ending after so many years.

1084
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:45,565
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it would eventually, but it's still surprising when it does.

1085
01:34:45,585 --> 01:34:52,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I can definitely relate to why you want to quit with all the hate and negativity, not to mention greed of the industry.

1086
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:59,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been running a YouTube channel that focuses on technology game and XR accessibility since 2012.

1087
01:34:59,309 --> 01:34:59,550
[SPEAKER_01]: .

1088
01:34:59,570 --> 01:34:59,850
[SPEAKER_01]: .

1089
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:15,445
[SPEAKER_01]: .

1090
01:35:15,425 --> 01:35:23,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the indies and smaller games are where the industry is the strongest and that's where I've been putting most of my focus in games the past several years.

1091
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are only paying attention to the big budget sequels and remakes things definitely seem a little stale.

1092
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:34,142
[SPEAKER_01]: I can count how many amazing smaller games are coming out these days and so many I can't keep up with them all.

1093
01:35:34,122 --> 01:35:39,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for such a long email, but I figured I had to write in one more time before this version of the show ends.

1094
01:35:39,749 --> 01:35:43,413
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever want a guest or is curious about game accessibility, please reach out.

1095
01:35:43,433 --> 01:35:44,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to chat.

1096
01:35:44,895 --> 01:35:47,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the most positive areas in gaming right now.

1097
01:35:47,518 --> 01:35:49,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on so many years of the show.

1098
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:57,249
[SPEAKER_01]: It will definitely be weird not having a new episode every week, even though I'm one of the archived listeners.

1099
01:35:57,269 --> 01:35:58,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse.

1100
01:36:00,333 --> 01:36:01,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Who said anything about quitting?

1101
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:03,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

1102
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:04,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing something else.

1103
01:36:05,412 --> 01:36:08,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep going, just not with OLR.

1104
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:20,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is great for those that are looking for something to continue to listen to and support, because of course you and all your co-conspirators and whatever your new adventure is will need the support, right?

1105
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that'd be great.

1106
01:36:22,733 --> 01:36:24,075
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bobby Blackwolf?

1107
01:36:24,055 --> 01:36:48,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

1108
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:52,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever we can do to support you getting your voice out there.

1109
01:36:52,285 --> 01:36:55,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think it's very nice you want to come on the show and talk about it.

1110
01:36:55,189 --> 01:36:57,632
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a little difficult with only so many episodes remaining.

1111
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,776
[SPEAKER_07]: But what can we do to help empower you to get your voice out there?

1112
01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:05,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you have a YouTube that you're running.

1113
01:37:06,202 --> 01:37:07,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure we have the name.

1114
01:37:07,343 --> 01:37:10,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's just under illegally cited as well or something else.

1115
01:37:10,707 --> 01:37:13,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But what...

1116
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:18,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually looking at a Blue Sky post I was going to read here that says, it's from Blue Swim.

1117
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize that name from some time ago.

1118
01:37:21,684 --> 01:37:26,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, the podcast that made me want to become a podcaster is ending next month after 23 years.

1119
01:37:26,531 --> 01:37:29,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to Jamie, Rob, and Matt on a hell of a run.

1120
01:37:29,997 --> 01:37:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for that.

1121
01:37:30,818 --> 01:37:31,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

1122
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really is like the biggest compliment.

1123
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:39,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I think any of us, you know, I don't want to speak for Jamie and Matt, but I know for me, when I hear somebody else saying,

1124
01:37:39,132 --> 01:37:42,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I started a podcast because I heard you guys and I wanted to do one.

1125
01:37:42,262 --> 01:37:45,191
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no better compliment in my opinion.

1126
01:37:47,218 --> 01:37:49,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the time that we're inspiring people.

1127
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:51,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1128
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love it.

1129
01:37:53,297 --> 01:37:57,285
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really makes me feel good about what we did.

1130
01:37:57,806 --> 01:38:01,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes, you know, let's be honest.

1131
01:38:01,914 --> 01:38:03,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at Twitch right now.

1132
01:38:03,738 --> 01:38:08,086
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 31 people watching, which is a little higher than it usually is, to be quite honest.

1133
01:38:08,147 --> 01:38:10,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not about quantity.

1134
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:12,936
[SPEAKER_07]: But sometimes it is a little...

1135
01:38:13,068 --> 01:38:30,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

1136
01:38:30,432 --> 01:38:59,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1137
01:39:00,419 --> 01:39:03,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rinmari says, I never really noticed the viewer count.

1138
01:39:03,112 --> 01:39:06,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And trust me, Mari, if I made decisions based off a viewer count...

1139
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:08,516
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's okay.

1140
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:10,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Viewer counts aren't really accurate anyway.

1141
01:39:10,398 --> 01:39:13,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't have to be that.

1142
01:39:13,982 --> 01:39:17,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at it as a small congregation, a strip mall church.

1143
01:39:17,746 --> 01:39:22,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to sound sacrilegious, but a strip mall church usually has 20 people to go on Sunday nights.

1144
01:39:22,972 --> 01:39:27,276
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's enough of a fam to give them community to keep them going.

1145
01:39:27,296 --> 01:39:30,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I feel about it.

1146
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:37,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still enough of a strong community to keep things going and to keep it as long as it has.

1147
01:39:36,987 --> 01:39:45,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw a TikTok from a drag performer friend of mine this week, and I was like, this is extremely on the nose.

1148
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:47,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is speaking for myself.

1149
01:39:47,904 --> 01:39:53,753
[SPEAKER_07]: This drag performer in the TikTok said that they were speaking with a friend or a therapist or something like that.

1150
01:39:53,773 --> 01:39:59,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And that individual said, when was the last time you took a day off from work?

1151
01:40:00,157 --> 01:40:13,874
[SPEAKER_07]: and the performer said, oh, I don't know, maybe a few months ago when I went on vacation or I took a day off on Friday and that person said, no, when was the last time you took a day off from work?

1152
01:40:13,894 --> 01:40:22,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you do your day job, you go do something on Saturday, you go do something on Sunday, you are always working every day.

1153
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:24,006
[SPEAKER_07]: When was the last time you took a day off?

1154
01:40:24,026 --> 01:40:28,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And I literally saw this TikTok and this individual post this last week and I was like,

1155
01:40:29,249 --> 01:40:39,434
[SPEAKER_07]: This, I feel this, you know, and again, that's for me personally, is that I think now is just a good time for me to have a day off.

1156
01:40:41,338 --> 01:40:43,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

1157
01:40:45,147 --> 01:40:47,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to read some other posts.

1158
01:40:48,824 --> 01:40:54,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there's some kind words about the show.

1159
01:40:54,491 --> 01:41:03,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw one here from James B. Jones over on Blue Sky that said Orange Launch Radio, quite literally a generational podcast that I listened to for years.

1160
01:41:04,084 --> 01:41:07,068
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the first time I've heard this show described as generational.

1161
01:41:07,569 --> 01:41:12,135
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess 23 years does encompass more than one generation, doesn't it?

1162
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:14,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, dang, when I heard that.

1163
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:16,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, is that who that is, Bobby?

1164
01:41:16,842 --> 01:41:20,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't place the name and I didn't recognize the photo.

1165
01:41:20,268 --> 01:41:23,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says that's Maximus Panicus from the All Games days.

1166
01:41:23,334 --> 01:41:24,136
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.

1167
01:41:24,216 --> 01:41:25,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now I get it.

1168
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I admit to falling off over the past few years.

1169
01:41:28,985 --> 01:41:34,575
[SPEAKER_07]: For my mental health, I stopped consuming most gaming media when I moved into development.

1170
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:37,500
[SPEAKER_07]: That statement really struck me as well.

1171
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my immediate gut reaction was like, oh, I get it.

1172
01:41:42,068 --> 01:41:45,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if I worked in games, I'd have to cut out all that stuff too.

1173
01:41:45,735 --> 01:41:49,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I kind of took a step back and went, that's really sad.

1174
01:41:50,367 --> 01:41:57,920
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really sad that when you're in the industry, it's difficult to listen to these sorts of podcasts.

1175
01:41:58,301 --> 01:42:01,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't take that personally, even though I like to think we're a little more positive.

1176
01:42:02,047 --> 01:42:04,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do realize sometimes we do have our criticisms.

1177
01:42:05,553 --> 01:42:09,340
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also go, I understand the need to cut it cold turkey.

1178
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,383
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if we're the nice one.

1179
01:42:11,403 --> 01:42:12,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to cut it cold turkey.

1180
01:42:13,046 --> 01:42:14,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That comment really made me think.

1181
01:42:14,348 --> 01:42:16,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, damn.

1182
01:42:16,051 --> 01:42:21,162
[SPEAKER_07]: There's got to be a lot of folks that are in the industry that can't consume this kind of stuff.

1183
01:42:21,203 --> 01:42:22,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too hard to listen to.

1184
01:42:22,806 --> 01:42:24,550
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really sad.

1185
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finishes out the statement saying, but for years, this program was a weekly staple.

1186
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:32,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you so much for that and really appreciate the sentiment there.

1187
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:41,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been asked several times if we're going to take calls on the last show or people that are planning to call in on the last show.

1188
01:42:41,763 --> 01:42:45,731
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the spirit of what OLR is all about, we need to.

1189
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, that will be a thing we do.

1190
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: But please prepare yourself that the lightning round clock will be on.

1191
01:42:53,648 --> 01:42:59,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have to keep yourself succinct just because we want to allow all the people.

1192
01:42:59,357 --> 01:43:03,042
[SPEAKER_07]: For those that can't be here live, will we do something where you can submit a recording?

1193
01:43:03,603 --> 01:43:08,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will work on something in the coming weeks where you could submit something prerecorded.

1194
01:43:08,651 --> 01:43:11,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to try to make it easier than send an MP3.

1195
01:43:11,335 --> 01:43:15,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's some services where you could just record a voicemail with your mic and send it.

1196
01:43:15,501 --> 01:43:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to be able to do that for folks who are interested in that.

1197
01:43:19,187 --> 01:43:21,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But more details to come.

1198
01:43:21,290 --> 01:43:25,738
[SPEAKER_07]: and we will play those either on the last show or the show before.

1199
01:43:26,339 --> 01:43:29,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be taking the next day off.

1200
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:31,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Of work?

1201
01:43:31,648 --> 01:43:34,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm absolutely going to be taking the next day off.

1202
01:43:34,873 --> 01:43:36,396
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Thanksgiving week, right?

1203
01:43:37,490 --> 01:44:05,455
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1204
01:44:05,435 --> 01:44:10,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, SJ100Matt says we can make a Discord thread where folks can drop recordings and stuff, right?

1205
01:44:10,022 --> 01:44:10,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we could.

1206
01:44:11,484 --> 01:44:13,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I want to find an even easier way.

1207
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:18,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's websites that just like literally you just on your phone, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and send the message.

1208
01:44:18,675 --> 01:44:21,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll figure that out.

1209
01:44:21,379 --> 01:44:23,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll figure it out and get back to y'all.

1210
01:44:23,542 --> 01:44:28,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that, but of course, emails are great, too.

1211
01:44:28,668 --> 01:44:30,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1212
01:44:30,871 --> 01:44:32,333
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to hear from folks.

1213
01:44:34,215 --> 01:44:34,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Last-minute stories.

1214
01:44:34,936 --> 01:44:37,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, anything tonight?

1215
01:44:37,219 --> 01:44:45,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have anything, but I did want to mention, even though it's not this coming week, but the next week, the new Katamari game comes out.

1216
01:44:48,567 --> 01:44:50,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, counter-programming for Pokemon.

1217
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:52,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

1218
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:54,174
[SPEAKER_07]: There can be room for both.

1219
01:44:54,794 --> 01:44:56,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1220
01:44:57,117 --> 01:44:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with that, usually I have a spiel here.

1221
01:45:00,421 --> 01:45:07,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm going to be changing that here and just say that we just want to say thank you to everybody for your support over the years of this program.

1222
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:13,056
[SPEAKER_07]: This 1065 and counting episode legacy is thanks to all of you.

1223
01:45:13,036 --> 01:45:16,080
[SPEAKER_07]: and your support and being here for the show.

1224
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,141
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate it.

1225
01:45:17,702 --> 01:45:25,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And this last little final stretch here is really for you all and dedicated to all of you that kept OLR going over the years.

1226
01:45:25,532 --> 01:45:33,061
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate you and we hope you'll have a lot of fun here throughout the rest of this month and next as we wrap it up.

1227
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:37,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have more to say and a lot can change in the gaming industry in a couple weeks.

1228
01:45:37,727 --> 01:45:41,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope you'll still be here with us until the very bitter end.

1229
01:45:41,352 --> 01:45:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we're going to go around and get some final thoughts.

1230
01:45:44,657 --> 01:45:46,941
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, streaming tonight?

1231
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:47,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Straman?

1232
01:45:47,922 --> 01:45:49,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am.

1233
01:45:49,484 --> 01:45:54,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just had to turn off my emotions or else I would be overwhelmed.

1234
01:45:54,031 --> 01:45:54,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I understand.

1235
01:45:55,414 --> 01:45:57,116
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

1236
01:45:57,757 --> 01:45:58,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to TwitchCon.

1237
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:09,435
[SPEAKER_01]: So if any of y'all are at TwitchCon or in San Diego or at Disneyland on that Monday and you see me...

1238
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:10,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hi.

1239
01:46:11,387 --> 01:46:12,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll hang out.

1240
01:46:12,349 --> 01:46:16,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get some desserts and maybe a pretzel.

1241
01:46:17,998 --> 01:46:18,660
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1242
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1243
01:46:19,321 --> 01:46:19,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.

1244
01:46:20,523 --> 01:46:28,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a ton of fun at TwitchCon and we'll miss you next week, but I'm excited for you to be getting to do some networking and see people, IRL and all that good stuff.

1245
01:46:28,917 --> 01:46:30,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a blast.

1246
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:33,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going for the hangouts this time and maybe a little bit of work.

1247
01:46:34,225 --> 01:46:34,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1248
01:46:35,447 --> 01:46:35,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1249
01:46:35,548 --> 01:46:35,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1250
01:46:35,948 --> 01:46:36,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.

1251
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, then we're over to you.

1252
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:39,751
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your final thought for tonight?

1253
01:46:41,377 --> 01:46:41,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1254
01:46:42,059 --> 01:46:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep working on Minecraft stuff.

1255
01:46:43,846 --> 01:46:45,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't really have anything else to add.

1256
01:46:45,411 --> 01:46:46,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll play some different games.

1257
01:46:46,556 --> 01:46:47,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

1258
01:46:48,532 --> 01:46:54,799
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought for tonight is Pokemon Legends, my favorite Pokemon series because I loved the last game that much.

1259
01:46:55,299 --> 01:46:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Very excited to play the new one.

1260
01:46:56,561 --> 01:46:57,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't let me down.

1261
01:46:57,902 --> 01:46:59,804
[SPEAKER_07]: But I haven't been buying into the hype.

1262
01:47:00,124 --> 01:47:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited about it.

1263
01:47:02,267 --> 01:47:03,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great week, everybody.

1264
01:47:03,268 --> 01:47:07,372
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you next time on the 19th to talk about whatever might come out of TwitchCon.

1265
01:47:07,993 --> 01:47:10,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll hear from DarkSakura remotely.

1266
01:47:10,536 --> 01:47:15,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to promise that, but we can certainly make it available to them if they're able to call in or something.

1267
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of you about the weekend news.

1268
01:47:17,523 --> 01:47:39,497
[SPEAKER_04]: have a great week everybody, we'll see you next week, bye bye

1269
01:47:40,844 --> 01:47:50,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know they were all still true.

1270
01:47:53,295 --> 01:47:54,718
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.
