9650	10591	How do you do, Ken?
11112	18261	I would like one of your teriyaki burgers with egg, a sweet and sour fried chicken, a triple cheeseburger, and an overflowing energy McFizz.
18802	19783	Can I have all that to go?
20584	21506	Sure you can.
22827	24710	Puns with poor propunciation.
26032	28275	No, I'm not sorry.
28295	34483	Now it's time for your hosts, Robert Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the story behind this skit and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34503	36906	Starting right now with a show where every gamer has a voice.
38843	41567	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41588	45955	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45995	49240	And apparently you get dad jokes from our voiceover guy, Jason.
49641	51784	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
51844	60058	We are back once again tonight with episode number 1066 of our show for October the 19th of 2025.

67851	69033	Not for much longer though.
70415	78389	November 23rd is when we're going to be ending the 23 and a year, 23 and a half year run of this show.
78829	84679	Very bittersweet but excited for what might be in the future.
84659	111544	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

150877	175568	DarkSakura.com
175548	181636	I think there's no one better here at Orange Launch Radio to bring on the show to talk about this than the one and only Shane.
181696	182157	Hello.
183538	183939	Hello.
184379	186162	Live all the way from New Zealand, right?
187523	190848	Yeah, currently for another eight, eight, seven days.
190868	192189	So you you did it.
192270	198658	Some people talk about getting the hell out of the US with everything going on and you're living the dream.
198838	200380	I'm trying to live the dream.
200460	201201	It is not.
201586	220135	Like, fully there yet, but I'm working on it.
220115	223760	Yeah, yeah, I never went by my first name.
223840	224942	I hated my first name.
225022	226244	It's obviously not Shane.
226624	228207	Which is something you and I have in common.
228387	230370	You and I, I don't know how many listeners know this.
230490	231552	Rob is my middle name.
231572	233274	I don't go by my legal name ever.
233434	234276	So yeah.
235477	243129	Yeah, so I had this opportunity come up where I was supposed to move to Germany.
244090	248697	And I was like, you know what, let's just get rid of my first name and get something cool.
248777	248957	And
249629	270220	at my now old job we were talking about like names I could go with and I picked Seeger and got it you know legalized and everything went through the process it was annoying and then Germany fell through so now I just have a German first name even though I'm not German so whatever whatever it's fine it's fine
271347	275412	All right, but just to be clear, people can still call you Shane.
276474	278597	Yeah, honestly, either one works.
278697	284224	Whereas before, I would not talk to you ever again had you called me my first name.
284324	286427	Now, whoever you're comfortable with is fine.
286447	290132	Or in my case, he'd just give it right back, and then we both hate each other, so...
290112	291814	Yeah, there you go.
292295	292615	All right.
292736	293937	Well, okay.
294338	296981	So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon.
297122	299024	You are a Pokemon fan.
299084	308577	For our newer listeners, you know, if we have any, tell us about why you love Pokemon and kind of like what your love of the franchise sort of stems from.
310941	312643	That's a really deep question.
312809	317094	and kind of hard to articulate because I don't fully know the answer.
317694	324001	I can say that I think the games are just fun, like just on a very basic level.
324121	324561	That's fair.
324581	327124	Video games ought to be fun, huh?
327144	333651	They also scratch this itch I have of like hunting and collecting things.
333671	337155	Like as a kid, I'd go with my mom beanie baby hunting.
337175	338296	That was super fun to me.
338336	340318	We would do that for other toys and stuff.
340754	368618	and that is the objective of Pokemon so it's just a really good time for me and I like the designs I think the gameplay has always been good to solid so so Pokemon is just like Beanie Babies confirmed yes 100% easy okay um let's see so you there's kind of an infamous meme on this show about you and maybe it's Labubu's now actually are you into the Labubu thing
368952	376522	No, I hate them, and I didn't really know what they were until when I was in Japan a couple months ago.
377002	380226	My friend called me and asked me to find her some, like, why?
381268	390319	And then after she said that, literally everywhere I go, I see Labubus, and I hate it, and they're so weird, and they're not cute.
391025	393849	Yeah, they remind me of, was it Where the Wild Things Are?
394069	395671	Yeah, kind of.
395711	397714	I'm like, why are they making dolls of those?
398515	399396	I could see that.
400017	406606	The only Labubu I'm interested in is one I saw on TikTok today that was a sculpture that was entirely made out of bread.
407607	410251	It was LaCarbCarb, and I am so into that.
410591	411532	That sounds amazing.
413174	416919	Not to be a Labubu racist, but they all look the same.
417060	419563	I do not even know what the differences are.
420023	420424	Like,
421197	422399	Are there different ones?
422860	427810	Because they sure don't look like it.
427890	431877	Well, I know my husband is really into the blind boxes, but not the labubus.
431917	435624	But he likes to go to the pop mart and stuff and just kind of look around.
435644	438650	He likes some of that type of stuff, but not labubus, thankfully.
438951	443880	Sorry to go off on that tangent.
444248	445889	No, you were saying about something else.
446110	447111	No, you're fine, you're fine.
447151	461043	Oh, I was going to say the meme about you on this show is that you, so like when Pokemon, I don't know what it was, it was X or Y or something came out, you bought like eight copies of the game because you have to, well, I actually don't know why.
461083	464386	You have to have them in every region, every pairing.
464406	464486	No.
464506	465007	Okay.
465027	466628	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
466648	468250	Let's clear that up.
468270	469911	So... It was six copies.
469931	471893	The first, the first...
472683	486536	of the generations I bought, like, multiple versions besides just, you know, the standard, like, red and blue or X and Y or whatever, was Gen 7.
486797	493703	Because, funny enough, I was in New Zealand at the time, and I wanted to play the game.
494184	498247	And it was on 3DS, and it launched here, and I was like, okay, I'm going to go get a copy.
498308	498808	So I got
499160	502243	copies here, and then I got copies back when I was in the US.
502784	511754	It wasn't until Sword and Shield that I went insane and just started buying copies from every region.
512214	516038	When literally starting with Sword and Shield, it didn't matter anymore.
516459	524568	Whereas before, you'd have to buy a Japanese copy to play in Japanese, and so you could do the Masuda breeding.
526229	527631	Now it doesn't matter yet.
527982	530746	Now is the time I've started buying way too many copies.
531908	543647	So we had a brand new game come out this week, Pokemon Legends ZA, which, although technically not a mainline game, it does really feel like Pokemon Legends is an emerging mainline series.
543667	546792	Okay, well, is that just because it ties into X and Y, or what?
546812	550999	No, no, they said the Legends series is considered mainline.
551019	555306	It's a terrible, terrible, like, false information game.
555708	566427	I mean...
567132	568954	The creators say they're mainlines.
568994	571376	They can say whatever they want to sell more copies.
571396	571877	That's fine.
572257	580666	And to be fair, the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet obviously felt influenced by what they did with Pokemon Legends Arceus.
580746	583109	So there's something there, I guess.
583830	587573	So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Legends ZA.
587854	589576	You obviously have jumped in.
589756	592599	You have already beaten the game, correct?
592619	596683	Yes, I marathoned the crap out of this because I came prepared.
596883	626367	I bought the game digitally or pre-ordered it digitally while I was in Japan so I knew that I could start playing as soon as it went live on the Japanese servers and so I've been playing since what that would be my Wednesday my Wednesday no my Thursday early early morning which is your like Wednesday at some point in time I don't know
627123	631089	But yes, I just kind of marathoned it, like, really bad.
631990	633632	Okay, so how many hours did it take you to get through it?
635695	641724	Well, considering I didn't finish the decks, but I did do every side mission I possibly saw.
642665	646350	And I went around collecting the very gay screws.
647131	651257	And I did a lot of the Battle Royale stuff.
651845	654329	I ended at 47 hours.
654930	658777	Okay, but you did a lot of side missions and that's, you know, understandable.
658797	663145	I did every side mission that popped up, yes.
663165	666811	That's how I like to play the games too, so that's not terribly surprising.
666931	670277	So, and I've played the game for a little bit.
670297	673844	I streamed it the night it came out and then I've been playing more off stream.
673924	675827	I'm up to rank, I don't know,
675807	703570	So, I think...
704444	714534	In some weird way, Legends ZA captures the same addictive gameplay loop that Legends RCS does.
714554	715295	Or has, rather.
717437	730390	Instead of going and just catching things constantly, the catch things in the daytime, and then when it switches over to night, going to the ZA battle stuff, that's just really fun.
730530	732612	And it never overstays its welcome.
732862	744803	In fact, I'm constantly angry when it does switch over to either day or night because I'm having a good time doing the activities it wants me to do during those time periods.
745764	747708	That's actually kind of one of the issues I have.
748048	749551	I don't like the day-night mechanic.
749651	750573	I really don't.
750633	752997	I get it, but I just don't care for it.
754192	767205	but you can also avoid it mostly you can use the benches yeah with the benches you still have to engage with the mechanic but you don't have to let it like control you the entire aspect of your gameplay
767337	790528	question from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show we won't be here next week but we'll be back in two weeks I'll tell you more about that later but YYR is live in our chat asking is that longer or shorter than the first Legends game?
790548	796956	It's been a minute since I started Legends from scratch I would say just guessing
797341	807555	That this game is probably longer in the sense of start to finish if you're not doing like 100% completion.
807775	813463	Yeah, 47 sounds like a lot compared to Pokemon Legends or Saiyans.
813483	816767	But there was a very needed postgame.
817793	823002	My 47 hours is closer to 100% completion playstyle.
823503	830576	I saw people that beat this new game just rushing through it in under 20 hours.
830596	832579	So, I don't know.
832863	854156	I can't really answer if it's longer or shorter.
854176	856980	It's overhauled.
856960	886967	it's it well that's another reason to to it's weird to call it a mainline game but i suppose if this is what we're going to see in gen 10 as well then that's fine because i really like the combat system because it feels like like an action rpg now it feels like a i don't know like a kingdom hearts or a world of warcraft or something like they took the you know the four moves and they you know you you do them a little more like they have cooldowns and you use them live and it's it's interesting i really like it what how do you feel about the overhaul to the battle system
886947	888509	Oh, I love it.
888669	891832	I think it's so much more fun and far more engaging.
893954	903925	And it's also fun because things you expect having played this series for so many years, like they just don't work the same.
904065	910531	The moves that you know what they do in standard Pokemon games don't necessarily work the same way.
910611	914035	Like Protect is a short shield that
914470	925547	basically nothing can get through, but then it's on a cool down or toxic spikes used to be a trap where when new Pokemon would come in, they would be poisoned.
926147	937264	But in this game, you throw them on the ground and at any time your current or your current Pokemon or other ones you bring out could walk over them and get poisoned.
937284	942772	Or if you just stay far away, then you don't have to even deal with that trap.
942792	943093	Yeah.
943273	943313	So
943816	952908	It's putting a really fun twist on the not boring, but the tried and true gameplay.
953329	955075	And I think it's great.
956118	959084	Now, I'm pretty sure this is where you and I are going to disagree, and that's fine.
959144	963032	It's not like we don't disagree all the time, but I just don't like the city setup.
963152	963733	I'm going to be honest.
963813	965196	I just don't like the setting.
965597	971990	I don't like how they did the wild areas in the city, and I know you get more, and I've gotten to the point where I think I have 10 of them unlocked and stuff.
972050	973773	I just don't like the setting.
973793	975076	I don't like climbing the rooftops.
975196	976338	I don't like this.
976438	977721	It's just, it doesn't...
977701	981005	I don't know, it feels very weird to me, especially compared to the last game.
981125	983108	I really enjoyed the setting of the last game.
983408	987534	And I think there was a part of me that was just kind of yearning for more of that, to be quite honest.
987594	994983	And I understand, creatively, they gotta do different things to keep people interested in stuff, but I just don't like that creative direction.
995083	997687	But you enjoy it more.
999349	999729	Oh, 100%.
1000530	1006678	I think that being in a city lets you do a lot more...
1007249	1008650	focused activities.
1009291	1019060	It gives the developers, I almost say, more freedom to do fun things because you're not just looking at some giant blank map.
1019100	1021943	You've got structures you have to work around.
1022003	1024686	And I love the verticality.
1025326	1035636	I think it does a very good job of being in a Pokemon world that feels lived in versus a Pokemon world that has
1036392	1044485	What you would call a town, but literally is like two houses, but 10 people in that little village.
1044785	1045987	Does it feel lived in though?
1046007	1048972	Because I feel like there's a lot of stretches that are a little bit empty.
1049152	1054281	And then it's always like, oh, a cafe, another cafe, another cafe, another clothes shop.
1055002	1056324	There's only so many.
1056344	1057746	I think that's how it is in real life.
1057786	1058367	I think there...
1058937	1060279	That's such a lame excuse.
1060299	1064124	There's only so many archetypes of like actual things you find in the city.
1064484	1067108	There's just not a lot of variation in it.
1067188	1067528	I don't know.
1067789	1076240	Like I thought what the game was doing, I thought it was doing like a Final Fantasy VII thing where like the first segment would take place in the city and then we get to like go outside the city.
1076280	1080646	And when I found out that wasn't the case, I was kind of like, oh, well, that's kind of disappointing.
1081467	1083189	So I just, yeah.
1084310	1088556	It's all city, but there are some special places you do get to go.
1088958	1095144	So you will get to, you know, break up the monotony of looking at buildings constantly.
1095744	1097085	Why did they get rid of crafting?
1097105	1102210	I mean, I guess it was the crafting system in the last game was very, very, very basic.
1102270	1105573	So like, I'm not going to say like, oh my God, it was so complex and I loved it.
1105593	1118425	But like, I don't know, like it feels like all, when you run over these shiny things on the ground, not shiny Pokemon, but shiny little objects, they're all just like, they're either items you throw away in battle or things you sell for money.
1118405	1121990	and so I felt like... Oh, crafting made sense for Legends Arceus.
1122010	1126096	You're in a time period where Pokeballs are not a thing, really.
1126116	1130422	You're just starting to, you know, make them or they're being produced.
1131283	1137953	But in this game, you know, this is actually the farthest ahead in the timeline we are for the Pokemon world.
1138814	1142179	And, I don't know, crafting was kind of boring in the other game.
1142279	1146285	All it did was, you know, give you access to like Pokeballs.
1146653	1148055	That's what you use it for.
1148195	1154465	Here, go beat up some chumps in the Royale one night and you get, I'm getting like $150,000.
1154926	1157990	Yeah, it's just money on Pokeballs.
1158070	1158872	Yeah, I don't know.
1158932	1161235	It just seems like it's just, I don't know.
1161255	1163559	It's just like, I don't want to say lazy.
1163599	1166844	Lazy is not the right word, but I don't know if like this, it's almost too streamlined.
1166864	1167405	I think that's it.
1167685	1169708	It's too streamlined for me.
1169688	1196725	I don't know like again I don't dislike the game I'll finish it it's it's engaging enough but I was just kind of I don't know maybe I after the last Pokemon Legends game I just had the bar set a little higher you know I don't know but for me we didn't really have I mean all we had was Arceus so we don't really know what a Legends series looks like yet yeah but I do know that I liked Arceus when I first play it better than this one when I first played it that I do know
1198173	1201137	Minus the graphics part.
1201197	1206765	Obviously, that part is nice that it runs really smooth at 60 frames a second and all that.
1206885	1218320	Although, I'm sure you've seen how critical some people are of some of the, I don't know, lack of three-dimensional texturing, we'll say, when it comes to some of those buildings and things of that.
1218340	1220383	Like, I don't...
1220363	1225268	I think some people are being a little sensational when they call it copy-paste terrain and things like that.
1225668	1227830	I think it feels a little more alive than that.
1227850	1235457	But I would agree that Game Freak feels behind a lot of their peers when it comes to pushing the envelope with graphics.
1237379	1240001	I can agree with that.
1240502	1243665	I don't agree with the people just constantly harping on it.
1244465	1249510	One, if you're harping on it, you saw the leaked budgets for these games.
1249709	1279598	kind of makes sense why it looks the way it does but also I don't think a flat textured building is going to take away from the fun I have with the game unless I have to like I don't know climb the building and only look at the building and that's all I do is just look at buildings the entire time which I don't in this game yeah they're the scenery but I'm looking at the ground I'm looking at the sky I'm in Pokemon battles those are
1279949	1281776	I don't know.
1282639	1290567	It's very annoying to be a fan of almost anything now and just realize that
1290952	1298759	There are going to be people out there that are going to make bad faith arguments and just be so loud about it when you just want to have fun with your game.
1298779	1299480	Here's the problem.
1299500	1300781	I'm going to call it like it is.
1300801	1301802	I'm going to call it like it is.
1302463	1304805	People use Pokemon for views.
1305166	1306587	That's what it is.
1306907	1311111	They are using Pokemon and its popularity to go on these tirades.
1311372	1317077	I saw this video that was just like super negative on the whole thing today with 69,000 views.
1317057	1320823	That is like – and that's probably small fries and that stuff.
1320843	1323286	Like it's very – it's just wild to me.
1323346	1324849	Like the people will shit on it.
1324869	1333922	But it's because of the nature of algorithms and that somebody else controls your algorithm in almost all social media except for one, Blue Sky.
1334022	1335925	Oh, and Mastodon to be fair.
1336446	1339591	And it's these algorithms.
1339611	1343296	And so it keeps pushing you that negativity to rage bait you into engagement.
1343637	1343757	Right?
1343737	1370166	that's literally what Elon Musk bought X to do was to turn it into rage bait engagement so yeah anyway let's see going to our comments in chat Deft in chat says I haven't played Z to A but the battles seem really cool now turn base for me for the most part is really boring hence why I like stuff like Mario RPG because it gives you something to do and I want Pokemon to look good the game can look whatever
1370669	1373733	Oh yeah, and the Pokemon do look good.
1374093	1383384	They lack the really defined textures of the Scarlet Violet Pokemon, but they still look amazing.
1383404	1394397	And the new Megas, which I won't spoil, literally probably the most... I think they're all great.
1394677	1397200	I think all the new Megas are great, and...
1397602	1400707	I'll just leave it at that because I don't want to spoil things for people.
1401448	1405996	Fifth Dream in chat is talking about I'm always a turn-based guy.
1406096	1406897	I want that back.
1407017	1408800	Real time is too hectic.
1408820	1412927	Is there any way to slow the battles down or do anything like if you...
1413295	1414437	I could see that.
1415198	1428837	Remember when Final Fantasy XV made that change to action and because of all the feedback or whatever you want to call it, they actually added a mode in XV that would stop.
1429058	1435727	Basically, it would stop the clock every time your cooldown reset so you had time to really think about your next move.
1435808	1439573	Final Fantasy XV kind of had that, but Pokemon Legends doesn't have anything like that, right?
1440481	1465999	no you have to kind of think ahead um you can do stuff like make the other Pokemon drowsy or paralyze it or freeze it and that gives you some breathing room or and that's in battles in um or trainer battles if you're doing like wild battles if you need just like a minute to think toss out a couple Pokeballs at the Pokemon and even if it doesn't catch you still get
1466468	1470775	A little bit of time to just kind of process, you know, what you want to do next.
1471356	1473339	Okay, you're going to rage at this comment.
1473359	1473920	You ready, Shane?
1474762	1479930	Bobby in chat says, and that's why I'm glad the Legends series is a spinoff and not a mainline game.
1479950	1482615	The mainline games can still be turn-based.
1482635	1490127	As much as I can see the steam coming out of your ears, I do want to go back to the point about, wait a minute, could the mainline games go this direction?
1490147	1492611	Do you think the mainline games are going to go this direction?
1492591	1502740	So first of all, Bobby's comment is clearly him just quoting something from a Ragebait video that is grounded in nonsense.
1503541	1505483	Not grounded at all.
1505963	1510227	Secondly, did you guys talk about the Pokemon leaks on the show?
1510387	1511068	It's coming up.
1511088	1513350	I actually wanted to keep you around to talk about that.
1513370	1516293	So if you want to get into that a little bit, yes.
1516433	1517694	I'll touch on it for a second.
1518575	1522058	Supposedly in the leaks, the next generation...
1522325	1528811	Gen 10 will have an option for turn-based or not turn-based.
1528831	1529772	Oh, interesting.
1530713	1539521	Whether that's the same as the action we're getting in this game or something completely different.
1539581	1542003	That's literally what Fifth Dream is asking for.
1542023	1545326	So that's kind of interesting.
1545346	1545647	Huh.
1546327	1551572	There's also Pokemon's in a weird place because
1552193	1558460	This game was supposed to come out last year, and then this year would have been Gen 10.
1559001	1562705	And so now they also have that other game coming out, Champions.
1562725	1566530	And that's where Competitive is going to be played now, is on Champions.
1567090	1576902	So realistically, since Champions is just the turn-based 2v2 fights, and that's all,
1577742	1590576	They could do whatever they wanted with any of the games from here on out because they've got their competitive game and that's what they care about for the turn-based style.
1592118	1594761	Fifth Dream in chat says, Pokopia is the real future.
1595241	1596843	How do you feel about that one?
1596903	1599586	Because everybody says Pokemon Minecraft.
1599606	1601048	I feel like that's the wrong take.
1601068	1605032	Pokemon Dragon Quest Builders, that's the right take, at least from what we know so far.
1605569	1610785	Yeah, it is Pokemon Dragon Quest Builders because it's made by the same team that made Dragon Quest Builders.
1610805	1611367	I didn't realize.
1611407	1613012	I actually legit didn't realize that.
1613694	1614938	Oh, well, that makes a lot of sense.
1615018	1615299	Okay.
1617085	1617165	Hmm.
1617871	1640875	But, yeah.
1640855	1664196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1665661	1670846	Yeah, this is all from the huge leak that happened, was it last year?
1671007	1671747	Yeah.
1671767	1675411	Where we got some data forms, lots of internal documents.
1675431	1677674	This is way beyond rumor.
1677874	1684040	This is like, it could change from the day it was leaked, but this is the direction it's going in.
1685442	1692930	Well, and just to show how things can change, ZA was not a Kalos game to start with.
1693450	1694031	So...
1694787	1723630	that right there kind of shows you nothing is set in stone but I already forgot the question so I just like generally how do you feel how do you feel about the leaked things like with the direction that Pokemon's going when you read about that I'm fine I'm on board I have always been on board with the games it seems with the exception of a couple Gen 10 sounds promising but
1724352	1732541	will have to see if they can deliver on the ambition that is in those documents.
1733302	1747539	The next Legends game I am excited for, but I'm also very apprehensive because it's just yet another twist in the formula.
1748420	1750602	And I don't know if I'm going to like that twist.
1750622	1753245	But to be fair, going into ZA,
1753664	1780768	I didn't know if I would like the combat in this game with its huge focus and it's it's kind of like playing Hades for me or Hades 2 I get into a fight I go I go at night and I'm like okay I just want to do it one more time I want to go through the entire like area and go beat people up and I just oh I can't can't stop playing that but um
1781423	1790066	I'm excited for the Legends game just based on the region it's based because it sounds like it'll be more like the last Legends game, but it probably won't.
1790086	1791310	It's going to do its own thing, I'm sure.
1793696	1794117	Uh...
1794569	1795049	Maybe.
1795730	1799494	I guess we'll have to see if any of those documents actually pan out.
1799594	1801576	Yeah, yeah, because it's all subject to change.
1801816	1805960	I am very curious about, and I have a hard time grasping what this is.
1805980	1817971	So there is some game, a new game in there that leaked that is, some are saying it's a Pokemon MMO, and some are saying it's like some interesting combo of the first four regions all together.
1818291	1821494	What is that from what you know?
1821734	1823496	Basically what you just said.
1823662	1826025	I don't know anything more than that.
1826065	1826645	Okay, that's fine.
1828207	1829949	You probably read these documents more than I did.
1830029	1830630	I didn't.
1830650	1832952	I just kind of went, oh, interesting.
1832972	1835355	I screenshot it and sent them to you, I remember.
1835915	1837197	And I read them once.
1837437	1838218	And that's about it.
1838378	1839319	I have not gone back.
1839419	1840240	I thought there was more.
1840320	1844865	I thought the Reddit or whatever you were looking at had way more info than just what you sent me.
1845186	1845906	Oh, interesting.
1845926	1846027	Okay.
1846047	1848069	No, that was really it.
1848089	1850952	And I mean, kind of to be like,
1851927	1856251	somewhat respectful, if you can even call it that, to the developers.
1856271	1861695	I don't want to just read what they don't intend other people to read.
1861756	1864318	Yeah, and I'm not going to make any... And I'm not going to get my hopes up.
1864558	1867841	And I'm not going to make any decisions about these games based on this leak.
1867861	1872085	This is just one of those like, oh, but we can't ignore that it happened either.
1872565	1874447	Like, it's just, it's out there now.
1876048	1881833	Here's something that's interesting about the leaks is that prior to this latest round of leaks...
1882049	1907533	uh we were told via the leakers that um gen 10 would take place in Greece like a Greece uh region and not only because of the new leak did we find out that that was an option but we found out that's not even remotely true and it's a completely different like place so
1908391	1913295	I don't want to get I don't want to read this stuff and get my hopes up and then just be like crushed.
1913677	1914300	I gotcha.
1914854	1919561	We'll leave that to the three-hour rage bait YouTubers that are talking about how all these games are the worst thing ever.
1919902	1921604	And I don't know.
1921905	1922706	You know all the things.
1922766	1925490	Microsoft needs to buy Pokemon or something like that, whatever they say.
1926572	1927753	I know.
1928314	1929857	Yeah.
1929997	1931119	People are unhinged online.
1932721	1938650	So another question in chat from Mr. 200 Matt who's asking, so you've beaten ZA now.
1938870	1940693	Is it just Shining Hunting now?
1942293	1952324	No, because the shiny charm is not even locked behind dex completion, but is locked behind a lot of other stuff I still have to do.
1953345	1962976	And honestly, I don't know if I'm at the point with this game where I feel like I want to just go out and shiny hunt.
1963256	1966900	I want to go and make more teams.
1966920	1970764	I want to keep fighting in the ZA battles.
1971031	1971792	at night.
1973734	1976197	I want to do the online more.
1976237	1987891	That's actually fun and I have to do it on all my accounts I play on because of the stupid Mega Greninja stone being locked behind it and then the other starters each season.
1987911	1990374	You have to do PvP to do that?
1990394	1994539	You have to but you don't have to win your fights.
1994739	1998484	It's a point-based system to rank up.
1998504	1999485	I guess that sounds bad.
2000123	2010237	and if you look at a guide it will tell you like what you can do to earn points because it is very important to know you can go into a fight and lose points overall.
2010257	2027700	I did that one fight so that sucked but if you do specific actions or play specific ways and don't get first place you can still earn quite a few points and you can probably get your rank K is where you get the Greninja Stone
2028068	2041286	Probably within an hour, hour and a half at most And that's with bad Pokemon, that's not being like max level or anything Alright, good to know Let's see, what else do I ask you about at this point?
2041767	2043229	Are you still playing Pokemon Go?
2045352	2053283	Yes, I just did the Rayquaza, or the Mega Rayquaza weekend
2053702	2056648	a couple days ago because I didn't have a shiny yet.
2057169	2059093	So I got three.
2059113	2060115	I was happy with that.
2060135	2061056	Nice.
2061878	2073641	And being in locations outside of the US, it is far more fun to play Pokemon Go because you can actually just kind of walk everywhere and have a good time.
2073681	2074483	And people are playing.
2074783	2076807	God, here in New Zealand,
2077090	2082637	I'm sure it's mostly spoofers, but as soon as a raid hour starts, everything is full.
2082657	2086102	It does not matter because this is the first time zone.
2086122	2089166	Oh yeah, it's all the people trying to see the early time zone.
2089186	2091049	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2091109	2098479	Which is great for me because I can go outside and walk and there's nobody there, but I'm still at a 20 person fight and it's great.
2099981	2104667	Back in Japan, there's all the events constantly over there and
2104968	2107391	Yeah, it's just far more fun.
2108972	2113617	Well, thank you for coming on and sharing about Legends EA and that you're enjoying it.
2113757	2119664	How do you feel about the DLC that they're already announced for that?
2119864	2129394	I feel like that's just another rage bait topic because tons of games announced DLCs before their primary game come out.
2129694	2133338	And so I'm happy there's DLC.
2133908	2138799	I don't think it's wrong to announce DLC before your game actually comes out.
2139600	2141565	People don't understand how game development works.
2141585	2145794	I saw people say, that just means they took out stuff from the main game.
2145814	2147698	No, that's not.
2147999	2173956	Yeah, if they were like...
2174594	2176576	The story stops halfway through the game.
2176776	2180980	You can only get to rank C and you need DLC to get the rest.
2181081	2182682	Yeah, that would be shitty.
2182702	2183103	You know what?
2183703	2185605	That's totally understandable at that point.
2185625	2194254	But if you give me a game that has a start and then a finish, and that's a complete story, give me DLC.
2195055	2197037	If I like the game, I'll pick it up.
2197057	2200500	And you better believe I already pre-ordered it for...
2201662	2205967	One of my copies I have of this game so far.
2206788	2212974	Yeah, no, sadly those new megas and that have already leaked too, which is such a bummer.
2212994	2215457	But at least it's something to look forward to.
2217700	2221784	You know, before we let you go tonight, you know, OLR is going to end next month.
2222565	2225408	It's only 3pm almost, it's not tonight.
2225776	2226717	And it's Monday.
2226737	2227958	You're doing it on the wrong day.
2228078	2228539	Whatever.
2228839	2238450	Look, the fact that this show is going to end next month and you've been around since like the double digits, you know, early, early on in this.
2238530	2240992	First off, thank you for being a part of the show for so long.
2241233	2250062	And, you know, when you did have your ins in the game development industry, I remember you brought us like a brand new DDR song that people hadn't heard before.
2250042	2272860	and we were able to play that for people and that was a big way for us to kind of like catch traction on DDR Freak and all that so I really appreciate that but like you know kind of this is probably the last time you're going to be on the show since it's ending next month anything like that you look back on and go that was that was a lot of fun at OLR anything that you kind of like good memories of the show that you remember?
2273920	2274781	Yeah, I'll do two.
2274981	2279885	I will piggyback off what you just said for the first one.
2280386	2285610	So yes, I brought Echo Image.
2285750	2287372	I think that was the big get.
2287472	2288092	You did.
2288673	2293257	I think it's fine for me to say this now.
2293737	2293917	No?
2294038	2294298	Okay.
2296820	2303826	But piggybacking off that, I wouldn't have been able to
2304363	2315620	get that experience in the game industry probably without OLR because knowing you guys got me the connections I needed to get to Konami.
2316060	2318824	So that's something I will always be thankful for.
2319205	2319766	Never thought of that.
2320026	2321789	Thank you.
2321809	2330742	And then the other thing I will say is I don't really have a specific memory of like
2330975	2331997	Oh, that was awesome.
2332077	2343714	But I remember back in the early, early days when doing the show felt kind of like just a random get together slash house party.
2344335	2350464	And those episodes were always fun because it was just like hanging out with friends, talking about stuff you liked.
2351166	2355212	Wasn't so rigid in what we had to talk about.
2355252	2356994	If something came up, it came up.
2357014	2357455	It was fun.
2359628	2388943	Alright, well have fun with Pokemon Legends and I don't know you don't really create content anymore so I'd ask where people could find you Japan, hopefully I'll be there in 8 days You don't want to be found No, no, you want to go to the Taito Arcade and we'll go play some what is the newest 2DX it just came out as I left we'll just go play Pinky Crush or something
2389463	2391974	All right.
2392296	2395711	Well, thanks for taking time out of your day to join us, Shane.
2395731	2396595	And take care.
2396676	2397138	Take care.
2397178	2399187	Thanks again for all the support over the years.
2400230	2425039	sure thing goodbye bye talk to you later well he just like hung right up all right uh thank you Shane for uh participating on the show and YYR in chat says Sparkle Shower was the name of that 2DX game the new one all right it could literally been anything especially I don't think there's any conventions anymore with that stuff uh let's get into our gaming weeks Loki how was your gaming week
2425390	2442572	um it was mainly just Minecraft stuff I edited together one of my videos put that out and then um I was watching like some of the MCC Twitch Rivals stuff uh today just catching up on that because I'm out there oh that's fun that's good that's good you can watch that yeah
2443193	2443754	All right, let's see.
2444154	2448098	My gaming week, mostly Pokemon Legends ZA, since we were already talking about that.
2448158	2452042	But also a little bit of Diablo 4 still on this season.
2452163	2456888	And boy, oh boy, I'm having a really good time with the Hydra Mage because she's really overpowered.
2457288	2458269	But I'm loving it.
2458289	2459591	So it's a lot of fun.
2459631	2461493	Very satisfying on that front.
2461733	2464616	But that's really the bulk of what I've been playing this week.
2464996	2467419	Did I talk about Luminous Arise last week?
2467479	2469341	I can't remember if that demo... I don't think you did.
2469501	2469741	Okay.
2470282	2470382	Okay.
2470362	2490058	DarkSakura
2490038	2494047	They took everything from like Tetris Effect and just made it Luminous.
2494068	2504953	And obviously like, you know, the songs are different and the themes are different, but it's very, very much like, like literally like instead of doing a sequel to Tetris Effect, we just decided to kind of do the same thing with Luminous.
2505013	2507018	But like, why...
2507133	2510299	Fix a formula that doesn't need fixing, like, honestly.
2510439	2511821	Like, so I'm not complaining.
2511861	2512743	That's not a complaint.
2512763	2514747	That's actually, I think, a very smart thing for them to do.
2515428	2517191	I'm really excited to try it in VR.
2517211	2519135	I guess the demo actually isn't available in VR.
2519615	2524484	I was hoping I could go over to a friend's house and check it out on his headset, but I wasn't able to do that.
2524925	2527730	But I did enjoy the – it's only like a three-stage.
2527750	2530575	Like, it's the first little section.
2530555	2531477	I still enjoyed it.
2531878	2537589	I guess maybe my one complaint, it's almost a little bit too visually stimulating.
2537669	2542859	It's almost overwhelming visually, and I do hope there's a way to turn that down.
2542879	2543721	That would be my thing.
2544967	2569708	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2569688	2570689	However, that's it.
2570709	2571891	That's the last show we're going to miss.
2572031	2577059	And then we come back the week after in early November, and there will be four shows.
2577179	2579562	And then the last show will be November 23rd.
2579582	2582747	So episode 1070 is the last show.
2582847	2590158	Although I'm tempted to call the last show OLR the final, so that way our last episode number is 1069.
2590358	2591941	I think that's the way we ought to do it.
2592321	2592962	So...
2595490	2596331	Alright.
2596351	2596732	I like that.
2597232	2597653	Perfect.
2597913	2598634	It's done then.
2598654	2598975	Alright.
2600377	2601939	Let's get into some gaming news.
2601959	2602900	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2602980	2603721	I have to run downstairs.
2603741	2606225	I'm sorry to leave you by yourself, but I have to run downstairs real quick.
2607126	2607667	Yeah, no problem.
2608508	2621266	So anyways, I think we've heard about this lawsuit with Tencent and Sony over Tencent's game, Light of Motiram, I guess.
2622087	2622848	It's...
2622828	2632970	It's a very clearly inspired, maybe not legally distinct enough, according to Sony, version of Horizon Zero Dawn, at least aesthetically.
2633452	2638643	I don't think it plays the same, obviously, but it has to do with this whole...
2638977	2647347	Techno Tribal, you know, robot dinosaurs type thing that is very iconic with the Horizon series.
2648088	2653754	And of course, now there's still this legal battle going on, and we have some more details regarding that.
2654895	2666689	One of which, of course, is that apparently Tencent was just using the possibility of this game to lure Sony into meetings so it could pitch...
2667091	2683699	Not only Light of Motrium, it says aka Project Z, the Horizon Zero Dawn game, but also that it could possibly pitch a Last of Us type of game as well.
2683814	2685337	So that's interesting.
2685758	2702109	Another thing that comes out of this, and one of the reasons why they're trying to seek a preliminary injunction on the game itself, is because it is not set to release until 2027, which is also about the same time the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is planned.
2702850	2703932	Um...
2703912	2708058	I think that was officially announced at one point, but we didn't know too much about it.
2708619	2716550	But it is in development with Columbia Pictures, and apparently that they have a working script and they were searching for a director.
2717692	2723661	And right now I'm planning on releasing it in 2027, shooting it next year.
2723681	2725363	And then, of course...
2726525	2736058	You know, with that, the worry, I guess, is that this comes out, the people are going to see this game by Tencent and go, hey, that's a Horizon game.
2736138	2736859	I'm going to play that.
2737339	2737900	But it's not.
2738241	2739362	It's not a Horizon game.
2739402	2742446	But don't we have games that kind of look like other games all the time?
2742887	2743467	You know what I mean?
2744108	2752279	Like, okay, me saying that Lego game that you were showing at the top of the show live on Twitch was Minecraft something at first.
2752299	2754422	Like, games kind of look like other games sometimes.
2754402	2758210	Yeah, but I think in this case, you know, Lego has its own look.
2758230	2759172	I mean, I get it.
2759232	2760475	It's blocky and stuff.
2760835	2767990	You could say, oh, well, this is ripping off Mario Party, but Mario Party doesn't or at least
2768476	2773803	Maybe Nintendo would think that it owns the copyright to that, to the party game genre.
2774664	2775825	They do not own that.
2775985	2782834	And I remember like, hey, back in the day, back in the 90s and stuff, like every fighting game, oh, that's just a Street Fighter clone.
2782974	2784536	That's just a ripoff of Street Fighter.
2784556	2786338	Oh, that's a ripoff of Mortal Kombat.
2786839	2790343	So like, it's hard to say.
2790483	2795470	Remember when Beatmania came out in the US and G4 said it was a ripoff of Guitar Hero?
2795750	2795850	Yeah.
2796168	2798897	Well, they're stupid, but that's ridiculous.
2801364	2808928	That's just ill-informed people that, yes, they look similar, but... Ill-informed people on my internet?
2810039	2817667	It's like, you're acting as, like, news broadcasters, and you don't research your stories?
2817767	2818728	What?
2819089	2823474	I mean, I guess you could say they're entertainers, and they were just mainly hosting.
2823514	2826317	They have people behind the scenes that are... Doesn't matter.
2826637	2831142	Something happened, it, you know, they look silly about it, and hey, you know what?
2831382	2838730	It's sad to, you know, admit, but that mistake cost them G4, so you gotta be careful on those facts.
2839469	2842195	But yeah, so I don't know.
2842917	2843899	We'll see where this goes.
2844380	2845283	This is legal stuff.
2845423	2846545	They worry about that stuff.
2846886	2848290	Horizon is its own thing.
2848310	2849873	The Tencent game I don't want to play.
2851958	2852098	Eh.
2854143	2857090	I agree that gamers can also...
2857424	2862851	The gaming community has this certain sense of being able to smell out quality a lot of the times, right?
2862871	2863592	Well, exactly.
2863873	2870322	Especially, like, it's different when you have a game like Power World where you're like, oh, that looks like Pokemon.
2870342	2874247	But then you're like, wait, the gameplay is completely different.
2874267	2878172	And I think it does look a little close to Pokemon.
2878413	2881176	You know, it's like, except it has, like, guns and stuff in it.
2881317	2882979	But it's a bit close.
2883039	2885963	But this is also kind of riding that line of, like,
2886365	2894556	That looks pretty close, but at the same time, does Sony own the patent on that type of environment?
2895398	2900705	No, but are the designs of the creatures very similar to the Horizon game?
2900945	2905892	Maybe a little too much, but that's for a judge to figure out.
2906783	2907604	All right.
2907624	2910849	And a judge will figure it out, I'm sure, in the coming seven years.
2911490	2911831	All right.
2913954	2919783	Let's move on and talk about an Intellivision console that's actually going to be coming out.
2920324	2922047	That's pretty exciting.
2922267	2926774	We're going to be getting the Intellivision Spirit, and it's coming to us from Atari.
2926854	2930640	Because remember, folks, Atari bought Intellivision.
2930680	2933044	So now they're making things sort of happen.
2933024	2955454	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2955434	2975485	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2975465	2979750	Maybe it smells like an Intellivision and it has an HDMI port.
2979770	2987720	That's very similar to what this is, except instead of there is no cartridge port, it's going to have 45 built-in games.
2987740	2993226	So it's maybe a little bit more like a flashback console, which by the way, I bought one of those like Intellivision.
2993446	2994468	Was it Intellivision flashback?
2994508	2995128	I think it was.
2995168	2999834	It actually came with a little plastic overlay cards like this one does.
2999854	3002417	I bought one in like 2018 or 2019.
3002397	3010371	So like for me, this isn't exactly new, but maybe it's a little bit like you're kind of getting it more from the source, I guess.
3010431	3017203	But it's not, I don't, I really feel like what's this got that the last one I bought didn't have besides maybe some different games.
3018004	3023754	And I don't know, maybe it's sturdier because the last one was pretty cheaply made, but it was, it ran fine.
3025217	3025317	Yeah.
3025820	3028966	So yeah, Intellivision Spirit is going to cost $150.
3029026	3033154	That's the other difference is the price.
3033254	3034636	I think the one I bought was $80.
3035338	3038183	And I don't know if that's tariffs or what, but that's wild.
3038203	3039385	$150.
3039545	3039886	God.
3040447	3040747	All right.
3040848	3046478	Pre-orders are available now and you can check that out on December 5th.
3046458	3048302	This is so interesting.
3048322	3062914	And then this article I'm looking at right now ends with saying, it's a good thing it's not going to be vaporware like Intellivision's Amico, completely failing to point out Intellivision and Amico no longer have anything to do with each other.
3066978	3072825	Anyway, I have to say at that price, I'm not interested in this console.
3072845	3075948	It's not bringing anything new to the table that I didn't already buy a few years ago.
3077129	3081334	Bobby says a wireless controller is the big thing that's different.
3081354	3083497	Okay, that's, yeah.
3083517	3085779	YYR says that's more than I would have expected.
3085919	3094369	Same, but I have a feeling that our, you know, idiot in chief and the plans to, you know,
3095632	3100400	Tax the American People with Tariffs, which are just taxes, plays into that a little bit.
3102042	3107591	Travis C78 in chat says, I still have the Intellivision and all the games my dad came home with when I was seven.
3107972	3108773	Nostalgia hit.
3109113	3111758	Yeah, I mean, like the Intellivision was a fine console.
3111778	3114101	Like, you know, it was that competitor, the Atari 2600.
3114201	3117066	It had some pretty good bangers on it for the time.
3117046	3139257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3139338	3163523	I'll be curious to see how this sells when we've kind of seen a very similar thing so many times But it didn't seem to stop the Atari, like Atari's been tapping that nostalgic keg for a very long time and it's worked So why shouldn't it work for Intellivision I guess?
3164363	3166406	2018 was seven years ago at this point.
3167147	3170212	I guess that's almost, you know, a lot of changes since then.
3170633	3172576	All right, let's move on.
3172616	3172877	Loki.
3174159	3174519	All right.
3175321	3179367	Well, Nintendo has suffered a leak.
3179387	3188402	But apparently, well, they claim that nothing was leaked following a recent hack attempt by the hacker group Crimson Collective.
3189043	3190405	However...
3191431	3218687	there's been like they said that no personal data or personal or dev related info was leaked but I don't know so we will not be getting information about the next five years of releases out of Nintendo from this is what you're saying I guess not from Nintendo it's kind of weird because I equate the Pokemon company as Nintendo so it's like oh but that leaked but I guess it's not so but hey at least nothing leaked there
3219275	3221622	I can't say the same for other... Yeah.
3221762	3224229	Yeah, your names, passwords, and credit cards didn't leak, so that's good.
3224490	3226295	At least I don't have to get my ID to Nintendo.
3227760	3228081	So, that's good.
3228101	3229926	Oh my god, that's a whole... Oh my god.
3230347	3232373	Whole other... Whole other thing.
3232927	3233769	All right.
3235192	3243572	With laws in the world, this is interesting because this is coming out of Mexico and it's the whole violent video game debate coming back all over again.
3244174	3245416	But this was in a different way.
3245437	3250328	It's not that Mexico is looking to ban violent video games.
3250308	3271388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3271368	3275555	tried to pass a law that GameStop wouldn't be able to sell violent video games.
3275615	3284550	And it ended up flopping in court because there was no... The line of what is a violent video game was too blurred.
3284590	3286553	It was too open to interpretation.
3286613	3289157	It was too... You couldn't...
3289846	3314723	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3314703	3318968	and that would be extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content.
3319008	3320970	I'm assuming that's like a Mortal Kombat game.
3320990	3330140	That's going to be a C. A D rating is adults only and that's what they call prolonged scenes that include similar content.
3330501	3335607	So I am taking that to mean a C is like an M rating and a D is like an AO rating.
3336147	3341233	I'm sure there's probably more nuance to it than that but that's enough to help you understand what's going on.
3341213	3345478	This is actually something that dates back to being first proposed back in September.
3346599	3359334	And they're trying to use the old line about, oh, well, you know, there's a parallel with violent video games and making teenagers more... If you say so.
3359354	3359714	Anyway.
3361196	3369786	It should be noted that this whole report that it is based in, this is a study from 2012.
3370019	3371141	In a footnote.
3371161	3378214	And it also has some positive associations with games like resilience, motor learning, things of that sort.
3378514	3381600	So anyway, this would apply.
3381640	3388652	What is also interesting about this, this is going to be a tax applied to digital and physical copies of the affected games.
3388632	3397205	This still has to be cleared through the Senate in Mexico, and then it's going to be debated on November 15th before the budget proposal goes forward.
3397526	3401752	I guess maybe that's another interesting thing is that it ties into a budget proposal, right?
3401792	3403435	So it's not like an independent law.
3403815	3412108	They're basically saying in order to have the money into the economy, we're going to add a tax here to do that.
3412088	3426148	Deft Deft
3426787	3427428	Yeah, fair enough.
3427468	3429911	I figured that's how it was.
3431613	3435979	Yeah, and it makes me wonder if they could do something similar here.
3436980	3439804	And I realize we had the Supreme Court thing.
3439824	3440224	I know.
3440244	3441266	I know you probably said, no, they can't.
3441286	3442367	It's already been fought at the Supreme Court.
3442387	3444890	Well, number one, Supreme Court's different now.
3444910	3451278	Number two, the fact that it hinges on that ESRB board rating is interesting.
3451659	3453261	And that it's a tax, not a ban.
3453922	3455904	That's also interesting.
3455924	3456405	So...
3457904	3461215	We'll see what, as if you're not paying enough for video games right now.
3462123	3464866	No, we need to pay more for video games.
3464886	3465988	They want $100 video games.
3466068	3476080	Can you imagine if now you had to pay another 8% on top of... And to be fair, this is what they're looking at in Mexico, and I feel bad because... And Def shared with us this on the show before.
3476741	3482287	It's very hard to get consoles a lot of times in Mexico if the console hasn't officially been released in that region.
3482808	3485311	So yeah, and Def says video games are already expensive here.
3485411	3486052	Exactly.
3486072	3488535	So like an 8% tax is like...
3488515	3515940	Why do video games at all?
3515920	3535348	Or you just go PC and then you have like, you know Stupid CEOs are like, my game's never going down in price soon So you just got to shell out that $80 if you're a true fan And then a month later it goes down 30% Is that what happened with Borderlands 4?
3536049	3537811	Oh, I don't know, did it?
3537992	3542518	I think I know, I picked it up for 30% off So
3544152	3550923	So that's just so weird how that game that never was going to dip in price just dipped in price like all games do.
3551063	3555230	So maybe Randy Pitchford doesn't know anything.
3555851	3557013	I think we've already covered that.
3557594	3557955	All right.
3558956	3561300	Loki, one more here before the classic game.
3561618	3563482	Yep, this is pretty cool.
3563942	3565405	I wish we could get those over here.
3565485	3571217	But there is, in Japan, McDonald's Japan is doing a tie-in with Street Fighter.
3571958	3580294	And they have specific street burgers with these really funny 16-bit commercials or videos that they're making for this stuff.
3581196	3581837	Um...
3581817	3603876	that are pretty awesome looking and they they've got one that's a it's a teriyaki burger with egg on it uh sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich it sounds good and a triple cheeseburger I like the videos I really wish they had a version of Street Fighter with the hamburger attacks in there so it'd be amazing
3605780	3606481	Alright.
3606941	3609103	I want a McDonald's version of Street Fighter 2.
3609283	3610905	Like, they've already got it in the trailer.
3611325	3612586	Give me Capcom.
3612847	3613187	Come on.
3613467	3615169	Like, this would be the perfect tie-in right here.
3615409	3618032	Like, Street Fighter 2, like, you've sold it so many times.
3618052	3619793	I mean, you could practically give it away.
3620314	3626680	Just do, like, a small, like, six-character demo that has three stages or something like that.
3626920	3628481	Let's just, like, let's play it.
3628521	3628902	Come on.
3629022	3633306	It'd be so easy and such awesome publicity.
3633607	3637091	Quest Buster in chat says, I want a McDonald's version of Street Fighter 2 also.
3637171	3637632	Heck yeah.
3638753	3638953	Heck yeah.
3640034	3640315	All right.
3640335	3640815	And what's this?
3641036	3647122	They also have something that says, in addition, they also have Overflowing Energy McFizz.
3647163	3650626	It's a sparkling apple juice and a McFloat.
3651047	3653470	It says it adds sparkling apple juice.
3653490	3653830	Hold on.
3654531	3658095	Does that mean if there's a float, does that mean the ice cream machines work in Japan?
3658818	3659583	Yeah.
3659603	3660166	Oh my God.
3660750	3662723	Japan is just so far ahead of us in technology.
3662803	3663226	It's wild.
3663467	3663890	I know.
3664031	3665520	We're never going to catch up.
3666547	3670711	Orange right in chat says, just imagine that Smash 64 commercial.
3670771	3672972	There's trouble happening in the world of McDonaldland.
3673193	3675715	Grimace kicks the Hamburglar in the gut.
3676035	3678257	Slaggy McWaggy from Game Buoys in chat.
3678277	3678717	Hey, Slaggy.
3679038	3682480	Saying McDonald's land fighting game, Grimace versus Birdie.
3683541	3686444	I would support that, but only if the hot Hamburglar is in it.
3686464	3691908	It has to be the hot Hamburglar from like 15 years ago when they tried to reboot the Hamburglar and made them hot.
3692449	3695151	If the hot Hamburglar is in the game, then I'm fine with it.
3695171	3696132	Otherwise, keep it.
3697445	3700751	Let's get into the classic game of the week.
3711329	3719102	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3719122	3722187	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3723128	3724029	All right.
3724069	3730278	And the game that I have picked for you this week, since, you know, DarkSakura is not here, so she can't pick the game.
3731019	3732360	I am left to pick the game tonight.
3732440	3735865	So I, this might actually be the last time I get to pick a game.
3735905	3736245	I don't know.
3736306	3742594	But I went back through kind of like the NES archive of like, what are some Nintendo games maybe I haven't talked about yet?
3743275	3750925	And I landed on this one, which I consider to be the sequel to one of the all-time great NES games.
3751867	3754270	It's called Fester's Quest.
3754290	3758075	That's right, Fester's Quest is the game I've picked for the classic game of the week.
3758115	3762260	And it's starting, this video we're showing on Twitch lovingly starts on a game over screen.
3762300	3763261	How appropriate.
3763281	3764423	Anyway, here's the deal.
3764443	3768788	So Fester's Quest, yes, it is a tie-in to The Addams Family, hence the name of the game.
3769589	3773814	It was developed by Sunsoft, who also made Blaster Master.
3773874	3780743	The composer of the music in the game, Naoki Koroaka, also the composer of Blaster Master, is...
3780723	3783851	In this game, you play as Uncle Fester.
3783951	3798006	The plot, the loose plot of the game is that a UFO beams up the residents of the city where the Addams family are, except for the members of the family, and Grandmama is still there, and...
3797986	3802613	I guess she put a protective bubble or something on the home, a protective spell.
3802633	3810845	So Gomez is busy guarding the home from aliens, so Uncle Fester has to use his gun to save the town.
3810865	3812527	That's what it is, okay?
3812928	3818896	And this is so funny to me because, you know, looking back, and I joke about how this game is just a sequel to Blaster Master.
3819357	3825546	When you look at it, it really is just the overhead components of Blaster Master, right down to...
3825526	3850960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3851260	3855407	You go around to different houses and you actually find members of the Addams Family.
3855467	3860756	So you get, you know, you see Thing, the Little Hand, Wednesday, Grandmama Pugsley, Morticia Gomez.
3861297	3868729	And you can actually summon Lurch to get all of the enemies off the screen by using a noose item.
3868709	3873676	You go through the city with all the houses and you go down into sewers.
3874157	3877142	And that's how you traverse to get around tree obstacles.
3877202	3880226	This game is just one big giant fucking maze.
3880246	3889160	And then when you get into certain parts of the buildings, you get into certain buildings, you actually will fight alien bosses.
3890041	3890562	Huh.
3890582	3893647	What was another game on the NES where we fought alien bosses?
3893807	3893907	Yeah.
3895574	3902786	Anyway, it gives Fester a puzzle piece and a picture of the UFO and then we'll refill the items.
3902946	3906171	Fester leaves the building and you can't go back through it.
3906192	3914044	So once all five bosses are gone, you board the UFO and beat one more boss and the invasion has been prevented.
3914065	3918612	Interesting sort of like bug between the US version and the European version is...
3918592	3947333	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3947313	3953542	But then you go back and IGN ranked it 45th on its top 100 NES games list.
3954604	3957688	Some sites like Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 5 out of 10.
3958209	3960672	Nintendo Life gave it 1 star out of 10.
3961293	3964738	Meanwhile, Nintendo Power gave it 4.45 out of 5.
3964778	3967903	And Video Game gave it 5 stars out of 5.
3967883	3974234	So I think this is just a game where it's going to depend a little bit on your taste in games.
3975056	3978843	And, you know, that's how it goes sometimes.
3979864	3982088	Going to some comments in chat.
3982108	3985474	Slaggy McWaggy says, where did Uncle Fester get a gun?
3985835	3990904	He did – actually, I think that is canon in the comics and –
3991340	3994284	Not the movie, but I want to say the TV show.
3994304	3996568	But the gun wasn't like literal bullets.
3996768	3999031	It was more like a zany thing.
3999472	4003618	YYR in chat says, cheap asset, flip, unity, crap, one star.
4003718	4004579	You know what's funny?
4005220	4008144	You're kind of not off the mark with a comment like that.
4008184	4012090	They very much used assets they already had to make a tie-in game.
4012430	4014674	So why do I pick a game like this?
4014694	4017718	If the game wasn't remembered as being very good, why do I pick it?
4017766	4047773	because it's amazing is why yeah I actually don't think it's as bad as people say it is I think there's a lot of NES games yeah there's a lot of NES games people look back on like and I feel this way about like the Friday the 13th game as well but I understand why people hate that game this game I'm like it's not as bad as people say it is but it's just not for everybody right and I remember this game distinctly because I asked for this game one Christmas I wanted to get this game on Christmas and
4047753	4058877	I remember one day I looked in the shopping bags as a curious kid of what my mom got from the
4058975	4087092	but of course I had to pretend that I didn't see it or else Christmas was going to get cancelled knowing my mother so I had to just make believe but that didn't stop me from fucking with my mother and what I mean by that is when we went to the game rental place to rent games and it was like two days before Christmas I saw Fester's Quest on the shelf and I was like oh I should rent this one I've really been wanting to play this game I did
4088725	4094596	Super Mario Bros.
4094616	4112268	2 and Doki Doki Panic set the buy half or asset flips.
4112288	4113130	That's...
4113110	4116594	That's a very funny point, but that was a very different situation as well.
4116614	4118136	But I get the joke you're making there.
4118156	4118537	It's funny.
4120339	4129831	OrangeRite in chat says, I love that the commercial uses, if you make one mistake, it's back to the beginning again as a selling point.
4129851	4131714	It's pretty accurate.
4132014	4132755	Yep.
4132775	4137201	QuestBuster in chat says, the NES years were like the Wild West of licenses.
4137221	4142948	You never knew what was going to get resurrected next, like giving Uncle Fester his own game just because.
4143080	4156620	I forgot about this part of the game I know, I forgot about those and you're talking about the mazes that look like the old old Phantasy Star 1 mazes or like PC RPG mazes yeah, the flicker is harsh, right, PopCulture?
4156760	4160025	I didn't even realize this game had a strobing effect, sorry um
4161068	4164075	I do still kind of look back fondly on this.
4164355	4166159	I was going to say also the early 90s.
4166380	4172373	So I guess it wasn't quite in 89 yet because this game came out 89, right?
4172393	4175420	Yeah, it came out September of 89 and then in Europe in the 90s.
4175801	4178166	When was that Addams Family movie released?
4178348	4179029	That was around the time.
4179169	4179950	No, it was 91.
4179970	4182652	I want to say the first Addams Family movie was 91.
4183273	4185275	But maybe they knew they were going to do that.
4185295	4188438	So yeah, because I always thought this tied into the movie, but I guess not.
4188458	4191300	It's really more because of like probably the TV show.
4191601	4194483	The TV shows were still in reruns when I was 10, though.
4194543	4197146	I remember they used to show old Addams Family on Channel 58.
4197386	4200189	That's how I got into it.
4200209	4201910	They used to show old Batman.
4201930	4203572	They used to show old... Whoops, not that screen.
4203772	4204913	They used to show old Batman.
4204933	4206735	They used to show old...
4207880	4211665	Adam's Family, and all the old shows.
4211685	4212586	Maybe Dennis the Menace?
4212606	4213567	I don't know.
4213587	4214548	Anyway, there it is.
4214588	4216390	Your Classic Game of the Week.
4217251	4219714	Dennis the Menace had a cartoon show at that time, too.
4219914	4220555	Oh, that's right.
4221456	4224760	So this is one of your NES favorites, too, Loki.
4224800	4226382	What do you remember about this game?
4227183	4232229	Funny enough, I remember seeing this game in Nintendo Power is where I originally first saw it.
4232750	4233791	I don't know.
4234092	4236254	It's fun to play because I like Blaster Master.
4236615	4236975	Yeah.
4238693	4241117	But totally not a sequel to Blaster Master, but it is.
4241137	4245285	It's probably a better sequel than the Genesis game.
4247188	4249532	Did it have the pause glitch thing with this one?
4249552	4251255	I don't know if you had grenades in this game.
4251315	4253940	No, they didn't do grenades.
4253960	4255803	You had the whip instead.
4255824	4256845	You had the gun and you had the whip.
4257547	4259470	So, yeah, no grenades.
4260665	4265115	As Jonah and Matt says, now imagine a Wednesday spinoff with Fred Armisen with this.
4265216	4266438	Ha ha.
4266579	4268483	Well, you know, that Fester's getting his own show.
4268503	4272452	They confirmed that Netflix is going to do a Fred Armisen, Uncle Fester show.
4272673	4274256	So that is Fred Armisen.
4274276	4276682	I mean, why would you give him another show?
4276662	4280827	OrangeRite says, give Fester's Quest the Blaster Master zero treatment.
4280847	4282449	That is a great idea.
4283089	4284191	That is a great idea.
4284791	4288515	They should do that as a tie-in to the upcoming series.
4288636	4297385	I like the idea of giving a game that really shouldn't have a sequel just a really awesome remaster.
4297666	4298387	Like a second chance.
4298427	4299168	I love it.
4299188	4301610	Like a Bubsy 4D.
4301650	4304914	That doesn't need a fourth game, but they...
4305097	4307921	and they're like, we're going to give it 100%, man.
4308642	4312007	They've, for God's sakes, they've re-released Night Trap how many times?
4312027	4313810	That game is not good.
4313830	4315652	That game is not good.
4315672	4332817	It is only remembered for being a FMV, full motion video game that had Dana Plato, who unfortunately lost, you know, well before her time and that it was girls running around scantily clad in a, you know, crossing the line of what might be an adults only type of game at that time.
4332917	4332977	Mm.
4332957	4334539	That's the only reason that game is popular.
4334559	4335279	It's not a good game.
4336300	4337201	Let's be very clear.
4337321	4353597	Well, you know, just along those lines too, and I don't think it made our show roll, but it was the 1995 Cyber Dreams game, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream, or And I Must Scream, got an update recently that they were patching that game even.
4354158	4360044	So that's kind of funny that people are going back and still working on some of these games.
4360224	4360925	That is wild.
4361145	4362306	Well, yeah.
4362286	4366411	Alright, SlaggyMcWaggy in chat says, Rob is going to star in Night Trap 2026.
4366451	4369874	That is his first post-OLR project.
4369994	4371196	No, well, I don't know.
4371216	4374860	Actually, if I was approached to be in a Night Trap sequel, I guess I'd have to do it.
4374940	4376742	Like, nobody's asked me to be in a video game before.
4376782	4378123	I kind of have to do it, right?
4378304	4383649	So... Alright, let's move on.
4383690	4387614	Let's do a couple other headlines real fast in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
4387634	4388715	Loki...
4388847	4392692	Alright, Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting some pretty funny mods.
4392812	4404568	There's one that a YouTuber, streamer Blurbs, created a moral combat mode in Red Dead Redemption 2.
4404729	4415724	So any encounter that you get with, you know, be it people, be it a bear, it actually goes into like a fighting game thing with health bars and stuff like that.
4416044	4418247	And there's even fatalities in it.
4418632	4419613	It's hilarious.
4419893	4423937	I've watched clips of it, and it looks really funny.
4425058	4427661	I haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2 on my PC, though.
4427681	4428382	I should check it out.
4428762	4429523	Yeah, it looks awesome.
4430704	4432926	And then, what else?
4433507	4442075	We got Psycho Shmups are going to be delisted from Steam on October 31st.
4442956	4448622	That includes Gunbird, Gunbird 2, Gunbarch,
4448602	4450124	or Gumbarich, I guess.
4451226	4470533	We have Dragon Blaze, Samurai Aces, Samurai Aces, Episode 2, Tengai, Samurai Aces, Episode 3, Sengoku Kanon, Soul Divide, Strikers 1945, 1945 2, and 1945 3, and Zero Gunner 2 are all going to be delisted and no longer available to purchase on there.
4471114	4473217	I'm pretty sure I have quite a few of these.
4473578	4476482	Maybe I might be thinking of my handheld...
4476462	4480707	I don't know what the reason is behind that.
4481047	4482229	It's a license agreement.
4482529	4483270	Oh, well, of course.
4483631	4483891	Of course.
4485012	4485553	All right.
4485653	4487335	Moving on to music games.
4487735	4490659	I know some of you out there are fans of Spin Rhythm XD.
4490679	4493622	I remember when Alan was streaming and he used to stream this.
4493662	4495304	Spin Rhythm is still going strong.
4496386	4499009	It's sold more than 100,000 units, FYI.
4499029	4505136	And there are seven new tracks coming to the Indie Pack DLC coming out on November 11th.
4505116	4511664	Uh, this, uh, Sai and the Switch, but I'm assuming that's all platforms just because I'm looking at a Nintendo-based news website.
4511684	4516229	Uh, the artists that are going to be in this track, uh, this pack, I must admit, I do not know them.
4516249	4526181	Blanco Tronco, Hai, Hachiku, Mai, Mei, Semanus, I don't know, sorry, if I'm, I'm probably horribly butchering these names, my apologies.
4526602	4529385	They kind of sound like maybe...
4529365	4529806	I don't know.
4529866	4532389	Maybe they're Vocaloid type of bands, but I don't know.
4532449	4533210	I really don't.
4533230	4534972	But they're indies, so of course I'm not going to know.
4534992	4535633	And that's not shady.
4535713	4537995	I just don't know them because they're indies, but maybe I should.
4538015	4539878	And that's why this pack is coming out.
4540619	4543622	Again, four-player local support in this game.
4543642	4546966	70 songs now that this is up to.
4547026	4553694	The new indie pack will cost $7.99 or $6.99 in euros on November 11th.
4553734	4555937	If you want to get the base game, it is out for $20.
4555977	4558360	Check that out.
4558340	4563962	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can buy this coming week.
4564988	4566590	Alright, we've got quite a few things.
4567031	4572738	Starting off with Fantasy Maiden Wars, Dream of the Stray Dreamers.
4572998	4574380	That is on PC.
4574881	4579346	Jurassic World Evolution 3 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
4579447	4582210	And they got bullied out of the AI in that game, right?
4582731	4583892	Wasn't that a thing?
4583912	4586335	Remember when they showed up the game and it was using AI?
4586756	4587777	I remember that they did that.
4587837	4589740	I don't know if they got bullied out of it.
4589960	4591502	I thought I heard they had.
4591482	4607685	Ninja Gaiden 4 on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series Painkiller on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines 2 on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series
4607665	4620402	Dispatch on PC and PlayStation 5, Angry Video Game Nerd 8-bit on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and even the NES.
4621063	4622665	I guess it's a NES game.
4622685	4624548	Oh, Mega Cat Studios, definitely a NES game.

4720283	4722927	Well, the arcade games are alright.
4723527	4729995	I mean, I feel like it's a little bit reductive of other racing games in the arcade that are probably better, but it's cute.
4730684	4745547	and that is on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 although that game is just Cruisin' I think which is on the Switch so Fast and Furious is just Cruisin' with the Fast and Furious branding?
4745647	4751055	I think so because I remember Cruisin' because we had that

4784553	4792082	YYR, by the way, in chat says the new remaster of Plants vs. Zombies is based on the Windows Phone version and is full of bugs and glitches.
4792102	4794485	Ew, why would you pick the Windows Phone for anything?
4794925	4797428	Don't ever pick the Windows Phone.

4826173	4828236	Actually, no, that's not the one I'm interested in.
4828296	4830179	I want to do the one that's the retro inspired.
4830199	4831581	That already came out.
4831601	4832543	I'm just behind on my games.
4833945	4838672	But that, you know, if you're interested in that, there's a regular edition, deluxe edition, multi-length.
4838732	4839413	It's, you know,
4839393	4842517	Every edition you can think of for that game is coming.

4875891	4876512	I drive truck.
4876632	4877414	That is correct.
4877494	4878415	You drive trucks.
4878516	4879257	Good job, Loki.
4879277	4880419	You win the prize.
4882120	4885667	It honestly looks just like Euro Truck Simulator or one of those type of games.
4886348	4888773	Once Upon a Katamari, of course, also out this week.
4888793	4890777	Exciting, exciting.

5095437	5096919	Busy, busy week to say the least.
5098541	5099002	Yep.
5099022	5099343	All right.
5100264	5103609	We have one more headline for you, and this is actually a really, really sad one.
5104410	5107354	Sorry to end on a downer, but I didn't know where else to talk about this.
5107374	5109718	This is very surprising, actually, Loki.
5111060	5120693	The longtime director of the Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series, Tomonobu Itagaki, has passed away at age 58.
5121134	5123097	That's young.
5123117	5123217	Yeah.
5123855	5131323	Yeah, basically, you know, said that he had, you know, no regrets.
5131764	5138711	But yeah, of course, Team Ninja put out, you know, statements saying, you know, we're deeply saddened by the passing of Team Ninja's first leader.
5138731	5146920	And we'll carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy.
5146940	5149643	Our deepest condolences for his loss.
5149775	5179782	and we have no idea as to the cause because there was a he had posted like a message on Facebook like through a friend or something that made the post it was a very itagaki statement because at the end it just kind of went so it goes you know type of thing it was very very sad um so yeah but obviously young so yeah I'm kind of left to think it might have been dizzy I don't I know speculating is very bad but you kind of want to know like why so early so um but what a huge loss to the industry and especially on the eve of
5179762	5202816	that next yeah that's really unfortunate so um what a loss for the industry and uh very very sad to hear it so Dead or Alive huge contributions of that franchise as well it's it's he's really was a staple of like especially some of those E3s the years that we went like I remember what a legend that guy was so very sad to hear that
5203437	5203778	All right.
5204378	5208866	Well, let's move on to the listener roundtable where you can get your thoughts and opinions in.
5208906	5214314	If you want to send us an email, participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place where you can send us an email.
5214795	5220804	I did check in there before the show tonight and I did not see any emails, but I do want to let you know the show ends next month.
5220824	5225091	So if you've ever been wanting to send us an email, now would be a great time to do it.
5225071	5227634	Um, so, uh, just a heads up on that.
5227654	5229096	I did check social media as well.
5229136	5235645	You can go, um, and you can always send us a post, uh, at our blue sky account, which is at orange launch radio.com.
5235665	5238028	We are verified by domain on blue sky.
5238468	5240812	And I don't think I saw much.
5241112	5246559	I did notice we got a little tag from our buddies at game buoy who are always so kind to shout us out at the end of the show.
5246579	5255010	So shout out right back to our friends at game buoy, uh, for, um, for all that they do over there.
5255176	5257499	and yeah, everything else is from last week.
5257539	5267915	So it's kind of a slow week on social media, but I will say I did catch before the show, I did catch a post that Dark Tetsuya, and since it's on social media, I guess I can say it.
5268455	5275826	Dark Tetsuya's in the ER right now and it sounds manageable because I see he's still putting replies, but still just sending our thoughts.
5276167	5278450	Dark Tetsuya has been here since episode one.
5278430	5293857	Any last minute stories you want to bring up here, Loki?
5294461	5317937	Hi, it's YYR Hi, YYR, how are you?
5318744	5320227	I'm okay.
5320247	5324494	I was a little surprised.
5325276	5335894	I will admit, I had not kept up with OLR in a hot minute.
5336676	5340803	And I then, you know...
5341610	5358859	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5360020	5360581	Oh, wow.
5361482	5362483	I did not expect that.
5362923	5367288	Yeah, surprise.
5368809	5369350	But you know what?
5369370	5378439	It's like I listened to what you were saying about how all the news has been lately and what's going on in the industry.
5378459	5381483	And it's just like, I get it.
5382343	5384125	It's day after day after day.
5384205	5388610	It really seems like we're headed towards...
5388826	5389447	Something.
5390188	5402185	I couldn't tell you what, but clearly we're out of the days of what was, and we're heading towards something different.
5402666	5408274	Yeah, it's weird feeling this lack of joy with a lot of things gaming.
5408294	5411439	I mean, at least Pokemon Legends is somewhat of a bright spot.
5411499	5413922	As much as I have my reservations of that game, I'm enjoying it.
5413942	5414764	I'm having a good time.
5415705	5417888	But it just does seem like there's so much...
5417868	5437260	I feel like all these things were just sort of converging where the universe is saying, girl, it's time.
5438303	5440286	And that's that.
5440306	5440867	That's that.
5440887	5441729	It's as simple as that.
5443431	5445555	But it's so good to hear from you.
5445655	5448059	Honestly, though, the good games are always going to be there.
5448139	5448941	That's right.
5448961	5451865	And it's not just at the top.
5453728	5462623	One thing that I very much enjoy doing and totally didn't have the time to do but did it anyway...
5463093	5485152	DarkSakura
5485705	5500795	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5500775	5517518	and I have to say the future of gaming is gonna be bright I played a lot of really good stuff I had a lot of fun and I can guarantee you that if you you know I'm pretty sure you're not going this year but I
5517498	5542594	whoever is out there if you go to magfest you're gonna get an indie showcase that is full of really great stuff and thank god for indies thank god for indies that do feel like a bright spot amongst so much like negative news we see sometimes so i do i do i would love to do like one more magfest at some point but um it's it's rough now that we're doing that cruise it's really hard to do those things back to back that's the only thing it's kind of a bummer yeah
5543806	5545329	Yeah, I totally get that.
5545470	5551142	And I get the work thing too, because we did a phone system transition recently.
5551162	5557717	And I think the last three weeks I've worked between six and seven days worth of hours.
5559220	5560583	It's exhausting.
5560563	5561344	It happens.
5561364	5572600	I just have to point out, by the way, I know our podcasties can't see this, but on Discord, where you're calling us in from tonight, you have all these artwork behind you, and it looks like it's things that your daughter made, I'm going to assume.
5572941	5575004	It's pretty much all that, yes.
5575024	5575485	That's incredible.
5575505	5576066	I love that.
5576186	5576887	I love that.
5576987	5577528	I really do.
5577648	5580352	That's a great use of the wall real estate.
5581493	5586360	Yeah, she's always creating something, which is really cool.
5586421	5587322	How old is she now?
5588063	5588123	Oh.
5588103	5590267	She is now 7.
5590548	5591931	Oh my god, we're old.
5592231	5593193	Oh my god.
5596820	5598323	I was expecting you to say like 4.
5598584	5600347	I literally thought it was like recently.
5600367	5602552	But then I'm like, no, it was before COVID.
5602652	5603153	God.
5603173	5605858	Alright, alright.
5606800	5609706	It's pretty nuts.
5609973	5613941	Thank you again for always shouting out to me on the show.
5614181	5620373	Even in that episode, I just listened to like, oh, that Unity thing.
5620554	5624742	Oh, I wonder if YYR has to update all this stuff.
5625768	5630902	And thank you for thinking of me, although none of my games actually run on Unity, so I didn't have to do anything.
5630922	5631143	Oh, good.
5631263	5631524	Oh, good.
5631544	5632487	No, no, that's a good fun note.
5632507	5633048	That's a good fun note.
5633389	5640790	Well, look, you know, just in case we don't get to talk to you again before this is all over, I just want to say you have been such fun.
5640770	5665950	to have around in this community and obviously one of the big things you did for us was you made wishes come true we had our list of you know games that we thought would be silly and you know you started you started granting wishes right you made bungee ferret tossing a reality and um you know obviously the and the games that you're making on your own without without all our influence you know again i i don't understand why super multitasking is not the indie darling
5665930	5681188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5681590	5700223	I think really what it is is there's just so much good stuff on Steam.
5700203	5705173	I mean, releasing a game is kind of like buying a lotto ticket.
5706316	5712067	There is a very, very small chance that you hit the jackpot.
5712709	5718280	There's somewhat of a chance that you get something small.
5719205	5721869	and everybody else gets nothing.
5721889	5723852	So it's kind of like that.
5724272	5729600	Even if your game is good, just because there's so many choices.
5731283	5733907	But if you just keep releasing, keep trying.
5734848	5737652	I, over the years...
5737885	5744682	Obviously, I haven't hit the jackpot, but I've built up something of a small following.
5744702	5751238	And I've had this one dude emailing me like every few years.
5752220	5754325	Hey, is Snake coming back yet?
5755773	5757376	And you know what?
5757776	5773984	When I put on Steam that it's coming soon, and there is now a page listed for Snake Party Extreme, which is the name I'm going with for basically what is the culmination of all of Snake 360's features and updates.
5773964	5782634	There was actually a little-known 2016 release, one of the last Xbox Live indie games, Snake Party.
5782654	5791524	So it has basically Snake 360, Snake Party, and then a few things from the cutting room floor that I'm putting back in because why the hell not?
5791544	5793566	And because I don't know when to stop.
5794307	5796990	And that's going to be Snake Party Extreme.
5798632	5802797	If you've been managing these big projects at work, you ought to know about Scope Creep, Aaron.
5802857	5803077	Yeah.
5804170	5805972	Oh, I'm not making anything else for this.
5806012	5813822	I'm working on right now the keyboard support and the other things that people buying a PC game expect to be there.
5814683	5819129	And of course, achievements and leaderboards and the features that are going to be unique to Steam.
5820370	5823134	But other than that, nothing else is going in there.
5823815	5826758	It's a very done project.
5827800	5829982	But I'm probably pushing it back to February.
5830002	5832085	But other than that, yeah, it's coming.
5832318	5834423	By the way, you said something there like two or three minutes ago.
5834464	5844309	I really just want to kind of revisit because it felt very like I felt that when you said that you don't always hit the jackpot and you didn't hit the jackpot, but you got a really small loyal following that cares.
5844329	5848099	I'm like, oh, hashtag relatable content just in a different medium.
5848079	5876803	so yeah yeah no maybe we didn't hit the jackpot of fame but we definitely hit the jackpot of like really just like a really like coolest like a chill as fuck crowd everybody be chill like that's that's what we lucked out with here at Sunday we don't have a lot of drama llamas we don't you know it's it's been very very nice so uh very very lucky in that regard so you know and it's been great it's it's been great to have to have your voices here for for all these years and
5876783	5880909	You know, to just be able to check back in.
5881189	5884374	And as a reminder to everyone, we're not dying.
5884594	5888840	We're not all going on a boat that's going out to sea and then somebody set the boat on fire.
5888900	5890923	That's not what's happening to us.
5890943	5893026	We will still be around to do our things.
5893086	5896592	And I do hope we get to support future releases.
5896992	5904563	It's just going to look a little different, you know, just in whatever maybe I'm doing in the future, whatever Loki decides to do, maybe beyond Minecraft even in the future.
5904543	5911996	and, you know, Jamie's whatever her show looks like in the future that hopefully, you know, and some of you in chat have been talking about, I don't know what I'm going to do on Sunday night.
5912096	5914360	You know, well, we hope you'll continue to support Bobby.
5914380	5915342	He's still going to be here.
5915362	5922073	And then, you know, Jamie is looking at potentially, she doesn't know what day yet, but maybe a Sunday thing as a successor.
5922153	5922855	Maybe not right away.
5922895	5925960	It won't be like maybe the week after, but maybe come 2026.
5925940	5927282	I don't know all the details yet.
5927302	5928503	That's in Jamie's hands.
5929144	5947787	But I know a big part of them being at TwitchCon this weekend is networking, chatting, talking, inspiration, figuring out what that looks like, which is why we wanted to tell you all before TwitchCon so that way Jamie had the freedom to just tell anybody there without like, oh, I got a secret, I got a, you know, type of thing.
5947807	5949028	So...
5949008	5952258	And you know, I've also been dabbling in streaming as well.
5953723	5956010	Yeah, your birthday marathons for Max 300.
5956090	5956993	That's a stream.
5957564	5962490	That is a stream, but more regularly, I've been playing most frequently.
5962511	5964133	Aaron, you know what I could do on Sunday nights?
5964153	5966916	I could go play DDR now on Sunday night.
5967737	5969219	That's something I could do in my free time.
5969239	5969900	You should!
5970281	5971522	You should!
5971723	5974286	The latest version has like a bajillion songs.
5974366	5975628	I know, I know.
5977050	5982677	We live, round one in Roseville got one of the new MyMys, which is all the rage, yeah.
5982657	5989185	I... There's one in the city, but like the last time I went, the line was forever long.
5989205	5994372	Finally, finally it took... I hope they freaking appear everywhere.
5994392	5996495	Finally, finally in Sacramento.
5996815	6001301	It only took 23 and a half years of this program, but finally the good music games are here.
6001441	6003023	We don't have to fucking go to LA to play.
6003383	6005446	It only took us quitting to make that happen.
6005546	6009731	So congratulations to the people of Sacramento and Roseville.
6010893	6010993	Yeah.
6012847	6018335	I've been playing Legend of Zelda on Saturday nights.
6018375	6021259	I've actually been playing it for a couple of years now.
6021279	6029130	And I've, again, built up a small but devoted following watching me play ROM hacks that are increasingly difficult.
6029210	6030872	There's this one dude making them.
6030892	6032695	He goes by ZeldaMaker.
6032675	6061298	and the one I'm playing now is just absolutely balls to the wall difficult not only in terms of the combat but also like what the heck do I do now so I'm like a few hours into it and I'm just like oh boy so and then I've been streaming just random stuff on Wednesdays but I was actually toying with the idea like
6062341	6075608	I wonder if I could do some sort of hour-long show where I either discuss news or take calls while also trying to play a game.
6075740	6082612	And the idea is, you know, try to rile up the host so that he screws up his game kind of thing.
6082872	6084134	Like, can you do that?
6084735	6088361	I mean, it all takes an idea and a commitment.
6088462	6091266	So like physically, are you capable of doing that?
6091347	6093370	And like smarts wise, are you capable of doing that?
6093390	6093771	Absolutely.
6093791	6094692	There's nothing stopping you.
6094792	6095293	You can do it.
6095694	6098539	But now the question is, is it worth it?
6098699	6100482	Is it the commitment you want to make?
6100462	6103650	And that's kind of that second question to answer.
6103810	6111490	But, you know, if that's what you decide you want to do, which, you know, sounds like a kind of a fun concept, you know, I would ask, how is that going to vary week to week?
6111510	6113214	I guess it would be the game that you're playing or whatever.
6113234	6116001	But would the derailment concept get old week after week?
6116302	6117846	But I think that would be...
6117826	6118968	I do hope you explore.
6119028	6121573	Of course, I want to empower people to create content.
6121593	6128765	Folks out there have been very kind, especially in these closing hours of saying that OLR inspired me to do my own podcast.
6129006	6140606	That's very humbling and really the best possible compliment I think we can get is that like showing that, hey, if we can do it, you can do it and people do it is amazing.
6140627	6141488	It's a huge compliment.
6143476	6145699	Alright, that's something to think about then.
6145719	6154111	Well, I wish you the best in whatever's next for you, and if, you know, whatever it is, I look forward to supporting you from a different medium, from a different boat.
6155373	6157516	I could say exactly the same thing right back to you.
6157776	6159439	I appreciate that.
6159619	6168431	All the best, and maybe we'll talk to you again before it's all over, but just in case, hey to the family, and I better not blink, and that kid is driving.
6168592	6170935	I better not blink, and that kid is driving.
6171455	6173238	Depends on how much you blink.
6173258	6174700	A lot.
6175802	6176082	All right.
6176162	6176863	Take care, Aaron.
6177084	6177484	Have a good one.
6178226	6178786	Hey, you too.
6178867	6179468	Have a great week.
6179688	6179868	Yep.
6179928	6180249	Bye-bye.
6181230	6182392	Bye.
6182412	6182853	All right.
6183854	6186819	This is going to be fun and also difficult these last few weeks.
6186839	6190144	All these voices from memory lane are going to be coming back, but it's a good thing.
6190345	6191286	It's a good thing.
6191772	6193334	Last Minute Stories.
6193355	6194356	Did I already check in on that?
6194376	6195398	Do you have anything, Loki?
6195418	6196339	Yeah, we don't have anything.
6196419	6197080	Okay, then.
6197621	6198062	That's it.
6198122	6199224	We're going to wrap it up here.
6199344	6205454	So I used to have this big spiel, I would say, at the end about trying to draw new listeners to the show and spread the word and all that.
6205854	6212565	Seems a little weird at this point as the sun is going down, but I do want to use this point of the show to remind everybody.
6212545	6214910	Our final show is going to be November 23rd.
6214970	6217014	We're looking for 23 November, if you will.
6217034	6218917	There's a joke there that I'm sure most of you will get.
6218937	6221743	It's as close to the other numbers as we could get, 23 November.
6222464	6226873	And we hope you'll be able to join us for that live or podcast.
6226893	6230500	And just a moment to thank everybody for their support over the last 23 and a half years.
6230600	6234908	As came up in that call with YYR right there, maybe it's not –
6234888	6262785	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6262765	6265768	Number two, that Cats Jellicle Ball.
6266049	6266749	Have you seen this?
6267070	6268391	The ads for the Cats Jellicle Ball?
6268772	6273357	Oh, they're doing like the Paris is Burning 90s voguing culture ballroom thing.
6273677	6275759	And they're doing it with cats.
6275779	6278702	And as much as it's like, isn't cats kind of played out at this point?
6278722	6281185	It's like, oh, fuck, that's a really good pairing.
6281205	6285690	So I actually really want to see that when it goes to Broadway because it's played off Broadway for a little bit.
6285710	6286831	And some of the clips was really good.
6286911	6292097	So I think I will have to do a trip to New York like sooner rather than later, to be quite honest.
6294288	6295690	All right.
6295710	6300296	We will not be here next week just due to day job and paycheck commitments.
6301318	6303220	I don't know if DarkSakura is streaming next week.
6303300	6305403	My assumption is she will be.
6305603	6307126	Bobby will absolutely be here.
6307226	6312072	So we hope those of you at the Voice Geeks Network will still be here at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern to support Bobby.
6312733	6315537	Loki, are you doing anything next Sunday with a week off?
6315854	6326592	I am not, but the Sunday after that, I am going to be in a Minecraft competition event that's a charity fundraiser for cancer research.
6327373	6333643	So that'll be Sunday morning, I think at 11 Pacific.
6334433	6335374	I don't remember exactly.
6335675	6336516	It'll be on my socials.
6336616	6339480	You are so smart using this time to do all these guest appearances.
6339861	6345289	I know it's very exhausting, but I really hope that helps people get to know who you are.
6345309	6349635	So it's like I was telling some of my other cast members and stuff.
6349995	6356545	Yeah, it's nice to get your foot in the door with some of this stuff, but like I don't necessarily enjoy these events.
6356986	6359008	Not to say like I don't want to sound elitist or anything.
6359069	6360070	It's just like
6360455	6368153	The whole point with trying to get in with certain groups is to be able to network with larger creators.
6368173	6369436	I'm not doing that here.
6369456	6370980	These are not larger creators.
6371220	6376152	And while it's good to get to know some of these people, it's just not going to...
6376132	6401785	help me open any doors small plus small might be still small but it's still it's larger than it was before and I think a really good comparison is probably like I think I look back at the history of this show and I think about when we came to all games radio you know we had an established community for years they had an established community for years neither one of them were huge you know uh but when we came together we there were a lot of people that found you
6401765	6404910	something else kind of through that and, you know, it really works.
6404930	6409997	So sometimes it's just finding like that right partnership and that right match for the community ends up being a great thing.
6410258	6417789	And it's more of like, you know, it's these type of events aren't necessarily, it's like different types of events that these guys put on.
6418650	6419672	This isn't
6419652	6425498	This is more of like an MCC thing where it's just like you're playing through games and it's mostly like PvP and parkour and stuff like that.
6425878	6428221	There are some that are a little bit different than that.
6428341	6432925	Like I know Legundo does this thing where it's like, I don't know if it's like flowers.
6432945	6439232	It's something with flowers where you're getting flowers and it's also PvP at the same time.
6439252	6439972	But there's that.
6440052	6444597	There's another like Christmas event that Wadebox and...
6444577	6472660	I think maybe an Orbitz that put on a while back as well where it's a lot of like oh you have all these challenges but they're like group challenges and you're all together you're not like doing PVP or anything it's more of just like hanging out in a group and there's a lot more like talking to people and getting to know them and like getting to like you know play with other creators like that's the type of like thing I'm looking to do whereas you know not to say that the last few things I've done haven't been
6472640	6501398	it's good to get my foot in the door but the last one was playing Peak which is fine, Peak's fine but it's not Minecraft, I don't really want to, playing Blood on the Clock Tower which is fine, I don't really get the game and also once again not Minecraft and then other events where I'm participating in them but I can't make content from them because it's not interesting for content why am I making content for other people is what I'm trying to say I get that
6502255	6503157	It's fine.
6503317	6508246	It'll hopefully get me better opportunities in the future.
6509609	6513957	These aren't quite the circles I'm looking to get into yet, but hopefully it'll be a subbing soon.
6514578	6516321	Alright.
6516802	6520289	Well, with that, I need to get your actual final thought tonight, Loki.
6520309	6521631	Do you have any final thoughts for us?
6521965	6523326	I'm going to play Konamari this week.
6523606	6524207	There you go.
6524607	6524968	Awesome.
6525808	6528271	And my final thought is I'm going to play more Pokemon Legends.
6528611	6534136	And I would just say I had the absolute honor of hosting a show last night here in Sacramento with some drag monsters.
6534556	6542303	So we had the Boulay brothers from their show Dragula and some of their monsters, Abora, Asia Consent, and who am I missing?
6542323	6542704	Vandervan.
6542764	6543104	Oh, my God.
6543124	6544105	How did I forget Vandervan?
6544846	6545987	We're all incredible.
6546187	6548469	And the local, it was just such an incredible show to be a part of.
6548809	6549770	I was just so happy for that.
6549830	6551972	And it really made me think, happy Halloween.
6551952	6555996	It was such a creepy show in the best possible way.
6556016	6558298	And it's just a scene I've loved being a part of.
6558318	6561701	And I am doing some more shows here locally in the Sacramento area.
6561721	6563442	We have a great one coming up this Friday.
6564383	6565044	So check it out.
6565064	6566225	Rocky Horror is sold out, though.
6566505	6570289	So if you don't have a ticket to that, it's the 50th anniversary.
6571309	6573672	But go see it in your town with a cast.
6573692	6576094	Don't go see it at the fucking Multiplex.
6576114	6577475	That's not the same thing.
6577555	6581959	Go see it with a cast in the worst part of your town.
6581939	6583541	Go see it.
6583561	6584522	That's the way to do it.
6584542	6585523	All right.
6585644	6586204	But we'll be back.
6586244	6587626	No, we won't be back next week.
6587666	6589488	I guess this is my chance to say happy Halloween.
6590069	6590630	Happy Halloween.
6590690	6591831	I hope everybody has a great Halloween.
6592012	6592432	Be safe.
6592833	6593834	Be fun.
6593854	6596197	And don't be mean to each other.
6596497	6600883	We'll see you in two weeks back here with the final run of episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
6600943	6602084	Have a great week, everybody.
6602104	6604447	Good night.
6604467	6606850	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6608838	6636229	See you next week.
