1
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had taken that economics class in high school, I might be able to understand how to compare sales like a single game in contrast to subscription services like Game Pass.

2
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:27,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft reportedly lost $300 million in sales putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass Day 1, which, duh, anyone that wants to be in the Microsoft ecosystem and has already subscribed to Game Pass gets to play it at no additional cost.

3
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:29,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shrugging furiously right now.

4
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:35,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about Microsoft's headlines and the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:37,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting right now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice...

6
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:45,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:53,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Orange Lounge Radio Live, again, again, again, episode number 1064 for tonight, October the 5th of 2025.

8
00:00:54,388 --> 00:01:00,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to talk about video game news, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and once in a while, a really good new recipe.

9
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:05,078
[SPEAKER_05]: With myself, Rob Roberts, and your co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:08,682
[SPEAKER_01]: The only recipes I hear of is a recipe for disaster.

11
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:37,352
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:38,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Mega Bonk.

13
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Bonk.

14
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to do with Bonk from the TurboGrafx era.

15
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,741
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing to do with that.

16
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:47,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a funny story about this.

17
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:55,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a guy who I watch on YouTube named Danny, who is a game developer in Unity.

18
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,642
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one game that he was trying to push for a while called Carlson.

19
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:02,969
[SPEAKER_04]: He also made some free-to-play games.

20
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:06,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Crab Game was one that was really popular for a while.

21
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:07,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a Squid Game type thing.

22
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:12,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's disappeared off the face of the earth for the longest time.

23
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:20,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Ironically, this game comes out and, you know, it does really well and it's sort of similar to his style.

24
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And wouldn't you know it, the developer's name is his name backwards.

25
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:27,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm guessing it's the same person.

26
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,159
[SPEAKER_05]: because that would be quite the coincidence.

27
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:31,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

28
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:32,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

29
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:33,223
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

30
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:35,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you played this game or are you just hearing the hype about it?

31
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:39,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I have purchased this game and have not played this game yet.

32
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Steam backlog issue.

33
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:41,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

34
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm familiar with that one.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

36
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:44,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an issue.

37
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a feature.

38
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:51,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chat because we do tape live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 p.m.

39
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show on Sunday nights.

40
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can listen along live with us.

41
00:02:57,435 --> 00:03:04,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dark Tetsuya, in reference to what I was talking about with Bonk, suggesting another IP Konami's just sitting on.

42
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:13,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I mean, I do feel like I haven't played it myself yet, but just judging from other people, it seems like Silent Hill F is a win.

43
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a win in Konami's column.

44
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,657
[SPEAKER_05]: in a series of what's been honestly good.

45
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:22,965
[SPEAKER_05]: You said it was really good?

46
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:33,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching people play it and I won't be able to until it's on GeForce Experience or if I know it works with Crossover, but from what I've seen, it's

47
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:57,685
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

48
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:22,778
[SPEAKER_05]: well done uh the Castlevania repackages the Metal Gear thing is probably going to be really good too Suikoden coming back and the HD collection is really good um on the arcade front you know round one is is the place to be and a lot of that is because of you know granted not just Konami music games but if but a a series that Konami definitely pioneered and is still a major player in you know so uh

49
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta give credit to Konami.

50
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a Konami Renaissance era, and it's great.

51
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, kudos to them.

52
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to see what's next, especially with, you know, Metal Gear and so forth.

53
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, QuestBuster and Chad agree, it's a huge win for Konami.

54
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:48,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The few horror streamers I managed to catch have loved Silent Hill F. And yeah, I feel like, you know, as much as we're joking about, gosh, it's frustrating that they won't release a new bonk, well, maybe the good news is, if they ever do a new bonk,

55
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a better chance of being good than not so good.

56
00:04:51,537 --> 00:05:02,495
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that be and the powers that be at Konami that are making the decisions now in the 2020s seem to be in a lot better sound place than 10 years ago, 20 years ago even.

57
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good news.

58
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Good news for Konami.

59
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to pick up Silent Hill F at some point.

60
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:08,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably will.

61
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I just picked up a couple other games first.

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in that part of the year where you have to pick and choose what games you play.

63
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just like you have to pick and choose what games you play, you have to pick and choose what consoles you play them on.

64
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:30,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, uh, gonna start us off with a headline, a series of headlines, really, that has the entire gaming industry talking this week.

65
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:31,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, take it away, please.

66
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:40,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, yes, uh, because, you know, Microsoft clearly reading the room of the economy and how everything's kinda...

67
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:41,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the shitter.

68
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:45,701
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, hey, you know what would be a good thing to do about this time?

69
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's raise some more prices.

70
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,864
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they did that.

71
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:52,868
[SPEAKER_04]: They raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50%.

72
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So it went from $20 a month to $30.

73
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, don't worry.

74
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:09,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get some extra features that you may or may not want, including some Ubisoft back catalog games and Fortnite Game Passes or something.

75
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, I guess.

76
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so they did all that.

77
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:19,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They also added streaming, though, to some of the lower tiers as well.

78
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:24,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But for most people, it's like, nope, sorry.

79
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:26,626
[SPEAKER_04]: $360 a year for Game Pass?

80
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:27,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.

81
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was one of those people.

82
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really play Game Pass enough as is.

83
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:40,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of just let it go month to month, and maybe my son will play stuff off of it.

84
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:44,328
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, $30 a month is not something I can just let idly sit there.

85
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with all of their games right now.

86
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:52,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly, I would be picking those up on PC if I'm going to play anything.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:00,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, really the only thing I'm holding onto on my Xbox Series X right now is Grand Theft Auto 6.

88
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Only because it's not on PC at launch.

89
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:06,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, if it was on PC at launch, I'd get it on PC.

90
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,562
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

91
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's just, it's really annoying that they're doing that.

92
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention that on top of all that, they kind of made these assertions back, you know, when this whole, you know, the FTC was looking into them stuff and, you know, we were like, all those, that FTC, what are they doing and stuff, you know, but like...

93
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:46,408
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

94
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:57,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, Call of Duty Points, which were for cosmetics in the Call of Duty series, they are now no longer getting that discount that you used to have.

95
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:02,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're changing the way that discounts work on other...

96
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Passes Game Passes

97
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty Black Ops 6

98
00:08:49,788 --> 00:09:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that lost revenue which I mean like let's hold the phone here for a second so yeah it's lost revenue in the sense that you didn't sell your $80 game or whatever but at the same time you're really whoring those Microsoft points and the Call of Duty points and whatever other points I would also how many of those downloads were people that were actually going to buy the game

99
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

100
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:22,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

101
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that there's some of that stuff.

102
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:30,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you may have lost on some of the sales, but

103
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:36,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really a loss in the end if you're making that stuff up in the microtransactions and all that type of stuff?

104
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that's a fair comparison, but whatever.

105
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then along with this, being this backlash is so big and the fact that these consoles are getting so expensive.

106
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:51,697
[SPEAKER_04]: and that retailers are stopping.

107
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Some retailers are not carrying the Xbox consoles anymore.

108
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:04,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, next-gen Xbox plans might be up in the air if more retailers are not selling the consoles.

109
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:15,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might be something for Microsoft to think about that they may just transition into a third-party game publisher instead and not put out their own consoles.

110
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe they do put their consoles out and...

111
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:42,533
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

112
00:10:42,513 --> 00:10:42,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

113
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:49,302
[SPEAKER_05]: To backtrack a little bit over the large amount of news you just dropped there, you know, about the price going up to $30.

114
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:55,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this just shows a poor lack of planning on Microsoft's part.

115
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite frankly what it is.

116
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:04,681
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from a consumer perspective, the choice to give away games on Game Pass day one, from a consumer perspective, was great.

117
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure really drove a lot of signups for Game Pass.

118
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: But from a business perspective,

119
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:30,964
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

120
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:44,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly believe that if there had been a little more foresight and a little better planning in this regard, now granted, Microsoft could never have foresaw this tariff, well, they maybe could have a little bit, but I'm going to give them a pass, okay?

121
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:52,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, none of us were prepared for the speed and, you know, at which all this bullshit's taking place right now.

122
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth.

123
00:11:54,683 --> 00:12:06,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even considering any of that other stuff and what I'm saying, but the increased price of the consoles does play into the whole the truth is in the perception.

124
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:08,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that

125
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:34,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, I,

126
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,004
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, otherwise, they couldn't have the foresight for that.

127
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:40,389
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Game Pass thing, I feel like they could have had the foresight for.

128
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:49,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they really should have done, and y'all are going to hate me for saying this, but this would have been a better way to get the Band-Aid off than what they're doing now.

129
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:56,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I know most of you would prefer that the Band-Aid just get ripped right off, but in most cases, it isn't always the best business plan.

130
00:12:56,373 --> 00:13:01,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, what we're hearing about the cancellations shutting down the website, it's so many of them.

131
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like what happened with Disney Plus over a completely different situation.

132
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:16,106
[SPEAKER_05]: What Microsoft could have done was six months ago announce, this was an experimental plan for us to deliver the day one games on Game Pass.

133
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to be scaling that back from the service this holiday.

134
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:39,045
[SPEAKER_05]: instead, please look forward to these other types of incentives, blah, blah, blah, blah or maybe try to sweeten the pot at that point with the Fortnite Battle Pass or what I think ought to be a WoW subscription, but I'm a niche gamer, fine, but maybe Blizzard Credit of other sort, you know, Blizzard Bucks or whatever they want to do, you know, sweeten the pot that way, and then

135
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:48,118
[SPEAKER_05]: 6 months later say, now we're coming out with a brand new tier of Game Pass that's Game Pass Ultra Femininominon.

136
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:55,269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Game Pass Femininominon tier that comes out with all the extra stuff in it and the day one and stuff.

137
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that you can get for this hot new deal right now.

138
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:07,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like what we're seeing now is more reactionary to what was bad business planning than what could have been a better business strategy from the beginning.

139
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:30,683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

140
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:57,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt that there was a lot of good stuff that a couple years ago Phil Spencer was doing ever since this Microsoft acquisition I feel like it's been botched decision after botched decision I don't see how he stays at the top of the company much longer especially after if these Game Pass subscriptions keep falling the way they are I'm sorry as a person to say that I don't take delight in it but at the same time

141
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:04,517
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

142
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:10,701
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bad business on Microsoft.

143
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:11,743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

144
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:14,246
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put excuses.

145
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:17,471
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put justifications, I guess, if you're still in Microsoft.

146
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:21,777
[SPEAKER_05]: You can say, well, they have to squeeze every last drop of juice out of their existing consumer.

147
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:27,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I can sit here and say, no matter what way you slice it, it's bad business.

148
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft is not in a position in the gaming space to be able to get away with making many more bad decisions, if any at all.

149
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that.

150
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this decision is going to harm Microsoft.

151
00:15:39,684 --> 00:16:02,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this, coupled with the tariff thing, is ironically going to send a somewhat more American-based company out of the gaming space and make way for its competitors in a foreign country, which is the exact opposite of what our Fuhrer-in-Chief thought he was going to be doing with these tariffs.

152
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,571
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean, think?

153
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:11,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Which part?

154
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there's a functional brain left.

155
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:14,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no.

156
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,584
[SPEAKER_05]: There's clearly not.

157
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:16,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially now.

158
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:21,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, did you see that bro-level military address?

159
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I have mercifully been gone all weekend, and the only thing I listened to, because I drove to L.A.

160
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:32,841
[SPEAKER_05]: and back by myself, and the only thing I had to pass the time was, oh...

161
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's audiobooks available.

162
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:41,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a certain new audiobook from a person I wish would be the president right now that is out.

163
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to listen to this for the next nine hours.

164
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pleasant.

165
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, it was embarrassing.

166
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, E3VL says it right.

167
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:51,938
[SPEAKER_01]: No one clapped at the end.

168
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dead silence.

169
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody hated that.

170
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: No cheering from the press box.

171
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody disliked that.

172
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody disliked that.

173
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:00,246
Yeah.

174
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: There was literally nothing.

175
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

176
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:07,510
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dead silent.

177
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, and you can say, keep politics out of gaming.

178
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your politics out of my gaming show.

179
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:19,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your politics out of... It hasn't stopped politics from getting into our gaming.

180
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:20,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

181
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:21,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the winner.

182
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a prize.

183
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:22,825
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

184
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:23,566
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

185
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:26,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft is...

186
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:38,648
[SPEAKER_05]: As reported by industry media, Microsoft is about to be pushed out of the retail space.

187
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do we have to thank for that?

188
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:47,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad business decisions and decisions where their hand was forced out of their control.

189
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:49,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to back.

190
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,889
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

191
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:53,892
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't keep politics out of gaming.

192
00:17:55,154 --> 00:18:02,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to some of you that it took this long to figure that out.

193
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:03,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

194
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:04,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did I miss?

195
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, anything you want to add?

196
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:15,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just... I feel sick to my stomach.

197
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:18,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the whole thing.

198
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:19,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel sick to my stomach.

199
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,153
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has been...

200
00:18:23,723 --> 00:18:32,142
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has been just really... I can't even... I don't even know what the even that I can't do is.

201
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:34,447
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that bad.

202
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,509
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank God I have a Mac.

203
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I understand that perspective, but also, like, you know, there's...

204
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:49,905
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Microsoft stuff is going to take a while to show up there too You don't bother with Game Pass on Mac, right?

205
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:58,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no Do I really want to play games at the lowest quality possible on my Mac Studio?

206
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:09,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I can run all this stuff by enabling some of my extra metal capabilities Running it through Crossover and have it look freaking perfect Or play it through GeForce

207
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:18,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, oh, and I guess I never said where I'm at personally with my own thing because I've been an Xbox gold or whatever the fuck they've called it over the years.

208
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been at that level of Xbox.

209
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have a 20-year badge, 19-year, 20-year badge.

210
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:25,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a 20-year badge, I'm pretty sure, on my account.

211
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:32,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I got into Xbox in part because of this show and in part to a wedding I went to where they played Halo.

212
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved Halo so much I bought an Xbox.

213
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:38,179
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got on Xbox Live because I wanted the DLC for DDR Ultramix.

214
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,424
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what got me into Xbox and Xbox Live.

215
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:43,490
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have carried it consistently this entire time.

216
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,577
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is now where I'm sitting going, is this the end?

217
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this might be the end.

218
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And to credit to what Bobby was saying earlier in chat, it was a while ago in chat, but Bobby had suggested for Loki just get Essential when Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out if you want to play it online.

219
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, exactly.

220
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a part of me that's like, do I downgrade?

221
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:10,326
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also kind of at this point where I'm like, honestly, maybe I'll just buy Forza Horizon on PlayStation.

222
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think maybe I'm just going to cut Microsoft loose so I'm only paying one of these fees because I'm doing most of my gaming on PC these days.

223
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:33,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I play a little bit on the Switch and I play a little bit on PlayStation and I know we have our Xbox fans in the house and I hope you hear me when I say I'm not being an Xbox hater but I feel like Microsoft's forcing me to make a choice.

224
00:20:34,606 --> 00:20:37,510
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm kind of at this... To you in particular.

225
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:41,896
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, we know that Rob guy is playing all of our stuff.

226
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:46,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna... We're doing all this because of Rob, really.

227
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it's fair.

228
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:53,672
[SPEAKER_05]: No one could have predicted shooting yourself in the foot this hard, though, to be fair.

229
00:20:55,294 --> 00:21:03,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... Well... I guess you could say the government did in the whole thing, but...

230
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:33,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a whole other argument there about what needed to be eliminated from the gaming industry the saddest part of that whole thing was that Bobby Kotek got a golden parachute getting separated from and that's the most fucked up thing about capitalism in America that these executives walk away with millions and you walk away with bigger bills there's gonna come a time where people are finally gonna figure it out

231
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,692
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're not going to take it anymore.

232
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:43,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, I was actually telling Dan that just earlier today in general about stuff and then we started going, can you hear the people sing?

233
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:53,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, we have to rely, there will come a time, there will come a time when people think for themselves instead of reading it online.

234
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Grok told me this.

235
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:00,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember when we went to see Greg Proops?

236
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that was a fun show.

237
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great guy.

238
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what my question to him was?

239
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:07,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not after all these years, but I'm sure you do.

240
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:18,008
[SPEAKER_01]: How far away are we from an American cover of the French Revolution?

241
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:19,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, oh, it's going to happen.

242
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:22,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he signed my paper and said it was cool.

243
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,032
[SPEAKER_05]: You should find that episode.

244
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:24,934
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me his note sheet.

245
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it as framed.

246
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:28,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, well, I'm sure the episode you have somewhere.

247
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the episode.

248
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:31,587
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to find it.

249
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he still podcasts.

250
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,975
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a pretty successful show for a long time.

251
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:44,952
[SPEAKER_05]: If Greg still podcasts, you should email him and say, hey, I just wanted to revisit this question.

252
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:49,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just circling back per my last email.

253
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to see if the Smartest Man in the World podcast is still going.

254
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:54,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

255
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:55,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

256
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:58,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much about baseball from him.

257
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:01,733
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

258
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

259
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about happy things like your gaming week.

260
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:07,080
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

261
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

262
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:14,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I played, uh, of course, Dead by Daylight.

263
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh yeah, the last episode was in 2010.

264
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found out.

265
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that's a bummer.

266
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:20,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

267
00:23:21,816 --> 00:23:24,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, I, uh...

268
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight.

269
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,703
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to do the DBD Day challenges to get all the goodies and whatnot.

270
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:42,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shay and I were playing Survivor and we met two people who were really lovely and were trying to adapt their jills.

271
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were doing Adepts together.

272
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:52,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So we helped them get their Jill Adept, and then we played with them until we got them their Leon, Chris, Carlos Adept.

273
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:55,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Shay went on to play with them, and they got a few more.

274
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like doing stuff like that, helping people out.

275
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played some Killer.

276
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,344
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun, kind of.

277
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:08,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played more of Avatar.

278
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing The Secret of the Spires, which is, to me, a lot more fun than the last DLC.

279
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:20,556
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get that finished before a certain movie comes out.

280
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And played some Palia.

281
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:30,690
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally have bought yet another property, and I'm now trying to save up enough money to put stuff on it.

282
00:24:31,025 --> 00:24:57,690
[SPEAKER_01]: um um played some Suica game uh some Bellatro um oh yeah and uh uh Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight or Symphony of the Night for Saturn played a good bit of that got to the Reverse Castle good times all right Loki we'll go to you how was your gaming week

283
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:26,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I just played Minecraft stuff so we had a there was CubeCon this weekend which is an in-game Minecraft convention so went and explored that for a bit it's still going to be up for the next week if you haven't gotten a chance to check it out or want to you can do that our SMP has a booth there as well and there's like mini games and stuff I don't know so we did that and we're just working on stuff in-game as well put out a video

284
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:31,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm setting up a build contest right now and yeah, that's pretty much it.

285
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:58,069
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome um my gaming week was interesting um i'm still continuing my adventures in final fantasy 11 i finally hit uh level 50 which means i need to do my limit break but i'm playing on that server that has the the xp gains out the wazoo so there's that i've also been playing the very aptly timed uh re-release remaster of final fantasy tactics i played a little bit of that on playstation this week before i went out of town this weekend and um

286
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:25,120
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's it's you can choose if you want to play the remake version or the original version um if you just want to play basically the the ps1 obviously i went for the newer one to just kind of check out the voice acting which of course is well done and just some of the you know other changes they've made to it such as um uh kind of the way you'd like i was instinctively trying to hit l1 and r1 to rotate the board but that's not how it works anymore you use the other set or if maybe i was wrong maybe my muscle memory failed me which is completely possible

287
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But you use the other stick and now there's like a tactical view you can use, which is kind of neat.

288
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:31,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I've been enjoying it.

289
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:40,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not usually into tactical games, but for some reason I always have given Final Fantasy Tactics a pass, probably just because I'm a Final Fantasy fan at heart.

290
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:49,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am working on the thing that many of you do, which is grinding that first area over and over and over again to get up my job levels until I have to take on the actual story quests.

291
00:26:49,973 --> 00:27:07,071
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

292
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up going to Knott's Berry Farm, which I have never been to before.

293
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:15,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was completely on a whim, thanks to an internet friend of mine who was like, hey, I have extra tickets.

294
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:16,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to go?

295
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like, fuck yeah, let's go to Knott's Berry Farm.

296
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:21,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not get to go to Knott's Scary Farm.

297
00:27:21,616 --> 00:27:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a different thing in the evening, sadly.

298
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been to the park outside of the restaurant.

299
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was cute.

300
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cute.

301
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:49,579
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

302
00:27:49,559 --> 00:28:12,377
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:19,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually went and we did the Fallout maze, which is based on the Amazon TV show, I think a little more than the games.

304
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,556
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely got I haven't seen the TV show yet.

305
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, I've seen the game.

306
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:35,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the games at least a little bit well enough to recognize like, oh, the same little mascots that you see in the game are in the little queue as you're in the thing that the haunted house itself.

307
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:54,075
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

308
00:28:54,055 --> 00:28:55,377
[SPEAKER_05]: and are working.

309
00:28:55,397 --> 00:29:00,445
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's still a black light maze where people are trying to jump out of the corner and say, boo.

310
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:09,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But because so many people are moving through it so quickly, if you just look ahead of you, you can see where all the people are jumping out trying to scare people.

311
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was just kind of like, okay.

312
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:16,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was having a funny observation with my pal Victoria coming out of there.

313
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:22,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it's something about the year 2025 where I think people just are like, you know what?

314
00:29:22,878 --> 00:29:23,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill me.

315
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:24,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it quick.

316
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:24,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

317
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:25,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Just off me.

318
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:26,263
[SPEAKER_05]: End it all.

319
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

320
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:39,064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really taking the fun out of this stuff because we were in an area, so we did the tram tour, and you'd end up doing this little walkthrough that's like scenes from Megan.

321
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:40,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the Blumhouse films.

322
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So The Purge was one of them.

323
00:29:42,149 --> 00:30:08,697
[SPEAKER_05]: and there were those big there were those big clowns on stilts and one of them comes up to me goes rah you know trying to scare me and I'm just like you know what I literally I did this and I'm not even trying to be an edgelord or anything I just like literally just my knee-jerk Daria reaction was you know what just do it quick Trump's America couldn't be me like that literally was what I said I'm not even embellishing I literally looked this guy dead in the eye did it and do you know what his response was hmm

324
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:14,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's my territory.

325
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:18,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's just funny to me.

326
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:23,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

327
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:37,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

328
00:30:37,955 --> 00:31:05,380
[SPEAKER_05]: so the fallout thing and you know I usually and it's again I get scared pretty easy and I don't like jump scares but because I could look ahead like I could see where all the scares were and there was this guy that came rushing and I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep it real he was an attractive killer he was it was like like the guys that play Norman Bates at Universal he was an attractive killer and he came rushing at me with a pipe and I just gave him a look like this

329
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:15,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I just looked at him like, you know, kind of like, and sorry podcast folks, but I'm giving a look of like, okay, like I'm just looking, I'm like, okay, do it.

330
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:19,621
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the upper pointed side eye.

331
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:25,613
[SPEAKER_05]: His response is, as he got to me, he just saluted, he gave me a little two finger salute and walked back.

332
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:29,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost funny to me.

333
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:30,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad.

334
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:35,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I should probably just play along and act scared and that whole thing.

335
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:44,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time, but I also was three very expensive beverages in by the time we got to the Fallout maze.

336
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just like, I don't...

337
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:51,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is just kind of... Everything just exists right now.

338
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:55,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I am but a mere projection onto this plane of existence.

339
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, you know, I'm just making my way through a maze.

340
00:31:58,537 --> 00:31:59,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Making my way downtown.

341
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Disassociating your way through life.

342
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

343
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:04,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's that.

344
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:09,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my review of the Fallout maze was... Sorry, y'all.

345
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I disassociated.

346
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say I was there, but that was only half right.

347
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there in body.

348
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:21,024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

349
00:32:21,044 --> 00:32:22,246
[SPEAKER_05]: The makeup was well done, though.

350
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:24,648
[SPEAKER_05]: The makeup was well done.

351
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,692
[SPEAKER_05]: The creepy-looking creatures and stuff, they looked good.

352
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:31,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, again, I mean, you can get the same type of scares at the local.

353
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would actually encourage you, go support your local haunted house.

354
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,644
[SPEAKER_05]: These are a lot of the same people I work with when the horror movie and the horror hosting.

355
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:42,829
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just artists that are taking a seasonal gig to help pay the rent and stuff.

356
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Go support your local stuff.

357
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:54,625
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, Universal, they're really not doing anything that much different than what you could get locally, except for an FX budget, which is money well spent.

358
00:32:54,965 --> 00:33:00,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks very good and everybody looks good, but you know, that's that.

359
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:00,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

360
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:05,360
[SPEAKER_05]: SS2100Matt says, Rob, you and I both want to go out the same way.

361
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Rollercoaster ride set to Rihanna and changing to Adele as it crashes.

362
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:09,926
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

363
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,327
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

364
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:11,248
[SPEAKER_05]: No Adele.

365
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,870
[SPEAKER_05]: No Adele.

366
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:15,554
[SPEAKER_01]: No Adele, please.

367
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the reference to that one meme.

368
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:28,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It can, you know, it could be, it could actually be, if you don't want Adele, it could actually be the Lady Gaga song, You and I, if that would be an acceptable alternative.

369
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:29,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

370
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

371
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:32,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's it for our gaming week.

372
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:35,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some more gaming news.

373
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:38,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, the hits just keep on coming.

374
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's a follow up to last week, right?

375
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:41,575
Yeah.

376
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:43,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just keeps getting better.

377
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:46,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, I know you love EA.

378
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,795
[SPEAKER_04]: You just love EA and all their practices.

379
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:53,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, man, EA is just so infallible.

380
00:33:54,022 --> 00:33:58,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank goodness there's no way I could possibly hate EA by one of their business practices.

381
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, selling their company to the Saudis that kill people.

382
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That don't agree with them.

383
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:06,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

384
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:07,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

385
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:13,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, $55 billion deal to take the company private.

386
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, because I know there are two things being typed in chat right now.

387
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:20,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, Saudi already had an investment in EA.

388
00:34:20,676 --> 00:34:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: They already owned about 9% of the company.

389
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, Saudi also has a stake in Nintendo.

390
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:29,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So I loved the way Bobby... Yeah, but 9 to 100, though.

391
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:30,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

392
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:30,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

393
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:31,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this.

394
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved the way Bobby put this on his show.

395
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:37,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to give credit to our show before us live.

396
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:43,269
[SPEAKER_05]: The way Bobby put this on his show was he says, Saudi Arabia is going for a cultural victory in civilization.

397
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's an accurate analogy.

398
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Bobby.

399
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:50,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm stealing that.

400
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Without payment.

401
00:34:54,978 --> 00:35:11,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Jared Kushner's Private Equity Group

402
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:12,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross.

403
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:21,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, so, you know, some concerns, obviously, with, you know, Saudi Arabia owning this company is, you know, censorship.

404
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:27,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Games like, you know, Mass Effect and stuff like that, they have, you know...

405
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:52,457
[SPEAKER_04]: gay, trans characters, I'm not sure if there's trans characters in but essentially a wide variety of sexual orientations amongst the characters that's not going to probably be just say Mass Effect I said Mass Effect and there was trans in Andromeda because it was actually a point of contention but it's old news at this point

406
00:35:52,437 --> 00:36:02,791
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, well, that said, though, those diverse characters with those types of backgrounds are probably not going to be featured in games, you know, going forward.

407
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:11,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, honestly, you know, with like the sports washing stuff that they've done recently with purchasing was the stuff with the WWE.

408
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:16,690
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, you know, events going on there, comedy festivals, you

409
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:23,597
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the whole golf, they have their own golf circuit thing that's in Saudi Arabia as well.

410
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:35,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't see this going well, but also I see this kind of ironically, it's ironically an interesting way for EA to possibly, like their demise.

411
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:45,057
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whereas EA is a company that used to purchase a bunch of smaller companies and then take those companies, essentially strip their assets from them and then close those companies and

412
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:46,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this!

413
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come full circle.

414
00:36:49,142 --> 00:37:00,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a private equity group that purchased EA that will of course try to do well with it, but inevitably will strip its assets and sell it off piecemeal.

415
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:01,408
[SPEAKER_04]: How appropriate.

416
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:07,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, Bob Coffee in chat says Asadi Group also bought the EVO tournament.

417
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Asadi Group also owns what part of wrestling?

418
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:15,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Asadi Group owns – like there's a lot of – I'm sure – I think one of the big networks, Asadi has an investment in that too.

419
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:23,234
[SPEAKER_05]: If only there was a governing body that could do something about these types of sales such as saying, no, you can't have these types of sales.

420
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: If only there were a governing body that could do that.

421
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:28,662
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh, when –

422
00:37:28,642 --> 00:37:37,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that's why you get the son-in-law involved, and now the president will have a personal stake in this particular type of acquisition.

423
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And President Carter sold his peanut farm, but I guess those sorts of norms just don't exist anymore.

424
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't exist anymore.

425
00:37:49,426 --> 00:37:49,986
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have norms.

426
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:53,350
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going through is not normal.

427
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bob Coffey says, if only we had a functional federal government.

428
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:56,974
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

429
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:01,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why maybe, maybe that's why this waited until now.

430
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

431
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say if your favorite EA game is not a sports game, is not a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game called, you know, what's not Call of Duty, the other one, Battlefield.

432
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:21,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's shooty, shooty, bang, bang.

433
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:25,602
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, if it's not a shooty, bang, bang game and if it's not The Sims.

434
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:25,902
Yeah.

435
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,613
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably in trouble.

436
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, that includes Mass Effect.

437
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:42,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best thing because because what's going to happen now, I want to go back to something I said earlier about people as as much of an issue as Phil Spencer has been these last couple of years.

438
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:46,793
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, you wanted to root for him a little bit because he was an actual gamer.

439
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:49,436
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen with this EA thing?

440
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:54,822
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people who are not gamers are going to get in the room, and they're going to look at Bioware.

441
00:38:55,203 --> 00:38:57,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at this studio's performance.

442
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:59,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what have they been working on?

443
00:38:59,107 --> 00:39:00,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they put out a game last year.

444
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that game didn't really make the money we were thinking it was going to make.

445
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:07,577
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what did that studio do before that?

446
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:08,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Anthem.

447
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:14,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're saying this studio hasn't really put out a profitable game?

448
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:16,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

449
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, huh.

450
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I think we got $20 billion in debt.

451
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:37,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the best you can hope for in this situation is that Mass Effect becomes an asset that is put up for sale that another company who will know how to treat it with dignity will buy it.

452
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:45,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the ironic thing, the ironic thing is that the people that probably want BioWare the most

453
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

454
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

455
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:49,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft.

456
00:39:52,728 --> 00:39:54,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would be the first to put a bid on BioWare?

457
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft.

458
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:57,153
[SPEAKER_05]: With what money?

459
00:39:57,754 --> 00:40:00,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And there lies the rub.

460
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:15,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't, you know, I would, you know, of course, I sit here and cross my fingers and my toes and go, is there a way that there can be a fire sale on Bioshock's IPs and, like, Larian can pick it up?

461
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:35,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the fog comes a mysterious stranger It is Atari

462
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:39,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm not going to hate on that.

463
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:43,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Atari hasn't had a lot of losing decisions lately.

464
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:45,291
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of like Konami.

465
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:48,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Atari and Konami are on similar paths.

466
00:40:48,538 --> 00:40:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: They were laughable 10, 15 years ago, but right now it's kind of like, you're doing good, kid.

467
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep at it, you know?

468
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:56,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

469
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:01,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there is any possible way, Bioware could go single again.

470
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,974
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be incredible, but I worry about that.

471
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:07,197
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's happened before.

472
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:10,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that as a match in heaven.

473
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:23,916
[SPEAKER_05]: That is like the light your candle before you go to bed tonight in hopes that that, or whatever it is you believe in, thoughts and prayers, whatever it takes, let Larian buy the Bioware IPs in a fire sale and let's get back to the old Bioware.

474
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Buster in chat says, I wouldn't be surprised if Ailguard was the last Dragon Age we'll ever see, if not for a long, long time because it missed performance targets unless it's handed to someone else.

475
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, unless it's an IP that's sold off, which I would say do not rule out that possibility.

476
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:48,570
[SPEAKER_05]: That a room full of non-gamer boardroom types will not understand the value of some of these IPs.

477
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:52,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

478
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:55,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just who's going to buy them is the risk there.

479
00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:57,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep all the Bioware stuff together.

480
00:41:57,836 --> 00:42:01,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeger in chat is saying, the Sims is crazy in trouble with this deal.

481
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:08,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be curious for you to evaluate because I thought that series actually made EA quite a bit of money even all this time later.

482
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:10,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got a new one ready to launch, right?

483
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:15,090
[SPEAKER_01]: They just... Their problem with the Sims is their oversaturation.

484
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:34,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if they've had the money to build, what, 74 expansion packs for the last Sims game, I feel like that's something that, at least on paper, they're going to look... This is going to come down to an Excel spreadsheet, whether a studio is running or closing.

485
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:35,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob.

486
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:35,506
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

487
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:37,128
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be Excel.

488
00:42:37,168 --> 00:42:37,828
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in numbers.

489
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:47,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, considering the subject matter, I think you should let it be with Excel that these studios could be coming and going.

490
00:42:48,478 --> 00:42:54,804
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100 Matt says, My only hope is that when they lay off employees that they treat them well and give them good severance packages.

491
00:42:54,824 --> 00:43:00,088
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be terrible if they do the, quote, soft layoff route that many tech companies are doing these days.

492
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:04,052
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice, and I don't want to be –

493
00:43:04,032 --> 00:43:08,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pessimistic about it, but unfortunately I am.

494
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope, yes, I hope you're right.

495
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:15,516
[SPEAKER_05]: SG-100 Matt says, this won't go through until 2027, so there is time, but not much.

496
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:18,801
[SPEAKER_05]: There is stuff that will go down sooner rather than later.

497
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I would expect to see things start to move around in months, not years.

498
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:34,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeger is elaborating on the Sims stuff, saying Sims is not doing super well, and the themes...

499
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a source for that?

500
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:41,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's just I'm kind of like, again, they've had so many expansions.

501
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:44,949
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in a holding pattern now because we haven't had a mainline game in a long time.

502
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:49,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, super LGBTQ stuff would be in danger.

503
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:52,975
[SPEAKER_05]: The player base is also primarily LGBTQ+, as well.

504
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:54,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So take those options away and it's done.

505
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that part I'm with you with.

506
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:57,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, with you on.

507
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that part does make sense.

508
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:04,465
[SPEAKER_05]: That, unfortunately, those types of themes, they're going to say no...

509
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate myself with every fiber of my being for what I'm about to say.

510
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:12,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're going to say no woke games.

511
00:44:12,514 --> 00:44:13,596
[SPEAKER_05]: No woke games.

512
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:19,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to wash my mouth out with soap after saying that.

513
00:44:19,888 --> 00:44:20,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

514
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,532
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just, you know.

515
00:44:23,215 --> 00:44:23,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I wrong?

516
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I don't think I am.

517
00:44:29,977 --> 00:44:31,079
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

518
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, moving on.

519
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:40,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to something, a bit of good news, you know, because and maybe this is what ends up happening.

520
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:47,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard of this sort of thing before is that when the gaming industry starts to buckle and starts to sort of

521
00:44:47,830 --> 00:45:17,213
[SPEAKER_05]: you know experience a recession of sorts which I kind of think we've been hurling towards for a while now and this is all just going to accelerate that inevitable happenstance I think there's going to be a lot of people looking at the classics a lot of people looking at old games a lot of people finally looking at their backlog going there's a lot of good games out there I haven't played I should go play some of the Loki will finally go check out his fucking Steam backlog I just added more games to it today it's a self read

522
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:19,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the sale's going on too, right?

523
00:45:19,798 --> 00:45:20,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

524
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I have months and months and months of humble choice that I forget to redeem.

525
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:31,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's like, ooh, Plucky Squire, cool.

526
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:32,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw that in the backlog.

527
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:34,524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a bunch of games.

528
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never going to get around to playing

529
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:43,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, the nice thing is there's still a soft spot for nostalgia and nostalgia for these old games will probably squeeze us through.

530
00:45:43,917 --> 00:45:48,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the Lego Game Boy came out recently, and that's been kind of in the news.

531
00:45:48,503 --> 00:45:53,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot of people posting their builds online and people are really excited about this Lego Game Boy.

532
00:45:54,191 --> 00:45:58,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the question was probably out there from the very beginning of how long is it going to take?

533
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:02,201
[SPEAKER_05]: for somebody to shove a real Game Boy into a Lego Game Boy.

534
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it turns out, not long at all.

535
00:46:05,505 --> 00:46:23,465
[SPEAKER_05]: A creator online named NatalieTheNerd, who has a blog on the website NatalieTheNerd.com, actually used this system, the Lego system, to add power to it to actually play genuine Game Boy cartridges.

536
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:26,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to see her post over on Blue Sky, you can.

537
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:28,611
[SPEAKER_05]: She is also verified by Donut

538
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:48,135
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

539
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

540
00:46:51,736 --> 00:47:06,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

541
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:10,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting to put a Game Boy inside your Game Boy is always going to be good news.

542
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:16,295
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, yeah, you can use it to play small screen games on there.

543
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:20,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's not like this is something that's commercially available out there.

544
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:27,411
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some fixes that still need to be made, like the A and B keys are currently being held in by an elastic band.

545
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:30,896
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a 3D printed Lego piece to help fix some of this.

546
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:36,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she does say, I'm going to release this once I'm happy with it, which I would assume would mean...

547
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:39,867
[SPEAKER_05]: all the parts that you need and 3D printing specs you need to build your own.

548
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if she doesn't do it soon, I'm sure somebody else will.

549
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:47,315
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a read.

550
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just if it really is supposed to be Patreon paywalled, it's probably a matter of time before somebody else does it anyway.

551
00:47:55,523 --> 00:47:57,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's neat, though.

552
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:02,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat to see people using those nostalgia products for their nostalgia.

553
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

554
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:10,138
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100 Matt points out, I'll finish my LEGO Game Boy build tonight after the show.

555
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And QuestBuster says, yay Game Boy goodness.

556
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:13,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

557
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:18,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a bunch of the classic Game Boy stuff on my Steam Deck.

558
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:30,744
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the first, if you had a Game Boy emulator in front of you with every Game Boy, a LEGO Game Boy with every Game Boy game, what's the first game you'd want to play on it again?

559
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:31,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Revenge of the Gator.

560
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You took my answer.

561
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:40,740
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the right answer, Revenge of the Game Fine, Pokemon Pinball Or was that Advance?

562
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:50,235
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think there was a Pokemon I think Pokemon Pinball, Red and Blue Or maybe Kid Dracula Okay, okay But I actually have Kid Dracula Loki, what's your answer?

563
00:48:51,497 --> 00:48:59,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I do have a Game Boy emulator in front of me But I would say probably there's a...

564
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:10,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Homebrew Mario game that rescales like because, you know, they ported like the original Mario Brothers to it and stuff like that.

565
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But the like scaling was really weird on the Game Boy.

566
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:19,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would play that port with the additional levels and stuff because it's fun.

567
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf agrees, Revenge of the Gator.

568
00:49:21,656 --> 00:49:23,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranmari says Yoshi's Cookie.

569
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:23,900
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good choice, too.

570
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTutsia says Tetris.

571
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:29,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, a standard.

572
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Hyper Lode Runner.

573
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:35,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And OrangeRite says Triple Jinx with Bobby Blackwolf and DarkSakura.

574
00:49:36,165 --> 00:49:37,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Great minds think like us.

575
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:39,151
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

576
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:40,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

577
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:40,935
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

578
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:45,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is not just good news.

579
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,274
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty freaking great.

580
00:49:47,975 --> 00:50:11,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a local monthly fighting game tournament and a new mom who goes by Legion with a zero, a 3D artist actually who sometimes plays fighting games, basically won the tournament with her newborn in her lap five days after a C-section.

581
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:15,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hear any of your excuses, guys, okay?

582
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what a C-section does to you?

583
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:22,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how much it hurts to recover from?

584
00:50:22,837 --> 00:50:24,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I've had one.

585
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a surgery, yeah.

586
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,283
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do own a uterus.

587
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:37,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have a good background in anatomy, and I know what happens to the body during pregnancy, which is why I don't ever want to do it.

588
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:38,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

589
00:50:39,269 --> 00:51:06,711
[SPEAKER_01]: but imagine that so that you have been cut open while you are awake having a living being taken from your body sewn back up and five days later winning a Mortal Kombat tournament with this tiny brilliant miracle of a human being in your arms I don't want to hear your excuses I don't have don't want to hear them I don't have any excuses but can I make a joke

590
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, the best thing, the best thing.

591
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:09,691
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the kid's name is?

592
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:11,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Cereza.

593
00:51:13,677 --> 00:51:15,079
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the contestant's name again?

594
00:51:17,683 --> 00:51:18,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Legion.

595
00:51:18,605 --> 00:51:19,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Legion.

596
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:21,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say Legion wins.

597
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:23,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Babality.

598
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:31,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, but you get where the baby's name comes from, right?

599
00:51:31,514 --> 00:51:32,515
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

600
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:34,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I was marinating too much.

601
00:51:34,457 --> 00:51:34,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Bayonetta.

602
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good one.

603
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:38,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

604
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

605
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:41,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I was marinating too much on my Vivaldi joke.

606
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:42,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, let me say my joke.

607
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:43,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me say my joke.

608
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:44,545
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

609
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:47,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you're not the first to make it, for the record.

610
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

611
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Great minds think like me.

612
00:51:52,232 --> 00:52:01,420
[SPEAKER_01]: But she, with the win, one of her posts says, I only win because she coached me mid-set sending our daughter to DreamHack.

613
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:09,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, she has a habit of trying to bite my chest whenever I hold her upright so her face was smooshed for a fraction of a sec.

614
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:12,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cute.

615
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:13,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's cute.

616
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cute.

617
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

618
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:31,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great story about, yeah, again, if you thought you had a hard week or you can't do something because of it's hard or something, it's a nice story to remind us.

619
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:33,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You can probably do more than you think you can.

620
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:35,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

621
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:35,658
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

622
00:52:36,478 --> 00:52:40,523
[SPEAKER_05]: But what you can't do right now is not patch your Unity game, right, Loki?

623
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:40,823
Yeah.

624
00:52:41,647 --> 00:53:01,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you probably could patch your Unity game, but it is going to be a little bit tricky because there was a recently discovered security vulnerability that affected any games and applications built on Unity version 2017.1 and later.

625
00:53:01,373 --> 00:53:03,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

626
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:17,593
[SPEAKER_04]: For Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, there's no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers, according to Larry, Major Nelson Herb.

627
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:27,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, along with that, though, Obsidian Entertainment did pull their Pillars of Eternity 2, Deadfire, and Pentament,

628
00:53:27,125 --> 00:53:33,756
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as more games from Steam on Friday just as a precautionary measure.

629
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:38,784
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be rolling out a patch for that though to fix the vulnerability.

630
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:42,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't opened Unity in a while.

631
00:53:42,953 --> 00:54:07,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely saw games getting patched this week Ingress and the Niantic stuff was definitely getting all patched I feel like I had a lot of phone apps update this week which makes sense, Unity is used in a lot of phone game development and boy are they keeping a tight lip on what the vulnerability really was which makes sense, they don't want people to actually there's a lot of games that haven't patched yet and they don't want to get out there

632
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:08,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them any ideas.

633
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:08,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

634
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give them any ideas type of thing.

635
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:19,230
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course you want to know like, well, shit, how bad is it that they've got to be doing all these games and stuff this week?

636
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:23,395
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not going to know because that's the plan is to not tell us.

637
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:29,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say, was this an ethical hacker that figured this out and sent it to Unity?

638
00:54:29,382 --> 00:54:33,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it sounds like somebody found this and instead of doing anything –

639
00:54:33,427 --> 00:54:39,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative with it, they went straight to Unity and were like, hey, I found a problem.

640
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:47,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think it mentions who reported it, but yeah, somehow they found it, so...

641
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:51,105
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt says, I'm sure YYR had to update stuff.

642
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:55,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hopefully the process isn't too difficult.

643
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:13,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I heard Bobby talking a little bit about this on his show, and it sounds like you don't have to get in there and update a bunch of code, that it has more to do with the actual executable runtime file, and you can patch that even if you don't have all your old code.

644
00:55:13,049 --> 00:55:23,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of nice that, you know, you don't go because heaven forbid, there's probably a lot of studios that have closed since 2017 that have Unity games that are actually running.

645
00:55:23,092 --> 00:55:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, hopefully YYR is able to update his stuff.

646
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,053
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem as well, because I would hate to see them start pulling games that don't adhere to this.

647
00:55:32,033 --> 00:55:46,574
[SPEAKER_05]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, the vulnerability was, quoting from the email that was sent to Unity, or from Unity, says, the vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher Ryotak, and we thank him for working with us.

648
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:55,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's a very nice way of saying ethical hacker, which actually I don't think is a negative term at all, but probably not a polite one in the context of an email like this.

649
00:55:55,847 --> 00:56:00,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, I mean, that guy could have done some shitty things, or

650
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: or Person.

651
00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:05,881
[SPEAKER_05]: That person could have done a lot of shitty things with that information, but they didn't.

652
00:56:05,901 --> 00:56:08,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So good on them.

653
00:56:10,927 --> 00:56:11,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

654
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Politics, politics, politics.

655
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:15,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never ending.

656
00:56:15,233 --> 00:56:15,854
[SPEAKER_05]: But guess what?

657
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,477
[SPEAKER_05]: This one has nothing to do with us.

658
00:56:18,578 --> 00:56:19,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a little bit maybe.

659
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:21,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It has more to do with what's going on in Japan.

660
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:44,700
[SPEAKER_05]: and a politician from Japan's House of Representatives, Satoshi Asano, made a post on social media saying that Nintendo was "...avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP and "...engaging in lobbying activities with the government."

661
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:48,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo actually came out and denied this.

662
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:53,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a rare thing for Nintendo to do.

663
00:56:54,867 --> 00:57:11,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the right-wing social media site X, Nintendo's account, their Japanese account, actually published a statement that says, "...contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI."

664
00:57:11,292 --> 00:57:34,161
[SPEAKER_05]: whether generative AI is involved or not we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights and that was the particular post there from Nintendo that they actually posted interesting that they actually called that out um

665
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:40,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right, you better.

666
00:57:40,997 --> 00:57:57,735
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?

667
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:05,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, I'm speechless.

668
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:09,512
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to get a jump, is what they're trying to do.

669
00:58:09,572 --> 00:58:12,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be nice if that's how it was?

670
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be nice if when people were wrong, they say, oops, I was wrong and I'm sorry?

671
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:28,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be what people of integrity and high... I think it's a foreign concept here, though.

672
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

673
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:29,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

674
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:51,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, outgoing Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has talked about Nintendo's and AI previously saying, quote, if we think about just technology in general to start with, as we look at technology, we always want to make sure the technology we may be leveraging, whether it's to develop our games or in our devices, it's going to create a better gameplay experience.

675
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts there.

676
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:59,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very important part of our decision-making process and how to use AI, which honestly is a real fluff statement.

677
00:58:59,123 --> 00:59:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does go to show at least that they're not being reckless about it.

678
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:12,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It does sort of say to me the justification for is the game fun needs to still be there.

679
00:59:12,962 --> 00:59:15,746
[SPEAKER_05]: If we use AI on our game, is the game still going to be fun?

680
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,689
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be our driving principle.

681
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: which is not a bad principle to have especially compared to peers because that says to me you're thinking less about generative AI and that crap and cutting or especially when it comes to art and that kind of crap and more like maybe how can our own internal mechanisms you know sort of improve and so forth which you know it's interesting it's interesting but they have not said anything as far as the official Japanese government goes

682
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, yeah, and Rinmari does point out where Japanese people still post, it's because they don't know any better.

683
00:59:56,216 --> 01:00:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them try Blue Sky or Miski for five seconds and just go back to Twitter.

684
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:02,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

685
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:07,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to remind folks where the money you make on X, where that goes.

686
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:12,054
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's if you still decide, that's fine.

687
01:00:12,074 --> 01:00:12,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you.

688
01:00:13,315 --> 01:00:14,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

689
01:00:14,116 --> 01:00:41,423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

690
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:50,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in one of the happier pieces of news, I get the happy stuff today, don't I?

691
01:00:52,312 --> 01:00:56,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's more good Silent Hill news.

692
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:04,356
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a remake of the first Silent Hill, and it's already going into full production, working with Bloober Team.

693
01:01:04,336 --> 01:01:09,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they said, I'm going to read the translated statement.

694
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:12,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is, uh, during an investor call.

695
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:21,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two first party production teams, one of which is working on Silent Hill one project and the other started working on the next project.

696
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:22,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be Silent Hill three.

697
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:28,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then they also discussed, uh, Kronos, the new Dawn, um,

698
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:40,671
[SPEAKER_01]: which got really good reviews but Konami did tease it already with those photos and stuff but this is good news this is good news

699
01:01:42,338 --> 01:01:48,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially, you know, when there was a little bit of worry about the Silent Hill 2 remake and it turned out pretty good.

700
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:52,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's, I feel like everybody's kind of at ease about this.

701
01:01:52,638 --> 01:01:53,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all right, bring it on.

702
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.

703
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:56,685
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Bloober, you did something.

704
01:01:56,705 --> 01:01:57,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

705
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:57,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

706
01:01:57,767 --> 01:01:58,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it again.

707
01:01:58,409 --> 01:01:59,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Two in a row.

708
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't.

709
01:02:00,192 --> 01:02:04,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want Silent Hill 3 because, you know, that's my favorite of them all.

710
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:04,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

711
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:31,330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

712
01:02:32,744 --> 01:02:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so this is disappointing, but apparently Avalanche Studios has announced that their studio located in Liverpool is shutting down.

713
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:53,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really heard much from them as far as new games coming out, but I know that one that obviously comes to mind for me is Just Cause.

714
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:54,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that series.

715
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:00,709
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, apparently they posted a short update saying that the company...

716
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: has been that all employees will be impacted and that that Liverpool location is being closed.

717
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:16,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be planning layoffs for its Swedish studios as well in Malmo in Stockholm.

718
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:19,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that sucks.

719
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:24,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that could be because we haven't heard of any games that they're putting out.

720
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:47,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they're working on a game called Contraband but I haven't heard too much about that other than that and that was announced back in 2021 um yeah that sucks but if you don't have the revenue coming in I guess that makes sense I mean it's just one after another and it's one week this is one week in 2025 I don't know what else to say

721
01:03:48,344 --> 01:03:54,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about Departure from the Mortal Kombat studio.

722
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one you might recognize.

723
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:59,349
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the guy that says, Toasty!

724
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:06,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's been a few years since that guy showed up because he was with, and this is Dan Forden who we're talking about, who was the audio director at Mortal Kombat.

725
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,390
[SPEAKER_05]: He was with that studio for 30 years.

726
01:04:10,211 --> 01:04:11,212
[SPEAKER_05]: He left NetherRealm.

727
01:04:11,232 --> 01:04:11,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he left.

728
01:04:12,553 --> 01:04:20,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And on October 2nd, he made a post to Instagram that Wednesday was his last... I'm just laughing at all the social media announcements.

729
01:04:20,301 --> 01:04:23,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That Wednesday was his last day at NetherRealm.

730
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:33,235
[SPEAKER_05]: And previously, he went all the way back to Midway Chicago and worked pretty much through Mortal Kombat 1, which came out a couple years ago.

731
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:35,608
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course you know him as the toasty guy.

732
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:37,740
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks a lot different now.

733
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:40,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Age, it happens, right?

734
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:47,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Toasty Dan is who he's referred to as sometimes online.

735
01:04:47,197 --> 01:04:49,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting quotes in his goodbye post.

736
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,844
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, we made a lot of fun stuff over the years.

737
01:04:52,864 --> 01:04:57,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff.

738
01:04:57,329 --> 01:04:59,572
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many smart, talented people there.

739
01:04:59,932 --> 01:05:04,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.

740
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:04,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

741
01:05:04,838 --> 01:05:13,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to all of you in supporting what we've done.

742
01:05:15,014 --> 01:05:16,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye and good luck.

743
01:05:17,191 --> 01:05:18,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy retirement, though, dude.

744
01:05:19,014 --> 01:05:19,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You earned it.

745
01:05:19,935 --> 01:05:21,558
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely left a legacy in gaming.

746
01:05:23,061 --> 01:05:24,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the toasty thing.

747
01:05:24,763 --> 01:05:30,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think the sound in the Mortal Kombat games is part of what makes those games great.

748
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:36,162
[SPEAKER_05]: It put it on a different... It distincted itself from Street Fighter.

749
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is a very different musical style too yeah not yeah the music and the sound effects it just it lent itself to that style that made it different from Street Fighter at the end of the day and um yeah so enjoy retirement hope you hope you get some you know like cruises or whatever it is you enjoy all right anyway uh let's get to our next segment another classic

750
01:06:09,301 --> 01:06:17,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

751
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:20,161
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

752
01:06:20,582 --> 01:06:24,009
[SPEAKER_05]: But tonight we have a once a month special.

753
01:06:24,229 --> 01:06:29,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the classic arcade game that then became a console game.

754
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is our classic arcade to console game this week, DarkSakura?

755
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike.

756
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:39,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, this one became console to arcade back to console.

757
01:06:40,524 --> 01:06:50,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, I am referring to the version for the versus Unisystem, as in versus Excitebike.

758
01:06:50,459 --> 01:06:56,847
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two enhanced versions, both that were titled versus Excitebike.

759
01:06:57,208 --> 01:07:00,412
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start, though, with the arcade version.

760
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:14,890
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in 1984, and it's very similar to the Famicom disc version, even though it lacks, of course, the design option for custom tracks.

761
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:17,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It has three difficulty levels and a few other differences.

762
01:07:17,994 --> 01:07:19,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And among these differences...

763
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:25,711
[SPEAKER_01]: is, well, I mean, first of all, it has seven tracks instead of five, like the NES.

764
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:30,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're more like remix tracks is what they are.

765
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:36,177
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you finish the seventh track, the last stage will just loop itself until you lose.

766
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:38,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it is pretty repetitive.

767
01:07:39,046 --> 01:07:50,149
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other cool features that it has is that there is a bonus game that will challenge you to hit ramps in order to jump over stacked trucks for extra points.

768
01:07:50,534 --> 01:08:11,699
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the other one is sort of like a wipeout mode where you have to make the other players crash and then your character will change colors going from, you know, go to red, yellow or a black color scheme and have unlimited turbo until you crash.

769
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,183
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's Excitebike.

770
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Now...

771
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:23,498
[SPEAKER_01]: The other version is Versus Excite for the Famicom Disk System.

772
01:08:24,259 --> 01:08:27,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically you can play Versus.

773
01:08:27,744 --> 01:08:28,645
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play with a friend.

774
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:33,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has different music done by Okasoyo.

775
01:08:34,432 --> 01:08:44,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have original Excite mode where it's based off of the main mode of the arcade version with some minor differences like the color palette.

776
01:08:44,365 --> 01:08:46,990
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is a writable disc that can save your tracks.

777
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:59,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought that up because it's sort of getting an arcade port of a port of a home game

778
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:06,202
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the arcade port of the home game, and then you have a home game port of the arcade game.

779
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:09,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what I just said.

780
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:10,068
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I get it.

781
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way that makes sense.

782
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,774
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's wild, yeah, how this kind of went back and forth and back and forth, right?

783
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:21,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And that version, for the record, I do believe has come out on a virtual arcade since.

784
01:09:25,148 --> 01:09:25,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

785
01:09:26,553 --> 01:09:27,674
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

786
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:28,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Your arcade console game.

787
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:30,837
[SPEAKER_05]: A favorite of mine, actually.

788
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:32,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Excitebike.

789
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:34,621
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there was a BS Excitebike?

790
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:45,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was a BS Excitebike, and there was one on the 3DS that I think was based off the arcade version.

791
01:09:45,312 --> 01:09:47,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember, but there was a 3DS one.

792
01:09:47,094 --> 01:09:48,896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the virtual console one, right?

793
01:09:49,536 --> 01:09:50,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different.

794
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:53,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually had the layers, like Kid Icarus had one, too.

795
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was Boom Boom Mario Battle Stadium.

796
01:09:56,486 --> 01:09:57,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

797
01:09:57,828 --> 01:10:08,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike Boom Boom Mario Battle Station, which is also known as Mario Excitebike, or BS Excitebike, was a remake that only came out for this to tell of you, but I think that that one was re-released.

798
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, I'm just double-checking that one.

799
01:10:12,294 --> 01:10:14,818
[SPEAKER_01]: There was 3D Classics Excitebike.

800
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:20,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I actually done Excitebike as a classic game?

801
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:21,851
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to think that I did.

802
01:10:23,074 --> 01:10:25,500
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the one that has like the...

803
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:28,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wrong.

804
01:10:28,268 --> 01:10:32,473
[SPEAKER_01]: That was back to the Satellaview one, which was Mario, Luigi, Princess, Peach, Wario, and Toad.

805
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:36,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I see.

806
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:44,706
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an Animal Crossing No, that was the one that was in Animal Crossing that could be transferred to Game Boy Advance.

807
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:47,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking through it now because I didn't read through the rest of the stuff.

808
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:55,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike was added to Wii's Virtual Console the day that Excite Truck was released.

809
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:12,105
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it later came out on the North American Virtual Console and then there were 3D Classics Excitebike on the 3DS and had stereoscopic support and it didn't say anything about the characters.

810
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

811
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:20,530
[SPEAKER_05]: but still a true classic, especially on the Nintendo front in all its different forms.

812
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:25,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's important to note and you're kind of bringing to the forefront by highlighting the arcade version.

813
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:33,658
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many versions of this game that are different from what you would have played on the Nintendo Entertainment System and not just the fact that you had a very...

814
01:11:33,638 --> 01:11:40,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, kind of lazy port of a Famicom Disk System game where the save and load were left in, you know, type of thing.

815
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:46,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just that, but just, you know, the fact that they actually, you know, different courses and there are more of them and all the other things you pointed out.

816
01:11:46,684 --> 01:11:48,107
[SPEAKER_05]: So good times.

817
01:11:49,129 --> 01:11:49,710
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

818
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:54,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's cover some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

819
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll start with you.

820
01:11:56,572 --> 01:12:04,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Fallout 76 has some new updates coming to tie into the Fallout TV show.

821
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:15,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only will they also have an expansion that will go to Ohio, but you'll be able to run into the ghoul from the Fallout TV show.

822
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:20,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's going to be coming out here very soon.

823
01:12:20,984 --> 01:12:25,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And then along with that, we've also got...

824
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:33,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, so Marvel Cosmic Invasion, that awesome looking beat-em-up game has a demo.

825
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.

826
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:35,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cool.

827
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait to play it.

828
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:38,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely want to check that out.

829
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:40,956
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

830
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm mostly excited about this one.

831
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:56,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I said that I was trying to finish up Secret of the Spires before the movie came out, is that there is going to be new DLC for Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

832
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, I freaking love that game.

833
01:12:59,483 --> 01:13:00,905
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.

834
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:02,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.

835
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:10,960
[SPEAKER_01]: But this game, this DLC is going to happen immediately after Fire and Ash.

836
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:17,345
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to play as... This is the part that doesn't make me happy.

837
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:22,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play as my character, my side-into character that I've been playing since the beginning of the damn game.

838
01:13:22,673 --> 01:13:30,325
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead you play as Sotlek, who is the person who rescues you at the start of the game, who helps guide you out of the place.

839
01:13:31,226 --> 01:13:36,414
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had his own comic and other stuff going on.

840
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:40,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a great character, don't get me wrong, but

841
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:57,687
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to play my character.

842
01:13:58,645 --> 01:14:00,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is really cool.

843
01:14:00,588 --> 01:14:15,051
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a new collectible that's on its way out.

844
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:27,169
[SPEAKER_05]: The Definitive Visual Chronicle of Sony's World-Changing Video Game Console, marking its 30th anniversary with unprecedented access to the archive of R&D prototypes, concept sketches, and developmental models.

845
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:39,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, if you start to look through some of the pages that are out there of the book, you actually see that, and I don't even know what some of these are supposed to be, if this is actually what the PlayStation system concept might have looked like in the beginning, because that's kind of what it looks like.

846
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:41,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Those might be controller ports in the front.

847
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:45,896
[SPEAKER_05]: or if we actually have maybe some early controller prototypes.

848
01:14:46,778 --> 01:14:48,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of these have been out there.

849
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:55,110
[SPEAKER_05]: This first one looks familiar to me that maybe you've seen before, but it's kind of interesting to see these captured in photo form.

850
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:58,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what this thing we're looking at on the stream is supposed to be.

851
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:01,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the analog stick.

852
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's like the transparent.

853
01:15:04,186 --> 01:15:05,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I get it.

854
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:07,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just that taken out of... I'm like, what is this?

855
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:08,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a plunger?

856
01:15:08,733 --> 01:15:12,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, that's... It's a very different look at the analog stick.

857
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:15,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of different types of photographs and it looks really cool.

858
01:15:16,164 --> 01:15:17,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing, though.

859
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:22,233
[SPEAKER_05]: This book is going to cost you $125 for the standard edition.

860
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

861
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:48,522
[SPEAKER_05]: it's 400 pages and it does sound like this is like a collectible photography book this is the nice book that's on the coffee table or your version of it this is the nice book in a prominent place in your game room or on your bookshelf it's that kind of book this is a fancy book this is the fancy china we don't eat off it every day okay so this is you know a pretty cool book for you know gaming collectors a

862
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:51,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, this felt like the thing that would be right up your alley to me, honestly.

863
01:15:52,107 --> 01:15:54,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you could appreciate this.

864
01:15:54,912 --> 01:15:56,634
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy about it.

865
01:15:56,694 --> 01:16:00,320
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be great, but it's nothing that's in my budget for now.

866
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

867
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:02,783
[SPEAKER_05]: It is something to consider.

868
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:12,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have an even bigger budget, I should mention there is a deluxe edition, $325, limited to 1,994 copies.

869
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:14,080
[SPEAKER_05]: 1994, haha.

870
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:16,804
[SPEAKER_05]: It includes the book,

871
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:27,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Exposed Binding, A Clamshell Presentation Box, and Exclusive Prints.

872
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So something a little extra special.

873
01:16:31,105 --> 01:16:33,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what bookbinding looks like.

874
01:16:33,749 --> 01:16:35,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather have my binding protected.

875
01:16:35,631 --> 01:16:35,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

876
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very stylish choice.

877
01:16:38,996 --> 01:16:42,381
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a book you really don't take out and read on the toilet.

878
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,985

[SPEAKER_04]: No.

890
01:18:19,209 --> 01:18:19,950

891
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:25,218
[SPEAKER_01]: L-A-P-P-I-N Oh wow, I wonder if it's about the original thief.

892

[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

01:18:27,401 --> 01:18:28,182

[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

895
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:34,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game that doesn't look like anything that has to do with that.

896
01:18:34,472 --> 01:18:38,918
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like really creepy looking bunny things.

897
01:18:39,038 --> 01:18:41,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Lappin means rabbit.

898
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:49,587

01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:52,310
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Watership Down Light?

900
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:54,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

901
01:18:54,934 --> 01:19:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It says Libby, a white rabbit, goes on an adventure with Captain, Bianca, Jose, and Montblanc.

902
01:19:01,983 --> 01:19:05,748
[SPEAKER_04]: What will happen when these five rabbits go on their adventure?

903
01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:07,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... It looks cute.

904
01:19:08,773 --> 01:19:09,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rabbits.

905
01:19:11,153 --> 01:19:13,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not raving or rabid.

906
01:19:13,856 --> 01:19:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't know what to think about that.

952
01:24:39,113 --> 01:24:41,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time to bring this up.

953
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:58,274
[SPEAKER_05]: because, you know, this show was kind of conceived in this roundtable format of folks that are having, you know, dinner after a long day of gaming, whether it's DDR as we were playing back in the day or other games.

954
01:24:58,294 --> 01:25:06,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it's kind of sitting around and, you know, talking about our favorite pastime, which is playing video games and all the other nerdy things that we enjoy.

955
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:09,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that roundtable that we're all at.

956
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is probably an important point for me to let you know and bring to this roundtable that I've asked to leave this show.

957
01:25:19,883 --> 01:25:21,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

958
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:30,451
[SPEAKER_05]: After 23 years, I'm going to be leaving this show at the end of November, on November 23rd to be exact.

959
01:25:30,471 --> 01:25:35,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, there's really no easy way to state this kind of news.

960
01:25:35,178 --> 01:25:42,949
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure some of you are going to be very, very blindsided and surprised and shocked at this news.

961
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish I had a better or easier way of kind of putting it.

962
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:49,558
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is that

963
01:25:49,538 --> 01:25:54,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of said a long time ago that when things stop being fun in this space,

964
01:25:55,630 --> 01:26:22,093
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

965
01:26:22,597 --> 01:26:43,002
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's other elements in my life I guess I shouldn't say that like I'm not a fan of gaming I'm always going to be a fan of video games but maybe I don't wish to continue spending every Sunday night talking about an industry that I'm just watching continue to shoot itself in the foot and

966
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:58,864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

967
01:26:59,232 --> 01:27:00,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm breaking up the band, right?

968
01:27:00,975 --> 01:27:03,258
[SPEAKER_05]: That I'm, you know, causing this whole thing.

969
01:27:03,278 --> 01:27:03,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Yoko.

970
01:27:03,959 --> 01:27:08,646
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well... But, you know, it's... I had to make the joke.

971
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:09,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, no.

972
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:09,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should.

973
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:10,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We should make jokes.

974
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:18,240
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's one of those things where it's like, I have no easier way to put it than sometimes you recognize it's time.

975
01:27:19,582 --> 01:27:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: And after 23 and a half years, I think I recognize it's time.

976
01:27:23,348 --> 01:27:25,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean... I want to be very clear.

977
01:27:26,172 --> 01:27:28,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not doing this to...

978
01:27:29,253 --> 01:27:30,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Start an OLR 2.0.

979
01:27:31,196 --> 01:27:31,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not it.

980
01:27:32,337 --> 01:27:34,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I continue to talk about games?

981
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:35,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

982
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:37,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's kind of hard to think about right now.

983
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But not in this weekly sort of space.

984
01:27:41,851 --> 01:27:47,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I think TikTok, YouTube, somewhere in a future media type of thing.

985
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,746
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this spending multiple hours of a Sunday...

986
01:27:53,384 --> 01:28:05,773
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

987
01:28:07,188 --> 01:28:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop This, which is obviously a hard thing to bring up.

988
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, I know we talked about it, and I believe you've come to a similar conclusion, right?

989
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:23,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I've basically come to a similar conclusion as well.

990
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:32,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to be excited about a gaming industry that's just constantly in this kind of turmoil and politics and everything with...

991
01:28:32,213 --> 01:28:33,254
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

992
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:37,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a time back when we were just really excited and positive about the gaming industry.

993
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like every week they were just talking about something negative with that.

994
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:51,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas this show could continue on forever, does that really make sense to do that?

995
01:28:51,619 --> 01:28:53,963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

996
01:28:53,983 --> 01:29:01,613
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already been awarded an award for the longest running gaming podcast.

997
01:29:02,082 --> 01:29:06,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure, it could keep going, but at what point are we really enjoying it?

998
01:29:06,628 --> 01:29:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of more of going through the motions with some of that stuff.

999
01:29:11,055 --> 01:29:21,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like my energy right now is better focused on trying to grow my community with the Minecraft stuff that I've been doing.

1000
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:24,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been literally pouring all the hours and

1001
01:29:24,391 --> 01:29:48,120
[SPEAKER_04]: any additional hours I have even during work hours sometimes into to try to like get that you know more feasible and growing whereas you know certainly I love this audience I love all the community that we've you know that have come and left and during the entire time that we've been doing this but like it's just it's

1002
01:29:48,455 --> 01:30:12,893
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard it's hard to like stay positive about it and like be excited about it instead of just feel like I'm just regurgitating what I'm reading in the news am I really adding anything on top of that anymore like I've been out of the game industry for like a long time now so it doesn't feel like I even have that kind of like well here's you know the insider look at this you know type of stuff it's I don't know like how many more weeks are we gonna go where it's like hey look

1003
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,699
[SPEAKER_04]: The game industry is worse now.

1004
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:16,940
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more layoffs.

1005
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

1006
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:19,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that Microsoft story we just talked about?

1007
01:30:19,262 --> 01:30:21,624
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably more layoffs coming in 2026 as well.

1008
01:30:21,704 --> 01:30:26,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, along with that, it's just going to be more of this.

1009
01:30:26,288 --> 01:30:31,093
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there's going to be, like, indie studios, and I'm sure there's going to be games that are going to come out that we can be excited about.

1010
01:30:31,113 --> 01:30:33,875
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also be excited about that without having to talk about it every single week.

1011
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:37,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's tough.

1012
01:30:37,839 --> 01:30:42,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, in one hand, like, you want to keep it going forever, but, like,

1013
01:30:43,602 --> 01:30:49,794
[SPEAKER_04]: In the back of your mind, at least for me, it's like, am I really utilizing this time as best I can?

1014
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:51,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 45 years old.

1015
01:30:51,477 --> 01:30:56,126
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of time left.

1016
01:30:56,146 --> 01:31:01,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got like half your life, but it's the later half of your life already.

1017
01:31:01,777 --> 01:31:04,041
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I don't know.

1018
01:31:05,422 --> 01:31:11,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, Jamie, I want to turn it over to you because you have kind of taken this news... Because I'm a stubborn, spiteful bitch.

1019
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You have taken this news in a different direction, and I want to turn it over to you.

1020
01:31:15,115 --> 01:31:15,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quitting.

1021
01:31:16,857 --> 01:31:17,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep going.

1022
01:31:17,979 --> 01:31:32,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making arrangements with certain people who know who they are to birth something messy and sticky and tentacly from... It's an afterbirth.

1023
01:31:32,879 --> 01:31:33,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an afterbirth.

1024
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:38,955
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working through some details.

1025
01:31:38,975 --> 01:31:41,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying that guy's going to get his way in the afterburst coming back?

1026
01:31:41,858 --> 01:31:43,880
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy that left.

1027
01:31:46,803 --> 01:31:47,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Cage match, cage match.

1028
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:49,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind.

1029
01:31:52,209 --> 01:31:54,431
[SPEAKER_01]: We're floating names around.

1030
01:31:54,771 --> 01:31:57,434
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them I might need to get okay.

1031
01:31:57,534 --> 01:32:00,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them thrown up was OLR2ElectricBoogaloo.

1032
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:01,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

1033
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:05,755
[SPEAKER_01]: You vote for Gay Bar.

1034
01:32:06,235 --> 01:32:07,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Gay Bar is our new theme song.

1035
01:32:07,517 --> 01:32:08,038
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1036
01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is a good thing to be able to be transparent in this part of the process is that you don't know if you want to call it Orange Lounge Radio or not, if I'm not mistaken.

1037
01:32:17,972 --> 01:32:18,693
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're not.

1038
01:32:18,994 --> 01:32:19,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're not.

1039
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:21,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I was making a joke.

1040
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:27,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Then Orange Lounge Radio, as we know it, will conclude on the 23rd of November.

1041
01:32:27,586 --> 01:32:38,946
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1042
01:32:40,934 --> 01:33:00,057
[SPEAKER_05]: so far so far so there's still some things to do I mean what else the fuck am I doing on Sunday night here's the thing crocheting it's important to be transparent about this a little bit because that way Jamie is on her way to TwitchCon in two weeks she has the freedom now to talk about this because you all have heard it from us first

1043
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:13,503
[SPEAKER_05]: She has now the freedom to talk about this with whoever she wants and whatever potential collaborators there might be in the future and so forth and figure out what those next steps are going to look like before 23rd November, which is when that will be episode 1070.

1044
01:33:13,904 --> 01:33:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about episode 1069, but I didn't want to base it on numerology.

1045
01:33:18,633 --> 01:33:22,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to base it on this is the day and that's it.

1046
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:38,818
[SPEAKER_05]: that's an excellent question Mike Deft Mike Deft says I think the other question is what will Rob's involvement in VOG be I do still plan to be around with VOG I just think what my contribution is to VOG looks very different than what it does today

1047
01:33:38,798 --> 01:33:43,346
[SPEAKER_05]: My gut, I think, honestly, you know what I'm doing is I'm giving myself a vacation.

1048
01:33:44,187 --> 01:33:50,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think maybe next year, I might start to think about that roundtable concept that's kind of been on again, off again.

1049
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I sort of see a future because I'm going to tell you the most important part of that roundtable concept, they were flexible.

1050
01:33:58,812 --> 01:34:03,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1051
01:34:05,799 --> 01:34:25,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1052
01:34:25,357 --> 01:34:40,108
[SPEAKER_05]: is part of it I want to take more long weekend trips yes is part of it there are things that happen on Sundays I have not done in 20 years yes is part of it um that um damn I lost my train of thought um

1053
01:34:40,662 --> 01:34:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: is part of it.

1054
01:34:41,303 --> 01:34:46,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the fact that live hosting has really picked up for me since COVID.

1055
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:50,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have had to say no to gigs on Sunday night because of this show.

1056
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:53,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something that now will be opened up for me.

1057
01:34:53,033 --> 01:34:57,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a part of my life that I have really enjoyed exploring and being a part of.

1058
01:34:57,477 --> 01:35:10,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, that is all factoring into it too, is that this allows me to potentially pick up other conventions or other shows on Sunday night, like live shows, not internet podcasts and things like that.

1059
01:35:10,649 --> 01:35:14,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Short answer, Deft, I will still be involved with VOG.

1060
01:35:15,095 --> 01:35:17,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing we have said tonight affects Bobby Blackwolf.

1061
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:21,403
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for him to talk about when he's ready.

1062
01:35:22,205 --> 01:35:25,950
[SPEAKER_05]: If his show goes longer or what he's going to do.

1063
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:27,712
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Bobby's thing.

1064
01:35:28,413 --> 01:35:31,978
[SPEAKER_05]: He is aware of this, except I don't think he knew we were going to do it tonight.

1065
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:33,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is what it is.

1066
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will still continue to be a VOG.

1067
01:35:38,847 --> 01:36:02,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

1068
01:36:04,396 --> 01:36:06,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck to Jamie and her team with that.

1069
01:36:06,362 --> 01:36:15,412
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it is cool that you're going to keep it going, especially for the folks that are here on Sundays and have been a part of this little family for so long.

1070
01:36:15,432 --> 01:36:17,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad there can be something.

1071
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, DarkSakura!

1072
01:36:39,985 --> 01:37:02,837
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

1073
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:29,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggested earlier that we have this out now because I'd like to hear what people have to say if we don't get spam email that is so I want to give people a week to process while we're fresh here to say things and then before I go to TwitchCon

1074
01:37:29,429 --> 01:37:34,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to rule out either, but I want to be very careful how I walk this line.

1075
01:37:34,714 --> 01:37:39,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to rule out the potential that the three of us can reunite for other things.

1076
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:45,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Preserving the friendship with Loki and Jamie is the most important thing to me out of all of this, of course.

1077
01:37:45,905 --> 01:37:46,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it was ever at risk.

1078
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:49,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still going to get memes from me all the time?

1079
01:37:49,088 --> 01:37:59,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and not that any of that was ever at risk, but I'm just saying that I do see a situation where the three of us can still come together once in a while to talk about some big things.

1080
01:37:59,298 --> 01:38:26,655
[SPEAKER_05]: and but is that going to be every week no is that going to be you know it's spontaneous as we're able to make it happen sure you know like if Jamie's willing amongst her new project as well and Loki amongst everything he's working on and so forth like absolutely that's something so I but I don't also don't want to give false hope you know that's that's why I'm saying it's a tricky line right I don't want to be like but it's not really over because we'll still get together once in a

1081
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:30,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Ones Radio, as you know it, is going to be done on November 23rd.

1082
01:38:31,777 --> 01:38:33,760
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully the future won't be so bad.

1083
01:38:34,281 --> 01:38:34,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1084
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be okay, right?

1085
01:38:38,006 --> 01:38:41,350
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob made a good point earlier about all of us developing our other things.

1086
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:44,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just another podcast.

1087
01:38:44,574 --> 01:38:47,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been floating another podcast idea for a while.

1088
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a Dead by Daylight machinima kind of thing.

1089
01:38:52,345 --> 01:38:55,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also trying to grow my own channel.

1090
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1091
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy streaming.

1092
01:39:00,244 --> 01:39:02,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy having people there to interact with.

1093
01:39:02,226 --> 01:39:03,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love one day to be partner.

1094
01:39:04,349 --> 01:39:06,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that would just be absolutely tremendous.

1095
01:39:07,473 --> 01:39:19,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been doing this every Sunday, and I like being out there and loud and talking shit.

1096
01:39:20,315 --> 01:39:34,074
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that there is still an opportunity to give the alternative view on what happens not just in gaming but I mean geek culture in general.

1097
01:39:34,595 --> 01:39:47,233
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a big opportunity for that to specifically speak on how they all interact together and also to speak out against the injustices going on in the world because they're affecting all of us.

1098
01:39:47,213 --> 01:39:57,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we like video games and we might be into anime and we might like Doctor Who or watching these shows does not mean we do not have a serious opinion.

1099
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:01,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to keep that going.

1100
01:40:01,283 --> 01:40:03,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rinmari, I adore you and...

1101
01:40:04,392 --> 01:40:08,458
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, you came over and you've been through a lot with us.

1102
01:40:08,538 --> 01:40:09,840
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have been through some shit.

1103
01:40:10,161 --> 01:40:23,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I also kind of like looking at this as sort of an evolution and there was a point, you know, there's a couple of points really when OLR evolved, you know, we were a show about Bomani exclusively and we sort of hit a reset button at one point with that.

1104
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,623
[SPEAKER_05]: to be really about games.

1105
01:40:25,663 --> 01:40:31,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was also part of this whole merging podcasting with what we were doing all the way back on Live 365 and all that.

1106
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: This show has been through a few changes.

1107
01:40:34,234 --> 01:40:40,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love what you're saying there, Jamie, about maybe really looking at the voice of geeks being about geeks now.

1108
01:40:40,903 --> 01:40:45,148
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're bringing to this being about...

1109
01:40:45,128 --> 01:41:04,774
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else that's not just video games sure that's part of it but everything else as well and based on who I am aware you're talking to I think you're talking to all the right people for that sort of project so it sounds very exciting so sorry to be one of those people was the first person I reached out to do not say who you are

1110
01:41:04,754 --> 01:41:09,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so there's... Yeah, some more to come on that.

1111
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:19,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to call out the chat comment, and actually this has been raised a couple times, but TravisC78 in chat says, sucks to hear, but much respect for calling on your own terms.

1112
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:23,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of you have actually used that, your own terms, going on your own terms.

1113
01:41:24,134 --> 01:41:31,622
[SPEAKER_05]: That is absolutely a huge part of this decision, is wanting to do this...

1114
01:41:31,602 --> 01:41:33,745
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's something that's under our control.

1115
01:41:33,765 --> 01:41:35,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we've had scares in the past.

1116
01:41:36,489 --> 01:41:39,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it might have been something that wasn't part of our control.

1117
01:41:41,857 --> 01:41:45,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to be too dark, but I had a near-death experience when I was 29.

1118
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:47,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And this show was on at that time.

1119
01:41:47,805 --> 01:41:51,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there have been some very sombering moments that make us go, shit.

1120
01:41:51,951 --> 01:41:53,213
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have gotten married.

1121
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:54,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very true.

1122
01:41:55,256 --> 01:41:56,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

1123
01:41:57,138 --> 01:41:57,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1124
01:41:58,602 --> 01:41:59,424
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1125
01:41:59,444 --> 01:42:00,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big news.

1126
01:42:00,707 --> 01:42:06,579
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there was not a lot of warning about that.

1127
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:15,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think those of you that are here, because I do feel like it is possible that some people's ears are going to perk up about a

1128
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:23,128
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 plus long year running podcast deciding to close its doors to open different doors somewhere else.

1129
01:42:24,469 --> 01:42:32,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But we wanted you all that are here week after week and on the podcast feed to be able to hear this from us first.

1130
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:40,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to say for the people who noticed I had been really out of sorts over the last few weeks, this is why.

1131
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:50,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I couldn't say anything, but this is... I'm in the place of numbness right now.

1132
01:42:51,906 --> 01:42:56,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my brain just sort of goes right over it and just starts thinking about future things.

1133
01:42:57,213 --> 01:42:59,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1134
01:43:00,138 --> 01:43:02,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm... I'm okay.

1135
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:02,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1136
01:43:06,407 --> 01:43:07,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1137
01:43:07,503 --> 01:43:09,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the okayest pig main on Twitch right now.

1138
01:43:09,828 --> 01:43:10,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

1139
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:16,584
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as what the future shows look like, it's business as usual through the 23rd of November.

1140
01:43:16,604 --> 01:43:18,829
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a show I'm missing.

1141
01:43:19,079 --> 01:43:22,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will be dark that night, October 26th.

1142
01:43:23,347 --> 01:43:24,308
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no show.

1143
01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:27,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a work-based situation that I cannot control.

1144
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:31,642
[SPEAKER_05]: This or not this, I would not be here October 26th.

1145
01:43:32,002 --> 01:43:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie will not be here the week before due to TwitchCon, but otherwise it's business as usual.

1146
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as the last show goes, we're not ones to pull a lot of stunts.

1147
01:43:45,303 --> 01:43:51,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can expect it will be as you've come to expect right up until the very end.

1148
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:55,084
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm open to all ideas.

1149
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,467
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few weeks to figure it out.

1150
01:43:59,213 --> 01:43:59,594
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1151
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:02,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the dollar, Fifth Dream.

1152
01:44:02,621 --> 01:44:02,721
Yeah.

1153
01:44:03,342 --> 01:44:32,185
[SPEAKER_05]: um with that um I know that's a heavy beast of information but you know hopefully everybody has some time to process we can talk about a little more next week if you want um and you know through these last few weeks I imagine we may see a few uh faces from the past pulling through one more time um and uh yeah um Matt I'll check in quickly see if there's any last minute stories but otherwise I think that's probably a good note for us to just exit stage right on um

1154
01:44:33,008 --> 01:44:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1155
01:44:34,029 --> 01:44:38,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Then why do I go around and say, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1156
01:44:38,555 --> 01:44:41,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your support over the last few years.

1157
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually had a spiel here at the end.

1158
01:44:43,822 --> 01:44:48,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that spiel is going to change a little bit here towards the end and just say- So long and thanks for all the fish.

1159
01:44:48,788 --> 01:44:54,856
[SPEAKER_05]: No, truly, thank you for all your support over these last 23 and a half years and over a thousand episodes.

1160
01:44:55,097 --> 01:44:56,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You all have kept us going.

1161
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:57,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I

1162
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:58,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

1163
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:05,473
[SPEAKER_05]: When I thought there was no gas in the tank, you all were the reasons the show still kept going as long as it has.

1164
01:45:06,014 --> 01:45:09,960
[SPEAKER_05]: This world record run was not achievable without you all.

1165
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for your support over the years.

1166
01:45:12,043 --> 01:45:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It means everything to us.

1167
01:45:13,626 --> 01:45:18,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be here at VOG Network every Sunday night throughout the 23rd of November, minus that one exception I talked about.

1168
01:45:19,395 --> 01:45:20,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all so much.

1169
01:45:20,818 --> 01:45:21,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope to see you.

1170
01:45:21,519 --> 01:45:24,784
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope you'll see this out to the bitter end with us.

1171
01:45:24,764 --> 01:45:27,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, DarkSakura, your final thought.

1172
01:45:28,732 --> 01:45:30,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the end's going to be bitter.

1173
01:45:31,918 --> 01:45:32,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

1174
01:45:32,599 --> 01:45:34,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be tart.

1175
01:45:35,225 --> 01:45:43,360
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be waffles involved and maybe some booze and a lot of saying fuck.

1176
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:43,681
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

1177
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:44,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered Malort.

1178
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:45,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Pray for me.

1179
01:45:45,725 --> 01:45:46,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1180
01:45:46,186 --> 01:45:47,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had Malort?

1181
01:45:48,001 --> 01:45:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: No, apparently it tastes like stomach acid and a million years of regret.

1182
01:45:54,575 --> 01:46:00,787
[SPEAKER_05]: The Chicago Ingress players make it a big fucking deal at all the events that if you haven't been malorted, you've got to.

1183
01:46:00,807 --> 01:46:02,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've had my share of malort.

1184
01:46:02,491 --> 01:46:03,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing.

1185
01:46:03,894 --> 01:46:05,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saving it for something.

1186
01:46:05,537 --> 01:46:07,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Beverly of alcohol.

1187
01:46:09,305 --> 01:46:09,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1188
01:46:10,563 --> 01:46:11,204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've got.

1189
01:46:11,624 --> 01:46:14,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm saving it for something post-TwitchCon.

1190
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1191
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1192
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:16,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

1193
01:46:16,852 --> 01:46:17,633
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1194
01:46:17,993 --> 01:46:19,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're streaming tonight, we'll see you in a little bit then.

1195
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:20,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

1196
01:46:20,116 --> 01:46:20,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

1197
01:46:20,817 --> 01:46:21,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Pallia night.

1198
01:46:21,678 --> 01:46:25,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured we need some Pallia tonight instead of the Debbies.

1199
01:46:25,704 --> 01:46:29,469
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go for cozy.

1200
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:32,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might cry in my stream.

1201
01:46:32,974 --> 01:46:33,314
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

1202
01:46:34,356 --> 01:46:34,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1203
01:46:34,796 --> 01:46:36,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean has an excellent question.

1204
01:46:36,178 --> 01:46:39,523
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen to the voiceover guy in the beginning of the show?

1205
01:46:40,786 --> 01:46:42,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

1206
01:46:42,729 --> 01:46:49,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason would love for you to... Wherever there is voiceover work needed... Do you want to be our voiceover guy?

1207
01:46:51,462 --> 01:46:55,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say if ever I have voiceover needs, Jason will still be the first guy I call.

1208
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:57,792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my quick answer to that question.

1209
01:46:57,892 --> 01:47:05,443
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will save some of this for when we're ready to be done on the final night.

1210
01:47:05,423 --> 01:47:32,595
[SPEAKER_05]: you wouldn't have had this show for a thousand of these 1064 episodes if it wasn't for Jason and I know he's not visible on this show as much there was a stretch there where we had a lot of Jason on this show which was great but trust you may not hear him outside those voiceovers at the beginning and the end there would be no OLR if it wasn't for Jason this entire time so one of the biggest thank yous in the room goes to VXJasonXV so

1211
01:47:33,065 --> 01:47:56,676
[SPEAKER_05]: he's got a we gave him a spoon so he can dig his way out of the basement, fifth stream fifth stream said let him out of the basement before you go alright Jamie, go start your stream before we get out too much of the final final stuff when we're not ready yet, bye alright, Loki, we're going to you your final thought tonight speaking of bittersweet Tron Ares week

1212
01:48:01,617 --> 01:48:30,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next week, goodnight.

1213
01:48:32,887 --> 01:48:35,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1214
01:48:37,534 --> 01:48:40,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1215
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:51,434
