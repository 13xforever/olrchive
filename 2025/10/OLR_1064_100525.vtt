WEBVTT

00:09.835 --> 00:17.163
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had taken that economics class in high school, I might be able to understand how to compare sales like a single game in contrast to subscription services like Game Pass.

00:17.443 --> 00:27.815
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft reportedly lost $300 million in sales putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass Day 1, which, duh, anyone that wants to be in the Microsoft ecosystem and has already subscribed to Game Pass gets to play it at no additional cost.

00:27.835 --> 00:29.336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shrugging furiously right now.

00:29.557 --> 00:35.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about Microsoft's headlines and the rest of the week's gaming news.

00:35.043 --> 00:37.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting right now on the show, wherever Gamer has a voice...

00:39.012 --> 00:45.499
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:45.659 --> 00:53.767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Orange Lounge Radio Live, again, again, again, episode number 1064 for tonight, October the 5th of 2025.

00:54.388 --> 01:00.153
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to talk about video game news, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and once in a while, a really good new recipe.

01:00.534 --> 01:05.078
[SPEAKER_05]: With myself, Rob Roberts, and your co-host, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:06.019 --> 01:08.682
[SPEAKER_01]: The only recipes I hear of is a recipe for disaster.

01:10.180 --> 01:37.352
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37.602 --> 01:38.969
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Mega Bonk.

01:39.311 --> 01:39.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Bonk.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing to do with Bonk from the TurboGrafx era.

01:43.559 --> 01:44.741
[SPEAKER_04]: No, nothing to do with that.

01:44.901 --> 01:47.705
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a funny story about this.

01:47.725 --> 01:55.537
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a guy who I watch on YouTube named Danny, who is a game developer in Unity.

01:55.557 --> 01:58.642
[SPEAKER_04]: He had one game that he was trying to push for a while called Carlson.

01:58.962 --> 02:02.969
[SPEAKER_04]: He also made some free-to-play games.

02:03.029 --> 02:06.634
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Crab Game was one that was really popular for a while.

02:06.654 --> 02:07.856
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a Squid Game type thing.

02:08.657 --> 02:12.503
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's disappeared off the face of the earth for the longest time.

02:12.702 --> 02:20.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Ironically, this game comes out and, you know, it does really well and it's sort of similar to his style.

02:20.939 --> 02:25.048
[SPEAKER_04]: And wouldn't you know it, the developer's name is his name backwards.

02:25.068 --> 02:27.673
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm guessing it's the same person.

02:29.155 --> 02:31.159
[SPEAKER_05]: because that would be quite the coincidence.

02:31.279 --> 02:31.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

02:32.081 --> 02:32.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

02:32.862 --> 02:33.223
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:33.323 --> 02:35.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you played this game or are you just hearing the hype about it?

02:35.567 --> 02:39.154
[SPEAKER_04]: I have purchased this game and have not played this game yet.

02:39.234 --> 02:40.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Steam backlog issue.

02:40.957 --> 02:41.498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

02:41.538 --> 02:42.480
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm familiar with that one.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:43.442 --> 02:44.003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an issue.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.105
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a feature.

02:45.524 --> 02:51.269
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chat because we do tape live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 p.m.

02:51.329 --> 02:55.533
[SPEAKER_05]: Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show on Sunday nights.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.415
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can listen along live with us.

02:57.435 --> 03:04.101
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dark Tetsuya, in reference to what I was talking about with Bonk, suggesting another IP Konami's just sitting on.

03:04.581 --> 03:13.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I mean, I do feel like I haven't played it myself yet, but just judging from other people, it seems like Silent Hill F is a win.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a win in Konami's column.

03:15.511 --> 03:18.657
[SPEAKER_05]: in a series of what's been honestly good.

03:18.797 --> 03:22.965
[SPEAKER_05]: You said it was really good?

03:22.985 --> 03:33.064
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching people play it and I won't be able to until it's on GeForce Experience or if I know it works with Crossover, but from what I've seen, it's

03:33.888 --> 03:57.685
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

03:57.665 --> 04:22.778
[SPEAKER_05]: well done uh the Castlevania repackages the Metal Gear thing is probably going to be really good too Suikoden coming back and the HD collection is really good um on the arcade front you know round one is is the place to be and a lot of that is because of you know granted not just Konami music games but if but a a series that Konami definitely pioneered and is still a major player in you know so uh

04:22.758 --> 04:24.580
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta give credit to Konami.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.364
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a Konami Renaissance era, and it's great.

04:27.484 --> 04:29.127
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, kudos to them.

04:29.147 --> 04:33.713
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to see what's next, especially with, you know, Metal Gear and so forth.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, QuestBuster and Chad agree, it's a huge win for Konami.

04:36.336 --> 04:48.833
[SPEAKER_05]: The few horror streamers I managed to catch have loved Silent Hill F. And yeah, I feel like, you know, as much as we're joking about, gosh, it's frustrating that they won't release a new bonk, well, maybe the good news is, if they ever do a new bonk,

04:48.813 --> 04:51.497
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a better chance of being good than not so good.

04:51.537 --> 05:02.495
[SPEAKER_05]: The people that be and the powers that be at Konami that are making the decisions now in the 2020s seem to be in a lot better sound place than 10 years ago, 20 years ago even.

05:03.076 --> 05:04.698
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good news.

05:04.839 --> 05:05.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Good news for Konami.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to pick up Silent Hill F at some point.

05:08.164 --> 05:08.925
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably will.

05:09.005 --> 05:11.710
[SPEAKER_05]: I just picked up a couple other games first.

05:11.730 --> 05:15.175
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in that part of the year where you have to pick and choose what games you play.

05:15.155 --> 05:20.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just like you have to pick and choose what games you play, you have to pick and choose what consoles you play them on.

05:20.962 --> 05:30.153
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, uh, gonna start us off with a headline, a series of headlines, really, that has the entire gaming industry talking this week.

05:30.173 --> 05:31.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, take it away, please.

05:32.516 --> 05:40.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, yes, uh, because, you know, Microsoft clearly reading the room of the economy and how everything's kinda...

05:40.535 --> 05:41.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the shitter.

05:41.916 --> 05:45.701
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, hey, you know what would be a good thing to do about this time?

05:45.721 --> 05:47.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's raise some more prices.

05:47.723 --> 05:48.864
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they did that.

05:48.944 --> 05:52.868
[SPEAKER_04]: They raised the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50%.

05:52.988 --> 05:56.392
[SPEAKER_04]: So it went from $20 a month to $30.

05:56.492 --> 05:58.034
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, don't worry.

05:58.054 --> 06:09.546
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get some extra features that you may or may not want, including some Ubisoft back catalog games and Fortnite Game Passes or something.

06:10.387 --> 06:12.970
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, I guess.

06:14.191 --> 06:15.453
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so they did all that.

06:15.493 --> 06:19.618
[SPEAKER_04]: They also added streaming, though, to some of the lower tiers as well.

06:19.738 --> 06:24.103
[SPEAKER_04]: But for most people, it's like, nope, sorry.

06:24.123 --> 06:26.626
[SPEAKER_04]: $360 a year for Game Pass?

06:27.147 --> 06:27.547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.

06:29.169 --> 06:30.050
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was one of those people.

06:30.070 --> 06:33.975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really play Game Pass enough as is.

06:33.995 --> 06:40.022
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of just let it go month to month, and maybe my son will play stuff off of it.

06:40.222 --> 06:44.328
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, $30 a month is not something I can just let idly sit there.

06:44.669 --> 06:47.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with all of their games right now.

06:47.573 --> 06:52.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly, I would be picking those up on PC if I'm going to play anything.

06:52.560 --> 07:00.251
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, really the only thing I'm holding onto on my Xbox Series X right now is Grand Theft Auto 6.

07:00.732 --> 07:02.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Only because it's not on PC at launch.

07:02.795 --> 07:06.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, if it was on PC at launch, I'd get it on PC.

07:06.661 --> 07:07.562
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

07:07.863 --> 07:11.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's just, it's really annoying that they're doing that.

07:11.831 --> 07:24.657
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention that on top of all that, they kind of made these assertions back, you know, when this whole, you know, the FTC was looking into them stuff and, you know, we were like, all those, that FTC, what are they doing and stuff, you know, but like...

07:25.902 --> 07:46.408
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:46.388 --> 07:57.673
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, Call of Duty Points, which were for cosmetics in the Call of Duty series, they are now no longer getting that discount that you used to have.

07:57.914 --> 08:02.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're changing the way that discounts work on other...

08:03.179 --> 08:28.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Passes Game Passes

08:28.643 --> 08:48.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty Black Ops 6

08:49.788 --> 09:14.530
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that lost revenue which I mean like let's hold the phone here for a second so yeah it's lost revenue in the sense that you didn't sell your $80 game or whatever but at the same time you're really whoring those Microsoft points and the Call of Duty points and whatever other points I would also how many of those downloads were people that were actually going to buy the game

09:14.577 --> 09:16.441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

09:17.523 --> 09:22.634
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

09:24.157 --> 09:26.883
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that there's some of that stuff.

09:26.943 --> 09:30.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you may have lost on some of the sales, but

09:31.081 --> 09:36.691
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really a loss in the end if you're making that stuff up in the microtransactions and all that type of stuff?

09:37.112 --> 09:41.419
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that's a fair comparison, but whatever.

09:41.940 --> 09:49.393
[SPEAKER_04]: And then along with this, being this backlash is so big and the fact that these consoles are getting so expensive.

09:49.373 --> 09:51.697
[SPEAKER_04]: and that retailers are stopping.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Some retailers are not carrying the Xbox consoles anymore.

09:56.364 --> 10:04.156
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, next-gen Xbox plans might be up in the air if more retailers are not selling the consoles.

10:04.857 --> 10:15.373
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might be something for Microsoft to think about that they may just transition into a third-party game publisher instead and not put out their own consoles.

10:15.974 --> 10:17.997
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe they do put their consoles out and...

10:17.977 --> 10:42.533
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

10:42.513 --> 10:42.914
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

10:43.514 --> 10:49.302
[SPEAKER_05]: To backtrack a little bit over the large amount of news you just dropped there, you know, about the price going up to $30.

10:49.782 --> 10:55.549
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this just shows a poor lack of planning on Microsoft's part.

10:55.950 --> 10:56.971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite frankly what it is.

10:57.171 --> 11:04.681
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from a consumer perspective, the choice to give away games on Game Pass day one, from a consumer perspective, was great.

11:05.101 --> 11:07.665
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure really drove a lot of signups for Game Pass.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.567
[SPEAKER_05]: But from a business perspective,

11:09.547 --> 11:30.964
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:30.944 --> 11:44.406
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly believe that if there had been a little more foresight and a little better planning in this regard, now granted, Microsoft could never have foresaw this tariff, well, they maybe could have a little bit, but I'm going to give them a pass, okay?

11:45.067 --> 11:52.058
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, none of us were prepared for the speed and, you know, at which all this bullshit's taking place right now.

11:52.038 --> 11:54.342
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth.

11:54.683 --> 12:06.724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not even considering any of that other stuff and what I'm saying, but the increased price of the consoles does play into the whole the truth is in the perception.

12:07.265 --> 12:08.427
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that

12:08.407 --> 12:34.060
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I, I,

12:34.040 --> 12:37.004
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, otherwise, they couldn't have the foresight for that.

12:37.064 --> 12:40.389
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Game Pass thing, I feel like they could have had the foresight for.

12:40.910 --> 12:49.343
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they really should have done, and y'all are going to hate me for saying this, but this would have been a better way to get the Band-Aid off than what they're doing now.

12:49.363 --> 12:56.353
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I know most of you would prefer that the Band-Aid just get ripped right off, but in most cases, it isn't always the best business plan.

12:56.373 --> 13:01.060
[SPEAKER_05]: Case in point, what we're hearing about the cancellations shutting down the website, it's so many of them.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.007
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like what happened with Disney Plus over a completely different situation.

13:06.289 --> 13:16.106
[SPEAKER_05]: What Microsoft could have done was six months ago announce, this was an experimental plan for us to deliver the day one games on Game Pass.

13:16.507 --> 13:19.572
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to be scaling that back from the service this holiday.

13:19.552 --> 13:39.045
[SPEAKER_05]: instead, please look forward to these other types of incentives, blah, blah, blah, blah or maybe try to sweeten the pot at that point with the Fortnite Battle Pass or what I think ought to be a WoW subscription, but I'm a niche gamer, fine, but maybe Blizzard Credit of other sort, you know, Blizzard Bucks or whatever they want to do, you know, sweeten the pot that way, and then

13:39.025 --> 13:48.118
[SPEAKER_05]: 6 months later say, now we're coming out with a brand new tier of Game Pass that's Game Pass Ultra Femininominon.

13:48.138 --> 13:55.269
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Game Pass Femininominon tier that comes out with all the extra stuff in it and the day one and stuff.

13:55.309 --> 13:58.353
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that you can get for this hot new deal right now.

13:58.474 --> 14:07.547
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like what we're seeing now is more reactionary to what was bad business planning than what could have been a better business strategy from the beginning.

14:07.527 --> 14:30.683
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:30.663 --> 14:57.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt that there was a lot of good stuff that a couple years ago Phil Spencer was doing ever since this Microsoft acquisition I feel like it's been botched decision after botched decision I don't see how he stays at the top of the company much longer especially after if these Game Pass subscriptions keep falling the way they are I'm sorry as a person to say that I don't take delight in it but at the same time

14:57.038 --> 15:04.517
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

15:05.594 --> 15:10.701
[SPEAKER_05]: This is bad business on Microsoft.

15:10.721 --> 15:11.743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

15:11.763 --> 15:14.246
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put excuses.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.471
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put justifications, I guess, if you're still in Microsoft.

15:17.751 --> 15:21.777
[SPEAKER_05]: You can say, well, they have to squeeze every last drop of juice out of their existing consumer.

15:22.678 --> 15:27.085
[SPEAKER_05]: I can sit here and say, no matter what way you slice it, it's bad business.

15:27.485 --> 15:35.196
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft is not in a position in the gaming space to be able to get away with making many more bad decisions, if any at all.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.021
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.384
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this decision is going to harm Microsoft.

15:39.684 --> 16:02.428
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this, coupled with the tariff thing, is ironically going to send a somewhat more American-based company out of the gaming space and make way for its competitors in a foreign country, which is the exact opposite of what our Fuhrer-in-Chief thought he was going to be doing with these tariffs.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.571
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean, think?

16:08.116 --> 16:11.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Which part?

16:11.359 --> 16:14.362
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there's a functional brain left.

16:14.402 --> 16:14.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no.

16:14.643 --> 16:15.584
[SPEAKER_05]: There's clearly not.

16:15.604 --> 16:16.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially now.

16:16.525 --> 16:21.449
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, did you see that bro-level military address?

16:21.610 --> 16:27.636
[SPEAKER_05]: I have mercifully been gone all weekend, and the only thing I listened to, because I drove to L.A.

16:27.676 --> 16:32.841
[SPEAKER_05]: and back by myself, and the only thing I had to pass the time was, oh...

16:32.821 --> 16:35.143
[SPEAKER_05]: There's audiobooks available.

16:35.483 --> 16:41.329
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a certain new audiobook from a person I wish would be the president right now that is out.

16:41.449 --> 16:44.191
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to listen to this for the next nine hours.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.593
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pleasant.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you, it was embarrassing.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.597
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, E3VL says it right.

16:50.637 --> 16:51.938
[SPEAKER_01]: No one clapped at the end.

16:52.159 --> 16:53.260
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dead silence.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.122
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody hated that.

16:56.142 --> 16:57.043
[SPEAKER_05]: No cheering from the press box.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody disliked that.

16:58.064 --> 16:59.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody disliked that.

16:59.565 --> 17:00.246
Yeah.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.946
[SPEAKER_01]: There was literally nothing.

17:04.607 --> 17:05.127
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.

17:05.147 --> 17:07.510
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dead silent.

17:07.530 --> 17:11.974
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, and you can say, keep politics out of gaming.

17:12.034 --> 17:14.617
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your politics out of my gaming show.

17:14.677 --> 17:19.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep your politics out of... It hasn't stopped politics from getting into our gaming.

17:19.141 --> 17:20.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

17:20.783 --> 17:21.384
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the winner.

17:21.424 --> 17:22.325
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a prize.

17:22.345 --> 17:22.825
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

17:23.085 --> 17:23.566
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

17:24.046 --> 17:26.689
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft is...

17:26.669 --> 17:38.648
[SPEAKER_05]: As reported by industry media, Microsoft is about to be pushed out of the retail space.

17:40.311 --> 17:42.494
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do we have to thank for that?

17:42.514 --> 17:47.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad business decisions and decisions where their hand was forced out of their control.

17:47.722 --> 17:49.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to back.

17:49.826 --> 17:51.889
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

17:51.909 --> 17:53.892
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't keep politics out of gaming.

17:55.154 --> 18:02.024
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to some of you that it took this long to figure that out.

18:02.044 --> 18:03.926
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

18:04.106 --> 18:04.968
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did I miss?

18:06.470 --> 18:07.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, anything you want to add?

18:12.018 --> 18:15.582
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just... I feel sick to my stomach.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.226
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the whole thing.

18:18.246 --> 18:19.368
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel sick to my stomach.

18:21.651 --> 18:23.153
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has been...

18:23.723 --> 18:32.142
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot has been just really... I can't even... I don't even know what the even that I can't do is.

18:32.162 --> 18:34.447
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that bad.

18:34.467 --> 18:35.509
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank God I have a Mac.

18:37.072 --> 18:43.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I understand that perspective, but also, like, you know, there's...

18:43.855 --> 18:49.905
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of Microsoft stuff is going to take a while to show up there too You don't bother with Game Pass on Mac, right?

18:50.526 --> 18:58.038
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no Do I really want to play games at the lowest quality possible on my Mac Studio?

18:59.661 --> 19:09.897
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I can run all this stuff by enabling some of my extra metal capabilities Running it through Crossover and have it look freaking perfect Or play it through GeForce

19:11.058 --> 19:18.609
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, oh, and I guess I never said where I'm at personally with my own thing because I've been an Xbox gold or whatever the fuck they've called it over the years.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.312
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been at that level of Xbox.

19:20.372 --> 19:23.116
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have a 20-year badge, 19-year, 20-year badge.

19:23.136 --> 19:25.159
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a 20-year badge, I'm pretty sure, on my account.

19:25.179 --> 19:32.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I got into Xbox in part because of this show and in part to a wedding I went to where they played Halo.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.333
[SPEAKER_05]: And I loved Halo so much I bought an Xbox.

19:34.594 --> 19:38.179
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got on Xbox Live because I wanted the DLC for DDR Ultramix.

19:38.159 --> 19:40.424
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what got me into Xbox and Xbox Live.

19:40.664 --> 19:43.490
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have carried it consistently this entire time.

19:43.510 --> 19:46.577
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is now where I'm sitting going, is this the end?

19:46.597 --> 19:47.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this might be the end.

19:48.000 --> 19:58.682
[SPEAKER_05]: And to credit to what Bobby was saying earlier in chat, it was a while ago in chat, but Bobby had suggested for Loki just get Essential when Grand Theft Auto 6 comes out if you want to play it online.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.043
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, exactly.

20:01.426 --> 20:03.691
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a part of me that's like, do I downgrade?

20:04.112 --> 20:10.326
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also kind of at this point where I'm like, honestly, maybe I'll just buy Forza Horizon on PlayStation.

20:11.572 --> 20:20.869
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think maybe I'm just going to cut Microsoft loose so I'm only paying one of these fees because I'm doing most of my gaming on PC these days.

20:20.889 --> 20:33.833
[SPEAKER_05]: I play a little bit on the Switch and I play a little bit on PlayStation and I know we have our Xbox fans in the house and I hope you hear me when I say I'm not being an Xbox hater but I feel like Microsoft's forcing me to make a choice.

20:34.606 --> 20:37.510
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm kind of at this... To you in particular.

20:38.031 --> 20:41.896
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, we know that Rob guy is playing all of our stuff.

20:42.497 --> 20:46.542
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna... We're doing all this because of Rob, really.

20:46.562 --> 20:47.423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it's fair.

20:48.985 --> 20:53.672
[SPEAKER_05]: No one could have predicted shooting yourself in the foot this hard, though, to be fair.

20:55.294 --> 21:03.685
[SPEAKER_05]: Well... Well... I guess you could say the government did in the whole thing, but...

21:04.373 --> 21:33.132
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a whole other argument there about what needed to be eliminated from the gaming industry the saddest part of that whole thing was that Bobby Kotek got a golden parachute getting separated from and that's the most fucked up thing about capitalism in America that these executives walk away with millions and you walk away with bigger bills there's gonna come a time where people are finally gonna figure it out

21:33.230 --> 21:34.692
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're not going to take it anymore.

21:36.034 --> 21:43.504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, I was actually telling Dan that just earlier today in general about stuff and then we started going, can you hear the people sing?

21:44.746 --> 21:53.918
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, we have to rely, there will come a time, there will come a time when people think for themselves instead of reading it online.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.041
[SPEAKER_05]: Grok told me this.

21:57.042 --> 22:00.587
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember when we went to see Greg Proops?

22:01.107 --> 22:02.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that was a fun show.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.290
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a great guy.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.052
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what my question to him was?

22:05.473 --> 22:07.795
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely not after all these years, but I'm sure you do.

22:07.856 --> 22:18.008
[SPEAKER_01]: How far away are we from an American cover of the French Revolution?

22:18.028 --> 22:19.410
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, oh, it's going to happen.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.474
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he signed my paper and said it was cool.

22:22.910 --> 22:24.032
[SPEAKER_05]: You should find that episode.

22:24.052 --> 22:24.934
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me his note sheet.

22:25.174 --> 22:26.116
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it as framed.

22:26.236 --> 22:28.881
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, well, I'm sure the episode you have somewhere.

22:28.921 --> 22:30.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the episode.

22:30.645 --> 22:31.587
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to find it.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.711
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he still podcasts.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.975
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a pretty successful show for a long time.

22:36.416 --> 22:44.952
[SPEAKER_05]: If Greg still podcasts, you should email him and say, hey, I just wanted to revisit this question.

22:44.932 --> 22:49.698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just circling back per my last email.

22:50.359 --> 22:54.144
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to see if the Smartest Man in the World podcast is still going.

22:54.164 --> 22:54.905
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

22:54.925 --> 22:55.225
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

22:55.946 --> 22:58.870
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much about baseball from him.

23:01.273 --> 23:01.733
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

23:03.095 --> 23:04.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

23:04.336 --> 23:06.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about happy things like your gaming week.

23:06.299 --> 23:07.080
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

23:07.340 --> 23:08.762
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

23:09.755 --> 23:14.163
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I played, uh, of course, Dead by Daylight.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.569
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh yeah, the last episode was in 2010.

23:17.709 --> 23:18.951
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found out.

23:19.673 --> 23:20.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that's a bummer.

23:20.454 --> 23:20.735
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

23:21.816 --> 23:24.962
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, I, uh...

23:25.583 --> 23:27.467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I played Dead by Daylight.

23:28.950 --> 23:34.703
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to do the DBD Day challenges to get all the goodies and whatnot.

23:35.545 --> 23:42.259
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shay and I were playing Survivor and we met two people who were really lovely and were trying to adapt their jills.

23:42.661 --> 23:44.084
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were doing Adepts together.

23:44.745 --> 23:52.279
[SPEAKER_01]: So we helped them get their Jill Adept, and then we played with them until we got them their Leon, Chris, Carlos Adept.

23:52.299 --> 23:55.285
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Shay went on to play with them, and they got a few more.

23:56.347 --> 23:59.052
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like doing stuff like that, helping people out.

24:00.074 --> 24:02.659
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played some Killer.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.344
[SPEAKER_01]: That was fun, kind of.

24:06.337 --> 24:08.460
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played more of Avatar.

24:08.500 --> 24:14.949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing The Secret of the Spires, which is, to me, a lot more fun than the last DLC.

24:15.009 --> 24:20.556
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get that finished before a certain movie comes out.

24:22.259 --> 24:24.381
[SPEAKER_01]: And played some Palia.

24:25.082 --> 24:30.690
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally have bought yet another property, and I'm now trying to save up enough money to put stuff on it.

24:31.025 --> 24:57.690
[SPEAKER_01]: um um played some Suica game uh some Bellatro um oh yeah and uh uh Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight or Symphony of the Night for Saturn played a good bit of that got to the Reverse Castle good times all right Loki we'll go to you how was your gaming week

24:57.940 --> 25:26.412
[SPEAKER_04]: I just played Minecraft stuff so we had a there was CubeCon this weekend which is an in-game Minecraft convention so went and explored that for a bit it's still going to be up for the next week if you haven't gotten a chance to check it out or want to you can do that our SMP has a booth there as well and there's like mini games and stuff I don't know so we did that and we're just working on stuff in-game as well put out a video

25:26.695 --> 25:31.069
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm setting up a build contest right now and yeah, that's pretty much it.

25:31.994 --> 25:58.069
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome um my gaming week was interesting um i'm still continuing my adventures in final fantasy 11 i finally hit uh level 50 which means i need to do my limit break but i'm playing on that server that has the the xp gains out the wazoo so there's that i've also been playing the very aptly timed uh re-release remaster of final fantasy tactics i played a little bit of that on playstation this week before i went out of town this weekend and um

25:58.049 --> 26:25.120
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's it's you can choose if you want to play the remake version or the original version um if you just want to play basically the the ps1 obviously i went for the newer one to just kind of check out the voice acting which of course is well done and just some of the you know other changes they've made to it such as um uh kind of the way you'd like i was instinctively trying to hit l1 and r1 to rotate the board but that's not how it works anymore you use the other set or if maybe i was wrong maybe my muscle memory failed me which is completely possible

26:25.100 --> 26:29.205
[SPEAKER_05]: But you use the other stick and now there's like a tactical view you can use, which is kind of neat.

26:29.566 --> 26:31.088
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I've been enjoying it.

26:31.228 --> 26:40.260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not usually into tactical games, but for some reason I always have given Final Fantasy Tactics a pass, probably just because I'm a Final Fantasy fan at heart.

26:40.280 --> 26:49.993
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am working on the thing that many of you do, which is grinding that first area over and over and over again to get up my job levels until I have to take on the actual story quests.

26:49.973 --> 27:07.071
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:07.051 --> 27:10.617
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up going to Knott's Berry Farm, which I have never been to before.

27:10.637 --> 27:15.566
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was completely on a whim, thanks to an internet friend of mine who was like, hey, I have extra tickets.

27:15.606 --> 27:16.287
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to go?

27:16.648 --> 27:18.952
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were like, fuck yeah, let's go to Knott's Berry Farm.

27:19.393 --> 27:21.236
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not get to go to Knott's Scary Farm.

27:21.616 --> 27:23.159
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a different thing in the evening, sadly.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.926
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been to the park outside of the restaurant.

27:26.986 --> 27:27.707
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was cute.

27:27.867 --> 27:28.789
[SPEAKER_05]: It was cute.

27:28.769 --> 27:49.579
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:49.559 --> 28:12.377
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:12.357 --> 28:19.831
[SPEAKER_05]: So we actually went and we did the Fallout maze, which is based on the Amazon TV show, I think a little more than the games.

28:19.851 --> 28:22.556
[SPEAKER_05]: But I definitely got I haven't seen the TV show yet.

28:22.576 --> 28:23.738
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, I've seen the game.

28:24.199 --> 28:35.260
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the games at least a little bit well enough to recognize like, oh, the same little mascots that you see in the game are in the little queue as you're in the thing that the haunted house itself.

28:35.982 --> 28:54.075
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:54.055 --> 28:55.377
[SPEAKER_05]: and are working.

28:55.397 --> 29:00.445
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's still a black light maze where people are trying to jump out of the corner and say, boo.

29:00.765 --> 29:09.899
[SPEAKER_05]: But because so many people are moving through it so quickly, if you just look ahead of you, you can see where all the people are jumping out trying to scare people.

29:09.919 --> 29:11.902
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was just kind of like, okay.

29:11.922 --> 29:16.448
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was having a funny observation with my pal Victoria coming out of there.

29:16.468 --> 29:22.898
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, it's something about the year 2025 where I think people just are like, you know what?

29:22.878 --> 29:23.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Kill me.

29:23.539 --> 29:24.521
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it quick.

29:24.541 --> 29:24.981
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

29:25.001 --> 29:25.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Just off me.

29:25.803 --> 29:26.263
[SPEAKER_05]: End it all.

29:26.664 --> 29:27.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

29:27.646 --> 29:39.064
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really taking the fun out of this stuff because we were in an area, so we did the tram tour, and you'd end up doing this little walkthrough that's like scenes from Megan.

29:39.084 --> 29:40.206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the Blumhouse films.

29:40.486 --> 29:42.169
[SPEAKER_05]: So The Purge was one of them.

29:42.149 --> 30:08.697
[SPEAKER_05]: and there were those big there were those big clowns on stilts and one of them comes up to me goes rah you know trying to scare me and I'm just like you know what I literally I did this and I'm not even trying to be an edgelord or anything I just like literally just my knee-jerk Daria reaction was you know what just do it quick Trump's America couldn't be me like that literally was what I said I'm not even embellishing I literally looked this guy dead in the eye did it and do you know what his response was hmm

30:09.689 --> 30:14.094
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's my territory.

30:14.654 --> 30:18.438
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's just funny to me.

30:18.478 --> 30:23.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

30:23.804 --> 30:37.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

30:37.955 --> 31:05.380
[SPEAKER_05]: so the fallout thing and you know I usually and it's again I get scared pretty easy and I don't like jump scares but because I could look ahead like I could see where all the scares were and there was this guy that came rushing and I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep it real he was an attractive killer he was it was like like the guys that play Norman Bates at Universal he was an attractive killer and he came rushing at me with a pipe and I just gave him a look like this

31:06.895 --> 31:15.011
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I just looked at him like, you know, kind of like, and sorry podcast folks, but I'm giving a look of like, okay, like I'm just looking, I'm like, okay, do it.

31:15.332 --> 31:19.621
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the upper pointed side eye.

31:19.761 --> 31:25.613
[SPEAKER_05]: His response is, as he got to me, he just saluted, he gave me a little two finger salute and walked back.

31:27.382 --> 31:29.466
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost funny to me.

31:29.526 --> 31:30.428
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad.

31:30.448 --> 31:35.777
[SPEAKER_05]: I should probably just play along and act scared and that whole thing.

31:35.817 --> 31:44.814
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time, but I also was three very expensive beverages in by the time we got to the Fallout maze.

31:44.834 --> 31:46.757
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just like, I don't...

31:47.227 --> 31:51.131
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is just kind of... Everything just exists right now.

31:51.331 --> 31:55.855
[SPEAKER_05]: I am but a mere projection onto this plane of existence.

31:55.875 --> 31:58.277
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, you know, I'm just making my way through a maze.

31:58.537 --> 31:59.878
[SPEAKER_05]: Making my way downtown.

31:59.898 --> 32:01.840
[SPEAKER_05]: Disassociating your way through life.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

32:03.101 --> 32:04.402
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's that.

32:04.463 --> 32:09.227
[SPEAKER_05]: So, my review of the Fallout maze was... Sorry, y'all.

32:09.307 --> 32:10.388
[SPEAKER_05]: I disassociated.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.153
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say I was there, but that was only half right.

32:17.180 --> 32:18.201
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there in body.

32:18.802 --> 32:21.024
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

32:21.044 --> 32:22.246
[SPEAKER_05]: The makeup was well done, though.

32:23.127 --> 32:24.648
[SPEAKER_05]: The makeup was well done.

32:24.668 --> 32:27.692
[SPEAKER_05]: The creepy-looking creatures and stuff, they looked good.

32:27.972 --> 32:31.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, again, I mean, you can get the same type of scares at the local.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.220
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would actually encourage you, go support your local haunted house.

32:35.260 --> 32:38.644
[SPEAKER_05]: These are a lot of the same people I work with when the horror movie and the horror hosting.

32:38.965 --> 32:42.829
[SPEAKER_05]: These are just artists that are taking a seasonal gig to help pay the rent and stuff.

32:43.089 --> 32:44.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Go support your local stuff.

32:44.551 --> 32:54.625
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, Universal, they're really not doing anything that much different than what you could get locally, except for an FX budget, which is money well spent.

32:54.965 --> 33:00.092
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks very good and everybody looks good, but you know, that's that.

33:00.112 --> 33:00.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

33:01.995 --> 33:05.360
[SPEAKER_05]: SS2100Matt says, Rob, you and I both want to go out the same way.

33:05.740 --> 33:09.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Rollercoaster ride set to Rihanna and changing to Adele as it crashes.

33:09.265 --> 33:09.926
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

33:09.946 --> 33:10.327
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.

33:10.907 --> 33:11.248
[SPEAKER_05]: No Adele.

33:11.448 --> 33:12.870
[SPEAKER_05]: No Adele.

33:14.572 --> 33:15.554
[SPEAKER_01]: No Adele, please.

33:16.155 --> 33:18.218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the reference to that one meme.

33:18.238 --> 33:28.194
[SPEAKER_05]: It can, you know, it could be, it could actually be, if you don't want Adele, it could actually be the Lady Gaga song, You and I, if that would be an acceptable alternative.

33:28.755 --> 33:29.075
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

33:29.376 --> 33:30.718
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

33:30.738 --> 33:32.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's it for our gaming week.

33:32.821 --> 33:35.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some more gaming news.

33:35.345 --> 33:38.089
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki, the hits just keep on coming.

33:38.130 --> 33:41.154
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's a follow up to last week, right?

33:41.475 --> 33:41.575
Yeah.

33:41.842 --> 33:43.705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just keeps getting better.

33:43.825 --> 33:46.990
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, I know you love EA.

33:47.471 --> 33:49.795
[SPEAKER_04]: You just love EA and all their practices.

33:49.815 --> 33:53.922
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, man, EA is just so infallible.

33:54.022 --> 33:58.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank goodness there's no way I could possibly hate EA by one of their business practices.

33:58.990 --> 34:04.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, selling their company to the Saudis that kill people.

34:04.150 --> 34:05.953
[SPEAKER_04]: That don't agree with them.

34:06.213 --> 34:06.814
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

34:07.115 --> 34:07.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

34:07.916 --> 34:13.164
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, $55 billion deal to take the company private.

34:13.365 --> 34:17.792
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, because I know there are two things being typed in chat right now.

34:18.232 --> 34:20.556
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, Saudi already had an investment in EA.

34:20.676 --> 34:22.820
[SPEAKER_05]: They already owned about 9% of the company.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, Saudi also has a stake in Nintendo.

34:25.444 --> 34:29.571
[SPEAKER_05]: So I loved the way Bobby... Yeah, but 9 to 100, though.

34:29.591 --> 34:30.352
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

34:30.372 --> 34:30.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

34:30.492 --> 34:31.513
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this.

34:31.814 --> 34:34.437
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved the way Bobby put this on his show.

34:34.457 --> 34:37.842
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to give credit to our show before us live.

34:38.162 --> 34:43.269
[SPEAKER_05]: The way Bobby put this on his show was he says, Saudi Arabia is going for a cultural victory in civilization.

34:43.469 --> 34:47.515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, that's an accurate analogy.

34:47.535 --> 34:48.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Bobby.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.619
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm stealing that.

34:51.039 --> 34:52.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Without payment.

34:54.978 --> 35:11.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Jared Kushner's Private Equity Group

35:11.735 --> 35:12.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Gross.

35:13.098 --> 35:21.594
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, so, you know, some concerns, obviously, with, you know, Saudi Arabia owning this company is, you know, censorship.

35:22.556 --> 35:27.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Games like, you know, Mass Effect and stuff like that, they have, you know...

35:27.445 --> 35:52.457
[SPEAKER_04]: gay, trans characters, I'm not sure if there's trans characters in but essentially a wide variety of sexual orientations amongst the characters that's not going to probably be just say Mass Effect I said Mass Effect and there was trans in Andromeda because it was actually a point of contention but it's old news at this point

35:52.437 --> 36:02.791
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, well, that said, though, those diverse characters with those types of backgrounds are probably not going to be featured in games, you know, going forward.

36:03.572 --> 36:11.883
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, honestly, you know, with like the sports washing stuff that they've done recently with purchasing was the stuff with the WWE.

36:11.904 --> 36:16.690
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, you know, events going on there, comedy festivals, you

36:16.670 --> 36:23.597
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the whole golf, they have their own golf circuit thing that's in Saudi Arabia as well.

36:23.617 --> 36:35.928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I don't see this going well, but also I see this kind of ironically, it's ironically an interesting way for EA to possibly, like their demise.

36:36.329 --> 36:45.057
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, whereas EA is a company that used to purchase a bunch of smaller companies and then take those companies, essentially strip their assets from them and then close those companies and

36:46.015 --> 36:46.436
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this!

36:47.338 --> 36:48.781
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come full circle.

36:49.142 --> 37:00.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a private equity group that purchased EA that will of course try to do well with it, but inevitably will strip its assets and sell it off piecemeal.

37:00.546 --> 37:01.408
[SPEAKER_04]: How appropriate.

37:02.705 --> 37:07.272
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, Bob Coffee in chat says Asadi Group also bought the EVO tournament.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Asadi Group also owns what part of wrestling?

37:09.835 --> 37:15.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Asadi Group owns – like there's a lot of – I'm sure – I think one of the big networks, Asadi has an investment in that too.

37:15.684 --> 37:23.234
[SPEAKER_05]: If only there was a governing body that could do something about these types of sales such as saying, no, you can't have these types of sales.

37:23.254 --> 37:25.437
[SPEAKER_05]: If only there were a governing body that could do that.

37:25.457 --> 37:28.662
[SPEAKER_05]: But oh, when –

37:28.642 --> 37:37.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that's why you get the son-in-law involved, and now the president will have a personal stake in this particular type of acquisition.

37:37.272 --> 37:47.143
[SPEAKER_05]: And President Carter sold his peanut farm, but I guess those sorts of norms just don't exist anymore.

37:47.183 --> 37:49.265
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't exist anymore.

37:49.426 --> 37:49.986
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have norms.

37:50.507 --> 37:53.350
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going through is not normal.

37:54.123 --> 37:56.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Bob Coffey says, if only we had a functional federal government.

37:56.773 --> 37:56.974
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

37:57.055 --> 38:01.753
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why maybe, maybe that's why this waited until now.

38:04.990 --> 38:06.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

38:06.312 --> 38:18.691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say if your favorite EA game is not a sports game, is not a shooty, shooty, bang, bang game called, you know, what's not Call of Duty, the other one, Battlefield.

38:19.813 --> 38:21.275
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's shooty, shooty, bang, bang.

38:21.315 --> 38:25.602
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, if it's not a shooty, bang, bang game and if it's not The Sims.

38:25.802 --> 38:25.902
Yeah.

38:27.350 --> 38:28.613
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably in trouble.

38:28.633 --> 38:30.517
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, that includes Mass Effect.

38:30.537 --> 38:42.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the best thing because because what's going to happen now, I want to go back to something I said earlier about people as as much of an issue as Phil Spencer has been these last couple of years.

38:42.123 --> 38:46.793
[SPEAKER_05]: In the beginning, you wanted to root for him a little bit because he was an actual gamer.

38:46.773 --> 38:49.436
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen with this EA thing?

38:49.456 --> 38:54.822
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people who are not gamers are going to get in the room, and they're going to look at Bioware.

38:55.203 --> 38:57.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look at this studio's performance.

38:57.646 --> 38:59.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what have they been working on?

38:59.107 --> 39:00.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they put out a game last year.

39:01.290 --> 39:05.795
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that game didn't really make the money we were thinking it was going to make.

39:05.815 --> 39:07.577
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what did that studio do before that?

39:07.597 --> 39:08.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Anthem.

39:09.059 --> 39:14.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're saying this studio hasn't really put out a profitable game?

39:15.766 --> 39:16.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, huh.

39:18.950 --> 39:23.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I think we got $20 billion in debt.

39:23.154 --> 39:37.407
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the best you can hope for in this situation is that Mass Effect becomes an asset that is put up for sale that another company who will know how to treat it with dignity will buy it.

39:37.427 --> 39:45.535
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think the ironic thing, the ironic thing is that the people that probably want BioWare the most

39:45.920 --> 39:46.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

39:46.761 --> 39:47.041
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?

39:48.683 --> 39:49.284
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.810
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would be the first to put a bid on BioWare?

39:54.830 --> 39:56.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft.

39:56.572 --> 39:57.153
[SPEAKER_05]: With what money?

39:57.754 --> 40:00.317
[SPEAKER_05]: And there lies the rub.

40:01.978 --> 40:15.454
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't, you know, I would, you know, of course, I sit here and cross my fingers and my toes and go, is there a way that there can be a fire sale on Bioshock's IPs and, like, Larian can pick it up?

40:16.598 --> 40:35.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of the fog comes a mysterious stranger It is Atari

40:36.612 --> 40:39.819
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I'm not going to hate on that.

40:40.561 --> 40:43.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Atari hasn't had a lot of losing decisions lately.

40:43.948 --> 40:45.291
[SPEAKER_05]: They're kind of like Konami.

40:45.893 --> 40:48.518
[SPEAKER_05]: Atari and Konami are on similar paths.

40:48.538 --> 40:53.810
[SPEAKER_05]: They were laughable 10, 15 years ago, but right now it's kind of like, you're doing good, kid.

40:53.930 --> 40:55.093
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep at it, you know?

40:55.193 --> 40:56.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40:57.706 --> 41:01.971
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless there is any possible way, Bioware could go single again.

41:02.211 --> 41:04.974
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be incredible, but I worry about that.

41:05.014 --> 41:07.197
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's happened before.

41:07.437 --> 41:10.721
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that as a match in heaven.

41:10.981 --> 41:23.916
[SPEAKER_05]: That is like the light your candle before you go to bed tonight in hopes that that, or whatever it is you believe in, thoughts and prayers, whatever it takes, let Larian buy the Bioware IPs in a fire sale and let's get back to the old Bioware.

41:23.896 --> 41:33.449
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Buster in chat says, I wouldn't be surprised if Ailguard was the last Dragon Age we'll ever see, if not for a long, long time because it missed performance targets unless it's handed to someone else.

41:33.609 --> 41:38.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, unless it's an IP that's sold off, which I would say do not rule out that possibility.

41:39.738 --> 41:48.570
[SPEAKER_05]: That a room full of non-gamer boardroom types will not understand the value of some of these IPs.

41:51.622 --> 41:52.404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's possible.

41:52.464 --> 41:55.030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just who's going to buy them is the risk there.

41:55.852 --> 41:57.536
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep all the Bioware stuff together.

41:57.836 --> 42:01.405
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeger in chat is saying, the Sims is crazy in trouble with this deal.

42:01.505 --> 42:08.381
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be curious for you to evaluate because I thought that series actually made EA quite a bit of money even all this time later.

42:08.421 --> 42:10.626
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got a new one ready to launch, right?

42:11.483 --> 42:15.090
[SPEAKER_01]: They just... Their problem with the Sims is their oversaturation.

42:15.591 --> 42:34.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if they've had the money to build, what, 74 expansion packs for the last Sims game, I feel like that's something that, at least on paper, they're going to look... This is going to come down to an Excel spreadsheet, whether a studio is running or closing.

42:34.045 --> 42:35.146
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob.

42:35.266 --> 42:35.506
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

42:36.047 --> 42:37.128
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be Excel.

42:37.168 --> 42:37.828
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in numbers.

42:38.269 --> 42:47.437
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, considering the subject matter, I think you should let it be with Excel that these studios could be coming and going.

42:48.478 --> 42:54.804
[SPEAKER_05]: SG100 Matt says, My only hope is that when they lay off employees that they treat them well and give them good severance packages.

42:54.824 --> 43:00.088
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be terrible if they do the, quote, soft layoff route that many tech companies are doing these days.

43:00.929 --> 43:04.052
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice, and I don't want to be –

43:04.032 --> 43:08.119
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pessimistic about it, but unfortunately I am.

43:08.285 --> 43:09.707
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hope, yes, I hope you're right.

43:10.468 --> 43:15.516
[SPEAKER_05]: SG-100 Matt says, this won't go through until 2027, so there is time, but not much.

43:15.917 --> 43:18.801
[SPEAKER_05]: There is stuff that will go down sooner rather than later.

43:19.262 --> 43:28.295
[SPEAKER_05]: I would expect to see things start to move around in months, not years.

43:28.576 --> 43:34.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeger is elaborating on the Sims stuff, saying Sims is not doing super well, and the themes...

43:34.880 --> 43:35.881
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a source for that?

43:36.401 --> 43:41.506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, it's just I'm kind of like, again, they've had so many expansions.

43:41.526 --> 43:44.949
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in a holding pattern now because we haven't had a mainline game in a long time.

43:45.889 --> 43:49.392
[SPEAKER_05]: But, okay, super LGBTQ stuff would be in danger.

43:49.472 --> 43:52.975
[SPEAKER_05]: The player base is also primarily LGBTQ+, as well.

43:52.995 --> 43:54.577
[SPEAKER_05]: So take those options away and it's done.

43:54.657 --> 43:56.238
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that part I'm with you with.

43:56.839 --> 43:57.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, with you on.

43:57.919 --> 43:59.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that part does make sense.

43:59.941 --> 44:04.465
[SPEAKER_05]: That, unfortunately, those types of themes, they're going to say no...

44:05.440 --> 44:09.528
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate myself with every fiber of my being for what I'm about to say.

44:09.949 --> 44:12.494
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're going to say no woke games.

44:12.514 --> 44:13.596
[SPEAKER_05]: No woke games.

44:16.482 --> 44:19.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to wash my mouth out with soap after saying that.

44:19.888 --> 44:20.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

44:20.449 --> 44:21.532
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just, you know.

44:23.215 --> 44:23.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I wrong?

44:26.581 --> 44:27.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I don't think I am.

44:29.977 --> 44:31.079
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

44:31.760 --> 44:32.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, moving on.

44:33.323 --> 44:40.577
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to something, a bit of good news, you know, because and maybe this is what ends up happening.

44:40.597 --> 44:47.850
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard of this sort of thing before is that when the gaming industry starts to buckle and starts to sort of

44:47.830 --> 45:17.213
[SPEAKER_05]: you know experience a recession of sorts which I kind of think we've been hurling towards for a while now and this is all just going to accelerate that inevitable happenstance I think there's going to be a lot of people looking at the classics a lot of people looking at old games a lot of people finally looking at their backlog going there's a lot of good games out there I haven't played I should go play some of the Loki will finally go check out his fucking Steam backlog I just added more games to it today it's a self read

45:17.193 --> 45:19.177
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, the sale's going on too, right?

45:19.798 --> 45:20.819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

45:20.920 --> 45:27.331
[SPEAKER_04]: I have months and months and months of humble choice that I forget to redeem.

45:28.032 --> 45:31.018
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's like, ooh, Plucky Squire, cool.

45:31.398 --> 45:32.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw that in the backlog.

45:33.162 --> 45:34.524
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a bunch of games.

45:35.125 --> 45:36.788
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm never going to get around to playing

45:36.768 --> 45:43.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, the nice thing is there's still a soft spot for nostalgia and nostalgia for these old games will probably squeeze us through.

45:43.917 --> 45:48.483
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the Lego Game Boy came out recently, and that's been kind of in the news.

45:48.503 --> 45:53.650
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot of people posting their builds online and people are really excited about this Lego Game Boy.

45:54.191 --> 45:58.877
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the question was probably out there from the very beginning of how long is it going to take?

45:58.857 --> 46:02.201
[SPEAKER_05]: for somebody to shove a real Game Boy into a Lego Game Boy.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.784
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it turns out, not long at all.

46:05.505 --> 46:23.465
[SPEAKER_05]: A creator online named NatalieTheNerd, who has a blog on the website NatalieTheNerd.com, actually used this system, the Lego system, to add power to it to actually play genuine Game Boy cartridges.

46:23.826 --> 46:26.709
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to see her post over on Blue Sky, you can.

46:27.029 --> 46:28.611
[SPEAKER_05]: She is also verified by Donut

46:28.591 --> 46:48.135
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:48.571 --> 46:51.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

46:51.736 --> 47:06.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

47:06.661 --> 47:10.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting to put a Game Boy inside your Game Boy is always going to be good news.

47:11.308 --> 47:16.295
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, yeah, you can use it to play small screen games on there.

47:16.335 --> 47:20.140
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's not like this is something that's commercially available out there.

47:21.022 --> 47:27.411
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some fixes that still need to be made, like the A and B keys are currently being held in by an elastic band.

47:27.491 --> 47:30.896
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be a 3D printed Lego piece to help fix some of this.

47:31.336 --> 47:36.043
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she does say, I'm going to release this once I'm happy with it, which I would assume would mean...

47:36.023 --> 47:39.867
[SPEAKER_05]: all the parts that you need and 3D printing specs you need to build your own.

47:40.508 --> 47:46.354
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if she doesn't do it soon, I'm sure somebody else will.

47:46.434 --> 47:47.315
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a read.

47:47.355 --> 47:55.263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just if it really is supposed to be Patreon paywalled, it's probably a matter of time before somebody else does it anyway.

47:55.523 --> 47:57.585
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's neat, though.

47:57.625 --> 48:02.430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat to see people using those nostalgia products for their nostalgia.

48:02.790 --> 48:05.473
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

48:05.572 --> 48:10.138
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100 Matt points out, I'll finish my LEGO Game Boy build tonight after the show.

48:10.158 --> 48:12.461
[SPEAKER_05]: And QuestBuster says, yay Game Boy goodness.

48:12.641 --> 48:13.602
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

48:13.622 --> 48:18.148
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a bunch of the classic Game Boy stuff on my Steam Deck.

48:18.468 --> 48:30.744
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the first, if you had a Game Boy emulator in front of you with every Game Boy, a LEGO Game Boy with every Game Boy game, what's the first game you'd want to play on it again?

48:30.784 --> 48:31.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Revenge of the Gator.

48:32.066 --> 48:33.267
[SPEAKER_05]: You took my answer.

48:34.630 --> 48:40.740
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the right answer, Revenge of the Game Fine, Pokemon Pinball Or was that Advance?

48:40.760 --> 48:50.235
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think there was a Pokemon I think Pokemon Pinball, Red and Blue Or maybe Kid Dracula Okay, okay But I actually have Kid Dracula Loki, what's your answer?

48:51.497 --> 48:59.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I do have a Game Boy emulator in front of me But I would say probably there's a...

49:00.196 --> 49:10.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Homebrew Mario game that rescales like because, you know, they ported like the original Mario Brothers to it and stuff like that.

49:10.194 --> 49:12.619
[SPEAKER_04]: But the like scaling was really weird on the Game Boy.

49:13.100 --> 49:19.251
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would play that port with the additional levels and stuff because it's fun.

49:19.231 --> 49:21.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf agrees, Revenge of the Gator.

49:21.656 --> 49:23.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranmari says Yoshi's Cookie.

49:23.179 --> 49:23.900
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good choice, too.

49:24.261 --> 49:25.644
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTutsia says Tetris.

49:25.905 --> 49:29.271
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, a standard.

49:29.291 --> 49:30.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Hyper Lode Runner.

49:30.534 --> 49:35.945
[SPEAKER_05]: And OrangeRite says Triple Jinx with Bobby Blackwolf and DarkSakura.

49:36.165 --> 49:37.147
[SPEAKER_01]: Great minds think like us.

49:38.851 --> 49:39.151
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

49:39.853 --> 49:40.314
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

49:40.334 --> 49:40.935
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

49:42.147 --> 49:45.351
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is not just good news.

49:45.371 --> 49:47.274
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty freaking great.

49:47.975 --> 50:11.327
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a local monthly fighting game tournament and a new mom who goes by Legion with a zero, a 3D artist actually who sometimes plays fighting games, basically won the tournament with her newborn in her lap five days after a C-section.

50:11.965 --> 50:15.189
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hear any of your excuses, guys, okay?

50:16.410 --> 50:18.372
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what a C-section does to you?

50:20.334 --> 50:22.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how much it hurts to recover from?

50:22.837 --> 50:24.098
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I've had one.

50:24.238 --> 50:25.720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a surgery, yeah.

50:25.880 --> 50:28.283
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do own a uterus.

50:30.205 --> 50:37.293
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have a good background in anatomy, and I know what happens to the body during pregnancy, which is why I don't ever want to do it.

50:38.154 --> 50:38.614
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

50:39.269 --> 51:06.711
[SPEAKER_01]: but imagine that so that you have been cut open while you are awake having a living being taken from your body sewn back up and five days later winning a Mortal Kombat tournament with this tiny brilliant miracle of a human being in your arms I don't want to hear your excuses I don't have don't want to hear them I don't have any excuses but can I make a joke

51:07.147 --> 51:08.769
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, the best thing, the best thing.

51:08.790 --> 51:09.691
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the kid's name is?

51:11.033 --> 51:11.514
[SPEAKER_01]: Cereza.

51:13.677 --> 51:15.079
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the contestant's name again?

51:17.683 --> 51:18.084
[SPEAKER_01]: Legion.

51:18.605 --> 51:19.246
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Legion.

51:19.286 --> 51:21.850
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say Legion wins.

51:22.791 --> 51:23.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Babality.

51:24.874 --> 51:31.264
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, but you get where the baby's name comes from, right?

51:31.514 --> 51:32.515
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

51:32.615 --> 51:34.256
[SPEAKER_05]: I was marinating too much.

51:34.457 --> 51:34.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Bayonetta.

51:34.917 --> 51:36.238
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a good one.

51:36.258 --> 51:38.040
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

51:38.060 --> 51:38.440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

51:39.501 --> 51:41.523
[SPEAKER_05]: I was marinating too much on my Vivaldi joke.

51:41.663 --> 51:42.484
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, let me say my joke.

51:42.504 --> 51:43.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me say my joke.

51:44.085 --> 51:44.545
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

51:44.565 --> 51:47.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you're not the first to make it, for the record.

51:49.350 --> 51:49.670
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Great minds think like me.

51:52.232 --> 52:01.420
[SPEAKER_01]: But she, with the win, one of her posts says, I only win because she coached me mid-set sending our daughter to DreamHack.

52:02.378 --> 52:09.256
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, she has a habit of trying to bite my chest whenever I hold her upright so her face was smooshed for a fraction of a sec.

52:11.862 --> 52:12.424
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cute.

52:12.604 --> 52:13.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's cute.

52:13.467 --> 52:14.008
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cute.

52:14.670 --> 52:15.612
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

52:16.958 --> 52:31.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great story about, yeah, again, if you thought you had a hard week or you can't do something because of it's hard or something, it's a nice story to remind us.

52:31.353 --> 52:33.555
[SPEAKER_05]: You can probably do more than you think you can.

52:35.297 --> 52:35.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

52:35.417 --> 52:35.658
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

52:36.478 --> 52:40.523
[SPEAKER_05]: But what you can't do right now is not patch your Unity game, right, Loki?

52:40.723 --> 52:40.823
Yeah.

52:41.647 --> 53:01.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you probably could patch your Unity game, but it is going to be a little bit tricky because there was a recently discovered security vulnerability that affected any games and applications built on Unity version 2017.1 and later.

53:01.373 --> 53:03.215
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

53:03.275 --> 53:17.593
[SPEAKER_04]: For Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems, there's no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers, according to Larry, Major Nelson Herb.

53:19.175 --> 53:27.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, along with that, though, Obsidian Entertainment did pull their Pillars of Eternity 2, Deadfire, and Pentament,

53:27.125 --> 53:33.756
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as more games from Steam on Friday just as a precautionary measure.

53:34.457 --> 53:38.784
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be rolling out a patch for that though to fix the vulnerability.

53:40.327 --> 53:42.771
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't opened Unity in a while.

53:42.953 --> 54:07.375
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely saw games getting patched this week Ingress and the Niantic stuff was definitely getting all patched I feel like I had a lot of phone apps update this week which makes sense, Unity is used in a lot of phone game development and boy are they keeping a tight lip on what the vulnerability really was which makes sense, they don't want people to actually there's a lot of games that haven't patched yet and they don't want to get out there

54:07.355 --> 54:08.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them any ideas.

54:08.617 --> 54:08.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

54:08.857 --> 54:10.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give them any ideas type of thing.

54:10.859 --> 54:19.230
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course you want to know like, well, shit, how bad is it that they've got to be doing all these games and stuff this week?

54:19.250 --> 54:23.395
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not going to know because that's the plan is to not tell us.

54:24.696 --> 54:29.362
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say, was this an ethical hacker that figured this out and sent it to Unity?

54:29.382 --> 54:33.447
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it sounds like somebody found this and instead of doing anything –

54:33.427 --> 54:39.559
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative with it, they went straight to Unity and were like, hey, I found a problem.

54:39.739 --> 54:47.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think it mentions who reported it, but yeah, somehow they found it, so...

54:47.821 --> 54:51.105
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt says, I'm sure YYR had to update stuff.

54:51.125 --> 54:55.790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hopefully the process isn't too difficult.

54:56.050 --> 55:13.069
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I heard Bobby talking a little bit about this on his show, and it sounds like you don't have to get in there and update a bunch of code, that it has more to do with the actual executable runtime file, and you can patch that even if you don't have all your old code.

55:13.049 --> 55:23.072
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of nice that, you know, you don't go because heaven forbid, there's probably a lot of studios that have closed since 2017 that have Unity games that are actually running.

55:23.092 --> 55:26.280
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, hopefully YYR is able to update his stuff.

55:26.320 --> 55:32.053
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem as well, because I would hate to see them start pulling games that don't adhere to this.

55:32.033 --> 55:46.574
[SPEAKER_05]: BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, the vulnerability was, quoting from the email that was sent to Unity, or from Unity, says, the vulnerability was responsibly reported by the security researcher Ryotak, and we thank him for working with us.

55:46.594 --> 55:55.787
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's a very nice way of saying ethical hacker, which actually I don't think is a negative term at all, but probably not a polite one in the context of an email like this.

55:55.847 --> 56:00.994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, I mean, that guy could have done some shitty things, or

56:00.974 --> 56:01.655
[SPEAKER_05]: or Person.

56:01.675 --> 56:05.881
[SPEAKER_05]: That person could have done a lot of shitty things with that information, but they didn't.

56:05.901 --> 56:08.384
[SPEAKER_05]: So good on them.

56:10.927 --> 56:11.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

56:12.850 --> 56:14.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Politics, politics, politics.

56:14.252 --> 56:15.213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's never ending.

56:15.233 --> 56:15.854
[SPEAKER_05]: But guess what?

56:15.914 --> 56:18.477
[SPEAKER_05]: This one has nothing to do with us.

56:18.578 --> 56:19.399
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a little bit maybe.

56:19.439 --> 56:21.902
[SPEAKER_05]: It has more to do with what's going on in Japan.

56:22.169 --> 56:44.700
[SPEAKER_05]: and a politician from Japan's House of Representatives, Satoshi Asano, made a post on social media saying that Nintendo was "...avoiding using generative AI to protect its IP and "...engaging in lobbying activities with the government."

56:45.153 --> 56:48.478
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo actually came out and denied this.

56:49.459 --> 56:53.425
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a rare thing for Nintendo to do.

56:54.867 --> 57:11.312
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the right-wing social media site X, Nintendo's account, their Japanese account, actually published a statement that says, "...contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI."

57:11.292 --> 57:34.161
[SPEAKER_05]: whether generative AI is involved or not we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights and that was the particular post there from Nintendo that they actually posted interesting that they actually called that out um

57:34.850 --> 57:40.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn right, you better.

57:40.997 --> 57:57.735
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?

58:03.824 --> 58:05.847
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, I'm speechless.

58:07.309 --> 58:09.512
[SPEAKER_05]: You're trying to get a jump, is what they're trying to do.

58:09.572 --> 58:12.155
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be nice if that's how it was?

58:12.856 --> 58:18.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be nice if when people were wrong, they say, oops, I was wrong and I'm sorry?

58:18.724 --> 58:28.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be what people of integrity and high... I think it's a foreign concept here, though.

58:28.617 --> 58:28.778
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

58:28.798 --> 58:29.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly.

58:30.031 --> 58:51.274
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, outgoing Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has talked about Nintendo's and AI previously saying, quote, if we think about just technology in general to start with, as we look at technology, we always want to make sure the technology we may be leveraging, whether it's to develop our games or in our devices, it's going to create a better gameplay experience.

58:51.294 --> 58:52.135
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts there.

58:52.295 --> 58:59.143
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very important part of our decision-making process and how to use AI, which honestly is a real fluff statement.

58:59.123 --> 59:03.649
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does go to show at least that they're not being reckless about it.

59:04.170 --> 59:12.422
[SPEAKER_05]: It does sort of say to me the justification for is the game fun needs to still be there.

59:12.962 --> 59:15.746
[SPEAKER_05]: If we use AI on our game, is the game still going to be fun?

59:15.866 --> 59:17.689
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be our driving principle.

59:18.445 --> 59:46.967
[SPEAKER_05]: which is not a bad principle to have especially compared to peers because that says to me you're thinking less about generative AI and that crap and cutting or especially when it comes to art and that kind of crap and more like maybe how can our own internal mechanisms you know sort of improve and so forth which you know it's interesting it's interesting but they have not said anything as far as the official Japanese government goes

59:48.247 --> 59:56.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, yeah, and Rinmari does point out where Japanese people still post, it's because they don't know any better.

59:56.216 --> 01:00:00.821
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them try Blue Sky or Miski for five seconds and just go back to Twitter.

01:00:01.342 --> 01:00:02.062
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:07.829
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going to remind folks where the money you make on X, where that goes.

01:00:08.269 --> 01:00:12.054
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's if you still decide, that's fine.

01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:12.394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you.

01:00:13.315 --> 01:00:14.136
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

01:00:14.116 --> 01:00:41.423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

01:00:42.533 --> 01:00:50.028
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in one of the happier pieces of news, I get the happy stuff today, don't I?

01:00:52.312 --> 01:00:56.180
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's more good Silent Hill news.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:04.356
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a remake of the first Silent Hill, and it's already going into full production, working with Bloober Team.

01:01:04.336 --> 01:01:09.685
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they said, I'm going to read the translated statement.

01:01:09.705 --> 01:01:12.529
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is, uh, during an investor call.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:21.484
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two first party production teams, one of which is working on Silent Hill one project and the other started working on the next project.

01:01:21.584 --> 01:01:22.866
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be Silent Hill three.

01:01:23.808 --> 01:01:28.335
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then they also discussed, uh, Kronos, the new Dawn, um,

01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:40.671
[SPEAKER_01]: which got really good reviews but Konami did tease it already with those photos and stuff but this is good news this is good news

01:01:42.338 --> 01:01:48.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially, you know, when there was a little bit of worry about the Silent Hill 2 remake and it turned out pretty good.

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:52.618
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's, I feel like everybody's kind of at ease about this.

01:01:52.638 --> 01:01:53.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all right, bring it on.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.142
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it.

01:01:55.162 --> 01:01:56.685
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Bloober, you did something.

01:01:56.705 --> 01:01:57.226
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:57.747
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

01:01:57.767 --> 01:01:58.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it again.

01:01:58.409 --> 01:01:59.010
[SPEAKER_05]: Two in a row.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.132
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't.

01:02:00.192 --> 01:02:04.220
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want Silent Hill 3 because, you know, that's my favorite of them all.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:04.380
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:31.330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

01:02:32.744 --> 01:02:44.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so this is disappointing, but apparently Avalanche Studios has announced that their studio located in Liverpool is shutting down.

01:02:45.475 --> 01:02:53.643
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really heard much from them as far as new games coming out, but I know that one that obviously comes to mind for me is Just Cause.

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:54.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Love that series.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:03:00.709
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, apparently they posted a short update saying that the company...

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:07.517
[SPEAKER_04]: has been that all employees will be impacted and that that Liverpool location is being closed.

01:03:08.338 --> 01:03:16.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to be planning layoffs for its Swedish studios as well in Malmo in Stockholm.

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:19.435
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that sucks.

01:03:20.276 --> 01:03:24.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that could be because we haven't heard of any games that they're putting out.

01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:47.368
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they're working on a game called Contraband but I haven't heard too much about that other than that and that was announced back in 2021 um yeah that sucks but if you don't have the revenue coming in I guess that makes sense I mean it's just one after another and it's one week this is one week in 2025 I don't know what else to say

01:03:48.344 --> 01:03:54.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about Departure from the Mortal Kombat studio.

01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:56.543
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's one you might recognize.

01:03:56.623 --> 01:03:59.349
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the guy that says, Toasty!

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:06.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's been a few years since that guy showed up because he was with, and this is Dan Forden who we're talking about, who was the audio director at Mortal Kombat.

01:04:06.907 --> 01:04:09.390
[SPEAKER_05]: He was with that studio for 30 years.

01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:11.212
[SPEAKER_05]: He left NetherRealm.

01:04:11.232 --> 01:04:11.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he left.

01:04:12.553 --> 01:04:20.181
[SPEAKER_05]: And on October 2nd, he made a post to Instagram that Wednesday was his last... I'm just laughing at all the social media announcements.

01:04:20.301 --> 01:04:23.224
[SPEAKER_05]: That Wednesday was his last day at NetherRealm.

01:04:24.245 --> 01:04:33.235
[SPEAKER_05]: And previously, he went all the way back to Midway Chicago and worked pretty much through Mortal Kombat 1, which came out a couple years ago.

01:04:33.215 --> 01:04:35.608
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course you know him as the toasty guy.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:37.740
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks a lot different now.

01:04:37.906 --> 01:04:40.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Age, it happens, right?

01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:47.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Toasty Dan is who he's referred to as sometimes online.

01:04:47.197 --> 01:04:49.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting quotes in his goodbye post.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.844
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, we made a lot of fun stuff over the years.

01:04:52.864 --> 01:04:57.309
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff.

01:04:57.329 --> 01:04:59.572
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many smart, talented people there.

01:04:59.932 --> 01:05:04.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.

01:05:04.758 --> 01:05:04.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:05:04.838 --> 01:05:13.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to all of you in supporting what we've done.

01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:16.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Goodbye and good luck.

01:05:17.191 --> 01:05:18.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy retirement, though, dude.

01:05:19.014 --> 01:05:19.515
[SPEAKER_05]: You earned it.

01:05:19.935 --> 01:05:21.558
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely left a legacy in gaming.

01:05:23.061 --> 01:05:24.743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the toasty thing.

01:05:24.763 --> 01:05:30.693
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think the sound in the Mortal Kombat games is part of what makes those games great.

01:05:30.713 --> 01:05:36.162
[SPEAKER_05]: It put it on a different... It distincted itself from Street Fighter.

01:05:36.142 --> 01:05:58.977
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is a very different musical style too yeah not yeah the music and the sound effects it just it lent itself to that style that made it different from Street Fighter at the end of the day and um yeah so enjoy retirement hope you hope you get some you know like cruises or whatever it is you enjoy all right anyway uh let's get to our next segment another classic

01:06:09.301 --> 01:06:17.156
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:06:17.176 --> 01:06:20.161
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:06:20.582 --> 01:06:24.009
[SPEAKER_05]: But tonight we have a once a month special.

01:06:24.229 --> 01:06:29.599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the classic arcade game that then became a console game.

01:06:29.759 --> 01:06:32.845
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is our classic arcade to console game this week, DarkSakura?

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.013
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:39.282
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, this one became console to arcade back to console.

01:06:40.524 --> 01:06:50.344
[SPEAKER_01]: So, of course, I am referring to the version for the versus Unisystem, as in versus Excitebike.

01:06:50.459 --> 01:06:56.847
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two enhanced versions, both that were titled versus Excitebike.

01:06:57.208 --> 01:07:00.412
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start, though, with the arcade version.

01:07:01.413 --> 01:07:14.890
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out in 1984, and it's very similar to the Famicom disc version, even though it lacks, of course, the design option for custom tracks.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.594
[SPEAKER_01]: It has three difficulty levels and a few other differences.

01:07:17.994 --> 01:07:19.977
[SPEAKER_01]: And among these differences...

01:07:19.957 --> 01:07:25.711
[SPEAKER_01]: is, well, I mean, first of all, it has seven tracks instead of five, like the NES.

01:07:26.654 --> 01:07:30.323
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're more like remix tracks is what they are.

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:36.177
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you finish the seventh track, the last stage will just loop itself until you lose.

01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:38.685
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it is pretty repetitive.

01:07:39.046 --> 01:07:50.149
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other cool features that it has is that there is a bonus game that will challenge you to hit ramps in order to jump over stacked trucks for extra points.

01:07:50.534 --> 01:08:11.699
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the other one is sort of like a wipeout mode where you have to make the other players crash and then your character will change colors going from, you know, go to red, yellow or a black color scheme and have unlimited turbo until you crash.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.183
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's Excitebike.

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:16.525
[SPEAKER_01]: Now...

01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:23.498
[SPEAKER_01]: The other version is Versus Excite for the Famicom Disk System.

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:27.063
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically you can play Versus.

01:08:27.744 --> 01:08:28.645
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play with a friend.

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:33.271
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has different music done by Okasoyo.

01:08:34.432 --> 01:08:44.385
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have original Excite mode where it's based off of the main mode of the arcade version with some minor differences like the color palette.

01:08:44.365 --> 01:08:46.990
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is a writable disc that can save your tracks.

01:08:47.731 --> 01:08:59.792
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought that up because it's sort of getting an arcade port of a port of a home game

01:09:00.835 --> 01:09:06.202
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the arcade port of the home game, and then you have a home game port of the arcade game.

01:09:07.724 --> 01:09:09.467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what I just said.

01:09:09.487 --> 01:09:10.068
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I get it.

01:09:10.088 --> 01:09:11.069
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way that makes sense.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:14.774
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's wild, yeah, how this kind of went back and forth and back and forth, right?

01:09:15.956 --> 01:09:21.884
[SPEAKER_01]: And that version, for the record, I do believe has come out on a virtual arcade since.

01:09:25.148 --> 01:09:25.729
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:27.674
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:28.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Your arcade console game.

01:09:28.815 --> 01:09:30.837
[SPEAKER_05]: A favorite of mine, actually.

01:09:31.378 --> 01:09:32.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Excitebike.

01:09:32.879 --> 01:09:34.621
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there was a BS Excitebike?

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:45.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was a BS Excitebike, and there was one on the 3DS that I think was based off the arcade version.

01:09:45.312 --> 01:09:47.074
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember, but there was a 3DS one.

01:09:47.094 --> 01:09:48.896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the virtual console one, right?

01:09:49.536 --> 01:09:50.097
[SPEAKER_05]: It was different.

01:09:50.117 --> 01:09:53.320
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually had the layers, like Kid Icarus had one, too.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.466
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was Boom Boom Mario Battle Stadium.

01:09:56.486 --> 01:09:57.748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

01:09:57.828 --> 01:10:08.286
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike Boom Boom Mario Battle Station, which is also known as Mario Excitebike, or BS Excitebike, was a remake that only came out for this to tell of you, but I think that that one was re-released.

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:12.274
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, I'm just double-checking that one.

01:10:12.294 --> 01:10:14.818
[SPEAKER_01]: There was 3D Classics Excitebike.

01:10:15.355 --> 01:10:20.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I actually done Excitebike as a classic game?

01:10:20.829 --> 01:10:21.851
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to think that I did.

01:10:23.074 --> 01:10:25.500
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the one that has like the...

01:10:26.206 --> 01:10:28.028
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wrong.

01:10:28.268 --> 01:10:32.473
[SPEAKER_01]: That was back to the Satellaview one, which was Mario, Luigi, Princess, Peach, Wario, and Toad.

01:10:35.516 --> 01:10:36.557
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I see.

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:44.706
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an Animal Crossing No, that was the one that was in Animal Crossing that could be transferred to Game Boy Advance.

01:10:44.946 --> 01:10:47.409
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking through it now because I didn't read through the rest of the stuff.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:55.538
[SPEAKER_01]: Excitebike was added to Wii's Virtual Console the day that Excite Truck was released.

01:10:56.159 --> 01:11:12.105
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it later came out on the North American Virtual Console and then there were 3D Classics Excitebike on the 3DS and had stereoscopic support and it didn't say anything about the characters.

01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:14.269
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:20.530
[SPEAKER_05]: but still a true classic, especially on the Nintendo front in all its different forms.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's important to note and you're kind of bringing to the forefront by highlighting the arcade version.

01:11:25.661 --> 01:11:33.658
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many versions of this game that are different from what you would have played on the Nintendo Entertainment System and not just the fact that you had a very...

01:11:33.638 --> 01:11:40.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, kind of lazy port of a Famicom Disk System game where the save and load were left in, you know, type of thing.

01:11:41.093 --> 01:11:46.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just that, but just, you know, the fact that they actually, you know, different courses and there are more of them and all the other things you pointed out.

01:11:46.684 --> 01:11:48.107
[SPEAKER_05]: So good times.

01:11:49.129 --> 01:11:49.710
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:54.620
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's cover some other headlines in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll start with you.

01:11:56.572 --> 01:12:04.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Fallout 76 has some new updates coming to tie into the Fallout TV show.

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:15.637
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only will they also have an expansion that will go to Ohio, but you'll be able to run into the ghoul from the Fallout TV show.

01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:20.083
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's going to be coming out here very soon.

01:12:20.984 --> 01:12:25.330
[SPEAKER_04]: And then along with that, we've also got...

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:33.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, so Marvel Cosmic Invasion, that awesome looking beat-em-up game has a demo.

01:12:33.294 --> 01:12:34.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.

01:12:34.397 --> 01:12:35.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks cool.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait to play it.

01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:38.208
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely want to check that out.

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:40.956
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

01:12:42.438 --> 01:12:45.823
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm mostly excited about this one.

01:12:46.564 --> 01:12:56.939
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I said that I was trying to finish up Secret of the Spires before the movie came out, is that there is going to be new DLC for Avatar Frontiers of Pandora.

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.303
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, I freaking love that game.

01:12:59.483 --> 01:13:00.905
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.

01:13:00.925 --> 01:13:02.447
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.

01:13:03.008 --> 01:13:10.960
[SPEAKER_01]: But this game, this DLC is going to happen immediately after Fire and Ash.

01:13:11.817 --> 01:13:17.345
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to play as... This is the part that doesn't make me happy.

01:13:17.445 --> 01:13:22.653
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play as my character, my side-into character that I've been playing since the beginning of the damn game.

01:13:22.673 --> 01:13:30.325
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead you play as Sotlek, who is the person who rescues you at the start of the game, who helps guide you out of the place.

01:13:31.226 --> 01:13:36.414
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had his own comic and other stuff going on.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:40.440
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a great character, don't get me wrong, but

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:57.687
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to play my character.

01:13:58.645 --> 01:14:00.508
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is really cool.

01:14:00.588 --> 01:14:15.051
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a new collectible that's on its way out.

01:14:15.031 --> 01:14:27.169
[SPEAKER_05]: The Definitive Visual Chronicle of Sony's World-Changing Video Game Console, marking its 30th anniversary with unprecedented access to the archive of R&D prototypes, concept sketches, and developmental models.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:39.927
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, if you start to look through some of the pages that are out there of the book, you actually see that, and I don't even know what some of these are supposed to be, if this is actually what the PlayStation system concept might have looked like in the beginning, because that's kind of what it looks like.

01:14:39.947 --> 01:14:41.730
[SPEAKER_05]: Those might be controller ports in the front.

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.896
[SPEAKER_05]: or if we actually have maybe some early controller prototypes.

01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:48.019
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of these have been out there.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:55.110
[SPEAKER_05]: This first one looks familiar to me that maybe you've seen before, but it's kind of interesting to see these captured in photo form.

01:14:55.451 --> 01:14:58.876
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what this thing we're looking at on the stream is supposed to be.

01:14:59.437 --> 01:15:01.660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the analog stick.

01:15:02.163 --> 01:15:03.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's like the transparent.

01:15:04.186 --> 01:15:05.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I get it.

01:15:05.208 --> 01:15:07.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's just that taken out of... I'm like, what is this?

01:15:07.471 --> 01:15:08.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like a plunger?

01:15:08.733 --> 01:15:12.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, that's... It's a very different look at the analog stick.

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:15.783
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of different types of photographs and it looks really cool.

01:15:16.164 --> 01:15:17.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing, though.

01:15:17.426 --> 01:15:22.233
[SPEAKER_05]: This book is going to cost you $125 for the standard edition.

01:15:22.734 --> 01:15:23.715
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

01:15:23.695 --> 01:15:48.522
[SPEAKER_05]: it's 400 pages and it does sound like this is like a collectible photography book this is the nice book that's on the coffee table or your version of it this is the nice book in a prominent place in your game room or on your bookshelf it's that kind of book this is a fancy book this is the fancy china we don't eat off it every day okay so this is you know a pretty cool book for you know gaming collectors a

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:51.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, this felt like the thing that would be right up your alley to me, honestly.

01:15:52.107 --> 01:15:54.571
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you could appreciate this.

01:15:54.912 --> 01:15:56.634
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy about it.

01:15:56.694 --> 01:16:00.320
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be great, but it's nothing that's in my budget for now.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:02.783
[SPEAKER_05]: It is something to consider.

01:16:02.803 --> 01:16:12.998
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have an even bigger budget, I should mention there is a deluxe edition, $325, limited to 1,994 copies.

01:16:13.018 --> 01:16:14.080
[SPEAKER_05]: 1994, haha.

01:16:14.741 --> 01:16:16.804
[SPEAKER_05]: It includes the book,

01:16:16.784 --> 01:16:27.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Exposed Binding, A Clamshell Presentation Box, and Exclusive Prints.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.404
[SPEAKER_05]: So something a little extra special.

01:16:31.105 --> 01:16:33.649
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what bookbinding looks like.

01:16:33.749 --> 01:16:35.591
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather have my binding protected.

01:16:35.631 --> 01:16:35.952
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

01:16:35.972 --> 01:16:38.415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very stylish choice.

01:16:38.996 --> 01:16:42.381
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a book you really don't take out and read on the toilet.

01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:44.985

01:18:20.711 --> 01:18:25.218
[SPEAKER_01]: L-A-P-P-I-N Oh wow, I wonder if it's about the original thief.

01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:27.361
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

01:18:27.401 --> 01:18:28.182
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:18:29.464 --> 01:18:29.925
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:18:30.045 --> 01:18:34.071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game that doesn't look like anything that has to do with that.

01:18:34.472 --> 01:18:38.918
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like really creepy looking bunny things.

01:18:39.038 --> 01:18:41.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Lappin means rabbit.

01:18:42.297 --> 01:18:49.587

01:19:01.983 --> 01:19:05.748
[SPEAKER_04]: What will happen when these five rabbits go on their adventure?

01:19:05.969 --> 01:19:07.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... It looks cute.

01:19:08.773 --> 01:19:09.874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rabbits.

01:19:11.153 --> 01:19:13.336
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not raving or rabid.

01:19:13.856 --> 01:19:16.399
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't know what to think about that.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:29.234

01:22:07.274 --> 01:22:08.836
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few big tentpoles there.

01:22:09.677 --> 01:22:12.820
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of other stuff at this time.

01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:14.442

[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you have some happy gaming coming up in your near future.

01:24:07.846 --> 01:24:09.628
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting towards the end of the show here.

01:24:09.869 --> 01:24:16.758
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually at the end of the show, we would open up for the listener roundtable where we take your comments and we take your emails.

01:24:16.878 --> 01:24:21.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to discourage you from emailing the show, participate at orangelaunchradio.com or you can...

01:24:21.704 --> 01:24:26.572
[SPEAKER_05]: or interact with us on social media if you want over at bluesky at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:24:26.672 --> 01:24:29.096
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we always take your comments in chat.

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:33.564
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is something we actually wanted to bring to you guys tonight in this segment.

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:39.053
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually wasn't sure if we were going to talk about this tonight, but I think we are going to.

01:24:39.113 --> 01:24:41.637
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time to bring this up.

01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:58.274
[SPEAKER_05]: because, you know, this show was kind of conceived in this roundtable format of folks that are having, you know, dinner after a long day of gaming, whether it's DDR as we were playing back in the day or other games.

01:24:58.294 --> 01:25:06.483
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it's kind of sitting around and, you know, talking about our favorite pastime, which is playing video games and all the other nerdy things that we enjoy.

01:25:06.523 --> 01:25:09.666
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that roundtable that we're all at.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:19.321
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is probably an important point for me to let you know and bring to this roundtable that I've asked to leave this show.

01:25:19.883 --> 01:25:21.850
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

01:25:23.281 --> 01:25:30.451
[SPEAKER_05]: After 23 years, I'm going to be leaving this show at the end of November, on November 23rd to be exact.

01:25:30.471 --> 01:25:35.138
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sorry, there's really no easy way to state this kind of news.

01:25:35.178 --> 01:25:42.949
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure some of you are going to be very, very blindsided and surprised and shocked at this news.

01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:46.354
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish I had a better or easier way of kind of putting it.

01:25:47.515 --> 01:25:49.558
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is that

01:25:49.538 --> 01:25:54.925
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of said a long time ago that when things stop being fun in this space,

01:25:55.630 --> 01:26:22.093
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

01:26:22.597 --> 01:26:43.002
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's other elements in my life I guess I shouldn't say that like I'm not a fan of gaming I'm always going to be a fan of video games but maybe I don't wish to continue spending every Sunday night talking about an industry that I'm just watching continue to shoot itself in the foot and

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:58.864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:26:59.232 --> 01:27:00.914
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm breaking up the band, right?

01:27:00.975 --> 01:27:03.258
[SPEAKER_05]: That I'm, you know, causing this whole thing.

01:27:03.278 --> 01:27:03.939
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Yoko.

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:08.646
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well... But, you know, it's... I had to make the joke.

01:27:08.746 --> 01:27:09.147
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, no.

01:27:09.187 --> 01:27:09.968
[SPEAKER_05]: And you should.

01:27:10.008 --> 01:27:10.749
[SPEAKER_05]: We should make jokes.

01:27:10.989 --> 01:27:18.240
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's one of those things where it's like, I have no easier way to put it than sometimes you recognize it's time.

01:27:19.582 --> 01:27:22.186
[SPEAKER_05]: And after 23 and a half years, I think I recognize it's time.

01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:25.831
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean... I want to be very clear.

01:27:26.172 --> 01:27:28.395
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not doing this to...

01:27:29.253 --> 01:27:30.655
[SPEAKER_05]: Start an OLR 2.0.

01:27:31.196 --> 01:27:31.857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not it.

01:27:32.337 --> 01:27:34.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I continue to talk about games?

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.001
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

01:27:36.023 --> 01:27:37.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that's kind of hard to think about right now.

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:41.630
[SPEAKER_05]: But not in this weekly sort of space.

01:27:41.851 --> 01:27:47.999
[SPEAKER_05]: I think TikTok, YouTube, somewhere in a future media type of thing.

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.746
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this spending multiple hours of a Sunday...

01:27:53.384 --> 01:28:05.773
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:28:07.188 --> 01:28:12.533
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop This, which is obviously a hard thing to bring up.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:20.161
[SPEAKER_05]: But Loki, I know we talked about it, and I believe you've come to a similar conclusion, right?

01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:23.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I've basically come to a similar conclusion as well.

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:32.233
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to be excited about a gaming industry that's just constantly in this kind of turmoil and politics and everything with...

01:28:32.213 --> 01:28:33.254
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?

01:28:33.355 --> 01:28:37.580
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a time back when we were just really excited and positive about the gaming industry.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:42.827
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like every week they were just talking about something negative with that.

01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:51.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas this show could continue on forever, does that really make sense to do that?

01:28:51.619 --> 01:28:53.963
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

01:28:53.983 --> 01:29:01.613
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already been awarded an award for the longest running gaming podcast.

01:29:02.082 --> 01:29:06.528
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure, it could keep going, but at what point are we really enjoying it?

01:29:06.628 --> 01:29:10.193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of more of going through the motions with some of that stuff.

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:21.069
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like my energy right now is better focused on trying to grow my community with the Minecraft stuff that I've been doing.

01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:24.293
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been literally pouring all the hours and

01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:48.120
[SPEAKER_04]: any additional hours I have even during work hours sometimes into to try to like get that you know more feasible and growing whereas you know certainly I love this audience I love all the community that we've you know that have come and left and during the entire time that we've been doing this but like it's just it's

01:29:48.455 --> 01:30:12.893
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard it's hard to like stay positive about it and like be excited about it instead of just feel like I'm just regurgitating what I'm reading in the news am I really adding anything on top of that anymore like I've been out of the game industry for like a long time now so it doesn't feel like I even have that kind of like well here's you know the insider look at this you know type of stuff it's I don't know like how many more weeks are we gonna go where it's like hey look

01:30:14.037 --> 01:30:15.699
[SPEAKER_04]: The game industry is worse now.

01:30:16.199 --> 01:30:16.940
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more layoffs.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:17.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:19.242
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that Microsoft story we just talked about?

01:30:19.262 --> 01:30:21.624
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably more layoffs coming in 2026 as well.

01:30:21.704 --> 01:30:26.248
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, along with that, it's just going to be more of this.

01:30:26.288 --> 01:30:31.093
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there's going to be, like, indie studios, and I'm sure there's going to be games that are going to come out that we can be excited about.

01:30:31.113 --> 01:30:33.875
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also be excited about that without having to talk about it every single week.

01:30:34.536 --> 01:30:37.659
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's tough.

01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:42.323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, in one hand, like, you want to keep it going forever, but, like,

01:30:43.602 --> 01:30:49.794
[SPEAKER_04]: In the back of your mind, at least for me, it's like, am I really utilizing this time as best I can?

01:30:49.834 --> 01:30:51.217
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 45 years old.

01:30:51.477 --> 01:30:56.126
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of time left.

01:30:56.146 --> 01:31:01.697
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got like half your life, but it's the later half of your life already.

01:31:01.777 --> 01:31:04.041
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I don't know.

01:31:05.422 --> 01:31:11.270
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, Jamie, I want to turn it over to you because you have kind of taken this news... Because I'm a stubborn, spiteful bitch.

01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:14.514
[SPEAKER_05]: You have taken this news in a different direction, and I want to turn it over to you.

01:31:15.115 --> 01:31:15.676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quitting.

01:31:16.857 --> 01:31:17.518
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep going.

01:31:17.979 --> 01:31:32.678
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making arrangements with certain people who know who they are to birth something messy and sticky and tentacly from... It's an afterbirth.

01:31:32.879 --> 01:31:33.960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an afterbirth.

01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:38.955
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working through some details.

01:31:38.975 --> 01:31:41.818
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying that guy's going to get his way in the afterburst coming back?

01:31:41.858 --> 01:31:43.880
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy that left.

01:31:46.803 --> 01:31:47.884
[SPEAKER_01]: Cage match, cage match.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:49.145
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind.

01:31:52.209 --> 01:31:54.431
[SPEAKER_01]: We're floating names around.

01:31:54.771 --> 01:31:57.434
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of them I might need to get okay.

01:31:57.534 --> 01:32:00.377
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them thrown up was OLR2ElectricBoogaloo.

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:01.939
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:05.755
[SPEAKER_01]: You vote for Gay Bar.

01:32:06.235 --> 01:32:07.497
[SPEAKER_01]: Gay Bar is our new theme song.

01:32:07.517 --> 01:32:08.038
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

01:32:08.418 --> 01:32:17.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is a good thing to be able to be transparent in this part of the process is that you don't know if you want to call it Orange Lounge Radio or not, if I'm not mistaken.

01:32:17.972 --> 01:32:18.693
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're not.

01:32:18.994 --> 01:32:19.715
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're not.

01:32:19.835 --> 01:32:21.577
[SPEAKER_05]: I was making a joke.

01:32:22.238 --> 01:32:27.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Then Orange Lounge Radio, as we know it, will conclude on the 23rd of November.

01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:38.946
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:32:40.934 --> 01:33:00.057
[SPEAKER_05]: so far so far so there's still some things to do I mean what else the fuck am I doing on Sunday night here's the thing crocheting it's important to be transparent about this a little bit because that way Jamie is on her way to TwitchCon in two weeks she has the freedom now to talk about this because you all have heard it from us first

01:33:00.037 --> 01:33:13.503
[SPEAKER_05]: She has now the freedom to talk about this with whoever she wants and whatever potential collaborators there might be in the future and so forth and figure out what those next steps are going to look like before 23rd November, which is when that will be episode 1070.

01:33:13.904 --> 01:33:18.613
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about episode 1069, but I didn't want to base it on numerology.

01:33:18.633 --> 01:33:22.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to base it on this is the day and that's it.

01:33:22.801 --> 01:33:38.818
[SPEAKER_05]: that's an excellent question Mike Deft Mike Deft says I think the other question is what will Rob's involvement in VOG be I do still plan to be around with VOG I just think what my contribution is to VOG looks very different than what it does today

01:33:38.798 --> 01:33:43.346
[SPEAKER_05]: My gut, I think, honestly, you know what I'm doing is I'm giving myself a vacation.

01:33:44.187 --> 01:33:50.959
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think maybe next year, I might start to think about that roundtable concept that's kind of been on again, off again.

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:58.832
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I sort of see a future because I'm going to tell you the most important part of that roundtable concept, they were flexible.

01:33:58.812 --> 01:34:03.717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:34:05.799 --> 01:34:25.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:34:25.357 --> 01:34:40.108
[SPEAKER_05]: is part of it I want to take more long weekend trips yes is part of it there are things that happen on Sundays I have not done in 20 years yes is part of it um that um damn I lost my train of thought um

01:34:40.662 --> 01:34:41.283
[SPEAKER_05]: is part of it.

01:34:41.303 --> 01:34:46.687
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the fact that live hosting has really picked up for me since COVID.

01:34:46.707 --> 01:34:50.731
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have had to say no to gigs on Sunday night because of this show.

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:53.013
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something that now will be opened up for me.

01:34:53.033 --> 01:34:57.337
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a part of my life that I have really enjoyed exploring and being a part of.

01:34:57.477 --> 01:35:10.669
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, that is all factoring into it too, is that this allows me to potentially pick up other conventions or other shows on Sunday night, like live shows, not internet podcasts and things like that.

01:35:10.649 --> 01:35:14.214
[SPEAKER_05]: Short answer, Deft, I will still be involved with VOG.

01:35:15.095 --> 01:35:17.819
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing we have said tonight affects Bobby Blackwolf.

01:35:18.159 --> 01:35:21.403
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for him to talk about when he's ready.

01:35:22.205 --> 01:35:25.950
[SPEAKER_05]: If his show goes longer or what he's going to do.

01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.712
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Bobby's thing.

01:35:28.413 --> 01:35:31.978
[SPEAKER_05]: He is aware of this, except I don't think he knew we were going to do it tonight.

01:35:32.739 --> 01:35:33.460
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is what it is.

01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:38.867
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will still continue to be a VOG.

01:35:38.847 --> 01:36:02.914
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

01:36:04.396 --> 01:36:06.302
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck to Jamie and her team with that.

01:36:06.362 --> 01:36:15.412
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it is cool that you're going to keep it going, especially for the folks that are here on Sundays and have been a part of this little family for so long.

01:36:15.432 --> 01:36:17.258
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad there can be something.

01:36:17.609 --> 01:36:40.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, DarkSakura!

01:36:39.985 --> 01:37:02.837
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:29.280
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggested earlier that we have this out now because I'd like to hear what people have to say if we don't get spam email that is so I want to give people a week to process while we're fresh here to say things and then before I go to TwitchCon

01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:34.374
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to rule out either, but I want to be very careful how I walk this line.

01:37:34.714 --> 01:37:39.659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to rule out the potential that the three of us can reunite for other things.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Preserving the friendship with Loki and Jamie is the most important thing to me out of all of this, of course.

01:37:45.905 --> 01:37:46.826
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it was ever at risk.

01:37:46.846 --> 01:37:49.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still going to get memes from me all the time?

01:37:49.088 --> 01:37:59.318
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and not that any of that was ever at risk, but I'm just saying that I do see a situation where the three of us can still come together once in a while to talk about some big things.

01:37:59.298 --> 01:38:26.655
[SPEAKER_05]: and but is that going to be every week no is that going to be you know it's spontaneous as we're able to make it happen sure you know like if Jamie's willing amongst her new project as well and Loki amongst everything he's working on and so forth like absolutely that's something so I but I don't also don't want to give false hope you know that's that's why I'm saying it's a tricky line right I don't want to be like but it's not really over because we'll still get together once in a

01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:30.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Ones Radio, as you know it, is going to be done on November 23rd.

01:38:31.777 --> 01:38:33.760
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully the future won't be so bad.

01:38:34.281 --> 01:38:34.861
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

01:38:35.022 --> 01:38:37.986
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be okay, right?

01:38:38.006 --> 01:38:41.350
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob made a good point earlier about all of us developing our other things.

01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:44.554
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just another podcast.

01:38:44.574 --> 01:38:47.078
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been floating another podcast idea for a while.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:51.664
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a Dead by Daylight machinima kind of thing.

01:38:52.345 --> 01:38:55.249
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also trying to grow my own channel.

01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:59.262
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy streaming.

01:39:00.244 --> 01:39:02.126
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy having people there to interact with.

01:39:02.226 --> 01:39:03.648
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love one day to be partner.

01:39:04.349 --> 01:39:06.472
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that would just be absolutely tremendous.

01:39:07.473 --> 01:39:19.288
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been doing this every Sunday, and I like being out there and loud and talking shit.

01:39:20.315 --> 01:39:34.074
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that there is still an opportunity to give the alternative view on what happens not just in gaming but I mean geek culture in general.

01:39:34.595 --> 01:39:47.233
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a big opportunity for that to specifically speak on how they all interact together and also to speak out against the injustices going on in the world because they're affecting all of us.

01:39:47.213 --> 01:39:57.796
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we like video games and we might be into anime and we might like Doctor Who or watching these shows does not mean we do not have a serious opinion.

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:01.263
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to keep that going.

01:40:01.283 --> 01:40:03.889
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rinmari, I adore you and...

01:40:04.392 --> 01:40:08.458
[SPEAKER_01]: and yeah, you came over and you've been through a lot with us.

01:40:08.538 --> 01:40:09.840
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have been through some shit.

01:40:10.161 --> 01:40:23.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I also kind of like looking at this as sort of an evolution and there was a point, you know, there's a couple of points really when OLR evolved, you know, we were a show about Bomani exclusively and we sort of hit a reset button at one point with that.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.623
[SPEAKER_05]: to be really about games.

01:40:25.663 --> 01:40:31.330
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was also part of this whole merging podcasting with what we were doing all the way back on Live 365 and all that.

01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:33.713
[SPEAKER_05]: This show has been through a few changes.

01:40:34.234 --> 01:40:40.762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love what you're saying there, Jamie, about maybe really looking at the voice of geeks being about geeks now.

01:40:40.903 --> 01:40:45.148
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're bringing to this being about...

01:40:45.128 --> 01:41:04.774
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else that's not just video games sure that's part of it but everything else as well and based on who I am aware you're talking to I think you're talking to all the right people for that sort of project so it sounds very exciting so sorry to be one of those people was the first person I reached out to do not say who you are

01:41:04.754 --> 01:41:09.259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so there's... Yeah, some more to come on that.

01:41:09.279 --> 01:41:19.810
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to call out the chat comment, and actually this has been raised a couple times, but TravisC78 in chat says, sucks to hear, but much respect for calling on your own terms.

01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:23.714
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of you have actually used that, your own terms, going on your own terms.

01:41:24.134 --> 01:41:31.622
[SPEAKER_05]: That is absolutely a huge part of this decision, is wanting to do this...

01:41:31.602 --> 01:41:33.745
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's something that's under our control.

01:41:33.765 --> 01:41:35.748
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we've had scares in the past.

01:41:36.489 --> 01:41:39.153
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it might have been something that wasn't part of our control.

01:41:41.857 --> 01:41:45.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to be too dark, but I had a near-death experience when I was 29.

01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:47.364
[SPEAKER_05]: And this show was on at that time.

01:41:47.805 --> 01:41:51.931
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there have been some very sombering moments that make us go, shit.

01:41:51.951 --> 01:41:53.213
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have gotten married.

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.615
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, very true.

01:41:55.256 --> 01:41:56.357
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

01:41:57.138 --> 01:41:57.559
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

01:41:58.602 --> 01:41:59.424
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

01:41:59.444 --> 01:42:00.286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big news.

01:42:00.707 --> 01:42:06.579
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there was not a lot of warning about that.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:15.919
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think those of you that are here, because I do feel like it is possible that some people's ears are going to perk up about a

01:42:15.899 --> 01:42:23.128
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 plus long year running podcast deciding to close its doors to open different doors somewhere else.

01:42:24.469 --> 01:42:32.439
[SPEAKER_05]: But we wanted you all that are here week after week and on the podcast feed to be able to hear this from us first.

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:40.168
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to say for the people who noticed I had been really out of sorts over the last few weeks, this is why.

01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:50.343
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I couldn't say anything, but this is... I'm in the place of numbness right now.

01:42:51.906 --> 01:42:56.172
[SPEAKER_01]: Where my brain just sort of goes right over it and just starts thinking about future things.

01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:59.677
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

01:43:00.138 --> 01:43:02.621
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm... I'm okay.

01:43:02.641 --> 01:43:02.742
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:43:06.407 --> 01:43:07.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

01:43:07.503 --> 01:43:09.588
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the okayest pig main on Twitch right now.

01:43:09.828 --> 01:43:10.249
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:16.584
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as what the future shows look like, it's business as usual through the 23rd of November.

01:43:16.604 --> 01:43:18.829
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a show I'm missing.

01:43:19.079 --> 01:43:22.966
[SPEAKER_05]: Which will be dark that night, October 26th.

01:43:23.347 --> 01:43:24.308
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no show.

01:43:24.489 --> 01:43:27.434
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a work-based situation that I cannot control.

01:43:28.897 --> 01:43:31.642
[SPEAKER_05]: This or not this, I would not be here October 26th.

01:43:32.002 --> 01:43:37.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie will not be here the week before due to TwitchCon, but otherwise it's business as usual.

01:43:38.093 --> 01:43:43.483
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as the last show goes, we're not ones to pull a lot of stunts.

01:43:45.303 --> 01:43:51.276
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can expect it will be as you've come to expect right up until the very end.

01:43:52.679 --> 01:43:55.084
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm open to all ideas.

01:43:55.104 --> 01:43:56.467
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few weeks to figure it out.

01:43:59.213 --> 01:43:59.594
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:44:00.616 --> 01:44:02.601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the dollar, Fifth Dream.

01:44:02.621 --> 01:44:02.721
Yeah.

01:44:03.342 --> 01:44:32.185
[SPEAKER_05]: um with that um I know that's a heavy beast of information but you know hopefully everybody has some time to process we can talk about a little more next week if you want um and you know through these last few weeks I imagine we may see a few uh faces from the past pulling through one more time um and uh yeah um Matt I'll check in quickly see if there's any last minute stories but otherwise I think that's probably a good note for us to just exit stage right on um

01:44:33.008 --> 01:44:33.388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:44:34.029 --> 01:44:38.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Then why do I go around and say, thank you for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

01:44:38.555 --> 01:44:41.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your support over the last few years.

01:44:41.199 --> 01:44:43.782
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually had a spiel here at the end.

01:44:43.822 --> 01:44:48.648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that spiel is going to change a little bit here towards the end and just say- So long and thanks for all the fish.

01:44:48.788 --> 01:44:54.856
[SPEAKER_05]: No, truly, thank you for all your support over these last 23 and a half years and over a thousand episodes.

01:44:55.097 --> 01:44:56.959
[SPEAKER_05]: You all have kept us going.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:57.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I

01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.862
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:05.473
[SPEAKER_05]: When I thought there was no gas in the tank, you all were the reasons the show still kept going as long as it has.

01:45:06.014 --> 01:45:09.960
[SPEAKER_05]: This world record run was not achievable without you all.

01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:12.023
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for your support over the years.

01:45:12.043 --> 01:45:13.085
[SPEAKER_05]: It means everything to us.

01:45:13.626 --> 01:45:18.474
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be here at VOG Network every Sunday night throughout the 23rd of November, minus that one exception I talked about.

01:45:19.395 --> 01:45:20.798
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all so much.

01:45:20.818 --> 01:45:21.499
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope to see you.

01:45:21.519 --> 01:45:24.784
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope you'll see this out to the bitter end with us.

01:45:24.764 --> 01:45:27.790
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, DarkSakura, your final thought.

01:45:28.732 --> 01:45:30.094
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the end's going to be bitter.

01:45:31.918 --> 01:45:32.519
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

01:45:32.599 --> 01:45:34.363
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be tart.

01:45:35.225 --> 01:45:43.360
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be waffles involved and maybe some booze and a lot of saying fuck.

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:43.681
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

01:45:43.761 --> 01:45:44.523
[SPEAKER_01]: I ordered Malort.

01:45:44.583 --> 01:45:45.705
[SPEAKER_01]: Pray for me.

01:45:45.725 --> 01:45:46.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

01:45:46.186 --> 01:45:47.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had Malort?

01:45:48.001 --> 01:45:54.554
[SPEAKER_01]: No, apparently it tastes like stomach acid and a million years of regret.

01:45:54.575 --> 01:46:00.787
[SPEAKER_05]: The Chicago Ingress players make it a big fucking deal at all the events that if you haven't been malorted, you've got to.

01:46:00.807 --> 01:46:02.090
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've had my share of malort.

01:46:02.491 --> 01:46:03.874
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing.

01:46:03.894 --> 01:46:05.517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saving it for something.

01:46:05.537 --> 01:46:07.000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Beverly of alcohol.

01:46:09.305 --> 01:46:09.385
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

01:46:10.563 --> 01:46:11.204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I've got.

01:46:11.624 --> 01:46:14.889
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm saving it for something post-TwitchCon.

01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:46:15.650 --> 01:46:16.071
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

01:46:16.151 --> 01:46:16.832
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

01:46:16.852 --> 01:46:17.633
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:46:17.993 --> 01:46:19.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're streaming tonight, we'll see you in a little bit then.

01:46:19.916 --> 01:46:20.056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

01:46:20.116 --> 01:46:20.797
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

01:46:20.817 --> 01:46:21.598
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Pallia night.

01:46:21.678 --> 01:46:25.684
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured we need some Pallia tonight instead of the Debbies.

01:46:25.704 --> 01:46:29.469
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go for cozy.

01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:32.613
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might cry in my stream.

01:46:32.974 --> 01:46:33.314
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

01:46:34.356 --> 01:46:34.756
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

01:46:34.796 --> 01:46:36.098
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean has an excellent question.

01:46:36.178 --> 01:46:39.523
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen to the voiceover guy in the beginning of the show?

01:46:40.786 --> 01:46:42.609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

01:46:42.729 --> 01:46:49.479
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason would love for you to... Wherever there is voiceover work needed... Do you want to be our voiceover guy?

01:46:51.462 --> 01:46:55.128
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say if ever I have voiceover needs, Jason will still be the first guy I call.

01:46:55.829 --> 01:46:57.792
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my quick answer to that question.

01:46:57.892 --> 01:47:05.443
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will save some of this for when we're ready to be done on the final night.

01:47:05.423 --> 01:47:32.595
[SPEAKER_05]: you wouldn't have had this show for a thousand of these 1064 episodes if it wasn't for Jason and I know he's not visible on this show as much there was a stretch there where we had a lot of Jason on this show which was great but trust you may not hear him outside those voiceovers at the beginning and the end there would be no OLR if it wasn't for Jason this entire time so one of the biggest thank yous in the room goes to VXJasonXV so

01:47:33.065 --> 01:47:56.676
[SPEAKER_05]: he's got a we gave him a spoon so he can dig his way out of the basement, fifth stream fifth stream said let him out of the basement before you go alright Jamie, go start your stream before we get out too much of the final final stuff when we're not ready yet, bye alright, Loki, we're going to you your final thought tonight speaking of bittersweet Tron Ares week

01:48:01.617 --> 01:48:30.072
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next week, goodnight.

01:48:32.887 --> 01:48:35.411
