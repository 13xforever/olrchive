1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,591
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do, Ken?

2
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:18,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like one of your teriyaki burgers with egg, a sweet and sour fried chicken, a triple cheeseburger, and an overflowing energy McFizz.

3
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:19,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have all that to go?

4
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:21,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure you can.

5
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Puns with poor propunciation.

6
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:28,275
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not sorry.

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:34,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's time for your hosts, Robert Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about the story behind this skit and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting right now with a show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:41,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:45,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:49,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently you get dad jokes from our voiceover guy, Jason.

12
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:51,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:51,844 --> 00:01:00,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We are back once again tonight with episode number 1066 of our show for October the 19th of 2025.

14

15
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for much longer though.

16
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:18,389
[SPEAKER_05]: November 23rd is when we're going to be ending the 23 and a year, 23 and a half year run of this show.

17
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Very bittersweet but excited for what might be in the future.

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:51,544
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

22
00:02:55,548 --> 00:03:01,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's no one better here at Orange Launch Radio to bring on the show to talk about this than the one and only Shane.

23
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

24
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:03,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

25
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Live all the way from New Zealand, right?

26
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:10,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, currently for another eight, eight, seven days.

27
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So you you did it.

28
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:18,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people talk about getting the hell out of the US with everything going on and you're living the dream.

29
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:20,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to live the dream.

30
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not.

31
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:40,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, fully there yet, but I'm working on it.

32
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:43,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I never went by my first name.

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated my first name.

34
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:46,244
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously not Shane.

35
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:48,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is something you and I have in common.

36
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I, I don't know how many listeners know this.

37
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is my middle name.

38
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't go by my legal name ever.

39
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

40
00:03:55,477 --> 00:04:03,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I had this opportunity come up where I was supposed to move to Germany.

41
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what, let's just get rid of my first name and get something cool.

42
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:08,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And

43
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:30,220
[SPEAKER_01]: at my now old job we were talking about like names I could go with and I picked Seeger and got it you know legalized and everything went through the process it was annoying and then Germany fell through so now I just have a German first name even though I'm not German so whatever whatever it's fine it's fine

44
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:35,412
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, but just to be clear, people can still call you Shane.

45
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, honestly, either one works.

46
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:44,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas before, I would not talk to you ever again had you called me my first name.

47
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whoever you're comfortable with is fine.

48
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in my case, he'd just give it right back, and then we both hate each other, so...

49
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:51,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there you go.

50
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:52,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

51
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay.

52
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon.

53
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,024
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a Pokemon fan.

54
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:08,577
[SPEAKER_05]: For our newer listeners, you know, if we have any, tell us about why you love Pokemon and kind of like what your love of the franchise sort of stems from.

55
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,643
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really deep question.

56
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:17,094
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of hard to articulate because I don't fully know the answer.

57
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:24,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say that I think the games are just fun, like just on a very basic level.

58
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:24,561
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

59
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games ought to be fun, huh?

60
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:33,651
[SPEAKER_01]: They also scratch this itch I have of like hunting and collecting things.

61
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:37,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as a kid, I'd go with my mom beanie baby hunting.

62
00:05:37,175 --> 00:05:38,296
[SPEAKER_01]: That was super fun to me.

63
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,318
[SPEAKER_01]: We would do that for other toys and stuff.

64
00:05:40,754 --> 00:06:08,618
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is the objective of Pokemon so it's just a really good time for me and I like the designs I think the gameplay has always been good to solid so so Pokemon is just like Beanie Babies confirmed yes 100% easy okay um let's see so you there's kind of an infamous meme on this show about you and maybe it's Labubu's now actually are you into the Labubu thing

65
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:16,522
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I hate them, and I didn't really know what they were until when I was in Japan a couple months ago.

66
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,226
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend called me and asked me to find her some, like, why?

67
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:30,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after she said that, literally everywhere I go, I see Labubus, and I hate it, and they're so weird, and they're not cute.

68
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they remind me of, was it Where the Wild Things Are?

69
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of.

70
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, why are they making dolls of those?

71
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:39,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see that.

72
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: The only Labubu I'm interested in is one I saw on TikTok today that was a sculpture that was entirely made out of bread.

73
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,251
[SPEAKER_05]: It was LaCarbCarb, and I am so into that.

74
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds amazing.

75
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:56,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be a Labubu racist, but they all look the same.

76
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not even know what the differences are.

77
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:00,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

78
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there different ones?

79
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they sure don't look like it.

80
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know my husband is really into the blind boxes, but not the labubus.

81
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:15,624
[SPEAKER_05]: But he likes to go to the pop mart and stuff and just kind of look around.

82
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,650
[SPEAKER_05]: He likes some of that type of stuff, but not labubus, thankfully.

83
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:23,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to go off on that tangent.

84
00:07:24,248 --> 00:07:25,889
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you were saying about something else.

85
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're fine, you're fine.

86
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:41,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was going to say the meme about you on this show is that you, so like when Pokemon, I don't know what it was, it was X or Y or something came out, you bought like eight copies of the game because you have to, well, I actually don't know why.

87
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,386
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have them in every region, every pairing.

88
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

89
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

90
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,628
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

91
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's clear that up.

92
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,911
[SPEAKER_01]: So... It was six copies.

93
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:51,893
[SPEAKER_01]: The first, the first...

94
00:07:52,683 --> 00:08:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: of the generations I bought, like, multiple versions besides just, you know, the standard, like, red and blue or X and Y or whatever, was Gen 7.

95
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:13,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, funny enough, I was in New Zealand at the time, and I wanted to play the game.

96
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:18,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was on 3DS, and it launched here, and I was like, okay, I'm going to go get a copy.

97
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:18,808
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got

98
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,243
[SPEAKER_01]: copies here, and then I got copies back when I was in the US.

99
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:31,754
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until Sword and Shield that I went insane and just started buying copies from every region.

100
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:36,038
[SPEAKER_01]: When literally starting with Sword and Shield, it didn't matter anymore.

101
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:44,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas before, you'd have to buy a Japanese copy to play in Japanese, and so you could do the Masuda breeding.

102
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it doesn't matter yet.

103
00:08:47,982 --> 00:08:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time I've started buying way too many copies.

104
00:08:51,908 --> 00:09:03,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a brand new game come out this week, Pokemon Legends ZA, which, although technically not a mainline game, it does really feel like Pokemon Legends is an emerging mainline series.

105
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well, is that just because it ties into X and Y, or what?

106
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,999
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they said the Legends series is considered mainline.

107
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:15,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a terrible, terrible, like, false information game.

108
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:26,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

109
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,954
[SPEAKER_01]: The creators say they're mainlines.

110
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,376
[SPEAKER_05]: They can say whatever they want to sell more copies.

111
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:31,877
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

112
00:09:32,257 --> 00:09:40,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair, the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet obviously felt influenced by what they did with Pokemon Legends Arceus.

113
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's something there, I guess.

114
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about Pokemon Legends ZA.

115
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You obviously have jumped in.

116
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You have already beaten the game, correct?

117
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:56,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I marathoned the crap out of this because I came prepared.

118
00:09:56,883 --> 00:10:26,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the game digitally or pre-ordered it digitally while I was in Japan so I knew that I could start playing as soon as it went live on the Japanese servers and so I've been playing since what that would be my Wednesday my Wednesday no my Thursday early early morning which is your like Wednesday at some point in time I don't know

119
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:31,089
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I just kind of marathoned it, like, really bad.

120
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so how many hours did it take you to get through it?

121
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:41,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, considering I didn't finish the decks, but I did do every side mission I possibly saw.

122
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:46,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went around collecting the very gay screws.

123
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:51,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a lot of the Battle Royale stuff.

124
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:54,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended at 47 hours.

125
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but you did a lot of side missions and that's, you know, understandable.

126
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:03,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I did every side mission that popped up, yes.

127
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:06,811
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I like to play the games too, so that's not terribly surprising.

128
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I've played the game for a little bit.

129
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:13,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I streamed it the night it came out and then I've been playing more off stream.

130
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm up to rank, I don't know,

131
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:43,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think...

132
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:54,534
[SPEAKER_01]: In some weird way, Legends ZA captures the same addictive gameplay loop that Legends RCS does.

133
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Or has, rather.

134
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:10,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of going and just catching things constantly, the catch things in the daytime, and then when it switches over to night, going to the ZA battle stuff, that's just really fun.

135
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And it never overstays its welcome.

136
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:24,803
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm constantly angry when it does switch over to either day or night because I'm having a good time doing the activities it wants me to do during those time periods.

137
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,708
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually kind of one of the issues I have.

138
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like the day-night mechanic.

139
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

140
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it, but I just don't care for it.

141
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:47,205
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can also avoid it mostly you can use the benches yeah with the benches you still have to engage with the mechanic but you don't have to let it like control you the entire aspect of your gameplay

142
00:12:47,337 --> 00:13:10,528
[SPEAKER_05]: question from chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at twitch.tv slash VOG Network 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwolf show we won't be here next week but we'll be back in two weeks I'll tell you more about that later but YYR is live in our chat asking is that longer or shorter than the first Legends game?

143
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:16,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute since I started Legends from scratch I would say just guessing

144
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:27,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That this game is probably longer in the sense of start to finish if you're not doing like 100% completion.

145
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:33,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 47 sounds like a lot compared to Pokemon Legends or Saiyans.

146
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:36,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a very needed postgame.

147
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:43,002
[SPEAKER_01]: My 47 hours is closer to 100% completion playstyle.

148
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:50,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw people that beat this new game just rushing through it in under 20 hours.

149
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

150
00:13:52,863 --> 00:14:14,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't really answer if it's longer or shorter.

151
00:14:14,176 --> 00:14:16,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It's overhauled.

152
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: it's it well that's another reason to to it's weird to call it a mainline game but i suppose if this is what we're going to see in gen 10 as well then that's fine because i really like the combat system because it feels like like an action rpg now it feels like a i don't know like a kingdom hearts or a world of warcraft or something like they took the you know the four moves and they you know you you do them a little more like they have cooldowns and you use them live and it's it's interesting i really like it what how do you feel about the overhaul to the battle system

153
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love it.

154
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:51,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's so much more fun and far more engaging.

155
00:14:53,954 --> 00:15:03,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also fun because things you expect having played this series for so many years, like they just don't work the same.

156
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:10,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The moves that you know what they do in standard Pokemon games don't necessarily work the same way.

157
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Protect is a short shield that

158
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:25,547
[SPEAKER_01]: basically nothing can get through, but then it's on a cool down or toxic spikes used to be a trap where when new Pokemon would come in, they would be poisoned.

159
00:15:26,147 --> 00:15:37,264
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this game, you throw them on the ground and at any time your current or your current Pokemon or other ones you bring out could walk over them and get poisoned.

160
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:42,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you just stay far away, then you don't have to even deal with that trap.

161
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

162
00:15:43,273 --> 00:15:43,313
So

163
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:52,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting a really fun twist on the not boring, but the tried and true gameplay.

164
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:55,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's great.

165
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:59,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm pretty sure this is where you and I are going to disagree, and that's fine.

166
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:03,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we don't disagree all the time, but I just don't like the city setup.

167
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:03,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest.

168
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like the setting.

169
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:11,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like how they did the wild areas in the city, and I know you get more, and I've gotten to the point where I think I have 10 of them unlocked and stuff.

170
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like the setting.

171
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like climbing the rooftops.

172
00:16:15,196 --> 00:16:16,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like this.

173
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it doesn't...

174
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:21,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it feels very weird to me, especially compared to the last game.

175
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoyed the setting of the last game.

176
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:27,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there was a part of me that was just kind of yearning for more of that, to be quite honest.

177
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:34,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand, creatively, they gotta do different things to keep people interested in stuff, but I just don't like that creative direction.

178
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,687
[SPEAKER_05]: But you enjoy it more.

179
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:39,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 100%.

180
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:46,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that being in a city lets you do a lot more...

181
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,650
[SPEAKER_01]: focused activities.

182
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:59,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives the developers, I almost say, more freedom to do fun things because you're not just looking at some giant blank map.

183
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,943
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got structures you have to work around.

184
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:04,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the verticality.

185
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:15,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it does a very good job of being in a Pokemon world that feels lived in versus a Pokemon world that has

186
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:24,485
[SPEAKER_01]: What you would call a town, but literally is like two houses, but 10 people in that little village.

187
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it feel lived in though?

188
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I feel like there's a lot of stretches that are a little bit empty.

189
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:34,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's always like, oh, a cafe, another cafe, another cafe, another clothes shop.

190
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,324
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only so many.

191
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how it is in real life.

192
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:38,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there...

193
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:40,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's such a lame excuse.

194
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,124
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only so many archetypes of like actual things you find in the city.

195
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:47,108
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not a lot of variation in it.

196
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:47,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

197
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:56,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I thought what the game was doing, I thought it was doing like a Final Fantasy VII thing where like the first segment would take place in the city and then we get to like go outside the city.

198
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I found out that wasn't the case, I was kind of like, oh, well, that's kind of disappointing.

199
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just, yeah.

200
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all city, but there are some special places you do get to go.

201
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:15,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will get to, you know, break up the monotony of looking at buildings constantly.

202
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did they get rid of crafting?

203
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:22,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess it was the crafting system in the last game was very, very, very basic.

204
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I'm not going to say like, oh my God, it was so complex and I loved it.

205
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:38,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, I don't know, like it feels like all, when you run over these shiny things on the ground, not shiny Pokemon, but shiny little objects, they're all just like, they're either items you throw away in battle or things you sell for money.

206
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:41,990
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I felt like... Oh, crafting made sense for Legends Arceus.

207
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:46,096
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a time period where Pokeballs are not a thing, really.

208
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:50,422
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just starting to, you know, make them or they're being produced.

209
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:57,953
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this game, you know, this is actually the farthest ahead in the timeline we are for the Pokemon world.

210
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:02,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I don't know, crafting was kind of boring in the other game.

211
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,285
[SPEAKER_01]: All it did was, you know, give you access to like Pokeballs.

212
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:08,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you use it for.

213
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:14,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, go beat up some chumps in the Royale one night and you get, I'm getting like $150,000.

214
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:17,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just money on Pokeballs.

215
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

216
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like it's just, I don't know.

217
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:23,559
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I don't want to say lazy.

218
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Lazy is not the right word, but I don't know if like this, it's almost too streamlined.

219
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.

220
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too streamlined for me.

221
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:56,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know like again I don't dislike the game I'll finish it it's it's engaging enough but I was just kind of I don't know maybe I after the last Pokemon Legends game I just had the bar set a little higher you know I don't know but for me we didn't really have I mean all we had was Arceus so we don't really know what a Legends series looks like yet yeah but I do know that I liked Arceus when I first play it better than this one when I first played it that I do know

222
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:01,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Minus the graphics part.

223
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:06,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that part is nice that it runs really smooth at 60 frames a second and all that.

224
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:18,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I'm sure you've seen how critical some people are of some of the, I don't know, lack of three-dimensional texturing, we'll say, when it comes to some of those buildings and things of that.

225
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't...

226
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:25,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some people are being a little sensational when they call it copy-paste terrain and things like that.

227
00:20:25,668 --> 00:20:27,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it feels a little more alive than that.

228
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:35,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would agree that Game Freak feels behind a lot of their peers when it comes to pushing the envelope with graphics.

229
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:40,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I can agree with that.

230
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:43,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't agree with the people just constantly harping on it.

231
00:20:44,465 --> 00:20:49,510
[SPEAKER_01]: One, if you're harping on it, you saw the leaked budgets for these games.

232
00:20:49,709 --> 00:21:19,598
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of makes sense why it looks the way it does but also I don't think a flat textured building is going to take away from the fun I have with the game unless I have to like I don't know climb the building and only look at the building and that's all I do is just look at buildings the entire time which I don't in this game yeah they're the scenery but I'm looking at the ground I'm looking at the sky I'm in Pokemon battles those are

233
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

234
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:30,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very annoying to be a fan of almost anything now and just realize that

235
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:38,759
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be people out there that are going to make bad faith arguments and just be so loud about it when you just want to have fun with your game.

236
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:39,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem.

237
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to call it like it is.

238
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:41,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to call it like it is.

239
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: People use Pokemon for views.

240
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

241
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:51,111
[SPEAKER_05]: They are using Pokemon and its popularity to go on these tirades.

242
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:57,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw this video that was just like super negative on the whole thing today with 69,000 views.

243
00:21:57,057 --> 00:22:00,823
[SPEAKER_05]: That is like – and that's probably small fries and that stuff.

244
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's very – it's just wild to me.

245
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:04,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the people will shit on it.

246
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's because of the nature of algorithms and that somebody else controls your algorithm in almost all social media except for one, Blue Sky.

247
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:15,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Mastodon to be fair.

248
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:19,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's these algorithms.

249
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:23,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it keeps pushing you that negativity to rage bait you into engagement.

250
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

251
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:50,166
[SPEAKER_05]: that's literally what Elon Musk bought X to do was to turn it into rage bait engagement so yeah anyway let's see going to our comments in chat Deft in chat says I haven't played Z to A but the battles seem really cool now turn base for me for the most part is really boring hence why I like stuff like Mario RPG because it gives you something to do and I want Pokemon to look good the game can look whatever

252
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, and the Pokemon do look good.

253
00:22:54,093 --> 00:23:03,384
[SPEAKER_01]: They lack the really defined textures of the Scarlet Violet Pokemon, but they still look amazing.

254
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:14,397
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new Megas, which I won't spoil, literally probably the most... I think they're all great.

255
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:17,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all the new Megas are great, and...

256
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:20,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just leave it at that because I don't want to spoil things for people.

257
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifth Dream in chat is talking about I'm always a turn-based guy.

258
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I want that back.

259
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:28,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Real time is too hectic.

260
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any way to slow the battles down or do anything like if you...

261
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:34,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see that.

262
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:48,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when Final Fantasy XV made that change to action and because of all the feedback or whatever you want to call it, they actually added a mode in XV that would stop.

263
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:55,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it would stop the clock every time your cooldown reset so you had time to really think about your next move.

264
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:59,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XV kind of had that, but Pokemon Legends doesn't have anything like that, right?

265
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:25,999
[SPEAKER_01]: no you have to kind of think ahead um you can do stuff like make the other Pokemon drowsy or paralyze it or freeze it and that gives you some breathing room or and that's in battles in um or trainer battles if you're doing like wild battles if you need just like a minute to think toss out a couple Pokeballs at the Pokemon and even if it doesn't catch you still get

266
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:30,775
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of time to just kind of process, you know, what you want to do next.

267
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:33,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're going to rage at this comment.

268
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:33,920
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready, Shane?

269
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:39,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby in chat says, and that's why I'm glad the Legends series is a spinoff and not a mainline game.

270
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,615
[SPEAKER_05]: The mainline games can still be turn-based.

271
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:50,127
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I can see the steam coming out of your ears, I do want to go back to the point about, wait a minute, could the mainline games go this direction?

272
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:52,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think the mainline games are going to go this direction?

273
00:24:52,591 --> 00:25:02,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, Bobby's comment is clearly him just quoting something from a Ragebait video that is grounded in nonsense.

274
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Not grounded at all.

275
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:10,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, did you guys talk about the Pokemon leaks on the show?

276
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:11,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming up.

277
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually wanted to keep you around to talk about that.

278
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to get into that a little bit, yes.

279
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll touch on it for a second.

280
00:25:18,575 --> 00:25:22,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly in the leaks, the next generation...

281
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:28,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Gen 10 will have an option for turn-based or not turn-based.

282
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

283
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:39,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's the same as the action we're getting in this game or something completely different.

284
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's literally what Fifth Dream is asking for.

285
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:45,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting.

286
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:45,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

287
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:51,572
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Pokemon's in a weird place because

288
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:58,460
[SPEAKER_01]: This game was supposed to come out last year, and then this year would have been Gen 10.

289
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:02,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now they also have that other game coming out, Champions.

290
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:06,530
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where Competitive is going to be played now, is on Champions.

291
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:16,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So realistically, since Champions is just the turn-based 2v2 fights, and that's all,

292
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:30,576
[SPEAKER_01]: They could do whatever they wanted with any of the games from here on out because they've got their competitive game and that's what they care about for the turn-based style.

293
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:34,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifth Dream in chat says, Pokopia is the real future.

294
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,843
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about that one?

295
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:39,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everybody says Pokemon Minecraft.

296
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that's the wrong take.

297
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:45,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Dragon Quest Builders, that's the right take, at least from what we know so far.

298
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:50,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is Pokemon Dragon Quest Builders because it's made by the same team that made Dragon Quest Builders.

299
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize.

300
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:53,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually legit didn't realize that.

301
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:54,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that makes a lot of sense.

302
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

303
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:57,165
Hmm.

304
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:20,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah.

305
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:44,196
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

306
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:50,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is all from the huge leak that happened, was it last year?

307
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:51,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

308
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:55,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we got some data forms, lots of internal documents.

309
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:57,674
[SPEAKER_05]: This is way beyond rumor.

310
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:04,040
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like, it could change from the day it was leaked, but this is the direction it's going in.

311
00:28:05,442 --> 00:28:12,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and just to show how things can change, ZA was not a Kalos game to start with.

312
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,031
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

313
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:43,630
[SPEAKER_01]: that right there kind of shows you nothing is set in stone but I already forgot the question so I just like generally how do you feel how do you feel about the leaked things like with the direction that Pokemon's going when you read about that I'm fine I'm on board I have always been on board with the games it seems with the exception of a couple Gen 10 sounds promising but

314
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:52,541
[SPEAKER_01]: will have to see if they can deliver on the ambition that is in those documents.

315
00:28:53,302 --> 00:29:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: The next Legends game I am excited for, but I'm also very apprehensive because it's just yet another twist in the formula.

316
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I'm going to like that twist.

317
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:13,245
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be fair, going into ZA,

318
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:40,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if I would like the combat in this game with its huge focus and it's it's kind of like playing Hades for me or Hades 2 I get into a fight I go I go at night and I'm like okay I just want to do it one more time I want to go through the entire like area and go beat people up and I just oh I can't can't stop playing that but um

319
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:50,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for the Legends game just based on the region it's based because it sounds like it'll be more like the last Legends game, but it probably won't.

320
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:51,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to do its own thing, I'm sure.

321
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:54,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

322
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:55,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

323
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll have to see if any of those documents actually pan out.

324
00:29:59,594 --> 00:30:01,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, because it's all subject to change.

325
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:05,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very curious about, and I have a hard time grasping what this is.

326
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:17,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is some game, a new game in there that leaked that is, some are saying it's a Pokemon MMO, and some are saying it's like some interesting combo of the first four regions all together.

327
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:21,494
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that from what you know?

328
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:23,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what you just said.

329
00:30:23,662 --> 00:30:26,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anything more than that.

330
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:26,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's fine.

331
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,949
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably read these documents more than I did.

332
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:30,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't.

333
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of went, oh, interesting.

334
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I screenshot it and sent them to you, I remember.

335
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:37,197
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read them once.

336
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:38,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it.

337
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not gone back.

338
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was more.

339
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the Reddit or whatever you were looking at had way more info than just what you sent me.

340
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:45,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

341
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:46,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

342
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,069
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was really it.

343
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:50,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, kind of to be like,

344
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:56,251
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat respectful, if you can even call it that, to the developers.

345
00:30:56,271 --> 00:31:01,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to just read what they don't intend other people to read.

346
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:04,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm not going to make any... And I'm not going to get my hopes up.

347
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to make any decisions about these games based on this leak.

348
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:12,085
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just one of those like, oh, but we can't ignore that it happened either.

349
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just, it's out there now.

350
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:21,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something that's interesting about the leaks is that prior to this latest round of leaks...

351
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:47,533
[SPEAKER_01]: uh we were told via the leakers that um gen 10 would take place in Greece like a Greece uh region and not only because of the new leak did we find out that that was an option but we found out that's not even remotely true and it's a completely different like place so

352
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:53,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get I don't want to read this stuff and get my hopes up and then just be like crushed.

353
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:54,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

354
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:59,561
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll leave that to the three-hour rage bait YouTubers that are talking about how all these games are the worst thing ever.

355
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:01,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

356
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:02,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You know all the things.

357
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:05,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft needs to buy Pokemon or something like that, whatever they say.

358
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:07,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

359
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:09,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

360
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,119
[SPEAKER_05]: People are unhinged online.

361
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:18,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So another question in chat from Mr. 200 Matt who's asking, so you've beaten ZA now.

362
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just Shining Hunting now?

363
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:32,324
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because the shiny charm is not even locked behind dex completion, but is locked behind a lot of other stuff I still have to do.

364
00:32:33,345 --> 00:32:42,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I don't know if I'm at the point with this game where I feel like I want to just go out and shiny hunt.

365
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:46,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go and make more teams.

366
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep fighting in the ZA battles.

367
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:51,792
[SPEAKER_01]: at night.

368
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:56,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do the online more.

369
00:32:56,237 --> 00:33:07,891
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually fun and I have to do it on all my accounts I play on because of the stupid Mega Greninja stone being locked behind it and then the other starters each season.

370
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:10,374
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do PvP to do that?

371
00:33:10,394 --> 00:33:14,539
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to but you don't have to win your fights.

372
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:18,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a point-based system to rank up.

373
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:19,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that sounds bad.

374
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:30,237
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you look at a guide it will tell you like what you can do to earn points because it is very important to know you can go into a fight and lose points overall.

375
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:47,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that one fight so that sucked but if you do specific actions or play specific ways and don't get first place you can still earn quite a few points and you can probably get your rank K is where you get the Greninja Stone

376
00:33:48,068 --> 00:34:01,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably within an hour, hour and a half at most And that's with bad Pokemon, that's not being like max level or anything Alright, good to know Let's see, what else do I ask you about at this point?

377
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still playing Pokemon Go?

378
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:13,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I just did the Rayquaza, or the Mega Rayquaza weekend

379
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,648
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple days ago because I didn't have a shiny yet.

380
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:19,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got three.

381
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:20,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I was happy with that.

382
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:21,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

383
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:33,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And being in locations outside of the US, it is far more fun to play Pokemon Go because you can actually just kind of walk everywhere and have a good time.

384
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:34,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are playing.

385
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,807
[SPEAKER_01]: God, here in New Zealand,

386
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:42,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's mostly spoofers, but as soon as a raid hour starts, everything is full.

387
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:46,102
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not matter because this is the first time zone.

388
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:49,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's all the people trying to see the early time zone.

389
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:51,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:58,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is great for me because I can go outside and walk and there's nobody there, but I'm still at a 20 person fight and it's great.

391
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:04,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in Japan, there's all the events constantly over there and

392
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:07,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just far more fun.

393
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:13,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for coming on and sharing about Legends EA and that you're enjoying it.

394
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:19,664
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about the DLC that they're already announced for that?

395
00:35:19,864 --> 00:35:29,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's just another rage bait topic because tons of games announced DLCs before their primary game come out.

396
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm happy there's DLC.

397
00:35:33,908 --> 00:35:38,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's wrong to announce DLC before your game actually comes out.

398
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,565
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't understand how game development works.

399
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:45,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw people say, that just means they took out stuff from the main game.

400
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:47,698
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not.

401
00:35:47,999 --> 00:36:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if they were like...

402
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:16,576
[SPEAKER_01]: The story stops halfway through the game.

403
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:20,980
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only get to rank C and you need DLC to get the rest.

404
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be shitty.

405
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,103
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

406
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's totally understandable at that point.

407
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:34,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you give me a game that has a start and then a finish, and that's a complete story, give me DLC.

408
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:37,037
[SPEAKER_01]: If I like the game, I'll pick it up.

409
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:40,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And you better believe I already pre-ordered it for...

410
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:45,967
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my copies I have of this game so far.

411
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:52,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, sadly those new megas and that have already leaked too, which is such a bummer.

412
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:55,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least it's something to look forward to.

413
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,784
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, before we let you go tonight, you know, OLR is going to end next month.

414
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only 3pm almost, it's not tonight.

415
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:06,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's Monday.

416
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:07,958
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing it on the wrong day.

417
00:37:08,078 --> 00:37:08,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

418
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:18,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, the fact that this show is going to end next month and you've been around since like the double digits, you know, early, early on in this.

419
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,992
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, thank you for being a part of the show for so long.

420
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:30,062
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when you did have your ins in the game development industry, I remember you brought us like a brand new DDR song that people hadn't heard before.

421
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:52,860
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were able to play that for people and that was a big way for us to kind of like catch traction on DDR Freak and all that so I really appreciate that but like you know kind of this is probably the last time you're going to be on the show since it's ending next month anything like that you look back on and go that was that was a lot of fun at OLR anything that you kind of like good memories of the show that you remember?

422
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll do two.

423
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I will piggyback off what you just said for the first one.

424
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:05,610
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I brought Echo Image.

425
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the big get.

426
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:08,092
[SPEAKER_01]: You did.

427
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:13,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fine for me to say this now.

428
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:13,917
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

429
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:14,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

430
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:23,826
[SPEAKER_01]: But piggybacking off that, I wouldn't have been able to

431
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:35,620
[SPEAKER_01]: get that experience in the game industry probably without OLR because knowing you guys got me the connections I needed to get to Konami.

432
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I will always be thankful for.

433
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:39,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Never thought of that.

434
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

435
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:50,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing I will say is I don't really have a specific memory of like

436
00:38:50,975 --> 00:38:51,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was awesome.

437
00:38:52,077 --> 00:39:03,714
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember back in the early, early days when doing the show felt kind of like just a random get together slash house party.

438
00:39:04,335 --> 00:39:10,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And those episodes were always fun because it was just like hanging out with friends, talking about stuff you liked.

439
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:15,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't so rigid in what we had to talk about.

440
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,994
[SPEAKER_01]: If something came up, it came up.

441
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:17,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.

442
00:39:19,628 --> 00:39:48,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well have fun with Pokemon Legends and I don't know you don't really create content anymore so I'd ask where people could find you Japan, hopefully I'll be there in 8 days You don't want to be found No, no, you want to go to the Taito Arcade and we'll go play some what is the newest 2DX it just came out as I left we'll just go play Pinky Crush or something

443
00:39:49,463 --> 00:39:51,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

444
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:55,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for taking time out of your day to join us, Shane.

[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again for all the support over the years.

[SPEAKER_05]: sure thing goodbye bye talk to you later well he just like hung right up all right uh thank you Shane for uh participating on the show and YYR in chat says Sparkle Shower was the name of that 2DX game the new one all right it could literally been anything especially I don't think there's any conventions anymore with that stuff uh let's get into our gaming weeks Loki how was your gaming week

449
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:42,572
[SPEAKER_03]: um it was mainly just Minecraft stuff I edited together one of my videos put that out and then um I was watching like some of the MCC Twitch Rivals stuff uh today just catching up on that because I'm out there oh that's fun that's good that's good you can watch that yeah

450
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:43,754
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

451
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:48,098
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, mostly Pokemon Legends ZA, since we were already talking about that.

452
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:52,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But also a little bit of Diablo 4 still on this season.

453
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:56,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And boy, oh boy, I'm having a really good time with the Hydra Mage because she's really overpowered.

454
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,269
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm loving it.

455
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot of fun.

456
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Very satisfying on that front.

457
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:04,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's really the bulk of what I've been playing this week.

458
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:07,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I talk about Luminous Arise last week?

459
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if that demo... I don't think you did.

460
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:09,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

461
00:41:10,282 --> 00:41:10,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

462
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:30,058
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

463
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:34,047
[SPEAKER_05]: They took everything from like Tetris Effect and just made it Luminous.

464
00:41:34,068 --> 00:41:44,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously like, you know, the songs are different and the themes are different, but it's very, very much like, like literally like instead of doing a sequel to Tetris Effect, we just decided to kind of do the same thing with Luminous.

465
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, why...

466
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:50,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Fix a formula that doesn't need fixing, like, honestly.

467
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:51,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so I'm not complaining.

468
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:52,743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a complaint.

469
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually, I think, a very smart thing for them to do.

470
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:57,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited to try it in VR.

471
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the demo actually isn't available in VR.

472
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:04,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping I could go over to a friend's house and check it out on his headset, but I wasn't able to do that.

473
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:07,730
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did enjoy the – it's only like a three-stage.

474
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's the first little section.

475
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:11,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I still enjoyed it.

476
00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:17,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe my one complaint, it's almost a little bit too visually stimulating.

477
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:22,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost overwhelming visually, and I do hope there's a way to turn that down.

478
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:23,721
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be my thing.

479
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:49,708
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

480
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:50,689
[SPEAKER_05]: However, that's it.

481
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:51,891
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the last show we're going to miss.

482
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:57,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we come back the week after in early November, and there will be four shows.

483
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:59,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last show will be November 23rd.

484
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So episode 1070 is the last show.

485
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:10,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I'm tempted to call the last show OLR the final, so that way our last episode number is 1069.

486
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the way we ought to do it.

487
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:12,962
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

488
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

489
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

490
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:17,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

491
00:43:17,913 --> 00:43:18,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done then.

492
00:43:18,654 --> 00:43:18,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

493
00:43:20,377 --> 00:43:21,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some gaming news.

494
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:22,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

495
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to run downstairs.

496
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:26,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to leave you by yourself, but I have to run downstairs real quick.

497
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:27,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no problem.

498
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:41,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, I think we've heard about this lawsuit with Tencent and Sony over Tencent's game, Light of Motiram, I guess.

499
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:42,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

500
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:52,970
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very clearly inspired, maybe not legally distinct enough, according to Sony, version of Horizon Zero Dawn, at least aesthetically.

501
00:43:53,452 --> 00:43:58,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it plays the same, obviously, but it has to do with this whole...

502
00:43:58,977 --> 00:44:07,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Techno Tribal, you know, robot dinosaurs type thing that is very iconic with the Horizon series.

503
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:13,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, now there's still this legal battle going on, and we have some more details regarding that.

504
00:44:14,895 --> 00:44:26,689
[SPEAKER_03]: One of which, of course, is that apparently Tencent was just using the possibility of this game to lure Sony into meetings so it could pitch...

505
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:43,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only Light of Motrium, it says aka Project Z, the Horizon Zero Dawn game, but also that it could possibly pitch a Last of Us type of game as well.

506
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.

507
00:44:45,758 --> 00:45:02,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that comes out of this, and one of the reasons why they're trying to seek a preliminary injunction on the game itself, is because it is not set to release until 2027, which is also about the same time the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is planned.

508
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

509
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:08,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was officially announced at one point, but we didn't know too much about it.

510
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:16,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is in development with Columbia Pictures, and apparently that they have a working script and they were searching for a director.

511
00:45:17,692 --> 00:45:23,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now I'm planning on releasing it in 2027, shooting it next year.

512
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course...

513
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:36,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with that, the worry, I guess, is that this comes out, the people are going to see this game by Tencent and go, hey, that's a Horizon game.

514
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:36,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play that.

515
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:37,900
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not.

516
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:39,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a Horizon game.

517
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:42,446
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't we have games that kind of look like other games all the time?

518
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:43,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

519
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:52,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, me saying that Lego game that you were showing at the top of the show live on Twitch was Minecraft something at first.

520
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:54,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, games kind of look like other games sometimes.

521
00:45:54,402 --> 00:45:58,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I think in this case, you know, Lego has its own look.

522
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:59,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I get it.

523
00:45:59,232 --> 00:46:00,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's blocky and stuff.

524
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:07,990
[SPEAKER_03]: You could say, oh, well, this is ripping off Mario Party, but Mario Party doesn't or at least

525
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:13,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Nintendo would think that it owns the copyright to that, to the party game genre.

526
00:46:14,664 --> 00:46:15,825
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not own that.

527
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:22,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember like, hey, back in the day, back in the 90s and stuff, like every fighting game, oh, that's just a Street Fighter clone.

528
00:46:22,974 --> 00:46:24,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a ripoff of Street Fighter.

529
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:26,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a ripoff of Mortal Kombat.

530
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, it's hard to say.

531
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:35,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when Beatmania came out in the US and G4 said it was a ripoff of Guitar Hero?

532
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,850
Yeah.

533
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're stupid, but that's ridiculous.

534
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:48,928
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just ill-informed people that, yes, they look similar, but... Ill-informed people on my internet?

535
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're acting as, like, news broadcasters, and you don't research your stories?

536
00:46:57,767 --> 00:46:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

537
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:03,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess you could say they're entertainers, and they were just mainly hosting.

538
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:06,317
[SPEAKER_03]: They have people behind the scenes that are... Doesn't matter.

539
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Something happened, it, you know, they look silly about it, and hey, you know what?

540
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:18,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad to, you know, admit, but that mistake cost them G4, so you gotta be careful on those facts.

541
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I don't know.

542
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:23,899
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see where this goes.

543
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,283
[SPEAKER_03]: This is legal stuff.

544
00:47:25,423 --> 00:47:26,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They worry about that stuff.

545
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:28,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Horizon is its own thing.

546
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:29,873
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tencent game I don't want to play.

547
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:32,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh.

548
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that gamers can also...

549
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:42,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The gaming community has this certain sense of being able to smell out quality a lot of the times, right?

550
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, exactly.

551
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:50,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, like, it's different when you have a game like Power World where you're like, oh, that looks like Pokemon.

552
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:54,247
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you're like, wait, the gameplay is completely different.

553
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:58,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it does look a little close to Pokemon.

554
00:47:58,413 --> 00:48:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, except it has, like, guns and stuff in it.

555
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:02,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a bit close.

556
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is also kind of riding that line of, like,

557
00:48:06,365 --> 00:48:14,556
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks pretty close, but at the same time, does Sony own the patent on that type of environment?

558
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but are the designs of the creatures very similar to the Horizon game?

559
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:25,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little too much, but that's for a judge to figure out.

560
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:27,604
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

561
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:30,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And a judge will figure it out, I'm sure, in the coming seven years.

562
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:31,831
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

563
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on and talk about an Intellivision console that's actually going to be coming out.

564
00:48:40,324 --> 00:48:42,047
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty exciting.

565
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:46,774
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be getting the Intellivision Spirit, and it's coming to us from Atari.

566
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:50,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, folks, Atari bought Intellivision.

567
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they're making things sort of happen.

568
00:48:53,024 --> 00:49:15,454
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:49:15,434 --> 00:49:35,485
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

570
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:39,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it smells like an Intellivision and it has an HDMI port.

571
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:47,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very similar to what this is, except instead of there is no cartridge port, it's going to have 45 built-in games.

572
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:53,226
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's maybe a little bit more like a flashback console, which by the way, I bought one of those like Intellivision.

573
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:54,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Intellivision flashback?

574
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was.

575
00:49:55,168 --> 00:49:59,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually came with a little plastic overlay cards like this one does.

576
00:49:59,854 --> 00:50:02,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought one in like 2018 or 2019.

577
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:10,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So like for me, this isn't exactly new, but maybe it's a little bit like you're kind of getting it more from the source, I guess.

578
00:50:10,431 --> 00:50:17,203
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not, I don't, I really feel like what's this got that the last one I bought didn't have besides maybe some different games.

579
00:50:18,004 --> 00:50:23,754
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, maybe it's sturdier because the last one was pretty cheaply made, but it was, it ran fine.

580
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:25,317
Yeah.

581
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Intellivision Spirit is going to cost $150.

582
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other difference is the price.

583
00:50:33,254 --> 00:50:34,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one I bought was $80.

584
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:38,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that's tariffs or what, but that's wild.

585
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: $150.

586
00:50:39,545 --> 00:50:39,886
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

587
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:40,747
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

588
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:46,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-orders are available now and you can check that out on December 5th.

589
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:48,302
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so interesting.

590
00:50:48,322 --> 00:51:02,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this article I'm looking at right now ends with saying, it's a good thing it's not going to be vaporware like Intellivision's Amico, completely failing to point out Intellivision and Amico no longer have anything to do with each other.

591
00:51:06,978 --> 00:51:12,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I have to say at that price, I'm not interested in this console.

592
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:15,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bringing anything new to the table that I didn't already buy a few years ago.

593
00:51:17,129 --> 00:51:21,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby says a wireless controller is the big thing that's different.

594
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:23,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's, yeah.

595
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,779
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR says that's more than I would have expected.

596
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:34,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Same, but I have a feeling that our, you know, idiot in chief and the plans to, you know,

597
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:40,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Tax the American People with Tariffs, which are just taxes, plays into that a little bit.

598
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:47,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Travis C78 in chat says, I still have the Intellivision and all the games my dad came home with when I was seven.

599
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:48,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Nostalgia hit.

600
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:51,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, like the Intellivision was a fine console.

601
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, it was that competitor, the Atari 2600.

602
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,066
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some pretty good bangers on it for the time.

603
00:51:57,046 --> 00:52:19,257
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

604
00:52:19,338 --> 00:52:43,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be curious to see how this sells when we've kind of seen a very similar thing so many times But it didn't seem to stop the Atari, like Atari's been tapping that nostalgic keg for a very long time and it's worked So why shouldn't it work for Intellivision I guess?

605
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:46,406
[SPEAKER_05]: 2018 was seven years ago at this point.

606
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:50,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's almost, you know, a lot of changes since then.

607
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:52,576
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

608
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:52,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

609
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:54,519
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

610
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:59,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo has suffered a leak.

611
00:52:59,387 --> 00:53:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, well, they claim that nothing was leaked following a recent hack attempt by the hacker group Crimson Collective.

612
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:10,405
[SPEAKER_03]: However...

613
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:38,687
[SPEAKER_03]: there's been like they said that no personal data or personal or dev related info was leaked but I don't know so we will not be getting information about the next five years of releases out of Nintendo from this is what you're saying I guess not from Nintendo it's kind of weird because I equate the Pokemon company as Nintendo so it's like oh but that leaked but I guess it's not so but hey at least nothing leaked there

614
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:41,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say the same for other... Yeah.

615
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, your names, passwords, and credit cards didn't leak, so that's good.

616
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I don't have to get my ID to Nintendo.

617
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's good.

618
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:49,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that's a whole... Oh my god.

619
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:52,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Whole other... Whole other thing.

620
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:53,769
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

621
00:53:55,192 --> 00:54:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: With laws in the world, this is interesting because this is coming out of Mexico and it's the whole violent video game debate coming back all over again.

622
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was in a different way.

623
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:10,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that Mexico is looking to ban violent video games.

624
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

625
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:35,555
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to pass a law that GameStop wouldn't be able to sell violent video games.

626
00:54:35,615 --> 00:54:44,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ended up flopping in court because there was no... The line of what is a violent video game was too blurred.

627
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too open to interpretation.

628
00:54:46,613 --> 00:54:49,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It was too... You couldn't...

629
00:54:49,846 --> 00:55:14,723
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

630
00:55:14,703 --> 00:55:18,968
[SPEAKER_05]: and that would be extreme violence, bloodshed and moderate graphic sexual content.

631
00:55:19,008 --> 00:55:20,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's like a Mortal Kombat game.

632
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:30,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a C. A D rating is adults only and that's what they call prolonged scenes that include similar content.

633
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:35,607
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am taking that to mean a C is like an M rating and a D is like an AO rating.

634
00:55:36,147 --> 00:55:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's probably more nuance to it than that but that's enough to help you understand what's going on.

635
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:45,478
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually something that dates back to being first proposed back in September.

636
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:59,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're trying to use the old line about, oh, well, you know, there's a parallel with violent video games and making teenagers more... If you say so.

637
00:55:59,354 --> 00:55:59,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

638
00:56:01,196 --> 00:56:09,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be noted that this whole report that it is based in, this is a study from 2012.

639
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:11,141
[SPEAKER_05]: In a footnote.

640
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:18,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also has some positive associations with games like resilience, motor learning, things of that sort.

641
00:56:18,514 --> 00:56:21,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, this would apply.

642
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:28,652
[SPEAKER_05]: What is also interesting about this, this is going to be a tax applied to digital and physical copies of the affected games.

643
00:56:28,632 --> 00:56:37,205
[SPEAKER_05]: This still has to be cleared through the Senate in Mexico, and then it's going to be debated on November 15th before the budget proposal goes forward.

644
00:56:37,526 --> 00:56:41,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess maybe that's another interesting thing is that it ties into a budget proposal, right?

645
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:43,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like an independent law.

646
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:52,108
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basically saying in order to have the money into the economy, we're going to add a tax here to do that.

647
00:56:52,088 --> 00:57:06,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Deft Deft

648
00:57:06,787 --> 00:57:07,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fair enough.

649
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:09,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured that's how it was.

650
00:57:11,613 --> 00:57:15,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it makes me wonder if they could do something similar here.

651
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize we had the Supreme Court thing.

652
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:20,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

653
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:21,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you probably said, no, they can't.

654
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:22,367
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already been fought at the Supreme Court.

655
00:57:22,387 --> 00:57:24,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, number one, Supreme Court's different now.

656
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:31,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, the fact that it hinges on that ESRB board rating is interesting.

657
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And that it's a tax, not a ban.

658
00:57:33,922 --> 00:57:35,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also interesting.

659
00:57:35,924 --> 00:57:36,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

660
00:57:37,904 --> 00:57:41,215
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what, as if you're not paying enough for video games right now.

661
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we need to pay more for video games.

662
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:45,988
[SPEAKER_05]: They want $100 video games.

663
00:57:46,068 --> 00:57:56,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine if now you had to pay another 8% on top of... And to be fair, this is what they're looking at in Mexico, and I feel bad because... And Def shared with us this on the show before.

664
00:57:56,741 --> 00:58:02,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very hard to get consoles a lot of times in Mexico if the console hasn't officially been released in that region.

665
00:58:02,808 --> 00:58:05,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, and Def says video games are already expensive here.

666
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:06,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

667
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:08,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So like an 8% tax is like...

668
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:35,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do video games at all?

669
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:55,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you just go PC and then you have like, you know Stupid CEOs are like, my game's never going down in price soon So you just got to shell out that $80 if you're a true fan And then a month later it goes down 30% Is that what happened with Borderlands 4?

670
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:57,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know, did it?

671
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:02,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know, I picked it up for 30% off So

672
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:10,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just so weird how that game that never was going to dip in price just dipped in price like all games do.

673
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe Randy Pitchford doesn't know anything.

674
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've already covered that.

675
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:17,955
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

676
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:21,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, one more here before the classic game.

677
00:59:21,618 --> 00:59:23,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, this is pretty cool.

678
00:59:23,942 --> 00:59:25,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we could get those over here.

679
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is, in Japan, McDonald's Japan is doing a tie-in with Street Fighter.

680
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:40,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have specific street burgers with these really funny 16-bit commercials or videos that they're making for this stuff.

681
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:41,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

682
00:59:41,817 --> 01:00:03,876
[SPEAKER_03]: that are pretty awesome looking and they they've got one that's a it's a teriyaki burger with egg on it uh sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich it sounds good and a triple cheeseburger I like the videos I really wish they had a version of Street Fighter with the hamburger attacks in there so it'd be amazing

683
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

684
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a McDonald's version of Street Fighter 2.

685
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:10,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they've already got it in the trailer.

686
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:12,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me Capcom.

687
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:13,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

688
01:00:13,467 --> 01:00:15,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, this would be the perfect tie-in right here.

689
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Street Fighter 2, like, you've sold it so many times.

690
01:00:18,052 --> 01:00:19,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could practically give it away.

691
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do, like, a small, like, six-character demo that has three stages or something like that.

692
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just, like, let's play it.

693
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

694
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:33,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be so easy and such awesome publicity.

695
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:37,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Quest Buster in chat says, I want a McDonald's version of Street Fighter 2 also.

696
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck yeah.

697
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:38,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck yeah.

698
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:40,315
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

699
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:40,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's this?

700
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:47,122
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have something that says, in addition, they also have Overflowing Energy McFizz.

701
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:50,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sparkling apple juice and a McFloat.

702
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it adds sparkling apple juice.

703
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:53,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

704
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:58,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean if there's a float, does that mean the ice cream machines work in Japan?

705
01:00:58,818 --> 01:00:59,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

706
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:00,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.

707
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan is just so far ahead of us in technology.

708
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:03,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild.

709
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:03,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

710
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:05,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We're never going to catch up.

711
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange right in chat says, just imagine that Smash 64 commercial.

712
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,972
[SPEAKER_05]: There's trouble happening in the world of McDonaldland.

713
01:01:13,193 --> 01:01:15,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Grimace kicks the Hamburglar in the gut.

714
01:01:16,035 --> 01:01:18,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Slaggy McWaggy from Game Buoys in chat.

715
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:18,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Slaggy.

716
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Saying McDonald's land fighting game, Grimace versus Birdie.

717
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I would support that, but only if the hot Hamburglar is in it.

718
01:01:26,464 --> 01:01:31,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be the hot Hamburglar from like 15 years ago when they tried to reboot the Hamburglar and made them hot.

719
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,151
[SPEAKER_05]: If the hot Hamburglar is in the game, then I'm fine with it.

720
01:01:35,171 --> 01:01:36,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, keep it.

721
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:40,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into the classic game of the week.

722
01:01:51,329 --> 01:01:59,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

723
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:02,187
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

724
01:02:03,128 --> 01:02:04,029
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

725
01:02:04,069 --> 01:02:10,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game that I have picked for you this week, since, you know, DarkSakura is not here, so she can't pick the game.

726
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I am left to pick the game tonight.

727
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, this might actually be the last time I get to pick a game.

728
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:16,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

729
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But I went back through kind of like the NES archive of like, what are some Nintendo games maybe I haven't talked about yet?

730
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:30,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And I landed on this one, which I consider to be the sequel to one of the all-time great NES games.

731
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Fester's Quest.

732
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:38,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Fester's Quest is the game I've picked for the classic game of the week.

733
01:02:38,115 --> 01:02:42,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's starting, this video we're showing on Twitch lovingly starts on a game over screen.

734
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,261
[SPEAKER_05]: How appropriate.

735
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, here's the deal.

736
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:48,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So Fester's Quest, yes, it is a tie-in to The Addams Family, hence the name of the game.

737
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:53,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It was developed by Sunsoft, who also made Blaster Master.

738
01:02:53,874 --> 01:03:00,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The composer of the music in the game, Naoki Koroaka, also the composer of Blaster Master, is...

739
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: In this game, you play as Uncle Fester.

740
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:18,006
[SPEAKER_05]: The plot, the loose plot of the game is that a UFO beams up the residents of the city where the Addams family are, except for the members of the family, and Grandmama is still there, and...

741
01:03:17,986 --> 01:03:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess she put a protective bubble or something on the home, a protective spell.

742
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:30,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So Gomez is busy guarding the home from aliens, so Uncle Fester has to use his gun to save the town.

743
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:32,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is, okay?

744
01:03:32,928 --> 01:03:38,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is so funny to me because, you know, looking back, and I joke about how this game is just a sequel to Blaster Master.

745
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:45,546
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at it, it really is just the overhead components of Blaster Master, right down to...

746
01:03:45,526 --> 01:04:10,960
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

747
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: You go around to different houses and you actually find members of the Addams Family.

748
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get, you know, you see Thing, the Little Hand, Wednesday, Grandmama Pugsley, Morticia Gomez.

749
01:04:21,297 --> 01:04:28,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can actually summon Lurch to get all of the enemies off the screen by using a noose item.

750
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:33,676
[SPEAKER_05]: You go through the city with all the houses and you go down into sewers.

751
01:04:34,157 --> 01:04:37,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how you traverse to get around tree obstacles.

752
01:04:37,202 --> 01:04:40,226
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is just one big giant fucking maze.

753
01:04:40,246 --> 01:04:49,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you get into certain parts of the buildings, you get into certain buildings, you actually will fight alien bosses.

754
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:50,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

755
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:53,647
[SPEAKER_05]: What was another game on the NES where we fought alien bosses?

756
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:53,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

757
01:04:55,574 --> 01:05:02,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it gives Fester a puzzle piece and a picture of the UFO and then we'll refill the items.

758
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:06,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Fester leaves the building and you can't go back through it.

759
01:05:06,192 --> 01:05:14,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So once all five bosses are gone, you board the UFO and beat one more boss and the invasion has been prevented.

760
01:05:14,065 --> 01:05:18,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting sort of like bug between the US version and the European version is...

761
01:05:18,592 --> 01:05:47,333
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

762
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:53,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you go back and IGN ranked it 45th on its top 100 NES games list.

763
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:57,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Some sites like Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it a 5 out of 10.

764
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Life gave it 1 star out of 10.

765
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:04,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, Nintendo Power gave it 4.45 out of 5.

766
01:06:04,778 --> 01:06:07,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And Video Game gave it 5 stars out of 5.

767
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:14,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is just a game where it's going to depend a little bit on your taste in games.

768
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:18,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that's how it goes sometimes.

769
01:06:19,864 --> 01:06:22,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to some comments in chat.

770
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:25,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Slaggy McWaggy says, where did Uncle Fester get a gun?

771
01:06:25,835 --> 01:06:30,904
[SPEAKER_05]: He did – actually, I think that is canon in the comics and –

772
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the movie, but I want to say the TV show.

773
01:06:34,304 --> 01:06:36,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But the gun wasn't like literal bullets.

774
01:06:36,768 --> 01:06:39,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more like a zany thing.

775
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:43,618
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR in chat says, cheap asset, flip, unity, crap, one star.

776
01:06:43,718 --> 01:06:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

777
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:48,144
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of not off the mark with a comment like that.

778
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:52,090
[SPEAKER_05]: They very much used assets they already had to make a tie-in game.

779
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do I pick a game like this?

780
01:06:54,694 --> 01:06:57,718
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game wasn't remembered as being very good, why do I pick it?

781
01:06:57,766 --> 01:07:27,773
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's amazing is why yeah I actually don't think it's as bad as people say it is I think there's a lot of NES games yeah there's a lot of NES games people look back on like and I feel this way about like the Friday the 13th game as well but I understand why people hate that game this game I'm like it's not as bad as people say it is but it's just not for everybody right and I remember this game distinctly because I asked for this game one Christmas I wanted to get this game on Christmas and

782
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:38,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one day I looked in the shopping bags as a curious kid of what my mom got from the

783
01:07:38,975 --> 01:08:07,092
[SPEAKER_05]: but of course I had to pretend that I didn't see it or else Christmas was going to get cancelled knowing my mother so I had to just make believe but that didn't stop me from fucking with my mother and what I mean by that is when we went to the game rental place to rent games and it was like two days before Christmas I saw Fester's Quest on the shelf and I was like oh I should rent this one I've really been wanting to play this game I did

784
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Bros.

785
01:08:14,616 --> 01:08:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 and Doki Doki Panic set the buy half or asset flips.

786
01:08:32,288 --> 01:08:33,130
[SPEAKER_05]: That's...

787
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very funny point, but that was a very different situation as well.

788
01:08:36,614 --> 01:08:38,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get the joke you're making there.

789
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:38,537
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

790
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:49,831
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeRite in chat says, I love that the commercial uses, if you make one mistake, it's back to the beginning again as a selling point.

791
01:08:49,851 --> 01:08:51,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty accurate.

792
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:52,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

793
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:57,201
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster in chat says, the NES years were like the Wild West of licenses.

794
01:08:57,221 --> 01:09:02,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You never knew what was going to get resurrected next, like giving Uncle Fester his own game just because.

795
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:16,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about this part of the game I know, I forgot about those and you're talking about the mazes that look like the old old Phantasy Star 1 mazes or like PC RPG mazes yeah, the flicker is harsh, right, PopCulture?

796
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even realize this game had a strobing effect, sorry um

797
01:09:21,068 --> 01:09:24,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I do still kind of look back fondly on this.

798
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:26,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say also the early 90s.

799
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:32,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess it wasn't quite in 89 yet because this game came out 89, right?

800
01:09:32,393 --> 01:09:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it came out September of 89 and then in Europe in the 90s.

801
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,166
[SPEAKER_05]: When was that Addams Family movie released?

802
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:39,029
[SPEAKER_05]: That was around the time.

803
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:39,950
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was 91.

804
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say the first Addams Family movie was 91.

805
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe they knew they were going to do that.

806
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:48,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, because I always thought this tied into the movie, but I guess not.

807
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:51,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really more because of like probably the TV show.

808
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:54,483
[SPEAKER_05]: The TV shows were still in reruns when I was 10, though.

809
01:09:54,543 --> 01:09:57,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember they used to show old Addams Family on Channel 58.

810
01:09:57,386 --> 01:10:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I got into it.

811
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:01,910
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to show old Batman.

812
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,572
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to show old... Whoops, not that screen.

813
01:10:03,772 --> 01:10:04,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to show old Batman.

814
01:10:04,933 --> 01:10:06,735
[SPEAKER_05]: They used to show old...

815
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam's Family, and all the old shows.

816
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:12,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Dennis the Menace?

817
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:13,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

818
01:10:13,587 --> 01:10:14,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there it is.

819
01:10:14,588 --> 01:10:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Your Classic Game of the Week.

820
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis the Menace had a cartoon show at that time, too.

821
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:20,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

822
01:10:21,456 --> 01:10:24,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of your NES favorites, too, Loki.

823
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,382
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you remember about this game?

824
01:10:27,183 --> 01:10:32,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, I remember seeing this game in Nintendo Power is where I originally first saw it.

825
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

826
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:36,254
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to play because I like Blaster Master.

827
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:36,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

828
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: But totally not a sequel to Blaster Master, but it is.

829
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:45,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably a better sequel than the Genesis game.

830
01:10:47,188 --> 01:10:49,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it have the pause glitch thing with this one?

831
01:10:49,552 --> 01:10:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you had grenades in this game.

832
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:53,940
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they didn't do grenades.

833
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the whip instead.

834
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the gun and you had the whip.

835
01:10:57,547 --> 01:10:59,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, no grenades.

836
01:11:00,665 --> 01:11:05,115
[SPEAKER_05]: As Jonah and Matt says, now imagine a Wednesday spinoff with Fred Armisen with this.

837
01:11:05,216 --> 01:11:06,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha.

838
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, that Fester's getting his own show.

839
01:11:08,503 --> 01:11:12,452
[SPEAKER_05]: They confirmed that Netflix is going to do a Fred Armisen, Uncle Fester show.

840
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:14,256
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is Fred Armisen.

841
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:16,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, why would you give him another show?

842
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:20,827
[SPEAKER_05]: OrangeRite says, give Fester's Quest the Blaster Master zero treatment.

843
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:22,449
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a great idea.

844
01:11:23,089 --> 01:11:24,191
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a great idea.

845
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: They should do that as a tie-in to the upcoming series.

846
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of giving a game that really shouldn't have a sequel just a really awesome remaster.

847
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:38,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a second chance.

848
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

849
01:11:39,188 --> 01:11:41,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Bubsy 4D.

850
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:44,914
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't need a fourth game, but they...

851
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:47,921
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're like, we're going to give it 100%, man.

852
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:52,007
[SPEAKER_05]: They've, for God's sakes, they've re-released Night Trap how many times?

853
01:11:52,027 --> 01:11:53,810
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is not good.

854
01:11:53,830 --> 01:11:55,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is not good.

855
01:11:55,672 --> 01:12:12,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It is only remembered for being a FMV, full motion video game that had Dana Plato, who unfortunately lost, you know, well before her time and that it was girls running around scantily clad in a, you know, crossing the line of what might be an adults only type of game at that time.

856
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:12,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm.

857
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:14,539
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only reason that game is popular.

858
01:12:14,559 --> 01:12:15,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a good game.

859
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be very clear.

860
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:33,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, just along those lines too, and I don't think it made our show roll, but it was the 1995 Cyber Dreams game, I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream, or And I Must Scream, got an update recently that they were patching that game even.

861
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:40,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of funny that people are going back and still working on some of these games.

862
01:12:40,224 --> 01:12:40,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That is wild.

863
01:12:41,145 --> 01:12:42,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

864
01:12:42,286 --> 01:12:46,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, SlaggyMcWaggy in chat says, Rob is going to star in Night Trap 2026.

865
01:12:46,451 --> 01:12:49,874
[SPEAKER_05]: That is his first post-OLR project.

866
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:51,196
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, I don't know.

867
01:12:51,216 --> 01:12:54,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if I was approached to be in a Night Trap sequel, I guess I'd have to do it.

868
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:56,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, nobody's asked me to be in a video game before.

869
01:12:56,782 --> 01:12:58,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of have to do it, right?

870
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Alright, let's move on.

871
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:07,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do a couple other headlines real fast in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

872
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki...

873
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:12,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Red Dead Redemption 2 is getting some pretty funny mods.

874
01:13:12,812 --> 01:13:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one that a YouTuber, streamer Blurbs, created a moral combat mode in Red Dead Redemption 2.

875
01:13:24,729 --> 01:13:35,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So any encounter that you get with, you know, be it people, be it a bear, it actually goes into like a fighting game thing with health bars and stuff like that.

876
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:38,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's even fatalities in it.

877
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:39,613
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

878
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:43,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I've watched clips of it, and it looks really funny.

879
01:13:45,058 --> 01:13:47,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2 on my PC, though.

880
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:48,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I should check it out.

881
01:13:48,762 --> 01:13:49,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks awesome.

882
01:13:50,704 --> 01:13:52,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what else?

883
01:13:53,507 --> 01:14:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We got Psycho Shmups are going to be delisted from Steam on October 31st.

884
01:14:02,956 --> 01:14:08,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes Gunbird, Gunbird 2, Gunbarch,

885
01:14:08,602 --> 01:14:10,124
[SPEAKER_03]: or Gumbarich, I guess.

886
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:30,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dragon Blaze, Samurai Aces, Samurai Aces, Episode 2, Tengai, Samurai Aces, Episode 3, Sengoku Kanon, Soul Divide, Strikers 1945, 1945 2, and 1945 3, and Zero Gunner 2 are all going to be delisted and no longer available to purchase on there.

887
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:33,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I have quite a few of these.

888
01:14:33,578 --> 01:14:36,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I might be thinking of my handheld...

889
01:14:36,462 --> 01:14:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the reason is behind that.

890
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:42,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a license agreement.

891
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:43,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, of course.

892
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:43,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

893
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:45,553
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

894
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:47,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to music games.

895
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:50,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some of you out there are fans of Spin Rhythm XD.

896
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:53,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when Alan was streaming and he used to stream this.

897
01:14:53,662 --> 01:14:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Spin Rhythm is still going strong.

898
01:14:56,386 --> 01:14:59,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sold more than 100,000 units, FYI.

899
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:05,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are seven new tracks coming to the Indie Pack DLC coming out on November 11th.

900
01:15:05,116 --> 01:15:11,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this, uh, Sai and the Switch, but I'm assuming that's all platforms just because I'm looking at a Nintendo-based news website.

901
01:15:11,684 --> 01:15:16,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the artists that are going to be in this track, uh, this pack, I must admit, I do not know them.

902
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:26,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Blanco Tronco, Hai, Hachiku, Mai, Mei, Semanus, I don't know, sorry, if I'm, I'm probably horribly butchering these names, my apologies.

903
01:15:26,602 --> 01:15:29,385
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of sound like maybe...

904
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:29,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

905
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:32,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're Vocaloid type of bands, but I don't know.

906
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:33,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

907
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,972
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're indies, so of course I'm not going to know.

908
01:15:34,992 --> 01:15:35,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not shady.

909
01:15:35,713 --> 01:15:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't know them because they're indies, but maybe I should.

910
01:15:38,015 --> 01:15:39,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why this pack is coming out.

911
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, four-player local support in this game.

912
01:15:43,642 --> 01:15:46,966
[SPEAKER_05]: 70 songs now that this is up to.

913
01:15:47,026 --> 01:15:53,694
[SPEAKER_05]: The new indie pack will cost $7.99 or $6.99 in euros on November 11th.

914
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:55,937
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to get the base game, it is out for $20.

915
01:15:55,977 --> 01:15:58,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.

916
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:03,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can buy this coming week.

917
01:16:04,988 --> 01:16:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we've got quite a few things.

921
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:22,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And they got bullied out of the AI in that game, right?

922
01:16:22,731 --> 01:16:23,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that a thing?

923
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when they showed up the game and it was using AI?

924
01:16:26,756 --> 01:16:27,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that they did that.

925
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they got bullied out of it.

926
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,502

[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's a NES game.

930
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mega Cat Studios, definitely a NES game.

931

938
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to try.

939
01:18:20,248 --> 01:18:21,409

[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the arcade games are alright.

945
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:49,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel like it's a little bit reductive of other racing games in the arcade that are probably better, but it's cute.

946
01:18:50,684 --> 01:19:05,547
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 although that game is just Cruisin' I think which is on the Switch so Fast and Furious is just Cruisin' with the Fast and Furious branding?

947
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:11,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so because I remember Cruisin' because we had that

01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:28,234
[SPEAKER_03]: House of the Dead 2 remake on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Once Upon a Jester on PS5 and Xbox Series

[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:44,153
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

954
01:19:44,553 --> 01:19:52,082
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR, by the way, in chat says the new remaster of Plants vs. Zombies is based on the Windows Phone version and is full of bugs and glitches.

955
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:54,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew, why would you pick the Windows Phone for anything?

956
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ever pick the Windows Phone.

957
01:19:57,408 --> 01:20:01,294
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go to Japan and check out the releases there on the Switch 2 this week.

[SPEAKER_05]: Some Kirby themed things, some Mario Kart World themed things.

962
01:20:12,872 --> 01:20:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it in Japan for the Switch 2.

963
01:20:14,695 --> 01:20:18,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week is the Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD 2D though.

964
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,062

1017
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to end on a downer, but I didn't know where else to talk about this.

1018
01:25:07,374 --> 01:25:09,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This is very surprising, actually, Loki.

1019
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The longtime director of the Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series, Tomonobu Itagaki, has passed away at age 58.

1020
01:25:21,134 --> 01:25:23,097

1021
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:23,217
Yeah.

1022
01:25:23,855 --> 01:25:31,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically, you know, said that he had, you know, no regrets.

1023
01:25:31,764 --> 01:25:38,711
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, of course, Team Ninja put out, you know, statements saying, you know, we're deeply saddened by the passing of Team Ninja's first leader.

1024
01:25:38,731 --> 01:25:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy.

1025
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:49,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Our deepest condolences for his loss.

1026
01:25:49,775 --> 01:26:19,782
[SPEAKER_05]: and we have no idea as to the cause because there was a he had posted like a message on Facebook like through a friend or something that made the post it was a very itagaki statement because at the end it just kind of went so it goes you know type of thing it was very very sad um so yeah but obviously young so yeah I'm kind of left to think it might have been dizzy I don't I know speculating is very bad but you kind of want to know like why so early so um but what a huge loss to the industry and especially on the eve of

1027
01:26:19,762 --> 01:26:42,816
[SPEAKER_05]: that next yeah that's really unfortunate so um what a loss for the industry and uh very very sad to hear it so Dead or Alive huge contributions of that franchise as well it's it's he's really was a staple of like especially some of those E3s the years that we went like I remember what a legend that guy was so very sad to hear that

1028
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:43,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1029
01:26:44,378 --> 01:26:48,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on to the listener roundtable where you can get your thoughts and opinions in.

[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to send us an email, participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place where you can send us an email.

1031
01:26:54,795 --> 01:27:00,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check in there before the show tonight and I did not see any emails, but I do want to let you know the show ends next month.

1032
01:27:00,824 --> 01:27:05,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've ever been wanting to send us an email, now would be a great time to do it.

1033
01:27:05,071 --> 01:27:07,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so, uh, just a heads up on that.

1034
01:27:07,654 --> 01:27:09,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I did check social media as well.

1035
01:27:09,136 --> 01:27:15,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go, um, and you can always send us a post, uh, at our blue sky account, which is at orange launch radio.com.

1036
01:27:15,665 --> 01:27:18,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We are verified by domain on blue sky.

1037
01:27:18,468 --> 01:27:20,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think I saw much.

1038
01:27:21,112 --> 01:27:26,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I did notice we got a little tag from our buddies at game buoy who are always so kind to shout us out at the end of the show.

1039
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:35,010
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out right back to our friends at game buoy, uh, for, um, for all that they do over there.

1040
01:27:35,176 --> 01:27:37,499
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, everything else is from last week.

1041
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:47,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a slow week on social media, but I will say I did catch before the show, I did catch a post that Dark Tetsuya, and since it's on social media, I guess I can say it.

1042
01:27:48,455 --> 01:27:55,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya's in the ER right now and it sounds manageable because I see he's still putting replies, but still just sending our thoughts.

1043
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:58,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya has been here since episode one.

1044
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:13,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Any last minute stories you want to bring up here, Loki?

1045
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:37,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, it's YYR Hi, YYR, how are you?

1046
01:28:38,744 --> 01:28:40,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay.

1047
01:28:40,247 --> 01:28:44,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little surprised.

1048
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:55,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I will admit, I had not kept up with OLR in a hot minute.

1049
01:28:56,676 --> 01:29:00,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And I then, you know...

1050
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:18,859
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1051
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1052
01:29:21,482 --> 01:29:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not expect that.

1053
01:29:22,923 --> 01:29:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, surprise.

1054
01:29:28,809 --> 01:29:29,350
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

1055
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:38,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I listened to what you were saying about how all the news has been lately and what's going on in the industry.

1056
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, I get it.

1057
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's day after day after day.

1058
01:29:44,205 --> 01:29:48,610
[SPEAKER_04]: It really seems like we're headed towards...

1059
01:29:48,826 --> 01:29:49,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Something.

1060
01:29:50,188 --> 01:30:02,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't tell you what, but clearly we're out of the days of what was, and we're heading towards something different.

1061
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:08,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's weird feeling this lack of joy with a lot of things gaming.

1062
01:30:08,294 --> 01:30:11,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, at least Pokemon Legends is somewhat of a bright spot.

1063
01:30:11,499 --> 01:30:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I have my reservations of that game, I'm enjoying it.

1064
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having a good time.

1065
01:30:15,705 --> 01:30:17,888
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just does seem like there's so much...

1066
01:30:17,868 --> 01:30:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like all these things were just sort of converging where the universe is saying, girl, it's time.

1067
01:30:38,303 --> 01:30:40,286
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that.

1068
01:30:40,306 --> 01:30:40,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that.

1069
01:30:40,887 --> 01:30:41,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's as simple as that.

1070
01:30:43,431 --> 01:30:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so good to hear from you.

1071
01:30:45,655 --> 01:30:48,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, though, the good games are always going to be there.

1072
01:30:48,139 --> 01:30:48,941
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1073
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:51,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just at the top.

1074
01:30:53,728 --> 01:31:02,623
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I very much enjoy doing and totally didn't have the time to do but did it anyway...

1075
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:25,152
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1076
01:31:25,705 --> 01:31:40,795
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1077
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:57,518
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have to say the future of gaming is gonna be bright I played a lot of really good stuff I had a lot of fun and I can guarantee you that if you you know I'm pretty sure you're not going this year but I

1078
01:31:57,498 --> 01:32:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: whoever is out there if you go to magfest you're gonna get an indie showcase that is full of really great stuff and thank god for indies thank god for indies that do feel like a bright spot amongst so much like negative news we see sometimes so i do i do i would love to do like one more magfest at some point but um it's it's rough now that we're doing that cruise it's really hard to do those things back to back that's the only thing it's kind of a bummer yeah

1079
01:32:23,806 --> 01:32:25,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally get that.

1080
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:31,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get the work thing too, because we did a phone system transition recently.

1081
01:32:31,162 --> 01:32:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the last three weeks I've worked between six and seven days worth of hours.

1082
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,583
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exhausting.

1083
01:32:40,563 --> 01:32:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.

1084
01:32:41,364 --> 01:32:52,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to point out, by the way, I know our podcasties can't see this, but on Discord, where you're calling us in from tonight, you have all these artwork behind you, and it looks like it's things that your daughter made, I'm going to assume.

1085
01:32:52,941 --> 01:32:55,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much all that, yes.

1086
01:32:55,024 --> 01:32:55,485
[SPEAKER_05]: That's incredible.

1087
01:32:55,505 --> 01:32:56,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

1088
01:32:56,186 --> 01:32:56,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.

1089
01:32:56,987 --> 01:32:57,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

1090
01:32:57,648 --> 01:33:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great use of the wall real estate.

1091
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:06,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she's always creating something, which is really cool.

1092
01:33:06,421 --> 01:33:07,322
[SPEAKER_04]: How old is she now?

1093
01:33:08,063 --> 01:33:08,123
Oh.

1094
01:33:08,103 --> 01:33:10,267
[SPEAKER_04]: She is now 7.

1095
01:33:10,548 --> 01:33:11,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, we're old.

1096
01:33:12,231 --> 01:33:13,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1097
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I was expecting you to say like 4.

1098
01:33:18,584 --> 01:33:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally thought it was like recently.

1099
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:22,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I'm like, no, it was before COVID.

1100
01:33:22,652 --> 01:33:23,153
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

1101
01:33:23,173 --> 01:33:25,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

1102
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty nuts.

1103
01:33:29,973 --> 01:33:33,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again for always shouting out to me on the show.

1104
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in that episode, I just listened to like, oh, that Unity thing.

1105
01:33:40,554 --> 01:33:44,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wonder if YYR has to update all this stuff.

1106
01:33:45,768 --> 01:33:50,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for thinking of me, although none of my games actually run on Unity, so I didn't have to do anything.

1107
01:33:50,922 --> 01:33:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

1108
01:33:51,263 --> 01:33:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good.

1109
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, that's a good fun note.

1110
01:33:52,507 --> 01:33:53,048
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good fun note.

1111
01:33:53,389 --> 01:34:00,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, you know, just in case we don't get to talk to you again before this is all over, I just want to say you have been such fun.

1112
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:25,950
[SPEAKER_05]: to have around in this community and obviously one of the big things you did for us was you made wishes come true we had our list of you know games that we thought would be silly and you know you started you started granting wishes right you made bungee ferret tossing a reality and um you know obviously the and the games that you're making on your own without without all our influence you know again i i don't understand why super multitasking is not the indie darling

1113
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:41,188
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1114
01:34:41,590 --> 01:35:00,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I think really what it is is there's just so much good stuff on Steam.

1115
01:35:00,203 --> 01:35:05,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, releasing a game is kind of like buying a lotto ticket.

1116
01:35:06,316 --> 01:35:12,067
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a very, very small chance that you hit the jackpot.

1117
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:18,280
[SPEAKER_04]: There's somewhat of a chance that you get something small.

1118
01:35:19,205 --> 01:35:21,869
[SPEAKER_04]: and everybody else gets nothing.

1119
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:23,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like that.

1120
01:35:24,272 --> 01:35:29,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if your game is good, just because there's so many choices.

1121
01:35:31,283 --> 01:35:33,907
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you just keep releasing, keep trying.

1122
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:37,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I, over the years...

1123
01:35:37,885 --> 01:35:44,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I haven't hit the jackpot, but I've built up something of a small following.

1124
01:35:44,702 --> 01:35:51,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've had this one dude emailing me like every few years.

1125
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:54,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, is Snake coming back yet?

1126
01:35:55,773 --> 01:35:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

1127
01:35:57,776 --> 01:36:13,984
[SPEAKER_04]: When I put on Steam that it's coming soon, and there is now a page listed for Snake Party Extreme, which is the name I'm going with for basically what is the culmination of all of Snake 360's features and updates.

1128
01:36:13,964 --> 01:36:22,634
[SPEAKER_04]: There was actually a little-known 2016 release, one of the last Xbox Live indie games, Snake Party.

1129
01:36:22,654 --> 01:36:31,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has basically Snake 360, Snake Party, and then a few things from the cutting room floor that I'm putting back in because why the hell not?

1130
01:36:31,544 --> 01:36:33,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I don't know when to stop.

1131
01:36:34,307 --> 01:36:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to be Snake Party Extreme.

1132
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:42,797
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've been managing these big projects at work, you ought to know about Scope Creep, Aaron.

1133
01:36:42,857 --> 01:36:43,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1134
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm not making anything else for this.

1135
01:36:46,012 --> 01:36:53,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on right now the keyboard support and the other things that people buying a PC game expect to be there.

1136
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:59,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, achievements and leaderboards and the features that are going to be unique to Steam.

1137
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:03,134
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, nothing else is going in there.

1138
01:37:03,815 --> 01:37:06,758
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very done project.

1139
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm probably pushing it back to February.

1140
01:37:10,002 --> 01:37:12,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, yeah, it's coming.

1141
01:37:12,318 --> 01:37:14,423
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you said something there like two or three minutes ago.

1142
01:37:14,464 --> 01:37:24,309
[SPEAKER_05]: I really just want to kind of revisit because it felt very like I felt that when you said that you don't always hit the jackpot and you didn't hit the jackpot, but you got a really small loyal following that cares.

1143
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, hashtag relatable content just in a different medium.

1144
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:56,803
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah yeah no maybe we didn't hit the jackpot of fame but we definitely hit the jackpot of like really just like a really like coolest like a chill as fuck crowd everybody be chill like that's that's what we lucked out with here at Sunday we don't have a lot of drama llamas we don't you know it's it's been very very nice so uh very very lucky in that regard so you know and it's been great it's it's been great to have to have your voices here for for all these years and

1145
01:37:56,783 --> 01:38:00,909
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, to just be able to check back in.

1146
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:04,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a reminder to everyone, we're not dying.

1147
01:38:04,594 --> 01:38:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not all going on a boat that's going out to sea and then somebody set the boat on fire.

1148
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what's happening to us.

1149
01:38:10,943 --> 01:38:13,026
[SPEAKER_05]: We will still be around to do our things.

1150
01:38:13,086 --> 01:38:16,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do hope we get to support future releases.

1151
01:38:16,992 --> 01:38:24,563
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to look a little different, you know, just in whatever maybe I'm doing in the future, whatever Loki decides to do, maybe beyond Minecraft even in the future.

1152
01:38:24,543 --> 01:38:31,996
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, Jamie's whatever her show looks like in the future that hopefully, you know, and some of you in chat have been talking about, I don't know what I'm going to do on Sunday night.

1153
01:38:32,096 --> 01:38:34,360
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, well, we hope you'll continue to support Bobby.

1154
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:35,342
[SPEAKER_05]: He's still going to be here.

1155
01:38:35,362 --> 01:38:42,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, Jamie is looking at potentially, she doesn't know what day yet, but maybe a Sunday thing as a successor.

1156
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:42,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not right away.

1157
01:38:42,895 --> 01:38:45,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be like maybe the week after, but maybe come 2026.

1158
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:47,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all the details yet.

1159
01:38:47,302 --> 01:38:48,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in Jamie's hands.

1160
01:38:49,144 --> 01:39:07,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know a big part of them being at TwitchCon this weekend is networking, chatting, talking, inspiration, figuring out what that looks like, which is why we wanted to tell you all before TwitchCon so that way Jamie had the freedom to just tell anybody there without like, oh, I got a secret, I got a, you know, type of thing.

1161
01:39:07,807 --> 01:39:09,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1162
01:39:09,008 --> 01:39:12,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, I've also been dabbling in streaming as well.

1163
01:39:13,723 --> 01:39:16,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your birthday marathons for Max 300.

1164
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:16,993
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a stream.

1165
01:39:17,564 --> 01:39:22,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a stream, but more regularly, I've been playing most frequently.

1166
01:39:22,511 --> 01:39:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron, you know what I could do on Sunday nights?

1167
01:39:24,153 --> 01:39:26,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go play DDR now on Sunday night.

1168
01:39:27,737 --> 01:39:29,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I could do in my free time.

1169
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:29,900
[SPEAKER_05]: You should!

1170
01:39:30,281 --> 01:39:31,522
[SPEAKER_05]: You should!

1171
01:39:31,723 --> 01:39:34,286
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest version has like a bajillion songs.

1172
01:39:34,366 --> 01:39:35,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know.

1173
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:42,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We live, round one in Roseville got one of the new MyMys, which is all the rage, yeah.

1174
01:39:42,657 --> 01:39:49,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I... There's one in the city, but like the last time I went, the line was forever long.

1175
01:39:49,205 --> 01:39:54,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, finally it took... I hope they freaking appear everywhere.

1176
01:39:54,392 --> 01:39:56,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, finally in Sacramento.

1177
01:39:56,815 --> 01:40:01,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It only took 23 and a half years of this program, but finally the good music games are here.

1178
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:03,023
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to fucking go to LA to play.

1179
01:40:03,383 --> 01:40:05,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It only took us quitting to make that happen.

1180
01:40:05,546 --> 01:40:09,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So congratulations to the people of Sacramento and Roseville.

1181
01:40:10,893 --> 01:40:10,993
Yeah.

1182
01:40:12,847 --> 01:40:18,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Legend of Zelda on Saturday nights.

1183
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:21,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been playing it for a couple of years now.

1184
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:29,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've, again, built up a small but devoted following watching me play ROM hacks that are increasingly difficult.

1185
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:30,872
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this one dude making them.

1186
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:32,695
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes by ZeldaMaker.

1187
01:40:32,675 --> 01:41:01,298
[SPEAKER_04]: and the one I'm playing now is just absolutely balls to the wall difficult not only in terms of the combat but also like what the heck do I do now so I'm like a few hours into it and I'm just like oh boy so and then I've been streaming just random stuff on Wednesdays but I was actually toying with the idea like

1188
01:41:02,341 --> 01:41:15,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if I could do some sort of hour-long show where I either discuss news or take calls while also trying to play a game.

1189
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And the idea is, you know, try to rile up the host so that he screws up his game kind of thing.

1190
01:41:22,872 --> 01:41:24,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can you do that?

1191
01:41:24,735 --> 01:41:28,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it all takes an idea and a commitment.

1192
01:41:28,462 --> 01:41:31,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So like physically, are you capable of doing that?

1193
01:41:31,347 --> 01:41:33,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And like smarts wise, are you capable of doing that?

1194
01:41:33,390 --> 01:41:33,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1195
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:34,692
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing stopping you.

1196
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:35,293
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do it.

1197
01:41:35,694 --> 01:41:38,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But now the question is, is it worth it?

1198
01:41:38,699 --> 01:41:40,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the commitment you want to make?

1199
01:41:40,462 --> 01:41:43,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of that second question to answer.

1200
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:51,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, if that's what you decide you want to do, which, you know, sounds like a kind of a fun concept, you know, I would ask, how is that going to vary week to week?

1201
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:53,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it would be the game that you're playing or whatever.

1202
01:41:53,234 --> 01:41:56,001
[SPEAKER_05]: But would the derailment concept get old week after week?

1203
01:41:56,302 --> 01:41:57,846
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that would be...

1204
01:41:57,826 --> 01:41:58,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I do hope you explore.

1205
01:41:59,028 --> 01:42:01,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I want to empower people to create content.

1206
01:42:01,593 --> 01:42:08,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks out there have been very kind, especially in these closing hours of saying that OLR inspired me to do my own podcast.

1207
01:42:09,006 --> 01:42:20,606
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very humbling and really the best possible compliment I think we can get is that like showing that, hey, if we can do it, you can do it and people do it is amazing.

1208
01:42:20,627 --> 01:42:21,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge compliment.

1209
01:42:23,476 --> 01:42:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's something to think about then.

1210
01:42:25,719 --> 01:42:34,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wish you the best in whatever's next for you, and if, you know, whatever it is, I look forward to supporting you from a different medium, from a different boat.

1211
01:42:35,373 --> 01:42:37,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I could say exactly the same thing right back to you.

1212
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:39,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

1213
01:42:39,619 --> 01:42:48,431
[SPEAKER_05]: All the best, and maybe we'll talk to you again before it's all over, but just in case, hey to the family, and I better not blink, and that kid is driving.

1214
01:42:48,592 --> 01:42:50,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I better not blink, and that kid is driving.

1215
01:42:51,455 --> 01:42:53,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on how much you blink.

1216
01:42:53,258 --> 01:42:54,700
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.

1217
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:56,082
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1218
01:42:56,162 --> 01:42:56,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Aaron.

1219
01:42:57,084 --> 01:42:57,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

1220
01:42:58,226 --> 01:42:58,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you too.

1221
01:42:58,867 --> 01:42:59,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week.

1222
01:42:59,688 --> 01:42:59,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1223
01:42:59,928 --> 01:43:00,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

1224
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:02,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

1225
01:43:02,412 --> 01:43:02,853
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1226
01:43:03,854 --> 01:43:06,819
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be fun and also difficult these last few weeks.

1227
01:43:06,839 --> 01:43:10,144
[SPEAKER_05]: All these voices from memory lane are going to be coming back, but it's a good thing.

1228
01:43:10,345 --> 01:43:11,286
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good thing.

1229
01:43:11,772 --> 01:43:13,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Last Minute Stories.

1230
01:43:13,355 --> 01:43:14,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I already check in on that?

1231
01:43:14,376 --> 01:43:15,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything, Loki?

1232
01:43:15,418 --> 01:43:16,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we don't have anything.

1233
01:43:16,419 --> 01:43:17,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then.

1234
01:43:17,621 --> 01:43:18,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1235
01:43:18,122 --> 01:43:19,224
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap it up here.

1236
01:43:19,344 --> 01:43:25,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So I used to have this big spiel, I would say, at the end about trying to draw new listeners to the show and spread the word and all that.

1237
01:43:25,854 --> 01:43:32,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems a little weird at this point as the sun is going down, but I do want to use this point of the show to remind everybody.

1238
01:43:32,545 --> 01:43:34,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Our final show is going to be November 23rd.

1239
01:43:34,970 --> 01:43:37,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for 23 November, if you will.

1240
01:43:37,034 --> 01:43:38,917
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a joke there that I'm sure most of you will get.

1241
01:43:38,937 --> 01:43:41,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's as close to the other numbers as we could get, 23 November.

1242
01:43:42,464 --> 01:43:46,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope you'll be able to join us for that live or podcast.

1243
01:43:46,893 --> 01:43:50,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And just a moment to thank everybody for their support over the last 23 and a half years.

1244
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,908
[SPEAKER_05]: As came up in that call with YYR right there, maybe it's not –

1245
01:43:54,888 --> 01:44:22,785
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1246
01:44:22,765 --> 01:44:25,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, that Cats Jellicle Ball.

1247
01:44:26,049 --> 01:44:26,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen this?

1248
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,391
[SPEAKER_05]: The ads for the Cats Jellicle Ball?

1249
01:44:28,772 --> 01:44:33,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're doing like the Paris is Burning 90s voguing culture ballroom thing.

1250
01:44:33,677 --> 01:44:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're doing it with cats.

1251
01:44:35,779 --> 01:44:38,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And as much as it's like, isn't cats kind of played out at this point?

1252
01:44:38,722 --> 01:44:41,185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, fuck, that's a really good pairing.

1253
01:44:41,205 --> 01:44:45,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So I actually really want to see that when it goes to Broadway because it's played off Broadway for a little bit.

1254
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the clips was really good.

1255
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:52,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I will have to do a trip to New York like sooner rather than later, to be quite honest.

1256
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,690
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1257
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:00,296
[SPEAKER_05]: We will not be here next week just due to day job and paycheck commitments.

1258
01:45:01,318 --> 01:45:03,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if DarkSakura is streaming next week.

1259
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,403
[SPEAKER_05]: My assumption is she will be.

1260
01:45:05,603 --> 01:45:07,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby will absolutely be here.

1261
01:45:07,226 --> 01:45:12,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So we hope those of you at the Voice Geeks Network will still be here at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern to support Bobby.

1262
01:45:12,733 --> 01:45:15,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, are you doing anything next Sunday with a week off?

1263
01:45:15,854 --> 01:45:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not, but the Sunday after that, I am going to be in a Minecraft competition event that's a charity fundraiser for cancer research.

1264
01:45:27,373 --> 01:45:33,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be Sunday morning, I think at 11 Pacific.

1265
01:45:34,433 --> 01:45:35,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember exactly.

1266
01:45:35,675 --> 01:45:36,516
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be on my socials.

1267
01:45:36,616 --> 01:45:39,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You are so smart using this time to do all these guest appearances.

1268
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:45,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's very exhausting, but I really hope that helps people get to know who you are.

1269
01:45:45,309 --> 01:45:49,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like I was telling some of my other cast members and stuff.

1270
01:45:49,995 --> 01:45:56,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's nice to get your foot in the door with some of this stuff, but like I don't necessarily enjoy these events.

1271
01:45:56,986 --> 01:45:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say like I don't want to sound elitist or anything.

1272
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like

1273
01:46:00,455 --> 01:46:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole point with trying to get in with certain groups is to be able to network with larger creators.

1274
01:46:08,173 --> 01:46:09,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not doing that here.

1275
01:46:09,456 --> 01:46:10,980
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not larger creators.

1276
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:16,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And while it's good to get to know some of these people, it's just not going to...

1277
01:46:16,132 --> 01:46:41,785
[SPEAKER_05]: help me open any doors small plus small might be still small but it's still it's larger than it was before and I think a really good comparison is probably like I think I look back at the history of this show and I think about when we came to all games radio you know we had an established community for years they had an established community for years neither one of them were huge you know uh but when we came together we there were a lot of people that found you

1278
01:46:41,765 --> 01:46:44,910
[SPEAKER_05]: something else kind of through that and, you know, it really works.

1279
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:49,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes it's just finding like that right partnership and that right match for the community ends up being a great thing.

1280
01:46:50,258 --> 01:46:57,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's more of like, you know, it's these type of events aren't necessarily, it's like different types of events that these guys put on.

1281
01:46:58,650 --> 01:46:59,672
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't

1282
01:46:59,652 --> 01:47:05,498
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more of like an MCC thing where it's just like you're playing through games and it's mostly like PvP and parkour and stuff like that.

1283
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:08,221
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some that are a little bit different than that.

1284
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:12,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know Legundo does this thing where it's like, I don't know if it's like flowers.

1285
01:47:12,945 --> 01:47:19,232
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something with flowers where you're getting flowers and it's also PvP at the same time.

1286
01:47:19,252 --> 01:47:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's that.

1287
01:47:20,052 --> 01:47:24,597
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another like Christmas event that Wadebox and...

1288
01:47:24,577 --> 01:47:52,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe an Orbitz that put on a while back as well where it's a lot of like oh you have all these challenges but they're like group challenges and you're all together you're not like doing PVP or anything it's more of just like hanging out in a group and there's a lot more like talking to people and getting to know them and like getting to like you know play with other creators like that's the type of like thing I'm looking to do whereas you know not to say that the last few things I've done haven't been

1289
01:47:52,640 --> 01:48:21,398
[SPEAKER_03]: it's good to get my foot in the door but the last one was playing Peak which is fine, Peak's fine but it's not Minecraft, I don't really want to, playing Blood on the Clock Tower which is fine, I don't really get the game and also once again not Minecraft and then other events where I'm participating in them but I can't make content from them because it's not interesting for content why am I making content for other people is what I'm trying to say I get that

1290
01:48:22,255 --> 01:48:23,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fine.

1291
01:48:23,317 --> 01:48:28,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll hopefully get me better opportunities in the future.

1292
01:48:29,609 --> 01:48:33,957
[SPEAKER_03]: These aren't quite the circles I'm looking to get into yet, but hopefully it'll be a subbing soon.

1293
01:48:34,578 --> 01:48:36,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1294
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with that, I need to get your actual final thought tonight, Loki.

1295
01:48:40,309 --> 01:48:41,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any final thoughts for us?

1296
01:48:41,965 --> 01:48:43,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to play Konamari this week.

1297
01:48:43,606 --> 01:48:44,207
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1298
01:48:44,607 --> 01:48:44,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1299
01:48:45,808 --> 01:48:48,271
[SPEAKER_05]: And my final thought is I'm going to play more Pokemon Legends.

1300
01:48:48,611 --> 01:48:54,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just say I had the absolute honor of hosting a show last night here in Sacramento with some drag monsters.

1301
01:48:54,556 --> 01:49:02,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had the Boulay brothers from their show Dragula and some of their monsters, Abora, Asia Consent, and who am I missing?

1302
01:49:02,323 --> 01:49:02,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Vandervan.

1303
01:49:02,764 --> 01:49:03,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1304
01:49:03,124 --> 01:49:04,105
[SPEAKER_05]: How did I forget Vandervan?

1305
01:49:04,846 --> 01:49:05,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all incredible.

1306
01:49:06,187 --> 01:49:08,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And the local, it was just such an incredible show to be a part of.

1307
01:49:08,809 --> 01:49:09,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just so happy for that.

1308
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:11,972
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really made me think, happy Halloween.

1309
01:49:11,952 --> 01:49:15,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It was such a creepy show in the best possible way.

1310
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a scene I've loved being a part of.

1311
01:49:18,318 --> 01:49:21,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am doing some more shows here locally in the Sacramento area.

1312
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:23,442
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a great one coming up this Friday.

1313
01:49:24,383 --> 01:49:25,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So check it out.

1314
01:49:25,064 --> 01:49:26,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky Horror is sold out, though.

1315
01:49:26,505 --> 01:49:30,289
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't have a ticket to that, it's the 50th anniversary.

1316
01:49:31,309 --> 01:49:33,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But go see it in your town with a cast.

1317
01:49:33,692 --> 01:49:36,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go see it at the fucking Multiplex.

1318
01:49:36,114 --> 01:49:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the same thing.

1319
01:49:37,555 --> 01:49:41,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Go see it with a cast in the worst part of your town.

1320
01:49:41,939 --> 01:49:43,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Go see it.

1321
01:49:43,561 --> 01:49:44,522
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to do it.

1322
01:49:44,542 --> 01:49:45,523
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1323
01:49:45,644 --> 01:49:46,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll be back.

1324
01:49:46,244 --> 01:49:47,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we won't be back next week.

1325
01:49:47,666 --> 01:49:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this is my chance to say happy Halloween.

1326
01:49:50,069 --> 01:49:50,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Halloween.

1327
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:51,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everybody has a great Halloween.

1328
01:49:52,012 --> 01:49:52,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Be safe.

1329
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:53,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Be fun.

1330
01:49:53,854 --> 01:49:56,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't be mean to each other.

1331
01:49:56,497 --> 01:50:00,883
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in two weeks back here with the final run of episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

1332
01:50:00,943 --> 01:50:02,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week, everybody.

1333
01:50:02,104 --> 01:50:04,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.

1334
01:50:04,467 --> 01:50:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1335
01:50:08,838 --> 01:50:36,229
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week.
