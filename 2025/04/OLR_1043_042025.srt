1
00:00:39,366 --> 00:00:41,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

2
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:45,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live.

4
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:59,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, tonight, April the 20th of 2025, you know, 420, with episode number 1043 of our show.

5
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,190
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week along with my co-hosts.

6
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:07,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

8
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

9
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:11,206
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are today.

10
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:12,189
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 420, you know.

11
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the big holiday was really yesterday.

12
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:17,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

13
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:19,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Your birthday.

14
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:23,460
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I could see where people might think it was a week ago because you did that subathon.

15
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, your actual birthday was yesterday.

16
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy Bappy.

17
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

18
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an infamous cat meme, and it's the only one that I know to send DarkSakura because it is her meme, basically, that says, no, it are my birthday with the cat trying to eat the birthday cake.

19
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So I texted Jamie that yesterday.

20
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:44,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you do anything special to celebrate?

21
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I went to San Francisco.

22
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dan and I went out for sushi.

23
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:50,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.

24
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,525
[SPEAKER_03]: We went out for sushi, Dan and I did, and then I saw Pride and Prejudice, which I had actually never seen the movie.

25
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:02,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to make it through the book, but I really don't care for Jane Austen's writing, I guess.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:06,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So we watched it.

28
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:07,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

29
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:16,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yesterday, my friend Alicia and I, y'all may know her in my chat as Mabel Von Smallcat.

30
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that name.

31
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:22,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to San Francisco and met up with JD.

32
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:25,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, I haven't seen him in a while.

33
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:26,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss his face.

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Sakura Matsuri and it was just so crowded.

35
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:34,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we got to see the cultural stuff, which is what we wanted to do.

36
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:43,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one makeup item I wanted wasn't there, so I was annoyed with that, but I got a lot of sheet masks and I picked up a new tea set for matcha.

37
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:44,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fun.

38
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with the whisk and the bowl and the scoop and everything.

39
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also...

40
00:02:53,224 --> 00:03:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: and got Unagi and then on the way back we were we were just like oh my god I'm tired oh my god I'm tired and I'm hungry I'm hungry so we stopped in Davis to try to find this kaiten sushi place that Dan and I had been to different occasions before the pandemic and we were hoping they were still open and it said the business was still there but when we found the business it looked like it was completely different there was nobody in there and

41
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,769
[SPEAKER_03]: The place was really neat.

42
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: They had really big pieces of their nigiri, and they had a wonderful unagi hand roll, and the roll that Alicia ordered was massive for what she paid for it.

43
00:03:38,929 --> 00:04:04,106
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mean it was really good and they had those dolls like I like to collect the traditional Japanese dolls with like the beautiful kimono and everything and I talked to the guy there and he's like yeah we used to be the Kaitenzushi place and then they had to close and they reopened as this place so I'm like well I'm glad you guys are still around I miss the Kaitenzushi but I'm glad that you're still here and you're doing well and who

44
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It was nice.

45
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of fun to just catch up and see that the business that I really liked evolved past the pandemic.

46
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:14,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was happy.

47
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:15,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

48
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:21,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And then came home and then when I got home, I was too keyed up again to really go to sleep.

49
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stayed up until I passed out in my chair and then it was good.

50
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

51
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:31,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Dan made breakfast this morning, although we had it at lunchtime and I'm like,

52
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it was kind of like an Easter thing.

53
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do Easter.

54
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Easter for us is just food.

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really Passover and sadly there wasn't a Seder for me to attend this year and I didn't really want to put on one myself.

56
00:04:49,645 --> 00:05:18,654
[SPEAKER_03]: so um so yeah and I have lots of snacky things that I will no longer be consuming after tomorrow because tomorrow is the end of my birthday weekend because I took two days off of work and um making your weekend a national holiday in other news I did find out about what really was going on with my leg oh so I did hurt my quad but what I actually tore was my hamstring

57
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to full on sports medicine.

58
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,749
[SPEAKER_03]: He ultrasounded my entire right leg.

59
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty interesting.

60
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I start physical therapy on Thursday with a focus on dance therapy.

61
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:40,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say no DDR for you, but in the future, yes.

62
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:43,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I can actually do DDR.

63
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:48,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the problem is the things that I can't do in ballet are things that require full extension.

64
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, there is a...

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:06:05,190
[SPEAKER_03]: A move called a developpe, where you're basically bringing your leg up in front of you, 90 degree or higher, you know, or to the side or to the back.

66
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:13,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only do that motion in attitude where your leg is a little bit bent, your knees bent, so it looks like it's crooked a bit.

67
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do it with the full extension.

68
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:16,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

69
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:17,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

70
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:49,805
[SPEAKER_03]: All the crap I did yesterday, though, didn't help.

71
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Treat yourself.

72
00:06:52,726 --> 00:07:01,868
[SPEAKER_06]: You are getting a lot of birthday love in the chat because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

73
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,148
[SPEAKER_06]: That's VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

74
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:06,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting.

75
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:12,369
[SPEAKER_06]: You went to San Francisco over the weekend yesterday because I'm going to San Francisco on Tuesday, but for a very different reason.

76
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,410
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see Kylie Minogue in concert.

77
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you not taking me?

78
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:38,138
[SPEAKER_06]: because tickets are expensive I could have paid for my ticket oh we bought them a long time ago I'm sorry but yeah well well fine I'm just gonna stay in my house honestly to Danny Minogue you could probably get a last minute ticket they always open up the day of okay now now now we're retreating

79
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:40,228
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

80
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's say hello to Techmaster Loki.

81
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:43,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

82
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,130
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

83
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing pretty good.

84
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,720
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you?

85
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

86
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:56,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Tired.

87
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I had another show last night, which was great.

88
00:07:58,843 --> 00:07:59,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so good.

89
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,084
[SPEAKER_06]: We had another show.

90
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We had probably the world's most famous drag king.

91
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:10,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Landon Sider was here performing with Nevermore Gorlesk, which I host a lot of their shows down at the Colonial here locally.

92
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:24,835
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was really great to meet Landon Sider and work with him and lots of great, you know, they'll bring in a big headliner but then there's, you know, a good at least 10, 12, probably a dozen local acts that they do.

93
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:32,557
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say local, I mean Bay Area, Northern California, up in the foothills that are all really good, you know, just some really cool like artistic stuff.

94
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a pleasure to host and do all that stuff, so.

95
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Once in a while, I'll be able to talk about games.

96
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:46,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Very rarely do I tell video game jokes, because it's not always that kind of crowd, but once in a while, I'll relate horror to Dead by Daylight, and I'll be like, who in the crowd plays Dead by Daylight?

97
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:50,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll make fun of it somehow, in a fun way.

98
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:57,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing is a good game to make fun of, too, and I see that's what you have playing behind you tonight, as we are taping live at VOG Network.

99
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you in an Animal Crossing mood today, or...?

100
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:03,459
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.

101
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, you know, we've been doing this this long.

102
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Start running out of games to put in there.

103
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:13,288
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was thinking about it because I'm getting... It just shipped.

104
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:16,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting a... What was it called?

105
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Retro Pocket Flip.

106
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:22,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to remember who the company puts it.

107
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:27,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's like... It's one of those emulation Android devices.

108
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:32,172
[SPEAKER_09]: and it can do emulation for GameCube.

109
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:34,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you were talking a little bit about this last week, yeah.

110
00:09:34,855 --> 00:09:41,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, GameCube, PlayStation, I mean, it goes pretty, this one is pretty powerful, so it goes pretty high up.

111
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:45,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You can even emulate some Switch games on it.

112
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So it kind of goes up to about that point.

113
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Because surely that's legal.

114
00:09:51,683 --> 00:10:11,160
[SPEAKER_09]: uh yeah i mean this it's limited switch homebrew switch homebrew switch like yeah yeah i'd say like switch indie games you know or you know e-shop stuff or something like that if you wanted to do that kind of thing but um mainly it was for uh i want to just like have kind of a cool handheld with like a

115
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:36,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the space nor the TV access to have a bunch of classic systems everywhere I have my Nintendo and that's about it and even that is sitting in a box somewhere I have all my games sitting in a cabinet getting dusty over here too, so I don't know Did I mention that Dan got me an Animal Crossing gift box full of stuff?

116
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:38,318
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's fine I've seen some of those

117
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:44,270
[SPEAKER_03]: has the keychain, the throat blanket, a bento box, a water bottle, a beanie, and a drawstring bag.

118
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:47,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait for them to announce a successor on Switch 2.

119
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:50,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to happen eventually, but it'll probably just be another year.

120
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:51,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe next year.

121
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:52,386
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

122
00:10:53,206 --> 00:11:00,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go to our chat room, and Rinmari's in chat tonight saying, I started poking at my Animal Crossing New Horizons island again.

123
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, it's fun to go back and revisit Animal Crossing once in a while.

124
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck, DarkSakura, you were playing Animal Forest for Hotmail.

125
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't the game crash unexpectedly?

126
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It got very frustrating?

127
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

128
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:26,320
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the emulation I use it's a little bit funky they are working on an E plus translation and I might try that one but

129
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted just to show off what the original one was like for people who had never seen it.

130
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've actually played a demo of it back in the day.

131
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,063
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some fundamental differences.

132
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:47,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the games, believe it or not, are in the N64 one.

133
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't have...

134
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the police station isn't there.

135
00:11:55,527 --> 00:12:00,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, in all the Japanese versions, instead of the well at town, you have a shrine.

136
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

137
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:09,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's some fundamental differences, but the N64 version is pretty fun.

138
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a channel I was following that has how the code in

139
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:27,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Because basically the GameCube version is really just the N64 version, just beefed up a bit.

140
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

141
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:35,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was one who goes through how sketch the code is and how you can easily manipulate it and crap like that.

142
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:45,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the sprite for Blathers, or not sprite, but the model for Blathers is in the N64 one, but there was no museum.

143
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not yet, yeah.

144
00:12:48,115 --> 00:13:11,614
[SPEAKER_03]: so you know that they had it planned it used to be that the way to get I want to say Ice Climber was you had to send your cartridge or your save or however you were saving it to Nintendo for the N64 they would transfer it over to a GameCube safe card and then send it back with Ice Climber in your inventory

145
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:21,074
[SPEAKER_06]: that's so convoluted like but no I mean that's what we did back then and that wasn't even that long ago the show was on the air when that was going on it's wild yeah

146
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:25,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'm looking at some other comments in chat, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

147
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:32,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We see Dolly Partner, hello, is in chat saying, or should I say yeehaw, saying, I just can't visit mine, talking about Animal Crossing.

148
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:34,701
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care too much about Tom Nook.

149
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:35,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, icons.

150
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Tom Nook is how children learn about capitalism these days.

151
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, Tom Nook is kind of like the original villain.

152
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see why, you know, people are a little hesitant.

153
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,646
[SPEAKER_06]: People might be a little triggered by Tom's presence.

154
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And he doesn't charge interest.

155
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that's true.

156
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:54,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll make him worse in the next game.

157
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,902
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I like to think that he does a good deed.

158
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, money is money.

159
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta pay back.

160
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,309
[SPEAKER_06]: When are they gonna let me put a guillotine in the town square?

161
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

162
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:07,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a warning shot.

163
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:08,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

164
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:15,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Justice for Tom Nook and Mr. Resetti.

165
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Resetti is on the spectrum, like me, and his comorbid is OCD.

166
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,745
[SPEAKER_03]: He's obsessed with resetting and doing things right.

167
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,087
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes things just the right way, just like me.

168
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: He has trouble with social situations, just like me.

169
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is true, Dolly.

170
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a better chance paying Tom Nook than my student loans, to be fair.

171
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

172
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:43,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

173
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:45,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to repay to pay off my student loans.

174
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you'll have to hope them student loans get forgiven.

175
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:50,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's one thing Tom Nook won't do, is forgive loans.

176
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So, good luck, good luck.

177
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Never forgives, never forgets.

178
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:56,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Except he never asks you to pay them back anytime soon.

179
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,182
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, that's true.

180
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:58,983
[SPEAKER_06]: You can live in the shack forever if you want.

181
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is that.

182
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:00,604
[SPEAKER_06]: You only get what?

183
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,886
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the gold Tom Nook statue or something, right?

184
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,547
[SPEAKER_06]: When you actually pay that off the last house?

185
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:05,868
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:47,954
[SPEAKER_03]: so he's he's actually a lot kinder hearted you know just tanuki are are business oriented individuals that's all all right that's why i mean and honestly you know the reason why he is a tanuki is because tanuki are supposed to symbolize uh profit in business makes sense makes sense that's why they have big testicles because they're like money bags

187
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's where I store all my money, so it makes sense to me.

188
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they call it a money shot?

189
00:15:56,218 --> 00:16:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on, let's talk about a game where, you know, maybe you don't have... This is an adult show, by the way.

190
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:15,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you don't have guillotines in Animal Crossing, but you certainly have decapitations in this next game, which, Loki, we've got, like, a rumor, but it's one of those things where it's like, this is beyond rumor at this point.

191
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,293
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, you know, when you've got the screenshots to prove the evidence, this is... Yeah, it's leaked out, basically.

192
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's happening.

193
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:22,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It...

194
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:39,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been rumored for a while, yeah, it's been rumored for a while that there's going to be an Oblivion remake, the fourth Elder Scrolls game, and now recently, as of, I believe it was last week, it got leaked onto...

195
00:16:42,472 --> 00:16:43,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, what was the website?

196
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:44,934
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a few things.

197
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:54,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So first off, it was reported through a LinkedIn profile that there was a new game being worked in or a port being worked in Unreal Engine 5.

198
00:16:55,004 --> 00:17:04,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Then later on, the actual screenshots got leaked out as well as part of like, I don't know if it was like some sort of like marketing as...

199
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:15,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Asset's website or something like that but essentially had side-by-side comparisons with the original game versus the remade game which looks pretty awesome.

200
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:20,037
[SPEAKER_09]: The rumor is it's supposed to be out very soon and this was...

201
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:24,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Sort of confirmed by the support bot.

202
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:32,109
[SPEAKER_09]: The Xbox support bot basically said that it's supposed to be out at the end or is at the release on April 21st.

203
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess we'll see.

204
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably soon.

205
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:36,931
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly coming.

206
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:42,424
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly coming, it's just like, when exactly are we actually going to see it?

207
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:45,166
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would imagine sooner than later.

208
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:55,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the 21st is tomorrow, so by the time most people hear this podcast, I mean, it should be up by the morning for people, but it'll probably already be out.

209
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:58,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what might be driving it.

210
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:03,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, usually stealth drops happen as some part of, like, larger announcements sort of thing.

211
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's just, it seems like a weird...

212
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:08,002
[SPEAKER_06]: reason to just stealth drop this game and nothing.

213
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:12,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are we getting maybe an Elder Scrolls 6 update that this will shadow drop alongside?

214
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

215
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:22,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't want to create expectations or something that's not there, but it is weird that this is being planned for a shadow drop when there's nothing else happening.

216
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

217
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:30,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost feels like something that would, like, you would want to hold on to until, like, say you had your Xbox showcase thing.

218
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

219
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'd be like, it's out now!

220
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:34,171
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like,

221
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,612
[SPEAKER_09]: type of thing, but I don't know.

222
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:43,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they want to be out now so they can make some extra bucks in this slow time of the year.

223
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:44,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Now available on Game Pass.

224
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:47,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they've been adding some heavy hitters to Game Pass lately.

225
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:52,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Diablo 3 finally went up on Game Pass, which that means 1, 3, and 4 are all on Game Pass.

226
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of time, I'm sure, before they get Diablo 2 Resurrected up there as well.

227
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:00,459
[SPEAKER_06]: They had that Blueprints game that's been everywhere.

228
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,220
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people have been really enjoying that game.

229
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:29,114
[SPEAKER_06]: that's up on Game Pass now too and I think it's on the PlayStation equivalent as well to be fair and then there's one other game that's escaped but I feel like there's like a lot of stuff that you know well there's the South of Midnight just came out what about a week ago that's a pretty big release too yeah so yeah there's a lot going on oh and you know what else is next week actually now I think about it Expedition 33 that whatever oh that's right yeah

230
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out in the next week.

231
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:33,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be a big week for releases.

232
00:19:33,078 --> 00:19:33,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.

233
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:35,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

234
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to kind of bring attention to where you were talking about that the bot kind of like spoiled the actual release date because this to me is a really funny side effect of all of these companies leaning so hard into AI.

235
00:19:50,643 --> 00:20:04,259
[SPEAKER_06]: and this is a really shining example I think of the you get what you pay for with the AI technology is that the AI is not going to understand that nuance of an NDA and if it has access to that sort of information it's going to put it out there.

236
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a really funny way that somebody figured out about this is by you know because

237
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:36,646
[SPEAKER_06]: companies are investing so much into AI before I really think it's ready or accurate that's what this is an accuracy issue is that the accurate thing would have been to tell that person that oh we haven't said anything about that yet but it can't understand that sort of nuance yet I mean yeah one could argue AI will get better AI will get there or something but you know one thing AI is incapable of is that whole emotion thing so I don't

238
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:37,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

239
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:45,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was a very interesting side effect that ought to have companies raising an eyebrow a little bit on how fast they implement AI.

240
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:49,569
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't, of course, but this is the price to pay for that.

241
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the article said it was like that supposedly on social media you get real-life people and all that stuff.

242
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I would bet that it's with an asterisk.

243
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you get real-life people at a certain point.

244
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:06,052
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean that you get it right out the gate or anything like that.

245
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranmari and Chat.

246
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't matter.

247
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, either way, they still leaked it out through the support system, whether it's a bot or not.

248
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe it could be third party that didn't know any better.

249
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:18,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

250
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,904
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you get what you pay for.

251
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:24,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranmari and Chat also says, I am very apprehensive of AI for a bunch of reasons.

252
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:25,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, same.

253
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:26,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't want to...

254
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:45,694
[SPEAKER_06]: We've gone deep in this AI topic previously, and the parts where it can be a decent thing, that's how we're going to get to 8K, 12K, whatever is in the future for graphics, is those sorts of tools that help to speed that process up with refining art.

255
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:50,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But that has to be something that's trained off of internal mechanisms and internal things, not things that are trained off of other people's

256
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,035
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

257
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,403
[SPEAKER_06]: People trying to replace these very complex mechanisms with AI, I think are in for a shock.

258
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:22,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm hearing in all these different industries about how AI is like replacing jobs already.

259
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:28,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of those, these, they're going to get what they pay for with those cutting those sets of corners.

260
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Typically, that's the case.

261
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:33,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's how you have AI negotiating a car.

262
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:34,554
[SPEAKER_09]: What was it?

263
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Buying a car for a dollar?

264
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:40,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're like, you know.

265
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you not say thank you yet?

266
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:08,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Rin Mari also says, my biggest fear is AI being used for deep fakes and spinning false narratives.

267
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, once in a while, once in a blue moon, there's a funny one, but it's like, it's one of those like AI that's so bad, it's good.

268
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:20,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was one with the whole, you know, Katy Perry in space was all the rage this week, right?

269
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:21,815
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

270
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:44,687
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I do agree that like that shit's going to become very problematic very fast.

271
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:52,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably going to take a lawsuit, several lawsuits of somebody being shown doing something that they aren't actually doing.

272
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:57,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And that taking steam in a major way for that to come to head.

273
00:23:58,053 --> 00:23:58,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

274
00:23:59,373 --> 00:23:59,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

275
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:00,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

276
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:02,873
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

277
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,196
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do I want to say about the Oblivion remake?

278
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:08,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, are you going to... Would you play it when it comes out, Loki?

279
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

280
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of the games... One of my launch games I had for the 360.

281
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:16,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it as much as Skyrim.

282
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping, though, like...

283
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:23,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd probably be more interested in playing it on PC when it comes out, especially with all the modding and everything.

284
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that'd be fun.

285
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

286
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:36,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting that the mod, there is a mod already that makes this HD, but apparently the mod creators had somewhat good spirits about it, I guess.

287
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, kind of realized that one of these HD remakes would be inevitable at some point, so...

288
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:43,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

289
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:44,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

290
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:45,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

291
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,020
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

292
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:48,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

293
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:49,502
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

294
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:49,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

295
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:56,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, my ex played Oblivion way too much and the music still gives me flashbacks to this day.

296
00:24:56,946 --> 00:24:57,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

297
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:00,190
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

298
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:21,829
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

299
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I played like half a minute of this Sailor Moon beat-em-up in the little arcade.

300
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:59,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some gachapon machines and, you know, some stuff like that.

301
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly it's been Dead by Daylight trying to get through the event.

302
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:08,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to be doing some Killer tonight since I don't work tomorrow.

303
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, you know, the Swiftmates decide to come play.

304
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:15,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm really overdue for a play date.

305
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to get in on that sometime.

306
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:20,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you keep inviting me and I'm always, I've just been so like, it's weird.

307
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:23,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually been leaving the house and shit lately.

308
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a weird feeling, but I really want to play with you again sometime.

309
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:27,811
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to have much longer for this event.

310
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:28,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

311
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:31,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it's not like the game's going anywhere, but yeah.

312
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:36,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I, I mostly, you know, my thing is getting all the cosmetics and stuff.

313
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

314
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, uh, I played Pollya.

315
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:48,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I have almost finished my second property, which is a little witch in the woods kind of thing.

316
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:52,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I've learned how to do some design glitching.

317
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:59,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have like some, some furniture merges and a few things out of bounds and it's pretty cool so far, you know?

318
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:00,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

319
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:05,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lamp growing out of the ground and the lamp is kind of like tree-ish.

320
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks really like it is growing out of the ground.

321
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool.

322
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:11,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing Fruit Mountain.

323
00:27:11,432 --> 00:27:16,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally topped my 7,000 point score and got one over 8,000 points.

324
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:17,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really nice.

325
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing my stupid Mahjong game.

326
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing the Suika game.

327
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little Mass Effect.

328
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fun.

329
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:37,830
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm actually, yeah, Mass Effect right now is probably qualifying as my Retro Knight question mark in Terabang.

330
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It counts.

331
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:42,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been enjoying it.

332
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:43,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's fun.

333
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:52,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I might... Palia is supposed to be getting an update with a new area on March 13th.

334
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:56,513
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be playing a shit ton of Palia when that happens.

335
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:58,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

336
00:27:58,614 --> 00:27:59,134
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we are.

337
00:27:59,614 --> 00:27:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

338
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we'll move on to Loki in your gaming week.

339
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:06,918
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

340
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Minecraft, as usual.

341
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:10,721
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you got a new video.

342
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:11,902
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been cranking out the videos lately.

343
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:12,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

344
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven weeks in a row.

345
00:28:14,284 --> 00:28:14,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

346
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:24,632
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to slow down here eventually, but yeah, it's been easy to do because I've just been building farms and stuff, so it's pretty quick.

347
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,074
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, seven weeks in a row now.

348
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:31,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it's just... I feel like your videos are getting some good views, too.

349
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:32,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, lately.

350
00:28:33,135 --> 00:28:34,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're getting 1,000, 2,000.

351
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:36,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good for you.

352
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it comes and goes, though.

353
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:41,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the next episode I put out could just...

354
00:28:43,218 --> 00:28:44,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a few views.

355
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,059
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

356
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that views are everything.

357
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, God knows we've done this show for as long.

358
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,024
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, it's nice.

359
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:53,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

360
00:28:53,605 --> 00:28:54,946
[SPEAKER_06]: You work very hard on it.

361
00:28:55,426 --> 00:29:02,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that... And I know that views are a metric that helps you get ads and money and that type of stuff.

362
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:06,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do feel like you deserve that type of reward on YouTube.

363
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:07,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a lot of people do.

364
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: But you especially.

365
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:10,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm biased, okay?

366
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:11,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how hard you work.

367
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's watch time right now is what we need to get up because there isn't a whole lot of watch time.

368
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:27,228
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people like finding it or it's getting pushed and then they're like, oh, hey, you know, and then they're like, ah, this is not for me.

369
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:35,254
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to push play and then go walk and do something or set up the favorite demo computers at Best Buy to be watching.

370
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

371
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

372
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:36,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that.

373
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:38,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I want to get him in trouble.

374
00:29:38,997 --> 00:29:39,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But

375
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:43,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, stream it in the background a little bit while you clean the house.

376
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:45,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll get there eventually.

377
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:51,228
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably going to take something outside of the SMP stuff that I've been doing with Channel 64.

378
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:57,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Because usually you get a larger audience with a single player series or...

379
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:26,054
[SPEAKER_09]: modded or who knows so eventually I'll get there um I need to get to a point now where I'm doing a lot more planning and build designing and stuff so that's where it's gonna slow down it's not gonna be just making weekly episodes of stuff but you know I'm hoping to still be able to break up some of those projects a bit more because that was something I've struggled with for the past few seasons so we shall see if I can do that um but hopefully I can and then

380
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:31,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think the movie is bringing some eyes back to the Minecraft creation?

381
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Not to me, because they're never pushing my stuff.

382
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,004
[SPEAKER_09]: They're pushing the people that already have an audience, their things.

383
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're getting Hermitcraft folks.

384
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:49,012
[SPEAKER_09]: To be fair though, one of them at least, he was working on...

385
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:52,429
[SPEAKER_09]: He was working with them on pre-production.

386
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:57,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So he designed all of the stuff in the world.

387
00:30:57,915 --> 00:31:01,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the Redstone stuff, they brought him in as a consultant to do all that.

388
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:02,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was pretty cool.

389
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:09,467
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's a lot of... It's always the big creators that get the same...

390
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:26,191
[SPEAKER_09]: focus on all like the Minecraft stuff despite the fact that you know they have said several times hey shout out those small creators and we'll do blah blah blah you know do something with it and then it's like and so then I get like an attitude and be like I thought you said you're gonna do something with this.

391
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won the Mega Man contest?

392
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:29,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won the Mega Man contest?

393
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:36,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you were gonna do something like this you keep asking for small creators and you do nothing with it so like why am I gonna waste my effort to

394
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:55,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep shouting out the same creators, especially when they're, like, small creators, and people are like, Grian, Mumbo Jumbo, it's like, they have 5 million plus views, or subs, they're not small, they're at the top, like, they're not unheard of, like, creators, like...

395
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,139
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just funny.

396
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100Matt in chat says, I did get to see the movie.

397
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:01,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot better than I expected.

398
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:03,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have not seen the movie.

399
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't get out to the movies very often, which is a running theme on this show, so hey.

400
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else, Loki?

401
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:15,125
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week.

402
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:18,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've actually picked up Final Fantasy XIV again.

403
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:21,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working on getting my machinist to level 100.

404
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I've finally been working on the patch content.

405
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:28,653
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually really excited that we're finally getting an update to the game on Tuesday.

406
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:33,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a mini patch, but it's bringing the crafting gathering stuff, which tends to be...

407
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:43,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't super get into crafting gathering, but I like the little competitive stuff that they put in that makes it more engaging and more interesting and gives you things to build for tickets and things like that.

408
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited for that to hit the game on Tuesday.

409
00:32:48,061 --> 00:32:51,302
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of like everything we were just saying earlier.

410
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:51,802
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that.

411
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:52,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Expedition 33.

412
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:55,003
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much fucking hitting this week.

413
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:56,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty crazy.

414
00:32:56,963 --> 00:32:57,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm excited for that.

415
00:32:58,704 --> 00:32:59,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been playing that.

416
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I also, I don't think I talked about this last week, but I played a little bit last week and I played again this week.

417
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually bought Tetris Grandmaster 4 on Steam.

418
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:10,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, that's from all of you hyping it.

419
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:20,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the Tetris hype I was getting a little bit from when I played the Gold Master Collection, the Tetris one that Digital Eclipse did.

420
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:31,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot the actual name of that Tetris collection, the Tetris story or whatever that was, that actually explained a little bit of the differences on where Grandmaster came from.

421
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Tetris forever, Bobby.

422
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:39,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Where that came from and why it's different and why people are really into the Grandmaster and stuff.

423
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of knew some of it.

424
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:41,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew it played a little differently.

425
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:43,243
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

426
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:15,048
[SPEAKER_06]: with a big asterisk because overall the game has some really mean, nasty, fast modes where it's like insta-drops, insta-drops, and you have to click things into place fast.

427
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's wild.

428
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild.

429
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,291
[SPEAKER_06]: RinMari says, I hate T-spin meta.

430
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:21,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer to spam Tetrises all day.

431
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the way I play too.

432
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:27,919
[SPEAKER_06]: My brain is not thinking in a T-spin way yet, and maybe I need to watch some tutorials on how to do it.

433
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: That would probably up my game.

434
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,361
[SPEAKER_06]: That helped me on my Luminous game.

435
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:58,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched maybe 30 minutes of how to be a better Luminous player and once I started learning the trick about using like the three and one blocks and like using the nubs to create like squares and in the places where you needed them and stuff I was like oh my god I I can go a full round on Luminous now it only took me just kind of like seeing the game in a new way to do that so I need to do the same thing with Tetris quite honestly um but yeah I'm enjoying Grandmaster there is an interesting mode where all the blocks become big and

436
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,060
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

437
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:18,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It thinks through the holds way faster than I do when I play Tetris.

438
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:27,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that's my problem, too, is that I pretty much only put the straight line... Like, I'm sure a lot of you, you put the straight line brick in the hold, and then you kind of wait for it, and then you use that.

439
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe once in a while, like, if there's a Z brick that doesn't make sense, I'll throw that in the hold until I see an opportunity.

440
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:34,707
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that whole type of thing.

441
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:37,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But my God, playing that mode, which Ranmari says is...

442
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:44,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Kanoa Mode, which teaches you how to do that.

443
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:52,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh my god, the way you have to go back and forth with the holds is wild.

444
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:55,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have that brain capacity for Tetris.

445
00:35:56,118 --> 00:36:14,630
[SPEAKER_06]: so no wonder people prefer the NES version because it doesn't have a fucking hold but I do overall I like the hold mechanic I do I do so I'm just but yeah I've been playing Grandmaster 4 so congrats chat congrats chat you did it you did it you finally convinced me to get something that I got sucked into it's actually I will say where that game is really fun you

446
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,972
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a grown ass man.

447
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,734
[SPEAKER_01]: You made that decision all on your own.

448
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:20,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and to be fair, I've always kind of had a soft spot for Tetris, right?

449
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Tetris Forever, Tetris Effect.

450
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:23,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved them both.

451
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:29,632
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, but y'all hyped up Grandmaster and I was like, all right, I should get on this bandwagon already.

452
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:30,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought of another game I played.

453
00:36:31,053 --> 00:36:31,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, you reminded me.

454
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:32,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I played some Luminous.

455
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:53,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

456
00:36:53,852 --> 00:36:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that's a classic.

457
00:36:54,853 --> 00:36:55,454
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorites.

458
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,214
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my all-time favorites.

459
00:36:58,136 --> 00:37:00,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Alan and I have been doing a lot of walking.

460
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:06,524
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been having a walking challenge at work and just generally we've been trying to like be better about health and stuff like that and just get out walking.

461
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:07,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you.

462
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:10,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So like Pikmin Bloom is all about walking, right?

463
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:15,393
[SPEAKER_06]: So we blew through that because Alan and I have both been trying to walk like four or five miles a day.

464
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:18,035
[SPEAKER_06]: We blew through the flower challenge.

465
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,456
[SPEAKER_06]: We have like a tradition.

466
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:34,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever since I got Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs. Blackwolf into Pikmin Bloom, nearly every week, unless I forget or something goes awry, nearly every week I get the four of us into a flower planting challenge where you have to, as a group, plant 30,000 flowers.

467
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:37,449
[SPEAKER_06]: You plant flowers by walking and turning it on, turning it off.

468
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:38,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot less...

469
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,271
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

470
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we keep getting all these tickets.

471
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And Alan and I were like, should we do a second one?

472
00:38:06,696 --> 00:38:07,116
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did.

473
00:38:07,437 --> 00:38:10,400
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a second flower challenge by ourselves.

474
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:11,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the two of us.

475
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:13,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We had it open to see if anybody else would join.

476
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:14,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody else joined.

477
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,207
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a second challenge by ourselves.

478
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:18,849
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

479
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:49,681
[SPEAKER_06]: and I knew this was going to happen because every other fucking Niantic game and we're not talking about the sale that sale hasn't closed by the way so there's a lot of fans out there that are saying it's Scopely's influence this is what Scopely's doing Scopely Scopely Scopely it hasn't closed

480
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:58,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all, it's just been announced, but it's got a clear... So right now, at least, it is still Niantic's choices and all that stuff.

481
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:01,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They have been doing all of these battles.

482
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So Monster Hunter now, I think, was the first one that had a battle pass.

483
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:13,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Pikmin Bloom's whole mechanic, it's not as battle pass-y, but it kind of feels like it, like the way they've kind of instituted in that game.

484
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:14,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

485
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:19,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Go has figured out a way to Battle Pass during special events.

486
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,562
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do points for catching Pokemon and all this stuff and all that.

487
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:26,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And now Ingress has it too.

488
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:30,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, well, this is just a matter of time because literally every other Niantic game has figured out how to Battle Pass.

489
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:33,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So what they're doing is for Anomaly Seasons...

490
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:36,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Now all the badges run off points.

491
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get points by doing bounties, which a lot of this shit is new to Ingress.

492
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: They've only put it in the last couple years.

493
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You do these bounties.

494
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:48,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like capture two portals, walk two kilometers, throw one field.

495
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,660
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you do these things for points.

496
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And those points go into the Anomaly Season, which runs for like two or three months.

497
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get these rewards as you hit certain levels, including a different tiered badge for the Anomaly Season.

498
00:40:00,027 --> 00:40:00,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough...

499
00:40:01,348 --> 00:40:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

500
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:20,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible.

501
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:22,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Terrible value, in my opinion.

502
00:40:22,998 --> 00:40:29,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you get 25 Aegis shields, which are the most powerful shields in the game, but it's like, hack them, lazy.

503
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Go hack.

504
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Learn to overclock.

505
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:35,725
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to buy a battle pass to get 25 Aegis shields.

506
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:41,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Rinmari in chat says, to be honest, I don't care for the licensed GPS games.

507
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:44,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Ingress because it has original lore.

508
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:47,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember going to an Anomaly event in SF in 2013.

509
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:48,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the social element.

510
00:40:49,168 --> 00:40:50,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, I think I was at that event.

511
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least I was at one, maybe 2018 was when I went to San Francisco Anomaly.

512
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:56,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the in-person events are a lot of fun.

513
00:40:56,814 --> 00:41:00,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I like Ingress because it's never dull, because of the player versus player element.

514
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:03,639
[SPEAKER_06]: As frustrating as that can be sometimes, because it's like...

515
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,485
[SPEAKER_06]: That fucking retired guy that plays all fucking day long came and took down my fucking portals and threw a field.

516
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:16,493
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as frustrating as that whole thing can be, it's one of those things where it's like, but like, it's like motivating for me to get it back out, walk and just fucking throw it again.

517
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:18,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's never a dull moment.

518
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:19,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

519
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps me, it keeps me on my toes.

520
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:21,958
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

521
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:22,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a good time.

522
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, the social events are a lot of fun, but I still fear...

523
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,143
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

524
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:55,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be what Niantic is going in to train their world awareness, you know, AR stuff that they can build AR gaming off of.

525
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the long term plan.

526
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to build what the world looks like to help with AR gaming and all that crap.

527
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,649
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be interesting.

528
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm curious how Ingress and Scanaverse that are almost certainly likely to fuse together is going to get them there.

529
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:16,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, enough talk about a game very few of you play, but I do think it's very influential in that AR gaming space, and it is worth keeping an eye on.

530
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:22,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, without it, you would have never got Pokemon Go, which took over the world in 2016 and, you know, still does very well for itself.

531
00:42:22,798 --> 00:42:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And Pikmin Bloom, Monster Hunter Now, both really decent games if you give them a try.

532
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:28,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk about them for a reason.

533
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy them.

534
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:29,960
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

535
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it, Rob.

536
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:31,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it, Rob.

537
00:42:31,561 --> 00:42:31,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it, Rob.

538
00:42:54,298 --> 00:43:00,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo had halted pre-orders on the Nintendo Switch 2, which was originally supposed to take place on April 9th.

539
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But now we have the new date.

540
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It will launch April 24th.

541
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:09,323
[SPEAKER_09]: This has also been confirmed by other partner retailers as well.

542
00:43:09,343 --> 00:43:14,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Target shows that theirs are going to go up midnight Eastern on the 24th.

543
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:38,654
[SPEAKER_09]: of course the two versions that will be available the system by itself and then of course the bundle with Mario Kart World for $4.99 now the console prices have stayed the same but the accessories have gone up and so now the accessories are going to be even more expensive so the Switch 2 Pro Controller went up $5 from $80 to $85 Joy-Con 2's are now $95 instead of $90

544
00:43:43,596 --> 00:43:47,281
[SPEAKER_09]: The crappy camera is $55 instead of $50.

545
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that kind of sucks.

546
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,954
[SPEAKER_09]: But you don't necessarily need all that stuff.

547
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,838
[SPEAKER_09]: You can wait for a sale maybe.

548
00:44:00,103 --> 00:44:14,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he can wait for this cockadoody tariff stuff to, you know, for you-know-who in charge to change his mind again or somebody to slap some sense into him or something where they realize that this whole thing was a very, very bad idea.

549
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:16,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know...

550
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it with a grain of salt.

551
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:41,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It will change the day after.

552
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

553
00:44:44,097 --> 00:44:50,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Deft in chat says, you know, that's a good part of this is that you don't really need any of these accessories if you already have Switch One stuff.

554
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where I'm at.

555
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really need that camera.

556
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,074
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cute idea, but sure, you know.

557
00:44:56,434 --> 00:45:19,410
[SPEAKER_09]: they like was that they were showing off they did like a funny little bit because you know Paul Rudd was in the original Super Nintendo um console control um commercial and so now they had him reprise that role or whatever for the Switch 2 and they were just showing off like Mario Kart uh world gameplay and the camera and just like the the

558
00:45:20,612 --> 00:45:23,636
[SPEAKER_09]: The screen sharing type stuff that's going on.

559
00:45:23,676 --> 00:45:25,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks so bad.

560
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:27,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the games look good.

561
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,423
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea of chatting with your friends look good.

562
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:30,824
[SPEAKER_09]: But that screen share thing.

563
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Just... They should have just cut it out.

564
00:45:33,711 --> 00:45:36,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, it's not necessary because it looks awful.

565
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:45,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks... It looks like when we first used... I mean, granted, when we first used to stream this show, like, it was one frame every 10 seconds.

566
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

567
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:48,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But eventually, it wasn't great either.

568
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:51,647
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like, you know, 12 frames per second or something like that.

569
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:53,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

570
00:45:54,448 --> 00:45:55,409
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 years ago.

571
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,391
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still archive video from 2006.

572
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:07,177
[SPEAKER_06]: There's us playing the Final Fantasy XIII demo on our fucking cable internet connection in the old garage studio.

573
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:11,199
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an Orange Lounge Twitch channel out there.

574
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,323
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't used it in a very long time, but there's archive footage still there to this day from way back when.

575
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:18,224
[SPEAKER_09]: It just looks so bad.

576
00:46:18,364 --> 00:46:20,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

577
00:46:20,506 --> 00:46:23,748
[SPEAKER_09]: The voice chat stuff's good, but man, that does not represent

578
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:26,010
[SPEAKER_09]: The console very well.

579
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:31,935
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have just cut that feature because it wasn't really necessary and it's half-baked.

580
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:33,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But the rest is fine.

581
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,579
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a Mario Kart Direct, which is kind of cool.

582
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,380
[SPEAKER_09]: They got the show off.

583
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:44,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So the classic tracks are remixed and mixed in the world as well, so that's kind of neat.

584
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:50,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a bunch of new weapons and stuff, new items in the boxes that you can do, so that's pretty cool.

585
00:46:52,659 --> 00:47:03,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm excited about the game, but like, man, that commercial just did not do that camera and that feature justice at all.

586
00:47:03,749 --> 00:47:05,030
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just awful.

587
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:05,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe it did.

588
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:07,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just an awful feature.

589
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:15,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, going back to the talk about Washington being unpredictable.

590
00:47:15,827 --> 00:47:20,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay Helinski in chat says, I predicted there is insider trading going on in D.C.

591
00:47:20,628 --> 00:47:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a safe bet that you can know.

592
00:47:23,249 --> 00:47:24,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one bet I would take.

593
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Corruption in my administration?

594
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:29,732
[SPEAKER_09]: There's already evidence of it.

595
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:30,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Centipedes?

596
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:50,758
[SPEAKER_09]: it's just because you see oh hey look at that that's weird there's like heavy trading right before the announcement of this this thing happens that's so strange that it just so happened to be that these people traded all these stocks right before you know this announcement made that they would certainly be aware of hmm

597
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:57,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I will definitely try to get a Nintendo Switch 2.

598
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:02,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that the price isn't going up, all things considered.

599
00:48:02,808 --> 00:48:09,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that Nintendo is taking a somewhat calculated risk that they have enough stock in the warehouses to help kind of see them through for a little bit.

600
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:19,518
[SPEAKER_06]: That maybe they don't have to bring any more over until hopefully this whole thing, you know, somebody fucking gets the president to attack dog something else and go back on this tariff thing.

601
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:26,760
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, or or or heaven forbid, Congress fucking step in and say, which, by the way, they could do tomorrow.

602
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:33,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow, Congress could step in and say, actually, Congress could well, actually, this entire thing.

603
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:34,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually.

604
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:36,583
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not an emergency.

605
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:41,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the president has rights to declare these tariffs when there's an emergency.

606
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:44,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But Congress can step in and say... It's not even an emergency.

607
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:47,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It's when we're at war, which we are not at war.

608
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,552
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're like, oh, we're fighting the war on fentanyl.

609
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

610
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:54,934
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're waiting for.

611
00:48:54,954 --> 00:48:59,637
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're waiting for Congress to do is say, well, actually, there's not a war.

612
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:01,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So null and void.

613
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:04,080
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do it tomorrow.

614
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:08,972
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

615
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:42,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then you also have to, you figure too, you know, some of these corporations do want this kind of stuff to happen.

616
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:54,627
[SPEAKER_09]: They want people to not be able to afford things so that they can swoop in or assuming that basically he tanks the market, they swoop it in and get a deal on all these stocks and then the market eventually recovers.

617
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: But they, you know, were able to swoop in and acquire more wealth.

618
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:04,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so, but anyway, I will get a Switch 2, but the accessories can wait.

619
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:12,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wanted to get a Pro Controller, but I'm not, like, I'm just fundamentally against paying for these things wherever I can prevent it.

620
00:50:13,032 --> 00:50:20,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't, as much as I love doing this show, video games are not a necessity, and I can cut that out to avoid this.

621
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:22,755
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, other things like groceries and shit,

622
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:27,017
[SPEAKER_06]: and things that are imported from other countries that, you know, are in salads and shit like that.

623
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:27,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to have a choice.

624
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:32,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But where I can cut it out and do that stuff, you know, is going to make sense.

625
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just what I'm going to have to do.

626
00:50:34,502 --> 00:50:34,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

627
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:41,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, in that segment, Loki was talking a little bit about a Mario Kart World Direct.

628
00:50:41,466 --> 00:50:43,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, a Mario Kart World Direct.

629
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:44,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It did happen this week as well.

630
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: This was their opportunity to show why this game is worth $80.

631
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's an opinion.

632
00:50:52,893 --> 00:50:57,216
[SPEAKER_06]: If this game is worth $80, that's your question to answer.

633
00:50:58,877 --> 00:51:05,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the features that they were showing were things like the Grand Prix races, knockout tours, battle mode, free roam.

634
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:08,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course we know there's an interconnected world, right?

635
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:14,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know it's like a big open world, kind of like a Forza game, but for Mario Kart, which again, that's no shade.

636
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza Horizon is a fucking high bar in racing, and the fact that Mario is taking inspiration from that is a good thing.

637
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where that innovating in the genre stuff, that's great.

638
00:51:26,852 --> 00:51:27,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no problem with that.

639
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:35,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe I have a problem with all of these things being in one game leading to that high price, but...

640
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:39,177
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's for Nintendo to figure out, you know.

641
00:51:39,217 --> 00:51:44,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Forza was at $90, so I'm kind of confused as to why this one is.

642
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: True.

643
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but you say that, but...

644
00:51:49,875 --> 00:52:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza had a game of the year edition, or not a game of the year, an early access advanced launch where you could play the game early and had the super bundle of the game that included both season passes, which were an additional, what, 15, 20 bucks on top of that and all this other stuff.

645
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:11,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do somewhat have an issue because it goes back to that whole thing when it's like, well, these other games are cheap, but it's like, well, are they?

646
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're not really giving you the full thing out the gate.

647
00:52:15,146 --> 00:52:24,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but then also, are we going to really believe, like, we're going to sit here and believe that Nintendo's never going to release any sort of DLC for this game?

648
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,431
[SPEAKER_09]: It's complete as is.

649
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:27,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

650
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:29,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no.

651
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in the character department, for sure.

652
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:33,693
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

653
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Then of course you can just do free roam.

654
00:52:58,901 --> 00:53:01,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Just roam around the world and do whatever the hell you want.

655
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:02,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

656
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:06,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that's like, you know, that's why people loved Zelda Breath of the Wild, right?

657
00:53:06,164 --> 00:53:07,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lot of that free open stuff.

658
00:53:07,305 --> 00:53:11,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that there's collectibles in the game.

659
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:12,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's cool.

660
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:17,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That very much feels like... You mean like barns with cars in them type of thing?

661
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yes, that too.

662
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:21,351
[SPEAKER_09]: But now I'm talking about like... Billboards to drive through?

663
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:21,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

664
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, more Burnout Paradise.

665
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:23,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

666
00:53:23,832 --> 00:53:25,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotcha, I gotcha.

667
00:53:25,353 --> 00:53:27,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a staple of the genre and all that.

668
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:31,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Battle Mode is going to be back, which is, you know, fun.

669
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:34,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That was always fun on the classic... The classic Super Nintendo one was great.

670
00:53:35,356 --> 00:53:37,937
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 24 racers at a time, as we know.

671
00:53:38,697 --> 00:53:43,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Chat, they're talking about, and camera play and all that stuff, if that's of interest to you.

672
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:44,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of characters.

673
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:47,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're talking about all these things in the direct.

674
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:51,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, like, I'm going to pick up the bundled version.

675
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, we're assuming that they're going to be relatively easy to get if you're on there at midnight.

676
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure that's going to be the case.

677
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I think many people are kind of going, okay, I'm going to try to get the target.

678
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:03,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

679
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:04,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-order.

680
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:05,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Scalpers, for sure.

681
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:08,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to try to get this pre-order.

682
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:09,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully one of them comes through.

683
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:11,768
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

684
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of scalpers, let's go to what DarkSakura has to talk about.

685
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,760
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

686
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:34,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know scalpers are gonna scalp, but Japanese retailers have actually been reaching out to ask the public what they would suggest for combating scalpers.

687
00:54:35,788 --> 00:54:35,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And

688
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:46,946
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them put out a social media post that said Nojima Online was asking people what their ideas were.

689
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:57,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And one user, Tatsuya, said to make customer show identification, open the instruction manual, the inside of the box, protected plastic, et cetera, write their names on it.

690
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And another one said that selling the console out of the case

691
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: making customers sign a warranty in their own name, quizzing people on Nintendo knowledge another user was saying had to state what about the Twitch 2 makes them want to buy it honestly enough it's a slim at one console per person I mean, or one or two but if you've got like a group of people who are acquiring them for resale

692
00:55:36,006 --> 00:55:59,754
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different story I do like the idea of them being serialized and having the serial number registered This is my idea anyway Having the serial number registered to the buyer Interesting Yeah, but gifts and stuff I mean, I don't know

693
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:06,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, then they also would mark that this is a gift and who the recipient is.

694
00:56:08,995 --> 00:56:09,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose.

695
00:56:09,855 --> 00:56:18,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, so that it has to be registered or even like some sort of biometric scanner, I don't know.

696
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:31,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, in the end, what somebody does with what they buy is up to them, but there's only so much one can do to limit

697
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:34,614
[SPEAKER_03]: those purchases.

698
00:56:36,495 --> 00:56:54,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that at least making them serialized and having serial numbers registered to the buyer and that way as well or even for the resale sites make a requirement for them that they have to post the serial number at time of sale.

699
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:00,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can think of.

700
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:04,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, or just let people fight about it in the parking lot.

701
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:04,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

702
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:06,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

703
00:57:06,377 --> 00:57:07,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking in- Fight clope, yeah.

704
00:57:07,317 --> 00:57:08,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

705
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:13,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, OrangeRiteChat says, one scalper showing up with various glasses and fake mustaches.

706
00:57:13,238 --> 00:57:13,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

707
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:19,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, SSJ100Matt, I think with the best point here is the best way to combat scalpers is to not buy from them.

708
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them go broke.

709
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:27,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the wrong people are not hearing the- or the- the- like, the people hearing that message are not the people that need to hear that message.

710
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumerism will win every time.

711
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:31,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, which is unfortunate.

712
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:37,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have to state right now that the use of slippery slope as an argument is inherently fallacious.

713
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:44,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really talk to an argument about that since it's based on speculation.

714
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they should be under some kind of DRM.

715
00:57:53,991 --> 00:58:00,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Jay Helinski in chat says it's a slippery slope because it could very quickly turn into a DRM.

716
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:05,738
[SPEAKER_06]: In the end, in a consumerist market,

717
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to give the consumer the demand.

718
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:24,128
[SPEAKER_03]: If the demand isn't there from the original source, then they're going to go to the secondary market.

719
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:42,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I sort of think this is why I think Nintendo's way of how they're selling it on their official, because that's the one thing we haven't heard the pre-order details from, and I think might be out of sight, out of mind for some people, is that Nintendo is also selling them directly through their own warehouse or whatever channels, and they're requiring you to have a Nintendo Online.

720
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:54,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they require the subscription, but you have to have an online account and at least 50 hours registered in playing games before the day they announced it, which, you know, people that play enough video games regularly

721
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:55,536
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

722
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:10,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Buy can't measure to that.

723
00:59:10,782 --> 00:59:12,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Target can't measure to that.

724
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:15,085
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only something that Nintendo can do first party.

725
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:24,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that was the only way to get a Switch, then it would turn into a whole antitrust thing because they sort of have to release some stock the other ways as well.

726
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:26,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wonder if there's going to be a lot.

727
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:30,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if it's going to be that situation where there's like one or two of them per Target.

728
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kind of assuming, I think, a lot of people that there's going to be a lot of them.

729
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be better than that.

730
00:59:35,521 --> 01:00:03,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope so I hope so but what was it didn't they release something where it was like there was four of them was it those NES classes or something people were just and it was like oh a store would get like four of them five of them maybe but like yeah I think there's obviously they're gonna make sure there's enough stock I mean that's the whole whole thing I can't imagine it's gonna be like four per target or something like that with the amount of pre-orders they're gonna be getting yeah I don't know yeah

731
01:00:05,526 --> 01:00:09,668
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on for another development about the Switch 2.

732
01:00:10,448 --> 01:00:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

733
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:26,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so, I mean, I don't know if this is much of a surprise, considering what, you know, Xbox has already been doing with the Switch, importing games over, but Phil Spencer says that Xbox will bring games to the Switch 2 as well.

734
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:28,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, kind of, duh.

735
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:28,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

736
01:00:29,423 --> 01:00:33,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice to have it confirmed, right?

737
01:00:33,444 --> 01:00:58,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been supporting Switch 1 I want to support Switch 2 Nintendo has been a great partner and I think it's a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players who aren't players on Xbox It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about franchises that we have and it's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games Yeah, I mean

738
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly thought that we could count on this stuff to be on there.

739
01:01:04,271 --> 01:01:11,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would be surprised if we haven't already seen some games that they've announced for the Switch 2 already.

740
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

741
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:17,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be surprised if they didn't.

742
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

743
01:01:22,005 --> 01:01:22,925
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to support Switch 2.

744
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:24,326
[SPEAKER_09]: To hell with them.

745
01:01:24,506 --> 01:01:25,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We're EA.

746
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:29,727
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100Matt says Diablo is technically an Xbox game that's on Switch 2.

747
01:01:29,967 --> 01:01:31,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they confirm Diablo 4 yet for Switch 2?

748
01:01:32,248 --> 01:01:36,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was in one of their little trailer things.

749
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:40,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard for me to make heads and tails of it, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if they confirmed that.

750
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:41,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It would make a lot of sense.

751
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not, right?

752
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's see.

753
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:44,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

754
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:57,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say that Microsoft has also shown up recently in Battle.net a little more because, you know, they have Activision Blizzard and Battle.net kind of goes back to the Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo types of days.

755
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:01,102
[SPEAKER_06]: They're adding Sea of Thieves to it, which is kind of interesting.

756
01:02:01,582 --> 01:02:14,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And you also can work your game pass through Battle.net now because you actually play like classic Diablo, Diablo three and you play a lot of that through Battle.net as opposed to the Xbox client, which is kind of interesting.

757
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:15,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

758
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:16,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

759
01:02:16,593 --> 01:02:16,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

760
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:34,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything X-Box

761
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:52,630
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

762
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,170
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

763
01:03:41,261 --> 01:03:53,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of games added to the library of supported games, including Disney Epic Mickey, Lego Marvel Super Heroes, lots and lots that you can see on the Xbox website if you want to check that out.

764
01:03:54,361 --> 01:04:17,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not really used this feature a lot uh one thing I have used though is that on my computer I will stream from the Xbox downstairs you can just do like a live play where you just see it like it's on your TV it's streaming through like your home internet instead of out through the cloud or whatever it's just streaming on the home internet and I have played uh some Xbox games that way obviously the delay is kind of eh but um sometimes if I want to like

765
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:26,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlock Achievements in Diablo 4 or something, you can stream a game that way or just play something that for whatever reason is on Xbox but not my PC, which I really can't think of a lot.

766
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:27,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I think most of it is.

767
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:29,723
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

768
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:32,325
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

769
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Whale.

770
01:04:36,252 --> 01:04:41,156
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gaming Awards 2025, they've announced the nominees.

771
01:04:43,118 --> 01:04:47,743
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to be... I can't make words happen today.

772
01:04:48,323 --> 01:04:52,547
[SPEAKER_03]: There are three nominations for Dragon Age The Veil Guard.

773
01:04:54,709 --> 01:05:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: and a few others coming out, but it's being broadcasted on World of Wonders WoW Presents Plus on Tuesday, July 8th, 2025.

774
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:16,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So other nominees include Life is Strange, Double Exposure, Dragon's Dogma 2, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Paper Mario, Fear the Spotlight, Caravan Sandwich.

775
01:05:18,096 --> 01:05:27,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of the Year nominees are Dragon Age The Veil Guard, Dragon's Dogma 2, Fear the Spotlight, Life is Strange, Double Exposure, Paper Mario, and The Last of Us Part 2.

776
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:38,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had nominations for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Sorry We're Closed, Kitsune Tales, a few others.

777
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:42,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's quite a number of... I don't want to tease them all.

778
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,281
[SPEAKER_03]: People should watch it if they want to know more.

779
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that viewer count up.

780
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:48,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

781
01:05:50,216 --> 01:05:50,517
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

782
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:53,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool to see that support still going on.

783
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:54,825
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

784
01:05:55,226 --> 01:05:56,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

785
01:05:56,188 --> 01:05:56,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

786
01:05:58,174 --> 01:06:02,876
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, I mean, not to be left out in the dust by Nintendo.

787
01:06:03,477 --> 01:06:06,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony is here to say, hey, guess what, guys?

788
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,799
[SPEAKER_09]: We can raise prices, too.

789
01:06:08,939 --> 01:06:09,460
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not?

790
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:10,240
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

791
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's doing it.

792
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:16,343
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're going to increase the price of PlayStation Plus in 20 countries.

793
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:21,806
[SPEAKER_09]: This is right after, of course, they raised the price of the PlayStation 5 as well.

794
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:26,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So, essentially... Well, it's only going to get worse if those tariffs stay in place.

795
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:28,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Those PlayStation 5s are going to cost you twice as much during the holiday.

796
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:29,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

797
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:30,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

798
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:35,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, but this is even... These are countries outside of the United States as well.

799
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:38,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So, essentially, the...

800
01:06:39,928 --> 01:06:42,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Three tiers of PlayStation Plus that they have.

801
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:46,553
[SPEAKER_09]: So Essential, which was $95 a year, is now going up to $110.

802
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:49,175
[SPEAKER_09]: The Extra, which is $155 a year, is now $190.

803
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:52,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And Premium, which was $190, is now $225.

804
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:16,468
[SPEAKER_09]: and uh you know the reason for this well I don't know they didn't give one but no I'm assuming it's basically to uh keep putting out more content on there I guess things are getting more expensive or something like that

805
01:07:18,612 --> 01:07:26,714
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, so this is going to happen in 15 Latin American countries, 5 Southeast Asian nations, and South Korean Australia.

806
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, poor Australia.

807
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:32,796
[SPEAKER_09]: They get just jacked when it comes to pricing all the time.

808
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:35,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that sucks.

809
01:07:37,797 --> 01:07:38,477
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can roll it.

810
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:43,579
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, the only console not getting a hike, the Intellivision Amigo.

811
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:46,159
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

812
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:11,839
[SPEAKER_06]: but you don't really hear often about how there's a lot of BS that's on PlayStation 5 as well.

813
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:19,505
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, three companies, developers were delisted from the PlayStation store in this past week.

814
01:08:19,906 --> 01:08:23,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Adventure Games, Gaming Dev and Grizzly Games.

815
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there are things like there's a lot of shovelware and things that will try to name themselves similar to popular games like there's a flight simulator VR.

816
01:08:33,816 --> 01:08:35,998
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll just steal the code in publishing

817
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:46,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was one of the ones that was delisted this week is I think one of these companies was making a game that was Repo Ghost Hall.

818
01:08:46,766 --> 01:08:52,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But we all know that's a big popular game right now is that REPO, you know, that Repo is big on Twitch right now and stuff.

819
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:54,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So they had their own version of it.

820
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:57,433
[SPEAKER_06]: This one of these companies and that's been taken down.

821
01:08:57,514 --> 01:08:59,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, they just have it's a bunch of garbage.

822
01:09:00,296 --> 01:09:00,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

823
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:17,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there's a bunch of like XXX language quiz games that are out there as well which sound like they were probably generated by AI because I was reading a Reddit post about it and somebody was saying that I checked out the one in my native language and it was full of errors.

824
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably because those games were generated by AI.

825
01:09:21,081 --> 01:09:22,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say what it is.

826
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:36,767
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like Sony maybe does not have the people power to be reviewing all of these in a timely manner, and something's going to have to give on this front because a lot of that crap starts to look bad on them.

827
01:09:37,308 --> 01:09:40,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this has been an issue for a long time.

828
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:41,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I know...

829
01:09:43,030 --> 01:10:06,726
[SPEAKER_09]: was it uh Stephanie Sterling kept pointing out I think it's Guilford B. Pontus or something like that that puts out like these games that are kind of like souls like games but they're like barely functional and he's been doing that for god I think he's published several games for like the last like 10 years or whatever and they've all been just shovelware garbage so I'm sure there's plenty of

830
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:12,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than these three, plenty of studios putting out that content.

831
01:10:13,983 --> 01:10:17,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby in chat says a lot of the shovelware is platinum trophy farms.

832
01:10:17,305 --> 01:10:19,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Play for 10 minutes and get an easy platinum.

833
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:19,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

834
01:10:20,589 --> 01:10:21,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And why would you do that?

835
01:10:21,629 --> 01:10:24,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to make your score go up?

836
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:36,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people get really weird about the size of their E-Penis on their Platinum Trophy, but also technically you get an elevated PlayStation Plus level by earning trophies.

837
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,253
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's really nothing you get out of that.

838
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:42,894
[SPEAKER_06]: They say it's priority access of voice chat.

839
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:43,854
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck does that mean?

840
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:45,214
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck does that mean?

841
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:46,194
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean anything.

842
01:10:46,214 --> 01:10:47,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's E-Penis, like you said.

843
01:10:47,175 --> 01:10:48,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's E-Penis, exactly.

844
01:10:48,735 --> 01:10:51,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we're, and so, yeah, and Rin Marichat says, achievement culture, da-da-da.

845
01:10:52,418 --> 01:11:07,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say all that, but still kind of sort of wish that Nintendo would implement some sort of system on their platform, because I do like the whole, like, I loved where we were going last week, on last week's show, talking about this, where maybe instead of just straight up, like, points, trophies, like, it's a sticker book.

846
01:11:08,232 --> 01:11:11,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we had used Pokemon Home, was it Home?

847
01:11:12,015 --> 01:11:12,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

848
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:20,842
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the Pokemon things is an example of like you put stickers and you use the stickers that you get from different collecting achievements to build your profile picture.

849
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really cute, you know, type of thing.

850
01:11:23,324 --> 01:11:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be like a cute thing for Nintendo to implement.

851
01:11:26,026 --> 01:11:27,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, what do I know?

852
01:11:27,187 --> 01:11:29,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, you know, some guy with a podcast.

853
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, as part of this podcast every week, we like to take down, take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.

854
01:11:36,994 --> 01:11:38,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get to it.

855
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:57,033
[SPEAKER_02]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

856
01:11:57,493 --> 01:12:00,055
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

857
01:12:01,195 --> 01:12:04,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight for the classic game?

858
01:12:05,937 --> 01:12:07,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I have picked Wonder Project J.

859
01:12:09,521 --> 01:12:28,426
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a game that's been on my list for me to play I mean, I own a real copy well, we can see what happens but basically, Wonder Project J is a game that came out in 1994 for Super Famicom and it's a life simulation game it was developed by

860
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:37,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Almanic, which is A-L-M-A-N-I-C Corp, and published by Enix for Super Famicom.

861
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:44,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You play of a boy, Gijin, a robot, created by Dr. Geppetto, and his name is Pino.

862
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

863
01:12:45,452 --> 01:12:46,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in Pinocchio.

864
01:12:47,312 --> 01:13:14,122
[SPEAKER_03]: it was directed by Yoneda Takashi and it was made by most of the same people who worked before on Evo Search for Eden and it was a pretty positively received game and one of the best selling Super Famicom games it even spawned a sequel, Wonder Project J2 that came out in 1996 on N64 so you play as this boy named Pino

865
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:38,371
[SPEAKER_03]: who has a lot a lot of animation to make him seem more human to the player and he has a fairy sidekick named Tinker who acts like a point and he's like the the cursor in a point and click game she is um and you have to educate Pino to make him more human you can scold him when he does something wrong and praise him when he does something right kind of virtual pet like

866
01:13:40,217 --> 01:13:41,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You collect different items to the game.

867
01:13:42,039 --> 01:14:00,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are used to train different parts of his character, like strength and kindness, and some are used to adjust his parameters, like giving him pudding will increase his trust, but batteries increase his health, and others are teaching him behaviors, like sowing seeds, fighting with a sword, things like that.

868
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:13,663
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to succeed in various challenges and different confrontations to activate a virtue circuit that finally lets him activate Circuit J. The tasks are all based on different parameters of his character.

869
01:14:14,123 --> 01:14:15,984
[SPEAKER_03]: If he's strong enough, is he lucky enough?

870
01:14:17,044 --> 01:14:22,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And the final circuit will help him foster his relations between humans and other Gijin.

871
01:14:24,278 --> 01:14:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: He has two health bars.

872
01:14:26,221 --> 01:14:28,725
[SPEAKER_03]: One is physical and the other is mental health.

873
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:34,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Physical tasks or getting hurt will reduce physical health.

874
01:14:35,194 --> 01:14:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Reading a book or getting your feelings hurt reduces your mental health and some might do both.

875
01:14:41,263 --> 01:15:03,958
[SPEAKER_03]: so you have to help him restore both types of health by you know you can spend money you pass let the day pass um you know giving him different tasks that increase those things so um the game was a uh

876
01:15:06,013 --> 01:15:06,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

877
01:15:26,614 --> 01:15:31,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Really was wanting just to do something different.

878
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:33,202
[SPEAKER_03]: The game was never published outside of Japan.

879
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:36,586
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a fan translation.

880
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:41,232
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1995, Hamitsu's reader crush review gave the game a 7 out of 10.

881
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:41,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It sold...

882
01:15:45,337 --> 01:16:00,978
[SPEAKER_03]: 1.3 million units in Japan Hardcore Gamer said that it was a very positive game and in 2011 1up.com's Bob Mackey said it was one of the six must-play Super Nintendo imports

883
01:16:02,213 --> 01:16:11,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was that sequel, Wonder Project J2, which was developed by Givro Corp, which was previously Omnic, and released by Enix for N64.

884
01:16:12,203 --> 01:16:16,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the last projects that Givro did before their company dissolved in 1998.

885
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: It was re-released by Squenix as a two-part download for mobile phones in Japan in 2010.

886
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:25,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is it.

887
01:16:25,675 --> 01:16:26,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonder Project J.

888
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:33,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We have not done all of the MX games, I can tell you that right now Yeah, I've done a few, but certainly not all

889
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:53,725
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

890
01:16:54,346 --> 01:16:55,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's oops, not that one.

891
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:57,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I was running the wrong thing there for a minute.

892
01:16:57,831 --> 01:17:05,444
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's get back into the show and some more gaming news in a segment that we call Rapid Fire News.

893
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other quick headlines from the night.

894
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:07,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

895
01:17:09,509 --> 01:17:25,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Bethesda, you know, the company that's piecemealing everything when it comes to Elder Scrolls now is allowing you for the 10 year anniversary of Elder Scrolls Online to own some of its RAM from its server it doesn't need anymore.

896
01:17:26,463 --> 01:17:37,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can pay $110 to pre-order it and they're having 2,000 sticks of RAM that are going to be included in this

897
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:44,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Anniversary gold-plated plaque thing that you can have.

898
01:17:45,434 --> 01:17:50,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like, to me, a way that they could just upgrade the RAM without having to actually pay for it.

899
01:17:50,537 --> 01:17:53,439
[SPEAKER_03]: They did that with World of Warcraft, though, didn't they?

900
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:54,079
[SPEAKER_09]: They sure did.

901
01:17:54,119 --> 01:17:55,200
[SPEAKER_09]: At some point, they did, yeah.

902
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

903
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the original Warcraft games, they were selling RAM sets.

904
01:18:01,224 --> 01:18:08,308
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's something that you're interested, you better get on it now because there's only 2,000 and they're going to be delivering those in July.

905
01:18:09,821 --> 01:18:11,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah.

906
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, quickly, TigerClaw in chat says, hopefully it's RAM that's compatible.

907
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,503
[SPEAKER_06]: If you need more RAM in your PC, I don't think it's that cut.

908
01:18:19,523 --> 01:18:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not server RAM.

909
01:18:20,204 --> 01:18:21,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It's server RAM, which is going to be different.

910
01:18:21,785 --> 01:18:22,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably old.

911
01:18:23,305 --> 01:18:25,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think it would help your computer that much.

912
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:29,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So unless you're going to, if you want to start your own bootleg server, maybe.

913
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:34,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really think this is just some, I remember when they sold those Warcraft servers that DarkSakura was talking about.

914
01:18:34,452 --> 01:18:36,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the classic WoW servers.

915
01:18:36,533 --> 01:18:38,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched someone buy one of those.

916
01:18:38,695 --> 01:18:40,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they went for thousands of dollars.

917
01:18:41,243 --> 01:18:41,983
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme

918
01:19:04,717 --> 01:19:16,280
[SPEAKER_09]: For Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, they just revealed a brand new patch that adds a few things, including offline versus for all games, as well as a few other options.

919
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:20,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the things added in there, X-Men vs. Street Fighter gets a version selection.

920
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:22,702
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually pick which version of the game you want to play.

921
01:19:23,442 --> 01:19:31,124
[SPEAKER_09]: There's different resolution options for Marvel vs. Capcom 2, as well as menu button settings allows you to

922
01:19:35,104 --> 01:20:01,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Open those with a long press to avoid accidental inputs They also have new artwork that's available to view that And bonus tracks with remixes of classic songs by Capjams from the Capcom sound team So they have a theme from Captain America, theme of Cyclops, theme of Jim, and theme of Captain Commando that are remixed I kind of want to listen to that

923
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:21,913
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah, that's awesome and free if you have the game nice alright, DarkSakura so a couple of things actually both pinball related is that Barrels of Fun officially revealed their second pinball table, Dune they have a license for Dune

924
01:20:23,537 --> 01:20:46,950
[SPEAKER_03]: um they are going to sell 300 of the thousand limited uh directly to the public the rest is going through distributors um but yeah very very limited release of this they all have a uh two thousand dollar deposit they're going to be eleven thousand six hundred dollars um and then as far as the other pinball release Stern is doing uh King Kong

925
01:20:48,722 --> 01:21:15,477
[SPEAKER_03]: and looks like they are doing pro premium and 932 limited edition models with the lowest starting at $6,999 pinball is not a cheap hobby to get into fuck no it's not even if you start with old tables they're still going to set you back quite a bit so alright that is true

926
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:21,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things you can get that are going to be a little cheaper than pinball.

927
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with the US and Loki.

1000
01:28:00,702 --> 01:28:02,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun, whatever it is you're going to be gaming with this week.

1001

1002
01:28:10,445 --> 01:28:16,787
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have anything in chat, we can also take a quick phone call over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to join our green room.

[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, if any questions are in chat, we also open up our mailbag every week.

1004
01:28:22,148 --> 01:28:25,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at orangelaunchradio.com, but I'm guessing it's nothing but spam.

1005
01:28:28,484 --> 01:28:29,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

1006
01:28:30,045 --> 01:28:45,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I was laughing because earlier during the show, you might have caught me, those of you that are watching live on Twitch, might have caught me looking at my phone and giggling, and that's because Jamie was texting me with a screenshot of her me that she made in Pikmin Bloom.

1007
01:28:45,369 --> 01:28:45,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Just there it is.

1008
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:51,731
[SPEAKER_06]: There's DarkSakura in Pikmin Bloom with her first two Pikmin.

1009
01:28:51,751 --> 01:28:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1010
01:28:52,531 --> 01:28:53,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting you on blast.

1011
01:28:56,169 --> 01:28:57,571
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did I resist, though?

1012
01:28:57,651 --> 01:28:58,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

1013
01:28:58,692 --> 01:28:59,333
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's funny.

1014
01:28:59,413 --> 01:28:59,954
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny to me.

1015
01:28:59,994 --> 01:29:02,457
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured it's worth checking out.

1016
01:29:02,898 --> 01:29:04,199
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free, right?

1017
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:05,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, whatever.

1018
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,486
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only farming your location data to be able to sell to third parties.

1019
01:29:09,526 --> 01:29:09,926
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

1020
01:29:09,986 --> 01:29:10,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a big deal.

1021
01:29:11,148 --> 01:29:12,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Until you opt out of it.

1022
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:12,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1023
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:15,368
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

1024
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:59,314
[SPEAKER_06]: turn it off when you stop and then you can catch up on mushrooms and the other you haven't gotten there yet Jamie but as you get to level 5 and level 10 you unlock a couple other mechanisms in the game and you can kind of like do those before you go to bed or just like as your phone nags you during the day or something this is very you know you have to have it open like I can't run like no no no they have it has adventure sync which they had in Pokemon Go and all the other stuff runs in the background just runs in the background so that's fucking ridiculous yeah

1025
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1026
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:03,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I said uninstalling right now.

1027
01:30:03,922 --> 01:30:04,123
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1028
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:04,544
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1029
01:30:04,624 --> 01:30:04,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1030
01:30:05,891 --> 01:30:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1031
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:38,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will also stop you from tracing a line directly to your house by setting a privacy zone.

1032
01:30:38,277 --> 01:30:39,177
[SPEAKER_06]: So just a tip for everybody.

1033
01:30:39,197 --> 01:30:40,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, can other people see my lines?

1034
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:40,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they can.

1035
01:30:41,638 --> 01:30:42,599
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see their lines.

1036
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:45,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you set a privacy zone, you won't be able to see lines.

1037
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:48,742
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't be able to see lines around your house.

1038
01:30:49,722 --> 01:30:54,384
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see ones that other people did, but you will not leave trails going past your house.

1039
01:30:54,885 --> 01:30:55,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1040
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:59,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

1041
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:05,063
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says, I don't think you guys mentioned this, but there's been some announcements at Star Wars Celebration Japan.

1042
01:31:05,443 --> 01:31:09,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right, we didn't talk about this, but let me run over what TigerClaw says.

1043
01:31:10,786 --> 01:31:13,287
[SPEAKER_06]: New Star Wars content during the month of May for Fortnite.

1044
01:31:14,087 --> 01:31:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: and a new Star Wars game got announced for Star Wars Zero Company is what it's called, which is basically Star Wars XCOM.

1045
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was seeing that stuff because Fortnite has the Darth Jar Jar in it.

1046
01:31:24,652 --> 01:31:28,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw you guys talking about that on Discord and I thought that was really interesting.

1047
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:31,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, they're really trying to make Jar Jar cool now, aren't they?

1048
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:32,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have.

1049
01:31:32,876 --> 01:31:34,677
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to erase the memory of 20 years ago.

1050
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:39,920
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in the new Lego Star Wars movie that's coming out on Disney Plus or Series X.

1051
01:31:40,400 --> 01:32:07,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a series it's too much the Star Wars world is like twisted so you have a lot of these flip-flop characters and Darth Jar Jar is in that as well yep so yeah that's going to be interesting with that Fortnite collaboration and yeah it's going to I mean I feel like is it really going to bring more eyes to Fortnite already Fortnite is super fucking popular like it's just going to be more skins that people are going to buy in Fortnite so yeah um

1052
01:32:07,449 --> 01:32:08,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1053
01:32:28,532 --> 01:32:33,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a series of what they call preparatory briefs, and they were filed in February.

1054
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:43,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And Pocket Pair in these briefs are saying that Nintendo's patents and suits should not have been granted because other work has already used them in the past.

1055
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:51,421
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, there's one patent that Nintendo got that is about capturing characters by releasing monsters or capture balls.

1056
01:32:51,781 --> 01:32:56,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But Craftopia, Pocket Pair argues, did the same thing.

1057
01:32:56,063 --> 01:32:56,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1058
01:32:57,043 --> 01:33:02,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And then let's see, also Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2, Pikmin 3 Deluxe.

1059
01:33:02,807 --> 01:33:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They say they all allow players to release a monster or a capture item and fire in a direction by releasing a button.

1060
01:33:10,513 --> 01:33:19,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're basically saying Nintendo should have never been granted these patents in the first place, which is, I mean, yeah, I actually kind of agree that like this is... I do agree.

1061
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,362
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the place to be fighting this.

1062
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:37,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't understand why the fight from Nintendo is not about the actual design of the trademarked Pokemon, but I'm not Nintendo and I'm also no legal expert and perhaps do not understand why they feel they would not win that case.

1063
01:33:37,677 --> 01:33:38,378
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever it is.

1064
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:40,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very interesting.

1065
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:41,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1066
01:33:41,781 --> 01:33:47,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Jay Helensky in chat says, funny how they never held these patents until another game existed that infringed on them.

1067
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:48,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's also weird too.

1068
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:49,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right?

1069
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:52,810
[SPEAKER_09]: That you can patent something after the fact and be like, oh, they were suing you.

1070
01:33:52,830 --> 01:33:58,755
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like... That it wasn't a problem until... And again, I think the real problem is that the Pokemon...

1071
01:34:00,997 --> 01:34:07,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The legally distinct Pokemon in the game are not legally distinct enough is really the problem.

1072
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:09,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't understand why that's not the lawsuit.

1073
01:34:09,879 --> 01:34:11,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I'm not a legal expert.

1074
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:20,162
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you don't sue for that, then you kind of... That's the argument that you're making, so it's not a good one.

1075
01:34:20,902 --> 01:34:26,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wonder, so they're basically going to try, it sounds to me, and get these patents disqualified, thrown out.

1076
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Because isn't that what happened?

1077
01:34:27,606 --> 01:34:30,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, didn't somebody try to fucking patent podcasting?

1078
01:34:32,129 --> 01:34:33,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was way after the fact.

1079
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:39,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, obviously all the big name podcasters at the time were coming out swinging against this.

1080
01:34:39,133 --> 01:34:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically their patent got shredded.

1081
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:43,996
[SPEAKER_06]: That it should never have been granted in the first place.

1082
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, interesting.

1083
01:34:46,817 --> 01:34:47,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1084
01:34:48,308 --> 01:35:07,370
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think, I don't know I don't remember that one particularly but like something to the effect of like where I'll put it in perspective we're doing it to protect it so no one else does it the big name podcaster they started going after at the time was Adam Carolla

1085
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:10,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to that guy?

1086
01:35:10,802 --> 01:35:15,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Love Lines and the show they ended up with on MTV.

1087
01:35:15,764 --> 01:35:18,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he kind of – well, he started a morning show or something.

1088
01:35:18,365 --> 01:35:23,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's more on the conservative end of things now, which is really interesting when you look at where Jimmy Kimmel's ended up.

1089
01:35:23,947 --> 01:35:24,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of –

1090
01:35:25,868 --> 01:35:27,489
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's why they split, too.

1091
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:30,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, probably, probably.

1092
01:35:30,673 --> 01:35:31,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

1093
01:35:32,855 --> 01:35:39,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but Jimmy Kimmel also used to do that show with Ben Stein, who's also, a lot of people don't realize, Ben Stein's also pretty notorious.

1094
01:35:40,043 --> 01:35:41,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Win Ben Stein's money, heck yeah!

1095
01:35:41,965 --> 01:35:43,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Jimmy Kimmel was on that show, too.

1096
01:35:44,808 --> 01:35:48,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So, like, if I could go on... Well, we're going to go on a tangent anyways.

1097
01:35:48,092 --> 01:35:48,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1098
01:35:48,513 --> 01:35:49,634
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that part of the show.

1099
01:35:49,734 --> 01:35:50,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.

1100
01:35:50,215 --> 01:35:56,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's so... There was a thing that I got introduced to this week.

1101
01:35:57,064 --> 01:35:57,645
[SPEAKER_09]: It was...

1102
01:35:59,724 --> 01:36:11,770
[SPEAKER_09]: by another fellow content creator by the name of Pixel Riffs, who introduced me to this relatively new show called Kaso.

1103
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:20,014
[SPEAKER_09]: And Kaso is a Japanese skateboarding TV show in the vein of Ninja Warrior.

1104
01:36:20,894 --> 01:36:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting Okay Interesting

1105
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:50,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, before we wrap it up for tonight, Loki, any last-minute stories to share with us tonight?

1106
01:36:51,379 --> 01:36:51,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I looked.

1107
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I could not find any.

1108
01:36:54,701 --> 01:36:55,482
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1109
01:36:55,522 --> 01:36:57,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly Asakotaku.

1110
01:36:57,243 --> 01:36:57,843
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about it.

1111
01:36:57,983 --> 01:36:58,584
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I saw.

1112
01:36:59,024 --> 01:36:59,464
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?

1113
01:37:00,438 --> 01:37:21,988
[SPEAKER_06]: possible layoffs at Kotaku again who's left over there well actually they don't even like you go to their site an old article no this is an old article so okay well I mean few that it's not new but also like there's been definitely a change in strategical direction over there because you go to the launch page it's not gaming news it's not 100 gaming news no it's another and that's the same with

1114
01:37:22,068 --> 01:37:22,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1115
01:37:22,348 --> 01:37:22,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1116
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:22,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1117
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:46,852
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not here to report the news.

1118
01:37:46,892 --> 01:37:48,032
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here to comment on the news.

1119
01:37:48,072 --> 01:37:50,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a big difference between that.

1120
01:37:50,213 --> 01:37:52,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's one thing you can sort of never replace.

1121
01:37:52,734 --> 01:37:56,115
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also we are also under no illusion that we're profiting off of this.

1122
01:37:56,515 --> 01:38:00,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have been generous enough with the biddies and the subs that we can afford to keep this running.

1123
01:38:00,257 --> 01:38:02,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're not paying out of our own pocket to do this.

1124
01:38:02,638 --> 01:38:07,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that's that's really cool because there was a period of time when we were on shoutcast and all that we were paying out of pocket to do that.

1125
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's that's fine you know people pay for hobbies that they enjoy but Twitch has allowed us to monetize enough so that we can actually be we have all the legal types of protections and that sort of thing that that we need to keep us legitimate and all that so it's nice that we're not like paying out of pocket to do any of that and once in a while we get to sponsor a nice thing like I'm hoping we get to sponsor a nice little gaming conference coming up in like two months so we'll hopefully have more news on that in the coming weeks.

1126
01:38:37,534 --> 01:38:38,816
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can all probably guess what it is.

1127
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's in Bobby's neck of the woods.

1128
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:43,565
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be the biggest tune you need.

1129
01:38:45,028 --> 01:38:45,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1130
01:38:46,491 --> 01:38:48,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot where I was going with that, but sure.

1131
01:38:49,361 --> 01:38:50,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying words.

1132
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:53,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, something about commentating versus news and all that.

1133
01:38:53,323 --> 01:38:54,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the guides and all that stuff.

1134
01:38:55,004 --> 01:39:03,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, with social media, how many of you are getting your updates from, let's say, Kotaku, but I'm using that to symbolize a lot of gaming websites.

1135
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:17,476
[SPEAKER_06]: versus Wario 64 at this point and other those social media people that kind of keep it down to, you know, 300 characters.

1136
01:39:17,496 --> 01:39:18,576
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the blue sky limit?

1137
01:39:18,756 --> 01:39:19,137
[SPEAKER_06]: 300 characters?

1138
01:39:19,437 --> 01:39:21,758
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that take 300 characters or less.

1139
01:39:22,745 --> 01:39:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's mainly those because I find sites like Kotaku and stuff like that, you'll get an article that's a summary of a social media post or a summary of a YouTube video that's been put up.

1140
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:42,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's so much garbage around it with the ads and the videos and the autoplays and the punchline is at the end and all that.

1141
01:39:42,792 --> 01:39:44,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny enough, I missed the

1142
01:39:45,353 --> 01:39:52,419
[SPEAKER_09]: The comments on the articles as well, because that was something at least you could see some pushback on things.

1143
01:39:52,459 --> 01:39:58,143
[SPEAKER_09]: You would see like corrections on there about certain things or like people sharing their opinions and stuff.

1144
01:39:58,183 --> 01:40:00,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And now there isn't that on there in any ways.

1145
01:40:00,345 --> 01:40:05,869
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I get a lot of my news, especially when it comes to gaming stuff from social media, because that's where...

1146
01:40:06,269 --> 01:40:06,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaks first.

1147
01:40:35,836 --> 01:40:37,237
[SPEAKER_06]: and it keeps us humble.

1148
01:40:37,357 --> 01:40:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

1149
01:40:37,717 --> 01:40:48,603
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know everything, but we're here to talk about it and have fun with it and be chatty at the dinner table after a round of gaming, playing DDR at the arcade for an hour.

1150
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:50,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1151
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:52,306
[SPEAKER_06]: PodCulture says, I get most of my news here on Sundays.

1152
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:53,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do appreciate that.

1153
01:40:53,186 --> 01:40:56,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize there are people that maybe don't follow all that social media stuff.

1154
01:40:56,808 --> 01:41:00,050
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need to inject gaming news into their veins every single day.

1155
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:01,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So they kind of get

1156
01:41:02,011 --> 01:41:02,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1157
01:41:22,888 --> 01:41:26,670
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a few Nintendo blogs on Blue Sky that I follow, mostly Nintendo stuff, sure.

1158
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:29,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And TigerClaw echoes the gaming sites on social media.

1159
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:30,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.

1160
01:41:33,433 --> 01:41:33,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1161
01:41:34,473 --> 01:41:39,375
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100Matt says, turns out you can't profit off of making terrible headlines and rage bait stories.

1162
01:41:39,496 --> 01:41:41,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, what was the article I saw?

1163
01:41:41,496 --> 01:41:48,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It had nothing to do with gaming, but I literally screamed at how bad this headline was.

1164
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:49,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, I want to see if I can find it.

1165
01:41:51,254 --> 01:41:52,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see if I can find it.

1166
01:41:52,114 --> 01:42:02,696
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite, though, is some of these sites that do have all these guides and things, and when you go to the next page, it jumps four weeks in the past, and there's no way to see anything that's fallen off of that first page.

1167
01:42:02,757 --> 01:42:03,797
[SPEAKER_09]: That's another fun one.

1168
01:42:03,937 --> 01:42:04,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here we go.

1169
01:42:04,697 --> 01:42:04,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1170
01:42:04,977 --> 01:42:07,277
[SPEAKER_06]: This has nothing to do with gaming, I'm going to admit.

1171
01:42:07,678 --> 01:42:10,638
[SPEAKER_06]: But tell me you don't see this same shit in the gaming sphere, okay?

1172
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:13,859
[SPEAKER_06]: This one hit my Google News feed.

1173
01:42:13,939 --> 01:42:14,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the headline.

1174
01:42:14,759 --> 01:42:15,059
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

1175
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,880
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a headline from People magazine that says...

1176
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:32,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen Yang says you know the actor right from Saturday Night Live Bowen Yang says he will leave Saturday Night Live at some point exclusive at some point exclusive

1177
01:42:34,498 --> 01:42:37,621
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit.

1178
01:42:37,661 --> 01:42:38,241
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit.

1179
01:42:38,581 --> 01:42:40,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you fucking shitting me?

1180
01:42:40,963 --> 01:42:50,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody who has a finite amount of time on this earth may leave a television program no matter how long that program's been running at some point?

1181
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1182
01:42:52,953 --> 01:42:53,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you shitting me?

1183
01:42:53,954 --> 01:42:54,014
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

1184
01:43:01,505 --> 01:43:15,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, that's that's can you imagine like being a person working on a publication and bringing that to your editor and saying, here, I made a thing.

1185
01:43:15,274 --> 01:43:17,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And your editor looks at that and goes, yep, let's print it.

1186
01:43:18,036 --> 01:43:22,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I mean, like, can you imagine like it's like, what is this conveying?

1187
01:43:23,099 --> 01:43:24,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that they may leave at some point.

1188
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:25,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but that's everybody, right?

1189
01:43:25,941 --> 01:43:26,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusive.

1190
01:43:26,241 --> 01:43:26,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusive.

1191
01:43:56,153 --> 01:43:57,414
[SPEAKER_05]: What a fucking joke!

1192
01:44:01,217 --> 01:44:01,558
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1193
01:44:02,198 --> 01:44:04,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, everybody, OLR exclusive.

1194
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the OLR exclusive for you.

1195
01:44:06,922 --> 01:44:11,466
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 6 will release at some point.

1196
01:44:11,566 --> 01:44:12,366
[SPEAKER_06]: At some point.

1197
01:44:12,787 --> 01:44:14,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusive.

1198
01:44:14,508 --> 01:44:15,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your exclusive.

1199
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go to bed.

1200
01:44:18,551 --> 01:44:19,112
[SPEAKER_06]: When you want.

1201
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:21,781
[SPEAKER_03]: in the future.

1202
01:44:22,221 --> 01:44:22,942
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an exclusive.

1203
01:44:23,482 --> 01:44:25,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusive OLR headline.

1204
01:44:25,144 --> 01:44:26,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be sleeping at some point.

1205
01:44:27,165 --> 01:44:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Exclusive OLR headline.

1206
01:44:29,808 --> 01:44:30,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I deserve a sweet treat.

1207
01:44:31,569 --> 01:44:31,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1208
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:39,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1209
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:39,641
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1210
01:44:41,462 --> 01:44:45,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Jay Helensky says space news will throw up at some point.

1211
01:44:45,765 --> 01:44:49,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Space news has a huge habit of these kind of news stories as well.

1212
01:44:49,647 --> 01:44:55,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look, look what took up all the fucking air in the room in space news this week.

1213
01:44:56,512 --> 01:45:03,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had to do with a certain singer and a certain talk show host best friend going up into space for 11 minutes.

1214
01:45:04,861 --> 01:45:05,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they're astronauts.

1215
01:45:06,281 --> 01:45:08,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're astronauts.

1216
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:12,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys did all that training.

1217
01:45:12,903 --> 01:45:16,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all I did was just buy a ticket and I went like, it can't be that hard.

1218
01:45:16,804 --> 01:45:20,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, by the way, the shade, the shade that was going around with that.

1219
01:45:20,825 --> 01:45:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know that there was like, like Pop Crave or one of those things.

1220
01:45:24,886 --> 01:45:26,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Rin Mari says Space Lounge Radio.

1221
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:29,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking, I fucking love space.

1222
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:30,627
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually like a nerdy...

1223
01:45:31,547 --> 01:45:40,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I get all my news from the gas station, the pump TV that they have on there.

1224
01:45:40,991 --> 01:45:46,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Pop Crave put this post up about Katy Perry went to space, you know, type of thing.

1225
01:45:46,954 --> 01:45:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wendy's, the brand, the burger chain, replied, can we send her back?

1226
01:45:53,077 --> 01:45:58,899
[SPEAKER_06]: To which, by the way, within three hours, Kesha the singer said,

1227
01:45:59,073 --> 01:45:59,774
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

1228
01:46:21,692 --> 01:46:28,555
[SPEAKER_06]: who she worked with and who Kesha once upon a time worked with and things got very, very, very ugly.

1229
01:46:28,935 --> 01:46:34,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why that is some A-plus classmaster shade for Kesha to be drinking about a Wendy's cup.

1230
01:46:34,598 --> 01:46:39,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently the whole thing hurt Katy Perry's feelings.

1231
01:46:41,421 --> 01:46:41,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no.

1232
01:46:43,321 --> 01:46:44,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel so bad.

1233
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,368
[SPEAKER_06]: and Wendy's.

1234
01:46:46,388 --> 01:46:49,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Tiger Class says they got a ton of backlash over it but didn't apologize.

1235
01:46:49,309 --> 01:46:56,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Wendy's said, well, we get spicy on Twitter sometimes just like our chicken nuggets which are available for $4.99.

1236
01:46:56,352 --> 01:46:57,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

1237
01:46:57,392 --> 01:47:01,894
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't say that last half but you know an intern drafted it.

1238
01:47:02,234 --> 01:47:03,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You know somebody drafted it.

1239
01:47:03,455 --> 01:47:11,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we should stop saying social media interns because there's people that make a lot of money on social media and at Wendy's you know somebody's getting paid over there for this shit.

1240
01:47:12,178 --> 01:47:14,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all that free advertising for Wendy's that Kesha just did.

1241
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:15,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1242
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:17,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

1243
01:47:18,702 --> 01:47:24,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby says, I didn't realize Wendy's was still a spicy social media brand because all the smart people got off Twitter.

1244
01:47:25,088 --> 01:47:30,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to get all this news stuff secondhand because a lot of the brands, trademark, are still on Twitter.

1245
01:47:31,214 --> 01:47:36,458
[SPEAKER_06]: But if rumor is to be believed on some code sourcing that was done on GitHub...

1246
01:47:37,079 --> 01:47:40,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue Sky is about to roll out their version of verified accounts.

1247
01:47:41,281 --> 01:47:42,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, you don't pay for it.

1248
01:47:42,682 --> 01:47:43,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different mechanism.

1249
01:47:44,403 --> 01:47:49,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week, supposedly, based on things that are seen in the code, you know, again, take that with a huge grain of salt.

1250
01:47:49,985 --> 01:47:54,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to know when Blue Sky is rolling out pictures in the DMs and private accounts.

1251
01:47:55,668 --> 01:47:59,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realize that takes time because it is all built on the backbone of the app protocol.

1252
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:02,311
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, time's a-tickin'.

1253
01:48:02,471 --> 01:48:03,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Time's a-tickin'.

1254
01:48:04,009 --> 01:48:05,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so glad I fucking left that site.

1255
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:10,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not deleting my account because I don't want anyone to, you know...

1256
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:25,974
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and I didn't either.

1257
01:48:26,575 --> 01:48:29,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe me, I hate that website more than anybody else, but I don't want anyone taking my account.

1258
01:48:29,819 --> 01:48:34,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have business cards in circulation that have it, but I just have a big message that says, she gone, girl.

1259
01:48:35,305 --> 01:48:38,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a link to my new socials and all that stuff.

1260
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:41,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But I took the app off my phone

1261
01:48:41,812 --> 01:48:42,632
[SPEAKER_06]: J. Helensky

1262
01:49:02,342 --> 01:49:09,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be an opt-in thing, just saying, because I don't want nasty pictures sent to me.

1263
01:49:10,691 --> 01:49:11,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it is.

1264
01:49:12,193 --> 01:49:15,076
[SPEAKER_06]: DMs in general are an opt-in thing.

1265
01:49:15,116 --> 01:49:15,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You can turn it off.

1266
01:49:16,138 --> 01:49:18,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I think right now you can have it be set to private.

1267
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:19,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep my DMs.

1268
01:49:20,002 --> 01:49:23,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be able to opt-in whether or not someone can send me a fucking picture.

1269
01:49:24,286 --> 01:49:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see when they actually roll it out.

1270
01:49:25,927 --> 01:49:31,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have been pretty good about actually opt-in because, again, a billionaire doesn't own Blue Sky right now.

1271
01:49:31,069 --> 01:49:33,450
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no shareholder involvement in Blue Sky right now.

1272
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:36,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So a world without Caesars, all of that.

1273
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:37,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1274
01:49:37,852 --> 01:49:39,292
[SPEAKER_06]: But y'all had some other good comments.

1275
01:49:39,432 --> 01:49:41,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, where was the part about – here it is.

1276
01:49:42,193 --> 01:49:47,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwolf talking about the brands on Blue Sky saying, well, the brands got bullied off of Blue Sky by Adobe.

1277
01:49:48,496 --> 01:49:59,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was... Adobe made some bleat and everybody just dogpiled on him about subscription fees and AI and the forced opt-in and all that stuff.

1278
01:49:59,539 --> 01:50:01,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Every grievance people had with Adobe came out.

1279
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, very interesting.

1280
01:50:06,121 --> 01:50:11,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe don't be shitty and people won't treat you that way.

1281
01:50:11,543 --> 01:50:12,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so...

1282
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:15,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's see.

1283
01:50:16,052 --> 01:50:18,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was pretty ugly.

1284
01:50:18,974 --> 01:50:20,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's it.

1285
01:50:20,635 --> 01:50:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had enough off-topic chatter.

1286
01:50:22,756 --> 01:50:23,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's wrap things up for the night.

1287
01:50:24,557 --> 01:50:26,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1288
01:50:26,318 --> 01:50:30,081
[SPEAKER_06]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.

1289
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:35,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend or two about our show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1290
01:50:35,544 --> 01:50:37,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell a friend or two about the show.

1291
01:50:37,545 --> 01:50:42,749
[SPEAKER_06]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show.

1292
01:50:43,209 --> 01:50:46,450
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that goes an awful long way, and we really appreciate it.

1293
01:50:47,311 --> 01:50:52,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That all being said, DarkSakura, I think you said you're doing some streaming tonight, so we'll let you go.

1294
01:50:52,552 --> 01:50:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Any last thoughts on your way out?

1295
01:50:55,994 --> 01:50:57,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Lord, I'm in for it.

1296
01:50:58,214 --> 01:50:58,575
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1297
01:50:59,035 --> 01:50:59,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in for it.

1298
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:04,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I hurt, too, so we'll see how long this goes.

1299
01:51:04,777 --> 01:51:06,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I will feel better.

1300
01:51:08,038 --> 01:51:10,439
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, that takes us over to you and your final thought for tonight.

1301
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:16,422
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is now I'm only a week away from jury duty.

1302
01:51:17,162 --> 01:51:18,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not happy about that.

1303
01:51:18,282 --> 01:51:18,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You poor soul.

1304
01:51:19,343 --> 01:51:21,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's a quick two-day trial.

1305
01:51:22,784 --> 01:51:23,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully.

1306
01:51:25,264 --> 01:51:32,007
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought for tonight is I'm going to see Kylie Minogue on Tuesday in San Francisco, and I'm so excited because I love her.

1307
01:51:33,267 --> 01:51:37,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know she's playing all the DDR bops, but lots of good stuff from her catalog.

1308
01:51:37,768 --> 01:51:39,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually never seen her live.

1309
01:51:40,849 --> 01:51:44,772
[SPEAKER_06]: After all these chances I've had and I've just missed because sometimes I'm a bump on a log.

1310
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So this time I said I'm not going to miss it.

1311
01:51:47,053 --> 01:51:48,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't wait for that.

1312
01:51:48,674 --> 01:51:51,375
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just can't get that out of my head.

1313
01:51:52,335 --> 01:51:54,877
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1314
01:51:54,957 --> 01:51:56,378
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, we'll see you in seven days.

1315
01:51:57,058 --> 01:51:58,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with the Switch pre-order Hunger Games.

1316
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:02,141
[SPEAKER_06]: May the odds ever be in your favor on those Switch 2s.

1317
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:02,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck, everybody.

1318
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:05,082
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see how it went for everybody next week.

1319
01:52:05,222 --> 01:52:06,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, have a good night.

1320
01:52:06,463 --> 01:52:06,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1321
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1322
01:52:13,401 --> 01:52:16,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
