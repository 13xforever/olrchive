39366	41846	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41886	45827	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45947	48988	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
49148	59069	Once again, tonight, April the 20th of 2025, you know, 420, with episode number 1043 of our show.
59830	63190	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week along with my co-hosts.
63350	67031	Say hello first off to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
67111	67311	Hello.
69281	69562	Hi!
70163	71206	A lot of people are today.
71246	72189	It's 420, you know.
73532	76119	Yeah, but the big holiday was really yesterday.
76678	77718	Oh, that's right.
77818	79059	Your birthday.
79499	83460	See, I could see where people might think it was a week ago because you did that subathon.
83540	85421	But no, your actual birthday was yesterday.
85521	86841	So happy Bappy.
88502	90082	Thank you.
90342	100326	There's an infamous cat meme, and it's the only one that I know to send DarkSakura because it is her meme, basically, that says, no, it are my birthday with the cat trying to eat the birthday cake.
100506	102646	So I texted Jamie that yesterday.
103006	104427	Did you do anything special to celebrate?
105592	107534	Well, I went to San Francisco.
108075	109436	Well, Dan and I went out for sushi.
109516	110277	Thank you, everybody.
113620	118525	We went out for sushi, Dan and I did, and then I saw Pride and Prejudice, which I had actually never seen the movie.
118866	122630	I tried to make it through the book, but I really don't care for Jane Austen's writing, I guess.
123030	123851	Mm-hmm.
125913	126654	So we watched it.
126714	127294	It was great.
128475	136102	And then yesterday, my friend Alicia and I, y'all may know her in my chat as Mabel Von Smallcat.
137163	138324	I like that name.
138984	142908	We went to San Francisco and met up with JD.
144088	145589	Oh shit, I haven't seen him in a while.
146069	146710	I miss his face.
146730	150492	We went to Sakura Matsuri and it was just so crowded.
150572	154454	I mean, we got to see the cultural stuff, which is what we wanted to do.
155094	163939	And the one makeup item I wanted wasn't there, so I was annoyed with that, but I got a lot of sheet masks and I picked up a new tea set for matcha.
164499	164860	Oh, fun.
165060	167761	You know, with the whisk and the bowl and the scoop and everything.
169182	171223	And I also...
173224	202026	and got Unagi and then on the way back we were we were just like oh my god I'm tired oh my god I'm tired and I'm hungry I'm hungry so we stopped in Davis to try to find this kaiten sushi place that Dan and I had been to different occasions before the pandemic and we were hoping they were still open and it said the business was still there but when we found the business it looked like it was completely different there was nobody in there and
202887	204769	The place was really neat.
204809	218148	They had really big pieces of their nigiri, and they had a wonderful unagi hand roll, and the roll that Alicia ordered was massive for what she paid for it.
218929	244106	and I mean it was really good and they had those dolls like I like to collect the traditional Japanese dolls with like the beautiful kimono and everything and I talked to the guy there and he's like yeah we used to be the Kaitenzushi place and then they had to close and they reopened as this place so I'm like well I'm glad you guys are still around I miss the Kaitenzushi but I'm glad that you're still here and you're doing well and who
244646	245167	It was nice.
245307	253774	It was kind of fun to just catch up and see that the business that I really liked evolved past the pandemic.
253954	254594	So I was happy.
254934	255195	Nice.
255335	261139	And then came home and then when I got home, I was too keyed up again to really go to sleep.
261259	263521	So I stayed up until I passed out in my chair and then it was good.
264302	264982	Good times.
265263	271968	And then Dan made breakfast this morning, although we had it at lunchtime and I'm like,
274350	276313	I guess it was kind of like an Easter thing.
276373	277795	I don't do Easter.
277915	279657	Easter for us is just food.
281800	288770	It's really Passover and sadly there wasn't a Seder for me to attend this year and I didn't really want to put on one myself.
289645	318654	so um so yeah and I have lots of snacky things that I will no longer be consuming after tomorrow because tomorrow is the end of my birthday weekend because I took two days off of work and um making your weekend a national holiday in other news I did find out about what really was going on with my leg oh so I did hurt my quad but what I actually tore was my hamstring
321463	323185	I went to full on sports medicine.
323225	325749	He ultrasounded my entire right leg.
326590	328854	It was pretty interesting.
329475	336205	And so I start physical therapy on Thursday with a focus on dance therapy.
337219	340804	I was going to say no DDR for you, but in the future, yes.
341585	343347	No, I can actually do DDR.
343608	348995	I mean, the problem is the things that I can't do in ballet are things that require full extension.
350016	353040	Like, for example, there is a...
355083	365190	A move called a developpe, where you're basically bringing your leg up in front of you, 90 degree or higher, you know, or to the side or to the back.
365830	373135	I can only do that motion in attitude where your leg is a little bit bent, your knees bent, so it looks like it's crooked a bit.
374496	375877	I can't do it with the full extension.
376177	376317	Hmm.
377718	377818	Ouch.
407665	409805	All the crap I did yesterday, though, didn't help.
411486	412046	Treat yourself.
412726	421868	You are getting a lot of birthday love in the chat because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
421888	425148	That's VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
425788	426248	It's interesting.
426268	432369	You went to San Francisco over the weekend yesterday because I'm going to San Francisco on Tuesday, but for a very different reason.
432409	434410	We're going to see Kylie Minogue in concert.
435090	436210	Why are you not taking me?
437438	458138	because tickets are expensive I could have paid for my ticket oh we bought them a long time ago I'm sorry but yeah well well fine I'm just gonna stay in my house honestly to Danny Minogue you could probably get a last minute ticket they always open up the day of okay now now now we're retreating
459548	460228	All right.
460268	462429	Well, let's say hello to Techmaster Loki.
462449	463109	Hi, Loki.
463129	464130	How are you?
472659	473340	I'm doing pretty good.
473380	473720	How about you?
474180	474901	I'm good.
475861	476282	Tired.
476502	478823	I had another show last night, which was great.
478843	479524	It was so good.
479564	480084	We had another show.
480124	482406	We had probably the world's most famous drag king.
482626	490712	Landon Sider was here performing with Nevermore Gorlesk, which I host a lot of their shows down at the Colonial here locally.
491252	504835	and it was really great to meet Landon Sider and work with him and lots of great, you know, they'll bring in a big headliner but then there's, you know, a good at least 10, 12, probably a dozen local acts that they do.
504855	512557	When I say local, I mean Bay Area, Northern California, up in the foothills that are all really good, you know, just some really cool like artistic stuff.
512597	515098	It's always a pleasure to host and do all that stuff, so.
515738	517519	Once in a while, I'll be able to talk about games.
517759	526902	Very rarely do I tell video game jokes, because it's not always that kind of crowd, but once in a while, I'll relate horror to Dead by Daylight, and I'll be like, who in the crowd plays Dead by Daylight?
526962	530463	And I'll make fun of it somehow, in a fun way.
532204	537906	Animal Crossing is a good game to make fun of, too, and I see that's what you have playing behind you tonight, as we are taping live at VOG Network.
538146	539967	Were you in an Animal Crossing mood today, or...?
541337	543459	No, not really.
543559	546221	I just, you know, we've been doing this this long.
546362	547863	Start running out of games to put in there.
547983	553288	No, I was thinking about it because I'm getting... It just shipped.
553308	556531	I'm getting a... What was it called?
558853	560755	It's a Retro Pocket Flip.
561035	562676	I'm trying to remember who the company puts it.
562756	567501	I think it's like... It's one of those emulation Android devices.
568488	572172	and it can do emulation for GameCube.
572432	574174	Oh, you were talking a little bit about this last week, yeah.
574855	581401	Yeah, GameCube, PlayStation, I mean, it goes pretty, this one is pretty powerful, so it goes pretty high up.
581722	585386	You can even emulate some Switch games on it.
586587	589049	So it kind of goes up to about that point.
589089	590271	Because surely that's legal.
591683	611160	uh yeah i mean this it's limited switch homebrew switch homebrew switch like yeah yeah i'd say like switch indie games you know or you know e-shop stuff or something like that if you wanted to do that kind of thing but um mainly it was for uh i want to just like have kind of a cool handheld with like a
613622	636036	I don't have the space nor the TV access to have a bunch of classic systems everywhere I have my Nintendo and that's about it and even that is sitting in a box somewhere I have all my games sitting in a cabinet getting dusty over here too, so I don't know Did I mention that Dan got me an Animal Crossing gift box full of stuff?
636437	638318	No, that's fine I've seen some of those
639187	644270	has the keychain, the throat blanket, a bento box, a water bottle, a beanie, and a drawstring bag.
645503	647884	I can't wait for them to announce a successor on Switch 2.
648424	650965	It's got to happen eventually, but it'll probably just be another year.
651045	651985	Yeah, maybe next year.
652025	652386	We'll see.
653206	660828	I want to go to our chat room, and Rinmari's in chat tonight saying, I started poking at my Animal Crossing New Horizons island again.
661369	665510	So, yeah, I mean, it's fun to go back and revisit Animal Crossing once in a while.
665610	668311	Heck, DarkSakura, you were playing Animal Forest for Hotmail.
668331	670171	Didn't the game crash unexpectedly?
670191	671132	It got very frustrating?
671352	671632	Yeah.
673233	686320	it's the emulation I use it's a little bit funky they are working on an E plus translation and I might try that one but
687700	694502	I wanted just to show off what the original one was like for people who had never seen it.
694522	698742	And I've actually played a demo of it back in the day.
701583	704063	There's some fundamental differences.
704223	707584	Of course, the games, believe it or not, are in the N64 one.
708484	710645	But you don't have...
712505	714366	I think the police station isn't there.
715527	720650	Of course, in all the Japanese versions, instead of the well at town, you have a shrine.
723011	723791	Gotcha.
725032	729974	Yeah, there's some fundamental differences, but the N64 version is pretty fun.
730215	737018	There's also a channel I was following that has how the code in
738939	747126	Because basically the GameCube version is really just the N64 version, just beefed up a bit.
747306	749028	Sure.
750189	755853	But there was one who goes through how sketch the code is and how you can easily manipulate it and crap like that.
756434	765822	And that the sprite for Blathers, or not sprite, but the model for Blathers is in the N64 one, but there was no museum.
766142	767243	Yeah, not yet, yeah.
768115	791614	so you know that they had it planned it used to be that the way to get I want to say Ice Climber was you had to send your cartridge or your save or however you were saving it to Nintendo for the N64 they would transfer it over to a GameCube safe card and then send it back with Ice Climber in your inventory
792165	801074	that's so convoluted like but no I mean that's what we did back then and that wasn't even that long ago the show was on the air when that was going on it's wild yeah
802217	805338	Anyway, I'm looking at some other comments in chat, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
805738	812741	We see Dolly Partner, hello, is in chat saying, or should I say yeehaw, saying, I just can't visit mine, talking about Animal Crossing.
813021	814701	I don't care too much about Tom Nook.
815061	815921	Sorry, icons.
815982	818862	Well, Tom Nook is how children learn about capitalism these days.
820123	822584	So, you know, Tom Nook is kind of like the original villain.
823524	827765	So I can see why, you know, people are a little hesitant.
828025	829646	People might be a little triggered by Tom's presence.
829666	830306	And he doesn't charge interest.
831813	832814	No, no, that's true.
833135	834817	Maybe they'll make him worse in the next game.
836339	838902	No, I like to think that he does a good deed.
839022	840664	I mean, money is money.
841045	841906	You gotta pay back.
842186	844309	When are they gonna let me put a guillotine in the town square?
844389	844710	Come on.
846552	847513	Send a warning shot.
847974	848395	Come on.
851471	855135	Justice for Tom Nook and Mr. Resetti.
855335	861461	Mr. Resetti is on the spectrum, like me, and his comorbid is OCD.
861561	865745	He's obsessed with resetting and doing things right.
865785	868087	He likes things just the right way, just like me.
868287	872271	He has trouble with social situations, just like me.
876008	877269	And that is true, Dolly.
877649	880811	I have a better chance paying Tom Nook than my student loans, to be fair.
881051	882212	Exactly, exactly.
882372	883153	Yeah, yeah.
883193	885174	I had to repay to pay off my student loans.
885434	888176	Yeah, you'll have to hope them student loans get forgiven.
888216	890538	And that's one thing Tom Nook won't do, is forgive loans.
890778	892059	So, good luck, good luck.
892119	893219	Never forgives, never forgets.
893239	896261	Except he never asks you to pay them back anytime soon.
896281	897182	That's true, that's true.
897222	898983	You can live in the shack forever if you want.
899023	899684	So there is that.
900044	900604	You only get what?
900624	902886	You get the gold Tom Nook statue or something, right?
902946	904547	When you actually pay that off the last house?
904947	905868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
923633	947954	so he's he's actually a lot kinder hearted you know just tanuki are are business oriented individuals that's all all right that's why i mean and honestly you know the reason why he is a tanuki is because tanuki are supposed to symbolize uh profit in business makes sense makes sense that's why they have big testicles because they're like money bags
950183	953590	I know that's where I store all my money, so it makes sense to me.
953610	955073	Do they call it a money shot?
956218	963222	All right, moving on, let's talk about a game where, you know, maybe you don't have... This is an adult show, by the way.
963502	975810	Maybe you don't have guillotines in Animal Crossing, but you certainly have decapitations in this next game, which, Loki, we've got, like, a rumor, but it's one of those things where it's like, this is beyond rumor at this point.
975890	981293	This is, you know, when you've got the screenshots to prove the evidence, this is... Yeah, it's leaked out, basically.
981313	982134	Yeah, it's happening.
982354	982414	It...
982934	999771	It's been rumored for a while, yeah, it's been rumored for a while that there's going to be an Oblivion remake, the fourth Elder Scrolls game, and now recently, as of, I believe it was last week, it got leaked onto...
1002472	1003413	Oh, God, what was the website?
1004214	1004934	There was a few things.
1004974	1014404	So first off, it was reported through a LinkedIn profile that there was a new game being worked in or a port being worked in Unreal Engine 5.
1015004	1024273	Then later on, the actual screenshots got leaked out as well as part of like, I don't know if it was like some sort of like marketing as...
1026337	1035390	Asset's website or something like that but essentially had side-by-side comparisons with the original game versus the remade game which looks pretty awesome.
1036372	1040037	The rumor is it's supposed to be out very soon and this was...
1041226	1044027	Sort of confirmed by the support bot.
1044907	1052109	The Xbox support bot basically said that it's supposed to be out at the end or is at the release on April 21st.
1052830	1054330	So I guess we'll see.
1054570	1055490	Probably soon.
1055890	1056931	It's certainly coming.
1058101	1062424	It's certainly coming, it's just like, when exactly are we actually going to see it?
1062484	1065166	But I would imagine sooner than later.
1065867	1075834	I mean, the 21st is tomorrow, so by the time most people hear this podcast, I mean, it should be up by the morning for people, but it'll probably already be out.
1076294	1078736	I wonder what might be driving it.
1078876	1083699	Like, you know, usually stealth drops happen as some part of, like, larger announcements sort of thing.
1083719	1085301	Like, it's just, it seems like a weird...
1086141	1088002	reason to just stealth drop this game and nothing.
1088042	1092843	I mean, are we getting maybe an Elder Scrolls 6 update that this will shadow drop alongside?
1092863	1093564	I mean, I don't know.
1093604	1102787	Like, I don't want to create expectations or something that's not there, but it is weird that this is being planned for a shadow drop when there's nothing else happening.
1102807	1103727	You know what I mean?
1103747	1110390	It almost feels like something that would, like, you would want to hold on to until, like, say you had your Xbox showcase thing.
1110510	1111070	Yeah, exactly.
1111110	1113571	And they'd be like, it's out now!
1113671	1114171	You know, like,
1114911	1116612	type of thing, but I don't know.
1116632	1123094	Maybe they want to be out now so they can make some extra bucks in this slow time of the year.
1123314	1124654	Now available on Game Pass.
1124674	1127215	I guess they've been adding some heavy hitters to Game Pass lately.
1127935	1132737	Diablo 3 finally went up on Game Pass, which that means 1, 3, and 4 are all on Game Pass.
1132877	1136218	It's just a matter of time, I'm sure, before they get Diablo 2 Resurrected up there as well.
1137258	1140459	They had that Blueprints game that's been everywhere.
1140559	1142220	A lot of people have been really enjoying that game.
1142720	1169114	that's up on Game Pass now too and I think it's on the PlayStation equivalent as well to be fair and then there's one other game that's escaped but I feel like there's like a lot of stuff that you know well there's the South of Midnight just came out what about a week ago that's a pretty big release too yeah so yeah there's a lot going on oh and you know what else is next week actually now I think about it Expedition 33 that whatever oh that's right yeah
1170137	1171317	That's coming out in the next week.
1171357	1173038	So it's going to be a big week for releases.
1173078	1173538	That's for sure.
1174638	1175038	Good times.
1175779	1190103	I also wanted to kind of bring attention to where you were talking about that the bot kind of like spoiled the actual release date because this to me is a really funny side effect of all of these companies leaning so hard into AI.
1190643	1204259	and this is a really shining example I think of the you get what you pay for with the AI technology is that the AI is not going to understand that nuance of an NDA and if it has access to that sort of information it's going to put it out there.
1204479	1209826	I think this is a really funny way that somebody figured out about this is by you know because
1210266	1236646	companies are investing so much into AI before I really think it's ready or accurate that's what this is an accuracy issue is that the accurate thing would have been to tell that person that oh we haven't said anything about that yet but it can't understand that sort of nuance yet I mean yeah one could argue AI will get better AI will get there or something but you know one thing AI is incapable of is that whole emotion thing so I don't
1237126	1237466	I don't know.
1237546	1245088	I thought this was a very interesting side effect that ought to have companies raising an eyebrow a little bit on how fast they implement AI.
1245128	1249569	They won't, of course, but this is the price to pay for that.
1251029	1256290	And I know the article said it was like that supposedly on social media you get real-life people and all that stuff.
1257210	1260411	I would bet that it's with an asterisk.
1260471	1262771	It's like you get real-life people at a certain point.
1263131	1266052	That doesn't mean that you get it right out the gate or anything like that.
1267052	1267873	Ranmari and Chat.
1267933	1268634	It doesn't matter.
1268674	1274859	I mean, either way, they still leaked it out through the support system, whether it's a bot or not.
1275100	1277662	Or maybe it could be third party that didn't know any better.
1277702	1278082	Who knows?
1278202	1279904	But yeah, you get what you pay for.
1280244	1284348	Ranmari and Chat also says, I am very apprehensive of AI for a bunch of reasons.
1284588	1285389	Oh, same.
1285469	1286210	I mean, I don't want to...
1287350	1305694	We've gone deep in this AI topic previously, and the parts where it can be a decent thing, that's how we're going to get to 8K, 12K, whatever is in the future for graphics, is those sorts of tools that help to speed that process up with refining art.
1305734	1310715	But that has to be something that's trained off of internal mechanisms and internal things, not things that are trained off of other people's
1311055	1312035	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1332660	1337403	People trying to replace these very complex mechanisms with AI, I think are in for a shock.
1337843	1342646	Like I'm hearing in all these different industries about how AI is like replacing jobs already.
1343267	1348470	And it's one of those, these, they're going to get what they pay for with those cutting those sets of corners.
1348530	1350031	Typically, that's the case.
1350091	1353013	I mean, that's how you have AI negotiating a car.
1354114	1354554	What was it?
1355454	1356675	Buying a car for a dollar?
1359697	1360818	Because they're like, you know.
1362037	1363839	Did you not say thank you yet?
1383387	1388570	Let's see, Rin Mari also says, my biggest fear is AI being used for deep fakes and spinning false narratives.
1388950	1395753	You know, once in a while, once in a blue moon, there's a funny one, but it's like, it's one of those like AI that's so bad, it's good.
1396193	1400695	So there was one with the whole, you know, Katy Perry in space was all the rage this week, right?
1401175	1401815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1420845	1424687	But yeah, I do agree that like that shit's going to become very problematic very fast.
1424927	1432330	And it's probably going to take a lawsuit, several lawsuits of somebody being shown doing something that they aren't actually doing.
1433671	1437913	And that taking steam in a major way for that to come to head.
1438053	1438953	But we'll see.
1439373	1439693	Who knows?
1440614	1440734	So.
1442593	1442873	All right.
1443734	1445196	What else do I want to say about the Oblivion remake?
1445316	1448400	Oh, are you going to... Would you play it when it comes out, Loki?
1448581	1449041	Probably.
1449181	1451785	It was one of the games... One of my launch games I had for the 360.
1452526	1456150	I haven't played it as much as Skyrim.
1456591	1457532	I'm hoping, though, like...
1458996	1463961	I'd probably be more interested in playing it on PC when it comes out, especially with all the modding and everything.
1464261	1465002	I think that'd be fun.
1465262	1467204	Yeah, yeah.
1467524	1476232	It's interesting that the mod, there is a mod already that makes this HD, but apparently the mod creators had somewhat good spirits about it, I guess.
1477413	1482137	And, you know, kind of realized that one of these HD remakes would be inevitable at some point, so...
1483358	1483578	Yeah.
1484639	1484819	Yeah.
1485299	1485659	It happens.
1485679	1486020	It happens.
1488121	1488361	Yeah.
1489081	1489502	We'll see.
1489542	1489842	We'll see.
1490222	1496245	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, my ex played Oblivion way too much and the music still gives me flashbacks to this day.
1496946	1497106	Yeah.
1498769	1500190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1519707	1521829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1545331	1554996	Um, I played like half a minute of this Sailor Moon beat-em-up in the little arcade.
1555016	1559499	I played some gachapon machines and, you know, some stuff like that.
1561080	1564161	Mostly it's been Dead by Daylight trying to get through the event.
1565422	1568404	I'm probably going to be doing some Killer tonight since I don't work tomorrow.
1569364	1572326	Unless, you know, the Swiftmates decide to come play.
1573526	1575787	Um, I'm really overdue for a play date.
1575867	1577808	I need to get in on that sometime.
1578028	1580909	I know you keep inviting me and I'm always, I've just been so like, it's weird.
1580969	1583410	I've actually been leaving the house and shit lately.
1583450	1586051	It's a weird feeling, but I really want to play with you again sometime.
1586071	1587811	We're not going to have much longer for this event.
1588272	1588532	Yeah.
1588612	1591033	Well, I mean, it's not like the game's going anywhere, but yeah.
1592853	1596295	Well, I mean, I, I mostly, you know, my thing is getting all the cosmetics and stuff.
1596695	1597095	Yeah.
1598653	1601575	Um, I, uh, I played Pollya.
1601855	1608398	I have almost finished my second property, which is a little witch in the woods kind of thing.
1608819	1612481	Um, I, I've learned how to do some design glitching.
1613641	1619224	So I have like some, some furniture merges and a few things out of bounds and it's pretty cool so far, you know?
1620045	1620125	Um...
1621205	1625348	I have a lamp growing out of the ground and the lamp is kind of like tree-ish.
1626208	1628290	So it looks really like it is growing out of the ground.
1628330	1628830	It's kind of cool.
1629831	1631332	I'm still playing Fruit Mountain.
1631432	1636395	I finally topped my 7,000 point score and got one over 8,000 points.
1636575	1637315	So that was really nice.
1640157	1643739	I'm playing my stupid Mahjong game.
1643759	1645040	I'm playing the Suika game.
1645060	1648042	I played a little Mass Effect.
1648623	1649163	Oh, fun.
1650789	1657830	and I'm actually, yeah, Mass Effect right now is probably qualifying as my Retro Knight question mark in Terabang.
1657850	1660251	It counts.
1661331	1662171	But I've been enjoying it.
1662251	1663891	I mean, it's fun.
1664591	1672313	I might... Palia is supposed to be getting an update with a new area on March 13th.
1673013	1676513	So I will be playing a shit ton of Palia when that happens.
1676813	1678174	So, yeah.
1678614	1679134	That's where we are.
1679614	1679814	Nice.
1681334	1685698	Alright, well, we'll move on to Loki in your gaming week.
1685898	1686918	How was your gaming week, Loki?
1687639	1689360	Just Minecraft, as usual.
1689661	1690721	I saw you got a new video.
1690741	1691902	You've been cranking out the videos lately.
1691922	1692283	Good for you.
1693243	1694144	Seven weeks in a row.
1694284	1694705	Good for you.
1695365	1704632	It's going to slow down here eventually, but yeah, it's been easy to do because I've just been building farms and stuff, so it's pretty quick.
1705453	1707074	But yeah, seven weeks in a row now.
1707094	1711775	Yeah, so it's just... I feel like your videos are getting some good views, too.
1712175	1712795	Like, lately.
1713135	1714596	Like, you're getting 1,000, 2,000.
1714656	1716156	Yeah, good for you.
1716716	1719217	Yeah, it comes and goes, though.
1719277	1721878	Because the next episode I put out could just...
1723218	1724279	Get a few views.
1724519	1725059	You never know.
1726100	1727801	Not that views are everything.
1727841	1730443	I mean, God knows we've done this show for as long.
1730523	1732024	But still, it's nice.
1732645	1733065	Here's the thing.
1733605	1734946	You work very hard on it.
1735426	1742091	And I know that... And I know that views are a metric that helps you get ads and money and that type of stuff.
1742131	1746614	And I do feel like you deserve that type of reward on YouTube.
1746754	1747835	I guess a lot of people do.
1747935	1749156	But you especially.
1749336	1750116	I'm biased, okay?
1750857	1751777	I know how hard you work.
1753679	1760443	It's watch time right now is what we need to get up because there isn't a whole lot of watch time.
1760463	1767228	There are people like finding it or it's getting pushed and then they're like, oh, hey, you know, and then they're like, ah, this is not for me.
1767328	1775254	So you need to push play and then go walk and do something or set up the favorite demo computers at Best Buy to be watching.
1775534	1776035	I'm just kidding.
1776055	1776395	I'm kidding.
1776435	1776855	Don't do that.
1777836	1778937	Yeah, because I want to get him in trouble.
1778997	1779157	But
1779918	1783261	Hey, stream it in the background a little bit while you clean the house.
1783861	1785103	Yeah, we'll get there eventually.
1785643	1791228	It's probably going to take something outside of the SMP stuff that I've been doing with Channel 64.
1791549	1797515	Because usually you get a larger audience with a single player series or...
1800103	1826054	modded or who knows so eventually I'll get there um I need to get to a point now where I'm doing a lot more planning and build designing and stuff so that's where it's gonna slow down it's not gonna be just making weekly episodes of stuff but you know I'm hoping to still be able to break up some of those projects a bit more because that was something I've struggled with for the past few seasons so we shall see if I can do that um but hopefully I can and then
1826474	1831138	Do you think the movie is bringing some eyes back to the Minecraft creation?
1832119	1834520	Not to me, because they're never pushing my stuff.
1834560	1839004	They're pushing the people that already have an audience, their things.
1839104	1844068	So you're getting Hermitcraft folks.
1845609	1849012	To be fair though, one of them at least, he was working on...
1850106	1852429	He was working with them on pre-production.
1852489	1857294	So he designed all of the stuff in the world.
1857915	1861579	Some of the Redstone stuff, they brought him in as a consultant to do all that.
1861619	1862400	So that was pretty cool.
1863981	1869467	But yeah, it's a lot of... It's always the big creators that get the same...
1870248	1886191	focus on all like the Minecraft stuff despite the fact that you know they have said several times hey shout out those small creators and we'll do blah blah blah you know do something with it and then it's like and so then I get like an attitude and be like I thought you said you're gonna do something with this.
1886471	1887811	Who won the Mega Man contest?
1887991	1889772	Who won the Mega Man contest?
1889872	1896833	I thought you were gonna do something like this you keep asking for small creators and you do nothing with it so like why am I gonna waste my effort to
1897847	1915429	Keep shouting out the same creators, especially when they're, like, small creators, and people are like, Grian, Mumbo Jumbo, it's like, they have 5 million plus views, or subs, they're not small, they're at the top, like, they're not unheard of, like, creators, like...
1916437	1918139	It's just funny.
1918159	1920061	SJ100Matt in chat says, I did get to see the movie.
1920122	1921503	It was a lot better than I expected.
1922544	1923586	I still have not seen the movie.
1926089	1929373	But I don't get out to the movies very often, which is a running theme on this show, so hey.
1930762	1931903	Alright, anything else, Loki?
1934364	1935125	My gaming week.
1935305	1938727	So I've actually picked up Final Fantasy XIV again.
1938767	1941028	I've been working on getting my machinist to level 100.
1941068	1943009	I've finally been working on the patch content.
1943069	1948653	And I'm actually really excited that we're finally getting an update to the game on Tuesday.
1948753	1953776	It's like a mini patch, but it's bringing the crafting gathering stuff, which tends to be...
1954136	1963719	I don't super get into crafting gathering, but I like the little competitive stuff that they put in that makes it more engaging and more interesting and gives you things to build for tickets and things like that.
1963819	1968041	So I'm excited for that to hit the game on Tuesday.
1968061	1971302	There's a lot of like everything we were just saying earlier.
1971322	1971802	There's that.
1972182	1972562	Expedition 33.
1972602	1975003	There's so much fucking hitting this week.
1975323	1976243	It's pretty crazy.
1976963	1977843	But I'm excited for that.
1978704	1979464	So I've been playing that.
1980084	1983905	I also, I don't think I talked about this last week, but I played a little bit last week and I played again this week.
1984025	1987566	I actually bought Tetris Grandmaster 4 on Steam.
1988426	1990206	And really, that's from all of you hyping it.
1990607	2000169	And some of the Tetris hype I was getting a little bit from when I played the Gold Master Collection, the Tetris one that Digital Eclipse did.
2000549	2011536	I forgot the actual name of that Tetris collection, the Tetris story or whatever that was, that actually explained a little bit of the differences on where Grandmaster came from.
2012196	2013277	Thank you, Tetris forever, Bobby.
2014778	2019500	Where that came from and why it's different and why people are really into the Grandmaster and stuff.
2019520	2020621	I sort of knew some of it.
2020661	2021742	I knew it played a little differently.
2022082	2023243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2044139	2055048	with a big asterisk because overall the game has some really mean, nasty, fast modes where it's like insta-drops, insta-drops, and you have to click things into place fast.
2055428	2056449	So it's wild.
2056589	2057050	It's wild.
2057670	2059291	RinMari says, I hate T-spin meta.
2059412	2061033	I prefer to spam Tetrises all day.
2061053	2062094	Yeah, that's the way I play too.
2062674	2067919	My brain is not thinking in a T-spin way yet, and maybe I need to watch some tutorials on how to do it.
2068259	2069300	That would probably up my game.
2069640	2071361	That helped me on my Luminous game.
2072382	2098819	I watched maybe 30 minutes of how to be a better Luminous player and once I started learning the trick about using like the three and one blocks and like using the nubs to create like squares and in the places where you needed them and stuff I was like oh my god I I can go a full round on Luminous now it only took me just kind of like seeing the game in a new way to do that so I need to do the same thing with Tetris quite honestly um but yeah I'm enjoying Grandmaster there is an interesting mode where all the blocks become big and
2099259	2100060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2114298	2118160	It thinks through the holds way faster than I do when I play Tetris.
2118180	2127644	So maybe that's my problem, too, is that I pretty much only put the straight line... Like, I'm sure a lot of you, you put the straight line brick in the hold, and then you kind of wait for it, and then you use that.
2127704	2133687	And maybe once in a while, like, if there's a Z brick that doesn't make sense, I'll throw that in the hold until I see an opportunity.
2133947	2134707	You know, that whole type of thing.
2134727	2137749	But my God, playing that mode, which Ranmari says is...
2138689	2144212	Kanoa Mode, which teaches you how to do that.
2144872	2152336	I was like, oh my god, the way you have to go back and forth with the holds is wild.
2153137	2155478	I don't have that brain capacity for Tetris.
2156118	2174630	so no wonder people prefer the NES version because it doesn't have a fucking hold but I do overall I like the hold mechanic I do I do so I'm just but yeah I've been playing Grandmaster 4 so congrats chat congrats chat you did it you did it you finally convinced me to get something that I got sucked into it's actually I will say where that game is really fun you
2174650	2175972	You are a grown ass man.
2176012	2177734	You made that decision all on your own.
2177754	2180539	Well, and to be fair, I've always kind of had a soft spot for Tetris, right?
2180579	2182962	Like Tetris Forever, Tetris Effect.
2183002	2183763	I loved them both.
2184224	2189632	And then, but y'all hyped up Grandmaster and I was like, all right, I should get on this bandwagon already.
2189952	2190953	I thought of another game I played.
2191053	2191893	Sorry, you reminded me.
2191933	2192714	I played some Luminous.
2212771	2213191	Oh yeah.
2213852	2214773	Hey, that's a classic.
2214853	2215454	One of my favorites.
2215514	2216214	One of my all-time favorites.
2218136	2220659	Because Alan and I have been doing a lot of walking.
2220679	2226524	We've been having a walking challenge at work and just generally we've been trying to like be better about health and stuff like that and just get out walking.
2227005	2227725	Let me tell you.
2227885	2230047	So like Pikmin Bloom is all about walking, right?
2230608	2235393	So we blew through that because Alan and I have both been trying to walk like four or five miles a day.
2236013	2238035	We blew through the flower challenge.
2238195	2239456	We have like a tradition.
2239816	2254867	Ever since I got Bobby Blackwolf and Mrs. Blackwolf into Pikmin Bloom, nearly every week, unless I forget or something goes awry, nearly every week I get the four of us into a flower planting challenge where you have to, as a group, plant 30,000 flowers.
2254907	2257449	You plant flowers by walking and turning it on, turning it off.
2257889	2258630	It's a lot less...
2259130	2260271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2282631	2283913	And so we keep getting all these tickets.
2284213	2286315	And Alan and I were like, should we do a second one?
2286696	2287116	And we did.
2287437	2290400	We did a second flower challenge by ourselves.
2291041	2291802	Just the two of us.
2291842	2293504	We had it open to see if anybody else would join.
2293544	2294024	Nobody else joined.
2294325	2296207	We did a second challenge by ourselves.
2297287	2298849	and DarkSakura.com
2314065	2329681	and I knew this was going to happen because every other fucking Niantic game and we're not talking about the sale that sale hasn't closed by the way so there's a lot of fans out there that are saying it's Scopely's influence this is what Scopely's doing Scopely Scopely Scopely it hasn't closed
2330342	2338128	Y'all, it's just been announced, but it's got a clear... So right now, at least, it is still Niantic's choices and all that stuff.
2338768	2341610	They have been doing all of these battles.
2341650	2345113	So Monster Hunter now, I think, was the first one that had a battle pass.
2346093	2353779	Pikmin Bloom's whole mechanic, it's not as battle pass-y, but it kind of feels like it, like the way they've kind of instituted in that game.
2353799	2354560	Yeah.
2356018	2359800	Pokemon Go has figured out a way to Battle Pass during special events.
2360160	2363562	They'll do points for catching Pokemon and all this stuff and all that.
2364063	2366044	And now Ingress has it too.
2366084	2370286	And I was like, well, this is just a matter of time because literally every other Niantic game has figured out how to Battle Pass.
2370626	2373348	So what they're doing is for Anomaly Seasons...
2374068	2376510	Now all the badges run off points.
2376990	2381153	And you get points by doing bounties, which a lot of this shit is new to Ingress.
2381173	2382815	They've only put it in the last couple years.
2383115	2384035	You do these bounties.
2384135	2388579	It's like capture two portals, walk two kilometers, throw one field.
2388599	2389660	You know, you do these things for points.
2390080	2393963	And those points go into the Anomaly Season, which runs for like two or three months.
2394383	2399967	And you get these rewards as you hit certain levels, including a different tiered badge for the Anomaly Season.
2400027	2400648	And sure enough...
2401348	2401888	Thanks for watching!
2420356	2420816	Terrible.
2421116	2422497	Terrible value, in my opinion.
2422998	2429461	Like, you get 25 Aegis shields, which are the most powerful shields in the game, but it's like, hack them, lazy.
2429901	2430622	Go hack.
2430662	2431642	Learn to overclock.
2431742	2435725	You don't need to buy a battle pass to get 25 Aegis shields.
2436658	2441342	Anyway, Rinmari in chat says, to be honest, I don't care for the licensed GPS games.
2441802	2444304	I like Ingress because it has original lore.
2444624	2447507	I remember going to an Anomaly event in SF in 2013.
2447627	2448888	I really liked the social element.
2449168	2450549	Hell yeah, I think I was at that event.
2450569	2454472	Or at least I was at one, maybe 2018 was when I went to San Francisco Anomaly.
2454512	2456754	But yeah, the in-person events are a lot of fun.
2456814	2460617	Like, I like Ingress because it's never dull, because of the player versus player element.
2461057	2463639	As frustrating as that can be sometimes, because it's like...
2464440	2469485	That fucking retired guy that plays all fucking day long came and took down my fucking portals and threw a field.
2469505	2476493	You know, as frustrating as that whole thing can be, it's one of those things where it's like, but like, it's like motivating for me to get it back out, walk and just fucking throw it again.
2476973	2478435	And it's never a dull moment.
2478675	2479476	So I don't know.
2479636	2481338	It keeps me, it keeps me on my toes.
2481458	2481958	What can I say?
2482239	2482759	I have a good time.
2483020	2486543	And then, yeah, the social events are a lot of fun, but I still fear...
2487742	2489143	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2506158	2515024	And that's going to be what Niantic is going in to train their world awareness, you know, AR stuff that they can build AR gaming off of.
2515104	2516365	That's the long term plan.
2516705	2519947	They want to build what the world looks like to help with AR gaming and all that crap.
2520448	2521649	So it'll be interesting.
2521749	2527933	But I'm curious how Ingress and Scanaverse that are almost certainly likely to fuse together is going to get them there.
2528513	2536035	Anyway, enough talk about a game very few of you play, but I do think it's very influential in that AR gaming space, and it is worth keeping an eye on.
2536255	2542497	Again, without it, you would have never got Pokemon Go, which took over the world in 2016 and, you know, still does very well for itself.
2542798	2546579	And Pikmin Bloom, Monster Hunter Now, both really decent games if you give them a try.
2547139	2548579	I talk about them for a reason.
2548599	2549060	I enjoy them.
2549720	2549960	All right.
2550860	2551181	Damn it, Rob.
2551201	2551541	Damn it, Rob.
2551561	2551961	Damn it, Rob.
2574298	2580140	Nintendo had halted pre-orders on the Nintendo Switch 2, which was originally supposed to take place on April 9th.
2580720	2582281	But now we have the new date.
2582541	2584121	It will launch April 24th.
2584461	2589323	This has also been confirmed by other partner retailers as well.
2589343	2594245	Like Target shows that theirs are going to go up midnight Eastern on the 24th.
2596345	2618654	of course the two versions that will be available the system by itself and then of course the bundle with Mario Kart World for $4.99 now the console prices have stayed the same but the accessories have gone up and so now the accessories are going to be even more expensive so the Switch 2 Pro Controller went up $5 from $80 to $85 Joy-Con 2's are now $95 instead of $90
2623596	2627281	The crappy camera is $55 instead of $50.
2630506	2632008	So yeah, that kind of sucks.
2632429	2635954	But you don't necessarily need all that stuff.
2637676	2638838	You can wait for a sale maybe.
2640103	2654401	Or he can wait for this cockadoody tariff stuff to, you know, for you-know-who in charge to change his mind again or somebody to slap some sense into him or something where they realize that this whole thing was a very, very bad idea.
2655543	2656163	I mean, you know...
2658021	2659022	Take it with a grain of salt.
2680672	2681974	It will change the day after.
2682515	2683296	Yes, exactly.
2684097	2690406	Mike Deft in chat says, you know, that's a good part of this is that you don't really need any of these accessories if you already have Switch One stuff.
2690486	2691307	And that's where I'm at.
2691427	2693150	I don't really need that camera.
2693590	2696074	It's a cute idea, but sure, you know.
2696434	2719410	they like was that they were showing off they did like a funny little bit because you know Paul Rudd was in the original Super Nintendo um console control um commercial and so now they had him reprise that role or whatever for the Switch 2 and they were just showing off like Mario Kart uh world gameplay and the camera and just like the the
2720612	2723636	The screen sharing type stuff that's going on.
2723676	2725298	It looks so bad.
2725618	2727300	Like, the games look good.
2727520	2729423	The idea of chatting with your friends look good.
2729443	2730824	But that screen share thing.
2731909	2733651	Just... They should have just cut it out.
2733711	2736894	Like, it's not necessary because it looks awful.
2737034	2745542	It looks... It looks like when we first used... I mean, granted, when we first used to stream this show, like, it was one frame every 10 seconds.
2745662	2746282	Yep.
2746502	2748885	But eventually, it wasn't great either.
2748985	2751647	It was like, you know, 12 frames per second or something like that.
2752908	2753109	Like...
2754448	2755409	20 years ago.
2756049	2758391	There's still archive video from 2006.
2759131	2767177	There's us playing the Final Fantasy XIII demo on our fucking cable internet connection in the old garage studio.
2767577	2771199	There's an Orange Lounge Twitch channel out there.
2771260	2776323	We haven't used it in a very long time, but there's archive footage still there to this day from way back when.
2777023	2778224	It just looks so bad.
2778364	2780165	I get it.
2780506	2783748	The voice chat stuff's good, but man, that does not represent
2784308	2786010	The console very well.
2786470	2791935	You should have just cut that feature because it wasn't really necessary and it's half-baked.
2792155	2793376	But the rest is fine.
2795778	2797579	They had a Mario Kart Direct, which is kind of cool.
2797599	2798380	They got the show off.
2799861	2804685	So the classic tracks are remixed and mixed in the world as well, so that's kind of neat.
2805346	2810871	And they have a bunch of new weapons and stuff, new items in the boxes that you can do, so that's pretty cool.
2812659	2823669	Yeah, I'm excited about the game, but like, man, that commercial just did not do that camera and that feature justice at all.
2823749	2825030	It's just awful.
2825450	2825951	Or maybe it did.
2825991	2827132	I mean, it's just an awful feature.
2828784	2835166	I'm looking in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, going back to the talk about Washington being unpredictable.
2835827	2840588	Jay Helinski in chat says, I predicted there is insider trading going on in D.C.
2840628	2843189	Well, that's a safe bet that you can know.
2843249	2844490	That's the one bet I would take.
2845230	2848011	Corruption in my administration?
2848251	2849732	There's already evidence of it.
2849752	2850132	Centipedes?
2851608	2870758	it's just because you see oh hey look at that that's weird there's like heavy trading right before the announcement of this this thing happens that's so strange that it just so happened to be that these people traded all these stocks right before you know this announcement made that they would certainly be aware of hmm
2873177	2877942	Anyway, I will definitely try to get a Nintendo Switch 2.
2878883	2882027	I'm glad that the price isn't going up, all things considered.
2882808	2889575	I'm assuming that Nintendo is taking a somewhat calculated risk that they have enough stock in the warehouses to help kind of see them through for a little bit.
2889895	2899518	That maybe they don't have to bring any more over until hopefully this whole thing, you know, somebody fucking gets the president to attack dog something else and go back on this tariff thing.
2899578	2906760	But, you know, or or or heaven forbid, Congress fucking step in and say, which, by the way, they could do tomorrow.
2907080	2913622	Tomorrow, Congress could step in and say, actually, Congress could well, actually, this entire thing.
2913722	2914542	Well, actually.
2915362	2916583	There's not an emergency.
2917063	2921026	Because the president has rights to declare these tariffs when there's an emergency.
2921906	2924768	But Congress can step in and say... It's not even an emergency.
2924808	2927530	It's when we're at war, which we are not at war.
2927550	2931552	But they're like, oh, we're fighting the war on fentanyl.
2931972	2933073	Okay.
2933833	2934934	That's what we're waiting for.
2934954	2939637	That's what we're waiting for Congress to do is say, well, actually, there's not a war.
2940117	2941898	So null and void.
2943239	2944080	They could do it tomorrow.
2945350	2948972	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2975913	2982138	Well, then you also have to, you figure too, you know, some of these corporations do want this kind of stuff to happen.
2982158	2994627	They want people to not be able to afford things so that they can swoop in or assuming that basically he tanks the market, they swoop it in and get a deal on all these stocks and then the market eventually recovers.
2995307	2998448	But they, you know, were able to swoop in and acquire more wealth.
2998748	3004370	Yeah, so, but anyway, I will get a Switch 2, but the accessories can wait.
3004630	3012972	I mean, I wanted to get a Pro Controller, but I'm not, like, I'm just fundamentally against paying for these things wherever I can prevent it.
3013032	3020694	And I don't, as much as I love doing this show, video games are not a necessity, and I can cut that out to avoid this.
3020754	3022755	You know, other things like groceries and shit,
3023215	3027017	and things that are imported from other countries that, you know, are in salads and shit like that.
3027057	3027958	I'm not going to have a choice.
3027998	3032381	But where I can cut it out and do that stuff, you know, is going to make sense.
3032421	3033581	And that's just what I'm going to have to do.
3034502	3034982	So we'll see.
3035603	3041006	Anyway, in that segment, Loki was talking a little bit about a Mario Kart World Direct.
3041466	3043327	And yes, a Mario Kart World Direct.
3043367	3044708	It did happen this week as well.
3045048	3047590	This was their opportunity to show why this game is worth $80.
3047650	3049591	And, you know, that's an opinion.
3052893	3057216	If this game is worth $80, that's your question to answer.
3058877	3065922	But some of the features that they were showing were things like the Grand Prix races, knockout tours, battle mode, free roam.
3066182	3068804	So of course we know there's an interconnected world, right?
3068844	3074048	So we know it's like a big open world, kind of like a Forza game, but for Mario Kart, which again, that's no shade.
3074608	3082871	Forza Horizon is a fucking high bar in racing, and the fact that Mario is taking inspiration from that is a good thing.
3082971	3086392	That's where that innovating in the genre stuff, that's great.
3086852	3087893	I have no problem with that.
3087973	3095896	I mean, maybe I have a problem with all of these things being in one game leading to that high price, but...
3096556	3099177	You know, that's for Nintendo to figure out, you know.
3099217	3104140	I mean, Forza was at $90, so I'm kind of confused as to why this one is.
3104240	3104500	True.
3105620	3108902	Well, but you say that, but...
3109875	3123521	Forza had a game of the year edition, or not a game of the year, an early access advanced launch where you could play the game early and had the super bundle of the game that included both season passes, which were an additional, what, 15, 20 bucks on top of that and all this other stuff.
3123561	3131905	So I do somewhat have an issue because it goes back to that whole thing when it's like, well, these other games are cheap, but it's like, well, are they?
3132165	3134526	Because they're not really giving you the full thing out the gate.
3135146	3144910	Right, but then also, are we going to really believe, like, we're going to sit here and believe that Nintendo's never going to release any sort of DLC for this game?
3144950	3146431	It's complete as is.
3147191	3147671	Please.
3148171	3149692	Like, no.
3149792	3151753	Especially in the character department, for sure.
3152373	3153693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3177460	3178841	Then of course you can just do free roam.
3178901	3181102	Just roam around the world and do whatever the hell you want.
3181422	3182162	That's kind of neat.
3182263	3186144	I mean that's like, you know, that's why people loved Zelda Breath of the Wild, right?
3186164	3187285	It was a lot of that free open stuff.
3187305	3191287	I like that there's collectibles in the game.
3191387	3192407	I think that's cool.
3192768	3197570	That very much feels like... You mean like barns with cars in them type of thing?
3198070	3199270	Well, yes, that too.
3199391	3201351	But now I'm talking about like... Billboards to drive through?
3201431	3201671	Yes.
3201951	3203452	Yeah, more Burnout Paradise.
3203492	3203732	Yeah, yeah.
3203832	3205233	I gotcha, I gotcha.
3205353	3207333	It's a staple of the genre and all that.
3208374	3211335	Battle Mode is going to be back, which is, you know, fun.
3211355	3214316	That was always fun on the classic... The classic Super Nintendo one was great.
3215356	3217937	There's 24 racers at a time, as we know.
3218697	3223097	Game Chat, they're talking about, and camera play and all that stuff, if that's of interest to you.
3223558	3224718	Lots of characters.
3224898	3227338	I mean, they're talking about all these things in the direct.
3227938	3231279	And yeah, like, I'm going to pick up the bundled version.
3231599	3236580	Hopefully, we're assuming that they're going to be relatively easy to get if you're on there at midnight.
3237000	3238480	I'm not sure that's going to be the case.
3238940	3243781	I think many people are kind of going, okay, I'm going to try to get the target.
3243801	3243941	Oh, yeah.
3244161	3244782	Pre-order.
3244802	3245362	Scalpers, for sure.
3245622	3248165	And then I'm going to try to get this pre-order.
3248425	3249746	Hopefully one of them comes through.
3250787	3251768	So we'll see.
3253050	3257234	Well, speaking of scalpers, let's go to what DarkSakura has to talk about.
3261380	3261760	There we go.
3262100	3274647	Well, you know scalpers are gonna scalp, but Japanese retailers have actually been reaching out to ask the public what they would suggest for combating scalpers.
3275788	3275888	And
3277879	3286946	One of them put out a social media post that said Nojima Online was asking people what their ideas were.
3287966	3297773	And one user, Tatsuya, said to make customer show identification, open the instruction manual, the inside of the box, protected plastic, et cetera, write their names on it.
3298654	3303997	And another one said that selling the console out of the case
3305098	3333435	making customers sign a warranty in their own name, quizzing people on Nintendo knowledge another user was saying had to state what about the Twitch 2 makes them want to buy it honestly enough it's a slim at one console per person I mean, or one or two but if you've got like a group of people who are acquiring them for resale
3336006	3359754	That's a different story I do like the idea of them being serialized and having the serial number registered This is my idea anyway Having the serial number registered to the buyer Interesting Yeah, but gifts and stuff I mean, I don't know
3361874	3366955	Well, you know, then they also would mark that this is a gift and who the recipient is.
3368995	3369495	I suppose.
3369855	3378977	So, you know, so that it has to be registered or even like some sort of biometric scanner, I don't know.
3381017	3391199	But, I mean, in the end, what somebody does with what they buy is up to them, but there's only so much one can do to limit
3393874	3394614	those purchases.
3396495	3414399	I think that at least making them serialized and having serial numbers registered to the buyer and that way as well or even for the resale sites make a requirement for them that they have to post the serial number at time of sale.
3418741	3420241	That's all I can think of.
3421936	3424297	Um, or just let people fight about it in the parking lot.
3424417	3424857	I'm just kidding.
3425217	3426317	Um, let's see.
3426377	3427177	Looking in- Fight clope, yeah.
3427317	3428037	Yeah, exactly.
3428337	3433138	Uh, OrangeRiteChat says, one scalper showing up with various glasses and fake mustaches.
3433238	3433438	Yes.
3433838	3439359	Uh, SSJ100Matt, I think with the best point here is the best way to combat scalpers is to not buy from them.
3439779	3440720	Let them go broke.
3440820	3447721	Unfortunately, the wrong people are not hearing the- or the- the- like, the people hearing that message are not the people that need to hear that message.
3448186	3449927	Consumerism will win every time.
3450067	3451167	Yeah, which is unfortunate.
3451367	3457250	And I do have to state right now that the use of slippery slope as an argument is inherently fallacious.
3458870	3464813	So I can't really talk to an argument about that since it's based on speculation.
3469735	3471916	Maybe they should be under some kind of DRM.
3473991	3480755	Jay Helinski in chat says it's a slippery slope because it could very quickly turn into a DRM.
3481276	3485738	In the end, in a consumerist market,
3497347	3498812	You've got to give the consumer the demand.
3498832	3504128	If the demand isn't there from the original source, then they're going to go to the secondary market.
3505160	3522249	I sort of think this is why I think Nintendo's way of how they're selling it on their official, because that's the one thing we haven't heard the pre-order details from, and I think might be out of sight, out of mind for some people, is that Nintendo is also selling them directly through their own warehouse or whatever channels, and they're requiring you to have a Nintendo Online.
3522350	3534036	I don't know if they require the subscription, but you have to have an online account and at least 50 hours registered in playing games before the day they announced it, which, you know, people that play enough video games regularly
3534176	3535536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3549321	3550722	Best Buy can't measure to that.
3550782	3552023	Target can't measure to that.
3552083	3555085	That's only something that Nintendo can do first party.
3555125	3564733	And if that was the only way to get a Switch, then it would turn into a whole antitrust thing because they sort of have to release some stock the other ways as well.
3564773	3566454	But I wonder if there's going to be a lot.
3566834	3570597	I wonder if it's going to be that situation where there's like one or two of them per Target.
3571238	3574340	We're kind of assuming, I think, a lot of people that there's going to be a lot of them.
3574360	3575361	I think it's going to be better than that.
3575521	3603881	I hope so I hope so but what was it didn't they release something where it was like there was four of them was it those NES classes or something people were just and it was like oh a store would get like four of them five of them maybe but like yeah I think there's obviously they're gonna make sure there's enough stock I mean that's the whole whole thing I can't imagine it's gonna be like four per target or something like that with the amount of pre-orders they're gonna be getting yeah I don't know yeah
3605526	3609668	All right, well, let's move on for another development about the Switch 2.
3610448	3610728	Loki.
3612709	3626456	Yeah, so, I mean, I don't know if this is much of a surprise, considering what, you know, Xbox has already been doing with the Switch, importing games over, but Phil Spencer says that Xbox will bring games to the Switch 2 as well.
3627176	3628117	I mean, kind of, duh.
3628357	3628497	Yeah.
3629423	3633304	It's nice to have it confirmed, right?
3633444	3658053	So we've been supporting Switch 1 I want to support Switch 2 Nintendo has been a great partner and I think it's a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players who aren't players on Xbox It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about franchises that we have and it's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games Yeah, I mean
3660230	3664231	I certainly thought that we could count on this stuff to be on there.
3664271	3671493	And I would be surprised if we haven't already seen some games that they've announced for the Switch 2 already.
3673833	3675134	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
3676314	3677694	I'd be surprised if they didn't.
3678715	3680435	Yeah, right.
3682005	3682925	We're not going to support Switch 2.
3682965	3684326	To hell with them.
3684506	3685146	We're EA.
3686726	3689727	SJ100Matt says Diablo is technically an Xbox game that's on Switch 2.
3689967	3691927	Did they confirm Diablo 4 yet for Switch 2?
3692248	3696529	I think that was in one of their little trailer things.
3696569	3700950	It's hard for me to make heads and tails of it, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if they confirmed that.
3701010	3701930	It would make a lot of sense.
3702030	3702870	Why not, right?
3703610	3704330	Yeah, let's see.
3704350	3704831	Let's see.
3706531	3717659	I was going to say that Microsoft has also shown up recently in Battle.net a little more because, you know, they have Activision Blizzard and Battle.net kind of goes back to the Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo types of days.
3717759	3721102	They're adding Sea of Thieves to it, which is kind of interesting.
3721582	3734071	And you also can work your game pass through Battle.net now because you actually play like classic Diablo, Diablo three and you play a lot of that through Battle.net as opposed to the Xbox client, which is kind of interesting.
3734892	3735032	So.
3736133	3736393	Yeah.
3736593	3736733	Yeah.
3754372	3754853	Everything X-Box
3772170	3772630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3801610	3802170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3821261	3833447	Lots of games added to the library of supported games, including Disney Epic Mickey, Lego Marvel Super Heroes, lots and lots that you can see on the Xbox website if you want to check that out.
3834361	3857437	I have not really used this feature a lot uh one thing I have used though is that on my computer I will stream from the Xbox downstairs you can just do like a live play where you just see it like it's on your TV it's streaming through like your home internet instead of out through the cloud or whatever it's just streaming on the home internet and I have played uh some Xbox games that way obviously the delay is kind of eh but um sometimes if I want to like
3857737	3866582	Unlock Achievements in Diablo 4 or something, you can stream a game that way or just play something that for whatever reason is on Xbox but not my PC, which I really can't think of a lot.
3866762	3867862	I think most of it is.
3869403	3869723	There you go.
3871304	3872325	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3874770	3875991	Whale.
3876252	3881156	The Gaming Awards 2025, they've announced the nominees.
3883118	3887743	That is to be... I can't make words happen today.
3888323	3892547	There are three nominations for Dragon Age The Veil Guard.
3894709	3903732	and a few others coming out, but it's being broadcasted on World of Wonders WoW Presents Plus on Tuesday, July 8th, 2025.
3905592	3916136	So other nominees include Life is Strange, Double Exposure, Dragon's Dogma 2, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Paper Mario, Fear the Spotlight, Caravan Sandwich.
3918096	3927378	Game of the Year nominees are Dragon Age The Veil Guard, Dragon's Dogma 2, Fear the Spotlight, Life is Strange, Double Exposure, Paper Mario, and The Last of Us Part 2.
3930338	3938160	We've had nominations for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Sorry We're Closed, Kitsune Tales, a few others.
3938180	3942340	So there's quite a number of... I don't want to tease them all.
3942480	3945281	People should watch it if they want to know more.
3946769	3947811	Get that viewer count up.
3948172	3948412	Yep.
3950216	3950517	All right.
3951338	3953382	Cool to see that support still going on.
3954545	3954825	All right.
3955226	3956088	Well, let's move on.
3956188	3956428	Loki.
3958174	3962876	All right, well, I mean, not to be left out in the dust by Nintendo.
3963477	3966458	Sony is here to say, hey, guess what, guys?
3967359	3968799	We can raise prices, too.
3968939	3969460	Why not?
3969560	3970240	It's fun.
3970280	3971280	Everybody's doing it.
3971501	3976343	So they're going to increase the price of PlayStation Plus in 20 countries.
3977464	3981806	This is right after, of course, they raised the price of the PlayStation 5 as well.
3982566	3986051	So, essentially... Well, it's only going to get worse if those tariffs stay in place.
3986091	3988994	Those PlayStation 5s are going to cost you twice as much during the holiday.
3989135	3989475	Good luck.
3989816	3990076	Right.
3990176	3995263	Well, I mean, but this is even... These are countries outside of the United States as well.
3996905	3998226	So, essentially, the...
3999928	4002490	Three tiers of PlayStation Plus that they have.
4002530	4006553	So Essential, which was $95 a year, is now going up to $110.
4006593	4009175	The Extra, which is $155 a year, is now $190.
4009676	4012778	And Premium, which was $190, is now $225.
4021663	4036468	and uh you know the reason for this well I don't know they didn't give one but no I'm assuming it's basically to uh keep putting out more content on there I guess things are getting more expensive or something like that
4038612	4046714	But yeah, so this is going to happen in 15 Latin American countries, 5 Southeast Asian nations, and South Korean Australia.
4047294	4048255	Man, poor Australia.
4048295	4052796	They get just jacked when it comes to pricing all the time.
4055397	4055957	Yeah, that sucks.
4057797	4058477	But we can roll it.
4059698	4063579	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, the only console not getting a hike, the Intellivision Amigo.
4065899	4066159	DarkSakura,
4086575	4091839	but you don't really hear often about how there's a lot of BS that's on PlayStation 5 as well.
4092440	4099505	In fact, three companies, developers were delisted from the PlayStation store in this past week.
4099906	4103629	Adventure Games, Gaming Dev and Grizzly Games.
4104169	4113796	You know, there are things like there's a lot of shovelware and things that will try to name themselves similar to popular games like there's a flight simulator VR.
4113816	4115998	They'll just steal the code in publishing
4116238	4126065	I think that was one of the ones that was delisted this week is I think one of these companies was making a game that was Repo Ghost Hall.
4126766	4132870	But we all know that's a big popular game right now is that REPO, you know, that Repo is big on Twitch right now and stuff.
4132890	4134331	So they had their own version of it.
4135132	4137433	This one of these companies and that's been taken down.
4137514	4139755	And so, you know, they just have it's a bunch of garbage.
4140296	4140556	Yeah.
4142188	4157617	I guess there's a bunch of like XXX language quiz games that are out there as well which sound like they were probably generated by AI because I was reading a Reddit post about it and somebody was saying that I checked out the one in my native language and it was full of errors.
4158680	4160721	Probably because those games were generated by AI.
4161081	4162622	Let's say what it is.
4165203	4176767	It sounds like Sony maybe does not have the people power to be reviewing all of these in a timely manner, and something's going to have to give on this front because a lot of that crap starts to look bad on them.
4177308	4180809	Well, this has been an issue for a long time.
4180889	4181049	I know...
4183030	4206726	was it uh Stephanie Sterling kept pointing out I think it's Guilford B. Pontus or something like that that puts out like these games that are kind of like souls like games but they're like barely functional and he's been doing that for god I think he's published several games for like the last like 10 years or whatever and they've all been just shovelware garbage so I'm sure there's plenty of
4207799	4212902	Other than these three, plenty of studios putting out that content.
4213983	4217185	Bobby in chat says a lot of the shovelware is platinum trophy farms.
4217305	4219186	Play for 10 minutes and get an easy platinum.
4219366	4219587	Yeah.
4220589	4221609	And why would you do that?
4221629	4224350	Just to make your score go up?
4224490	4236332	Some people get really weird about the size of their E-Penis on their Platinum Trophy, but also technically you get an elevated PlayStation Plus level by earning trophies.
4237433	4240253	But there's really nothing you get out of that.
4240513	4242894	They say it's priority access of voice chat.
4242934	4243854	What the fuck does that mean?
4244274	4245214	What the fuck does that mean?
4245494	4246194	It doesn't mean anything.
4246214	4247095	It's E-Penis, like you said.
4247175	4248275	Yeah, it's E-Penis, exactly.
4248735	4251938	Which we're, and so, yeah, and Rin Marichat says, achievement culture, da-da-da.
4252418	4267971	I can say all that, but still kind of sort of wish that Nintendo would implement some sort of system on their platform, because I do like the whole, like, I loved where we were going last week, on last week's show, talking about this, where maybe instead of just straight up, like, points, trophies, like, it's a sticker book.
4268232	4271995	And I think we had used Pokemon Home, was it Home?
4272015	4272095	Yeah.
4272815	4280842	One of the Pokemon things is an example of like you put stickers and you use the stickers that you get from different collecting achievements to build your profile picture.
4280922	4282343	And it's really cute, you know, type of thing.
4283324	4285946	I think that would be like a cute thing for Nintendo to implement.
4286026	4287167	But, you know, what do I know?
4287187	4289348	I'm just, you know, some guy with a podcast.
4289989	4296934	So anyway, as part of this podcast every week, we like to take down, take a trip down memory lane in our next segment.
4296994	4298576	So let's get to it.
4309750	4317033	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4317493	4320055	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4321195	4324216	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight for the classic game?
4325937	4327578	I have picked Wonder Project J.
4329521	4348426	which is a game that's been on my list for me to play I mean, I own a real copy well, we can see what happens but basically, Wonder Project J is a game that came out in 1994 for Super Famicom and it's a life simulation game it was developed by
4349546	4357369	Almanic, which is A-L-M-A-N-I-C Corp, and published by Enix for Super Famicom.
4357989	4364051	You play of a boy, Gijin, a robot, created by Dr. Geppetto, and his name is Pino.
4364671	4364971	Get it?
4365452	4366132	It's in Pinocchio.
4367312	4394122	it was directed by Yoneda Takashi and it was made by most of the same people who worked before on Evo Search for Eden and it was a pretty positively received game and one of the best selling Super Famicom games it even spawned a sequel, Wonder Project J2 that came out in 1996 on N64 so you play as this boy named Pino
4394622	4418371	who has a lot a lot of animation to make him seem more human to the player and he has a fairy sidekick named Tinker who acts like a point and he's like the the cursor in a point and click game she is um and you have to educate Pino to make him more human you can scold him when he does something wrong and praise him when he does something right kind of virtual pet like
4420217	4421759	You collect different items to the game.
4422039	4440018	Some are used to train different parts of his character, like strength and kindness, and some are used to adjust his parameters, like giving him pudding will increase his trust, but batteries increase his health, and others are teaching him behaviors, like sowing seeds, fighting with a sword, things like that.
4441379	4453663	He needs to succeed in various challenges and different confrontations to activate a virtue circuit that finally lets him activate Circuit J. The tasks are all based on different parameters of his character.
4454123	4455984	If he's strong enough, is he lucky enough?
4457044	4462866	And the final circuit will help him foster his relations between humans and other Gijin.
4464278	4465179	He has two health bars.
4466221	4468725	One is physical and the other is mental health.
4469666	4474453	Physical tasks or getting hurt will reduce physical health.
4475194	4480341	Reading a book or getting your feelings hurt reduces your mental health and some might do both.
4481263	4503958	so you have to help him restore both types of health by you know you can spend money you pass let the day pass um you know giving him different tasks that increase those things so um the game was a uh
4506013	4506193	And, um...
4526614	4531120	Really was wanting just to do something different.
4531220	4533202	The game was never published outside of Japan.
4533242	4536586	There is a fan translation.
4536706	4541232	In 1995, Hamitsu's reader crush review gave the game a 7 out of 10.
4541272	4541452	It sold...
4545337	4560978	1.3 million units in Japan Hardcore Gamer said that it was a very positive game and in 2011 1up.com's Bob Mackey said it was one of the six must-play Super Nintendo imports
4562213	4571682	So there was that sequel, Wonder Project J2, which was developed by Givro Corp, which was previously Omnic, and released by Enix for N64.
4572203	4576507	And it was one of the last projects that Givro did before their company dissolved in 1998.
4576947	4583353	It was re-released by Squenix as a two-part download for mobile phones in Japan in 2010.
4583593	4585495	And that is it.
4585675	4586236	Wonder Project J.
4588407	4593972	We have not done all of the MX games, I can tell you that right now Yeah, I've done a few, but certainly not all
4613444	4613725	All right.
4614346	4615688	Well, let's oops, not that one.
4615728	4617791	Sorry, I was running the wrong thing there for a minute.
4617831	4625444	But let's get back into the show and some more gaming news in a segment that we call Rapid Fire News.
4626125	4627507	Some other quick headlines from the night.
4627567	4627827	Loki.
4629509	4645162	Bethesda, you know, the company that's piecemealing everything when it comes to Elder Scrolls now is allowing you for the 10 year anniversary of Elder Scrolls Online to own some of its RAM from its server it doesn't need anymore.
4646463	4657652	So you can pay $110 to pre-order it and they're having 2,000 sticks of RAM that are going to be included in this
4659491	4664134	Anniversary gold-plated plaque thing that you can have.
4665434	4670097	Sounds like, to me, a way that they could just upgrade the RAM without having to actually pay for it.
4670537	4673439	They did that with World of Warcraft, though, didn't they?
4673479	4674079	They sure did.
4674119	4675200	At some point, they did, yeah.
4675760	4676481	I don't know.
4676541	4679783	One of the original Warcraft games, they were selling RAM sets.
4681224	4688308	But if it's something that you're interested, you better get on it now because there's only 2,000 and they're going to be delivering those in July.
4689821	4691868	Um, yeah.
4692719	4696902	Anyways, quickly, TigerClaw in chat says, hopefully it's RAM that's compatible.
4696942	4699503	If you need more RAM in your PC, I don't think it's that cut.
4699523	4700184	It's not server RAM.
4700204	4701765	It's server RAM, which is going to be different.
4701785	4702985	And it's probably old.
4703305	4705427	Yeah, I don't think it would help your computer that much.
4705647	4709029	So unless you're going to, if you want to start your own bootleg server, maybe.
4709069	4714412	But I really think this is just some, I remember when they sold those Warcraft servers that DarkSakura was talking about.
4714452	4716413	It was like the classic WoW servers.
4716533	4718335	I watched someone buy one of those.
4718695	4720476	Yeah, they went for thousands of dollars.
4721243	4721983	California Extreme
4744717	4756280	For Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, they just revealed a brand new patch that adds a few things, including offline versus for all games, as well as a few other options.
4756420	4760141	So some of the things added in there, X-Men vs. Street Fighter gets a version selection.
4760161	4762702	You can actually pick which version of the game you want to play.
4763442	4771124	There's different resolution options for Marvel vs. Capcom 2, as well as menu button settings allows you to
4775104	4801043	Open those with a long press to avoid accidental inputs They also have new artwork that's available to view that And bonus tracks with remixes of classic songs by Capjams from the Capcom sound team So they have a theme from Captain America, theme of Cyclops, theme of Jim, and theme of Captain Commando that are remixed I kind of want to listen to that
4802633	4821913	so yeah, that's awesome and free if you have the game nice alright, DarkSakura so a couple of things actually both pinball related is that Barrels of Fun officially revealed their second pinball table, Dune they have a license for Dune
4823537	4846950	um they are going to sell 300 of the thousand limited uh directly to the public the rest is going through distributors um but yeah very very limited release of this they all have a uh two thousand dollar deposit they're going to be eleven thousand six hundred dollars um and then as far as the other pinball release Stern is doing uh King Kong
4848722	4875477	and looks like they are doing pro premium and 932 limited edition models with the lowest starting at $6,999 pinball is not a cheap hobby to get into fuck no it's not even if you start with old tables they're still going to set you back quite a bit so alright that is true
4876035	4881039	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things you can get that are going to be a little cheaper than pinball.
4881060	4882761	We'll start with the US and Loki.

4941005	4946027	Fatal Fury, City of the Wolves on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

5267903	5270363	Alright, busy week around the world for releases.
5270483	5278585	I guess there was something to that whole, it feels like a very busy week in games and we might have an Elder Scrolls Stealth drop that'll probably be worldwide so, you know, just...
5280702	5282663	Have fun, whatever it is you're going to be gaming with this week.
5283383	5290325	Believe it or not, that takes us to the closing segment of our show where we get to the listener roundtable where we take your questions.
5290445	5296787	If you have anything in chat, we can also take a quick phone call over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to join our green room.
5297647	5301988	And yeah, if any questions are in chat, we also open up our mailbag every week.
5302148	5305809	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com, but I'm guessing it's nothing but spam.
5308484	5309984	Yeah, right.
5310045	5325189	Now, I was laughing because earlier during the show, you might have caught me, those of you that are watching live on Twitch, might have caught me looking at my phone and giggling, and that's because Jamie was texting me with a screenshot of her me that she made in Pikmin Bloom.
5325369	5325989	Just there it is.
5327950	5331731	There's DarkSakura in Pikmin Bloom with her first two Pikmin.
5331751	5332231	That's right.
5332531	5333752	I'm putting you on blast.
5336169	5337571	How long did I resist, though?
5337651	5338152	I love it.
5338692	5339333	No, it's funny.
5339413	5339954	It's funny to me.
5339994	5342457	I figured it's worth checking out.
5342898	5344199	It's free, right?
5344279	5345100	Like, whatever.
5345240	5349486	They're only farming your location data to be able to sell to third parties.
5349526	5349926	That's all.
5349986	5350687	It's not a big deal.
5351148	5352189	Until you opt out of it.
5352429	5352570	Yeah.
5354708	5355368	and DarkSakura.com.
5370034	5399314	turn it off when you stop and then you can catch up on mushrooms and the other you haven't gotten there yet Jamie but as you get to level 5 and level 10 you unlock a couple other mechanisms in the game and you can kind of like do those before you go to bed or just like as your phone nags you during the day or something this is very you know you have to have it open like I can't run like no no no they have it has adventure sync which they had in Pokemon Go and all the other stuff runs in the background just runs in the background so that's fucking ridiculous yeah
5400936	5401277	What's that?
5402399	5403562	I said uninstalling right now.
5403922	5404123	What?
5404323	5404544	What?
5404624	5404824	Why?
5405891	5407933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5432694	5438217	But it will also stop you from tracing a line directly to your house by setting a privacy zone.
5438277	5439177	So just a tip for everybody.
5439197	5440438	Wait, can other people see my lines?
5440498	5440998	Yes, they can.
5441638	5442599	And you can see their lines.
5443079	5445300	So if you set a privacy zone, you won't be able to see lines.
5446581	5448742	You won't be able to see lines around your house.
5449722	5454384	You'll see ones that other people did, but you will not leave trails going past your house.
5454885	5455005	So...
5456458	5459640	Looking at chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
5460200	5465063	TigerClaw says, I don't think you guys mentioned this, but there's been some announcements at Star Wars Celebration Japan.
5465443	5469745	You're right, we didn't talk about this, but let me run over what TigerClaw says.
5470786	5473287	New Star Wars content during the month of May for Fortnite.
5474087	5480150	and a new Star Wars game got announced for Star Wars Zero Company is what it's called, which is basically Star Wars XCOM.
5480510	5484612	Yeah, I was seeing that stuff because Fortnite has the Darth Jar Jar in it.
5484652	5488094	I saw you guys talking about that on Discord and I thought that was really interesting.
5488154	5491896	I was like, okay, they're really trying to make Jar Jar cool now, aren't they?
5492196	5492776	Well, they have.
5492876	5494677	They're trying to erase the memory of 20 years ago.
5494697	5499920	He's in the new Lego Star Wars movie that's coming out on Disney Plus or Series X.
5500400	5527329	I think it's a series it's too much the Star Wars world is like twisted so you have a lot of these flip-flop characters and Darth Jar Jar is in that as well yep so yeah that's going to be interesting with that Fortnite collaboration and yeah it's going to I mean I feel like is it really going to bring more eyes to Fortnite already Fortnite is super fucking popular like it's just going to be more skins that people are going to buy in Fortnite so yeah um
5527449	5528931	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5548532	5553454	So it's a series of what they call preparatory briefs, and they were filed in February.
5554054	5563338	And Pocket Pair in these briefs are saying that Nintendo's patents and suits should not have been granted because other work has already used them in the past.
5563758	5571421	For example, there's one patent that Nintendo got that is about capturing characters by releasing monsters or capture balls.
5571781	5576043	But Craftopia, Pocket Pair argues, did the same thing.
5576063	5576903	Yeah.
5577043	5582747	And then let's see, also Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2, Pikmin 3 Deluxe.
5582807	5589873	They say they all allow players to release a monster or a capture item and fire in a direction by releasing a button.
5590513	5599340	So they're basically saying Nintendo should have never been granted these patents in the first place, which is, I mean, yeah, I actually kind of agree that like this is... I do agree.
5599600	5601362	This is not the place to be fighting this.
5602263	5617157	I still don't understand why the fight from Nintendo is not about the actual design of the trademarked Pokemon, but I'm not Nintendo and I'm also no legal expert and perhaps do not understand why they feel they would not win that case.
5617677	5618378	or whatever it is.
5618958	5620760	So it's very interesting.
5621340	5621520	Yeah.
5621781	5627165	Well, Jay Helensky in chat says, funny how they never held these patents until another game existed that infringed on them.
5627205	5628527	Yeah, that's also weird too.
5628607	5629047	Yeah, right?
5629087	5632810	That you can patent something after the fact and be like, oh, they were suing you.
5632830	5638755	It's like... That it wasn't a problem until... And again, I think the real problem is that the Pokemon...
5640997	5647819	The legally distinct Pokemon in the game are not legally distinct enough is really the problem.
5647859	5649819	I just don't understand why that's not the lawsuit.
5649879	5651520	But again, I'm not a legal expert.
5652420	5660162	But if you don't sue for that, then you kind of... That's the argument that you're making, so it's not a good one.
5660902	5666105	So I wonder, so they're basically going to try, it sounds to me, and get these patents disqualified, thrown out.
5666125	5667546	Because isn't that what happened?
5667606	5670768	Like, didn't somebody try to fucking patent podcasting?
5672129	5673670	And it was way after the fact.
5674010	5679073	And, you know, obviously all the big name podcasters at the time were coming out swinging against this.
5679133	5681094	And basically their patent got shredded.
5681574	5683996	That it should never have been granted in the first place.
5684736	5686597	So, oh, interesting.
5686817	5687258	Interesting.
5688308	5707370	and I think, I don't know I don't remember that one particularly but like something to the effect of like where I'll put it in perspective we're doing it to protect it so no one else does it the big name podcaster they started going after at the time was Adam Carolla
5708701	5710382	Whatever happened to that guy?
5710802	5715343	I remember Love Lines and the show they ended up with on MTV.
5715764	5718345	I know he kind of – well, he started a morning show or something.
5718365	5723907	I think he's more on the conservative end of things now, which is really interesting when you look at where Jimmy Kimmel's ended up.
5723947	5724847	It's kind of –
5725868	5727489	I think that's why they split, too.
5727810	5730112	Oh, probably, probably.
5730673	5731934	So, interesting.
5732855	5739702	Anyway, but Jimmy Kimmel also used to do that show with Ben Stein, who's also, a lot of people don't realize, Ben Stein's also pretty notorious.
5740043	5741865	Win Ben Stein's money, heck yeah!
5741965	5743667	Yeah, and Jimmy Kimmel was on that show, too.
5744808	5748052	So, like, if I could go on... Well, we're going to go on a tangent anyways.
5748092	5748493	Why not?
5748513	5749634	It's that part of the show.
5749734	5750015	Do it.
5750215	5756763	Yeah, it's so... There was a thing that I got introduced to this week.
5757064	5757645	It was...
5759724	5771770	by another fellow content creator by the name of Pixel Riffs, who introduced me to this relatively new show called Kaso.
5772450	5780014	And Kaso is a Japanese skateboarding TV show in the vein of Ninja Warrior.
5780894	5782075	Interesting Okay Interesting
5806976	5810298	Well, before we wrap it up for tonight, Loki, any last-minute stories to share with us tonight?
5811379	5811879	I looked.
5812320	5813621	I could not find any.
5814701	5815482	All right.
5815522	5817223	Possibly Asakotaku.
5817243	5817843	That's about it.
5817983	5818584	That's all I saw.
5819024	5819464	What was that?
5820438	5841988	possible layoffs at Kotaku again who's left over there well actually they don't even like you go to their site an old article no this is an old article so okay well I mean few that it's not new but also like there's been definitely a change in strategical direction over there because you go to the launch page it's not gaming news it's not 100 gaming news no it's another and that's the same with
5842068	5842328	Yeah.
5842348	5842709	Yeah.
5842769	5842969	Yeah.
5865411	5866852	We're not here to report the news.
5866892	5868032	We're here to comment on the news.
5868072	5870113	And I think there's a big difference between that.
5870213	5872394	So, you know, that's one thing you can sort of never replace.
5872734	5876115	But we're also we are also under no illusion that we're profiting off of this.
5876515	5880037	You guys have been generous enough with the biddies and the subs that we can afford to keep this running.
5880257	5882418	Like we're not paying out of our own pocket to do this.
5882638	5887920	Then that's that's really cool because there was a period of time when we were on shoutcast and all that we were paying out of pocket to do that.
5888460	5916873	and that's that's fine you know people pay for hobbies that they enjoy but Twitch has allowed us to monetize enough so that we can actually be we have all the legal types of protections and that sort of thing that that we need to keep us legitimate and all that so it's nice that we're not like paying out of pocket to do any of that and once in a while we get to sponsor a nice thing like I'm hoping we get to sponsor a nice little gaming conference coming up in like two months so we'll hopefully have more news on that in the coming weeks.
5917534	5918816	But you can all probably guess what it is.
5921040	5922343	Because it's in Bobby's neck of the woods.
5922383	5923565	That should be the biggest tune you need.
5925028	5925429	Let's see.
5926491	5928234	I forgot where I was going with that, but sure.
5929361	5930021	You were saying words.
5930542	5933183	I know, something about commentating versus news and all that.
5933323	5934984	Oh, the guides and all that stuff.
5935004	5943809	I was going to say, with social media, how many of you are getting your updates from, let's say, Kotaku, but I'm using that to symbolize a lot of gaming websites.
5947691	5957476	versus Wario 64 at this point and other those social media people that kind of keep it down to, you know, 300 characters.
5957496	5958576	What's the blue sky limit?
5958756	5959137	300 characters?
5959437	5961758	The people that take 300 characters or less.
5962745	5974589	Yeah, it's mainly those because I find sites like Kotaku and stuff like that, you'll get an article that's a summary of a social media post or a summary of a YouTube video that's been put up.
5974629	5982672	And there's so much garbage around it with the ads and the videos and the autoplays and the punchline is at the end and all that.
5982792	5984233	Funny enough, I missed the
5985353	5992419	The comments on the articles as well, because that was something at least you could see some pushback on things.
5992459	5998143	You would see like corrections on there about certain things or like people sharing their opinions and stuff.
5998183	6000285	And now there isn't that on there in any ways.
6000345	6005869	But yeah, I get a lot of my news, especially when it comes to gaming stuff from social media, because that's where...
6006269	6006829	Leaks first.
6035836	6037237	and it keeps us humble.
6037357	6037677	It's fine.
6037717	6048603	We don't know everything, but we're here to talk about it and have fun with it and be chatty at the dinner table after a round of gaming, playing DDR at the arcade for an hour.
6049724	6050024	Thank you.
6050044	6052306	PodCulture says, I get most of my news here on Sundays.
6052326	6053166	Well, I do appreciate that.
6053186	6056768	And I realize there are people that maybe don't follow all that social media stuff.
6056808	6060050	They don't need to inject gaming news into their veins every single day.
6060430	6061771	So they kind of get
6062011	6062532	Thank you for watching!
6082888	6086670	There's a few Nintendo blogs on Blue Sky that I follow, mostly Nintendo stuff, sure.
6086990	6089391	And TigerClaw echoes the gaming sites on social media.
6089531	6090892	Yeah, for sure.
6093433	6093993	Interesting.
6094473	6099375	S2100Matt says, turns out you can't profit off of making terrible headlines and rage bait stories.
6099496	6101456	Oh my god, what was the article I saw?
6101496	6108279	It had nothing to do with gaming, but I literally screamed at how bad this headline was.
6108319	6109680	Hold on, I want to see if I can find it.
6111254	6112094	I want to see if I can find it.
6112114	6122696	My favorite, though, is some of these sites that do have all these guides and things, and when you go to the next page, it jumps four weeks in the past, and there's no way to see anything that's fallen off of that first page.
6122757	6123797	That's another fun one.
6123937	6124677	Okay, here we go.
6124697	6124957	You're right.
6124977	6127277	This has nothing to do with gaming, I'm going to admit.
6127678	6130638	But tell me you don't see this same shit in the gaming sphere, okay?
6130758	6133859	This one hit my Google News feed.
6133939	6134739	Here's the headline.
6134759	6135059	You ready?
6135119	6137880	It's a headline from People magazine that says...
6138880	6152956	Bowen Yang says you know the actor right from Saturday Night Live Bowen Yang says he will leave Saturday Night Live at some point exclusive at some point exclusive
6154498	6157621	No shit.
6157661	6158241	No shit.
6158581	6160123	Are you fucking shitting me?
6160963	6170451	Somebody who has a finite amount of time on this earth may leave a television program no matter how long that program's been running at some point?
6171392	6172553	Sure.
6172953	6173934	Are you shitting me?
6173954	6174014	God.
6181505	6195114	Anyway, that's that's can you imagine like being a person working on a publication and bringing that to your editor and saying, here, I made a thing.
6195274	6197955	And your editor looks at that and goes, yep, let's print it.
6198036	6202739	Like, I mean, like, can you imagine like it's like, what is this conveying?
6203099	6204680	Well, that they may leave at some point.
6205120	6205921	Right, but that's everybody, right?
6205941	6206201	Exclusive.
6206241	6206661	Exclusive.
6236153	6237414	What a fucking joke!
6241217	6241558	That's right.
6242198	6244640	Okay, everybody, OLR exclusive.
6244800	6246462	I've got the OLR exclusive for you.
6246922	6251466	The PlayStation 6 will release at some point.
6251566	6252366	At some point.
6252787	6254388	Exclusive.
6254508	6255589	Here's your exclusive.
6256350	6257130	I will go to bed.
6258551	6259112	When you want.
6261280	6261781	in the future.
6262221	6262942	It's an exclusive.
6263482	6265124	Exclusive OLR headline.
6265144	6266825	I will be sleeping at some point.
6267165	6269007	Exclusive OLR headline.
6269808	6270849	I deserve a sweet treat.
6271569	6271870	Thank you.
6278720	6279060	Anyway.
6279340	6279641	All right.
6281462	6285525	Jay Helensky says space news will throw up at some point.
6285765	6289607	Space news has a huge habit of these kind of news stories as well.
6289647	6295391	Well, look, look what took up all the fucking air in the room in space news this week.
6296512	6303897	And it had to do with a certain singer and a certain talk show host best friend going up into space for 11 minutes.
6304861	6305941	And now they're astronauts.
6306281	6308042	And now they're astronauts.
6311583	6312843	Guys did all that training.
6312903	6316604	I mean, all I did was just buy a ticket and I went like, it can't be that hard.
6316804	6320745	Did you, by the way, the shade, the shade that was going around with that.
6320825	6324426	So you know that there was like, like Pop Crave or one of those things.
6324886	6326746	Rin Mari says Space Lounge Radio.
6327066	6329107	Fucking, I fucking love space.
6329407	6330627	It's actually like a nerdy...
6331547	6340711	I get all my news from the gas station, the pump TV that they have on there.
6340991	6346374	Pop Crave put this post up about Katy Perry went to space, you know, type of thing.
6346954	6351996	And Wendy's, the brand, the burger chain, replied, can we send her back?
6353077	6358899	To which, by the way, within three hours, Kesha the singer said,
6359073	6359774	and DarkSakura.com.
6381692	6388555	who she worked with and who Kesha once upon a time worked with and things got very, very, very ugly.
6388935	6394318	You know why that is some A-plus classmaster shade for Kesha to be drinking about a Wendy's cup.
6394598	6399520	But apparently the whole thing hurt Katy Perry's feelings.
6401421	6401861	Oh no.
6403321	6404222	I feel so bad.
6405888	6406368	and Wendy's.
6406388	6409269	Yeah, Tiger Class says they got a ton of backlash over it but didn't apologize.
6409309	6416252	Yeah, Wendy's said, well, we get spicy on Twitter sometimes just like our chicken nuggets which are available for $4.99.
6416352	6417372	I'm just kidding.
6417392	6421894	They didn't say that last half but you know an intern drafted it.
6422234	6423395	You know somebody drafted it.
6423455	6431938	Actually, we should stop saying social media interns because there's people that make a lot of money on social media and at Wendy's you know somebody's getting paid over there for this shit.
6432178	6434759	Like all that free advertising for Wendy's that Kesha just did.
6435279	6435780	Seriously.
6436941	6437401	Anyways.
6438702	6444688	Bobby says, I didn't realize Wendy's was still a spicy social media brand because all the smart people got off Twitter.
6445088	6450413	So we have to get all this news stuff secondhand because a lot of the brands, trademark, are still on Twitter.
6451214	6456458	But if rumor is to be believed on some code sourcing that was done on GitHub...
6457079	6460921	Blue Sky is about to roll out their version of verified accounts.
6461281	6462602	And no, you don't pay for it.
6462682	6463642	It's a different mechanism.
6464403	6469365	Next week, supposedly, based on things that are seen in the code, you know, again, take that with a huge grain of salt.
6469985	6474808	I would like to know when Blue Sky is rolling out pictures in the DMs and private accounts.
6475668	6479990	And I realize that takes time because it is all built on the backbone of the app protocol.
6480510	6482311	But, you know, time's a-tickin'.
6482471	6483072	Time's a-tickin'.
6484009	6485651	I'm so glad I fucking left that site.
6485791	6490094	I'm not deleting my account because I don't want anyone to, you know...
6504833	6505974	No, and I didn't either.
6506575	6509638	Believe me, I hate that website more than anybody else, but I don't want anyone taking my account.
6509819	6514984	And I have business cards in circulation that have it, but I just have a big message that says, she gone, girl.
6515305	6518809	And it has a link to my new socials and all that stuff.
6519189	6521051	But I took the app off my phone
6521812	6522632	J. Helensky
6542342	6549450	I want it to be an opt-in thing, just saying, because I don't want nasty pictures sent to me.
6550691	6551713	I believe it is.
6552193	6555076	DMs in general are an opt-in thing.
6555116	6555957	You can turn it off.
6556138	6558340	I think right now you can have it be set to private.
6558500	6559762	I want to keep my DMs.
6560002	6563446	I want to be able to opt-in whether or not someone can send me a fucking picture.
6564286	6565887	Well, we'll see when they actually roll it out.
6565927	6571049	But they have been pretty good about actually opt-in because, again, a billionaire doesn't own Blue Sky right now.
6571069	6573450	There's no shareholder involvement in Blue Sky right now.
6573590	6576051	So a world without Caesars, all of that.
6577291	6577592	Let's see.
6577852	6579292	But y'all had some other good comments.
6579432	6581833	Oh, where was the part about – here it is.
6582193	6587856	Bobby Blackwolf talking about the brands on Blue Sky saying, well, the brands got bullied off of Blue Sky by Adobe.
6588496	6599179	Oh yeah, that was... Adobe made some bleat and everybody just dogpiled on him about subscription fees and AI and the forced opt-in and all that stuff.
6599539	6601580	Every grievance people had with Adobe came out.
6602040	6605221	So yeah, very interesting.
6606121	6611322	Well, maybe don't be shitty and people won't treat you that way.
6611543	6612503	Yeah, so...
6613610	6615992	Anyway, let's see.
6616052	6618373	Yeah, it was pretty ugly.
6618974	6620515	Anyway, that's it.
6620635	6622716	We've had enough off-topic chatter.
6622756	6623977	Let's wrap things up for the night.
6624557	6626298	Thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
6626318	6630081	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.
6630101	6635484	Tell a friend or two about our show, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6635544	6637045	So tell a friend or two about the show.
6637545	6642749	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show.
6643209	6646450	All of that goes an awful long way, and we really appreciate it.
6647311	6652212	That all being said, DarkSakura, I think you said you're doing some streaming tonight, so we'll let you go.
6652552	6654073	Any last thoughts on your way out?
6655994	6657234	Oh, Lord, I'm in for it.
6658214	6658575	All right.
6659035	6659975	I'm in for it.
6660875	6664477	And, yeah, I hurt, too, so we'll see how long this goes.
6664777	6666738	I will feel better.
6668038	6670439	All right, Loki, that takes us over to you and your final thought for tonight.
6672440	6676422	My final thought is now I'm only a week away from jury duty.
6677162	6678262	I'm not happy about that.
6678282	6678942	You poor soul.
6679343	6681663	Hopefully it's a quick two-day trial.
6682784	6683784	Hopefully.
6685264	6692007	My final thought for tonight is I'm going to see Kylie Minogue on Tuesday in San Francisco, and I'm so excited because I love her.
6693267	6697708	Yes, I know she's playing all the DDR bops, but lots of good stuff from her catalog.
6697768	6699189	I've actually never seen her live.
6700849	6704772	After all these chances I've had and I've just missed because sometimes I'm a bump on a log.
6705152	6706933	So this time I said I'm not going to miss it.
6707053	6708553	So I can't wait for that.
6708674	6711375	So I just can't get that out of my head.
6712335	6714877	All right.
6714957	6716378	On that note, we'll see you in seven days.
6717058	6718959	Good luck with the Switch pre-order Hunger Games.
6719359	6722141	May the odds ever be in your favor on those Switch 2s.
6722181	6722821	Good luck, everybody.
6722921	6725082	We'll see how it went for everybody next week.
6725222	6726363	Until then, have a good night.
6726463	6726623	Bye.
