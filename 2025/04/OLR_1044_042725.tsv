10145	10565	We'll be right back.
40046	43189	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
43209	47233	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47333	49836	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49876	56122	We're here and live once again with episode number 1044 of our show for tonight, April the 27th of 2025.
56222	57864	Last show of April, if you can believe it.
62748	62928	No.
62988	63088	No.
85542	86243	No, I shouldn't be
115002	119265	We have been nicknaming him as a sexy man.
120546	122267	Fun fact, he is tied to video games.
122307	127911	He's the voice of Grahatia in Final Fantasy XIV and still does it, even with all his other commitments, which is amazing.
129031	129311	Indeed.
130713	137238	But I also am going through physical therapy, so I have been doing physical therapy exercises this morning.
138239	147027	And yeah, I found out for my leg, while, yes, I had sprained my quad, I tore my hamstring.
148968	149389	Not bad.
149429	158113	I mean, clearly the muscle isn't collapsed or anything, but it's enough that it hurts.
159054	161755	So I've been doing physical therapy this morning as well.
161795	162656	Then I went to dance.
163236	164457	I have dance tomorrow night.
166098	170880	I have physical therapy all week, and then I have dance on Wednesday.
171921	174723	I'm literally now that person that says, I'm sorry, I can't.
174763	175243	I have dance.
175734	181422	Just dance, it'll be okay Anyone?
181502	188833	Alright It feels great though, I mean I'm sore afterwards, but I feel like
190738	195503	This is where I start getting the improvement that I wanted to get in ballet.
195984	198466	And I feel like I might be on my way to my goals.
198626	205313	But I did... Character shoes are terrible in a story.
205414	205674	For sure.
205894	209375	I actually feel a little bit similar to your journey, but with walking.
209435	220580	I mean, I know it's not as intense, but I've been really like even my little Apple Health summary thing because, you know, I wear the watch and stuff tells me like you've been getting more exercise these last few weeks and you haven't a long time.
220900	222541	Your heart rate has been recovering better.
222581	224942	And it's like, yeah, because I've been like walking like all the time.
225462	227044	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
245586	248568	They should really be paying me with as much as I promote this game, but they don't.
249949	252531	Next month they're doing classic console Pikmin.
252891	257554	So all the Pikmin that you hatch from special seedlings will be like NES classic Nintendo.
257574	260296	There's a little pink one you can see with a Game & Watch themed.
260336	262617	And I was like, well, this is the one where they convinced me to spend my money.
262637	263418	They don't have to actually use it.
265469	268510	No, you don't have to actually play the games on them.
268590	270490	They're just little decorative things.
270650	271790	So they really don't mean anything.
271810	273590	I haven't even opened the app since last week.
274411	275671	Oh, bummer.
276451	280152	So I guess we'll see if I do.
281692	292794	I can say, though, that just dancing today was about for an hour of dance, about 2,500 steps.
294127	294369	Nice.
294389	295374	That's good.
295937	298149	Counting all my jumping and spinning and turning about?
298883	300144	That's the most ridiculous thing ever
327307	332096	It evolves into slightly bluer than the normal ones.
332116	333037	It's kind of weird, but anyway.
334961	335963	That's ridiculous.
336805	352656	Going back to our chat, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except there was no Bobby Blackwolf tonight, so if you missed Bobby, he actually was not on this week.
352716	362162	He had a prior commitment and was unable to do tonight's show, but he will be back next week, and we'll look forward to seeing you an hour before us at 8 o'clock Eastern next week.
362803	365544	S2100 Matt says, purple ice cream, ube ice cream.
366365	372308	Fuck, have you ever had... I don't eat ice cream a lot anymore because, you know, of all my health stuff, but like... Ube, all the things.
372408	379191	Ube, frozen yogurt, fro-yo, like which I still shouldn't eat because like LOL sugar, but once in a while as a treat.
379611	381332	Oh my God, so good.
382053	387795	Like seriously, I get excited when I see that flavor because, you know, you can never figure out what fucking flavor a yogurt store will have.
388096	391677	But when I see Ube, I'm like, oh, this is it.
393038	393518	This is it.
394819	396241	You know what, though?
396941	406448	I would have to say of my favorite, I guess, non-traditional Western flavors, you put black sesame in front of me and I lose my shit.
406668	407049	It's great.
408391	413833	All right, I also want to put a pin in this comment from PodCulture in chat talking about us.
413893	415894	We were talking about Wicked and Jonathan Bailey.
416274	419716	PodCulture said, Rob, but all the books he mauled in that number.
420576	426498	You know, yeah, the way they do things in the movies is sometimes different from the books, is sometimes different from the stage show.
426839	427579	And I think that's great.
427599	428339	They all can be different.
428759	434802	I want to put a pin in that because I want to come back to that because there's a lot, you know, we talk about not just gaming news, but like what gamers are talking about online online.
435322	437543	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
463553	465074	I did for a little bit.
465654	468655	Not to get too far into my gaming week, but oops.
469355	470235	How do I explain it?
470395	475737	It is really that they put the same fucking thing, the exact same thing you remember.
476117	476857	Bugs and all.
476917	487261	And if you've been looking at the TikToks or the Instagram reels or your short form video thing of choice, you've probably been seeing here's the bug in the original game and here's the scroll in Remastered.
487761	491642	And it's weird because as much as people bitch and moan about Bethesda and their bugs...
492222	504913	This time it is strangely endearing because it is everything you remember wrapped in completely new, shiny, sparkling, beautiful, somehow four-dimensional wrapping paper.
505373	507615	Because it's really mind-blowing graphics.
507755	509037	The graphics really are good.
509277	512419	I played the opening segment where you escape the dungeon.
512459	513460	I think everybody knows by now.
513721	516183	Patrick Stewart's Real Septim character is there.
516663	518505	And I noticed right away...
519065	520165	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
549909	551610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
572780	579244	I wonder if they got delayed from like something like it was supposed to come out like at their last announcement thing that they did.
579504	581685	But I think they would have said something.
581945	582305	Yeah.
582606	582806	Yeah.
583426	597414	And, you know, I joked on last week's show that this was going to be a big week for games because you have Elder Scrolls, you know, Oblivion remaster and then Claire Obscure Expedition 33 also on Game Pass.
597714	598274	Oblivion Square Enix
618140	618541	and DarkSakura.
634902	641968	That's basically what I'm hearing about it from the internet, which I'm curious if any of you have played it in your thoughts in chat.
642868	645330	I downloaded it, and that's about as far as I got.
645390	645831	Yeah, yeah.
645851	647292	I haven't installed and all that good stuff.
647992	659341	I chose to play Oblivion Remaster instead just because I was like, well, I probably won't play that one start to finish, but Claire Obscure I'll definitely want to sink into, and I want to make sure I have a bulk amount of time there.
659361	660101	Yeah.
661022	666286	TigerClaw in chat talking about the Oblivion remaster saying, "...that Oblivion remaster won't be the last.
666446	669067	Expect re-releases of this game for the years to come.
669388	672790	It'll come out on every platform known to man, every version imaginable."
672930	673730	I don't disagree.
673870	677773	I think a Switch 2 version is all but a certainty for this.
678674	684858	Assuming it will run, because it doesn't run on PlayStation 4 or the last series of Xbox...
685538	691765	So I don't know, maybe Switch 2 isn't a guarantee, but if it can run it, I would say it would definitely happen.
692526	705061	I would assume, I know this sounds wacky, but y'all have to be thinking, I would assume they're going to do a Skyrim, which they've already done, but I think they're going to do a Skyrim in Unreal 5, I really do.
707411	711372	Yeah, that or like I would even see like a Fallout before that.
712352	714673	Ooh, that's actually a really good call out.
714873	719394	I would say especially if they could time the Fallout to go with the series that's on TV.
720114	720694	Absolutely.
721774	726095	SS2100 Matt in chat says Todd Howard slightly smirking at the thought of a new Skyrim.
726735	729356	Tiger Claw pointing out and lots of mods too.
729736	731696	Oh yeah, the mods are already coming out for this game.
731796	733937	Some of them very controversial because...
734597	735058	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
752373	753333	I want to talk about The Last of Us.
771460	774762	I am going to spoil some things that happened in the second game.
775262	777044	That game is five years old at this point.
777264	781466	My assumption is if you're a gamer and you care about that series, you have played it at this point.
781807	790252	So I apologize if I'm going to spoil a major plot point because it has to do with the TV show.
790712	794598	So if you do not want to be spoiled, I would encourage you to lower the volume for about three minutes.
794718	798463	I will give you a hand signal on Twitch when I'm done.
798904	802089	For those of you on the podcast, you'll need to fast forward about three minutes.
802129	803291	Give me a minute to do this, okay?
803851	804452	All right, here I go.
804472	805273	So I'm going to spoil this.
806488	811811	So this week on The Last of Us on Max was the episode where Joel dies.
812551	819815	And I was really surprised that they did that early on in the show because I thought they would milk this entire season with Pedro Pascal.
820215	823977	And then maybe like that would be the big cliffhanger at the end and they would do something different next season.
824017	825838	Like next season would be Abby's point of view.
826298	827039	or whatever it is.
827119	829802	But no, they spoiled it on the TV or spoiled it.
829842	835629	They showed that sequence on the TV show this week which would be similar to the events early on in the game.
835869	839493	This happens early on in the game to really like change up the tone.
839814	840634	But here's the thing.
841315	845097	In the TV show, they told you Abby's motivations.
845517	850819	They basically, you know, Abby comes out and says, it's something I haven't watched the show yet.
850879	852820	I'm getting all of this fed through TikTok.
853140	853700	And which is great.
854320	862924	It's like the new Red Wedding because it's people reacting to the death who have not played the games and are freaking the fuck out.
863284	867966	And everybody's like, finally, gamers have their Game of Thrones Red Wedding moment.
868286	869107	It's supposed to show, not say
890786	891147	Exactly.
891647	897929	And so in the games, you don't find out Abby's motivations for like 10 more hours in the game.
898229	907693	And that's actually a big, if you remember, people did not care for The Last of Us Part 2 because they hated Abby and you were forced to play as Abby for as long as the game.
908113	909394	And then you found out.
910215	916860	Oh, Abby is somebody's daughter of somebody who was killed in the first game by Joel, and it's a cycle of revenge.
917161	919363	But basically, she set her motivation out the gate.
919743	929492	And an interesting online theory is that they did not want the actress to put up with the same bullshit that the actress who played Abby had to put up with in the games.
929772	936358	Because again, 2020, pandemic lockdowns, people were going through it online, and obviously...
937390	939632	And that game is traumatic anyway.
961508	963108	to get around that controversy.
963529	969650	I'm fine with the show doing its own narrative because also it's only two episodes in.
969690	971331	We have a whole season left to go.
971891	974452	We don't know ultimately what this payoff may be.
974512	979573	We know there are other characters now in the show that are not in the games and all this other stuff.
980533	987155	And I don't know how the show is going to give that same experience of playing the game from Abby's point of view and all that.
987515	988676	I don't know how that's going to go.
989656	995699	So it's weird, but even though I don't really watch the show, this whole thing has made me want to watch it.
996240	1000021	I'm like, clearly this show is really fucking good.
1000842	1011107	I knew that after the first season, but clearly this show... I need to make time because clearly this show, if it is inciting all of these opinions in the reaction video, clearly I need to be watching it.
1012068	1013268	Because it's... yeah.
1013889	1015870	But, I mean, there's an example of...
1016872	1022854	A different version of the property doing something completely different for its own artistic reasons.
1024094	1026474	TigerClaw says Pedro Pascal was the show's biggest draw.
1026815	1027955	Are they going to stick around after?
1028795	1038678	I understand that Pedro Pascal is still in the season, and it's probably through flashbacks, and we know that the show has done deeper dives on topics that weren't covered in the games.
1039218	1043979	So Pedro Pascal will still be in the show, but I would expect that he's not in season three.
1045200	1050004	So the show will have to, you know, but I don't know what they're going to do with season three now.
1050024	1051786	It really feels like they're covering the events of the second game.
1052086	1056650	So do they do the Game of Thrones thing and just kind of like go the direction they think the games are going in?
1056710	1058652	Or do they allow the creative license?
1058672	1060114	Is there a third game coming out?
1061855	1063317	We maybe will find that out summer.
1065483	1081054	I could see that a third game is announced summer comes out for holiday and then they're safe to translate that into a show next year but I think there's that very real possibility it's the Game of Thrones thing we all know he's never finishing the books we all know he is never finishing the books so yeah he is
1083257	1085679	from the great beyond if he doesn't step on it.
1087040	1094625	But you'll have to channel it for somebody to write on stone tablets if he doesn't fucking hurry it up.
1096306	1100529	But they had the outline or whatever to do the show off of, so it'll be interesting.
1100729	1101669	Anyway, all right.
1102070	1104471	Some people that may have muted this want us to move on.
1104591	1106753	We have other topics to get into, so there's my signal.
1107093	1111276	It's safe to listen again, although all of you in chat were spoiling it anyway, so whatever.
1111356	1113037	But again, the game is five years old.
1113497	1118480	Like, I feel if you're very passionate about it, you probably have figured it out at this point.
1118700	1120101	Okay, and you had a week on the show.
1120681	1122602	Okay, let's move on.
1122622	1125044	I want to get into other kickoff topics for tonight.
1125124	1131007	And obviously the big thing going on in the gaming world has to do with the Switch 2 pre-orders.
1131448	1134389	They happened this last week, for better or for worse.
1134890	1137191	Some people, I think, had some mixed experiences.
1138432	1140573	Jamie, I'm pretty sure you didn't try for one.
1140613	1141714	You kind of made your...
1142614	1143835	I'm not really interested right now.
1144055	1145175	Yeah.
1145676	1148337	But Loki, I saw a bleep from you on Blue Sky.
1148617	1149738	You did try for this, right?
1149778	1152079	How did that experience go for you with the preordering of Switch 2?
1153580	1157522	It was messy because like there was a lot of this.
1157722	1160444	I mean, obviously we expected the sites and everything to like
1161517	1162377	DarkSakura,
1181863	1202567	you'd be able to get it into the cart and you'd be able to like put all your payment information in all that stuff and you hit go and then it's like oh sold out it's like okay but it's in the cart you can't you know how's it selling out already um and then I managed to get everything finally the process to a certain point and then they wiped all the carts
1203703	1206986	So at that point, I was like, okay, well, this sucks.
1207106	1212170	I'm just going to try through Walmart and Best Buy.
1212210	1215053	So Best Buy puts you in a queue that you have to wait.
1215834	1215954	And...
1217492	1243927	I just it just waited it never did anything beyond that Walmart was a little crazier too same thing where essentially you could put it in the cart hit you know process pay or whatever and they would just error out and they kept doing that back and forth and they would say one sold out one's in stock the bundles sold out the individuals in stock finally went back to Target again because it's like oh hey there's more available now and I finally managed to
1244861	1250705	I put it in the cart on my PC and I was able to process the transaction on the app on my phone.
1252186	1257349	So I did finally get one, but it was such a hassle.
1257429	1261732	It took like two hours when I was like right there at the start.
1261772	1262513	Like it wasn't there.
1262553	1264794	Like I got in a couple minutes late.
1264854	1266536	No, I was there to the second.
1266556	1266736	Yeah.
1267887	1269467	Yeah, that was my mistake with Target.
1269487	1271848	Target had my wrong address.
1295171	1300693	Yeah, so you make sure all that stuff's ready to go prior to actually launching.
1300773	1303814	That should help with some of that stuff because it was a mess.
1304175	1305135	It was all over the place.
1305275	1307936	But yeah, finally, I did get one.
1308196	1313338	And I did see that some people did manage to get one earlier on the night, but then had their orders canceled.
1313418	1315179	Thankfully, mine has not been canceled.
1315219	1315479	So I'm
1317472	1322375	Pretty safe now that it's about, you know, a week out that probably not going to cancel it, you know.
1323216	1330360	But that's the other thing, too, with the Walmart or the Target or one of those, that estimated delivery date kept getting pushed out, out, out, out.
1330440	1339766	So, you know, that's one of the things I know that we're going to be talking about is that, you know, Nintendo's like, well, we can't promise that you're going to have your console day one type thing.
1340866	1341447	I don't know.
1341827	1342807	Honestly, don't really care.
1343268	1344068	It could be the first week.
1344108	1344608	It doesn't matter.
1344628	1345269	Yeah.
1347028	1349089	But I'm just glad I was able to get one.
1349869	1355671	I feel like my story is a little bit less dramatic just because I was able to get through on Best Buy.
1355691	1361833	So the biggest problem with Best Buy is that it didn't go live right at 9 for us on the West Coast.
1361893	1362794	It didn't go live right at 9.
1363774	1366795	It didn't go live until like 9.24 or something like that.
1366855	1370076	It was at least a good 20 minutes after the fact that it finally went live.
1370176	1374618	You're just kind of sitting there reloading and then all of a sudden the button's available and then the button puts you in another queue.
1375700	1376741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1397675	1400396	All things considered, it ended up being pretty low drama for me.
1400476	1403537	Now, other people, my understanding is it was not low drama.
1403637	1407358	I was watching on our Discord over at vognetwork.com.
1407398	1408358	People were sharing stories.
1408978	1412479	And at some point, the Best Buy queue kicked a bunch of people out.
1412739	1414400	Because I know Bobby got kicked out, which...
1415160	1415240	Yeah.
1415300	1415520	Yeah.
1436396	1437317	This is the weird thing.
1437577	1441978	I actually feel like all things considered, it went better than I expected it to.
1442498	1445920	And I know that sounds especially fucked up if you're one of the people out there that didn't get one.
1445960	1446840	And I'm very sorry.
1447040	1448761	And, you know, the system's being screwy.
1449141	1453423	Like, everybody's always like, the retailers need to put more power into it.
1453443	1454543	They need to put more power into it.
1454583	1463927	But it's like, it's kind of like the reality is it's not that easy where they can just turn the graphics up on level three or bring in the extra servers for one night type of thing.
1463947	1464667	Yeah.
1465587	1466828	They're never going to get this right.
1467008	1467569	Never, ever.
1467669	1471251	The only real solution is for this to be available at more retailers.
1471371	1475354	I'm kind of surprised Amazon wasn't one of the retailers.
1475815	1479617	But at the same time, I guess, you know, Amazon, Nintendo have history or whatever.
1479998	1480558	It is what it is.
1480598	1484101	Yeah, Rinmari in chat says, any high demand thing will be like this always.
1484181	1484761	Yeah, that's it.
1485081	1487963	OSG100Matt was also one of the people that got kicked out when Bobby got kicked out.
1488003	1489705	So a bunch of people got kicked out at some point, which is...
1490225	1518480	You know, annoying So yeah, it's just That's what it is And then apparently the GameStop thing For people that did that went pretty well Because that ended up being the next day So you had people that went in store And I know Shane was sharing his experience with me Because he was the only one I knew that went And he said they had like Between the two types of consoles Between the bundle and the non-bundle They had like 80 consoles to pre-order And there were only like 30 people in line
1519565	1526250	So, sounds like a lot of the GameStop people, I don't know, but again, he's in a very rural kind of area.
1526710	1532074	I don't know how those of you like in the Bay Area where tech is very popular, I don't know, the stories are probably very different.
1533555	1535016	But, yeah.
1536536	1539517	So anyway, it sounds like, you know, again, I was expecting it to be a lot worse.
1539737	1546400	I was expecting it to be like NES Classic or, you know, other types of Nintendo scarce things to be bad.
1547360	1548741	So I feel like it went better.
1548861	1550281	Oh, this is the other interesting thing.
1550421	1553983	So Alan pre-ordered one as well because he kind of wants one.
1554023	1555363	He's like, you know, yeah, I want a Switch 2.
1555703	1556504	Can we both get one?
1556564	1557824	I was like, all right, sure, why not?
1558524	1558764	So...
1561405	1565886	He was not able to get it because I think the credit card on Walmart or something was not working.
1566227	1568027	We recently switched bank accounts.
1568767	1575429	And so every time we were trying to process, it would come as a text message going, is this really you?
1575969	1578110	Please, that even happened to me the first time on Best Buy.
1578150	1583891	Thank God Best Buy held it for an extra 10 minutes while I could reply, yes, verify or whatever, and then get that through.
1584491	1587292	But the interesting thing with Alan, he was not able to get one.
1587972	1591994	Wednesday night, and then it was like, all right, well, whatever, you know, at least we got one.
1592694	1595256	But he got one last night through Walmart.
1595336	1602239	I guess the news came out on social media or somewhere that Walmart suddenly had extras in stock.
1602379	1607922	And we think the speculation is it's people who canceled or did something.
1607962	1609383	What, you want to tell the story, Alan?
1609403	1609483	Yeah.
1610362	1611322	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1628655	1642516	with Target, it wouldn't save my shipping address and then because it's like, oh, you've never ordered from us before and I made sure the credit card number obviously was saved beforehand because why would I raw dog it with my hand?
1643692	1659343	and when it finally popped up and said verify your credit card number I put in the CVV2 on the back of the card because that's normally what you have to do for verification but no it was asking for the whole number so I put in the CVV2 and it gave Rob a fraud notification
1660512	1664275	and I realized, oh, it was literally asking for all 16 digits over again.
1664535	1666336	That was my shot on Target.
1666436	1667097	So I blew it.
1667217	1669018	That was the one time I went through.
1670359	1670639	It's fine.
1670659	1672160	We're not supposed to be shopping at Target anyway.
1672220	1672921	Yeah, I know.
1672941	1677224	There's no ethical, basically Best Buy except I'm sure they do something shady.
1677364	1677664	Anyway.
1678064	1678225	Yeah.
1679130	1680611	The rumor was... So I gave up.
1680631	1683073	Because once Rob... I was mostly the backup for Rob.
1683753	1686475	If Rob didn't get his at Best Buy, I was supposed to get one.
1686695	1688436	That way he could get what he wants.
1688616	1689817	Because that's always the most important thing.
1689837	1690698	So...
1693843	1699786	It was CheapAssGamer on BlueSky said, Walmart's doing checkouts right now.
1699966	1701327	The cart works in Walmart.
1701527	1703088	And I saw that on BlueSky.
1703108	1703748	I said, oh shit.
1704148	1705889	I used the app because the app is quicker.
1706509	1707250	And it went right through.
1707270	1709671	Add to cart, credit card, got a receipt.
1710526	1713387	So it's probably all the people whose credit cards declined.
1714267	1716248	You stole one of their Switch 2s.
1716268	1716508	Good job.
1735475	1749450	and I guess I snagged one of those and I told a friend in Chicago and all he did was click the add to cart once and it said this is a high ticket item so we're busy right now and he gave up and if you kept doing it
1750495	1750595	Yeah.
1750635	1750815	Yeah.
1750835	1750955	Yeah.
1750975	1751056	Yeah.
1775782	1779687	Alright, well thank you for sharing the story, Alan, how that happened, because I wasn't home when that all went down.
1779787	1782370	I heard about this all through text message, so yeah.
1783191	1783451	Anyway.
1783811	1785073	Alright, thank you for the Alan cameo.
1785133	1785653	We appreciate it.
1785753	1785954	Have fun.
1787335	1790437	All right, so yeah, that was my Switch 2 experience.
1790677	1797021	So, Loki, you have some kind of like follow-ups to this whole, you know, what was going on online.
1797061	1801044	Yeah, I mean, it's not anything too shocking.
1801124	1803485	So, hey, guess what?
1803525	1805687	People are selling their pre-orders on eBay.
1806147	1809869	That's a thing already, of course, because Scalper's gonna scalp.
1809929	1811510	Well, okay, I'm gonna be honest.
1812130	1820895	Until I realized Alan actually wanted to switch two for himself, we did kind of get, we were like, well, if we end up with two, we could always resell one.
1821055	1826998	But I always would have, and I swear, I always would have, if a friend of mine needed it, I would have flipped it for the sticker price.
1827158	1833261	I would have turned it over to a friend first, but then if no friends wanted it, I would have been like, well, maybe I'll be a bitch.
1833722	1834142	We'll see.
1835782	1840826	Yeah, so there's that.
1841667	1856881	The other thing, too, is Nintendo has updated the website about pre-ordering a Switch 2 console, saying that there's very high demand and that they're not guaranteeing that all consoles will be delivered by the June 5th launch date.
1857421	1865345	This is, I think, on the actual Nintendo website with that whole invite process, which I still haven't gotten an email on, so I don't know if that's still a thing or not.
1883795	1884535	You know, with very few.
1884595	1891177	So I feel like there's not going to be a ton of people left for that Nintendo wave, but I guess maybe that's where the scalpers fuck everything up.
1891217	1891537	Who knows?
1892658	1892958	Yeah.
1893038	1899420	So, you know, obviously they're just kind of trying to like set the expectations that, hey,
1900563	1901564	There's high demand on this.
1901804	1906466	It's either going to deliver late or there may not have enough.
1906707	1913771	They're saying that we've received an extremely large number of applications, approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone.
1914271	1922415	However, this number far exceeds our expectations and far exceeds the number of Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo store on June 5th.
1923830	1947991	um they said we expect that a significant number of customers will be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow uh which would have been three days ago so i don't know if everybody heard on my nintendo who's going to get a console or not but that apparently already happened um we'll see i don't know it's hard to say um
1949704	1955846	And then... I mean, this always happens, so I'm not surprised.
1956446	1964069	GameStop is accused of forcing customers to buy bundles.
1964929	1968170	I mean, it wasn't that long ago that I remember the Switch 1.
1968210	1970371	I've heard of these shenanigans happen before, yeah.
1971131	1974632	It happens almost every console launch, that they are...
1976175	1977678	And I get it, and I get it.
1978500	1980283	This is not GameStop policy.
1980463	1985012	Overwhelmingly, customers had a positive experience, according to GameStop.
1987402	1988704	There's a lot of factors here.
1988824	2000336	So one, if it's in store, we don't know what the employees are being incentivized on or what is being said there because it could be a whole toothpaste thing.
2000597	2002439	If it's online, we've seen this before.
2002659	2005482	They've done this forced bundle stuff with the Xbox 360 and stuff.
2006423	2016669	Granted, they're not making any sort of margin on these consoles at all, probably losing some money, so it makes sense from a business perspective to do this, but it still sucks.
2019171	2019551	I don't know.
2019611	2031418	I think there's a lot of people, a lot of people that, even though they don't buy it as a bundle, they buy the Mario Kart version and say, and then they're like, okay, you know what, while I'm here, I'm going to get a camera and I'm going to get a pro controller.
2033019	2034620	When it's forced on them, they don't like that.
2035200	2036121	What are you not getting?
2036161	2041566	No, I'm not getting is the friggin' $85 official Nintendo carrying case for it.
2042027	2043408	$85 for a carrying case?
2043448	2045150	That's pretty, yeah, that's pretty ice.
2045170	2051316	Like, I get it, the stuff that, you know, has electronics in it, and that being expensive, but something that is essentially fabric...
2053272	2054333	What am I paying for?
2054893	2056915	It's not that much of a premium item.
2057495	2060037	The Steam Deck comes with one, just heads up.
2060077	2061718	And it's a nice, solid carrying case.
2062079	2062579	And I get it.
2062619	2067863	That $85 carrying case is one that can hold the actual dock and everything as well.
2069044	2069704	I mean, big deal.
2070325	2072266	They have another one that is half the price.
2072286	2073287	That's still $40.
2073327	2076309	That's still twice as much as the third-party cases.
2078331	2079672	I don't get it.
2079932	2081033	$85 seems awfully high.
2081753	2082394	But, you know...
2084005	2085466	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2108644	2137668	were able to, except of course there's just a few people that didn't so of course I feel bad for those folks but I'm hoping that Nintendo wave will sort of fill in the rest of the folks that still really want one and even the people that missed the first go around so that's the hope so we'll see but it definitely seems like Nintendo has more product out there than they have with other consoles previously so it's come a long way from the days of camping out for a Nintendo Wii and Jamie bribing her way to the front of the line with Krispy Kreme and being recognized from the internet
2139673	2163496	there's that all right that'll never happen anymore us no not anymore no it was it was different in 2006 when like podcasts were still like a very new thing and very few people did them and that people thought it was a very cost prohibitive thing it was very different you know no there was a I'm sure I've told this story on the show before or Jamie both um some guy in line some guy in line was listening to our show while waiting in line
2164901	2165802	Oh my god, it's you!
2176277	2177598	Yeah, that happened to us once.
2177878	2178418	It's me.
2178859	2182701	Jamie and I were at an arcade together and a person working there recognized us by our voice.
2183541	2191426	I got invited to a DDR tournament in Metairie when it turned out I was going to be going to Alabama.
2191686	2192707	So I ended up going.
2192727	2193207	Yeah.
2193787	2195608	Which, yeah, that would never happen anymore.
2195829	2196389	Never.
2197890	2198770	You'd be surprised.
2198890	2200111	It could happen.
2200151	2200812	I guess it could.
2200872	2201132	It could.
2201652	2202593	But it would not.
2202893	2202973	Yeah.
2202993	2203113	Yeah.
2203931	2209553	No, now, especially locally, once in a blue moon, it will be, why do you look familiar?
2209573	2211594	And I'll be like, have you ever seen a show at the Colonial?
2212334	2212514	Oh!
2213975	2215336	So once in a while, once in a while.
2216036	2216356	All right.
2217937	2218277	Hey, Brad.
2218697	2219077	Yeah, right.
2219397	2220618	Sorry, I couldn't help it.
2220658	2221658	That's a Rocky.
2221738	2222739	Not pod culture, Brad.
2222779	2223719	It's a Rocky thing.
2225340	2225720	Let's see.
2227288	2229690	The Gorilla72 in chat says, I felt bad.
2229830	2231591	I didn't really want one and got one.
2231771	2232192	LOL.
2232412	2233753	Eh, don't feel bad.
2233873	2235034	I mean, like, you know.
2235054	2235754	Just give it to me.
2235975	2237476	Yeah, give it to somebody who wants one.
2237636	2243740	Or, you know, if you do have a friend that maybe was really trying for one that couldn't get one, you could really be a lifesaver.
2244040	2248424	But also at the end of the day, maybe you'll get it and you'll be like, eh, I do kind of want one of these, you know.
2249184	2249524	Who knows?
2250685	2251585	You could be a hero.
2251765	2256308	DJ Ranma S says, Rob, don't forget that one time at KatsuCon where that vendor said, you're Rob Roberts from Originals Radio.
2256348	2257789	Yeah, it happens once in a while.
2257909	2260370	It's random.
2260931	2261331	It's random.
2261511	2262672	John's Incredible Pizza?
2262772	2263192	That was it.
2263272	2264172	That was the one I was talking about.
2264212	2265793	Yeah, when we were at the pizza place.
2265973	2266134	Yeah.
2268039	2270780	But that happened while we were doing it in line.
2271021	2271381	Yeah.
2271501	2272081	That was the thing.
2272101	2273762	I think you and I were bickering in line.
2273782	2279024	When I say bickering, I mean like Rose and Blanche on the Golden Girls, not like actual bickering.
2280885	2283026	It's like sibling stuff.
2284227	2284927	Anyway, all right.
2285427	2290590	We're going to get into our gaming week and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of games that you've been playing this week.
2290930	2295192	But as we're getting into that segment, so I see DJ Ranma S is in chat now.
2296451	2299434	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2320014	2320935	So I don't know what this is.
2320975	2326458	I'm going to open this and see what the hell this is while Jamie's talking so that we don't have dead air.
2326778	2327439	So I have the box.
2327479	2330441	I've already scissored the box open.
2330701	2334043	I just haven't opened the... Not that kind.
2334343	2337205	I have not opened the flaps to dig into the box.
2339252	2341773	Alright, well, so I'll talk about my gaming week.
2342653	2352236	I played some of the Blood Moon event for Dead by Daylight, and I guess I'm going to try to finish the Tome.
2352717	2353177	We'll see.
2354177	2364761	I haven't really been super hyper about wanting to play it lately, but I've done Palia, I have a third property, and I am trying to do more of the decorating glitches.
2366862	2393159	I've learned quite a bit about doing those glitches too so I think it'll work out really nicely and then I've also been playing Mass Effect I enjoyed that I did not play any Monster Hunter Wilds this week I just didn't feel like it I didn't want to deal with the confusing controls but other than that I'm still doing I beat my score again in Fruit Mountain this time I hit over 8000 points
2396341	2419015	which I mean for me kind of a hard thing but yeah that's about what I've been playing and doing just those things they are fun and I know what I like and those are what I like oh I did though pick up Resident Evil 4 remake for Steam because it's on sale right now it's like 50% off love it
2422736	2424597	I'm freaking out a little bit at what's in this box.
2424957	2426038	So you ready to see what's in the box?
2426679	2430301	I'm going to show you the first thing I saw as I was opening the box.
2430321	2430602	You ready?
2430622	2435125	Uh-oh.
2436846	2437627	Do you know what this is?
2438407	2439328	Do you know what Geass is?
2440869	2447414	It is the graphic environment operating system for the Commodore 64.
2448815	2451077	And do you remember how I said this box is very heavy?
2452526	2452826	Yeah.
2458891	2459832	Did he get you a Commodore 64?
2460332	2463235	Oh my god.
2465777	2467998	Sorry for the silence, folks, but I'm unwrapping.
2468419	2471621	This is a yellowed, grotesque...
2473923	2475606	I'm assuming still working.
2476306	2476787	Commodore 64.
2478289	2479470	That is incredible.
2480111	2484637	Ranma, don't spend your money on this kind of stuff for me.
2485058	2485638	Thank you.
2485799	2487881	This is wild.
2487901	2490144	Because, yeah, I've mentioned on the show before...
2490925	2492006	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2510526	2510806	I don't know.
2511027	2513529	There's assorted software in here.
2513950	2517013	Oh, Ranma says my friend was going to toss it.
2517414	2522500	That's... Okay, so you didn't have to pay a lot of money, hopefully.
2522560	2523060	My goodness.
2523080	2523461	Well, thank you.
2523481	2523661	Thank you.
2523701	2524362	This is incredible.
2524742	2525563	What's in this other?
2525603	2526744	Is this like disk drives?
2528606	2528927	Well...
2532513	2534975	I'm not going to pull it out of the box because that's the heavy part.
2536016	2540420	It's a fucking Commodore 64 disk drive in there.
2540620	2546204	So yeah, I'm not going to pull everything out of the box because I want to be able to set this later without messing up the floor in my room.
2546905	2548566	And there's assorted software in here too.
2548666	2549067	So this is...
2549747	2555752	This is incredible, because if I can find discs, I don't know if you can find five and a quarter discs.
2556172	2563058	Maybe you have to order them online or something, but I should be able to write Commodore 64 software to it or something.
2563078	2563859	That's incredible.
2564219	2566301	Ranma, thank you so much.
2566541	2569323	I bet you that Amazon has some still somewhere.
2570985	2575689	Well, also, don't they make ultra-thin drives?
2576735	2577476	They probably do.
2577516	2581239	Yeah, there's probably like other types of peripherals now for sure.
2581259	2583842	I think Bobby stays up on that a little more than I do, so I'll have to see.
2583902	2588066	But I'm sure online enthusiast community for sure.
2588426	2592410	Now I just have to figure out where I'm going to set this up or to what CRT TV.
2594372	2595132	But I'll figure it out.
2595212	2595713	I'll figure it out.
2595733	2596173	There's converters.
2596193	2599476	I remember playing a lot of Millipede on that at my –
2601049	2605751	She's technically my step-aunt, but I called her my cousin.
2606012	2606252	Yeah.
2606832	2608513	But we played a lot of Villapede.
2608813	2609293	A lot.
2609673	2611314	I see her comment in Chad DarkSakura.
2611374	2613235	It was my birthday, but Rob got the presents.
2614556	2615876	To be fair... I was teasing.
2615956	2616657	I know you're teasing.
2616717	2617337	I know you're teasing.
2617397	2622079	But to be fair, everybody knows what a hardcore Commodore 64 enthusiast I was.
2622399	2624220	And that's wild.
2624420	2626942	You know what's... Actually, Rama, I have not seen...
2627782	2629843	Alan, have you overheard what was in this box?
2630003	2630584	Isn't that wild?
2631104	2631304	Yeah.
2631824	2636467	So I have not seen one of the original, original 64s in a long time.
2637007	2637828	Ours broke.
2638528	2640209	And so we actually had a 64C.
2641110	2642911	There was like a white reprinting of them.
2642951	2644271	Think like a PlayStation Pro or something.
2644552	2646533	There was a white reprinting of them that looked very different.
2646593	2648534	That was the one that we had more often.
2648874	2651635	I haven't seen an original, original Commodore 64 like in a very long time.
2652096	2654737	So that's wild.
2654797	2655418	Thank you, Rama.
2655598	2655918	Thank you.
2656633	2657513	I really do appreciate that.
2659334	2664655	I sent him a picture earlier this week of Cheddar sitting on top of the box going, Cheddar wants whatever's in here.
2664735	2665355	Is it chicken?
2667236	2667516	Funny.
2668656	2668936	All right.
2670396	2671296	They can have the box.
2671356	2672677	Cheddar and Oreo can have the box.
2673317	2673557	All right.
2674257	2675617	Let's get into other gaming weeks.
2675637	2678298	I'm sorry for the disruption, but also not sorry.
2678638	2679538	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2680939	2683079	I mainly just played Minecraft.
2683099	2686060	It was a lot of... It was busy, but not like...
2687242	2688183	doing things.
2688903	2700272	We updated our server to 121.5, and so that was a major pain in the ass last night because it just didn't want to... It's still not functioning quite right.
2700332	2702714	It keeps resetting chunks and stuff, which is annoying.
2703255	2705457	But I think we got it all worked out now.
2706397	2713303	And then outside of that, I've been just mainly prepping my brand new retro...
2714023	2715064	Emulation Handheld.
2715464	2731029	I don't know if you can see it, but it's a little device that runs Android and has cool Hall Effects Analog 6 and basically set up like a modern controller.
2731930	2734911	And this thing will run everything up to the Switch.
2736279	2737480	I can do Switch emulation.
2737680	2739561	That's how underpowered the Switch is!
2739961	2743703	That this little Android device can also emulate Switch games.
2744983	2750746	So I have been working on getting together a ROM set for all of that stuff.
2752807	2753467	It's been fun.
2753827	2755928	Oh, but here's the best part.
2756048	2757908	And here's the goal.
2758328	2761249	The thing that I would love to be able to accomplish.
2761969	2773132	So, I saw a video online of somebody running on a GPD2, which I think is a really underpowered... I think it's Intel Atom or something like that.
2773732	2775693	It's a little PC, micro PC thing.
2776513	2778814	It was running Final Fantasy XI.
2780120	2786513	Now, it was running it connected to a private server.
2787526	2811416	that was also running on that device so I'm like if that thing can do that then I can get that thing to do that um in fact actually they do have PC emulators um that can run on that that are capable of running the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5 so if it can run Grand Theft Auto 5 it should be able to handle Final Fantasy 11 at least that's my thought process here um
2811856	2814579	I would love to put, actually, Grand Theft Auto 4 on there if I could.
2814939	2817762	But I'm ready to see what I can do with this thing.
2817942	2819383	Like, how I can max this out.
2820544	2825509	I've got a 1TB card that's going to go into it, so it's a lot of room for things.
2825769	2826009	Nice.
2826449	2826690	Nice.
2827150	2827330	Yeah.
2827611	2827831	Alright.
2829433	2830033	Let's see.
2830273	2831034	My gaming week.
2831914	2833274	I was talking about the mobile games already.
2833294	2836135	I already talked a little bit about Elder Scrolls IV Remastered.
2836175	2837675	I did play a little bit of that.
2838755	2843257	Definitely want to do a little more, although I got to get to the other new stuff that came out last week.
2843797	2846577	One of the other things I've been playing quite a bit of is Final Fantasy XIV.
2846737	2847558	I know, what a shock.
2847698	2850038	But there was a new patch that came out last week.
2850098	2855720	It was a mini patch, but it was for a feature that they had announced for this expansion that I was really looking forward to.
2855780	2857240	It's called Cosmic Exploration.
2857740	2865427	And when they first, first announced it, I thought it was going to be similar to Island Sanctuary, which was in last expansion's content, which I really enjoyed.
2865728	2866809	And I was really excited.
2866829	2869751	I was like, oh, they're going to let us like build and terraform like a planet now.
2870292	2872014	No, it actually didn't turn out like that.
2872114	2873055	It's a little more...
2873595	2874375	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2890425	2890906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2910001	2921408	So this mode is really geared towards that to give the people that really enjoy the crafting and gathering something to kind of pour themselves into as there is like a server-based competition to build things for the moon.
2922129	2930014	That's a throwback to like the fucking – what was that old school WoW thing that everybody had to turn in the wool to open up the tomb of –
2930894	2931434	Anub'Arak?
2931514	2931954	Was that it?
2932174	2932594	Or something?
2933175	2934115	I think so.
2934175	2936015	One of those early, early things, like the raid.
2936296	2937996	You know, everybody on the server had to raid.
2938136	2938916	It's kind of like that.
2938956	2942197	You're building across servers, the different things contributing to it.
2942657	2947459	But the guild lev system was something that was in the original game that they kind of went away from.
2947519	2948639	Guild levs are basically...
2949039	2950020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2970203	2999889	and put that into this so that it it's not like you're doing the same type of crafting over and over it's different from foundation because you don't have to go get the materials then craft them you actually are given them and you have to kind of craft everything it's kind of it's kind of interesting um I don't want to bore those of you that don't play the game they also put crafting fates into it which I thought was really kind of clever you don't actually like furiously craft things but you sort of have a different mechanic that you use um so it's neat so yeah
3000349	3005913	It just goes to show there's more in the game than just the battle stuff, and I think it's kind of neat that they put this whole different mode in it.
3006353	3022444	That all being said, I don't know if there's a lot of longevity in this, but if you're into crafting and gathering, there is a bit of a grind for a really good, like if you're a miner like I am, and you want to get the best pickaxe in the game, the relic pickaxe, you can grind in this mode and you'll get it.
3022784	3026747	So the rewards are worth it, but it's just going to be very grindy.
3027027	3029809	They do have roulette wheels that give you some pretty cool prizes, though.
3030469	3039920	Like some orchestrations from a lot of the songs people really wanted from the last expansion, like a new mount and a couple new pets, you know, cute things like that that people always love to collect.
3040600	3044004	And they finally came out with some new dye colors that are also in this.
3044224	3047187	So, you know, a little reason for people to keep going.
3048089	3049810	But that made up the bulk of my gaming week.
3049930	3051991	I did play some games with friends.
3053032	3057575	I was playing, you know, a little bit of Tetris because I could always... I also played Grandmaster 4 this week.
3057595	3058115	I always forget.
3058175	3059256	I play that on my Steam Deck.
3060196	3061877	That's probably the most played game on my Steam Deck right now.
3063779	3065780	I played F-Zero GX recently.
3066620	3073044	I played it in emulator and it looked better, but then my friend also got his old GameCube and hooked it up and we were playing F-Zero GX and that was really cool.
3073685	3073805	So...
3075766	3078990	Oh, Jamie, do you know what I played this week on a PlayStation?
3079651	3080572	I played Rival Schools.
3081673	3081913	What?
3082073	3083755	Yeah, I thought you'd get a kick out of that.
3085076	3086618	All right, that's it.
3086658	3087439	That's it for my gaming week.
3087619	3092705	We can move on and get into some gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.
3093506	3094487	Loki, we will start with you.
3095621	3099462	Funny enough, I was just talking about my retro game handheld I have.
3099482	3101343	So I got a Retro Pocket Flip 2.
3104103	3110265	One of the other major players in the retro emulation space is Amberdick.
3110965	3115927	And Amberdick actually has just announced that they are going to stop all US shipments
3116687	3132401	Over tariffs, which makes sense because there's a ridiculous percentage of tariffs for products coming from China and essentially that it's going to make it not affordable for them to actually import it.
3133021	3136762	We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S.
3136842	3143264	warehouse so they still have product in the United States so that people can buy without tariffs.
3143784	3154407	But anything beyond that, once they sell through that, they're not going to be shipping anymore back to the United States until the whole tariff situation goes away, which...
3155407	3156548	It could be a few years from now.
3179221	3187070	I mean, we're going to see a massive impact with that, like store shelves being bare and prices going up and all that type of stuff.
3187170	3189033	The worst is yet to come.
3189954	3190795	For a lot over here.
3192437	3193057	Right.
3193918	3195320	Congress could end this tomorrow.
3196321	3196642	They could?
3196822	3196942	Yep.
3200650	3201090	Yeah, I know.
3201110	3201691	It's unfortunate.
3201971	3213940	It's one thing to be talking about video games, but I think there's a lot of things people are looking for, you know, a lot of household items and household electronics that people are going to be a little bit shocked or they're going to suddenly disappear and they're going to be like, how did this happen?
3215814	3226882	Yeah, I mean, and that's why these devices, piracy aside, are great because essentially it's kind of an all-in-one type thing and it's somewhat affordable to be able to emulate your systems.
3226962	3231345	Plus, you can get, I mean, like I said, this one right here, which was, you know, about 200 bucks.
3233732	3234812	Thanks for watching!
3254960	3277575	people are gonna go that route and then on top of that you look at like you know other games like I understand that Oblivion you know being remastered re-released or whatever again um it still wasn't a $70 game it could have been but they charged you know $49.99 for it uh Claire Obscura uh same thing you know that wasn't a full price game either and it's excellent so like
3279187	3281109	There's other options.
3281169	3302891	Eventually, when there's a bunch of games coming out for $80, $90, and those games come out unfinished, or they're just not that great, bad writing, whatever the case may be, everyone's going to start going back towards indie again, where the prices are reasonable, and hopefully the market then settles back down, but I don't know.
3304417	3310602	Yeah, I kind of agree with you that the bubbles, like we're going to see another video game crash, but not in the same way that it crashed in 84.
3311322	3318267	It's going to crash for the AAAs, but not for, excuse me, I should say it's going to crash for the quadruple A's.
3319774	3320634	Except for Nintendo.
3320774	3323535	Nintendo will always be immune to this behavior.
3324136	3337040	But I think a lot of these big budget games are, you know, they're not going to sell to the extent that, you know... And I'm even curious, you know, yeah, sure, the Switch 2's kind of sold through and sold out real quick, but...
3337600	3339202	How many was that at the end of the day?
3339262	3343607	I'm sitting here giving Nintendo a lot of credit going, well, they must have had more to go through and they got it right.
3343947	3346950	Well, or was there maybe actually less people going for it?
3347010	3351315	It doesn't feel like it based on social media, but I also follow a lot of gamers on social media.
3351975	3352956	So, I don't know.
3353277	3354218	It's hard to tell.
3354238	3354939	It's hard to tell.
3356052	3356312	All right.
3356772	3360774	Well, Loki brought up Oblivion Remastered, and of course, so did I. We've been talking about it.
3361795	3365596	I don't have to sit here and tell you that, surprise, it came out this week.
3366016	3368157	But let's talk a little bit about the release.
3368758	3371699	So the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion was remastered.
3372579	3376301	Bethesda brought in an external developer, Virtuos, that worked on this.
3377061	3382204	Um, you know, obviously there were the leaks and the website stuff and all that stuff, but you know, whatever, it happened.
3382785	3388528	Uh, the game did release on PC via Steam, uh, but also the Xbox app, if you want to get it that way.
3388968	3392551	It released on Xbox Series S and X, and it is on the PlayStation 5.
3393071	3402777	So, you know, Sony, uh, or excuse me, Microsoft putting this out on Sony platforms, even though, uh, Elder Scrolls is a Microsoft product now because of, uh, Microsoft's ownership of Bethesda.
3403578	3418813	Oblivion Remastered is also on Game Pass and that was admittedly why I jumped right into it the game will include the Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles expansion there are extras that are available if you do want to pick that up and yes
3419514	3432280	Horse Armor DLC is one of those things that you can buy, which is sort of a parody of itself, because if you think about it, Horse Armor is a big part of the reason why gaming is the way it is now.
3433040	3437882	And I say that because Elder Scrolls Oblivion 4 was a early, early game.
3437922	3439723	I think a release game, actually, on the Xbox 360.
3440063	3441984	It was close to release.
3442064	3444385	It came out within a month, a few months later.
3444545	3446566	Yeah, like April of 2006, I think.
3447586	3448867	The Horse Armor did exist.
3467236	3470157	Yeah, there was, but this was special horse armor.
3470177	3471797	It was horse armor like no other.
3472918	3477979	And now this is almost standard for almost any AAA game that comes out.
3478279	3486841	Has some type of horse armor, whether that's transmog for your main character or something special in the game that's cosmetic.
3487182	3491003	This is a very standard sort of thing now that you see in every game.
3491463	3491763	So...
3493004	3503912	It's not really a huge surprise to see that Horse Armor has also made its way to the Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered.
3504012	3506795	I did not see, however, how much the Horse Armor cost.
3507295	3508636	Do we know that yet?
3509557	3512940	I thought that was included with the DLC, because it came with all the DLC.
3513340	3519105	I think it was, if you got a deluxe edition of the game, you could get that.
3520302	3533126	I thought that the extra... So I think it still does come with all of the DLC, but there's additional skins or additional horse armor skins and player skins for...
3535788	3538150	are also available, I think, if I remember correctly.
3538451	3539091	Let's see here.
3539292	3545059	So I'm looking at the Steam page and there is a digital deluxe edition or the regular Raymaster.
3545099	3547502	And I don't see any other DLC.
3548022	3549985	I just see a $10 deluxe upgrade.
3550005	3551947	The deluxe upgrade includes...
3553769	3562276	Armor of Order and Armor of Cataclysm, Weapons of Order and Weapons of Cataclysm, and Horse Armor in the Order and Cataclysm variations.
3562316	3566759	And the Order one looks very similar to the classic Horse Armor from the original.
3567320	3568161	It's new, though.
3568501	3569362	It's not the same.
3569422	3570322	No, it is not the same.
3570362	3570683	You're right.
3570723	3571403	It is not the same.
3572384	3573385	It's new Horse Armor.
3573405	3573505	Yeah.
3575286	3576007	They're doing it again.
3576067	3577388	They're selling you Horse Armor again.
3577448	3578549	Damn it, Todd Howard!
3578649	3579070	Damn it!
3580130	3583994	Well, you know, y'all could always just not buy it.
3586224	3610781	or or here's something you know like even though they don't support modding supports mods you don't need to buy horse armor it does literally get horse armor for free it does and i think uh i know alan will be jumping on that as soon as they release mods for the good stuff you know like nude mods and uh i mean he likes ui mods he likes ui mods that's what i'm saying like even though like they'll offer you free horse armor and they'll make your horse's ass fatter so like it's it is
3612206	3615789	The modding community will give you a lot more than Bethesda will.
3616109	3629358	If it's not already out, can we get a fat fucking ass mod for the game, which makes everybody's ass fatter, but also the horses, the rats, everybody's ass just gets fatter.
3629478	3630459	Every ass is bigger.
3631319	3632200	Juicy ass mod.
3634039	3634940	It's thick.
3636061	3638023	Yeah, T-H-I-C-C.
3639605	3640165	Thick mode.
3640265	3641687	Thickum's mode.
3644689	3645270	I love that.
3646491	3646832	All right.
3647612	3651116	Well, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about another game that maybe we want thick asses in?
3652981	3653662	Are you sure?
3653902	3654362	Maybe.
3654602	3656264	It's Sonic.
3657185	3662749	So Sonic and Shadow Generations is coming to Switch 2.
3665632	3667373	They have just announced this.
3667634	3668855	Well, actually they announced it
3669335	3671476	much earlier in the month.
3672337	3679702	But it's already on the Switch right now, but they really want to have this one to come forward on the new system.
3680482	3691129	That's also Yakuza 0, Director's Cut, Raido Remastered, POPO Tetris 2S, and Two Point Museum as well.
3691189	3692630	Those are also included on the list.
3693270	3697453	But the big one is Shadow and Sonic.
3698254	3698714	So there you go.
3699636	3702219	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3721440	3727305	are on those digital unlock cards where the game isn't even on the card, it's just the digital unlock.
3727425	3734872	Apparently first party is pretty much all on cartridges, but third parties, like almost all of them are digital unlock cards, which I'm sure you're thrilled to hear.
3736834	3743440	Yeah, of course, because when the servers go down, that's going to be so wonderful that they're going to have that available.
3744346	3746467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3774255	3778558	Y'all, anytime a console is unhackable, that just raises the bar.
3778718	3791246	It's going to take them time, but there will come a time, there will come a day where people hack that thing open so that you can sideload content in there and people will figure out how to rip that download stuff in the store and be able to sideload it on the Switch 2.
3791926	3802453	They won't figure it out in the first day, and certainly if you don't want Nintendo to sue your ass, your fat ass, then you don't want to do that within the first, you know, pretty much during the life of the Switch 2, essentially.
3803034	3803274	But,
3803954	3804835	It's going to happen.
3805035	3807657	And so that's how these games will ultimately get preserved.
3807737	3814243	And it is really fucking weird that I'm saying we're relying on the modding and the piracy community to help us preserve games.
3814643	3819207	But that is exactly what I'm saying in a weird sort of way.
3819928	3821029	And I think it will get there.
3821049	3821970	It's just going to take a little time.
3824284	3828525	So because again, you shouldn't you shouldn't be sideloading games the first day.
3828606	3829866	That's just straight up piracy.
3830266	3833507	And that doesn't support, you know, the people that make the games and all that.
3833527	3838269	It's also not that many Switch 2 games that you could be sideloading or pirating anyways day one.
3838309	3838849	So like.
3839969	3841730	That's got to wait for a few years.
3842510	3844131	There's nothing to download yet.
3844987	3847708	Ranmar A68K in chat says, I mean, let's be real.
3847808	3850068	Corporations don't care about game preservation.
3850448	3851509	That's up to the community.
3851829	3852789	For the most part, yes.
3852869	3858330	There are some companies I feel like have gone a little ways to try to make this better.
3858450	3868512	I feel like Microsoft's actually one of the better ones, which is weird because that wasn't always their MO, you know, when they got rid of the backwards compatibility for Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
3868832	3871313	But then they really made an effort to go back and do a lot of that.
3872053	3893769	and I feel like also ironically they own Blizzard now and Blizzard's been very good at preserving their catalog like they remaster it but they also have it in a way that you can preserve it they let good old games have Diablo you know which is also a big preservation thing so I do feel like there are some companies that recognize I think it also helps that Phil Spencer's gone on record saying he recognizes the importance of it
3894269	3921688	but I do agree for the most part most corporations don't give a shit or they want to be able to continue to sell it to you for some time which in a way I mean again looking at Microsoft Bethesda that's kind of what Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered is it's a way to sell you a 20 year old game all over again but of course I say sell because Game Pass is a big draw for that I feel like this game is getting a lot of traction off Game Pass but there's a lot of people playing it on PlayStation 5 as well so
3924157	3947424	but the good news is I will say this the good news is if you want to get the original Oblivion you still can it is being sold in tandem with the remaster you can still get the OG 2006 Oblivion which is cool but at this point honestly unless you really are looking for the Mr. Potato Head faces like the remastered is all the same bugs you remember but
3949517	3950738	They didn't fix that.
3951338	3952399	I do kind of like that.
3952459	3954601	I mean, I get it.
3954801	3957443	We've all gaslit ourselves into accepting bugs now.
3957503	3958864	It's so wild.
3959544	3963327	I like buggy games in the sense that it makes it so I can exploit them.
3963627	3965068	And that's what makes it fun for me.
3965248	3965949	You always have.
3966169	3969271	That's one of the things I used to like.
3969291	3973014	You were the one person that was like, Driver 3 is awesome, but not for the races you think.
3973394	3988507	it was so like here's how I play my only memories of Oblivion I didn't play much of Oblivion when it came out on console even though it was yeah like on Xbox 360 and stuff like that and I remember playing it day one and all that but
3989207	4013209	like here's how I play because I didn't understand what I was supposed to do in the game so I ended up joining like the thieves guild and then once you're in there like all the items that are on the shelves aren't you know stolen anymore so you could just take it all and so that's what I do I'd go into someone's house and I just take all the stuff and I take it to the store and go sell it and then there was like I think a dupe glitch at the time to like duplicate armor and everything and
4013749	4014670	I don't remember any of that, so...
4026525	4051129	I guess I'll get to play this game legit the first time you know that I think for some people is the entire charm of Elder Scrolls it's also for other people the biggest turnoff of Elder Scrolls is that you do have that ability to literally do anything in the open world and you can just fuck off the main game you can just say I don't want to play the main game I just want to I just want to murder people and try to get away with it and that's what that was a
4051169	4051949	Thanks for watching!
4071096	4078486	and why The Elder Scrolls 6 is taking fucking forever because they've set such a bar for themselves when it comes to this wide open world.
4078827	4085316	And I really hope to hell, I really hope to hell they don't use generative AI to try to fill in the gaps, especially with Quest.
4085997	4086017	I...
4087839	4094240	I sort of trust the Elder Scrolls to know that people are going to see right through that and are going to, you know, and it's been taking them this long.
4094280	4101722	So you hope a lot of it has been cooked up and they're not going to rely on AI, generative AI anyway, to come up with quests and books and things like that.
4102042	4105063	Because, you know, they have radiant quests, which were lame.
4105283	4108844	Yeah, I remember that where it's like, go to this place and get this thing.
4109484	4110844	And it was just that over and over.
4111965	4115449	So we'll see, but it's interesting to see how this is all new again.
4115549	4115830	All right.
4116190	4117431	Anyway, where were we?
4117512	4119153	Loki, let's go back to your next story.
4120455	4120916	All right.
4121837	4122878	Sorry, I'm being distracted.
4122918	4123919	The cat's over here.
4124620	4125721	Great reason to be distracted.
4126642	4126983	Skate 4.
4129221	4133646	I don't know why this is a shock, or the Skate reboot, whatever we're going to call it.
4133767	4134487	Skate, I guess.
4135308	4138072	It's coming out, I think, later this year, actually.
4138592	4140575	And it's going to be online only.
4140975	4141456	Why is that?
4141516	4143478	Because it's a live service game, so duh.
4144019	4144359	It is...
4145821	4149304	There is not going to be an offline version of the game, EA said.
4149384	4159733	The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing, massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving and always full of microtransactions.
4159773	4162355	I'm sorry, that was my bit added there.
4164077	4165037	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
4165157	4167339	I mean, once I heard it was a live service game, I was like, yeah, of course.
4167580	4168180	Of course it is.
4168560	4168761	So...
4169517	4174038	Well, this is somewhat a dangerous stance for companies to take now with what's going on with Ubisoft and the crew.
4174058	4176139	It can't function offline.
4176579	4177899	It's SimCity.
4177939	4180740	The odd line is integral to its functionality.
4180800	4182180	It cannot work offline.
4183581	4190382	Man, I wish we would get a new SimCity game to just erase the taste from our mouths of what happened with the last one.
4190642	4192683	I'm going to attempt to list this kitty up here.
4192723	4194483	She does not like being held.
4194763	4196984	Is this the kitty that roams from house to house?
4198200	4199541	It's our kitty, basically, now.
4200142	4200602	Aw.
4201102	4201843	There she is.
4201883	4202563	Hi, kitty.
4203124	4203484	Oh, no.
4203544	4205466	The camera's kind of glitching a little bit, but we can get a sense.
4205486	4206527	We can get a sense.
4206867	4210089	Your green screen is just thinking that parts of the cat are green, but that's all right.
4210950	4211811	Oh, yeah.
4212011	4212651	She's a pretty kitty.
4212731	4212992	Okay.
4213292	4213612	All right.
4213632	4215133	Bye, kitty.
4215814	4215954	Aw.
4216154	4216875	The baby!
4217355	4218516	Please clip the cat sighting.
4218536	4218916	Thank you.
4219757	4220017	All right.
4221324	4222865	Um, let's move on.
4222945	4224225	I find this very interesting.
4224265	4226046	It's also not surprising whatsoever.
4226646	4232309	Um, it has to do with, um, video game journalism online, people's favorite topics, right?
4232789	4240412	Apparently, uh, this, and this is a story to be fair that I got off Reddit on a website called thegamebusiness.com that's running this report.
4240512	4242093	Not a website I'm super familiar with.
4242153	4245774	It's not like, uh, it was a gameindustry.biz or, you know, one of those big sites.
4246395	4246735	But I...
4247555	4258802	Just in my own consumption of journalism online, and I think a lot of your own ways you consume gaming media, I think you can see how a story like this makes a lot of sense.
4259883	4266347	So apparently, based on data from the press engine, the top 135 video game websites published over 635,000 articles.
4271630	4277157	so when we're talking about major outlets we mean IGN, GameSpot, Famitsu, Eurogamer 635,000 articles that's actually a drop
4282699	4287241	of 13%, 100,000 articles less than the same period, quarter one in 2024.
4288401	4291163	And that's even with the Switch 2 announcement.
4291183	4293964	Although I guess, no, that wasn't until quarter two, so maybe we can't count that.
4294004	4296305	But still, you would still expect there'd be a lot.
4297105	4303368	This means reviews, news, guides, features, codes, and all of that different stuff.
4303668	4307350	Press Engine, what this is, this is a PR tool.
4307890	4316674	That if you're a developer, if you're a publisher, you use this to send out game codes and press releases to journalists and content creators through this press engine.
4318274	4327618	But apparently in the press engine, they've actually seen the number of press contacts, nearly 3000 of them, about 2900, disappear from the database over two years.
4328098	4329098	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
4355447	4363231	So, the industry's perspective on this is that the games media is apparently scaling back coverage of games outside the big AAA games.
4363932	4370796	And this is very harmful to indie games, smaller games, other games, trying to make a name for themselves.
4371796	4376379	In a quote from Gareth Williams, the founder of the Press Engine...
4377139	4378220	Thank you for watching.
4378440	4379301	I'll see you next time.
4398277	4406748	And it's interesting, I think, because we live in this era of a lot of Twitch influence, YouTube influence, TikTok influence.
4407149	4410253	Because that's one thing I'm realizing with this Oblivion remaster.
4410954	4413898	I'm seeing a lot of content for Oblivion remaster on TikTok.
4414238	4418019	Now, granted, I've probably fallen into that algorithm now because I've watched enough of it.
4418359	4419459	But I'm seeing these things.
4419519	4423420	It's like, fine, the strongest helmet in the game as soon as you come out of the dungeon.
4423500	4426161	And so he's going, you just go to this point on your map.
4426641	4428401	Or it'll be people showing bugs.
4428801	4429741	I can't tell you.
4429761	4434022	I've seen at least five videos where people are like, here's the bug in 2006.
4435263	4436203	Here's the bug in 2025.
4437283	4438283	And it's like the same thing.
4438323	4439663	And it's a lot of that on TikTok.
4440024	4441884	And I also feel like short form bugs.
4442604	4454878	Social media, meaning things like X for people for whatever reason that still choose to use that, and Blue Sky and Mastodon, that short form social media has really stepped in for a lot of this.
4454959	4459023	Just curious out there, a little informal poll in chat.
4459784	4470928	How many of you were getting your Switch 2 pre-order information from a Wario64, from a cheap-ass gamer, from a social media person?
4472229	4474269	How many of you were getting your stuff from that?
4474469	4478191	I bet an awful lot of you were getting that stuff from social media.
4479091	4493606	because that is now and it's interesting because the thing with social media is because you're limited to only what 300 characters on Blue Sky and it's similar on Mastodon and the others because it's similar these social media posts have to get to the fucking point
4494608	4498150	And that's been a big frustration with a lot of other types of gaming journalism.
4498430	4502212	We all know on YouTube, they never get to the fucking point, right?
4502232	4504493	You gotta watch five minutes of bullshit to get this.
4504853	4506094	And then, you know, the... The...
4511669	4528911	words escape me at this moment sometimes even like articles and stuff you know the clickbait headline you'll never believe what game just fucking got delisted and it talks here's how the Xbox store works here's that and then finally there'll be like a throwaway and it's like this game that none of you have ever heard of
4529572	4529772	E3VL E3VL
4550101	4554446	DarkTetsuya said, both them and the Switch-centric blogs I follow on BlueSky.
4555387	4557549	PodCulture says, I got my info from y'all.
4557590	4558511	Well, that's sweet.
4558551	4558891	Thank you.
4559452	4568361	I guess I have to remember, there are a few of you out there who really do get your little gaming dose here on this show, and we appreciate that and hope you were able to get a Switch if you wanted one.
4568882	4569002	So...
4571215	4576118	Renmari says, I just follow one particular person who covers a ton of Japanese games.
4576419	4577619	Well, that also makes sense.
4577719	4583323	If there's somebody that's really into a genre or a type, like, especially I would imagine like fighting games.
4584164	4597593	If you want to see every like fighting game character that's going to be released or every, you know, that really like hyper focuses on that genre, every costume, there's probably some social media accounts that really do that a lot better than maybe the more general ones or a
4599594	4608103	That's another kind of perk about short form social media, wherever you're consuming it, is that you get a lot of people that are very tailored to your interests.
4608543	4613508	Sorry, I'm giggling because live here on Twitch, Loki is out feeding the cats or something.
4613689	4618594	And the way the green screen works, once in a while, he just fuses into the oblivion scene.
4619475	4621597	And I'm getting Nick Arcade flashbacks.
4624804	4626185	Anyway, it's just kind of funny.
4627486	4627746	All right.
4628366	4636511	Ranmari says, because even when sites like IGN do cover my usual niches, it's obviously often with a ton of ignorance.
4638092	4643535	I don't necessarily disagree, but I do feel like a lot of sites are getting better.
4643975	4648118	I think a lot of sites realize they've been called out on this over the years.
4648718	4663548	and I've tried to get more in tune with people and this is why hiring diverse journalists is very helpful because you get a lot of diverse tastes, diverse perspectives and why I think more websites out there are succeeding in this department.
4663588	4675375	Not always and I'm sure you can cite some examples where they are not getting it right but I do feel like overall I see a lot of gaming blogs and places are being a little more accurate and
4677311	4683700	Faithful in tune with what the fans want in certain genres, at least again compared to, say, 2006 or whatever.
4686344	4691371	But anyway, I found that story very interesting, and it's definitely showing a way that things are changing online.
4691671	4692112	You know, just...
4693274	4701516	On a quick tangent relating things to the real world, again on TikTok, you know that guy, I'm sure you've all seen him on your TikTok feed at some point if you use TikTok.
4701536	4705037	I'm sure you've seen him on your feed at some point, that Aaron Parnas who comes through.
4705597	4706498	We have breaking news.
4706878	4708058	We have news on the Trump terrorist.
4708938	4709839	He's this young guy.
4709879	4717921	He's like 25 years old and he's really mastered working that TikTok algorithm where there are legitimately a ton of people that are getting news from him.
4718741	4721844	and people like him because there's, you know, now a lot of people are knocking that off.
4722224	4728589	There's a lot of people getting their news or and he's probably not the first to do it, to be fair, but he is the one that has been the most prolific out there on TikTok.
4730310	4741279	There are people that get their news from him versus traditional media versus USA Today or the New York Times versus even CNN or Fox News or MSNBC.
4741860	4748125	It's kind of unlocking this whole other way that people consume news, which I just I just think that stuff is very fascinating.
4749557	4778151	so anyway but there's always time for a movie so we'll go to our next story, DarkSakura so yeah we are looking at a Michael Bay movie I don't know how I feel about that another one Sidney Sweeney and Michael Bay are going to be doing an Outrun video game it is a video game, Outrun movie
4781482	4807912	they are producing it basically going through just a driving fun time and outrun they're saying it's going to be going through Universal the screenplay is being written by Jason Rothwell who did Polar and Arachnid I don't know how I feel about that either but yeah
4809431	4811953	We'll see if it actually happens or if it'll be any good.
4815075	4820680	I don't have my hopes up very high, but then again, video game media in general has been surprisingly good the last few years.
4820840	4825283	Again, you say Michael Bay and I go, but maybe it'll have some really good special effects.
4825704	4829627	Maybe they want to get that fast in the furious audience, although that's also a universal product.
4829667	4830367	So I don't know.
4830467	4833350	Maybe this is something they want to put out in the off years.
4833470	4833810	I don't know.
4834390	4834531	Um,
4835934	4840359	It's just such a weird property to come back, but at the same time, it can be fun.
4841480	4841680	Right?
4841740	4843021	I think an OutRun movie can be fun.
4844443	4847125	I think... I mean, it's universal.
4847786	4848807	It's Michael Bay.
4849408	4854433	I mean, it's essentially they're making Fast and the Furious again, but just different.
4854813	4856735	But with a Ferrari.
4857356	4858417	I agree that it's a...
4860530	4861331	It better be a four.
4861431	4863132	Off year for Fast and the Furious.
4863492	4865033	And they've made so many of those movies.
4866074	4866514	So many.
4867775	4869136	How many Fast and Furious movies are there?
4869156	4870997	Aren't there like 12 at least?
4871838	4870997	50,000.
4873639	4874200	It's over 10.
4874580	4875100	I know that.
4875360	4875901	Oh my God.
4876401	4877162	Wild, wild, wild.
4877242	4878463	Okay.
4878803	4882045	If they get any more Fast or Furious, they'll be in another dimension.
4883866	4884187	All right.
4885327	4888329	Let's move on and talk about this story.
4888390	4888670	Loki.
4890031	4891092	All right.
4892172	4895654	So anyways, we've got... Why is my screen not coming up?
4896774	4898275	Ubisoft.
4898775	4901857	You know, they are data harvesting now.
4901877	4903097	Because, I mean, why not?
4903137	4905638	Just throw it on top of the pile of all the bad things that they do.
4906119	4909160	So they've been fined 79 million euro.
4910601	4917184	And essentially that they found that they are doing some hidden data harvesting stuff.
4918103	4939638	there is basically the complaint centers on Far Cry Primal and Assassin's Creed Shadows which required an internet connection despite being offline experiences and the lawsuit is alleging that Ubisoft is using this to siphon off players gaming habits um
4941724	4952375	basically say that one user noted that Far Cry Primal noticed the game pinged external servers including those of Amazon and Google 150 times in 10 minutes.
4954257	4961625	I'm not really sure what their their I thought it was for authentication but who knows.
4962812	4973103	Um, yeah, interesting to see what comes out of this, if that's the case, if they actually find... I mean, obviously, they're facing a fine of $79 million.
4973603	4979409	I don't think it's been actually determined whether or not they're at fault yet, but... Right.
4980691	4981091	I don't know.
4981572	4985155	It's weird that they would...
4986018	4992460	Be stealing data or something like... I mean, it's not weird that they'd be doing that, but I thought that these servers were mainly for authentication, which is ridiculous.
4992501	4994901	It's like an anti-piracy thing, essentially.
4995001	5002244	Or to incorporate Ubisoft Plus or whatever the hell that they had in their Ubisoft Club or something.
5002264	5005726	I don't know.
5006266	5006686	We'll see.
5006706	5010667	I would not be surprised if it comes out that they're stealing people's data, too.
5010748	5010948	Why not?
5010968	5011548	I mean, because...
5012469	5013730	They're a terrible company.
5014050	5014370	Yeah.
5014530	5024097	And like, or, you know, that I think sometimes maybe the intentions weren't necessarily dubious, but there's a lot of ignorance that comes to it.
5024177	5027739	Well, let's just, you know, run this thing and maybe this will be useful at some point.
5027779	5031622	And they don't really think about like what, how that can be perceived by the people playing the games.
5031842	5033903	And I think maybe that'll...
5035891	5036151	FOMO's Mofo
5059676	5060956	Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast
5082810	5084450	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5106576	5108999	Last Christmas I got an Evercade.
5109841	5118332	And I tried to play those cartridges and it said, womp womp, these cartridges are licensed for handheld use only.
5118433	5121196	Like I couldn't play them on my Versys and I was like, that's a bunch of bullshit.
5121216	5121777	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
5122518	5124258	Apparently that situation has been rectified.
5124638	5134320	And I thought something was weird because as you may or may not know, I picked up this Evercade versus, I'm sorry, this Evercade arcade machine that sits behind me.
5134360	5135901	My big head covers it when we tape.
5136241	5147303	But I have a Mega Man branded machine because it has some Capcom titles, including Strider, Final Fight, and the two Mega Man fighting games are built into that Evercade machine.
5147343	5151764	And you can see there are two cartridges, those little white lines behind me on Twitch.
5153049	5154149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5173795	5198089	or they have worked out these rights issues so yeah a post in the official Evercade group on Facebook said obviously the Namco carts worked on the Evercade versus but apparently on April 16th there was a some update that happened and now Evercade replied and said all cartridges are now compatible please check our website for any frequently asked questions so that's great
5198869	5202790	I'm surprised they're not making a bigger deal out of that, but I don't know if those cartridges are easy to find.
5202830	5204451	I feel like those cartridges might be out of print.
5204771	5209112	I think that was part of the reason I was jumping on getting them was that they were going to stop printing those cartridges.
5209933	5211893	But yay, I'm glad they work now.
5212294	5217035	By the way, I have other news on the Evercade front, though, if you don't have one yet.
5218476	5218996	Guess what?
5219876	5222017	US orders are being paused.
5237022	5249107	Apparently, Evercade has said, because Evercade is a UK company, they are, quote, taking a cautious approach to the situation by, quote, temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers.
5249607	5253649	Until we know more, we do not want to put customers at risk of unexpected charges.
5253709	5255390	And that's in a statement from Funstock.
5256090	5260593	As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward.
5260893	5265637	This pause in service will be effective from Monday, the 28th of April and means that customers in the U.S.
5265997	5268699	will not be able to make new orders on our website.
5269259	5279226	I'm going to guess that they're going to pass off any tariff costs directly to the consumer as an additional tax, which you think that would piss me off, but it's not Evercade's fault.
5279606	5280767	Y'all know whose fault it is.
5281467	5283389	Congress could end this tomorrow.
5285370	5285850	But they won't.
5288152	5291235	Yeah, I like the way Rin Mari in chat puts this.
5291415	5292736	Doofus J. Tariffs.
5293677	5294217	That's right.
5297740	5299381	Doofus J. Tariffs.
5302824	5303164	All right.
5304245	5306007	Let's go to a non-doofy part of the show.
5306067	5309169	It's a chance for DarkSakura to take a trip down memory lane.
5309549	5310150	Let's roll the bump.
5320714	5321054	DarkSakura.com
5343345	5363601	but it works it's for Nintendo DS it's the Korg DS10 synthesizer and I kind of got a little inspired watching it because I was watching this guy I always mix his name David Horowitz who puts out interesting videos
5364221	5373538	instrument samplers, VST units for typical DAWs, like Logic Pro.
5373838	5375121	What's the other ones?
5378858	5393593	not Serato DJ there's the other one Pro Tools I think is the other one but anyway this is a music creation program and it emulates the core MS synthesizers
5396796	5403181	When people usually talk about the Korg MS-10, it's a single oscillator monosynth.
5404022	5409266	This adds the sync that the Korg MS-20 doesn't have.
5409306	5414610	So this was released originally in Japan on July 27, 2008, October 10, 2008 in Europe, and November 4, the same year in the United States.
5420234	5448342	there's a newer DSi compatible version called the Korg DS10 Plus that was released in 2009 but we're talking about this one so basically it creates sound with two analog synthesizer emulators each with two voltage controlled oscillators where the Korg MS-10 had only one VCO
5449442	5476418	um it has a sawtooth a pulse a triangle and noise waveform there's a four-part drum machine um that uh uses the same techniques as the synthesizers the um you can of course tweak them with virtual knobs change the value of the synthesizer parameters like cut off waveform shape you know just the typical stuff that you would have on like a you know any DAW um
5479708	5491131	But with the interface, since you're using the touchscreen, you can use your finger to move things around, to change your position.
5492171	5503133	And it simulates, using a stylus, it simulates the Korg Chaos Pad, which is another touchscreen Korg sampler and audio processor.
5503153	5503493	It came out in 1999.
5503554	5503774	Pretty cool.
5506074	5530666	um you can record 21 sessions with 16 different step patterns um with either live input or through a sequencer i mean this is fairly fairly you know for for something that is coming up on almost 20 years old we're still using these same things today when i make music and i'm playing with an eq
5531966	5536470	I mean, or with any sort of software instrument.
5537050	5539932	I'm usually tweaking the same type of stuff this is talking about.
5542694	5554083	But the effects it has available is a chorus, a flanger, a flanger, sorry, I always get the word bad, a delay parameter, which, I mean, again, that's standard fare.
5555184	5560208	And you can edit the drum sounds, so they'll have different effects globally.
5560868	5562649	So it did get a great review.
5563489	5567451	82 out of 100 on Metacritic, 85% on GameRankings.
5568231	5584357	IGN gave it a low score, the lowest score, even though it wasn't very low, 7.1 out of 10 and said, quote, it isn't standalone full-featured music software, however, sorry, but other reviewers get very positive scores.
5584397	5588218	I mean, basically, this is a great little synthesizer to have on the go.
5588238	5589379	It's
5591778	5593799	You can make tons of music with it.
5594420	5610490	The example I saw today was actually using this and then some software that was made specifically for the Game Boy to use its in-system instruments and did a nice little ditty out of the two.
5611051	5613172	So there were follow-ups.
5613312	5618255	There was the Korg M-O-N-D that came out for the 3DS and the eShop.
5619852	5621113	That was in 2013.
5622154	5627918	And it had sounds from the Korg M1 and sounds from the Korg O1W.
5628418	5641127	In 2014, Korg DSN12 came out on 3DS that focused, and I quote, the user creating their own unique synth sounds from scratch and had a 3D oscilloscope screen that let you visualize your sounds.
5641947	5642768	But, yeah.
5644349	5648412	Honestly, I probably want to
5649770	5676726	go pick this up and I'm sure I can find it pretty easily but especially with the fact I've been making my own stuff a lot lately I think this is a fun tool and it does it really is a full functioning system you are going to need a few other bells and whistles a few other accessories to get the most out of it but there you go
5677130	5684317	I still think that's pretty rad that like all these years later, this is still a very functional sort of music making system to be using.
5685478	5691944	Kind of ironic because, you know, we had the Commodore 64 cameo earlier in the show, thanks to DJ Ranma S.
5692644	5716310	and I sort of see that in a similar thing too is that one of the best things that Commodore 64 still has going for all of these years later fucking 40 years later after it was released is that it makes some fucking incredible chiptune music that musicians today still use and I think the same could be said of a platform like this so you know I was that name I was referring to was David Hillowitz hmm
5717586	5725012	Um, and, you know, I actually, I'm just gonna, for those of us who are here, um, in chat, I'm gonna link his YouTube.
5726252	5729495	But, um, it's David Hillowitz Music.
5729795	5732077	It's H-I-L-O-W-I-T-Z.
5732797	5741163	He basically, he did that whole series using, um, the Game Boy and the DS.
5741203	5741604	Yes.
5742918	5750981	to make music and put that, you know, live up on how he does it and so that other people can do it.
5751121	5757344	But one thing I like is that he goes in and finds like interesting instruments out there and samples them.
5757384	5768508	Like one of them was Casio's vaporwave guitar or an Omnicord, Casio keyboards, old mandolins, just kind of a toothbrush.
5769448	5770589	He made samples from a toothbrush.
5773171	5787109	but this one when I saw that was there I was like oh this is so cool so I absolutely suggest finding that video on his channel and giving it a watch but he goes a lot into this particular game as well
5787895	5788155	All right.
5788695	5789195	Cool pick.
5789295	5794337	I mean, yeah, maybe it's more of an application for the system, but they put it on a game cart.
5795637	5796837	I still say it fits.
5796977	5797757	It's a good choice.
5797817	5799018	I reckon you could play with it.
5799338	5801398	That's right.
5801458	5805579	I used to say playing with the piano when I'm just sitting there diddling out a song, so why not?
5805679	5805939	All right.
5806579	5808520	Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5809600	5810580	Just a little bit more for you.
5810600	5816822	We didn't have a ton of news this week, surprisingly, but we do have some rapid fire hits to get to, so Loki.
5818052	5843558	yeah so this is kind of fun so you may remember back they i think it was for the playstation anniversary the 30th anniversary they had put up some limited time skins for your playstation 5 that kind of you know did like the playstation 1 buddha playstation 2 playstation 3 and stuff like that but it was only a limited time thing um but now they've uh with a new patch they brought them back
5844218	5850106	So you can actually keep them on your console now and boot up with those classic themes.
5852790	5853330	Pretty cool.
5854191	5854652	I like that.
5856915	5857115	Nice.
5859258	5860460	Let's move on to Dark Sakura.
5863985	5870795	We have a Wheel of Time open world RPG adaptation.
5872337	5875862	I know no one asked for this, but it looks like it's going to happen.
5875882	5877024	I mean...
5882301	5884622	People love Robert Jordan's books.
5885643	5890585	There was a first-person shooter that was based off of it that's available on GOG.
5892666	5899489	This has a three-year development cycle that they're anticipating.
5901390	5905712	The involvement is going to be Warner Bros.
5905732	5908893	Entertainment, Activision, EA, and Sierra Online.
5912469	5912790	Alright.
5914612	5918598	I don't know the books very well, but apparently the TV show is pretty good too.
5919339	5920821	And I know people that are really into the books.
5921061	5922063	So why not a game?
5922163	5922484	Why not?
5924272	5928614	Let's talk about a recent release that is landing very well with folks out there.
5928694	5930495	It's Claire Obscure, Expedition 33.
5930595	5933936	I promise I will get around to this eventually because this really does sound like my jam.
5934396	5936717	But it's only been out just a few days.
5936777	5937317	And guess what?
5937457	5944620	After those first three days... Well, actually, I should say after the first day, it hit 500,000 in sales.
5945020	5948161	And then after three days, it hit 1 million.
5948221	5952003	And that is still considering it is available on Game Pass.
5952023	5952303	Wow.
5952563	5956567	So you can get the game on PC, Xbox Series X or S and PlayStation 5.
5957649	5959170	But the game is selling very well.
5959210	5965457	Apparently it has the, I think I was seeing the highest Metacritic user score ever.
5966314	5968235	Thank you for watching!
5987142	5987943	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6007213	6008154	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6027048	6029930	be turn-based, which would be wild to see if that happens.
6029970	6041057	I mean, they're probably far enough along in development if they did that, but they're probably far enough along in development they can't 180, but then again, you think about how long 15 was in development, anything's possible.
6042498	6050023	17 could also be another online game, which would fit the every three pattern, 11, 14, although I guess that's not much of a pattern, but it could.
6051724	6052124	So we'll see.
6053743	6058704	Alright, FifthDream in chat says 17 is an MMO.
6058744	6061785	A lot of people seem to think that, but we'll see, we'll see.
6062705	6070247	Okay, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out in a store or digital storefront near you.
6070548	6071508	Loki, let's start with the U.S.
6072307	6100776	Not a whole lot of things this week, but we've got Cooking Companions on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation 5 Frag Punk on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series MotoGP 25 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PlayStation 5 Neptunia Riders vs. Doggos

6134174	6135434	Not the Shotgun Cop Man.
6136610	6141933	Shotgun Cop Man Alright, well heading over to Japan, guess what week it is?
6142433	6161682	It's one week a year where I go to the games That's right, Golden Week is this week So running from the 29th to May 6th Showa Day, Constitution Memorial Day, Greenery Day, Children's Day It's a busy week and not a busy week for game releases as a result in Japan But actually surprising, I do have one
6162162	6166746	On the Nintendo Switch, Ogu and the Secret Forest is coming out on the 29th in Japan.
6166827	6171151	And then MotoGP 25 is also out in Japan on the 30th.
6171611	6174454	So I don't know how some games snuck through there, but they did.
6174894	6177837	Just checking the PlayStation 5, just out of curiosity.
6177897	6180640	Yeah, that MotoGP 25 is also released in Japan.
6181160	6185144	I'm assuming the only reason that's coming out is because that's a worldwide release date.
6185704	6186785	Otherwise, they would probably...
6187907	6188727	DarkSakura
6199486	6200426	Oh, this and that.
6201127	6209669	So we have on the 28th, we have Badlands Crew for PC, Warfare Legacy Collection as well.
6210349	6213350	On PS5 on the 29th, we have Forza Horizon 5.
6214931	6221712	As well as the 29th, we have Subway Sim 2 for PC, Xbox Series, and PS5.
6222773	6226014	30th, Skin Deep for PC, Moroi for PC.

6240659	6242780	iOS and Android, Once Human.
6242860	6244201	That one doesn't have a date on it.
6244341	6246321	So I'm going to move on to other things.
6246421	6250003	Do have a date on May 1st because it's going to be May.
6251133	6254256	and Despilote, I guess is how it's pronounced.
6255117	6263183	PlayStation and Xbox Switch PC, Dig VR for PC and PSVR 2, Free Ride for PC.
6263544	6268468	On the second, Beyond Memories, Tales of the Heart for PC and Maze Mice for PC.
6270550	6270890	All right.
6271390	6273832	Still a pretty busy week in the non-Japan regions.
6274758	6274998	All right.
6275659	6276779	Well, that was it for news.
6277159	6282842	It was actually somewhat of a slow news week outside of everything that was going on with the switch and the other things we've brought up earlier in the show.
6283503	6287085	So this is the part where we go to the listener roundtable where we ask for your feedback.
6287705	6289046	We go to the mailbag every week.
6289106	6291267	Participate at OrangeZandrieta.com.
6291307	6292888	I don't think we had anything in there.
6293971	6297453	There was a bunch of shit You know what we do with shit?
6297954	6321409	Flush it That's right, all that stuff I do believe though, it just popped in in like the last 20 minutes Somebody, a kind listener has sent Loki has sent you a key You might already have this, I don't know But has sent you a key code for Minecraft stuff from McDonald's So there's a code in our mailbox for you I'll have to forward to you Alright, cool, yeah, I'll check it out
6322153	6324054	It was in the mailbox because I deleted everything.
6324154	6325275	It just came in.
6325335	6327256	Well, I'll forward it for my personal email.
6327356	6328316	It just came in at like 7.02.
6328416	6331318	So like within the last hour.
6331638	6333920	I didn't see anything like that show up in our mailbox.
6334180	6335861	Okay, maybe it got forwarded to my personal email.
6335921	6336221	I don't know.
6336661	6337862	Anyway, it doesn't matter.
6337942	6341164	They brought back the chicken strips at McDonald's though.
6341404	6341884	Oh, really?
6341904	6342704	So that's kind of cool.
6342844	6343365	Yeah, they're back.
6344602	6346583	They call them McCrispies now.
6347563	6348503	It's just the same thing.
6348963	6350984	If they cook them well enough.
6351224	6354265	Well, the one I had today, they overcooked them.
6354345	6355665	They were very dry.
6355785	6358026	But that can happen.
6358286	6361807	So were they McCrumbly instead of McCrispy?
6362541	6364343	Jack in the Box Del Taco
6377907	6378967	As long as Del Taco lives.
6397895	6398495	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6415101	6428335	and when when he came out uh he's like I must I have to go to a Taco Bell because like the nearest one is like way over here in Australia and I'm like no we're taking you to Del Taco and there were no spots
6430495	6431376	Jack in the Box
6447470	6450071	All kind of code violations until it finally just went away.
6450331	6450771	I really do.
6450811	6452331	And again, I'm not being paid to say it.
6452831	6459132	I really do think it's the best fast food because they have such a diverse menu that there's so many things you can get there.
6459512	6462573	Sure, you can think that they... Usually I'll say, oh, Jack in the Box.
6462613	6463173	I love Jack in the Box.
6463193	6466374	And somebody will instantly reply with, they have the shittiest tacos.
6466734	6467154	Fine.
6467214	6468154	Do you know there's like... They do.
6468314	6474796	Number one, tacos are like one thing on their menu of like 200 items because it completely caters to stoners.
6474836	6475956	Then order something else.
6476136	6476356	There's...
6477096	6477737	Lots of things.
6477977	6485063	They have better things, but I got really grossed out by their tacos when I could see how much grease was dripping off of them.
6485183	6486384	It was a river.
6486685	6488586	It's an empanada.
6488646	6489467	It's deep fried.
6489527	6489747	Anyway.
6494312	6497856	If I'm going to eat food so greasy it's going to make me sick, I'm going to go to Jim Boy's.
6497876	6499959	I was going to say Jim Boy's is the taco you eat.
6500019	6503304	If you don't care about your insides.
6503324	6510513	All right, let's get to Blue Sky because I did put a bleed up earlier and a lot of you were very good at responding to it.
6510533	6511014	So thank you.
6511694	6516297	I put a bleed up over on our Blue Sky, which is at orangelaundradio.com.
6516337	6519819	We're verified by domain name, so you just look for orangelaundradio.com.
6520279	6527103	And we asked on Blue Sky this week, for those of you that attempted a pre-order on Switch 2, how was that experience for you?
6527703	6531625	and for those of you that didn't pre-order the console, what made you a no or a not now?
6531686	6537909	So I wanted to include everybody and fully realize there's a lot of people that were a no or just can't do it right now.
6537989	6539210	So we wanted to hear from both sides.
6539690	6543273	So Dark Dead Sea starts us off saying, it all comes down to the money situation.
6543773	6547775	$4.99 is a pretty tall ask and the most we'll be paying for one of these this generation.
6548276	6553699	So mostly just crossing our fingers that somewhere we'll have one when early June rolls around and just split the cost of one then.
6554219	6559201	and hopefully down the line get a second one so we won't have to share one but we'll start with the one and go from there.
6559521	6571906	You know that's a really realistic perspective and I think part of the important reason for asking this question is that many of us need to realize that being able to just drop $500 on one of these is a privilege.
6572186	6576188	I mean it is not something that everybody is going to be able to afford out the gate.
6576648	6578949	I will never forget years ago
6580342	6581063	Thanks for watching!
6595658	6595938	Oh, hey.
6595978	6596098	Mm-hmm.
6622682	6624663	Gamer is one who games.
6625103	6625503	That's right.
6626083	6629184	It doesn't say one who games the PlayStation 50,000.
6629364	6630325	That's right.
6630765	6633106	Or it's one who games.
6633146	6633326	Yeah.
6633966	6638207	And in time, there will be secondhand versions of this and the price will come down and so forth.
6638728	6643129	As gaming enthusiasts, we have to talk about the latest and greatest because it's where the industry is going.
6643409	6649792	But you'll notice all of us, and maybe that's part of what draws some of you to our show, all of us have a soft spot for retro.
6650052	6650632	Like hard.
6650652	6650732	Yeah.
6651092	6652133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6667690	6670211	Also, not everybody wants to even if they can't.
6670231	6670631	That's right.
6671191	6673072	And you don't have to.
6674012	6682635	So Red Entertainment also is in the no camp saying not now as I didn't realistically think I'd be able to get one and I'm not apt to jump through hoops to get it.
6683195	6686776	Also, this statement could apply to any recent gaming console upon release.
6686836	6687157	That's true.
6687637	6689257	PlayStation 5s were impossible to get.
6689357	6691758	I didn't get a PlayStation 5 for years after the fact.
6692638	6694419	That doesn't make me any less of a gamer, I don't think.
6694721	6696221	By the time I could get one, I didn't care.
6696562	6697122	Yeah, right.
6697982	6704064	PodCulture replied to us on Blue Sky saying, I really want one, but got to get past the hailstorm damage to the house fix first.
6704124	6706004	Again, priorities, right?
6706165	6706645	Makes sense.
6707625	6708905	We have a lot of no's.
6709225	6712006	We have a lot of no's because Mike Deft says, I didn't pre-order.
6712366	6713747	Not that I don't want the console.
6714627	6716988	I think it's worth the price of the mission in the US.
6717548	6719949	But here's the problem is Mike Deft is in Mexico.
6721064	6728969	In Mexico, the Mario Kart World bundle being just over $750 is insane, and that's not even the tariffs.
6729349	6738915	That's because the distributor for anything Nintendo-related, Latamel, I guess is the company, they inflate the prices by a lot sometimes, but the Switch 2 prices really took the cake.
6739495	6743818	Either way, I'll just wait for when I can afford to get one, whether it's at launch or by the end of the year.
6743918	6745519	I'm not in a hurry to get it, so...
6746513	6749075	That's a very realistic perspective of not being in the U.S.
6749735	6750095	as well.
6750496	6759562	We heard from our old pal Megzi on Blue Sky who said, I fell asleep Wednesday night and completely missed the first round of pre-orders.
6760042	6762964	Then when I tried to pre-order through GameStop, the website crashed.
6763404	6770249	Luckily, I have a GameStop right by my apartment and a very chill boss, so I took a few hours of vacation from work to go wait in line in person.
6770709	6775572	It took a few hours waiting, but I got the pre-order plus a giant Sonic plush.
6776893	6799373	and I know Megzi is a big fan of the Sonic movies recently I think Megzi and Tiger Claw have a lot in common in that department uh so I love that Megzi got uh their Sonic 3 plushie is is wonderful so uh great thanks it's good to hear from you Megzi I hope you're doing well uh we also have okay this is from Roto 13 on Blue Sky but I fucking love the name called the shitty Gatsby
6801483	6801843	That's great.
6801923	6814089	Not the great Gatsby, but their cousin, the shitty Gatsby, who says, I stood in line with 100 people for hours at GameStop, but apparently I didn't need to because they still had pre-orders available as of late this morning.
6814149	6815890	Yeah, I heard that a lot of GameStops.
6816470	6819512	So those of you that still want one, call GameStop.
6820072	6821133	You might be surprised.
6822153	6827154	GameStop has a tracker up here in Canada, and a lot of stores still have at least a few left.
6828795	6836557	Vigetto EX, another name I haven't seen in a long time, good to hear from you, says, had one in my Target cart, but couldn't check out all night long due to errors.
6836777	6838477	So somebody that experienced what Loki had.
6838878	6841698	Best Buy silently kicked me out of its queue multiple times.
6842198	6843179	Walmart worked out.
6843339	6846580	At some point, it offered me the chance to buy and bought no problem.
6846980	6850761	Managed to get a second next day via GameStop's dumpster fire sale.
6850981	6851121	Yep.
6852858	6853518	Oh, JoshBet.
6853538	6854599	I like that it's a dumpster fire.
6854619	6855199	That's right.
6855659	6858080	Always a pleasure to hear from JoshBet over on Blue Sky who says,
6877347	6884654	My friend was less lucky and had to pay attention for several hours and multiple websites broke and deleted his payment information, address, etc.
6885034	6886355	So he had to keep actively trying.
6886715	6888117	It even refused a payment option.
6888597	6890559	He finally got one after two plus hours.
6890899	6892220	Was surprised there were still some there.
6893283	6896285	Yeah, so apparently it might have gotten a little easier.
6896325	6897105	I don't know what happened there.
6897986	6899526	We heard from Coral Rose.
6899627	6900287	Hello, Ms.
6900347	6904269	Coral Rose, who says, I tried at Target and their site was quite broken.
6904749	6905690	I got to place an order.
6905750	6907831	It was canceled a minute or so later.
6908311	6910793	I also tried Best Buy and was successful there.
6911293	6915575	I hope there's at least one more round of preorders like Sony did with the 30th anniversary PlayStation 5.
6916015	6916636	Much nicer.
6917813	6920616	We heard from Markito over on Blue Sky who said, Yep.
6937768	6938589	I wish I knew too.
6939650	6940290	Because of reason.
6957685	6958706	Target was a nightmare.
6958806	6960387	Got it in the cart but could never check out.
6960687	6961868	Kept getting error after error.
6961988	6963570	The only thing I snagged there was the camera.
6963950	6967232	Walmart and Best Buy were mostly a matter of waiting around for something to happen.
6967693	6972516	One Walmart window let me through to the product page but would give me an error when I tried to add it to the cart.
6972877	6976079	Kept trying for the entire 10 minute window they gave you but nothing.
6976519	6978201	After that, everything went pretty smoothly.
6979696	6982898	Our pal Slaggy McWaggy from the Gamebuoy.org podcast.
6982938	6983419	Hello.
6983999	6986140	And listen to Gamebuoy.org if you're not already.
6986661	6991904	Says, dealt with target site breaking, got one to go through, and it immediately got canceled.
6992304	6996067	Walmart went pretty smoothly and was able to get a secure one, but not for launch day delivery.
6996507	7000990	Tried on Best Buy, got kicked out of the queue, but it ended up working out, so I canceled my Walmart one.
7001511	7009116	Walmart's process was by far the smoothest, but Best Buy was my preferred retailer, so I could get it in person, and I'm not a fan of the others for reasons.
7009796	7014280	So I'm glad it worked out the way it did and consider myself very fortunate that I was able to get one.
7015220	7023667	And then OhMyDolly, which is Dolly Partner, says, I guess I was one of the lucky ones.
7023787	7025088	I managed to pre-order one.
7025348	7032034	That actually reminds me, I took a picture of a Dolly mural downtown that I was going to bleat out to Dolly Partner.
7032074	7033134	This reminds me I need to do it.
7033595	7033835	Anyway...
7035458	7035878	Yeah, I will.
7036478	7037859	I guess I was one of the lucky ones.
7037999	7043320	I managed to pre-order one from Target right at 12.01am, and so far it hasn't been cancelled.
7043840	7050021	I've seen lots of people saying they've got cancellation emails, so I've been avoiding checking my email, but I do keep an eye on the Target app.
7050701	7054702	Also, I've been feeling pretty guilty for using them because of all the evil shit they've been doing.
7056163	7057883	I get that, but like...
7061121	7063942	There's a lot of problematic shit going on in this country right now.
7064442	7067262	And ultimately, it's because of the guy in charge.
7067823	7069223	And I get really frustrated.
7069363	7072284	I understand if people want to boycott Target or whatever they're boycotting.
7072404	7075044	And again, I'm glad people called it out.
7075084	7077065	I think Walmart has just as many problematic issues.
7077425	7082826	And I'm sure there is something wrong with Best Buy that we just aren't hearing about on a mass scale, but we'll hear eventually.
7083226	7090408	I'm sure we'll hear about it then too because it just feels, you know, again, we're living in a there's no ethical consumption in capitalism type of era.
7090988	7098813	But, I mean, I do get frustrated when I hear people that are screaming, you need to boycott Target, and then they didn't vote in the last election.
7099853	7118105	Because the easiest way to have prevented a worldwide backlash, or not, I'm sorry, not worldwide, that was the wrong word, my apologies, a nationwide, which sometimes feels like the world and the trickle-down effect things have, a nationwide backlash, or whatever you want to call it, on DEI,
7119184	7127127	is because of who got elected and all these executive orders and all this bullshit that they're putting out there threatening to pull all this stuff because heaven forbid.
7127147	7129248	Yeah, exactly.
7129308	7134491	I guess maybe that's why worldwide was the first word that came to my mind, even though let's not kid ourselves.
7134531	7140193	This is a problem of who people elected or were voting for.
7140833	7144115	The time to have fought back against this was at the voting booth.
7144875	7148276	But y'all were finding problems with Kamala.
7148296	7152217	Y'all wanted to bring these problems to Kamala as if the needle could have never been moved.
7152537	7155778	Y'all wanted to say she was an imperfect candidate, therefore she should win.
7156338	7156998	And now here we are.
7158959	7160479	Congratulations, you played yourselves.
7160579	7162080	I hope y'all learned your lesson for next time.
7162640	7171162	And I just, I'm sorry, but like, and again, I understand, I respect why people feel the need to boycott Target.
7171742	7173403	It's not going to fix the problems in this country.
7179815	7182316	We did get some last minute answers here.
7182996	7185677	And yeah, SGO100Matt says, but her laugh was strange.
7186077	7196039	And I also fully realized she was the best candidate that could have possibly happened in 100 days.
7196439	7200040	47 has been in office longer than Kamala Harris ran for office.
7200841	7202121	Put that into perspective a little bit.
7204540	7205100	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7233929	7242768	Congress could get rid of the tariff tomorrow Congress could fix a lot of the problems with the DEI backlash tomorrow but they won't
7244894	7248737	Orange Right says, I ended up getting lucky at Best Buy so far anyway.
7248917	7255621	I managed to reload Best Buy at the exact right time, clicked the checkout button, got in line, waited for 40 minutes, and eventually it went through.
7256581	7259743	And then I tried other stores at the same time to triple my chances.
7260164	7268229	Target kept giving me errors until it sold out, and I got out of line at Walmart because I heard just getting a non-bundle would check out normally, which yes, sold out.
7269873	7271877	Thank you all for your responses on social media.
7271897	7274602	I need to ask those questions more often because we had a very nice response.
7274743	7276226	So thank you all on Blue Sky.
7276246	7276847	I appreciate it.
7277488	7279552	But what's up with me having to do all the reading now?
7279592	7280854	This is supposed to be Jamie's job.
7282687	7309069	because it's not the mail but it no but no it is and you know I'm just giving you shit but it's one of those things where it's like wow we really are getting away from a lot of these forms of media it really is turning into short form social media it's just another example of that so anyway all right well one person will still turn to here is Loki I've decided I'm sorry I made a decision okay if someone wants to know my thoughts on something they can fucking ask me and I will tell them
7310745	7317492	What are your thoughts on Diet Coke vs. Diet Pepsi?
7317512	7318253	Diet Pepsi, all the way.
7318273	7318453	Fuck Coke.
7330936	7332497	All right.
7333298	7334399	As I drink a Coke Zero.
7334479	7337161	But in my defense, this is one of those orange cream Coke Zeros.
7337241	7337861	They're really good.
7338041	7339102	Those aren't very good either.
7339342	7340523	I like the Oreo ones.
7341904	7342184	All right.
7343145	7343345	Oh, yeah.
7343365	7344626	The Oreo ones are fucking great.
7344886	7345767	I wish they'd bring those back.
7345847	7348289	Shadow, your job is in jeopardy now.
7348409	7350810	Do not call the boss a heathen.
7351971	7352251	All right.
7354293	7355514	Terrible soda all you want.
7356437	7356797	That's right.
7356837	7357817	More terrible soda for you.
7357877	7358157	All right.
7359018	7361198	Let's go to the boss of last minute stories.
7361258	7362458	Loki, anything for us tonight?
7364599	7367320	Loki, you're muted because I see the mouth moving, but nothing's happening.
7367380	7374201	I was going to say, yeah, we're on top of all of the most critical news when it comes to modern consoles.
7375281	7383924	So now I have to tell you that your brand new Wii system, unfortunately, the Homebrew channel is no longer to be in development.
7384144	7385004	I mean, I get it.
7385164	7385284	It's
7386397	7389979	Several months or years ago.
7390440	7402888	But essentially, it's been revealed that apparently threading an OS implementation in one of the libraries was stolen.
7403849	7415977	And the authors of LiboGC, they didn't just steal proprietary Nintendo code, but also saw fit to steal open source RTOS and remove all attribution and copyright information.
7417578	7418258	Who would have thought?
7418379	7422402	In the piracy world, there's people willing to steal things.
7422902	7428246	Especially we know there was some big leaks out of Nintendo not long ago, so it kind of adds up a little bit.
7429887	7430527	The plot thickens.
7431721	7431961	All right.
7432681	7436083	Well, if that's it, then we will say thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
7436123	7437203	Thank you all for being here tonight.

7450970	7452210	Tell a friend or two about the show.
7452250	7455892	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7455952	7462396	Thank you to all the voices we heard tonight, whether through chat, whether through Blue Sky, whether through Carrier Pigeon, or however you're interacting with this show.
7462716	7463676	Thank you so much for that.
7463856	7466318	Whether through shipped Commodore 64s, which I still can't believe.
7466338	7467078	Thank you so much for that.
7467838	7475562	A nice five-star review goes a long way as well, either on Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, wherever you're finding this show.
7475923	7477183	All of that goes a very long way.
7477243	7478124	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
7478804	7480285	With that, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
7480646	7481626	Jamie, are you streaming tonight?
7482227	7482747	I actually don't know.
7482767	7484548	Yeah, I am for a little bit.
7485269	7489292	I am going to drink some Scottish soda on stream unless somebody drank it already.
7490833	7494215	Would you like to give us your final thoughts then?
7494475	7495096	I'm tired.
7496365	7502810	I'm tired Tired of love uninspired I'm tired of love uninspired
7527308	7527989	That's right.
7529191	7529511	Let's see.
7529571	7533937	My final thought tonight is... Oh, I am going on a quick trip next weekend.
7533977	7536220	I'm going to be running to the show last minute.
7536300	7541267	So, by the way, I forgot to tell you and Jamie, the show is going to be very last minute next week because I'm going to LA.
7541788	7542769	Because, because, because...
7543410	7545131	We're going to see Kylie Minogue again.
7545691	7547272	I saw Kylie Minogue on Tuesday.
7548413	7549294	It was such a good show.
7549414	7551655	It was such a good show, especially for an arena show.
7552356	7553536	I had the best time.
7554197	7555457	I love Kylie.
7555898	7557098	Yeah, she's great.
7558299	7559500	What's better than seeing her once?
7559580	7560220	Seeing her twice.
7560400	7562882	One of my friends was like, I want to go to LA to see her again.
7563062	7565764	I was like, so do I. We're going to go.
7565804	7567605	We're going to LA to see her again.
7567665	7570447	Then we're thinking about going to the Universal Fan Nights.
7571147	7573308	because I want to see the Star Trek thing.
7574549	7577771	And my friend that is meeting us in LA is from the Star Trek cruise.
7578171	7579952	So we might go Star Trek together.
7580493	7581353	So we're going to do that.
7581573	7582554	The concert's Friday.
7582574	7587377	We're going to do Friday, Saturday, and then drive home Sunday in a rush and get back in time for the show.
7587557	7588037	That's the plan.
7589838	7590119	All right.
7590519	7590999	Sounds busy.
7591179	7597965	Yeah, it's going to be busy, but I'm still living my life like I'm in my mid-20s, and one of these days I'm probably going to be very unhappy with that decision.
7598005	7599946	But for now, I'm having a great time.
7600366	7602728	So until then, have a great week, everybody.
7602788	7604830	We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7605150	7605931	Have a wonderful week.
