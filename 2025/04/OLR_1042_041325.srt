1
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:11,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Writing is hard, I know this.

2
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:17,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a writer outside of these intros, but the sub-headline for our lead story written by a video games writer or editor was a big miss.

3
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:22,008
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mario Maker is stuck between a thwomp and a green shell when it comes to the current tariff mess.

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So close, yet so far, blue shell!

5
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:29,830
[SPEAKER_04]: One could argue green because money, but green shells don't instill fear in Mario Kart racers like the blue shell does.

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess which story is the lead?

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Start your night now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:44,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason, it's a red shell if you look at the stock market right now.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi.

11
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:50,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:52,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:59,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live once again tonight, April the 13th of 2025 with episode number 1042 of our show.

14
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:03,653
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and with me as always, Tech Master Loki.

15
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:05,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

16
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Loki.

17
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:06,514
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

18
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:07,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

19
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:08,551
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

20
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Ninja Turtles in the background.

21
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:17,236
[SPEAKER_02]: This this has to be the recent game because I noticed April and Splinter in there, which was not the old arcade game.

22
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:19,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

23
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:19,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

24
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Shredder's Revenge was fun, though.

25
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:25,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play that at some party not that long ago and finally got around to playing it.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:35,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's definitely reminiscent of, you know, being a roundtable pizza, putting quarters in that old ass coin machine with April O'Neill on the side in the very 90s hair.

27
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.

28
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:42,208
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so funny because there's a lot of these games that are trying to be homage to the arcade.

29
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:44,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get arcade versions of them?

30
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:51,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Scott Pilgrim Saves the World or whatever versus the world would be a great one to see as an arcade beat-em-up.

31
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much anything by Tribute is...

32
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:03,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Great fodder for arcade ports like this, for example, should be an arcade port.

33
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:11,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, looking at DarkSakura's segment, which by the way, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, they're a little under the weather.

34
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:17,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Had a 14-hour marathon stream yesterday, I think, as a little bit of an early birthday.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy early birthday to DarkSakura, but she wasn't feeling too great earlier and I think had to miss some of her other commitments and I don't know if that's

36
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Stamina or Stamina combined with other things going on.

37
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:37,671
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever the case may be, I hope DarkSakura feels much better and will join us again next week just in time for her.

38
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just after her birthday, actually.

39
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:41,173
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll still get to say hello.

40
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:43,975
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura will be back with us next week.

41
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,056
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

42
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:15,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello to you all in chat as well, including Questbuster, who says Tribute Games, who did Shredder's Revenge, is also doing Cosmic Invasion.

43
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hyped about that, too.

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:27,417
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, if you want to join the chat, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

45
00:03:27,777 --> 00:03:44,219
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way some housekeeping I want to get here done at the top regarding the Voice of Geeks Network and our shows you know unfortunately during COVID and you know some of the the ramp up to that we we lost a good chunk of our lineup here at VOG Network but I'm very excited to announce one of the shows that some

46
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have thought it's sunsetted.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Has not.

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And is back after a multi-year hiatus.

49
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Big shout out to our friends over at Gamebuoy.org, a video game podcast.

50
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:04,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, this is every time I say Gamebuoy.org, this is where you have to say in a very high-pitched voice, Gamebuoy.org, a video game podcast.

51
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:06,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Slidekick does on the show.

52
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's try that again.

53
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:11,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to the Gamebuoy.org podcast.

54
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:13,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, bye.

55
00:04:16,854 --> 00:04:17,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, then you say it.

56
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:18,736
[SPEAKER_02]: You say welcome back.

57
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:19,177
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it.

58
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back to GameBooey.org.

59
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,801
GameBooey.org.

60
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:25,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you got it.

61
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:25,582
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

62
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so a big welcome back to them.

63
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,445
[SPEAKER_02]: They just put out a new episode.

64
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:33,928
[SPEAKER_02]: The Switch 2 is making people come out of hiding.

65
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:43,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Another podcast that I always really loved with one of our listeners that's frequently on our show, Delvin, heads up Video Game Realness.

66
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:46,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned at the end of the last show, they came back for a reunion episode too.

67
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:47,497
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four episodes.

68
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,758
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

69
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

70
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:19,922
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get all the latest information about Gameboy.org and their links and all that good stuff over at the Voice Geeks Network or on their own website, which I think you would know by now as Gameboy.org.

71
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:33,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're available on all the major podcast platforms as well as the links over at VOGnetwork.com and in our Discord server that pushes all those updates, but not with a ping because we know the ping is annoying.

72
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have an optional channel that you can just watch.

73
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:35,988
[SPEAKER_02]: It's...

74
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,989
[SPEAKER_02]: VOG Network.com slash Discord.

75
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:53,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, since we're talking about Switch 2 and, you know, all the podcasts coming back to celebrate the Switch 2, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is, of course, is going to be a follow-up to everything last week.

76
00:05:53,193 --> 00:06:00,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, Loki, do you remember at the end of last week's show, we said something to the effect of, you know what, in seven more days...

77
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,616
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to flip-flop a hundred times.

78
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still not going to have the answers as to how much this thing is going to cost.

79
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:08,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

80
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:09,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what, Mimi?

81
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:10,658
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.

82
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:14,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it still can't figure it out what's happening.

83
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:14,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still going.

84
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Even today, there's stuff switching up.

85
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, I know you got a story on this, too.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're getting Canada into it.

87
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,222
[SPEAKER_02]: God, we've been picking on them unnecessarily.

88
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry to our Canadian friends who are listening.

89
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:29,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

90
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate some all-dressed chips today, Your Honor.

91
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:45,279
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like no plan, and you have someone with dementia making the plans, and so that's why the plans are all over the place, and nobody's on the same page about anything, and it keeps changing.

92
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

93
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't spill that tea, it was choke on my coffee.

94
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:52,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang, Loki.

95
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:57,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, because it's just confusing enough.

96
00:06:57,345 --> 00:07:01,088
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to figure also, too, with all these changes in tariffs.

97
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:06,252
[SPEAKER_05]: So companies, like corporations, the ones that you're either...

98
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,290
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

99
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:34,011
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, their production or like somehow get product from China to Taiwan to then import from there.

100
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:38,934
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is with the tariff numbers changing constantly, you can't make a plan.

101
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:48,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also like, you know, the whole point of bringing, you know, putting tariffs out there was to try to bring more manufacturing to the United States.

102
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:54,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't just happen like with a Thanos snap and then all of a sudden there's like factories and workers and everything.

103
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,786
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years to set that up.

104
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:58,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dumb.

105
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:09,956
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, so yes, the good news is that it's possible that... Now we don't... Computers are exempt from tariffs is the latest flavor of the month.

106
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:10,837
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:08:10,997 --> 00:08:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But does that include Switch?

108
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:12,298
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're not.

109
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:15,211
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not exempt.

110
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:15,892
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.

111
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you it's changing already.

112
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:21,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I clearly consulted with Ms.

113
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleo incorrectly on what the fuck he was thinking.

114
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

115
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:33,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, yes, it's nice to think that they might be, but then that was reversed again today.

117
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:39,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they've walked back tariff exemptions on electronics.

118
00:08:40,134 --> 00:09:03,944
[SPEAKER_05]: so you know even though they said that that was going to be the case it says they've walked it back now and there's supposed to be more news coming on Monday you know for for them to this uh tank the stock market and then change course and then boost the stock market again because it's a big rug pull you know uh bait and switch nonsense with the stock market now because we can do that is he gonna name a day after it is it gonna be you know Tara what

119
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to celebrate Tariff Clarity Day.

120
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a huge day.

121
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge day full of clarity.

122
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:12,647
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be celebrated.

123
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:17,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge, wonderful things are going to happen.

124
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:23,432
[SPEAKER_05]: We are aware that he is a moron and the whole administration is stupid and everything is just on fire.

125
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally the Emperor wears new clothes.

126
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It is literally the Emperor wears new clothes.

127
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:41,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally we have the whole medical report that was released that they do every year and they're telling us that God King is the healthiest human being on the face of the earth and also has won golf tournaments.

128
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That was on his medical report for some reason.

129
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,381
[SPEAKER_02]: His BMI is 28.

130
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's just like, you know, he's so smart and the best of everything.

131
00:09:52,079 --> 00:10:03,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there is someone who likes him, hate listening to this podcast right now because, you know, social media loves to push things, and just wishing we would shut the fuck up about politics already.

132
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,429
[SPEAKER_02]: But guess what, y'all?

133
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,750
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is...

134
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:07,412
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:29,369
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:10:49,670 --> 00:11:08,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now it shows there's some reports saying that data showing the exports of game systems from Vietnam right now, apparently they've been stockpiling units in the United States, probably planning for these tariffs to happen eventually.

137
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:13,089
[SPEAKER_05]: So get them over here before they're affected by the tariffs, and then that way you have...

138
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:20,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Product to sell that you can still sell at a somewhat low enough price without having to lose money on those systems.

139
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:26,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rumor is right now that they've stockpiled at least like a million systems over here in the United States.

140
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

141
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:32,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, who knows what's actually going to be tariff wise because it's kind of gone back and forth.

142
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:37,964
[SPEAKER_05]: They've already halted pre-orders on the system, which were originally going to launch on the 9th.

143
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,806
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada's had their pre-orders halted as well.

145
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:08,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Besties.

146
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:09,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

147
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried, y'all.

148
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:13,221
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried.

149
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:15,924
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, we tried.

150
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:29,816
[SPEAKER_05]: The launch date is still June 5th, but right now, pre-orders haven't begun yet because I don't know what that's going to look like exporting to Canada from maybe the United States or what the case may be.

151
00:12:30,197 --> 00:12:30,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I would

152
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:32,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure what's going to happen there.

153
00:12:52,618 --> 00:13:04,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Until very recently, it was quite fucking normal for trucks to take things from harbors in other countries and take them into Mexico and Canada without fucking major issue.

154
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:14,545
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, you know, everything is subject to what side of the bed a certain person wakes up on or what a certain news channel he happens to be watching says.

155
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:15,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's...

156
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:17,287
[SPEAKER_02]: The World We Live In Now

157
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:48,588
[SPEAKER_02]: and QuestBusters pointing out board game makers and those using crowdfunding have been writing grim accounts ranging from delaying product to pivoting to things like card games just to stay afloat because they just have no idea what the bones will say the next day.

158
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that, the bones.

159
00:13:50,471 --> 00:14:09,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, considering what their opinion is and a lot of the opinion of the administration is with this whole masculinity in the United States, because everybody, they all think that the men in the United States should be working in factories and that they're more happy working a manual labor job.

160
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:14,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course they're going to say that because they deported all the people that were working those fields and everything.

161
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they want to bring back, was it coal jobs?

162
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally, like, move us back.

163
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:26,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, just, hey, we could, you know, become a leader in business and trade and all this stuff and really cutting edge stuff.

164
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, let's make coal.

165
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's power AI with coal.

166
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:32,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's great.

167
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:38,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me started on the AI thing, because this will become a political podcast if I go down that road, because that's a whole other...

168
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

169
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: DigitalTrends.com

170
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The Confusion Around $90 Switch 2 Games

171
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:37,882
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

172
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: um yeah there's still some issues though price wise like and I understand that $90 isn't the price point the other thing I've been seeing going around lately um also as a clickbait kind of headline saying there's you know $90 for uh for a game that's essentially eight years old which was The Legend of Zelda sure um you know and uh Tears of the Kingdom and um

173
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:31,280
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

174
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:57,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Which then, you know, they say, well, to get the full experience, which is what you should be getting eight years down the road.

175
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they should probably throw that in there.

176
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:01,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an additional $20.

177
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:08,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how they get up to $90 for what is essentially an older Zelda game that is...

178
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,408
[SPEAKER_05]: mildly better on the Switch too.

179
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:28,517
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Loki, I understand that there's a certain expectation in this gaming industry that after so many years you get that game of the year edition that has everything, or especially when it comes to a new console, the game that has everything all in one that comes out for usually a lower price.

180
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's Nintendo fanboys out there that'll defend them to the death and defend even this too, but I've got to ask y'all a very difficult question.

181
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:43,889
[SPEAKER_02]: If I replaced the words Breath of the Wild with Elder Scrolls Skyrim...

182
00:17:45,322 --> 00:18:11,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Which absolutely is going to get a Switch 2 release Don't fucking kid yourself Absolutely will get a Switch 2 release But the difference will be Skyrim will come with all of that DLC and everything Maybe it'll be $70, but at least it'll have everything God, they're foolish if they do it, but they might And at least we know it'll go on sale relatively quick But if I were to say Skyrim instead of Breath of the Wild Would you defend it just as much?

183
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Skyrim is also a great game.

184
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have to compare apples to oranges.

185
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:21,664
[SPEAKER_02]: We can acknowledge that both Skyrim and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild are great games.

186
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you defend Bethesda?

187
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:28,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you defend Microsoft if Skyrim were to release this for $70 with no DLC?

188
00:18:31,408 --> 00:18:37,330
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Mats asks, is the DLC included with the Expansion Plus DLC?

189
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that unknown as well?

190
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the DLC is available because the Switch 1 DLC was available through the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass.

191
00:18:52,094 --> 00:19:00,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, yeah, they're going to try to get you to buy that and get the additional DLCs and everything, but like...

192
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,381
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

193
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:48,654
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially they've made their money off it that's why Skyrim includes all of its DLC with the game because it's made its money off of that game for years now and now that I think about it they already announced a third party front Street Fighter 6 was already announced to have all the season one stuff included basically like the game will catch everybody up to where Street Fighter 6 is at with all its DLC which is how you know that's going to be a $70 release because it's going to have everything in it but Street Fighter 6 for the Switch 2 will have

194
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of all the ketchup stuff in it.

195
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,369
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not done with Street Fighter 6 yet, so there will be more, but...

196
00:19:54,313 --> 00:20:03,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and if you look at, too, like, even with some of the other Switch 1 games that are getting a Switch 2 version, essentially, they're adding stuff to those.

197
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:06,023
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not just doing, like, the graphical updates as well.

198
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:08,145
[SPEAKER_05]: They're adding content to the games.

199
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:11,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the whole stuff with Mario Party was getting a whole new section of the game.

200
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,611
[SPEAKER_05]: With, I'm trying to think what the other one was.

201
00:20:14,711 --> 00:20:16,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, was it Kirby or something like that?

202
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Was getting, like, more DLC or more, like, stuff to go along with it.

203
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:24,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda is getting slightly better visuals and it'll probably run a little bit smoother.

204
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's not... I guess you can download... I don't know if it's part of the app or not.

205
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:35,230
[SPEAKER_02]: The iPhone, excuse me, the phone, mobile phone, Android iPhone app, the little map on your phone.

206
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not part of it, though.

207
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:38,853
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was something they were... That's not part of the expansion.

208
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a thing that they're gonna make.

209
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:44,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought that was part of the Switch 2 specific version.

210
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:45,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.

211
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it is as far as tracking stuff, but once again, that's not included with it.

212
00:20:51,556 --> 00:21:00,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a separate... I guess my drag name is Misinformation, and I'm part of the problem, because again, we don't really have clarity on a lot of this.

213
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

214
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:11,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... I don't like the idea of that, but then again, I already have these games, so it's like a $10 upgrade if I'm going to do those.

215
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:12,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

216
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

217
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:24,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess... At least for Zelda.

218
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,725
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for Zelda.

219
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:26,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

220
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:32,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice, but it's... Yeah, how far... It's gonna be interesting to see what the long-term plan on that whole thing is.

221
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:38,314
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we need the system to come out at a reasonable price first before I think any of these bridges can be crossed.

222
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm telling you, if they release that system more than $500, I'm not getting one.

223
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:46,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna wait this whole stupid tariff thing out.

224
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

225
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:51,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

226
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:52,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

227
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:55,224
[SPEAKER_02]: SJ100Matt says, it's annoying that they've known what the console looks like.

228
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:59,745
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made the console and stockpiled it for months, but these easy details are annoyingly absent.

229
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:06,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I give them some credit that the price stuff is really hard to figure out because there has to be the sustainability.

230
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:09,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, they have them stockpiled, but they need to sustain throughout the holidays.

231
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,331
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ironic.

232
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:13,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have said something like this last week.

233
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:19,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit ironic that Nintendo is known for their gigantic hardware supply issues and have been for a long time.

234
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:24,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually trying to do something about it with Switch 2 and they might get screwed anyway.

235
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: That, like, once those stockpiles and the warehouses are gone, there's not going to be any more for a bit.

236
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:30,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless, I don't know.

237
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how the world we live in, I guess.

238
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:40,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, speaking of stockpiling, I heard a rumor, and I don't know if it's true or not, I heard a rumor that Apple to get around, because again, I...

239
00:22:41,551 --> 00:23:10,983
[SPEAKER_02]: at least until there's the on again off again with technology but at least what I had heard before the off switch was pulled then back to on what I had heard was that they were going to move a bunch of phones from China to India where they have a presence and then move them from India to the US and I don't know like again I don't know the 4D chess with that if that's actually something they can do or how that works yeah they can that's what I heard they were doing with phones is they were moving them to India first

240
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:21,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and that's why there's a lot of companies out there that are trying to figure out what their move is as far as moving product around the world and importing it from a different place to circumvent higher stuff.

241
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:31,371
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, if they keep changing all of this, especially if the administration hears that, oh yeah, they're not in good favor with Apple, which...

242
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:32,413
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not.

243
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:41,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they are in good favor with them, because I think that Tim Cook was one of the people he invited to the inauguration stuff and donated money.

244
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:50,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever the case may be, let's just say that somehow he pisses them off, and they want to get around, you know, they want to get back at him.

245
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they'll just increase the tariffs on India for...

246
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:56,434
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason.

247
00:23:56,794 --> 00:23:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because they feel like it.

248
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:00,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress could end this tomorrow.

249
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put that out.

250
00:24:02,296 --> 00:24:03,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress could end this tomorrow.

251
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:10,659
[SPEAKER_02]: They could severely hamper the ability because the whole thing is being made on these emergency declarations that are questionable at best.

252
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And Congress could end that emergency declaration tomorrow.

253
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But they won't.

254
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:20,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the chat says that Congress doesn't have the balls.

255
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:20,103
100%.

256
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:29,009
[SPEAKER_02]: But some in the Senate are starting to waver a little bit, which I think is why the off switch got pulled in the first place.

257
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, you know, keep those phone calls up.

258
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:40,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that, you know, directed town hall anger up because at least in the Senate, it's starting to get heard.

259
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:41,898
[SPEAKER_02]: There was pressure there.

260
00:24:41,998 --> 00:24:44,400
[SPEAKER_02]: They were getting close to that 60 votes they need to break a...

261
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Filibuster and all that.

262
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:50,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

263
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else to say about the Switch 2 tariffs today?

264
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:57,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will change by the time people hear this podcast.

265
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:58,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll change tomorrow.

266
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be changing tomorrow because originally it was that allegedly Tim Cook or somebody had talked to the administration and said, hey, we need an exemption on these electronics because this is going to be ridiculous for a lot of the stuff that we're doing.

267
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:14,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And

268
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:18,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that made the Trump administration look kind of weak.

269
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, they're like, wait a second, no, we can't look weak.

270
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,414
[SPEAKER_05]: We never said we're going to stop doing that.

271
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:26,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

272
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:28,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so hard to follow.

273
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:33,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's intentional because they're doing other horrible things at the same time.

274
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:44,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like 4D horrible chess with human rights violations and all sorts of gutting everything and just literally making a mess of everything.

275
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:54,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, we'll be back in seven days to talk about the latest to see if Nintendo wants to commit to a pre-order date or not.

276
00:25:54,579 --> 00:25:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite frankly, I don't blame them until there's a lot more clarity on this whole thing.

277
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:00,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

278
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:07,370
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, Switch or otherwise.

279
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

280
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:10,229
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

281
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, you know, Minecraft.

282
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:14,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing lots of Minecraft.

283
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,472
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a stream day on Saturday.

284
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:18,773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I streamed for a couple hours then.

285
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty fun.

286
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And just put out another episode.

287
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I have five weeks in a row now.

288
00:26:24,596 --> 00:26:28,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably will have six here pretty soon because I have enough footage for another episode again.

289
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:33,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just working on the SMP stuff.

290
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Still chucking away at my industrial district that is...

291
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:40,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty close to done, I think.

292
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,722
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot more I can really build.

293
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:49,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to have to start actually getting to building the big game that's this season.

294
00:26:50,889 --> 00:27:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, other than that Bellaltro bit, I did end up ordering... I'm not really into this scene too much, but there's all these Android retro game handhelds.

295
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:16,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically emulation portable systems that run a bunch of these things, emulate everything from as old as you can think to... I think this one does up to...

296
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:33,584
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2 it even does some Switch and like Wii and stuff like that it doesn't really go beyond that you can do like PlayStation 3 sort of and some of the Xbox stuff if you switch it over to Linux but I got a I ordered a Retro Pocket 3

297
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Lip 2, which is a really nice Android device.

298
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got an OLED screen on it and stuff.

299
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a clamshell, almost like a 3DS or something like that.

300
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to try to load that up with a bunch of games and do that, because honestly...

301
00:27:53,356 --> 00:28:14,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep buying like retro games for my Nintendo and I'm just I'm never gonna play them because I have to hook that all up and everything and so this is just easier for me plus you can get all the like botted games that people make and stuff and I think it'd be fun for my son to play and all that type of thing nice plus screw Nintendo I'm gonna emulate whatever the fuck I want

302
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Ironically, I was playing with Nintendo emulators this week, too.

303
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing.

304
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:23,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I played DuckTales, the classic NES version for no particular reason.

305
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to play it.

306
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why do you need a reason to play that game?

307
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:26,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the best.

308
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was playing that a little bit.

309
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,035
[SPEAKER_02]: So good times.

310
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, before I take over anything else for your game week, Loki.

311
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:35,389
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was it.

312
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Then continuing on with my gaming week, I've been playing a little more Final Fantasy XIV.

313
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:46,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally unlocked that dungeon in the patch after two and a half weeks, which would tell you kind of where my head is at with that game right now.

314
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:50,442
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just I haven't really been as into it as weeks past.

315
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:54,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I have a new Diablo 4 patch to look forward to, though, in a few weeks.

316
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:57,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Although some of the hardcore people really don't care for that patch either.

317
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:58,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.

318
00:28:58,228 --> 00:28:58,568
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

319
00:28:58,609 --> 00:28:59,409
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens there.

320
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

321
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:00,810
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

322
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:21,667
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

323
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.

324
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

325
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:50,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so four of us were actually playing all at the same time, and it felt great to play that game again.

326
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,572
[SPEAKER_02]: We were playing some other GameCube games too.

327
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:54,873
[SPEAKER_02]: This may surprise you.

328
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:59,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never played, somehow, never played Kirby Air Ride before.

329
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:10,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the sequel was announced last week, I didn't have a lot to say about it, but I actually got to play the GameCube version of that game this last week, and I was like, oh...

330
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:11,625
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

331
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually played this vehicle in the game that like every time you hit the A button, you actually fully stopped.

332
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you had to like aim yourself and you go back up to full speed.

333
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of neat, like a little slingshot kind of way to play.

334
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I enjoyed Air Ride.

335
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:47,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, runs so good with four people playing all at the same time.

336
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't notice the frame drops or anything like that.

337
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:54,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, the GameCube was really underrated, I think, but...

338
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:56,133
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

339
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,285
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

340
00:31:39,700 --> 00:32:09,020
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wanted to say I don't want to say too much about it but one of them is in game dev and I wanted to be like oh you should check this game out because I think this is fucking brilliant and like you know it deserves to be bigger than it is and he played it and he said yeah this is really this is really fun this is a really funny or like not funny but like really like engaging type of concept so um it was good to get that validation by the way speaking of game devs another random thing I did this week I actually went to a game dev meetup on Thursday and I wasn't sure if I was going to go my friend invited me

341
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,181
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, well, should I go?

342
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a game dev but they actually were quite welcoming and it was nice to... It also is very nice to be able to say, oh yeah, I'm in Guinness Book of Video Gaming Records because that kind of buys you like the I'm different from the other podcasts like right out the gate type of thing.

343
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:31,313
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, everybody was really cool welcoming and it was really nice to just kind of hear.

344
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:37,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually would encourage anybody who does like podcasts or commenting on the gaming industry to...

345
00:32:38,277 --> 00:32:38,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

346
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:38,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

347
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:01,955
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

348
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:35,220
[SPEAKER_02]: and how devs are sort of navigating that whole ethicalness of, I don't really want to use AI to create assets, but how might I use AI to sort of like inspire assets sort of thing.

349
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very fascinating conversation to sort of listen to.

350
00:33:38,343 --> 00:33:41,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, once in my life, I mostly shut up and listened.

351
00:33:41,546 --> 00:33:43,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very, very interesting.

352
00:33:43,828 --> 00:33:46,370
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would recommend anybody who is into game dev,

353
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:54,155
[SPEAKER_02]: or into games and commenting on them, like check out your local game dev scene and hear things from another perspective.

354
00:33:54,795 --> 00:34:02,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hear things just from X or Blue Sky or Facebook or whatever social media you tend to use.

355
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:05,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just get your gaming perspectives from that.

356
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Like get it from a variety of places.

357
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:09,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting and can be eye-opening.

358
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:10,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that.

359
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:37,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it for really the games I want to talk about this week but I do have one other thing I want to share and I had to mention it at some point tonight but Alan and I adopted a new kitty so there it is on the screen and for those in the podcast feed I'm showing this very light orange kitty and his name is Oreo and you might be wondering why would you name an orange cat

360
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:37,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Oreo.

361
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:47,527
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a very scared boy in that picture because he literally had just been let out in the walk-in closet where he's living right now for a couple days while him and Cheddar get acclimated to each other.

362
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a walk-in closet, so don't worry.

363
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,169
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a lot of space.

364
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,951
[SPEAKER_02]: But you might be wondering, why did I name an orange cat?

365
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was Alan's idea.

366
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:57,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Name an orange cat Oreo.

367
00:34:58,553 --> 00:35:00,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because we have a black and white cat named Cheddar.

368
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:02,799
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

369
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: are a little more light.

370
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:30,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I was thinking Halloween Oreos have the orange cream, but golden Oreos are a little closer to what Oreo the cat looks like.

371
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,895
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it works for me.

372
00:35:32,015 --> 00:35:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So more updates to come.

373
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:39,443
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still in the walk-in closet, but Alan's talking about maybe letting him and Cheddar mingle tomorrow.

374
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:40,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see how that goes.

375
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:43,627
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're really excited about that on the cat front.

376
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:49,360
[SPEAKER_02]: He's eight years old, by the way, so he's already a little bit older, which is around where Cheddar's age is at.

377
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,144
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, senior cats are a little harder to find homes for, so we're happy to take senior cats in.

378
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,306
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just, he's a really nice boy.

379
00:35:56,526 --> 00:36:07,395
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very, he really, really, you know, at first when we went to the house that he was kind of temporarily staying at while they were looking for a home, he was very, like, he ran away.

380
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:09,336
[SPEAKER_02]: He fucking hid behind the fridge.

381
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:10,498
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

382
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him know he has a new home and he's very loving now and he doesn't try to hide.

383
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:33,687
[SPEAKER_02]: But I imagine when we open the door and he can explore, he'll find a new place to hide.

384
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has to eat eventually.

385
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:37,530
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

386
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:40,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on with some more...

387
00:36:41,564 --> 00:36:43,186
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:29,152
[SPEAKER_02]: and I am curious to see how that turns out even though I'm not like huge on the games as other people are and that's not a knock on them I'm just not usually a big zombie person but I understand that the game is pretty good and at some point I'll go back through them but apparently you know the show is really good and so season two I know a lot of people are excited for and Catherine O'Hara is in it so like how could it possibly be bad to be quite honest and

389
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: um let's see uh Mike Deft also suggests Spring Break could be a part of you know and it's fine it is what it is look look if we wanted to have a thousand viewers we would just be more outraged clickbait

390
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that.

391
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:47,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do more outrage clickbait.

392
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:50,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to be that guy.

393
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:51,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be that guy.

394
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the small little group we have here.

395
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:57,286
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an intelligent group of viewers and listeners on the podcast feed.

396
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very happy for that.

397
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:03,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, being famous is probably overrated.

398
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,130
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

399
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Loki.

400
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get back to the news.

401
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so Nintendo has confirmed that their Switch 2 is not going to have achievements.

402
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:16,798
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad.

403
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:28,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to remember that the world of Nintendo exists in a bubble that is several years behind the curve when it comes to certain niceties.

404
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:35,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they just got video chat, so obviously we're going to have to wait a little bit for maybe achievements.

405
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the Switch 3 will have achievements.

406
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of silly, though.

407
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think Nintendo doesn't see the value added in achievements.

408
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:49,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo doesn't see how achievements are fun, and that's why they don't want to do it, which I think is a bummer.

409
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:58,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of the discourse on Blue Sky and social media that are like, good, I don't want achievements in the game because I don't want to have to feel like I have to chase these things down.

410
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, nobody's fucking forcing you.

411
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, and they do already have...

412
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:07,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and they have this stuff already in games.

413
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we saw already with Mario Kart World that they have some sort of achievement system within that game.

414
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:18,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not like that games can't just do that.

415
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:26,138
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is weird, though, that they don't have that type of thing in there anyways, because it is kind of on all the other platforms already.

416
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:29,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's such a missed opportunity.

417
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:32,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's such a missed opportunity with the retro catalog too.

418
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to do it like normal achievement.

419
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:42,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, if you want to make achievements fun, think about the concept differently.

420
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:52,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you had... Again, I'm putting this out there, but I just don't see Nintendo going this direction or innovating this much in this department, quite frankly.

421
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:57,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are concerned about chasing points or chasing trophy levels.

422
00:39:58,256 --> 00:39:59,277
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it wasn't that?

423
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:06,241
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it was like you have a virtual binder, a social media thing, a virtual social media profile where you earn stickers?

424
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be.

425
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds amazing.

426
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:08,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be.

427
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:22,938
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:54,482
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura says, well, Nintendo kind of does the profile picture thing from playing certain NSO games already.

429
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

430
00:40:55,363 --> 00:41:01,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to pay the coins for a lot of them, you know, and it's not really tied to like, I don't know, it should, it should.

431
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:05,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be something a little extra and fun.

432
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:06,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all achievements need to be.

433
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there should be lots of stickers available for just doing other things.

434
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:15,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you bought a game.

435
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:16,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a sticker.

436
00:41:16,694 --> 00:41:19,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You turned on your Switch every day for a week.

437
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:20,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a sticker.

438
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:23,017
[SPEAKER_02]: You added a friend to your friends list.

439
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:23,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a sticker.

440
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be a lot of these things that don't necessarily have to be tied to game achievements so that people can feel like...

441
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:34,322
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still participating even when they don't want to participate.

442
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:34,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the idea.

443
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:37,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You open the settings menu 500 times.

444
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe not that.

445
00:41:39,783 --> 00:41:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not that.

446
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:48,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But just things that are very common and just, I don't know, encourage the other features of the system.

447
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:55,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually in every Xbox or PlayStation game, there is a gimme trophy.

448
00:41:56,633 --> 00:42:01,438
[SPEAKER_02]: for beating the tutorial, for beating stage one, for getting a power up.

449
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:05,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, have a gimme trophy in the game that still gets you something cute.

450
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:07,564
[SPEAKER_05]: The perfect way to sum it up.

451
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:15,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Treat trophies and achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2 like you treat getting stickers in LittleBigPlanet.

452
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

453
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what PlayStation was supposed to do at PlayStation Home.

454
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:24,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the concept of actual trophies on your shelf?

455
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:25,665
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation Home.

456
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:26,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, man.

457
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:30,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo would never.

458
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:31,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo would never.

459
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:35,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually... Thank you for reminding me of this point.

460
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:42,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of this when I was putting the story in the show role, especially when I was thinking about the people that are so anti-achievement and good.

461
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it.

462
00:42:43,332 --> 00:42:45,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need that competitive nature on my system.

463
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:46,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want people knowing what I'm playing.

464
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:47,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like...

465
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:52,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster says, let's go back to the days of when we mailed in for an Activision patch.

466
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:54,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sew on your jacket.

467
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

468
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,820
[SPEAKER_02]: The most old school achievement there is.

469
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that because it's a totally optional thing.

470
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:07,506
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to have that cool ass fucking leather jacket with the sew-ons for all the game stuff you beat, I think that's such a great idea.

471
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh my God.

472
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:10,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine?

473
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:14,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But they would never gatekeep Nintendo clothing based on game performance.

474
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They just wouldn't.

475
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:16,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

476
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I love the idea of like Nintendo, just a virtual Nintendo pad.

477
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:24,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but Nintendo doesn't see the fun in it.

478
00:43:24,884 --> 00:43:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to do it.

479
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:30,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I just, you know, between us and chat, we just described like five different ways they can make it fun.

480
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:31,967
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not interested in that.

481
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:38,390
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say, we're focused on making the games until we can make money off the achievement system.

482
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't find sell stickers, I guess.

483
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

484
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Sell stickers for profiles if that makes you feel better.

485
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,661
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

486
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Stranding 2 On The Beach, Hideo Kojima

487
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:27,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

488
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it was shared in that same interview, Death Stranding 2 is 95% complete.

489
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like it is 10pm, speaking of 24 hours.

490
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Death Stranding 2 is at 10 o'clock and there are two hours left.

491
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:58,463
[SPEAKER_02]: The date of the release is June 26th.

492
00:44:58,703 --> 00:44:59,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, my birthday.

493
00:44:59,684 --> 00:45:01,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a Death Stranding 2 on my birthday.

494
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:05,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's supposed to be 95% complete and will come out then.

495
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting take on the boss fights.

496
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

497
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't... Like, if somebody else skips a boss fight, that doesn't affect my enjoyability of the game.

498
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really care.

499
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:21,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

500
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:26,020
[SPEAKER_05]: People are dumb about the whole, like, oh, it's not hard enough, and why do you get a pass...

501
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:30,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't it be more accessible to people?

502
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:31,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great idea.

503
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:40,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this could be a thing where achievements, fine, you don't get the achievement for killing the boss if you didn't actually kill the boss.

504
00:45:41,122 --> 00:45:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're not interested in showing off that kind of gamer credit, that shouldn't fucking matter.

505
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't matter.

506
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:50,584
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people want to have it both ways.

507
00:45:51,204 --> 00:45:53,585
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to say, well, I want to skip the boss.

508
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:58,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I didn't do, I want to make sure nobody can see that I skipped the boss.

509
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:05,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the reasoning you will hear is, if the option is there, I might use it.

510
00:46:06,051 --> 00:46:08,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want that option to be available to me.

511
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:09,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a you problem.

512
00:46:09,953 --> 00:46:12,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to take some motherfucking accountability, gamers.

513
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:14,864
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

514
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:35,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like that.

515
00:46:36,111 --> 00:46:42,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't control myself, so all of you need to make laws so that we can't do it.

516
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about a certain political party's agenda.

517
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:50,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't control myself, therefore I must pass laws against it.

518
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:57,309
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta ban pornography because I can't... Listen, you know, I'm keeping tabs on my son's pornography.

519
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,570
[SPEAKER_05]: My son is keeping tabs on my pornography.

520
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So therefore, you know, we have a buddy system.

521
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:05,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We trust because we're pure Christians.

522
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:07,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, that's the Speaker of the House, by the way.

523
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:09,073
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not to get confused here.

524
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's ridiculous.

525
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:15,650
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record though, Bobby was absolutely right with that comment.

526
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,752
[SPEAKER_02]: So me saying all that had nothing to do against Bobby.

527
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is absolutely 100% correct with that comment.

528
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be gamers that will complain about that shit.

529
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:26,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And my message to them is get over it.

530
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:27,438
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't fucking care.

531
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:27,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

532
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:30,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, do you run this game company?

533
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,201
[SPEAKER_05]: No, fuck off.

534
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:31,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

535
00:47:31,742 --> 00:47:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your opinion.

536
00:47:34,043 --> 00:47:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Your opinion is valuable to us.

537
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:36,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for sharing.

538
00:47:36,845 --> 00:47:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Pat, pat, pat.

539
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a cookie.

540
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:38,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

541
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:49,680
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll just get pissed off because there'll be a person of color in the game or something like that too or a woman so god forbid you know ow the accuracy no i mean like ow um

542
00:47:51,753 --> 00:47:52,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Ow, the truth hurts.

543
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

544
00:47:56,615 --> 00:48:02,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tigerclaw points out Florida banned porn or rather Pornhub is banned in Florida unless you use a VPN to bypass.

545
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:03,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

546
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:05,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not the only state to do it too.

547
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: When we went to Florida recently for the cruise, all my friends were like, try getting on Pornhub and see what happens.

548
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:12,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I already know what happens.

549
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:15,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to get irritated, you know.

550
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

551
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida may have banned Pornhub, but I bet there's still going to be ways for people to get their porn.

552
00:48:24,036 --> 00:48:24,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

553
00:48:24,717 --> 00:48:29,064
[SPEAKER_05]: They banned porn, but hey, children can work in the factories now, so that's a thing.

554
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:32,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to our next story.

555
00:48:35,408 --> 00:48:39,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people that might... Are we not going to be spicy in this political environment?

556
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize DarkSakura was the one that was grounding the political spiciness on this show.

557
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,696
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?

558
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually she's the first one to pop off.

559
00:48:48,198 --> 00:48:50,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight we're just unrestrained.

560
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't possibly just exist in this world being constantly... You try to avoid it all online.

561
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:58,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm just going to avoid it.

562
00:48:58,205 --> 00:48:59,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go...

563
00:49:00,509 --> 00:49:01,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go on with my day.

564
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, you hear about something else, like... Like... Yeah.

565
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:09,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

566
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:12,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, DarkSakura says, yeah, Rob is so done with his bullshit.

567
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's been done.

568
00:49:13,336 --> 00:49:13,936
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been done.

569
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:14,636
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway.

570
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, talking about games that might be made in a factory later.

571
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:23,081
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Spanish developer that went by the name TequilaWorks.

572
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:25,102
[SPEAKER_02]: They made Rime and...

573
00:49:25,822 --> 00:49:27,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilt, G-Y-L-T.

574
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:31,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They also published the sexy Brutal, but they created Rhyme and Guilt.

575
00:49:32,866 --> 00:49:41,372
[SPEAKER_02]: The studio unfortunately went under in 2024 because prolonged market conditions made it financially difficult to stay afloat, and so they went under.

576
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:54,940
[SPEAKER_02]: The games that they made, as well as the IP, intellectual property rights, are now available to bid on the auction site Escrapalia, which I believe would be a Spanish bidding site.

577
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,222
[SPEAKER_02]: because Tequila Works was a Spanish developer.

578
00:49:59,123 --> 00:50:02,745
[SPEAKER_02]: This would include Deadlight, Rime, and Guilt.

579
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in-development projects are being auctioned off.

580
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ancient Mariner, Dungeon Tour, and Brawler Crawler.

581
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,871
[SPEAKER_02]: These are unfinished games.

582
00:50:12,852 --> 00:50:23,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So the studio did release Song of Nunu, a League of Legends story, but then they closed, basically, after Tencent got a controlling stake in Tequila Works.

583
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:26,881
[SPEAKER_02]: They are gone.

584
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of curious, like, how much is this going for right now, actually?

585
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:34,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see... Here we go.

586
00:50:34,685 --> 00:50:40,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so if you wanted the trademark to rhyme, that is currently going for 15,500 euros.

587
00:50:45,086 --> 00:50:47,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Deadlight is at 11,000 euros Deadlight is at 11,000 euros

588
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:08,668
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not bad for a game that probably paid a lot more people their time to create.

589
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:11,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with this Dungeon Tour and Brawler Crawler.

590
00:51:12,629 --> 00:51:18,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looked like somebody has bid one euro above the minimum.

591
00:51:18,752 --> 00:51:20,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost feel like somebody's bid the minimum.

592
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I guess it says 140 bids, 65 bids.

593
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:22,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

594
00:51:26,776 --> 00:51:28,197
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reserve price.

595
00:51:29,218 --> 00:51:30,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess no reserve price.

596
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:33,320
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how high it's gotten without a reserve.

597
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, 30 days left?

598
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:38,423
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot of time left, so we'll see what these holes really go for.

599
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:47,629
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's where things stand today for a publisher to potentially just say, we're going to make our own sequel to Guilt and put the name on it.

600
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:49,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

601
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:51,672
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's move on.

602
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:51,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

603
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,066
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

604
00:51:54,827 --> 00:52:10,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a former CEO of PlayStation was on... Was it... Speaking to PlayerDrive in a video chat, Sean Layden, mentioning that, you know, if you account for inflation, game prices have gone down.

605
00:52:10,514 --> 00:52:11,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again...

606
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,521
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll explain why that's wrong.

607
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make any sense.

608
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:23,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, he also says that, you know, game companies should just add $5 to the price of games per generation.

609
00:52:23,487 --> 00:52:30,051
[SPEAKER_05]: That way that, you know, gamers are more eased into the higher prices as stuff goes on.

610
00:52:30,371 --> 00:52:32,173
[SPEAKER_05]: He says in 2025, you know, $59.99 in 1999 is like the equivalent to $100.

611
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:43,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you know, your purchasing power compared to that against your cost of living is smaller than it was.

612
00:52:45,534 --> 00:52:51,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, companies have been reluctant to push that price up because they probably should have done it.

613
00:52:52,877 --> 00:53:00,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in, at the time, probably every generation should have baked in a $5 software price hike and make that typical.

614
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, every generation is another $5 and you would have gone up to $90 by now.

615
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:07,883
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, fuck you.

616
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:11,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And second off, once again, the false...

617
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:24,191
[SPEAKER_05]: The false comparison against saying games are cheaper than they are now completely ignores the fact that we don't purchase games like we did back in the 90s.

618
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So he wants to equate it to 1999.

619
00:53:27,172 --> 00:53:38,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So 1999, you would buy a PlayStation 2 game that was, well, first off, it wasn't $59.99, it was $49.99, and the game was complete.

620
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:40,156
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your game.

621
00:53:40,876 --> 00:53:41,516
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

622
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:17,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, like I said, that completely ignores the fact that not only are games more expensive now, but then you're piecemealing all this shit that would have been free with your full game back in the day.

623
00:54:17,506 --> 00:54:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example, one of the very first games to actually kind of have...

624
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:31,075
[SPEAKER_05]: A multi-platform release that was on a system that was on the Xbox 360.

625
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:35,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lot more piecemeal with DLC and stuff like that.

626
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,821
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox.

627
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:40,343
[SPEAKER_05]: That game being, I believe it was Scarface.

628
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it Scarface or Mafia?

629
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:47,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Scarface had basically, like it did back in the day...

630
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:55,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheat codes they could put in with controller presses on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox that didn't really have a big marketplace where you could buy all this DLC.

631
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:56,963
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360...

632
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:00,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Those button presses weren't in there.

633
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:05,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to purchase your cheats separately because they were selling it back to you.

634
00:55:05,267 --> 00:55:09,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were physically cutting content out of the game and then selling it back to you.

635
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:26,278
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of all of the monetization with microtransactions, all of this season pass nonsense where you're pre-ordering DLC that may or may not come out, games being released in a buggy, unfinished state in the first place because now we have the ability to patch those in later on.

636
00:55:26,778 --> 00:55:42,186
[SPEAKER_05]: and so games are coming out fundamentally broken and with a roadmap of how they're going to fix it over the course of 6 to 12 months if they even do all that because if it's not making money then they're not going to invest money into it so I'm sorry you cannot say that it's exactly the same and that we should be paying more

637
00:55:42,746 --> 00:55:43,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

638
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:07,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not.

639
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So once again, to summarize, fuck you, Sean Layden, and this is bullshit.

640
00:56:14,186 --> 00:56:17,649
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, meanwhile, the cost of living hasn't gone up.

641
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck out of here.

642
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:20,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree with that.

643
00:56:20,092 --> 00:56:23,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I want to share something with you all that I was just kind of Googling.

644
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:26,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what is Sean Layden's net worth?

645
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:27,300
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

646
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to share something I found with you.

647
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:35,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm going to state clearly, this is for the purposes of entertainment only and is not to be accepted as fact.

648
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:40,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, the site that came up has AI in the title, so I already distrust it.

649
00:56:40,406 --> 00:56:47,109
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're going to... I still want to drive the car to something that I think many of us would go, you know, I do hear about this.

650
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:51,711
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in line with what I hear in the news about CEOs and things of that sort.

651
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

652
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:52,412
[SPEAKER_02]: But again...

653
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm presenting this as probably made-up shit, but in line with the real shit, okay?

654
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: For the purposes of entertainment.

655
00:57:00,999 --> 00:57:05,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So this website claims that in 2021, Sean Landon's net worth was $966,000.

656
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:12,208
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2025, that net worth is $1.61 million.

657
00:57:12,488 --> 00:57:16,071
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I already distrust it because I know he made more than that when he was working at the company.

658
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:18,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is probably some type of social media algorithm.

659
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:21,036
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the point still stands.

660
00:57:21,656 --> 00:57:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: How much did you make in 2021?

661
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much do you make today?

662
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:27,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it go up by 170%?

663
00:57:27,863 --> 00:57:40,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is Shawn Layton potentially, possibly, theoretically living in a bubble that the rest of us, that isn't the reality for the rest of us?

664
00:57:44,335 --> 00:58:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah think about that next time you read an article about what is true what is fact is that CEOs get multi-million dollar bonuses and you hear about it in the news all of the time so anyway yeah this is the dam that has to break who is making money off video games and why

665
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

666
00:58:32,538 --> 00:58:55,302
[SPEAKER_02]: are fat and piggish um so these people that are sitting at the top of the uh industry are making all this money just to make bad decisions like oh we should replace people with AI when AI doesn't get shit right that same fucking article I quoted earlier in the show about how did the spread of misinformation on the cost of a video game happen

667
00:58:56,996 --> 00:59:01,318
[SPEAKER_02]: AI was still reporting at the time of that article that Mario Kart World would cost $90.

668
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:02,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in the AI.

669
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you say something on the internet so much, AI accepts it to be fact.

670
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:20,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what fat pigs, metaphor, in Washington, in gaming companies, believe can replace people.

671
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:23,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Broken fucking algorithms.

672
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:31,183
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's going to come a point where people go, what are the fat pigs doing for us?

673
00:59:33,965 --> 00:59:35,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow we're having bacon.

674
00:59:38,887 --> 00:59:40,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to our next story.

675
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it mine or yours?

676
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know now.

677
00:59:46,831 --> 00:59:47,351
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yours.

678
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:50,073
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be soft.

679
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the fattest fucking pig in the room.

680
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:56,696
[SPEAKER_02]: In the bank account, of course.

681
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:00,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about this whole thing with the crew.

682
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crew, you know, people actually went to a class action lawsuit over the crew because the servers shut down.

683
01:00:09,365 --> 01:00:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So players in California last year filed a lawsuit saying that once you shut down the title, they, thousands of other people that played this game, got a skeleton of what you thought you paid for.

684
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:27,277
[SPEAKER_02]: The argument was the crew should have been left in a playable offline state rather than being delisted and taken offline.

685
01:00:27,618 --> 01:00:34,981
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ubisoft said they had to do it because of server infrastructure and licensing constraints, but they maintained support for over a decade.

686
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:43,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, in the lawsuit for the folks in California that filed the lawsuit, they felt totally barred access to the product they paid money for.

687
01:00:43,746 --> 01:00:56,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine you buy a pinball machine and years later you enter your den to go play it only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed.

688
01:00:57,329 --> 01:00:59,589
[SPEAKER_02]: That is in the lawsuit, that verbiage.

689
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out the pinball machine manufacturer decided to come into your house, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned.

690
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:18,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Ubisoft filed a response in February saying the argument that the crew is going to be playable indefinitely is misleading.

691
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:23,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It was explicitly selling temporary access to a product and not outright ownership.

692
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:34,986
[SPEAKER_02]: In the response, they said plaintiffs do not allege that Ubisoft made any statements indicating that consumers would in fact obtain unfettered access to the crew if they purchased a physical copy.

693
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:39,808
[SPEAKER_02]: To the contrary, the packaging made clear that Ubisoft could limit access.

694
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:43,911
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fatal to plaintiffs FAL, UCL, and CLRA claims.

695
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Plaintiffs' entire theory of the case is based on the faulty assumption that buying a physical disc entitles purchasers to infinite access to play the game.

696
01:01:55,553 --> 01:02:01,257
[SPEAKER_02]: They go on to say this flawed assumption doesn't necessarily make it misrepresentation under California law.

697
01:02:01,697 --> 01:02:19,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were selling a license to a product as opposed to ownership rights, which by the way, you know, the license that these rules have changed in California that when you're in these stores buying these products on digital stores, it now has to tell you it's a digital license and can't use words like owned forever and things like that.

698
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't use those types of words.

699
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:30,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently the plaintiffs have responded and there was a picture of the crew's packaging which notes the activation code won't expire until 2099.

700
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:34,864
[SPEAKER_02]: That is damning evidence in my opinion.

701
01:02:35,344 --> 01:02:35,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Damning.

702
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:43,150
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it's an example of Ubisoft indicating the crew would remain playable during this time and long thereafter.

703
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:45,992
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, that is a smoking gun.

704
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:47,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

705
01:02:48,913 --> 01:02:51,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fucking lawyer, for better or for worse.

706
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:55,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what ultimately will come of this in court.

707
01:02:55,819 --> 01:03:01,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But Ubisoft, including something that says this will work until 2099, not a great look.

708
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:06,908
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it, like, if ownership isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing?

709
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that was the line.

710
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:22,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Which again, I don't endorse piracy, but I think we all need to open our fucking eyes that as the industry gets more and more greedy when it comes to the price of games, people are going to turn to piracy.

711
01:03:28,128 --> 01:03:34,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think you're going to see more indie and small studios where the fat pigs aren't so fat.

712
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,270
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little leaner.

713
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:49,493
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see that their games that are priced at $20 and $30 because they don't have to pay multi-million dollar CEO salaries and they're not publicly traded companies that are obligated to make money for their investors.

714
01:03:49,914 --> 01:03:52,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to see more successes on that front.

715
01:03:53,054 --> 01:03:55,615
[SPEAKER_02]: More Five Nights at Freddy's, more Minecrafts, more

716
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:59,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Bellatros, more, you're gonna see more of that.

717
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:03,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Shredder's Revenge, $20 game, playing behind Loki right now.

718
01:04:03,278 --> 01:04:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

719
01:04:03,498 --> 01:04:03,478
$20?

720
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:05,179
[SPEAKER_02]: $30?

721
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:05,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Still.

722
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:06,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

723
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than $80.

724
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:09,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

725
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:11,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see.

726
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Black of his chat says, EULA's end user license agreement haven't been really tested in court yet, so it may or may not be a binding contract.

727
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:19,905
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

728
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:22,066
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things tend to settle out of court.

729
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:49,786
[SPEAKER_05]: well also when you think about it like with with those EULAs or whatever especially when we're talking about the crew which is an E10 game or probably at most teen um your user could be underage which case it would not be able to you know abide by your contract and they could still have purchased the game legally too so once again you have no contract at that point yeah

730
01:04:52,455 --> 01:05:14,913
[SPEAKER_02]: well we'll see we'll see what develops with this but I don't know I don't know like look look I I think this is also a symptom of publishers trying to catch that coin of the always online um games as a service because that's what the crew was at the end of the day games as a service this is a symptom of of companies trying to forever chase that is that

731
01:05:18,022 --> 01:05:21,566
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't consider this end of what's going to happen when we pull the plug on the game.

732
01:05:21,826 --> 01:05:25,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be some pissed off people that still want to be able to play this game that they bought.

733
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to rely on this whole, well, we never told you that you'd own this game forever.

734
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: But we took all your money, like it would be.

735
01:05:32,097 --> 01:05:34,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, at some point, that dam's going to break.

736
01:05:36,485 --> 01:05:37,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Questbusters.

737
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:39,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Love this quote from Questbuster in chat.

738
01:05:39,386 --> 01:05:44,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitch.tv slash VOG Network live on Sunday night saying, we can't make SimCity offline.

739
01:05:44,949 --> 01:05:47,930
[SPEAKER_01]: What EA said about the last SimCity before making it offline.

740
01:05:51,972 --> 01:05:56,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, look, I've been giving a lot of people in the industry hell.

741
01:05:57,975 --> 01:05:58,975
[SPEAKER_02]: on the top of the industry.

742
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:04,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Never the hardworking devs and frontline people actually making the games, but the people at the top in the boardrooms.

743
01:06:04,957 --> 01:06:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been giving them a lot of shit tonight.

744
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:09,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something nice to say now.

745
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:11,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say something nice about one of them.

746
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:12,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So note the date and time.

747
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:19,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Karsh, CEO and Co-Founder of Saber Interactive

748
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:33,341
[SPEAKER_02]: to help, quote, shape the next generation of creative leaders in the video game industry.

749
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:51,931
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, Sony Interactive Entertainment donated $3 million to the University of Southern California's Gerald A. Lawson Fund in 2022.

750
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:53,852
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is a company.

751
01:06:54,252 --> 01:07:02,397
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one person that is a CEO at a company that, you know, what did these guys make?

752
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Timeshift?

753
01:07:03,297 --> 01:07:04,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their game, right?

754
01:07:04,818 --> 01:07:09,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's nice to see people using that money.

755
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:13,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2.

756
01:07:13,892 --> 01:07:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their big latest title that they did.

757
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:27,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to see somebody give a little bit of that money back because some people don't need all of those millions and billions of dollars in order to lead a happy life.

758
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:29,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use that money for good.

759
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:39,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So kudos to the CEO there at Saber Interactive for doing something good there to help shape future people in the industry.

760
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:40,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

761
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwolf points out they're a former Embracer subsidiary.

762
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:45,230
[SPEAKER_02]: 3D Realms is part of them.

763
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:45,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

764
01:07:46,411 --> 01:07:47,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty interesting.

765
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:56,720
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, let's talk about the Minecraft movie and some interesting, which by the way is still making tons of fucking money, right?

766
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Half a billion dollars now?

767
01:07:57,601 --> 01:07:58,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, almost like half a million.

768
01:07:58,622 --> 01:07:59,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Half a billion.

769
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, half a billion.

770
01:07:59,923 --> 01:08:00,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

771
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:03,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, what's going on with the Minecraft movie showings, Loki?

772
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:03,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

773
01:08:04,824 --> 01:08:07,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just basically the same nonsense that's been going on.

774
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:12,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously one of the things that's been popular with the Minecraft movie is shouting out all the lines that were in the trailers.

775
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: um you know like the chicken jockey thing um you flint and steel all that type of stuff but the problem is it's become I think this is more of like a you know social media like kind of meme thing where they start um not only just shouting out the lines in the theaters but throwing popcorn at the same time and making an absolute mess of the theaters of course uh

776
01:08:37,543 --> 01:09:04,977
[SPEAKER_05]: the director of the movie Jared Hess is completely cool with that thinking like hey no harm you know it's just been crazy people are sending me some really hilarious speeches that they're doing standing up in the middle you know before the movie starts and you know it's it's hilarious you know I think it's funny that people are cheering and throwing popcorn which is funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn cops are getting called because they're causing a lot of ruckus it's not just popcorn it's like all sorts of like

777
01:09:05,737 --> 01:09:21,022
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff happening where they're asking them to basically behave in a theater and they're not and it's not fair for the employees that have to clean up that mess either because everyone wants to participate in a meme or like you know clout for social media or something like that.

778
01:09:22,444 --> 01:09:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so basically a take on it is Jared Hess is obviously for it because he's making tons of money from people going to the theater that have this type of experience, you know, repeat viewers and whatnot of the Minecraft movie.

779
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:45,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, he's not going to say, hey, tone it down a bit, you know, so they're trying to make it into like an event where people just go and shout out the lines at the screen and stuff.

780
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:52,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that some theaters are advertising a 4D experience for people that want to be rowdy.

781
01:09:52,536 --> 01:09:55,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't love the Rocky Horror comparisons.

782
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:56,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't.

783
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:59,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm somebody that's been involved with Rocky for like 20 years.

784
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:09,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is that Rocky Horror also kind of exists as like this safe space, especially in the 70s, especially when this whole thing started in New York City with the cult screenings.

785
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:12,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It really existed as a safe place for

786
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: for, uh, people that really didn't fit in anywhere else to be able to congregate weekly and, you know, get out their frustrations, you know, watch this really bad movie together as a family and all of this stuff.

787
01:10:24,378 --> 01:10:27,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really see those parallels when it comes to Minecraft.

788
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the important thing about Rocky Horror is that you know what you're getting into when you go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

789
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: It is always advertised as a, you know, it's

790
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

791
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:03,648
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all been to a movie where somebody yells back at the screen or somebody in the audience.

792
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when we went to see The Grudge and I yelled at somebody in the back of the theater saying, would the guy with the little dick in the back of the room please shut the fuck up?

793
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:17,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he kept – I shouted this at the top of my lung because this guy in the back during all the scary scenes in this movie was going –

794
01:11:18,462 --> 01:11:20,382
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

795
01:11:44,358 --> 01:12:05,821
[SPEAKER_02]: so um well yeah whatever it's it's it's and it's i would never do that to kids and it's you know but i also would know to avoid the showings of the minecraft movie where there are a lot of kids like well it's not necessarily kids i think it's like older kids and like college teenagers the worst you know basically

796
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:10,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, kids going there by themselves, not with, obviously, a family.

797
01:12:10,966 --> 01:12:12,528
[SPEAKER_05]: The family's not, you know, encouraging them.

798
01:12:12,768 --> 01:12:16,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure shouting, like, the line or saying the line or something like that, that's fine.

799
01:12:17,192 --> 01:12:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's people that, like, take it too far and are super obnoxious with it.

800
01:12:21,157 --> 01:12:24,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Throwing the food is just stupid anyways because...

801
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:31,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's advertised that way as a fuck-it-all type of experience, then fine.

802
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:35,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And one good yell is fine.

803
01:12:35,323 --> 01:12:40,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying everything has to be, oh, it's a prim and proper night at the theater, and everybody shut the fuck up.

804
01:12:40,826 --> 01:12:43,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But look, there were a lot of people that didn't want to see Wicked.

805
01:12:43,968 --> 01:12:45,749
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

806
01:13:05,458 --> 01:13:05,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

807
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.

808
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:12,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, for the most part, at least the two that I saw, it wasn't too bad.

809
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:18,594
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a few obnoxious people shouting a lot at some of the stuff, overreacting to it.

810
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:22,058
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was minor, and it wasn't involving throwing food or anything.

811
01:13:22,078 --> 01:13:22,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can tell you...

812
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:29,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really want to risk that in this type of an environment with the people that are just pissed off at everything?

813
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:35,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to throw sodas, going to land on somebody, and they're going to come destroy that child, you know?

814
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:36,363
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

815
01:13:37,423 --> 01:13:43,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the police are getting called, because you're essentially... Throwing a soda at somebody is a little much.

816
01:13:43,565 --> 01:13:43,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

817
01:13:44,906 --> 01:13:45,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

818
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:48,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there other things that I heard or read?

819
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:54,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it people throwing up or, like, pretending to throw up?

820
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Bringing live chickens into the theater?

821
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what Def just said.

822
01:13:57,691 --> 01:13:59,672
[SPEAKER_02]: An actual living chicken into the theater?

823
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:00,052
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

824
01:14:01,192 --> 01:14:16,112
[SPEAKER_02]: y'all we don't even let you have real it's everybody trying to one up somebody for social media clout and for the record at Rocky Horror Picture Show we don't even let you bring real lighters anymore in fact you can't throw rice you can't throw fucking rice anymore because it's too much of a pain in the ass to clean up and

825
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:19,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with the same logic with weddings too.

826
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just not that there's birds inside the theater, but a lot of it gets swept up and swept outside where the birds might pick it up.

827
01:14:25,157 --> 01:14:31,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So use bubbles, use iPhone lights or like apps that look like lighters for there's a light.

828
01:14:32,282 --> 01:14:34,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually glow sticks is the big thing now because glow sticks are so cheap.

829
01:14:35,023 --> 01:14:39,086
[SPEAKER_02]: You just sell like a quarter for a glow stick and people use that during there's a light.

830
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:41,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, oh my God, actual animals?

831
01:14:42,308 --> 01:14:44,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please, please.

832
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:43,679
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't it's just because I don't know anyway but no fucking real animals get a grip Jesus all right um yeah let's move I'll still see Minecraft in a couple more weeks in a couple more weeks when this dies down a little more when some other new kiddie movie comes out that everybody else is distracted with we'll go see we'll go see I will leave it on Stitch well that's all July there's a lot of stuff coming out in July

833
01:15:44,385 --> 01:15:46,947
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, didn't that movie about Sacramento come out this week?

834
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:48,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The Michael Cera?

835
01:15:48,308 --> 01:15:49,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the poster.

836
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:53,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because apparently we get Michael Cera as our poster child.

837
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

838
01:15:54,512 --> 01:15:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, they made a whole fucking movie about Sacramento.

839
01:15:56,453 --> 01:15:57,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like a road trip or something.

840
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:03,358
[SPEAKER_02]: But that really, oh God, she's so funny on that movie, that Pen15.

841
01:16:03,818 --> 01:16:04,659
[SPEAKER_02]: She was on that show.

842
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:05,719
[SPEAKER_02]: She's in this movie.

843
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

844
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Maya, is that her name?

845
01:16:08,882 --> 01:16:10,883
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so funny in that show.

846
01:16:10,963 --> 01:16:11,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's in this movie.

847
01:16:11,804 --> 01:16:13,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would see it because she's in it.

848
01:16:14,147 --> 01:16:15,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

849
01:16:15,808 --> 01:16:16,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

850
01:16:16,828 --> 01:16:17,148
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

851
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Minecraft, I think this is very interesting.

852
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:40,137
[SPEAKER_02]: The Minecraft soundtrack is going to be officially preserved for all eternity or until the end of our society as a nation, which could be a little sooner, with the preservation of the Minecraft soundtrack in the USA's Library of Congress.

853
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

854
01:16:41,377 --> 01:16:48,142
[SPEAKER_02]: The original music for Minecraft is being inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.

855
01:16:48,182 --> 01:16:58,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's now part of the American Archives, which is interesting because it was composed by a German producer, Daniel Rosenfeld, known as C418.

856
01:16:58,628 --> 01:17:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, still, we have lots of foreign influence in our society.

857
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,174
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the great artists and sculptures and paintings were from all over the world.

858
01:17:07,574 --> 01:17:08,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just another...

859
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: The Reboot Sound for Windows 95, which I never knew was a Brian Eno, did he?

860
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is one of those like new wave guys.

861
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:32,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that.

862
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:38,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that was also apparently inducted into the registry, the Library of Congress.

863
01:17:38,425 --> 01:17:51,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of the 25 recordings that made up the additions for this year, which by the way, include other more traditional types of songs, such as the 2015 original Broadway cast of Hamilton.

864
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:52,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

865
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and so on and so on, just to give you some examples of other things that are in there.

866
01:17:58,482 --> 01:18:01,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Minecraft soundtrack is kind of along with that, which is kind of neat.

867
01:18:02,505 --> 01:18:04,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

868
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:11,853
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I think that's a good segment for us to get into the classic game of the week.

869
01:18:12,113 --> 01:18:12,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.

870
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:31,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

871
01:18:32,392 --> 01:18:34,933
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

872
01:18:37,073 --> 01:18:43,756
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura isn't here tonight, so usually when DarkSakura isn't here, one of us will take over this segment for tonight.

873
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually going to let Loki pick the classic game of the week.

874
01:18:49,518 --> 01:18:56,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I just want to remind everybody, the rule that's out there for the classic game of the week is that the game has to be 10 years old.

875
01:18:58,241 --> 01:19:01,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Old or More to be inducted as a Classic Game of the Week.

876
01:19:01,943 --> 01:19:06,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want you to keep that in the back of your head as we talk about tonight's inductee by Loki.

877
01:19:07,005 --> 01:19:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what is being inducted as a Classic Game of the Week tonight?

878
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And believe it or not, it's actually almost 12 years old, but Grand Theft Auto V. Yes, the game that is still popular.

879
01:19:18,711 --> 01:19:19,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Still being played.

880
01:19:19,231 --> 01:19:21,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto V. It came out in September of 2013.

881
01:19:21,332 --> 01:19:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

882
01:19:28,015 --> 01:19:28,595
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

883
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:57,195
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, obviously Grand Theft Auto is known for its, like, you know, free roam and, you know, crime kind of simulator type games.

884
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:08,101
[SPEAKER_05]: This one had a really great story, I think, what was unique about it, obviously, with the three different protagonists, you can kind of jump into each one of them at different times and take on the lead as those.

885
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, there was a big, massive push for online as well, so we had...

886
01:20:15,097 --> 01:20:42,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto Online but yes originally this was released on September 2013 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 later on it would then come out on in November of 2014 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One April 2015 on Windows and then of course a little bit more recent March 2022 on PlayStation 5 and then the Xbox Series

887
01:20:44,092 --> 01:20:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's been re-released a lot of times, and you bet your butt it's probably coming to the Switch 2 as well, so expect that at some point.

888
01:20:54,004 --> 01:20:57,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know when, but it's probably coming.

889
01:20:58,309 --> 01:20:58,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

890
01:20:59,628 --> 01:21:03,112
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously this game has made so much money.

891
01:21:03,412 --> 01:21:04,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.

892
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:07,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Billions upon billions upon billions of dollars.

893
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:16,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of that, like I said, is due to Grand Theft Auto Online, the very persistent games as a service.

894
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:44,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Just persistent online space where you can do heists, all sorts of different mission types All the trappings of something that is trying to take your money Basically having to pay for every little thing Sports cars, rent, people to maintain your car Your car gets exploded, you gotta buy a new car, fix it up Gotta pay for all that, it ain't free

895
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:46,138
[SPEAKER_05]: SpikeVGX in 2013

896
01:22:12,984 --> 01:22:13,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

897
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:36,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only a matter of time before we find out what's in Grand Theft Auto 6.

898
01:22:36,778 --> 01:22:37,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here we go.

899
01:22:38,038 --> 01:22:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the second best video game of all time with 210 million copies sold and making $8.5 billion worldwide in revenue.

900
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not enough, obviously.

901
01:22:54,627 --> 01:22:55,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They gotta make more money.

902
01:22:56,548 --> 01:22:56,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

903
01:22:58,698 --> 01:23:00,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's your classic game of the week.

904
01:23:00,259 --> 01:23:01,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta keep renting that money.

905
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:02,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

906
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:15,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, you knew, Loki, you would have to pick this one someday, but I just think it's so funny that this game is only, or this game is already 13 years old, right?

907
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:23,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and 13, yeah, considering it's 13 years old, like, or not 13 years old, but it's like 12 years old at this point, or almost 12.

908
01:23:24,555 --> 01:23:26,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering that, it was like so incredible

909
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:38,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The details that they put into this game, which is even the movement and the graphics and everything, it's going to be a wonder to see what Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like when that's released.

910
01:23:39,732 --> 01:23:42,193
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is going to be groundbreaking.

911
01:23:42,233 --> 01:23:44,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very excited to see what that looks like.

912
01:23:45,373 --> 01:23:46,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster in chat.

913
01:23:46,453 --> 01:23:48,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Not for $120 at retail, hopefully, but we'll see.

914
01:23:48,874 --> 01:23:49,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope.

915
01:23:49,814 --> 01:23:54,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster in chat points out, well, it'll be $80 now that Nintendo's gotten us there.

916
01:23:54,915 --> 01:23:59,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just a question of what add-ons are they going to sell you to make it $120?

917
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:03,357
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they going to put into the online to make it $120?

918
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:10,625
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, it looks like we're just having some quick lag issues on Discord, so Loki's face is frozen right now, but I don't know.

919
01:24:10,885 --> 01:24:11,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun.

920
01:24:11,165 --> 01:24:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just a Discord thing.

921
01:24:12,968 --> 01:24:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be able to set... I'm going to do a quick one, too, just to... I don't think it's a Discord thing.

922
01:24:16,973 --> 01:24:18,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's my camera app, actually.

923
01:24:18,955 --> 01:24:19,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

924
01:24:19,376 --> 01:24:19,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, phew.

925
01:24:19,776 --> 01:24:21,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

926
01:24:21,318 --> 01:24:23,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just reset that.

927
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:24,221
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, yeah.

928
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:31,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of that while I mention from the chat, QuestBuster talks about the roleplay community is pretty incredible around GTA Online.

929
01:24:31,884 --> 01:24:37,545
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched streams where people actually act as cops and robbers, perform due process and everything.

930
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:41,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's... I've seen some of those roleplay streams... Oh, there you go, you're better.

931
01:24:42,247 --> 01:24:50,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of those roleplay streams too, which are really... It's a lot, but it's... I mean, that's cool that people go all the way with it like that.

932
01:24:50,449 --> 01:24:52,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you're gonna commit to the bit, commit to the bit.

933
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some other headlines in Rapid Fire News.

934
01:24:58,104 --> 01:24:58,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

935
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, they keep teasing me like this.

936
01:25:02,671 --> 01:25:09,621
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to suspend disbelief again, but apparently there's a leaker out there, an Apex Legends leaker.

937
01:25:10,287 --> 01:25:23,696
[SPEAKER_05]: who maybe have some sort of credibility, says that Titanfall 3 is actually happening and that it's going to feature the Apex Legends cast and it's going to multiplayer and campaign and all that fun stuff.

938
01:25:25,137 --> 01:25:31,341
[SPEAKER_05]: This, I guess, was leaked April 9th and said, yeah, it's almost complete.

939
01:25:33,062 --> 01:25:34,643
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see.

940
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:36,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but...

941
01:25:37,952 --> 01:25:44,619
[SPEAKER_02]: What a lovely thing to announce at Summer Game Fest for release this holiday, but what do I know?

942
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:48,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so we'll have to wait and see if that actually happens.

943
01:25:49,663 --> 01:25:56,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, Xbox, their big summer showcase, is going to have an entire...

944
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:58,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Outer Worlds

945
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be into that.

946
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,247
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be into an Oblivion remake.

947
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:34,627
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

948
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:35,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

949
01:26:35,728 --> 01:26:38,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that means more Oblivion mods.

950
01:26:38,749 --> 01:26:39,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

951
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:44,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody that will inevitably create Oblivion and Skyrim in the same game.

952
01:26:44,352 --> 01:26:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that probably already exists somewhere.

953
01:26:46,153 --> 01:26:46,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that already exists.

954
01:26:46,933 --> 01:26:47,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course it does.

955
01:26:47,774 --> 01:26:48,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it does.

956
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:49,875
[SPEAKER_02]: How dare I think otherwise?

957
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:54,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on and talk about Street Fighter VI, which we were talking about earlier in the show.

958
01:26:54,757 --> 01:26:58,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that on June 5th, a new character is going to be coming out.

959
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:07,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Elena will be the addition to the roster, which she was in Street Fighter III Strike, if I remember correctly, because I believe she was the character I preferred to play because she kind of dances.

960
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,143
[SPEAKER_02]: She fights from dancing.

961
01:27:11,223 --> 01:27:21,447
[SPEAKER_02]: and this of course is being timed quite well with the launch of the Switch 2 version and the Year 1 through 2 Fighters Edition which is what basically the Switch 2 version is.

962
01:27:22,007 --> 01:27:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Elena will be added on June 5th.

963
01:27:24,648 --> 01:27:32,532
[SPEAKER_02]: You can purchase with Fighter Coins and if you have the Year 2 Character Pass or Ultimate Pass, you automatically will get access to Elena.

964
01:27:33,872 --> 01:27:38,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Note that depending on your time zone, Elena may actually release on June 4th

965
01:27:38,894 --> 01:27:41,415
[SPEAKER_02]: following server maintenance, depending on where you are.

966
01:27:41,855 --> 01:27:44,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So fun new character for the game there.

967
01:27:45,097 --> 01:27:47,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some new updates to Switch Online.

968
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:51,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some new Genesis games or Mega Drive games, depending on where you live.

969
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would mean it's for the Nintendo Switch Online expansion pack.

970
01:27:57,049 --> 01:28:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which, uh, will add these three Genesis games to the collection.

975

[SPEAKER_05]: $100 for two games Fuck off I was going to make a joke Nintendo is going to charge $180 for this because it's two games The truth is stranger than fiction

1020
01:34:26,055 --> 01:34:30,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, when did The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered come out?

[SPEAKER_05]: Was that like earlier this year?

1022
01:34:32,818 --> 01:34:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1023
01:34:33,979 --> 01:34:36,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a couple years ago at this point.

1024
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:38,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

1025
01:34:40,101 --> 01:34:40,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1026
01:34:40,942 --> 01:34:41,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

1027
01:34:41,502 --> 01:34:42,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 2020.

1028
01:34:43,463 --> 01:34:46,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're charging $50 for a four-year-old, five-year-old game?

1029
01:34:46,164 --> 01:34:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Remastered.

01:34:54,935 --> 01:34:55,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when's the remastered?

1034
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:00,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me.

1035
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:03,421
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that long.

1036
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one or two years ago.

1037
01:35:05,923 --> 01:35:06,503
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, OK.

1038
01:35:06,543 --> 01:35:06,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1039
01:35:06,803 --> 01:35:07,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year.

1040
01:35:07,283 --> 01:35:08,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So January 19th.

1041
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:09,365
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1042
01:35:10,005 --> 01:35:10,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, OK.

1043
01:35:10,566 --> 01:35:11,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the very beginning of last year.

1044
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:13,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1045
01:35:13,027 --> 01:35:13,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year.

1046
01:35:13,548 --> 01:35:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

1047
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Still.

1048
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:26,849
[SPEAKER_02]: should be lower than $49.99 I guess we see where Nintendo got their inspiration well that game is always on sale if you're paying full price for those games either of them

1049
01:35:28,217 --> 01:35:31,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, because they always go on sale during PlayStation sales.

1050
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:38,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm almost positive those games show up on the PlayStation Plus service that, you know, if you want to pay the extra money for that.

1051
01:35:38,865 --> 01:35:43,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you know, Nintendo, Sony will get that $100 out of you one way or another.

1052
01:35:44,248 --> 01:35:45,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that as well.

1053
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:51,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So, oh, I guess I'm trying to figure.

1054
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so The Last of Us.

1055
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,863
[SPEAKER_05]: was Last of Us Part 1.

1056
01:35:59,865 --> 01:36:04,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's not Last of Us Remastered because that gets confusing as well on top of all that.

1057
01:36:04,970 --> 01:36:06,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Last of Us Part 1.

1058
01:36:09,354 --> 01:36:10,955
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is that?

1059
01:36:11,676 --> 01:36:12,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably...

1060
01:36:14,127 --> 01:36:18,068
[SPEAKER_05]: $70 for the PlayStation 5 version.

1061
01:36:18,088 --> 01:36:20,729
[SPEAKER_02]: See, Nintendo just got their inspiration from the last one.

1062
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:21,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But that came out in 2022.

1063
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, for one, that should have never been $70.

1064
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:28,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, the game originally came out in 2013 on the PlayStation 3.

1065
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:42,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the other reason it's a savings is because they're overcharging for the first one already, and they're going to keep it that way so it makes it like a savings, but it really is not.

1066
01:36:43,618 --> 01:36:44,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote with your wallet, people.

1067
01:36:45,161 --> 01:36:45,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote with your wallet.

1068
01:36:46,123 --> 01:36:46,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So stupid.

1069
01:36:47,614 --> 01:36:49,155
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you got to kick your camera again, Loki.

[SPEAKER_02]: So you just use orangelaundry.com if you want to tag us, which I will say a shout out to SSJ100 Matt, who was kind enough to post a clip from last week's show saying there are three classic blunders.

1086
01:38:02,148 --> 01:38:02,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1087
01:38:22,961 --> 01:38:27,443
[SPEAKER_02]: to folks for clipping the show and doing those sorts of things.

1088
01:38:27,783 --> 01:38:34,406
[SPEAKER_02]: That really goes a long way because, you know, people see that that maybe aren't necessarily subscribed and then they go, oh, this guy's real angry.

1089
01:38:34,786 --> 01:38:35,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to go check him out.

1090

01:38:38,848 --> 01:38:39,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.

1092
01:38:41,829 --> 01:38:44,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, we got a shout out from our pals at Game Buoy, which we appreciate as well.

1093
01:38:45,331 --> 01:38:46,552
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a tag in that.

1094
01:38:46,572 --> 01:38:51,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, if you want to send us a blue sky message at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to do it.

1095
01:38:52,645 --> 01:38:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.

1096
01:38:56,459 --> 01:38:58,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, before we do?

1097
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:24,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna mention it's it's not a huge thing like I know that like the way that the uh websites have been like making it seem like it that's the same um you may remember it was I think Don Matrick a while back said like you know hey if you can't afford you know an Xbox series console Xbox one is for you type of thing you remember that okay I can see why you thought that was a Don Matrick quote but he's been out of the gaming industry or at least the Xbox yeah for a long time okay

1098
01:39:25,649 --> 01:39:26,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I don't care.

1099
01:39:26,649 --> 01:39:27,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's someone on the Xbox.

1100
01:39:45,376 --> 01:39:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Doug Bowser said something recently that's kind of along the same lines to the Washington Post saying that we have an install base for the Switch of 150 million plus units.

1101
01:39:56,301 --> 01:40:00,383
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably announce more on May 8th when we have our next earning call.

1102
01:40:00,984 --> 01:40:02,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to keep those players engaged.

1103
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:05,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them may be ready to jump to Switch 2.

1104
01:40:05,986 --> 01:40:09,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, the way people were phrasing it before was like, oh, he's saying the same thing.

1105
01:40:09,368 --> 01:40:12,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you're too poor for the Switch 2, buy a Switch 1 type thing.

1106
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:13,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1107
01:40:14,164 --> 01:40:26,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't sound like that's necessarily the case here, but yeah, essentially, I mean, if that is what he was trying to say, then no.

1108
01:40:27,315 --> 01:40:30,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't appear to be that.

1109
01:40:30,818 --> 01:40:42,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reeks of let them eat cake, but I will give Doug Bowser's quote one crumb of credit, and that is that at least the Switch is being very well supported still over the next year.

1110
01:40:43,228 --> 01:40:47,552
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot, you know, remember the direct we got the week before the Switch 2 was about the Switch 1.

1111
01:40:48,273 --> 01:40:52,657
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a shit ton of games coming out, including in 2026, that new Tomodachi Life.

1112
01:40:53,178 --> 01:41:02,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least, and I will give him this crumb, at least, you know, if you were to buy a Switch tomorrow, you still have something that's being pretty well supported for another year.

1113
01:41:02,948 --> 01:41:05,911
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, I'm sure indies are going to take that even further than that.

1114
01:41:06,471 --> 01:41:08,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Mike Def points out Rhythm Heaven as well.

1115
01:41:08,432 --> 01:41:12,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, obviously they showed a lot of gay fantasy life is only about a month away.

1116
01:41:12,773 --> 01:41:16,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of things that are still coming out on the original Switch that are going to make people very happy.

1117
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:23,017
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I just, it just, would it kill you to drop the price of the Switch then?

1118
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:26,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's usually what happens when the new phone comes out, the price of the old phone goes down.

1119
01:41:27,628 --> 01:41:27,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1120
01:41:28,469 --> 01:41:28,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1121
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:28,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1122
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:44,450
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1123
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:49,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with that, I'm going to thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1124
01:41:49,253 --> 01:41:50,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for participating with our show.

1125
01:41:51,034 --> 01:41:54,056
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1126
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:55,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a friend or two.

1127
01:41:55,176 --> 01:41:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread the word because, again, yeah, we are that show where every gamer has a voice, and we want to have more voices in the room.

1128
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:05,182
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, YouTube, or Spotify goes an awful long way.

1129
01:42:05,242 --> 01:42:07,544
[SPEAKER_02]: So please don't forget to click that five-star button.

1130
01:42:07,564 --> 01:42:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.

1131
01:42:08,364 --> 01:42:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1132
01:42:10,265 --> 01:42:11,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Help us spread that word.

1133
01:42:11,846 --> 01:42:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media, a little bleat or something goes a very long way as well.

1134
01:42:15,328 --> 01:42:16,229
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate that.

1135
01:42:16,289 --> 01:42:24,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we do post every episode on YouTube, it's something very easy to link and put right into your show feed so people can just click play and check it out.

1136
01:42:24,674 --> 01:42:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really appreciate all that.

1137
01:42:26,355 --> 01:42:28,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

1138
01:42:28,576 --> 01:42:31,417
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura will be back next week.

1139
01:42:32,257 --> 01:42:35,839
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where the Nintendo Switch 2 pricing situation is at in a week.

1140
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Will we have a new pre-order date?

1141
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Will we have a price?

1142
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:40,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, probably not.

1143
01:42:41,341 --> 01:42:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's still too much instability going on in this whole thing.

1144
01:42:45,342 --> 01:42:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if I was Nintendo, I would not want to commit to this still.

1145
01:42:49,944 --> 01:42:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to still be waiting another week.

1146
01:42:52,145 --> 01:42:52,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1147
01:42:52,645 --> 01:42:54,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that and then guess what's going to happen Monday morning?

1148
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: New press release comes out.

1149
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.

1150
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:58,720
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

1151
01:42:59,440 --> 01:42:59,660
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1152
01:43:00,061 --> 01:43:00,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

1153
01:43:00,861 --> 01:43:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we'll go to you with your final thought.

1154
01:43:03,862 --> 01:43:08,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thought is, yeah, just go check out the channel if you haven't yet.

1155
01:43:08,304 --> 01:43:09,085
[SPEAKER_05]: The YouTube channel.

1156
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:11,466
[SPEAKER_05]: LokiLR and YouTube.

1157
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:15,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And my final thought is I should get back into content creation outside this show.

1158
01:43:15,673 --> 01:43:21,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done a YouTube or a personal stream in a long time, but it's because I've actually been... Actually, I looked at my thing today.

1159
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I have averaged 9,000 steps a day this week.

1160
01:43:25,685 --> 01:43:28,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So yesterday I did a little less because of Oreo showing up.

1161
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:31,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of did yesterday as a rest day, but otherwise I have done...

1162
01:43:32,993 --> 01:44:00,123
[SPEAKER_02]: 9,000 average stuff so it took at least 10,000 if not 11,000 every other day to make up for yesterday so today I think I'm up to about 12,000 um but it feels it feels great and I got my Pokemon not Pokemon Pikmin Bloom Badge although I've been playing a shit ton of Pokemon Go again like just having the Bluetooth while I walk is so I keep running out of Pokeballs thank god I have the new one that will let you throw great balls and let you throw ultra balls so I can stock up on the red ones too while I walk but um

1163
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been good to be prioritizing walking again, but it has meant some of my other things have taken a hit.

1164
01:44:07,526 --> 01:44:11,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess on a personal note, I'm also very excited.

1165
01:44:12,367 --> 01:44:13,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting a new job tomorrow.

1166
01:44:14,768 --> 01:44:15,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Same company.

1167
01:44:15,468 --> 01:44:16,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

1168
01:44:16,149 --> 01:44:16,449

[SPEAKER_02]: Same company.

1170
01:44:17,609 --> 01:44:41,455
[SPEAKER_02]: all that it's just it's a promotional opportunity uh really thrilled about it obviously I don't like to say a lot a lot because some people on the internet are a little crazy when it comes to um you know trying to find people uh so I don't like to say a lot a lot about my day job but I do really enjoy the environment where I work and I'm really excited to in fact my boss has listened to this show that should tell you a lot about what they're willing to put up with there

1171
01:44:44,235 --> 01:44:50,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going to be taking on a new role and I'm really excited about it and really happy and thrilled about it.

1172
01:44:50,497 --> 01:44:51,057
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1173
01:44:52,277 --> 01:44:55,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, a new adventure in many different ways tomorrow.

[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll talk to you again in seven days.

1175

[SPEAKER_02]: Until then, I will give Oreo lots of pets for you all and Cheddar as well.
