9918	13161	I gave some thought to rerunning an intro for the first time in the show's history.
13322	21810	Although I was sick at the time I recorded it, I wasn't sick enough that I couldn't have recorded a full intro, but my voice was still scratchy at the time, but it wasn't an indication of my ability to put in more effort.
21870	28938	I'm not sick now, not for lack of vocal fry when I get into my deeper, dulcet tones and incredibly close to the mic.
29238	31000	Whoops, maybe I should have re-ran the intro.
31160	33082	At least then I would have actually referenced gaming news.
33262	34683	Go Direct wasn't an April Fool.
34944	41370	Now it's time for your hosts, Rub Rubber, it's Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about the Switch 2, Nintendo Direct, and the rest of some gaming news.
41630	44052	Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a place.
45495	52980	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
53100	56082	I'm laughing because I don't know what Jason was doing with that intro, but it was really funny.
56943	67109	Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1041 of our show for tonight, April the 6th of 2025.
67590	75415	My name is Rob Roberts, and I do want to get right into the news here pretty quickly, but I couldn't do that if I didn't say hello first to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
78697	85860	Jamie, one thing I want to ask you here at the top of the show is is that new killer in Dead by Daylight breaking the game?
89562	99468	I'm tired of him already at least when I played had nothing but him but there's some OP stuff about this character that has been addressed by a number of
100774	103996	Upper Echelon, DBD People
126923	131987	On a scale of one to five stars, what would you give the Minecraft movie?
133728	134488	At least four stars.
134868	136049	At least four stars.
136269	136590	All right.
136830	137470	That's pretty good.
137570	138111	That's not bad.
138511	140292	That's like a B. That's a solid B.
142338	144959	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
160327	161868	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
181696	183658	So let's start off at the top here.
183778	187021	Loki, I'm going to turn it over to you to give us the news rundowns.
187401	192826	But could we talk about the two things that people are talking about the most after that direct?
193106	194788	And they both revolve around the price.
195288	198912	Can we talk about, first, the price of the system and the price of the games?
200051	208513	Yeah, so the price of the system is $450 for just the system itself, only the system.
209073	216736	And then they're also doing a limited time bundle with Mario Kart World Tour, which is the brand new Mario Kart game, for $499.
216776	217996	At least that's in the US.
222137	235320	Europe similar pricing in Japan the pricing is much lower due to the weak yen there apparently but that is basically the price point it's close to a digital version of the PlayStation 5.
238261	244603	On top of that Mario Kart World Tour the launch game for the Switch 2
246127	257319	is retailing at $80 essentially, or $70 digital, $80 physical, although some regions it's $80 and $90.
257479	263946	Wait, I had heard it was $80 for both, that it's $80 digital, $80 physical as well.
265683	267465	I think it's more for physical.
267986	271751	This is a big problem like that Nintendo has right now.
272112	279101	Nintendo screwed up big time, big time by not being more transparent about the pricing in the direct.
279161	280263	And I understand.
280443	281965	I know before y'all come at me and chat.
282265	288989	I understand that Direct has to be in the can for weeks in advance so that it gets the legal review so that they get everything prepped.
289229	291231	And there was a lot of instability going on in the world.
291471	294513	I understand there's certain things that Nintendo has to have.
294893	299356	But then that also kind of makes me go, well, should Nintendo maybe have done it live?
299776	302179	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
316716	318838	Everybody is filling in the gaps.
319278	321940	And I've said this time and time again on Orange Lounge Radio.
322360	329045	This is a truth that we have to accept about our industry, the gaming industry, that is so extraordinarily frustrating.
329566	332888	Is that the truth doesn't matter.
334089	335750	The truth doesn't matter.
336391	341815	The perception of the news, the perception of the truth is what matters.
342711	344033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
362275	367379	As I was doing later that evening, I was brain rotting on TikTok, which a lot of us do sometimes.
367440	369161	Brain rotting on whatever app it is of your choice.
369541	377568	I was brain rotting on TikTok, and I saw the TikToks where people were like, I can't believe that Mario Kart World Tour is going to be $90 if you want a cartridge.
378274	379014	Wait, wait, wait.
379394	380215	It's not going to be $90.
380535	386077	You can actually go... And I saw a bleat on Blue Sky from somebody I know very well.
386897	388257	I can't believe Mario Kart's going to be $90.
388317	393899	And I linked the Best Buy screenshot where it's $80 for the physical edition of the game.
394139	394860	We don't know!
395740	399504	because Nintendo really fucked up not being clear.
399945	409515	And I understand the situation is extraordinarily complicated and it's fluid, but unfortunately the reality of the situation is now perception has taken over.
410698	414561	We barely know what the price is.
415862	418283	We know that the MSRP is $79.99.
418343	422846	Now, we don't know if that's digital only or if that's going to be a physical edition.
423427	426409	But right now, it is $79.99.
427029	428350	Doesn't matter how you slice it.
430531	432973	Whether it's digital or physical doesn't matter.
432993	433773	$79.99 is $10 more...
437992	462864	Yes, they have They have broken that ceiling They have pushed, and yeah, I think a lot of people were not expecting that to come from Nintendo From the bottom of my heart, let me be the first to say to Nintendo Not the first, I'm sure, but let me be another person to say to Nintendo Absolutely, wholeheartedly, go fuck yourselves
463864	484114	100% fuck yourselves with the sharpest fucking rigidity shit that you have because god damn it you fucking just ruined the god damn game industry by saying oh hey Ubisoft threw shitty fucking Assassin's Creed games now those are gonna be $80 because Nintendo said it was okay so now we get to fucking just open that gate fuck you guys fuck you
485988	488971	Some orange turd who decided tariffs were a good idea.
489412	494638	I get you that you want to blame tariffs, but other games, even on their own platform, are $70, $80.
495639	496940	No, it is Nintendo.
497020	500965	It is Nintendo because it's not like that they live in a bubble and didn't know that tariffs are coming.
501305	502286	And that aside...
503107	508689	Other regions of the world where there are no tariffs from the United States, it is still that price.
509109	509749	Fuck them.
510069	510649	Fuck them.
511070	511630	Fuck them.
511730	512290	Seriously.
512750	514691	Fuck them with this bullshit.
514911	517131	It's fucking greed and it's bullshit.
517372	518812	And they need to fuck themselves.
518932	520112	And I hope they pay for this.
520493	521833	Honestly, I hope they pay for this.
522093	525674	Because it will affect... This is going to be fucking PlayStation 3 all over the fuck again.
527495	529535	In a recession in the worldwide.
529875	531176	Seriously, fuck them.
533197	536298	I do want to address a couple comments in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night.
536378	542061	The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
542441	550304	Okay, Deft in chat says, yeah, Nintendo did fuck up, but I think it's wrong of us that Nintendo is only to blame here.
551384	552685	Yes and no.
553385	559428	And Deft was commenting, I want to say that comment was kind of timed when I was talking about the messaging.
560148	564130	I still believe Nintendo could have done a better job messaging in spite of the situation.
564190	566531	And I think a lot of it is what you hear Loki say.
567071	576035	in his passionate voice there about, great, you've done Shattered the Glass Ceiling, this all but guarantees Grand Theft Auto 6 will be $80, if not more.
576395	580597	This all but guarantees other Ubisoft games and other games, they're going to be $80.
580717	583398	Go ahead.
583838	584258	Never mind.
584538	585819	Glass Ceiling doesn't apply here.
586259	589920	Well, Shattered the Ceiling of price or whatever it is.
590461	593382	Well, I say that because there was this...
594525	599990	This sort of unspoken, we're not going above this price and you can't charge this much for a video game.
600290	600970	But now you can.
601911	606035	It's not even so much that Nintendo is charging it for their game.
606135	610539	It's basically giving the game industry permission to just fuck the consumer some more.
611099	615423	And it was already ridiculous enough and we were already pushing it back against it with PlayStation 5.
615783	622789	At least there you could justify that, oh, it's the 4K visuals that they need to push for these higher spec systems.
623149	624430	The Switch 2 ain't that.
624530	629132	The Switch 2 is fucking a generation or two back, okay?
629253	631574	Imagine a PlayStation 4 game coming out for $80 retail.
635570	642133	It's just... If Sony released Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4 for $80, everybody would be telling the fuck themselves.
642614	643714	It's just ridiculous.
643774	645775	And we give Nintendo a pass all the time.
646195	647656	I'm not giving Nintendo a pass.
648096	648576	I get it.
649017	652118	I would love to play the new Mario Kart game, but this is ridiculous.
652418	654679	It is way too... It's priced way too high.
655140	658621	And yeah, Trump's tariffs are only going to make that even higher.
659081	659602	It's just...
660462	678364	read the fucking room like the reason the switch did so well is because it was one of the lower price systems and that's how you got away with it but now you're just cash you're just pulling like some of these higher end you know electronics things where it's like well we've got the built-in consumer they'll pay whatever we want they'll they'll eat whatever we give them like it's just
679085	698162	you gotta say no at some point you gotta just push back and let them go through this as like they did with the 3DS where that flopped initially and then they had to re the pivot and kind of make amends there because I honestly I think a lot of these game companies need to kind of have a comeuppance so this greed just goes away because it's getting ridiculous
698803	701325	Because it's not just... Because I get it with Nintendo.
701345	704368	It's like, yeah, you get a full complete package usually for their games.
704388	705649	They don't have a ton of DLC.
705669	706830	It's usually pretty meaningful.
707350	709332	Once again, this isn't a Nintendo problem.
709352	719501	This is going to be a game industry problem because now you have Ubisoft that's going to get... You're going to get EA, Sports, Madden coming out the door at $80 fucking dollars plus all the bullshit that they add on top of that.
719661	725746	And then they're going to be like, we don't have enough money while raking in billions of dollars and giving their fucking CEOs hundreds of millions of dollars.
726127	726607	Fuck that.
726847	727548	Nintendo.
727848	729369	Fuck this game industry, actually.
729709	730129	Fuck them.
730369	731690	All of them.
733311	736913	Believe it or not, there's actually a large portion of what Loki's saying I agree with.
737633	738914	And that might surprise you.
739154	742016	I usually try to be pretty measured in these types of situations.
743196	748859	But I do think this $80 is not going to be great news at the end of the day for the industry.
748979	750961	And I have seen the...
752461	763968	And I've seen the kind of the first line of defense that sometimes the Nintendo defenders are using in this situation about, well, the cartridges that we were buying in the 90s were, you know, such and such.
763988	770411	A Chrono Trigger was $100 or, you know, whatever, you know, cartridges had all this meat packed into $100 at this time.
770431	771772	But here's the thing.
772472	785377	and ding, ding, ding, a gold star comment as far as I'm concerned in this chat to Deft, who said the real problem isn't the games going up, it's our wages not going up.
786277	796421	That's where the comparison breaks down for me, is because if you look at what the minimum wage was then and what the minimum wage is now, there's a huge discrepancy there.
796881	800765	And to be fair, this is indicative of a problem outside the gaming industry.
800825	807412	And I also see the talk about the budgets for the video games going up and that it costs more to make a video game.
807892	814699	Whilst I do understand that, it's a very hard pill to swallow when there isn't more money going into our pockets.
815480	819664	And yeah, we have to be able to have teams of...
821208	825071	And I don't know if that's AI that helps with that.
825312	829095	That's not generative in nature, but tools and learn.
829435	830016	I don't know.
830376	834419	But this industry is headed for further disaster in this direction.
834799	836321	And I fully believe it.
837267	838468	Let's be honest though.
838988	839668	Let's look at this.
839788	844251	So yes, we want to make the argument that games in the past were more expensive.
844631	846492	But let's look at the reality of that is.
846932	851735	Yes, the upfront cost of a game back then was maybe a bit more expensive.
852055	854577	But you got a complete game with that.
855017	858159	Whereas now, everything is piecemealed out of it.
858359	863982	Your entry point at these games is now getting to the point what those old complete games were.
864242	868604	But no, that's not the complete game because then you gotta buy the fucking Battle Pass.
868964	873746	That's a monthly subscription to unlock bullshit that would have normally been free.
874107	876868	Oh, and then you got your special editions on top of all that.
877088	880210	And then you got your DLC and your consumables on top of all of that.
880470	882131	So no, it is not just like...
882751	884451	There's an even deeper core to this.
912182	918192	Yeah, and even if we're talking like cartridges cost more to manufacture, okay, give me a discount on the digital game then.
918853	920135	Oh wait, it's the same price?
920916	925263	No, there's an even deeper core to deal- to do with this, and it's just the whole nature of capitalism.
927418	928018	Please elaborate.
928179	934643	The absolute nature of capitalism and how rampant and unchecked it's become in this country.
935143	945030	And the fact that some of these working protections that we have are now being rolled back, which is going to make things even worse for people trying to earn that living wage like Rob was mentioning.
946131	949634	This is a...
951440	965227	and I hate to draw the comparison but history has taught us look at the origins of the French Revolution about how that loaded up and it all came from the fact that you had a very separated and
966465	967086	and many more.
990063	1008910	And when you're dealing with this kind of disparaging income and the fact that now they are tooling things where they stand to make money from the actions, from the damage that the tariffs will cause the consumer.
1009871	1012892	It's a whole lot of economic theory I'll have to go into and we don't have time on the show.
1013905	1039069	but that being said we are heading to that breaking point and the companies they don't see they just think they're gonna buy it our name is on it they're gonna buy it our name is on it or there's you know FOMO is gonna sell these systems you know and it might I mean honestly it might I mean it's
1040236	1053876	I just think like $79.99 would have been more or like you know $69.99 would have been more palatable because at least then you'd be like okay well this is just where the industry's going everybody's raising their prices to that but then to take it even further come on
1054656	1063863	But there's also, though, these people who are, you know, going to think like, you know, like there are people out there who say, okay, this is a natural progression.
1063903	1064944	This is what inflation is.
1064984	1066365	We've been through this cycle before.
1066845	1067766	This is nothing new.
1068286	1070588	And to an extent, it is nothing new.
1070888	1072890	It is, we saw it coming.
1073510	1075492	We had hoped it wouldn't, but we saw it coming.
1076312	1081196	We just didn't, I reckon, as a group, think it was going to happen so soon.
1081997	1082117	And
1083097	1089183	People will fuss, people will complain, and ultimately, they will still buy it.
1091525	1094128	And as long as that happens, nothing is going to change.
1095319	1095940	That is true.
1096160	1101804	People have to vote with their wallets, but I feel like this situation is going to continue to escalate, and I think people will.
1102265	1108050	Nintendo infamously is a company that does not put games on sale, but I will say this.
1108070	1114555	So there's two things I want to say because – let me say this, and then I want to get into where I actually disagree with Loki because I'm sure you all want to hear that.
1115056	1123162	So this is the one thing is that we – one thing we don't have on the table because we don't know what it looks like yet is what –
1123843	1126044	What deals are we going to get on these $80 games?
1126224	1132727	Meaning, we all know that you can work the Costco system to get $100 of Nintendo cards for $90, at least today.
1133007	1136428	That's one way you can save a buck on a game, because games are starting to push that price anyway.
1137048	1142410	Another way you could save is that it used to be that if you had Nintendo Switch Online, you could get the...
1146692	1170381	the voucher that would let you get two games and it was reduced price and so we don't know if any of those things are going to help swallow the pill of this and I would tell you if these games don't sell the way that Nintendo expects them to we'll probably see more of those types of deals and again I also want to emphasize you know the price of Mario Kart World is one thing but what really gets me
1171636	1172657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1193112	1201755	but otherwise on its own for a new consumer who doesn't have Breath of the Wild, which I really don't know who that is at this point, but we'll say there's somebody out there that doesn't.
1202595	1215799	Asking them to pay $80 for Breath of the Wild in the year 2025, that's like Bethesda putting out a Skyrim Switch 2 edition saying we have a few extra quests, we have a phone app that goes with it, and they're going to charge you $80 for that.
1217677	1221980	That's a big pill for Nintendo to swallow.
1222681	1227665	And on top of that, I saw a side-by-side with the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions.
1228806	1230447	I honestly couldn't tell them apart.
1230627	1232048	They looked the same.
1232969	1239174	And being that these Switch 2 editions are essentially, it's a Switch 1 game and a voucher to download that update.
1239374	1240135	That's all it is.
1241337	1247946	Here's where I start to disagree with Loki and even myself a little bit, because here's the thing.
1248066	1250189	I realize optics are a big thing in play, right?
1250249	1251430	It's that whole perception thing.
1252302	1255883	I would actually argue many of you are already paying $80 for a video game.
1256483	1271748	You're already paying this price because so many companies out there, not only with their limited edition, legacy edition, you know, will find ways to jack the price up all the way to like $100 if you want to get, you know, the early access for its edition, all this stuff.
1272168	1277150	Not just that, but the fact that consider this, that Nintendo...
1277910	1278450	It's only a dream.
1296821	1302586	It's not a Fuji Television Rights thing because Nintendo has re-put out Mario 2 several times.
1302626	1306849	And I say Fuji Television because of Doki Doki Panic and where that all came from.
1306869	1307630	That was the characters.
1307670	1308830	But anyway, I digress.
1309711	1319679	Any other company, any other company, Ubisoft especially, I'm trying to think of who else especially, but especially Ubisoft.
1319719	1321761	I'm going to pick on them because EA would be another one.
1322401	1337684	would have put out Mario Kart World Tour for $70 and then had the $10 character packs, five of them with five characters each and maybe have 25 in the game and then the extra packs that will be for sale with that.
1338085	1343966	And then if you want to unlock the special cup, that's also going to be a $15 piece of DLC and da-da-da-da-da.
1345020	1353523	Nintendo, and it's not that Nintendo doesn't do DLC, obviously they do, and I fully expect that Mario Kart World will probably have some of its own and so forth.
1353983	1361945	But I do feel like where Nintendo has proven themselves is that the DLC that Nintendo releases tends to be the best value for the dollar.
1361985	1365867	I think the only one I thought was kind of mid was Splatoon.
1366527	1369288	Otherwise, the DLC that Nintendo releases is usually...
1370288	1371629	It's enough to substantiate it.
1372150	1373952	So, I mean, but I understand.
1373992	1377996	At the end of the day, it's the optics of the $80 price that is really bad.
1378376	1384902	But I just feel like in another universe, Nintendo puts out Mario Kart World Tour with half the characters, then charges to the DLC.
1385203	1386444	And is that really any different?
1388934	1390475	Yeah, it's not any different.
1390755	1394237	But once again, we're still giving them the benefit of the doubt.
1394857	1396338	But now they've gone and done this.
1396418	1398159	So who knows what they're capable of right now.
1398679	1404322	To be honest, because we thought that it was going to be reasonably priced and everything.
1404362	1410565	And then they went and said, hey, let's play a game and see how many of these we can sell for $80.
1411546	1412986	And so now they're going to do that.
1413607	1416188	And who knows what they're going to do on top of it.
1416288	1417689	I don't know what their plan is, but...
1420125	1423227	I can't, I can't, I now have to lump them in with everybody else.
1423527	1425689	Unfortunately, just because that's the way it is.
1426009	1435335	I just feel it was extremely a missed opportunity on Nintendo's part to not communicate why they felt the price of the game needed to go up.
1436055	1442579	Why, you know, and that could have even been damage control that they do after the fact in interviews and things like that.
1442679	1446442	But we haven't really had a comment on that issue.
1447242	1452886	Which again is leading to the internet completely filling in the gap and making it up.
1453927	1460971	I want to present something because this is the type of behavior online that I'm so tired of.
1461011	1462232	And I will get to your comments in chat.
1462272	1463133	I'm sorry I see you guys.
1463153	1465494	But I have to rant about something real quick, okay?
1466275	1467636	I want to show you this Reddit.
1468356	1473000	This is the Reddit for gaming news where they post a bunch of headlines and you see things that get upvoted.
1473020	1473620	Okay.
1473940	1482306	One of the items that's on this Reddit is... Every first-party Nintendo Switch 2 game will cost $70 or $80, even the old ones, okay?
1482807	1488250	Nintendo cites upgrades, inflation, and tariffs as reasons for the higher prices.
1488751	1491233	And this is from a website called techspot.com.
1491653	1494135	And I was drawn to this headline because I said, wait a minute...
1494875	1496516	Nintendo has commented on this?
1497237	1498058	I was not aware.
1498318	1501641	I want to see what Nintendo is saying about that $80.
1502401	1504743	And sure enough, you go to the site, it's the same headline.
1505124	1508666	Every first party Nintendo Switch 2 game will cost $70 or $80, even the old ones.
1509147	1513110	Nintendo cites upgrades, inflation, and tariffs as reason for the higher prices.
1513330	1514191	Just checking my eyes.
1514391	1518134	That headline on this site does say Nintendo is citing this, right?
1518755	1519355	We all see that.
1519475	1519716	Okay.
1520643	1523844	Then as I'm moving down, I'm reading through the story.
1524505	1526886	Okay, so Nintendo is going to charge $80 for games.
1527326	1528807	Shocking news about Mario Kart World is $80.
1529027	1531648	Okay, third-party titles will have varied pricing.
1531728	1532228	Okay, okay.
1532568	1534249	Nintendo Scheme for updating.
1534289	1534990	We'll take this.
1535050	1536310	Okay, like PlayStation 5.
1536630	1537071	Okay, okay.
1537371	1539912	Microsoft and third-party developers release upgrade patches.
1539972	1540672	Sony charges $10.
1541072	1542233	Okay, okay, we know that.
1542573	1542813	Civ 7.
1542973	1543634	Okay, we know that.
1544674	1550095	Nintendo didn't specify the price for Switch to Switch 2 conversions, but the difference is $10 to $20.
1550155	1551515	Okay, okay, right, okay.
1553035	1555396	I'm still looking for Nintendo citing this.
1556616	1565658	Furthermore, inflation alone could account for most or all the differences between AAA games that sold for $70 a few years ago and $80 Switch 2 games in 2025.
1566498	1569318	According to labor statistics, $70 in 2021 or 2022 could equal between $75 or $80 today.
1569458	1569638	Okay, okay.
1574359	1578864	I'm still trying to get to that part of the story where Nintendo is citing the upgrades, inflation, or tariffs.
1578924	1580986	Okay, let's see, let's see.
1582727	1594759	The 24% tariff on Nintendo's home country, Japan, and 46% tax on goods from Vietnam, where the firm shifted switch to manufacturing to avoid anti-Chinese duties, could be particularly troublesome.
1595259	1605067	Nintendo has likely already shipped many units into the US ahead of the tariffs, and Trump has wavered on the practice before, but the company is seemingly hedging its bets in an increasingly chaotic market.
1605687	1615234	Okay, but that's... Okay, Nintendo, that's reading into the news in, I think, what is a reasonable way, but that's not Nintendo actually commenting on it, right?
1615615	1615815	Okay.
1615835	1616015	Okay.
1616416	1619740	Avoiding tariffs by building Switch 2s in the US is also untenable.
1620181	1625088	Analysts say building factories and hiring personnel would take five years and then the consoles would still cost more.
1625148	1625348	Sure.
1625909	1629273	It remains unclear how or if the video game industry will respond.
1629313	1631577	A heavier focus on digital marketplace would be unsurprising.
1632037	1632979	That's the end of the article.
1634534	1635295	That's the end of the article.
1635335	1635716	Wait a minute.
1636196	1638319	Loki, I just kind of ran through the article there.
1638579	1646209	Did you, correct me if I'm wrong, did you hear anything in there about Nintendo actually citing upgrades, inflation, and tariffs?
1646289	1648773	Did you hear anything where Nintendo actually said something in that?
1649915	1653776	No, what I heard was, sucker, you bought our Clickbait headline.
1654176	1654836	That's right.
1655076	1659998	That's right, y'all, because, again, let's go back to Reddit, where this originally came from.
1660438	1664279	I want to show you 160 comments.
1664299	1665539	146 people upvoted this.
1665900	1670821	If you go to the article itself, you have 36 comments, or no, 26 comments, 468 likes and shares.
1676397	1677238	Thanks for watching!
1698650	1702092	And yes, I understand, Tigerclaw in chat, Reddit isn't reliable as a news source.
1702472	1708175	That's why I'm telling you the numbers of people that are spreading this like wildfire because it isn't fucking true.
1709155	1712197	And this is the stuff that is spreading everywhere.
1712957	1714658	Y'all need to stop and critically think.
1716199	1719441	There is no comment from Nintendo on this, and that is the problem.
1721340	1722862	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1739028	1741128	It did, and people don't think at all.
1741209	1741449	Think.
1741749	1743189	Critical or not, people don't think.
1743249	1743929	They don't want to think.
1743949	1745710	They don't want to do the research for themselves.
1746990	1761993	This is where all of you, me, all of you listening, all of you on websites like Reddit, all of you on Blue Sky, all of you that for whatever god-awful reason are still on Twitter, all of you that are on Facebook, all of it, this is what you all need to do better.
1762974	1764594	Stop sharing this shit.
1766007	1770588	and StopRewardingTechSpot for making shit up, literally.
1775449	1777350	Because it's not doing anybody any favors.
1779410	1783071	Now, here's the part that really shocked me in a good way.
1783991	1784971	Let's go back to Reddit.
1786111	1788232	I know y'all are mad that I'm getting my news from Reddit.
1789651	1794580	Reddit is, again, I could go to Blue Sky and I would see that same article being shared.
1794680	1796924	I could go to Twitter and I would see that same article being shared.
1797264	1801933	Reddit is one of many barometers about what people are talking about online, whether you like it or not.
1803422	1807305	There's another article that's been shared, also funny enough, uploaded 146 times.
1808026	1813410	Trump tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on games industry, says U.S.
1813490	1813991	Trade Group.
1814391	1825320	This one goes to Eurogamer, which is a website that I trust a lot more based on track record to not be doing the AI drivel and to not do these clickbait headlines because they open it right off saying...
1825580	1836563	The Entertainment Software Association, which represents all major gaming companies in the U.S., has responded to the Trump tariffs, saying the measures will have a real and detrimental impact on the game industry.
1836823	1846905	And they link to the actual game file source here where ESA Senior Vice President Aubrey Quinn mentioned in an interview that the tariffs, quote,
1847165	1849889	Thank you to Eurogamer for having the integrity to cite your source.
1864727	1865107	DarkSakura.com
1880973	1881894	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1909554	1914098	Loki, what is the second headline about what the tariffs are doing to the Nintendo Switch situation?
1916060	1916961	The second headline?
1918903	1925028	Well, they've basically stopped the pre-orders because now the tariffs are going on.
1925048	1929472	They have to basically reevaluate what I guess to charge everything.
1931034	1933896	But it's still supposed to come out on June 5th.
1935856	1936177	At least.
1936277	1939266	So that hasn't changed, but who knows when that's going to pre-order.
1939286	1941994	Because originally it's supposed to start on Wednesday, on the 9th.
1944887	1956658	So, yeah, the whole pre-orders are going to happen, and now they're not, because... And this is the part to the comment that was said much earlier, how much of this is really Nintendo's fault.
1956718	1967769	And this is the part where it's like, yeah, this is just shitty timing, and the only fault Nintendo made was not getting this console out sooner, which I understand, you want to have the good games and all this stuff.
1968129	1979198	But the reality is now they literally put out a Nintendo Direct the same day that our government decided to implement tariffs on nations based on an algorithm.
1980339	1991668	And don't try and convince me this was not algorithm or AI or otherwise based because if it wasn't, we wouldn't be putting tariffs on the fucking Penguin Islands or whatever they're called in Australia.
1991708	1993009	Or the U.S.
1993069	1993369	base.
1993469	1995631	Where there isn't any fucking people working.
1995811	1997393	What are they importing from that island?
1997453	1998073	Penguin meat?
1998253	1999555	I don't think that's allowed.
2000055	2000996	There's nothing.
2001697	2003018	So that's how you know.
2003558	2009364	That's how you know somebody who actually knows what they're talking about did not proofread this.
2009944	2015289	And that fucking somebody typed into Grok or one of those bullshit AI things.
2015610	2019794	How do I tariff other countries in this whole thing?
2021426	2024509	Nintendo could not have called that that news would have come out the same day.
2024989	2026931	I'm going to give them a pass on that.
2028432	2032455	And now this whole situation... It's homophobia against gay penguins.
2034177	2047508	The whole thing is so fucked because Nintendo, you may recall, moved a good chunk of their production of hardware out of China into Vietnam to get around the first round of Trump tariffs.
2047548	2049750	The first time that targeted China.
2050310	2051471	They moved them to Vietnam.
2051491	2052091	Well, guess what?
2052872	2066222	Now Trump wants to target Vietnam with a 46% tariff, which has, again, the clickbait hysteria leading to $650 or $700 Nintendo Switch 2s, which at least is rooted in math.
2067183	2074809	You know, I mean, nobody can really boil down exactly what parts are coming from where into which countries and imports and how that's all going to boil down.
2075209	2076190	That would require...
2076570	2078131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2096454	2098375	This is the type of news that changes on a whim.
2098995	2101516	I fully expect we will come back to this show.
2101556	2104017	And maybe this is just false hope, silly hope.
2104057	2106419	But I just feel like this is how our government works now.
2106839	2107859	And change my mind.
2107959	2108660	Please feel free.
2109180	2111461	I feel like we're going to come back here in seven days.
2112422	2116424	And does Vietnam have a prime minister or president?
2116764	2117484	I actually don't know.
2117664	2118185	Sorry, everybody.
2118205	2120146	I can't keep track of every country in the world and their government.
2120386	2122247	Does Vietnam have a prime minister or president?
2122927	2133137	Whoever the leader, whoever the de facto leader of Vietnam is in the next seven days will have kissed Trump's ring and kissed his ass on social media and convinced the administration to remove that tariff.
2133437	2135519	And this this thing is going to be a nonstop.
2135599	2137481	That's what I really, truly think is going to happen.
2137521	2141004	Maybe not in seven days, but I would say in like two weeks, maybe.
2141985	2143306	And Bobby says they already have.
2143366	2144307	It's a prime minister.
2144347	2148651	And I guess, again, deals being brokered on social media because that's the government you elected.
2152802	2161728	So I don't think that... Going back to your comment about algorithm for the record, I also think that there's quite a bit of bias involved in the choice of countries for this.
2161928	2162429	Oh, I'm sure.
2162669	2163169	Oh, I'm sure.
2165431	2169493	Oh, Bobby actually gives me a link here to look at this.
2169894	2170254	Except...
2174037	2176439	It won't let me read it unless I have a subscription.
2176519	2180103	So I only have the headline here that says, Vietnam ready to remove U.S.
2180163	2183285	import tariffs as it seeks to delay Trump's 46% levy.
2183946	2187849	And apparently there was a meeting between the ambassador, U.S.
2187889	2190912	ambassador to Vietnam and Vietnam's minister of foreign affairs on Sunday.
2190952	2199419	So it's already, and I'm sure there are many governments around the world, like I said, and maybe that was the plan, right?
2200216	2202438	Question mark, I say as if there's ever a plan.
2203698	2207581	I am not going to profess to be able to think like these people that are running our government.
2207681	2208762	I don't know what they're doing.
2209843	2214386	But the stock market seems to indicate a lot of people don't think they know what they're doing.
2215606	2217828	So we'll see what the situation looks like in seven days.
2217888	2222271	But I would argue, no matter how you slice it, let's say this issue is gone in seven days.
2222971	2224713	This is going to cause supply issues.
2225453	2227415	Supply issues are already going to happen.
2227956	2244352	And even when Nintendo has probably taken steps to get around those issues by already having Switch 2s in this country ready to go, the problem is that there's going to be a stoppage of bringing more into this country to sit in warehouses and go out to store shelves and be distributed.
2244592	2247334	This is going to cause a stoppage of that for weeks.
2248015	2248536	and DarkSakura.
2265094	2265935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2285606	2288149	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2306687	2311831	You bet your ass you're going to be hearing this from Sony and you're going to hear this from Microsoft as well.
2312191	2323159	They just have a little bit, you know, because the supply is already out there and their product isn't quite in high demand right this moment, they have the luxury of being able to kind of wait this out a little more than Nintendo does.
2325748	2328510	and SSJ100Matt goes to elections have consequences.
2328590	2329371	Yes, they do.
2329831	2339639	And for all of you that said, I'm doing my Twitch stream and I don't talk about politics on my Twitch stream because we need to keep politics out of video games and we need to, the politics shouldn't touch the video games.
2339739	2341160	Well, guess what?
2341600	2342061	Guess what?
2343001	2348285	It was always inevitable that politics was going to be tied to your video games.
2348786	2350947	It was always inevitable.
2351808	2352449	And maybe,
2353519	2355699	Maybe gamers needed this to happen.
2356180	2356860	I hate to say it.
2357380	2359620	I hate watching a lot of this stuff that's playing out.
2360200	2363921	I don't know how the fuck people are going to wake up until it hurts them personally.
2363961	2366662	Because unfortunately, that seems to be the way this country works.
2367282	2370363	People do not give a shit until it affects them personally.
2370803	2371663	Then they give a shit.
2372883	2378024	So maybe the price of the Switch 2 will finally be the thing that fucking radicalizes you.
2378404	2379545	Welcome to the resistance.
2379625	2380545	We've been waiting for you.
2387250	2387570	I'm done.
2388691	2388971	Alright.
2390271	2395873	Well, let's talk a little bit more about what exactly was announced regarding the Switch 2.
2397614	2400315	We know the price and we know that we're not happy with it.
2401475	2405797	But, specs wise, it is going to be a pretty decent piece of kit.
2405977	2409138	It's got a larger, pretty much everything's improved.
2409218	2411399	Larger screen, so a 7.9 inch screen.
2411659	2412519	It can do up to 4K.
2412539	2412639	The
2415560	2415961	and DarkSakura.com
2435744	2452140	and uh yeah 256 gigabytes of storage the system itself is basically the same uh size as the original switch obviously a little bit bigger but not thicker um on top of that and it will support uh switch one games although
2453940	2455881	Not everything.
2455981	2460582	And the reason for that is it's not actually playing it on the native hardware, it's emulating it.
2460862	2469565	And so there's already 120 Switch games that have compatibility issues that they're still working on getting fixed.
2469905	2471646	So that is something to expect.
2473126	2476487	But none of them are Nintendo first party games.
2476608	2476948	None of them.
2477448	2477888	Correct.
2477928	2480309	And a lot of them are very like...
2481752	2486355	Fortnite is one of them, but there's going to be a separate Fortnite Switch 2 client anyway.
2487976	2492098	If you want the Fortnite Switch 1 client on your Switch 2, I question your logic.
2492458	2496940	So there are several games in there where I'm just like, okay, it doesn't work, whatever.
2497420	2500922	And the games you care about the most, Nintendo first-party games, are all going to be fine.
2501382	2505765	So it's kind of a non-issue to me, except for things like Labo.
2505885	2507866	But again, I feel like if you're like, I'm...
2508286	2510367	I'm upset because Labo won't work on Switch 2.
2510567	2512588	Like, you're trying to break the system, dude.
2513109	2522274	Obviously, the specs for this thing are different and Labo involves, you know, physical things that were for the size of those old Joy-Cons and that has changed.
2522454	2529998	Technically, Labo could work for some of that because the original Joy-Cons are compatible with the system.
2530058	2531659	You can use them for games.
2532139	2534320	So, technically, some of that would work.
2534480	2535781	The VR, no.
2535961	2537062	Obviously, it would not.
2537242	2537542	But let's
2538024	2545631	If you are buying a Switch 2 to play Labo, I need you to stop and think about your money.
2545672	2546833	Maybe you should open a CD.
2547834	2548554	I don't know what to tell you.
2548715	2549355	Anyway, go ahead.
2550276	2552859	The battery life for the Switch 2 isn't going to be better.
2553779	2559165	It's estimated to run 2 to 6.5 hours on a single charge, depending on what games you're playing.
2560326	2560786	So that's...
2561966	2562366	Something.
2563267	2571250	And then on top of that, we do know that the Joysticks, of course, the Analog Sticks is always a concern with Drift.
2571630	2576313	Those are supposed to be Hall Effect switches now, or sticks, so at least that should be
2577578	2603966	uh the drift issues should be gone there and also they promise that the e-shop will be better well I mean it can only get better well I do getting worse would be a choice it could yes it should be getting better because that's a very low bar of the hit um but they they do promise that it will be better than what it is on top of that they also showed off uh there was a this uh
2605376	2605636	Which is so...
2621587	2621887	Stupid.
2621907	2622407	It should be.
2622427	2622628	Yeah.
2643424	2644465	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
2660203	2664105	and the justification for that is... Oh, you did mention this briefly early on, Loki.
2664145	2675572	You said that in Japan, they are getting a cheaper Nintendo Switch 2 because of the value of the yen, although maybe some of that is tariff-related too because, you know, Japan doesn't have those same tariffs.
2675692	2675792	And...
2676172	2683494	But it is a highly restrictive Switch 2, meaning you can only run it with a Japanese online account.
2683794	2688556	You can only log into the Japanese eShop.
2688836	2691217	You can only select Japanese as your language in games.
2691597	2699839	So they are walling that system off as much as they can so that it is completely unattractive for somebody in the U.S.
2699919	2701180	to go over there, buy one,
2702140	2710103	and bring it back hidden in their suitcase so nobody tries to charge them for a tariff or just opening it and saying it's a used thing now and you can't tariff that.
2710643	2714044	So Nintendo is one of that.
2714324	2721207	But yeah, it's like you said for now because this is the other consequence that we didn't get into and it's only a three-hour show.
2721247	2722447	We're already 45 minutes in.
2722807	2729770	But this is the other consequence of these rising prices and things and that is that this is a challenge to piracy and hackers.
2730270	2733912	This is a challenge to piracy and hackers to pirate Mario Kart.
2758467	2760929	And again, I think piracy is a bad idea.
2761109	2762490	I do not advocate for it.
2762871	2763991	I accept the reality.
2764012	2766714	It is a consequence of what is going to happen in this situation.
2767274	2776161	And I do understand we had some chat with it in our VOG Network Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord, and 13xforever, who always has some insightful chat.
2776482	2780825	I appreciate their ability to push back on some things that I put out there sometimes.
2781446	2784248	I wouldn't do this show live if I didn't enjoy getting...
2785048	2788710	and the diverse opinions and things that even correct course me when I need to be corrected.
2788770	2789150	It's fine.
2789790	2799135	I kind of pushed back and said that there are a lot of security measures, not just on the OLED switch, but expected to be on the switch to to make that harder.
2801336	2810720	And but I also say I kind of push back on that and say every time, every time a company has said it's not possible, what happens?
2812348	2818874	I do think it's a matter of time before that firmware, and that's the thing that I think is going to be the goal.
2819475	2826762	Get that firmware on the Japanese Switch 2 out of there to accept the multi-language firmware.
2827522	2830105	There'll probably be something hardwired on the console itself.
2831446	2834829	There will be people taking soldering irons to the situation to try to figure it out.
2836711	2849603	I don't live in that world, so sure, maybe I'm just making it sound like a let's turn up the graphics on level 3 type of situation, but I fully expect the hacking and cracking community to be trying to open those Japanese Switch 2s.
2850184	2852046	It's just a question of how successful can they be.
2852226	2852546	I don't know.
2852886	2853167	We'll see.
2853607	2860816	Well, and on top of that, you also have another motivation to do that as well as the loss of a lot of these physical game cards.
2861316	2872409	So now a new thing that we're seeing with the Switch 2 editions releases are, aside from the Switch 1 cartridges with the one-use upgrade vouchers,
2872970	2877654	for the Switch 2 edition, which that sucks right there.
2877894	2885560	So once again, if you buy a Switch 2 edition of a game, you can't resell that necessarily because it will just be the Switch 1 game.
2886001	2897350	Then they also have game key cards, which are essentially, it's a plastic cartridge that you have that you buy and then you plug it into your system and then it downloads the game.
2897890	2912180	so there's no game on that cart which means that when the Nintendo online service for the Switch 2 eventually shuts down that thing is fucked unless it's on your hard drive already um
2913240	2920788	So that sucks as well, but I guess it's better than just typing in numbers or something like that into the eShop.
2920828	2926915	But I still don't like the idea of digital games masquerading as physical games.
2927075	2928297	I don't think this is...
2928977	2939081	as terrible as people are making it out to be, but I will accept the pushback on the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop is always going to have an expiration date and there will come a time when these no longer work.
2940461	2945183	However, that being said, I would argue these games already exist in Microsoft and Sony's world.
2945223	2948624	And I would argue Call of Duty and Modern Warfare are some of those games.
2948724	2951465	Some of the biggest sellers are essentially doing this exact same thing.
2951745	2955146	Hello, 90 gigabyte day one patches.
2955186	2956707	What the fuck do you think you're downloading?
2957427	2965874	If you were to put in a No Man's Sky PlayStation 4 disc into your PlayStation today, you're going to be downloading the entire fucking game.
2965914	2968356	Now, before y'all push back, I understand.
2968536	2973740	I could still play a version of No Man's Sky off of the disc and so forth.
2973800	2979505	But as more and more games are getting online, I still say Call of Duty and all that stuff.
2979665	2981106	It's the exact same thing.
2981707	2982808	Y'all are kidding yourselves.
2983388	3002474	I mean, that's... And at least I think this is certainly better than the code card that comes... This is the way, because at least I can give this cartridge to DarkSakura, and then DarkSakura can put it in their Switch too, assuming she ever gets one, and could actually download the same game and play it with all those same rights.
3002515	3008817	So we could still do a physical trade even if it's not really the game data on there.
3009277	3011598	So it's a step below having the game on the cart.
3011658	3012418	I'm not... But...
3013258	3017679	I still argue this is kind of already happening in the game industry.
3018199	3019819	Y'all are just turning a blind eye to it.
3022100	3025620	Right, but there's already limited space on the Switch 2 anyways.
3025660	3031162	I know 256 gigabytes sounds like a lot, but it's not, especially when these games are going to be larger in size.
3031282	3033282	So I don't know.
3033342	3035342	I just don't like the idea of that stuff.
3037763	3038543	Yeah, I'll accept that.
3043053	3063376	uh what else so yeah lots of game announcements uh Mario Kart World obviously the big one um some features that are coming to the Switch that are brand new for the Switch I guess or Switch 2 game chat so it looks like Discord except it has a shitty uh video camera that you could use as well with really low frame rate
3064351	3066473	graphics on the video calls.
3067194	3072218	The Piranha Plant one that the Hori company is making is super fucking cute.
3072538	3077882	And it would indicate that any camera ought to work, question mark.
3077982	3081025	Again, Nintendo hasn't quite filled in the gaps there.
3081085	3085628	I guess I will check my Nintendo Today app throughout the week to see if they comment on it.
3085728	3092494	But I'm anticipating third-party USB-C cameras will work fine.
3093531	3105334	They're going to have a game share like they had with the DS where you can be able to stream the game essentially to other DSs or other, in this case, Switch 2 consoles or Switch consoles.
3105874	3110475	And then you can play without actually having the game in certain multiplayer games.
3110635	3111555	So that was kind of cool.
3112996	3114616	Now, here's the thing.
3114936	3117497	I can't believe this didn't come up because I was thinking about it with that $80 price tag.
3119955	3122137	And again, it's a little bit unclear.
3122197	3124099	This isn't going to work on every game, right?
3124179	3125780	It works on some games.
3126260	3130184	So is Mario Kart World to be confirmed to be one of those games?
3130704	3133266	Because in my mind, if it's confirmed, if, if, if...
3137412	3155182	it helps to justify that $80 price tag a little bit and that's something Nintendo could have come out to help build the case for why they believe $80 is a susceptible price for the game but you only need one copy of this game to share and race with your friends would have been a huge thing to sell with um
3155822	3156223	Mm-hmm.
3171821	3172181	I don't know.
3192436	3205154	at this time so this is a value add for Nintendo is being able to beam the game and share with friends and it's something that we should say yes that is a great thing that adds great value to a console that we're all screaming is not worth the value
3207224	3207564	What else?
3207985	3209485	They have a new Pro Controller coming.
3210546	3216749	They've, of course, confirmed that your Joy-Con 2s are going to be magnetic.
3217049	3222952	That's because they have a magnet inside the system and the L2R2 buttons, I think those are called.
3224232	3229234	are metal, so that's how it adheres to the system itself.
3230775	3237917	Along with that, they talked about compatible Switch games that you basically can port over your library, which is nice.
3238798	3246901	They showed off Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild and the upgrades for that, including what was it?
3246921	3247421	The
3250155	3255731	Mobile phone app that allows you to use it like a camera, like a, what was it, smart glass?
3257245	3258646	This is Nintendo Smart Glass now.
3258726	3259587	This is so interesting.
3259887	3263390	Nintendo is adopting all these Microsoft things years after the fact.
3264110	3265671	The Smart Glass, there's one.
3266672	3267833	The other would be the Kinect.
3268554	3272777	Because those games in Mario Party Jamboree looked like the cheap Kinect games.
3272837	3273197	I'm sorry.
3273677	3274858	The iToy.
3274998	3276159	Yeah, the iToy.
3276259	3279202	The Jamboree was the weakest part of that whole Direct.
3279722	3282244	I think that was not a value add.
3282664	3283365	But I think...
3284245	3286488	I feel like Nintendo is going to get away with it.
3286548	3288390	And that people are going to eat that up a little bit.
3288490	3289891	I don't know what that price though.
3290232	3291673	$80 for Jamboree.
3291773	3296078	If you didn't have the Switch 1 version, $80 for Jamboree is going to be a tough pill to swallow.
3296138	3297179	But I don't know.
3297800	3300062	I was not enthused by what I saw with Jamboree.
3300082	3301063	Yeah, I'm...
3301544	3304187	It's very skeptical that that would work well.
3304447	3310814	I mean, I know tech has gotten a lot better since PlayStation 2 days, but... Jeez, that camera does not look great.
3310934	3313938	Like, it does not look like a high-quality camera, and I just...
3315522	3322684	Camera gameplay just hasn't worked, and I can't imagine that Nintendo's like, yeah, we got this.
3322944	3323865	Maybe they do, I don't know.
3323945	3331647	I think the Discord integration on the TV, which is something I think would be neat to see PlayStation and Xbox adopt.
3331687	3343991	Yes, I know Discord is integrated into PlayStation, but you can't do the cameras and live and all that and picture and picture and that whole thing, which I feel like we were getting closer to on the PlayStation 4 with the Twitch streaming built-in thing that we had there, but...
3344551	3348013	I don't want to get too far away, but I think there's a lot of interesting things there.
3349134	3354458	I think being able to bridge living rooms with different families competing against each other in games.
3354918	3357420	I think for some people that's going to be a lot of fun.
3357560	3358961	I don't think I'm one of those people.
3359942	3360342	I think I...
3361663	3376273	I think I'm one of those people that, let's be real, it's gonna, it's gonna, not me personally, but I just, I'm gonna hear about this and it's gonna make me laugh, that all the gay guys are gonna get together and play Mario Kart and are gonna be wearing just their underwear on these calls and that, that's just funny because it's Nintendo.
3376694	3384899	Like, that's, you know, but luckily we have parental controls features now that I'm not as worried about this stuff going the way of PictoChat, but like...
3385820	3387282	Hacker's Gonna Hack Hacker's Gonna Hack
3402819	3404380	All right.
3404720	3405680	Other fun announcements.
3405700	3408841	So Kirby and the Forgotten Land is getting a Switch 2 edition as well.
3408921	3412202	So it's going to add Starcross Worlds, which is like an expansion to it.
3412702	3418584	Metroid Prime 4 Beyond is also going to have a Switch 2 edition as well.
3419664	3424026	Also confirmed that the Joy-Con 2s can be used like a mouse.
3424526	3427007	So it will have mouse controls as well.
3427227	3429188	So that's kind of exciting.
3429628	3432009	That is the best feature of the Switch 2.
3433049	3437371	And way too many people are sleeping on this and under-reporting this.
3437871	3445754	I cannot tell you how excited I am to play Metroid Prime 4 with this new innovative control scheme.
3445774	3449516	Because literally what it is, it is the best part of playing with a controller.
3449976	3452077	And it is the best part of playing with keyboard and mouse.
3452697	3453237	Put together.
3453858	3459461	You take keyboard and mouse and you replace WASD with an actual control analog.
3459801	3461082	That is going to be amazing.
3461482	3467045	If the mouse actually runs as well as a PC mouse does...
3468691	3476996	I would assume because these mice only cost like $10 at this point that that technology is going to be present in these and it will run pretty well.
3477756	3480618	So I'm withholding my final judgment until I actually get to get in there and play the game.
3480918	3486661	But I think about how fucking great that's going to work on Metroid Prime 2 and how great that's going to work on...
3488582	3490925	E3VL says ergonomics is an issue Sure, you gotta be careful
3504199	3504699	and DarkSakura.com
3527413	3528594	That should be possible.
3529054	3534455	Why can't I just replace the Joy-Con controller with a real mouse that sends the same Bluetooth signal?
3535415	3537595	That would be the tits.
3537855	3538716	That would be amazing.
3541016	3541476	Yeah, maybe.
3541596	3543276	Until we know, we don't.
3544677	3548477	Yeah, Pokemon Legends ZA also getting a Switch 2 edition.
3548538	3550018	I mean, that's no-brainer.
3550058	3550678	Thank God.
3552688	3580273	Drag, DragXDrive Bobby says a lot of the games that use the mouse also use the gyro so it's not a one-to-one to a real mouse I still wonder if for some of these port games, okay so maybe less your Mario, or maybe less your Metroid Prime 4, but your Overwatch ports let's say, I still wonder if that isn't something that couldn't be possible just like you can plug a keyboard in the Playstation 5 most games don't support it but there's a couple that do
3581849	3608964	Yeah, Microsoft does that a lot too I would just be curious if it's possible, that's all Because I think, again, it could be a game changer Anyway DragX Drive, which was that wheelchair basketball game Using the double mouse controls Oh yeah, that was fucking cool That was a really cool concept And I think that's going to make a lot of people feel seen And that's really cool DarkSakura, did you see that game?
3608984	3609064	Yeah
3610964	3611665	Which one?
3612145	3618351	So you take both Joy-Cons in their mouse mode, and it's a wheelchair basketball game.
3618671	3621994	And you move them like this, like you're moving a wheelchair around.
3622595	3623595	No, I didn't see it.
3623776	3624696	Oh, you should.
3624756	3625497	It was a neat trailer.
3625737	3630001	I don't play a lot of sports games, but it was like...
3631022	3641453	It wasn't just the fact that it was wheelchair basketball, which we haven't really seen in gaming, but it had a Rocket League kind of vibe to it that made it really cool to me.
3643014	3643235	Anyway.
3644383	3652287	Yeah, of course, next big announcement, third-party game, Elden Ring coming to the Switch 2, so Elden Ring Tarnished Edition.
3653227	3656308	Also got confirmation that Hades 2 is coming to the Switch 2.
3657929	3666313	Lots of third-party games, Street Fighter 6, getting a Years 1-2 Fighters Edition, which is including 26 characters.
3667713	3672175	Daemon X Machina, Titanic Scion is coming to the Switch 2.
3673496	3691590	as well as Split Fiction 2 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 I want to say also Hitman World of Satiation Project 007 Borderlands 4 Bravely Default getting a remaster Yakuza I'm into that actually
3693027	3712450	New Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment That was actually really cool I'm glad Hyrule Warriors is coming back again I'm excited to play that All the third party support, cool It needed that We knew there was going to be a lot of catch up games that come out Cool, I'm glad Switch 2 is being supported It needs it, cool
3713251	3731488	and then they announced that because of the more powerful hardware that it will be able to offer Nintendo GameCube emulation as part of Nintendo Classics through Nintendo Online Expansion Pass which includes the starter games Wind Waker, Soul Calibur 2 and F-Zero GX.
3732088	3734249	There's also a GameCube controller.
3734389	3740171	There's a part of me that's like only three games, but then I'm also like they picked a killer lineup of three.
3740191	3745473	Like if you could only pick three GameCube games to launch your service with, they picked a really soft three.
3745553	3747754	Like obviously I am super psyched about F-Zero.
3748234	3750155	And I heard this on Bobby's show.
3750575	3755757	Apparently he was watching the Treehouse streams and they confirmed that the widescreen modes will work.
3756297	3757378	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3780188	3780628	How about that?
3780748	3783769	Oh, Chad is saying Super Mario Strikers is confirmed for the lineup, too.
3784130	3785950	So that must have been a Treehouse announcement or something.
3786110	3790932	They had a bunch of other game titles that they showed, like, after they showed those three games off.
3791253	3794354	Like, I remember there was, of course, Mario Sunshine.
3794394	3795254	The drip feed.
3795834	3798455	Please look forward to the drip feeding for the next two years.
3798535	3798736	Yes.
3799136	3801577	Yeah, Pokemon Stadium, all that stuff.
3801817	3803618	So, yeah, it looks pretty cool.
3805614	3813699	Don't forget, this is very important when it comes to that.
3813959	3816720	We're saying, yay, F-Zero, yay, Soul Calibur.
3817181	3824705	I want you to remember, some time ago, Nintendo allowed their emulators to be played across the internet.
3825632	3826332	F-Zero F-Zero F-Zero
3846334	3850218	Now, I don't know if the GameCube client will let you do four people online.
3850319	3854003	I don't know if Nintendo Treehouse confirmed that or not.
3854543	3857527	But think about that for a minute.
3857867	3861571	That we're going to be able to play four player across... Okay, Treehouse showed it.
3861832	3864214	We're going to be able to play four player across the internet in F-Zero.
3864975	3884729	so that's that's something yeah so yes we're getting excited about 20 year old games but we're going to be able to play them in a way we weren't able to play them 20 years ago that's that's huge that's that's a twitch stream that's a VOG Network twitch stream now Bobby Blackwolf and the cast of OLR beat each other up in F-Zero GX could be a thing
3887416	3887737	what else?
3888237	3915532	Deltarune chapters 1-4 also Civ 7 of course using the mouse support that they have with the Joy-Con 2 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition coming as well Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate and a bunch of other games that they showed off as well one of the ones I was very excited about was
3916328	3922454	Let's see, so Enter the Gungeon 2 looked amazing, so that's going to be cool.
3922554	3936188	And then they also get a brand new exclusive FromSoftware game called The Duskbloods, which looks like a Vampire Souls-like game, and that's launching next year as well.
3937569	3961657	Kirby Air Riders brand new Kirby game coming as well as a follow up to Kirby Air Ride and then of course the last game that they finished it off with looks like a Mario Odyssey game but Donkey Kong Bonanza and it's kind of like the Donkey Kong Odyssey but not but along those lines and that is coming out July 17th for only $70
3964518	3979677	chat feels you buried the lead on Kirby Air Riders look, look, we're an hour plus into the show we have to cut a few corners we'll address those games in greater detail when we get our hands on them at some point
3980518	3982039	But that leads me to this question.
3982059	3984602	Do you have more, Loki, at some point?
3985562	3986383	Yeah, real quick.
3986563	3987104	Pre-orders.
3989226	3993669	So originally with pre-orders, obviously you can pre-order through retailers and stuff.
3993990	3996432	Nintendo also is taking pre-orders.
3996892	3998654	However, there are some caveats there.
3998814	4006721	So they are allowing you to place a pre-order or interest in a pre-order if you have a Nintendo Online membership.
4007321	4022942	You must have had paid for a minimum of 12 months for that membership and have at least shared your gameplay stats as well as 50 hours of total gameplay.
4024263	4027505	on that account, basically to try to combat scalpers.
4028165	4030246	Which they have to do.
4030446	4034487	I don't know about the restricting it to the paid online only.
4034547	4040490	I think that's a little crappy, but it's all right.
4040630	4041790	I understand why they have to do it.
4041830	4045192	They have to draw the line somewhere and they want to make sure the real gamers get it.
4045332	4046652	So I can't.
4048153	4049353	It's not a hill I want to die on.
4049574	4050274	It is what it is.
4051553	4059918	By the way, Mike Deft in chat says, at least mention Sakurai is returning to work on a Kirby game since for like two decades.
4060118	4062919	Yes, and never ask him for anything ever again.
4065140	4065541	Did you see?
4065741	4066121	Did you see?
4066141	4075186	Of course, the YouTubers are already going crazy on like some fucking leak on Super Smash Brothers, which, you know, I'm not.
4076206	4077527	People are going crazy.
4077727	4078248	Yeah, I know.
4078388	4078648	I know.
4080011	4083694	But I think it's reasonable to expect, like it feels like one of those things is just safe.
4084375	4092262	Betting that a Super Smash Brothers will come out on the Switch too, I just feel like it's one of those things where it's like, that's just a safe thing to try to make yourself look like a genius.
4092363	4093003	I called it!
4094985	4095205	Yeah.
4095265	4096166	Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
4096807	4098508	There's gonna be a Mario game.
4098528	4099649	There'll probably be a Splatoon 4.
4100610	4101291	No shit, Sherlock.
4102412	4103153	Anyway, sorry.
4103193	4103373	Sorry.
4106294	4133967	no I think that's about it for Switch 2 stuff I mean honestly it's been a lot we still have a lot to find out like with what's going on with pre-orders if they're going to open those back up I mean at the end of the day and I hate to say that I'm part of the problem I still probably will order one but with that caveat though like the only difference the only difference though with that is with the Switch right now like I've been picking up a lot of the first party games as they come out like pretty much as they come out
4134387	4138969	I don't know if that would be the case with the Switch 2 because of the additional cost for everything.
4140690	4143911	But I mean, it's obviously something we're going to play.
4144311	4146092	I mean, we're going to get our money's worth out of it.
4146232	4153255	It's just, yeah, I don't... I still don't like the idea of it basically giving the okay to...
4154758	4155799	The rest of the game industry.
4155919	4162562	It would be a different situation if the other game companies in the gaming industry had the same quality as Nintendo.
4163002	4164963	We would be having a whole different conversation here.
4165003	4167544	But unfortunately, that's just not the landscape that we live in.
4168384	4177049	And the way that these other companies treat their consumers and treat their employees, I don't feel that they are worth $80 a game.
4177189	4183452	They have not shown us that they are responsible enough to release games in a finished state that is...
4185613	4188757	is worth $80 at the outset.
4189257	4196745	And they have not shown us that we can trust them to even just follow through with their promises in these games in the first place.
4197405	4203812	So I just honestly think that it's a huge mistake to just give them that pass.
4206832	4209954	Jamie, where's your head at with Switch 2 and all this?
4210994	4217697	I remember last week, I felt like you were a little tepid because you were kind of like, we don't really play our Switch a lot a lot.
4217757	4220578	So I'm curious where your head's at on Switch 2 right now.
4221758	4224279	I'm still about the same as I was last week.
4224539	4228040	I mean, I want to wait and see how things play out.
4229621	4229761	Yeah.
4231159	4257911	I mean, I watched some reviews one of my favorite tech reviewers, Mr. Who's the Boss did a video, I actually posted it on my Blue Sky a couple days ago comparing the OLED switch to the LCD on the Switch 2 in that it was brighter and more vibrant talking about how it felt in the hand, about the
4258471	4265016	Way that the Joy-Con snap on and almost lock in place how firm they are.
4266857	4271261	I think in construction, it definitely sounds like it's a far better product.
4272702	4276084	And I'm interested in that respect.
4276124	4279187	I mean, I would love to have like a new Animal Crossing.
4279227	4281528	I mean, certainly a new Animal Crossing would sell a system for me.
4282869	4293014	but right now there's not enough going on on it that I would want to rush right out and get one it's not wait in line worthy for me at this point
4293936	4304841	I think that's that's fair, especially because, you know, when we saw the titles coming out for it, we really only saw stuff, you know, at least first party for just a few months out.
4304881	4309703	There was no there was no holiday announcement from Nintendo, which I found a little bit like Pokemon.
4309883	4312084	We still don't know Pokemon and all that stuff's coming out.
4312124	4314165	Well, but I don't care about Pokemon.
4315026	4325482	I don't care about Mario Kart because I don't really find it fun I certainly don't care about Donkey Kong games because I haven't thought any of them were particularly fun um
4326445	4328186	Kirby's great, you know?
4328606	4329346	I like Kirby.
4329546	4331227	I haven't bought the last couple ones.
4333268	4347094	There's just nothing really that super interests me about it other than that it seems like it would be a much brighter and sturdier and certainly larger screen to play my old shit on.
4348168	4355873	Well, I guess my point in bringing that up was that I still feel like, you know, with E3 not being a thing anymore, we still have the Summer Game Fest.
4355913	4362176	And now I guess whatever the ESA is, apparently, you know, the other time that we've kind of gone, wow, that might be an interesting thing they're doing.
4362997	4371742	Of course, I already forgot the name of the show, but the not E3 thing that they're going to be doing in the summer at some point, that's E3 without the show floor, basically.
4371762	4372483	Yeah.
4373203	4399487	that uh maybe Nintendo will announce another flagship title that could be oh Iacon is coming in 2026 my bad I thought it was this year okay oh I know it's not gonna have dead by daylight but uh it could you know maybe they're having problems with I was I was gonna say maybe that Animal Crossing or that game you really want is holiday maybe yeah but I know they're not gonna have a dead by daylight on it because of some programming issues interesting
4400862	4403363	Yeah, that's at least what I've been hearing so far.
4403523	4407966	I mean, it could happen, but I play on my Mac anyway, so what's the point?
4410167	4415090	It's just... This really... You know me.
4415430	4418592	At this point, I own how many systems?
4420212	4425075	And I don't need to have any more right now?
4425835	4428517	I mean, you know I didn't buy my Switch, right?
4429588	4432113	Yeah, you won it in a work raffle or something, right?
4432133	4433055	I won my Switch.
4433415	4436120	We didn't really have any much of an intention of buying one at the time.
4436541	4440268	And I'm kind of in the same boat, so maybe I'll win another one.
4440308	4440689	Who knows?
4440729	4441450	And then I'll have one.
4441470	4442011	Yay.
4443317	4445518	Um, for me, I'm just not excited.
4445798	4448179	I'm, I'm actually kind of there with Loki.
4448339	4451720	Like I, maybe I'm part of the problem, but yeah, I want to pre-order one.
4452121	4457883	If, if the tariff thing is resolved, which again, and also we have to see what the price is too.
4457923	4460824	Cause after tariffs, if it's like $600, that's right.
4462465	4467286	I'm, I, I'm not paying who is in line for, were any of us in line for PS fives?
4468287	4470968	No, but I did get a series X on launch day.
4472418	4500634	and I probably would have gotten a PS5 on launch day if I could have but I ended up waiting two years for a PS5 and it worked out okay you know and that might end up being the case with Switch 2 especially since we know that the Switch 1 still has a lot of games coming out for it but I just I yeah I'm into the technology especially when I think about 4 player F-Zero and GameCube when I think about how much better Pokemon Legends ZA is going to run on it how much I want to play Metroid Prime 4 with those controls but
4501474	4502314	to that extent.
4503475	4505516	But I will not pay more than $450 or $500.
4505596	4513980	I'll say $500 because obviously I'm going to get that bundle with Mario Kart that makes the price a lot more digestible.
4514901	4516862	But I will not pay more than $500 for it.
4517202	4519803	So if tariffs fuck the whole situation, I will just wait.
4520324	4520664	I'll wait.
4521684	4524306	And I'm definitely not going to the used market for it.
4524386	4525046	Fuck all of them.
4525646	4527147	So I'm definitely not doing that.
4527287	4530389	What might sell one for us would be maybe a Smash.
4531325	4532286	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4545640	4568035	but where I will also agree with Loki that I will give and this is across the board this is not just Nintendo I'm going to give a lot more consideration to where I'm dropping my money for games I'm not going to buy games on a fucking whim I'm going to buy games when I know I have the time to sit down and play them and that I want to dedicate the time to put it put into them
4570056	4571858	That's going to be my thing moving forward.
4571878	4574059	I'm not going to spend $80 on a game.
4574380	4584288	Hell, for that Donkey Kong game, as neat as that whole thing looks and stuff, I'm not pre-ordering that and I'm not paying $70 the day it comes out until I hear it is so good.
4584688	4589773	I'm missing something and I have the time in my life to sit down and play that game.
4590908	4602135	and even then I will probably still leverage bargaining like Costco, Nintendo gift cards assuming that's still a thing or whatever I can leverage to try to make that price a little more digestible.
4603676	4605837	Here's my other thing.
4605957	4610180	I would probably get a Steam Deck before I get a Switch 2.
4611547	4611927	That's fair.
4612247	4613268	I love my Steam Deck.
4613308	4613948	My Steam Deck's great.
4613988	4614968	I have the library.
4615128	4615328	Yeah.
4615669	4619990	I mean, honestly, though, I don't really bring portable systems with me anymore.
4620250	4622811	I just usually have my iPad if I travel.
4626593	4630374	My Switch 2 will always be docked because that's how I am with my Switch 1.
4630434	4634115	The only time I take my Switch 1 out of the dock is when I'm going on an airplane.
4635276	4635596	That's it.
4636605	4639567	I don't take my Switch with me when I travel.
4639867	4643870	I just bring my iPad and typically I read books.
4644250	4650394	I'm usually going to a gaming con or a con with gamers where I feel I'll be able to get use out of it.
4650514	4650914	That's why.
4652015	4654056	I still read books.
4655777	4659660	I haven't brought one to TwitchCon anytime I've been to TwitchCon.
4660160	4663042	I might bring the Game Boy Micro just for lols.
4666272	4671397	Oh, Def says you could use the Steam Deck to stream games via a capture card.
4671677	4672958	That's a clever use for it.
4674760	4683248	So yeah, I'm oddly landing in the same boat as Loki, where it's like, yeah, I'll pre-order one, but I'm going to give a lot more thought to how I'm spending my money on games.
4684029	4685450	A lot more thought to that.
4686371	4689594	And Nintendo's habit of never putting games on sale...
4691491	4694612	I don't know if that's going to fly anymore in the year 2025, but we'll see.
4695292	4695612	We'll see.
4696233	4697253	I'm not ordering shit.
4697893	4699334	Oh yeah, fuck pre-orders.
4703275	4705316	I'm not putting my name down for anything.
4706096	4707736	I'm not putting my money down for anything.
4707796	4709477	Except for the system itself.
4709517	4710617	No, not even for the system.
4710857	4712338	No, for me, I will.
4712538	4714018	I'm not.
4714078	4715939	I have zero need to do that.
4716079	4718300	You are welcome to your opinion, but I will get one to get the system.
4718340	4718760	Here's the point.
4719713	4748819	here's the point the reason why is because I want to send the message that there's not interest because of the price points they're setting for everything if you're like oh I don't like this price point for this or I'm not going to support that and you're still putting your name down for one that's still sending them the message that what they're doing is okay I sort of always expected this thing to be $500 and that's where I'm at
4750464	4754586	But I won't pay more than that because of stupid-ass tariffs and rules and things like that.
4756507	4756807	All right.
4758588	4760750	We talked a lot about the Switch, but we knew we would.
4760850	4763951	We knew it was that kind of night, and this is the thing that everybody's talking about tonight.
4764352	4765992	We welcome your feedback as well.
4766893	4773396	We welcome your thoughts, whether it's as simple as what DeboPop12 says in chat, Nintendo Switch 2 for the win, or...
4774437	4777118	Bob Coffey, who says the console price for the Switch 2 is reasonable.
4777178	4779280	It's the game prices that are WTF.
4780180	4782561	Or Def saying the price of the console ain't the problem.
4783202	4788965	Bobby Blackwell says the game key cards are just the digital key, like a UB key or other hardware authentication device.
4789325	4792266	We will get your comments, not just through chat, but also email.
4792306	4794888	This is a great topic to send us if you have more in-depth thoughts.
4795268	4798830	Participate at OrangeLodgeRadio.com if you want to send us an email with your in-depth thoughts.
4799590	4802792	And then, of course, we also welcome the bleats over on BlueSky.com.
4803312	4805693	Our username on BlueSky is domain-based.
4805753	4809976	It's OrangeLoungeRadio.com on BlueSky if you want to send us some bleats over there.
4810636	4814598	For the meantime, believe it or not, we have other gaming things to talk about.
4814878	4817840	And we're going to start, as usual, by talking about our gaming weeks.
4818220	4819380	So DarkSakura, let's start with you.
4819441	4820161	How was your gaming week?
4822323	4824804	I played the usual stuff.
4824924	4833568	Actually, I started Mass Effect last night for my semi-retro night now because I really wanted to play Mass Effect.
4833708	4846654	I just had the overwhelming sense of nostalgia and thanks to my chat, my shepherd is named Meg because of me being a dirty Megmane.
4848335	4850076	At least you didn't have to name her Pigu.
4851593	4853035	Well, I would have named her Amanda.
4854376	4854596	Fair.
4856038	4857059	Yeah.
4857279	4861723	And then, you know, me talking shit about the characters the whole time because I'm allowed to.
4863786	4866588	And of course I played... I didn't play any Monster Hunter.
4867269	4868090	I need a break from it.
4868230	4869551	It's a little bit too much for my head.
4870653	4872815	But I played some Dead by Daylight and we had...
4873755	4876336	5 ghoul games in a row and I'm just like, you know what?
4876676	4877156	I'm done.
4877377	4877977	I don't want to play.
4878457	4887580	Although I did play Rize for my games and it's definitely different after me playing almost exclusively Pig for a while.
4889221	4890201	It was different.
4892082	4893662	Also, still playing Fruit Mountain.
4893882	4897183	I'm still playing my stupid little Mahjong game.
4899844	4900464	Bellatro.
4900705	4901785	I've been playing Bellatro.
4903115	4904096	When I'm not doing anything.
4905677	4909098	It's just sort of like my stupid clicky game at this point.
4909279	4910459	I'm not really addicted to it.
4910499	4913301	It's the same reason I play Mahjong.
4916243	4917884	I played some Palia.
4918264	4920765	Actually, I've got my second property in Palia now.
4921866	4923327	And I've made it just for touring.
4923387	4927109	It's sort of like this magical witch in the woods theme.
4928479	4934222	and then I think my second theme I'm going to do is all when I do my next property is going to be like all railroads.
4935283	4937604	So we'll see.
4939525	4943487	I was playing something else and my brain kind of farted on what it was.
4943627	4945127	So yeah, that was it.
4945147	4946248	Spun back to Mass Effect.
4946968	4950810	And I was like, Garrus, I want to date you now.
4952471	4952811	All right.
4952851	4955092	He showed up and my response was soon.
4957013	4957934	Loki, your gaming week.
4959381	4961522	Uh, let's see, uh, it was Minecraft.
4962003	4967806	I played lots of Minecraft and then I put out another episode five weeks in a row now, so that's great.
4969907	4973309	And yeah, and I also went and saw the Minecraft movie twice.
4973329	4974509	Yeah, let's talk about that.
4975069	4979652	Tell us, tell us how you felt about the Minecraft movie as somebody who consumes a lot of Minecraft.
4981412	4982272	I really liked it.
4982973	4986796	It's not... I don't even think you necessarily have to consume a lot of Minecraft.
4986856	4995043	A lot of people were like easy to judge or like early to judge it based off of like, oh, well, I don't play Minecraft, so I don't understand any of this and stuff.
4995063	5001008	But like, honestly, it's more... Apparently, there's plenty not in that boat because it did bang in business this weekend.
5001048	5006173	I'm not sure if you saw, but it made more money than the Mario Brothers movie did, which, you know, could be inflation.
5006313	5007594	But it did well.
5007674	5007854	That's...
5009563	5010784	The Minecraft movie has done very well.
5010824	5013406	It did better than Captain America.
5017649	5018790	It's the biggest weekend this year.
5019831	5026236	As I say, it's got a lot of absurd humor like Jared Hess's other movies, like Napoleon Dynamite especially.
5026736	5037265	Even before we even get into the Minecraft world, there's just a lot of absurd characters that they kind of introduce and you know, just like
5038767	5052491	One of the funny bits in the beginning, so two of the kids are moving into this brand new town after their mom passed away or something like that, and so he goes to a brand new school, and the vice principal's like, yeah, I like to overshare.
5052551	5058873	It just completely starts talking about her divorce and all this stuff, just all this stuff overshared.
5058893	5062034	Then you see the next scene, he goes to his class, and his teacher's like,
5062574	5087066	just oversharing again like I you know I claimed four thousand dollars on my tax returns you know just like ridiculous stuff like the whole thing was full of ridiculous characters and a bunch of ridiculous scenes in there as well I thought it was it was funny it would like a weird dry sense of humor I guess I like that kind of stuff um certainly like if you're going into it expecting like
5088618	5095551	Minecraft Story Mode or something like that, where it's a story in Minecraft, you know, around Minecraft mechanics and stuff like that.
5096232	5097434	Minecraft has a plot?
5097454	5097795	Yeah.
5098544	5103946	Like, it's, it's, it's not, like, but it's, it was funny.
5104026	5104587	Like, I don't know.
5105127	5108788	I enjoyed it enough to go see it twice, and I thought it was really funny both times.
5109329	5111770	And everybody in the theater had a good time, too.
5112150	5119173	And a lot of, like, I know that some of the complaints I've seen, too, is like, well, they're just shouting out, you know, the lines that they saw in the trailer and stuff like that.
5120126	5123708	Yeah, like some people do will go in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and stuff like that.
5123828	5124848	Okay, hold up.
5125068	5125508	Hold up.
5126149	5130691	Rocky Horror Picture Show is a unique experience that people expect to see.
5131171	5132872	Like, I don't know.
5134012	5135873	The talking back to the movie, I don't know.
5136553	5141595	It's multiple ways because I don't think I'm interested in seeing the Minecraft movie with kids yelling back at it.
5141895	5143016	But that doesn't mean I won't see it.
5143136	5147798	And I'm actually pleased to hear it's doing well because that means it'll stay in theaters for a month.
5148018	5148598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5172037	5178380	I saw it at the Dollar Theater with a full because it was the very first weekend that it showed up at the Dollar Theater.
5178400	5184904	It was a very full house with a very diverse crowd that loved to talk through the movie.
5185604	5188546	And I will say I had a really fucking good time.
5189696	5190897	Like, I fucking loved it.
5191297	5200142	Like, you haven't lived until you've seen The Matrix with that opening scene where she's like doing the crane kick and somebody's like yelling out, fuck yeah, get him, girl!
5200202	5201063	You know, things like that.
5201123	5202444	It's just like, I loved it.
5202564	5203644	I had a great time.
5203925	5204725	So, I don't know.
5204805	5206686	I guess I'm a little torn, but yeah.
5209676	5210677	Yeah, so, I don't know.
5210697	5212618	Yeah, I had a good time.
5213458	5215659	So, it was worth it, I think.
5216760	5218561	Yeah, I mean, it's, like, the best acting.
5218641	5224584	It's certainly not to the level of, like, a Lego movie or something like that, where, like, there's a, you know, big story.
5224644	5237270	But, like, honestly, there's a lot of it to identify with, in a sense, because one of... Not to get too spoilery, but, like, essentially, they show Steve in the beginning, and he's, like, from the real world.
5237770	5238091	And he...
5239151	5247436	He's basically this guy that's stuck in an office job and just unhappy with not being able to be creative in that office job.
5247476	5253940	Like, they're seeking creativity and, like, an outlet for that outside of... I don't know anyone that feels that way.
5253960	5259063	Well, yes, outside of the doldrum of your office corporate life existence and stuff like that.
5259183	5262425	And it's like, yes, that's completely identifiable.
5262545	5265727	Like, I completely relate with that.
5266188	5266328	And...
5267328	5295659	I think that there's a lot of that stuff like you know even with Jason Momoa's character kind of trying to you know live off the glory of your past or something like that and just trying to adapt with the fact that like you know hey you gotta move on you know that type of thing or just be better or whatever the case may be so everybody's kind of had like their own like growth in the in the story um
5296761	5302824	And it's funny, because even parts where Jack Black's character is not really likable in certain parts.
5303305	5307387	But the thing that's funny, though, is there's a lot of physical humor in it as well.
5307407	5312530	Just like people just getting completely destroyed in fights and stuff like that.
5312630	5314771	And it's funny, because it's stupid.
5314831	5319214	And just the long, drawn-out gags that they have are really...
5319943	5320483	Hilarious.
5320803	5321824	To me, I think.
5321944	5322284	I don't know.
5322344	5328286	But then again, I'm a guy that like, you know, I went and saw Kung Pao in the theaters like eight times.
5328326	5329086	Like, I don't even know.
5329146	5331266	Like, it's like, I like dumb movies.
5331286	5332527	Jennifer Coolidge is in it.
5333247	5334868	Yes, Jennifer Coolidge is in it.
5335368	5339369	And she is the vice principal who over shares everything.
5339549	5340609	And it is ridiculous.
5340809	5341730	I love her so much.
5342150	5342610	I really do.
5344352	5348462	I just want to see it so I have more impressions to put in my catalog
5354028	5354308	Anyway.
5354708	5361893	It's like... She's like hitting on the Garbage Man, which is Jason Momoa's character.
5362373	5366015	He's Garrett the Garbage Man Garrison or something like that.
5367636	5368937	This is how ridiculous his character is.
5368957	5371738	So he's like great at this arcade beat-em-up game.
5371778	5373819	It's like Final Fight or something like that.
5374660	5378022	And so he would be... It's a two-player co-op game.
5378402	5379603	He was playing both sides.
5379723	5379803	Yeah.
5380323	5408738	I also heard this involves a mention of an Atari Cosmos Yes, there's an Atari Cosmos that's he's trying to win because he owns a retro game store and they're evicting him because he needs to pay his rent and so he was bidding on storage basically like storage units and one that had an Atari Cosmos in it but obviously something happens
5410302	5415182	But like that, or like, you know, eventually when they find the, you know...
5416021	5419184	The device to get to the Minecraft world or whatever.
5419484	5424268	It comes with a warning that's super specific for Jason Momoa's character.
5424588	5427130	So whatever you do, don't put this thing inside this thing.
5427150	5428751	And then on the other side.
5429112	5439300	But if you're a struggling small business owner who's really hard on finances right now, I just want to let you know that there's tons of riches here.
5439740	5441962	Not that you should come here anyways, but...
5442642	5445543	Just letting you know that there's tons of riches here as well.
5445823	5448464	It's so oddly specific that it makes it even funnier.
5451905	5461529	I don't remember who it was I've seen when they're talking about writing comedy jokes, but essentially to make the joke like, oh no, I hit somebody with my car again.
5462489	5485200	could be funny but saying like oh no I hit somebody with my Jeep Grand Cherokee again that's funnier um and that's kind of that premise that they took with this movie as well they get very oddly specific with some of the gags and it's just up my alley to be honest it it's it's it's silly it it's silly and I love it and it's ridiculous and you just have to kind of
5486747	5487668	It's not realistic.
5488208	5492633	It's just a silly movie that's like a Napoleon Dynamite or Nacho Libre.
5493033	5493353	I don't know.
5494735	5496276	I'm open to seeing it at some point.
5496797	5498378	So it's just I never get to the movies.
5498618	5500060	I was supposed to see that Looney Tunes movie.
5500100	5500500	Never did.
5500640	5501941	Just, you know, things happen.
5503183	5507387	Yes, the Tiger Claw mentioned there's one joke in the movie involving Jason Momoa and Jack Black.
5508683	5512124	Yes, all I'm going to say is full man sandwich.
5513344	5513984	It's great.
5515185	5520886	It's the absolute just like most ridiculous thing and it's great.
5521926	5522667	Full man sandwich.
5523067	5523407	Alright.
5524787	5529808	Okay, so it sounds like a good review for the Minecraft movie from Loki, so great.
5529928	5532489	Anything else for your gaming week you want to share, Loki?
5534569	5536350	I know a little bit of Blotro, but that's about it.
5537661	5540463	My gaming week was very retro of sorts.
5541304	5553631	I was gaming at a friend's house and we were playing old games like I played the original Mario Kart, we played Mario Kart 8, we played Luminous, we played some fighting games like Mortal Kombat Armageddon, of all things, like very random.
5553932	5555473	That game is so clunky now to me.
5555833	5557274	It did not age well, I will see that.
5558594	5559795	So yeah, I was doing some retro stuff.
5559815	5560835	And then I was playing retro.
5561395	5562535	I was playing Castlevania.
5563435	5563775	So I don't know.
5563795	5565656	I've been in a weird retro mood lately.
5565736	5567696	I haven't been playing a lot of the newer stuff.
5567796	5572958	I've not been moving on Diablo 4, but granted, there's not a new season until the end of the month.
5573298	5576078	And oddly, very quiet for me on Final Fantasy XIV as well.
5576098	5580899	But I had a lot of stuff going on after work this week, so I just didn't really have a lot of time to sit down and play it.
5580959	5586181	So maybe I'll get around to that next week, because I still have a new dungeon I want to play in that game.
5587461	5603094	yeah just been a lot of other things going on still still playing Pikmin, Ingress, Pokemon Go still playing all that do you know how many fucking Burmese I've caught in Pokemon Go this last week holy moly I'm over it I don't want to see any more Burmese anymore
5604172	5610156	There's some event going on in the game, and for whatever reason, the Burmese spawns are increased by like five times as part of the event.
5610256	5611457	It's caught so many of them.
5611998	5612478	It's wild.
5612758	5613959	But I've gotten some more shinies.
5613999	5616181	I caught a shiny Meowth today very randomly.
5616581	5618763	I have to... One reason why I don't...
5619713	5620614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5639847	5642489	I still do a lot of Pokemon Go catching.
5642550	5644171	I keep running out of Pokeballs, though.
5644651	5655401	So, like, I'll have to run it for a walk, and then when I drive a quick errand, I have to set it to spin stops only, and then make sure I actually get through all my fucking gifts that I can in a day, and all of that stuff.
5655642	5660706	So, yeah, Bobby in chat says, yes, Rob cleared the weekly challenges before I could contribute again.
5661507	5662148	You're welcome?
5662168	5662268	Okay.
5664495	5674157	Um, but I, but I also recognize I have had a change in my own habits and that's how I'm going to be doing it because I walk a lot.
5674297	5682259	So there is no, I don't feel any sort of way about other folks because I'm pushing my own goals, if that makes sense.
5682499	5687640	So, um, yeah, I haven't seen any shiny Burmese with all those Burmese.
5687800	5688761	I agree with you in chat.
5689241	5690741	That is a weird thing I've noticed.
5692971	5695633	Oh yeah, and I did do some of the mega raids.
5696214	5698316	I did a mega Audino.
5698596	5702280	Because I've been playing more Pokemon Go, I've been remembering to put my Pokemon in gyms every day.
5702680	5703901	So I'm actually getting coins again.
5704949	5711094	And I actually, I bought remote passes just because, God, it's so much easier to just do the Mega Adino.
5711114	5713336	And then there was a Tauros today that's regional.
5714437	5719101	I think from, I think it's a Galarian variant, I think, that I did today.
5719181	5720902	So I've been able to do that, which is nice.
5720942	5727107	I love, the best quality of life thing they've put in Pokemon Go in a while is that instead of friends inviting you to raids, well, they can still do that.
5727668	5730990	If you go into your list of friends, you see who's in a raid right now.
5731411	5732772	And so, like, I was like, oh...
5733212	5735673	Somebody's doing a Pokemon that is a gray outline.
5735753	5736533	I don't have this yet.
5736593	5737173	What are they doing?
5737373	5737673	Oh, okay.
5737693	5739314	I'll hop in, which is kind of nice.
5739874	5741175	So, all right.
5741335	5742015	That was my game of the week.
5742795	5743375	Let's move on.
5743455	5747376	We have some other stories this week that actually don't have to do a Nintendo, believe it or not.
5747817	5752038	DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with the successes of a non-Nintendo game.
5753682	5760268	And this is supposed to be kind of hinted at like a Sims killer or at least a huge competitor.
5760808	5766093	And that's a game called Inzoy by Krafton, as in PUBG folks.
5767534	5776803	But now, even though it's in early access, it has topped a million sales within its week of launching.
5776823	5777283	Hmm.
5778344	5799566	and so they're really they're calling it a player friendly operational strategy and they're really excited about how many people have adopted it and that they want to be known as more than just the PUBG company they have a subsidiary studio which is Enzoi Studio that's handling this
5800658	5815810	and this is a game that's actually on my wish list although I've been debating whether or not I'm gonna get it because I need to know a little bit more about how their AI technology works in it because apparently you can use AI tools in the game to give it a prompt and then it will make like a
5816010	5820614	Pattern or something like patterns for clothing and things like that.
5821475	5823516	And I need to know a little bit more about it.
5823636	5830382	Like if it's all in-house art generated or how much of user input it uses to train their models.
5830442	5831343	I don't know enough about it.
5832263	5836967	But it definitely looks prettier than the Sims games.
5837287	5842512	It's still stylized, but it almost looks like what a lot of my Sims mods look like.
5845794	5868779	so it's I think I might take the plunge on it but it certainly is and there's already videos out there too with people building a house in the Sims and then rebuilding it in Enzoi and showing the comparison between how the building tools work and apparently Enzoi's building tools are a lot more intuitive
5869588	5894886	I don't know a lot about this game at all besides what you're saying now so I brought up a YouTube to play us some b-roll somebody's playing a long play right now and it's like they're putting together like this they're choosing to put crocodiles in their animal sanctuary then they have like lights that glow and all this looks very um fancy very fancy it's very pretty like and I I'm pretty sure that my Mac would play it with no problem I am it's it's
5896141	5909371	It does have a little bit more realism, but it also has that sort of, I don't know, it just has that specific aesthetic that you see in like watching Asian dramas.
5910992	5912113	That's the only way I can describe it.
5913021	5913481	Interesting.
5914402	5916302	This game was totally not on my radar.
5917363	5917883	Kind of feel.
5918303	5918663	It's $40.
5919944	5922765	So on top of that, it's actually not like Duke Nukem.
5924486	5926147	That character did look kind of like Duke Nukem.
5926167	5926767	That's really funny.
5926787	5928848	Interesting.
5928868	5929628	But isn't it really pretty?
5929868	5932509	Yeah, the graphics in this are gorgeous.
5932569	5933630	That's interesting.
5934210	5937231	QuestBuster in chat says there's already a ton of mods available for this.
5937711	5941293	So there's also that, even though it's early access.
5941877	5968949	yeah and my thing is that while I would love to do the mods I would have to figure out how to if it will run into whiskey and then if I can make my mods run through whiskey so wish me luck if I decide to go that route good luck all right well I look forward to potentially you streaming this game in the future who knows all right god I need I need more nights in the week yeah mood I'm not quitting ballet to stream again uh Loki you have more on the Minecraft movie
5969815	5977997	Yes, so ironically enough, there has been an early work print of Minecraft the movie that has leaked online.
5978517	5983118	It was with unfinished visuals and different editing.
5983678	5994561	And funny enough, I actually took a look at it, and there are some extended parts of this that are not in the movie that they decided to cut out for whatever reason.
5994581	5995761	Because there are some spots like...
5997342	6003544	It felt very sudden or unexplained, and then there's additional context with some of these deleted scenes as well.
6005104	6009525	So it's an interesting look at the movie-making process, but I'm sure that Warner Bros.
6009585	6010365	isn't too happy about it.
6010385	6011946	But also, I don't care what Warner Bros.
6011966	6019888	thinks, because it made it such a hassle to get the new Looney Tunes Acme vs. Coyote movie out, so to hell with them.
6022148	6023809	Hey, but we're finally going to get that movie!
6025250	6025830	That's exciting.
6025991	6026291	Yeah.
6026811	6036559	Do you feel the way about seeing those deleted scenes in context with having already seen a movie that it adds to your experience in watching the movie?
6036819	6037500	It does.
6038060	6039241	Not to give away too much.
6040062	6044485	There's this weird gag that they keep saying that Steve smells.
6044665	6047968	They're like, why do I smell like cheese?
6048088	6051751	He's like, well, I like to keep a piece of gorgonzola in my front pocket.
6052451	6053892	It's never explained...
6054867	6055868	Why he does that.
6055948	6058711	Like, it's just a weird, like, oh, he's just weird, and he does that.
6059011	6068319	But, like, in the work print, he explains, I keep this in my front pocket because it's my best friend's favorite food, and I miss him so much.
6068379	6070521	He's talking about his dog that he's trying to save.
6070922	6074665	And so it gives additional context to that, like, that it's missing from the movie.
6074705	6077968	It's really only a few seconds, but for whatever reason, they chose to cut it out.
6078188	6080730	There's also another scene when they go to the Woodland Mansion where they're like,
6081491	6086914	Trying to run interference by singing this song and dance with these saxophones or whatever.
6087675	6089576	And it's just kind of out of nowhere.
6089996	6091337	But the beginning, they...
6092538	6100542	This cut of it has it where they are talking about, oh yeah, we're going to do a birthday gram type thing.
6100742	6107706	And so they have added context to it that's not in the movie, but they cut it out to save on runtime or something.
6108206	6108947	I don't really know.
6109067	6109607	It's weird.
6110267	6114009	There's also another musical number that's kind of cut out as well from the office scene.
6114069	6117111	But other than that, it's pretty similar.
6117751	6118752	It's just cut down a bit.
6118792	6119752	So I guess you'll see these...
6120993	6121253	All right.
6151530	6178606	something like that with movies too yeah I think deleted scenes can be fun like the types that give the additional context and things they cut out yeah sometimes they're pointless but sometimes they're interesting I want to talk about this story that has to do with good old Billy Mitchell whose name continues to come up throughout the gaming industry and all this although this is an interesting story because even though it's about Billy Mitchell and a lot of the
6179246	6180207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6195883	6209734	and this has to do with the fact that Billy Mitchell was basically the recipient of this law determination where a YouTuber named Carl Jobst will have to pay over $230,000
6213477	6221843	in damages to Billy Mitchell because of defamatory comments that were found made by Carl Jobst in a video that was published back in 2001.
6222223	6230129	Now, I'm not sure if that $237,000, if that is an Australian dollar figure or if that's converted into U.S.
6230149	6230429	dollars.
6230509	6231910	No, that's converted to U.S.
6231950	6232771	You're right, it is.
6232791	6234372	$380,000 Australian dollars.
6234472	6234832	Thank you.
6236073	6236593	Oh, really?
6236994	6239536	Bobby says, I'm in the same YouTube video.
6240396	6264277	I didn't know that so Bobby Blackwolf was in an Australian court of law at some point in this video because okay so Bobby did some panel at Southern Pride Game Expo that had Billy Mitchell on it but Billy Mitchell in Billy Mitchell's way kind of took over that whole fucking panel and Bobby really didn't get to get a word in edgewise and so he's there
6264737	6265418	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6279921	6280582	Defamation.
6281122	6283023	It was found that Carl Jobst has to pay.
6283063	6283664	And here's why.
6284144	6287726	It actually has nothing to do with the Donkey Kong scandal.
6288127	6291909	It's not that he was calling out the scandal or anything like that.
6292029	6292810	Here's the thing.
6293470	6298194	The video was called The Biggest Con Men in Video Game History Strike Again.
6299074	6322891	and basically implied in the video that the settlement that Billy Mitchell did with another YouTuber, Benjamin Smith or Apollo Legend, who had done several videos claiming Billy Mitchell had cheated, basically said that, you know, as a result of the cheating thing, that Benjamin Smith had to pay a large sum of money and unfortunately took his own life in 2020, you know,
6325373	6325893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6348220	6350382	That was the defamation.
6351103	6356547	Insinuating that Billy Mitchell took delight in this other YouTuber taking his own life.
6357208	6358189	That was the problem.
6358849	6361351	It had nothing to do with the actual Donkey Kong.
6361371	6363413	It had nothing to do with the video game at the end of the day.
6363873	6373622	And everything to do with the really strange cult of celebrity that continues to surround a lot of these Twin Galaxy folks, but mostly Billy Mitchell.
6375034	6375954	And so that was it.
6376054	6382297	So the judge, Ken Barlow, said that the 2020 settlement between Mitchell and Smith never involved the exchange of money.
6382737	6393161	Smith had to remove all the YouTube video and social media posts that were relating, assign copyright, and to cease publishing about Billy Mitchell or would have a $25,000 fine for each breach.
6394202	6396923	And then there were some other claims made in the video that were found to be untrue.
6398063	6401785	In a post on X, Jope said, I lost...
6402045	6402465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6423021	6424522	I thought he would win that case, honestly.
6424903	6425964	But I'm surprised.
6426084	6428666	Don't YouTubers sometimes need to be held accountable for some of this?
6429487	6432109	Some of this hysteria has to have a point.
6432770	6438795	And I would have a problem if somebody said that I took delight in somebody taking their own life.
6439495	6441457	I would have a real problem with that.
6441497	6447883	It's like, talk all the shit you want about Donkey Kong, but there are certain lines that should not be crossed for the sake of clicks.
6449402	6477922	and I don't know that was just that's that's not great optics um I I have not seen the video because I don't give a fuck about this situation I haven't given a fuck about it for a long time and I've never nor should I give a fuck nor should anybody give a fuck about this situation as far as I'm concerned but here we are anyway just consider if you're gonna do a video to hate on somebody
6479733	6485978	Are you actually helping that person more than... Forget it.
6487119	6487900	I'm yelling at a wall.
6488481	6490022	Alright, let's move on.
6490382	6490903	DarkSakura.
6493297	6495658	Well, here's some shit news.
6496638	6497918	I'm just gonna call it like it is.
6498639	6503080	Eidos Montreal laid off 75 developers.
6504480	6512663	They were pulling their mandate to restructure the company and apply their staff and finish their projects.
6513043	6516844	And once all that came to fruition, they...
6518184	6519065	I'll just read the quote.
6519085	6527368	Today we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members as one of our mandates is coming to an end.
6527828	6536933	It's not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately we don't have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.
6538013	6542355	So if you value them so much, why aren't you putting more effort into it?
6544213	6571336	um and they go on to say that they are quote committed to deliver its other projects currently in development which is supposed to be Fable I guess anyway um so and another GameLoss jobs version Australian studio uh PlaySide is uh also doing layoffs even after they have made record revenue for them um
6572736	6598522	they've pulled in 64.6 million Australian dollars which would be about 40.9 million US and that they were it was triggered by delays for winning work for higher contracts and they want new winning new contract work but said that things remain uncertain for them so
6601485	6601725	Yeah.
6603086	6604408	Just bleh.
6604948	6606990	Yeah.
6607210	6608531	Bleh!
6608551	6615177	This is a complicated... Continues to be a very complicated issue because there's a lot of people that are going to point to...
6616297	6620841	You don't like to hear these types of stories, but you don't want to pay $80 for a video game.
6621562	6625145	But I think fundamentally, the system is just kind of broken.
6625625	6633672	And I think it came to a point that several people were saying in chat earlier about the bubble is bursting on AAA games is what it's really coming down to.
6633712	6639697	The bubble is really bursting on AAA games, which to some extent has been the case with AAA movies for a bit, too.
6639757	6640978	They don't want to greenlight movies anymore.
6641238	6642540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6665822	6670544	You can make a return on investment by charging $40 or $50 a game versus $80.
6670744	6674485	I think it's this weird reckoning we're in within the industry.
6674665	6679946	But anyway, it's still very sad news to hear across the board.
6680046	6685248	And I think the entire industry really needs to re-advise, especially those at the top.
6685328	6689069	And I think some companies recognize it better than others.
6689529	6691430	And that's directly with who's at the top.
6692410	6694691	Because again, you look at the decision Ubisoft makes.
6696431	6698572	How that company's still in business, I don't know sometimes.
6699153	6701874	But then you look at the decisions that other companies make.
6702595	6708298	So far, up until this week, Nintendo was riding quite the high.
6709519	6712040	It's going to be interesting now to see if that continues for them.
6713141	6717483	And I'm not sure even I want to take a crystal ball to that, to see how this is going to go.
6717503	6722146	Because I think there is too much unpredictability with what's going on with our dear leader.
6723871	6728554	All right, Loki, let's talk about some good news, something you were excited about.
6729375	6730095	Go direct.
6730356	6730836	That's right.
6731016	6740983	It was the April 1st Goat Simulator announcement video where they talked about different updates and things coming to the Goat Simulator game.
6742384	6744446	Mostly side projects.
6744786	6748709	So, for example, one of the first things that they announced was the Goat Simulator game.
6749329	6750230	The Card Game.
6750710	6754833	They are giving you a physical card game that is launching on Kickstarter April 30th.
6755813	6766861	And it allows you to play a goat simulator type game with all the different goats and gear that they have in the game.
6766881	6769743	All the goats!
6771324	6772024	Yep, yep, yep.
6773925	6775446	More goats in Goat Simulator?
6775526	6776147	You don't say.
6778241	6791928	Then we have the Goat Simulator cross CRKD, the Nitro Deck and Neo S. They are a, it's basically like a little Goat Simulator themed wireless controller.
6792449	6796751	And I don't know if this is something that plugs into like the Steam Deck or it's like a Steam Deck type thing.
6799052	6804115	Yeah, a new controller collection and console decked out for themed artwork.
6804727	6805327	Nitro Deck.
6806368	6811351	Oh, apparently it's also those work with the Nintendo Switch as well, Bluetooth controllers.
6812512	6813472	Neat, I guess.
6813853	6815173	I don't really know what those things are.
6816894	6822678	Then for the actual game itself, there was the Goat Simulator 3 Gifts from the Rift.
6823178	6824119	It's 27 new gear items.
6827921	6828421	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6857037	6859320	but didn't really say what it is.
6860641	6862583	It's just coming and being worked on.
6863124	6865426	So we will have to see what that is.
6865587	6868670	But if it's anything like the last one, it should be pretty good.
6869971	6873675	How much money did you lose watching this Goat Simulator Direct?
6873715	6875638	Meaning, what are you planning on buying in the future?
6877335	6878876	I'll buy the new DLC when it comes out.
6879036	6883140	I just don't know what it is and when it's coming out.
6884060	6888323	I'm definitely not buying the board game, nor am I getting the plushie or the controllers.
6889084	6897230	We didn't get into it at all, but if you want to hear an industry that's getting fucked by our dear leader and their tariff situation, look at what's happening with board games.
6897290	6901734	Bobby detailed this on his show a lot tonight, especially indie published board games.
6902415	6904917	Those that, you know, have the indie stuff that's published overseas.
6905338	6911885	Just an industry that is going to be disrupted majorly by all of this Washington fuckery that's happening.
6912366	6913587	So, yeah.
6914829	6915089	Anyway.
6916130	6916430	All right.
6916811	6916971	Well.
6916971	6917991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6934657	6936538	I think the concept of the Evercade's pretty cool.
6936658	6944782	Yes, it's an emulator with cartridges, but I still like the collection concept and, you know, the fact that, you know, it's a pretty nice piece of hardware to play this stuff on.
6945162	6947664	And there's another piece of hardware that's been announced that's coming out.
6948024	6950625	It's the Super Pocket Neo Geo Edition.
6950985	6955627	It is a $60 handheld, not a terrible price, that's set to release in June 2025.
6956128	6957789	Again, assuming that, you know...
6958889	6961572	Everything fucky going on at Washington doesn't double that price.
6961932	6963593	We'll just assume for now it's going to stay $60.
6963714	6972522	It is a Neo Geo Pocket Super Pocket Edition that will have SNK arcade games in it.
6972862	6978947	It's a black and gold color scheme that looks like a Neo Geo arcade cabinet and has 14 titles built in.
6979688	6998633	Alpha Mission 2, Blazing Star, Fatal Fury Special, King of the Monsters 2 The Next Thing, Last Resort, Metal Slug X, Mutation Nation, Overtop, Samurai Shodown 2, Sengoku 3, Shock Troopers Second Squad, Soccer Brawl, The Last Blade, and Top Hunter, Roddy and Kathy.
6999894	7001114	Fucking love Last Blade.
7001803	7018824	Top Hunter there's a lot of those on Blue Sky but anyway I don't know I don't know that game as well um DarkSakura though you're a Neo Geo fan what do you think of this lineup it's pretty seems pretty solid to me Last Blade worth it for Last Blade fair enough um
7020245	7025408	Now, I believe they are also releasing a cartridge that just has six of those games in it.
7025648	7030150	There also is a Data East version, which is ironic because it's off camera a little bit.
7030170	7035232	But if you look way to the side, I do have a Data East Arcade 1UP cabinet that has some of these games.
7035332	7041575	There also is a Pocket Data East Edition coming that, of course, has BurgerTime, of course, Bad Dudes and Dragon Ninja and Joe and Mac.
7041856	7047238	But it also has one of the sequels, Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory, Lock and Chase, TumblePop.
7047518	7048939	There's a lot of interesting games there.
7049479	7051881	I wanted to see if we had the Neo Geo.
7052101	7058605	I like the, now I do like the limited edition with the red and white stripes.
7058966	7060527	Oh yeah, there's a limited edition.
7060647	7061808	Yeah, that looks cool.
7062268	7072375	Now there is also an Evercade cartridge coming, Neo Geo Arcade 1, implying the existence of more than one at some point, but this is all we know about so far.
7072735	7078899	So there will be a cartridge that you could put into any device, which would include the machine behind me,
7079779	7087743	which would have Metal Slug, King of Fighters 2000, Sengoku, Magician Lord, Shock Troopers, and Ironclad.
7088704	7093666	Not a bad lineup for one singular cartridge that will play on all the other Evercade devices.
7094667	7095927	That's pretty rad.
7096547	7103531	And keep in mind, these Neo Geo Super Pockets, they will have the 14 games built in, but then you can use the cartridges to add more.
7103931	7132254	that's very similar to the bad boy that sits behind me here it has the Mega Man so I know it's hard to see but it has some Capcom classics built in like Arcade Strider, Mega Man Power Battle 1 and 2 that's what the marquee theming is Final Fight are all in here but they are like they're baked into the firmware on this machine so they're not cartridges so ironically what I have in here right now I have the Mega Man and then I have two Namco cartridges in there so it's like a Cap...
7132654	7138660	Cap Namco arcade machine I have behind me right now but the one thing I can't do Ms.
7138680	7140562	Pac-Man isn't on the cartridge so I can't have Ms.
7140602	7153816	Pac-Man on both anyway no all right since I brought up classic games this is a great time to get to our next segment let's get to it our sort of classic game of the week
7164409	7171692	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
7172152	7174753	It's time for the classic game of the week.
7175473	7188918	But in a 2025 twist, once a month, DarkSakura likes to instead pick a classic game to arcade, meaning this was once a console game but became an arcade game.
7189198	7191539	So DarkSakura, what is the classic game to arcade this week?
7195516	7199219	Fantasy Zone 2, The Tears of Opa Opa, Opa Opa no Namida
7218835	7244968	with ports all over the place and basically it's Opa Opa fighting his inner darkness and the game of course plays like Defender very similar with the big final boss and you have the shop you can buy stuff in and what not but there are there was an arcade version that was definitely
7246048	7271985	prettied up, made very nice and so it was done on the system e-board and that first one is almost identical to the Master System version it has a radar that shows you if your bases are destroyed or not a timer that if it reaches zero you'll lose life if you clear a level then your remaining seconds will be added to the score
7273145	7297943	um and uh this is uh this is okay but then there was the remake of Fantasy Zone 2 um and that was for System 16 um it was this is the one that's that's pretty and it is the considered a what if um
7300056	7308410	and the point of it was to stick to what would have been the technical limitations of
7310046	7314568	The game, if it would have been released at this time, this is in September 2008.
7314608	7323533	This is like if it had come out in arcades when it was supposed to have been released.
7323713	7334599	And the M2 CEO, Hori Naoki, had stated that the remake was inspired by his disappointment that Fantasy Zone didn't get a true arcade sequel.
7336720	7341862	I played the SMS game a lot, but in my heart of hearts, I really wanted to see it on arcade hardware.
7342703	7353028	And so they developed it on real System 16 hardware, only increasing the memory to 256 kilobytes.
7353388	7355049	And so they called this the System 16 C.
7357971	7371721	and it can even be played through their own emulation tech so it has a 1987 Sega copyright no mention of M2 and has really no other distinction from the original game
7373322	7375883	and it looks just like an arcade game from 1987.
7376664	7384749	Some fans have even called this Fantasy Zone 2 DX to tell it apart from the original arcade release.
7385490	7390873	And this is the one that I have those very, very fun memories of.
7391814	7396597	And Ohori actually funded this himself.
7397318	7401280	Apparently he said it cost about the same amount as a new car in 2008.
7403101	7425734	so it does follow Phantasy Zone 2 but a bit loosely it has enemies, music locations, and gameplay elements from the Master System games but it sets up new content and elements of the original Phantasy Zone so instead of having the distinct zones in each stage you have two parallel dimensions, the bright side and dark side
7426995	7445675	and they are comparable to the levels in the original fantasy zone you destroy the bases in one dimension they destroy in the other the dark side is more difficult but you get more rewards but the bosses are same on either side although they are more difficult to fight on the dark side
7446215	7454877	So the game has three endings which depend on whether dark side levels were cleared and whether some specific items were bought.
7455597	7457737	Getting the bad ending gives you a game over.
7459178	7475821	The music was arranged by Namiki Manabu and it has many of the songs from the Fantasy Zone 2 soundtrack but rearranged to be more stylistically to how the Fantasy Zone's original composer Kawaguchi Hiroshi would have
7476461	7476961	arrange them.
7478722	7481922	Stages and enemies are based off the themes from the original.
7482142	7483743	Some are a little bit different.
7484763	7488684	And only half the game's bosses correspond to those who are in the original.
7489284	7491984	So it's a very loose interpretation.
7493385	7503027	M2 did a free demo of their version of Phantasy Zone 2 on their website so that users could download and play the first and second levels on a Windows computer.
7503127	7504247	So, of course, it had been
7504947	7519136	bootlegged and released in arcades as FZ-2006-2 by a Taiwanese manufacturer called ISG it has a 2006 copyright date but apparently it's based off of the 2008 Playstation 2 release
7522399	7537153	because of a string recognized from the ROM data Sega did a limited number of arcade units that ran this on System 16 hardware instead of the emulated System 16 hardware from other releases
7539435	7548600	But yeah, this particular version also was ported to the Nintendo 3DS version of Fantasy Zone 2.
7549661	7554043	And it was called 3D Fantasy Zone 2W with new features and content.
7554984	7560587	And you could also do it in the survival mode with Oopa Oopa, who is Oopa Oopa's brother.
7562036	7589200	so it's kind of like that this was and this to me is like my favorite version of Fantasy Zone 2 but it's like they took Fantasy Zone 2 for the Master System did an arcade version did a remake of the arcade version and then ported that back to console but there you go yeah so that is Fantasy Zone 2 Opa Opa no Namida
7589537	7591523	Now, did you get a chance to play this in arcades?
7592746	7593267	Oh, heck yeah!
7593588	7596276	They had one at, um... Uh...
7597017	7620451	California Extreme a couple years ago and I think I spent a lot of time on this game and it's funny as much as I love Fantasy Zone I'm not really good when it comes to the bosses like I make stupid mistakes that's my problem because I'm too busy just getting into the vibe of the game but yeah they had this and it was a real one on a candy cab
7623013	7626057	at California Extreme a couple years ago and I keep hoping that they bring it back.
7626497	7629280	I need to fucking get to California Extreme this year.
7629300	7632944	There's always something going on the same weekend though but maybe this year.
7632964	7634686	Do you know what weekend it is yet?
7634706	7635947	We got a hotel room last time.
7636067	7636768	Maybe we'll do it again.
7636948	7638049	Do we know what weekend it is yet?
7638630	7639911	I need to block off that weekend.
7640882	7641503	But who knows?
7641743	7642243	All right, we'll see.
7642424	7642704	We'll see.
7643705	7644526	I like Orange Rite.
7644586	7647489	Orange Rite in chat says Fantasy Zone.
7648209	7648850	I don't know why.
7648930	7649230	I'm sorry.
7649251	7651973	I don't know why the follow noises from my personal stream come over here.
7652033	7653054	I still have not figured that out.
7653094	7654296	So sorry you get the random windows.
7654336	7655197	July 19th through 20th.
7656820	7658060	I have to check my calendar for that weekend.
7658821	7661502	Orange Rite says Fantasy Zone 2DX, huh?
7662122	7663363	I like that little pun.
7664443	7664923	That's cute.
7665243	7667524	Well, it does predate 2DX, but yeah.
7667784	7668285	No, does it?
7669005	7670886	Kind of contemporary, actually, I guess.
7671966	7673146	You said 19th and 20th?
7674707	7674947	Yeah.
7675447	7677668	Ooh, I am currently available that weekend.
7677708	7679449	It's the next weekend I'm hosting a show.
7679489	7680589	I think that's what happened to me last year.
7680609	7681710	I was hosting a show that weekend.
7681730	7682150	Yeah, I have to.
7682455	7685297	Double check when my ballet recital is because it's in July.
7686517	7686778	All right.
7688158	7688419	Wonderful.
7688459	7689799	Yeah, for sure.
7689839	7690400	I'd love to go.
7691741	7695703	Okay, let's move on to another story.
7695823	7696664	Actually, a series of stories.
7696684	7702807	Let's do some rapid fire news and talk about a few headlines that all that Nintendo Switch news, Switch 2 news at the beginning.
7703748	7708431	You know, we have to run through a few other headlines pretty quickly because again, if you're just joining us,
7708891	7714637	We talked a lot about the Switch 2 in the opening hour of the show tonight, so we're trying to cover some of the other headlines at this point.
7715338	7724948	Do remember you can always download this show as a podcast where all of your favorite podcasts are served, whether that is Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube has podcasting built in as well.
7725729	7727971	All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news.
7728031	7728212	Loki.
7729515	7734016	Pokemon Go Fest 2025 has been announced, and we have the dates now for those.
7734756	7746680	It's going to be in Osaka, Japan, May 29th through June 1st, Jersey City from June 6th to the 8th, and Paris, France, June 13th through the 15th.
7747860	7751061	You can get your tickets now, or you can participate...
7753018	7753398	So, yeah.
7771371	7771731	Neat.
7772451	7776112	I'm enjoying a Pokemon Go renaissance right now, so it sounds kind of exciting.
7776232	7780774	Although, we still have to feel out how is the Scopely sale going to change things.
7780874	7784294	But again, I'm not going to react to predictions.
7784855	7788876	I'm going to react to what they announce, the changes they're going to make.
7790721	7791622	when they decide to make them.
7791702	7805229	Although I will say on that same front, I don't know if you heard about this, they did announce this week that because Wayfarer, Niantic Wayfarer was sold to Scopely as well, they're going to be splitting the database of points of interest.
7805749	7817936	So at an undisclosed date in the future, probably when this whole deal closes, the network that powers Ingress portals will now be separate from the network that powers
7818516	7827526	Pokemon Go, Pokestops, Pikmin Mushrooms, and whatever it was called in Monster Hunter now, the zones or whatever they are in those.
7828006	7830148	Yeah, which is the way it should have been from the very beginning.
7830228	7835414	PvP and PvE should have never been mixed, but I understand that was not Niantic's goal in this whole thing.
7835774	7837296	But that's going to be very interesting with this split.
7838397	7840539	So I was playing Ingress the other day.
7841500	7852086	and I was in a neighborhood and there was something called a geo marker that somebody had submitted and got added and you could tell this was a big Pokemon Go neighborhood where they submitted every little fucking thing as Pokemon Go.
7852446	7854707	Do you know what this thing was that they got in Pokemon Go?
7855248	7864353	It was one of those little tiny ass fucking quarter sized markers that they put at the boundary of a house to denote where one property stops and the other one begins.
7865851	7866811	And that was a Pokestop.
7867812	7871073	And I'm like, I cannot wait for this bullshit to no longer be in Ingress.
7872833	7875054	Because again, I don't care about Pokestops.
7875174	7877775	Pokestops in front of people's houses, I don't give a shit about.
7878195	7882436	But it's when people in that game unfortunately get very selfish.
7882516	7885877	I've literally heard Pokemon Go players say, who cares about Ingress?
7886217	7887278	Who cares about the other games?
7887678	7888098	Who cares?
7888578	7889298	That's their problem.
7889918	7894360	To which I say, and for those on the podcast feed, I'm raising my middle finger.
7895336	7898297	Alright, let's move on.
7899157	7899677	DarkSakura.
7902558	7911141	So, Squinnix has launched a website for Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary.
7913422	7920484	It has a mention of a picture book, the Final Fantasy IX picture book, VV, Grandpa, and the Day of Departure.
7921524	7941842	and there's a lottery with details to be announced Zoff vs. Final Fantasy IX Collaboration Glasses due out in July Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary Official Goods and then a vinyl called the Anniversary Vinyl Timeless Tale due on July 9th for 4,950 yen so yay yay
7949839	7953060	I have a story that is a yay for game preservation actually.
7954241	7965745	Rockman Cosmo on social media has discussed a 23 title game preservation effort for Konami mobile games.
7966185	7969867	These were originally developed for iMode compatible Japanese phones.
7970707	7973628	These games have now been dumped and preserved online.
7973968	7974269	DarkSakura,
7990409	8002455	In the report on social media from Rockman Cosmo, it talked about Gradius Neo, Gradius Neo Imperial, because these were exclusive to this platform, as well as Castlevania, Twimby, Parodius.
8002835	8003396	Pretty cool.
8003436	8008098	These were originally launched around 2004 for iMode and Yahoo!
8008458	8013281	Kei Tai compatible phones, eventually making their way to EasyWeb phones as well.
8014641	8015682	Kei Tai means cell phone.
8016201	8016982	Oh, Keita Isobo.
8017062	8018124	Cool.
8018204	8025694	Anyway, there's a big old list of the games that have been preserved, and there is actually a Discord from the Keita Wiki.
8026615	8033584	I didn't even know that was a thing until now, but KeitaWiki.com, where you can get those games and the efforts to save them and preserve them.
8034085	8062703	that's pretty cool even if like I'm pretty sure we had very similar versions of these games on like remember I used to have this sprint flip phone that played these color games and like there were so I had like a Castlevania game on it it ran like shit it ran like shit but it kind of looked like Castlevania uh so it's neat you know what it's a part of gaming's history even the not so pretty stuff deserves to be preserved so that we can learn never to do it again I'm just kidding
8063499	8068864	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out very soon.
8068904	8069165	Loki.
8070566	8083098	All right, so this week we've got, let's see, Battlefield Waltz on Nintendo Switch, Ixion on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
8084079	8087761	South of Midnight on PC and Xbox Series.
8087821	8089621	Oh, a lot of people talking about that one.
8089641	8090362	I want to see that one.
8090382	8091422	Yeah, that one looks pretty good.
8092803	8097545	Commando's Origins on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.
8098447	8102428	Descendants Next, or I'm sorry, Descenders Next.
8102708	8107489	That's on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox One and Xbox Series.
8108950	8110430	And let's see.
8110450	8111631	Oh, one more day here.
8113091	8118372	All in Abyss, Judge the Fake on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5.
8119413	8123254	Blueprints on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
8124014	8127655	Crashlands 2 on PC, iOS, and Android.
8129609	8134511	Let's see, Monaco 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
8135471	8142914	Ninja Hayate HD Remaster and TimeGal HD Remaster on PC.
8144015	8149497	Pocket Bravery on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
8150818	8158762	We've got Promised Mascot Agency on the PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
8159542	8163004	Snow Brothers 2 Special on PC and Nintendo Switch.
8164004	8166205	Star Overdrive on Nintendo Switch.
8167125	8170947	Steel Seed on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
8172047	8178710	And last but not least, The Talos Principle Reawakened on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
8178730	8179591	I forgot that was coming.
8179671	8179871	Cool.
8181124	8183566	Progress Orders, Memories of Susu, Not Always True
8200860	8204602	and then we have the ACA Neo Geo Selection Volume 3 and 4.
8205022	8207263	That would be ACA Arcade Archives.
8208163	8217186	So in the Arcade Archives Neo Geo Volume 3, you get Three Count Bout, Baseball Stars 2, Blazing Star, Fatal Fury, King of Fighters, King of Fighters 96.
8218887	8224510	Last Resort, Ninja Kombat, Samurai Shodown 3, Blades of Blood, Sengoku, and World Heroes Perfect.
8225251	8235496	And in the Arcade Archives, these are all things that you could download piecemeal if you want, but these cartridge collections make a real great kind of catch-up mechanism for those of you that maybe haven't done that.
8236357	8251277	Arcade Archives for Neo Geo is Art of Fighting 3, King of Fighters 2000, The Last Blade, Metal Slug, Neo Geo Cup 98, The Road to the Victory, Ninja Commando, Polestar, Puzzled, Ragnagard, and The Super Spy.
8253416	8265649	All this talk about arcade archives makes me realize, though, the game I meant to pick up this week was Tetris the Grandmaster Vol.
8265669	8267852	4 because a lot of you in chat have been losing your minds over it.
8268192	8275457	and I've also actually I played both Tetris Connected and some other Tetris game that played on a PlayStation 5 this week because those are fun multiplayer.
8275497	8278940	I'm not good at fighting games multiplayer, but I will play some Tetris multiplayer.
8278960	8284003	So I'm going to get Grandmaster because I literally have never really gotten into a Grandmaster game.
8284403	8288987	I've watched it during like, you know, Games Done Quick and other stuff, but I've never really gotten into it.
8289007	8289487	I think I want to
8289807	8293409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

8461380	8463921	Alright, well we have one more story for you tonight.
8464061	8467123	Unfortunately, not a good one, but an important one to talk about.
8467223	8467503	Loki.
8469184	8477388	Yeah, so we have word that Bill Petras, who was a veteran Blizzard Entertainment employee, has passed away.
8478308	8483771	He spent 30 years in the gaming industry, starting off, you know, of course, he was
8485244	8490228	In the gaming industry in the 90s, worked on games like Ripper, Star Crusade, and Blood Net.
8490528	8501175	Joined Blizzard Entertainment to work on art with Storyboard 3D and Cinematic Art for StarCraft, as well as the art director for World of Warcraft.
8501736	8507680	Later left and then came back to work on, of course, Overwatch as well.
8508841	8509021	So...
8510900	8511900	That is unfortunate.
8511981	8514863	I don't know what he passed away from, but I guess it doesn't really matter.
8515404	8519207	Yeah, sometimes they keep that secret to the family and that's none of our business.
8520268	8523812	But very sad, tragic loss there for a lot of big games.
8524132	8524953	So, unfortunate.
8526124	8528906	Well, we'll try to move from that over to the listener roundtable.
8528986	8531968	I want to invite your comments and things.
8532328	8538032	We also welcome your blue sky posts every week at our blue sky over at orange.com.
8538552	8539813	And we welcome your emails.
8539973	8542134	Participate at orange.com.
8542475	8545857	We would love to get some emails that weren't spam once in a while.
8546357	8550180	I don't believe we have any tonight unless it changed in the last six hours.
8550220	8550420	Yeah.
8550740	8552020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8578288	8578629	Anyway.
8579730	8580751	I was doing it.
8582553	8582893	All right.
8583514	8585657	Let's get to... What?
8586998	8587639	Rob!
8588420	8588840	Coffee.
8590262	8590902	I did the thing.
8591403	8592624	Yeah.
8592785	8598691	We have a comment from... I'm going to horribly mispronounce this name, but it's Mate...
8599625	8608668	Rick Z, I'm sorry if I'm Matrix, maybe Matrix, Matrix Z, I bet, is asking, wait, this is on YouTube as well.
8609028	8624313	So this doesn't stream live to YouTube, but it will, our podcast, so we used to be on a thing called Google Podcasts, and they actually sunset that, and they just said, YouTube supports podcasting now, so you can upload your podcast to YouTube.
8624893	8640115	and so that's what we do we upload our podcast to YouTube so it isn't live on YouTube but you can get the audio podcast there at this time we do not have a video podcast archive there I'm not gonna say that's forever gonna be the case
8641076	8643638	Um, but for now, it's just the audio.
8643698	8645398	Same as you would get on Spotify.
8645479	8647199	Same as you would get on Apple Podcasts.
8647820	8651182	And, you know, we're Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.
8652122	8655724	So we focus on, you know, our discussions and audio first.
8655764	8663388	So that's usually why the video is just a little bonus for those of you that take the extra step to join us live on Sunday night.
8664109	8665069	Honestly, work.
8665469	8665970	Love that.
8666070	8666770	Baby steps.
8666810	8668351	Well, when it comes to YouTube, yes.
8669551	8669912	Actually,
8671093	8685235	I remember, now that you bring it up and we have a little bit more of an open segment, I remember years ago, Jason would take... Jason, our voiceover guy who works very hard behind the scenes with our show, would take these...
8686016	8708906	episodes and he would actually zhuzh them up a little bit for YouTube when we used to do segments like listless and a lot of the games we haven't done in a while we probably we really need to do one of those games it's been a while or like video game match game and some things we haven't done in a while which now if we would have to call that video game snatch game for more people to understand what it's a parody of but we used to do video game match game
8710792	8712774	I miss doing that, Rob.
8712834	8714035	I miss doing that.
8714055	8715957	We should schedule one in the coming weeks.
8716938	8720821	So Jason would actually have visuals up on screen that went with it and all that stuff.
8720841	8721662	And he worked very hard.
8721702	8725926	But unfortunately, it didn't get a lot of viewers on YouTube.
8726486	8729509	And so it was kind of one of those, is the juice worth the squeeze?
8729589	8730109	Maybe not.
8730790	8731170	I don't know.
8731571	8732452	So anyway.
8733790	8737412	But we always appreciate Jason's efforts of trying new things in that department and others.
8737472	8743396	But now that Google has the whole automatic import, I don't have to do anything to put this podcast on YouTube.
8743756	8746918	It automatically scrapes the feed and imports it and does all that stuff, which is great.
8747138	8747479	I love it.
8748019	8749380	And nothing ventured, nothing gained.
8749620	8750160	Exactly.
8750400	8752082	This could happen.
8753743	8755884	Honestly, we should probably have more TikToks up.
8756789	8757189	TikTok Singers
8779471	8782453	Tron Ares, that trailer came out for that movie, right?
8783133	8785855	And there's a lot of things I really like about this.
8785875	8787857	And I'm going to copy some of what I said in the TikTok.
8788677	8790358	Nine Inch Nails doing the soundtrack.
8790498	8792840	Look, you're never going to be Daft Punk.
8793200	8794701	You're never going to be Wendy Carlos.
8795342	8797403	But Nine Inch Nails is doing their own thing with it.
8797463	8798304	And I'm like, okay.
8798904	8800885	Like, I accept this.
8801005	8802927	This sounds like it's going to be pretty good.
8802947	8803787	It's going to be a banger.
8805128	8806969	Gillian Anderson being in the movie.
8807730	8809131	I look at her and I go,
8810311	8811532	Maybe I'm bisexual.
8813293	8814913	But she's a wonderful actress.
8815093	8816594	I'm really excited that she's in it.
8817735	8819515	And there's a lot of things to get excited about.
8819555	8822737	But then, Jared Leto's involved.
8824377	8825338	I'm not even mad about him.
8826138	8826999	I'm not mad about him.
8828000	8830061	He's not going to always be in bad movies.
8830581	8831782	I just don't like him.
8836025	8841629	Everybody's commenting on my TikTok going, you know, they wouldn't have made the movie if it wasn't for him.
8841849	8843310	Because he's an executive producer.
8843331	8844631	That's my opinion!
8849468	8850208	I don't like him.
8850869	8851589	I don't know though.
8851669	8864537	Was it just me or I just had like this mental traumatic backlash to seeing a giant pixel Pac-Man going across the screen when I was seeing light cycles and recognizers in the real world.
8867679	8869600	I'm having to do this in chat right now.
8871536	8878103	One of the first things that Bobby said was, isn't Jared Leto the only reason the movie is even happening?
8878143	8881688	So I had to do a slap with a large trout to throw back to the MIRC days.
8886009	8891291	Hello to Jay Helinski in chat who says his music is okay, but I can't stand anything he does otherwise.
8891771	8900235	I mean, I associate his music with like a certain type of 2004 era emo that I can't say I've heard his music in many, many, many years.
8900255	8903736	Further down the spiral is the album that got me through college the first time.
8903776	8908298	No, no, I'm not talking about I think I believe the comments about Jared Leto, not Nine Inch Nails.
8908318	8908878	Oh, really?
8910219	8912180	He was the singer of 36 Seconds to Mars, right?
8913520	8914601	Am I mixing them up with somebody else?
8915701	8916541	No, no, you're not.
8916861	8917402	Okay, okay.
8917762	8921583	No, Nine Inch Nails is... Oh, God, Nine Inch Nails has always been fucking fantastic.
8921623	8924424	I was like, why are you saying things about Nine Inch Nails?
8924445	8924645	No!
8924805	8929727	Oh my God, same girl, like the Downward Spiral was my goth album.
8930207	8930587	Loved it.
8931907	8935589	I never listened to 30 Seconds to Mars, like, ever.
8936829	8938850	I like the premise of the movie.
8939130	8940071	I'm just worried.
8941144	8941944	I'll still go see it.
8941984	8943205	I mean, whatever.
8943405	8944985	Let's not kid ourselves.
8946105	8949506	Look, there's a fucking machine right there in my background.
8949587	8953128	For those watching live on Twitch, for those on the podcast feed, I'm sure you've seen a picture at some point.
8954108	8959629	As a Tron fan, as someone who wants this franchise to succeed, I'm going to fucking see it.
8960210	8962290	But I'm also going to voice my concerns.
8963311	8964751	I have the latest box set.
8965992	8966872	I love Legacy.
8966952	8970575	That still is perfectly functional.
8971196	8976360	Somebody in the fucking TikTok comments dared to call Tron Legacy a mid-movie.
8977041	8980744	And I was like, you people say anything on the internet and not get punished for it.
8980764	8984387	Well, compared to the original Tron... Sue that person for defamation.
8985968	8987249	Compared to the original Tron...
8990114	8990815	They're different.
8991115	8991836	They're different.
8992116	8993858	Tron is my favorite Disney movie.
8994038	8994618	No, I get it.
8994718	8995079	I get it.
8996540	8997501	I'm a little concerned.
8997781	9003047	I will say now that the comment that made me chuckle was with all the Tron stuff in the real world.
9003107	9006830	Somebody had commented, isn't this just the plot of the movie Pixels?
9006850	9007431	Yeah.
9007887	9008848	And that made me laugh.
9008868	9011691	Did you not hear me say the comment about the giant Pac-Man?
9011731	9012792	Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
9013032	9019979	But I am a little concerned about that, but we'll see how it turns out.
9021181	9021541	We'll see.
9022702	9025445	Anyway, that's true.
9025585	9028288	S2100Matt says, we'll go to Disney to buy the Ares merch.
9028388	9029609	I still need to go on that ride.
9030330	9030970	in Orlando.
9032151	9036254	They don't have it in Anaheim, which is where I've been more often.
9036334	9037675	We need a petition.
9037715	9038475	Where are they going to put it?
9038755	9040236	Everyone, go to change.org.
9042308	9044991	Oh wait, NoChange.org doesn't actually get anything done.
9046472	9047312	Where are they going to build it?
9047733	9055299	I guess there's the rumors that they're going to tear down the thing next, or they're going to turn the Toy Story parking lot and where the P.F.
9055339	9064127	Chang's is, that whole little block that Disney actually owns, that is going to become like a third property, but that's not going to happen for like 10 fucking years.
9065588	9065968	Build up.
9066629	9067690	But I want to go to Orlando.
9068991	9070412	Go from the PeopleMover and go up.
9071300	9076004	I will say, my Star Trek cruise next year goes out of Orlando.
9076625	9085412	And I am absolutely, absolutely, absolutely considering either padding that time before or after with theme park time.
9085792	9088294	Because not only do I want to do Disney, do you know what else I want to do?
9089596	9090256	Epic Universe.
9090356	9090676	Although...
9091877	9097220	I'm concerned because I guess a big chunk of Epic Universe is Harry Potter, which in the year 2025, can you imagine?
9097920	9102542	But the Nintendo Land there is apparently twice as big as the one in L.A.
9102682	9103763	and has the Donkey Kong ride.
9106444	9106644	Yeah.
9107824	9108305	Yeah, that's true.
9108325	9114928	Bobby says, so only do a half day at Epic Universe or as I understand, three fourths of a day because it's the Harry Potter stuff is a quarter of the park.
9115208	9115788	So we'll see.
9116669	9117029	We'll see.
9118730	9118810	Um.
9120390	9120771	Let's see.
9121592	9127038	Jay Helinski in chat says, I'm looking forward to what ends up happening with Ingress after this divorce at Niantic.
9127459	9128060	Me too.
9128180	9132085	As somebody who's sunk a lot of hours into that game, I'm very curious.
9133186	9136410	I'm curious if they do a new client at some point.
9137071	9145436	And I'm very curious to see how they continue to integrate that with Scanaverse and their real point about trying to get people to scan areas of interest.
9145957	9151340	Because, you know, overclocking portals, which is like using their portal scan technology, is a thing in Ingress.
9151860	9153761	I think barely any players are doing it.
9154202	9155603	Barely anybody's actually doing it.
9155963	9160105	So I'm not sure if they're going to find ways to make the AR gaming more compelling.
9160886	9165309	Because I feel like that's where Niantic eventually wants to be, is trying to make more of that like...
9166585	9168906	world around you AR gaming more compelling.
9169486	9169986	But we'll see.
9170767	9176109	We have a call on our Discord channel, and I want to get to that before we wrap up tonight over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
9176369	9180450	You can join the green room and you can give us a call just like this caller is right now.
9180990	9182191	Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9182211	9182531	Who's this?
9183871	9184732	Hey, everybody.
9185623	9187044	This is the one and only Ranma.
9187164	9189386	Weren't you just here last week?
9189786	9191107	Weren't you just here last week?
9192007	9195530	Sir, you have used your once a month ticket.
9195590	9196150	No, I'm kidding.
9196190	9197371	It's always a delight to hear from you.
9197391	9198031	How are you doing, Ranma?
9198952	9200313	Oh, I'm doing good.
9200393	9201674	I just came back from Baltimore.
9201694	9202734	I just had a grand old time.
9203075	9203795	In Baltimore?
9205536	9206477	What was going on?
9206637	9208258	What's in Baltimore other than history?
9208278	9209019	Two questions.
9209459	9210740	What were you doing in Baltimore?
9211200	9215243	And did you sing the song Good Morning Baltimore from the musical Hairspray?
9216838	9218659	One, I went there to visit friends.
9219020	9221001	Two, I did not because I do not remember the words.
9221802	9222963	Oh, you only need the chorus.
9223003	9225044	Good morning, Baltimore.
9225104	9225625	That's all you need.
9226565	9233791	Rob, I just want you to know the last time I saw Hairspray, Ricky Lake was in it and I think I was like... That's the only one that exists.
9233991	9235532	We do not talk about John Travolta.
9236112	9237613	We don't.
9237633	9238814	I just make it up.
9239014	9239375	Okay.
9241376	9244939	Although the Ricky Lake version didn't have the songs, so I get it.
9246531	9248091	Anyway, what do you want to call in about tonight?
9249152	9253433	I just want to jump in on this whole switch to brouhaha, okay?
9253853	9255633	Brouhaha is a good word for it.
9256754	9260435	Because I def can verify this.
9260815	9266336	When they announced all the games and they announced the price, I said, this is such bull.
9266556	9269757	There's no way that console is worth that price.
9271116	9292030	and my reasoning is I'm a tech person I gotta see if the tech is worth the purchase I said for years the Switch is not worth the price mark because the hardware is underneath it but I also said when I do buy the Switch I'm walking out of the store with five games I walked out with six that day on Black Friday
9294045	9300308	Here's something else people often forget about Nintendo, DJ Ranma S. Nintendo will not sell their consoles at a loss.
9301349	9302749	Other gaming companies will do it.
9302809	9304130	Sony has sold at a loss.
9304490	9305230	Microsoft's done it.
9305911	9312874	Nintendo has never sold at a loss until the 3DS backed them into a corner and they had to because the 3DS was going to tank otherwise.
9313654	9315975	So, but that is, yeah, yeah.
9316015	9319457	So them overcharging versus what the hardware really is
9320177	9320958	is not a complete surprise.
9320978	9323039	I mean, I understand why it frustrates people, but it's not.
9323059	9331284	I mean, to me, the more glaring issue is the $350-ish Japanese-only one.
9332125	9333306	I'm going to get to that.
9333406	9334206	All right.
9334266	9335207	I'll shut my mouth.
9336187	9337108	It's all good, fam.
9337568	9343932	Now, I read an NVIDIA blog post about the Switch 2, about the hardware that's underneath.
9344433	9346134	I cross-referenced what I read
9346863	9349605	on a Wikipedia entry about the different Tegra processors.
9349825	9351267	And I'm looking at them like, you know what?
9353949	9355790	I can see why they're asking that much.
9356131	9360294	The hardware underneath in the console, I say, is well worth it.
9360754	9364518	And that's why I said that night, I'm going to put the preorder down.
9365058	9366219	I see that it was worth it.
9366359	9366940	It was worth it.
9368328	9373035	We hear about the tariffs, and again, you probably have seen this.
9373295	9378583	The sheer number of people that are saying, oh, Nintendo is putting out this price to cover their artists.
9379164	9380827	No, you ignorant...
9383058	9385360	Nintendo made the announcement that day.
9385560	9387041	They didn't realize what was going on.
9387261	9388722	It was a pure coincidence.
9389063	9389783	That's all it was.
9389823	9391625	I'm trying to explain this to people.
9392085	9395988	And then here we come talking about the price of the video games.
9396208	9400372	And people are talking about, oh, how Donkey Kong Country 2 was $89.99 in the U.S.
9400672	9401813	No, it was not.
9402633	9405115	It was $59.99 U.S.
9405476	9406396	How do I know this?
9407117	9407877	I was there.
9408218	9411040	Don't speak the legend to me when I was there when it was written.
9412125	9429154	and the thing is almost every site is talking about the price comparison of Super NES games and Switch 2 games are Canadian prices I was just about to say you gotta use your critical thinking because sometimes when people post those stuff it's showing what the Canadian flyers were in the day
9429574	9433397	which was back in that day.
9433417	9434858	I know it's gone back and forth and all that.
9435498	9436459	The dollars are volatile.
9436719	9443924	But in that day, you would generally expect to see $10 to $20 higher in Canada because of what the conversion was at that time.
9445225	9451390	And what people don't understand is the reason why games went so cheap because CD and DVD format.
9451830	9456394	You could buy spindles of blank media and put stuff on it.
9456694	9457575	It was all over.
9457595	9460458	That helped bring down the price of the games.
9460798	9461599	And that was great.
9461859	9465562	That was a golden age because almost everybody could afford to buy video games.
9466263	9468145	And then the prices started to come up again.
9468405	9469886	Which I understand.
9469906	9471968	You gotta pay for the servers.
9472148	9473249	You gotta pay for the tech.
9473610	9474430	And I get that.
9474931	9475732	I understand that.
9476712	9479535	Nintendo's just asking a little bit too much money out of my pocket right now.
9479955	9480996	That's the way I look at it.
9481016	9484319	I think they have crossed the line on the pricing.
9484580	9492687	And again, as Mike has said in the chat, which is something I had said somewhere else on a Facebook group, when someone's talking about inflation...
9493553	9498095	You can't compare inflation when people's salaries have not gone up.
9498975	9503618	20 years ago, when the N64 came out, I didn't pay $199.
9503998	9510621	I paid $249 because I went to a local mom and pop store that I have been loyal to for years.
9511101	9514002	And I worked my ass off and paid that off.
9514262	9515063	And that's what I did.
9516543	9519805	Nowadays, it's like, look at the price.
9520285	9521686	I will say this right now.
9521766	9522226	I don't care.
9523075	9527337	I make about $80,000 in New York City.
9528217	9533440	Do you know how long it took me to pay bills and to save up just to get a PlayStation 5?
9533580	9536701	Yeah, and some people are going to say, wow, that's a lot of money.
9537641	9542404	But for New York City, you're going to be on budget with that.
9542604	9543104	Exactly.
9544905	9546345	And I'll say this right now.
9547206	9548406	The Switch at that price?
9549807	9550287	I can do it.
9551340	9553382	After Taras, I can wait.
9553843	9559549	I will pay off the rest of my bills first, and then when the time comes, I will make that purchase.
9559829	9566376	But again, you can't see it, but behind me, on the right, is a shelf full of PlayStation 4.
9566476	9572804	for PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series games I have yet to play because I caught them on sale.
9572844	9579473	I'm like, if I don't buy it now, I'm probably not going to get my hands on it because believe you me, that Cyberpunk 2077 fire sale for $10?
9579513	9580354	Yeah, I was in on that shit.
9586490	9611990	I feel the dam that's going to burst is that Nintendo is going to have to re-approach their concept of never putting games on sale I do think there's going to be a lot of gamers that respond similarly to what Loki and I are saying that we're not going to risk $80 on a game we don't know enough about to buy that on day one To be fair, Nintendo has put games on sale
9613084	9613825	Rarely.
9614685	9616306	And it's never the ones you want.
9617646	9618007	Kinda.
9618287	9621008	Remember Player's Choice or Greatest Hits?
9621248	9626731	It was the same game with a fancy new banner around the old cover art and it was $39.99.
9627291	9630573	Sure, and Sony did the same thing for Greatest Hits and da-da-da.
9630613	9631573	Yeah, I gotcha.
9632134	9636436	I didn't notice since PlayStation 4 nobody's done that.
9637475	9640938	You know what else is interesting?
9641038	9643000	It's all the digital fire sales now.
9644401	9651867	Check out Sony's digital store any day of the week and you can find some relatively recent games for $20, but it's all the stuff that flopped at $70.
9653628	9657831	Orange right in chat says, I'm definitely not planning on canceling my Gamefly anytime soon.
9657851	9658132	You know what?
9658152	9660253	I'm almost positive I saw Bobby say a similar thing.
9660834	9666839	I wonder how that's going to... I wonder if suddenly Gamefly is really popular again.
9669034	9671075	or similar services.
9671776	9684965	Again, this goes back to what I talked about last week about renting those games at the local video store because I couldn't afford them but I did have that chance to play the game for three nights and three days and two nights and take a look at how great it was.
9685085	9692411	Can you imagine the $80 price of games bringing back game rentals in a way we haven't seen in decades?
9695001	9696022	That would be crazy.
9696042	9704509	But now that I'm sitting here, I'm like, hell yeah, I would rent the Donkey Kong game for like 10 bucks and play it for a little bit and try it out.
9704569	9705770	But they'll fight against it.
9707011	9716039	Let's just say that somehow rentals come back in the next two years and we have blockbuster videos or whatever the equivalent would be now with that, where they're renting video games.
9716719	9719802	Publishers would just be like, hey, consumers.
9720902	9747210	and we're gonna like put some stupid like a code or something like that because I mean remember they were combating like used game sales at one time they were combating rentals you literally cannot trust this game industry for anything like it's just Bobby with sorry Bobby with an excellent reminder you know libraries also lend games that's a damn good point I always forget well right now while they have the budget I mean I'm looking
9747450	9748831	I'll give you an example.
9750011	9756473	When I bought my PlayStation 4, I bought the Spider-Man 2 edition one, and I sold the Spider-Man game because it's not my cup of tea.
9756913	9760935	Some of my friends said I was crazy, but I'm like, I have a very eclectic taste in video games.
9760975	9762435	If you saw my collection, you'd understand it.
9762915	9769658	So I go to GameStop, and I trade it in for another game that they have brand new, and the guy's like, it's not my cup of tea.
9769698	9773119	He's like, what you should do is go ahead, play through the game,
9773948	9777651	return, sell it back, pick up another game, and go back and forth.
9777692	9778712	I do this all the time.
9779053	9779333	Okay.
9779553	9783617	As much as I like to cheat the system, even I have my moral standards.
9784698	9784898	Yeah.
9788001	9788261	All right.
9789142	9794887	Well, we are starting to run long for the show, so I do want to get any last thoughts for you, and then we're going to wrap up tonight.
9794967	9797530	So, Ranma, anything else you want to get out before we get out?
9799853	9810517	Next time we do a world release date, if the title kind of sounds like this is a fucking anime, 99% of the time, it generally is.
9811817	9812057	It is.
9812317	9816599	And I will probably be like, oh, I've heard of this one, oh, I haven't played it yet, and so forth.
9816839	9824401	And I would know more animes if I listened every week to Anime Jam Session, although I do try to make it a point to tune in, but sometimes the talk's a little over my head.
9824421	9826302	I'm actually starting an anime.
9827512	9831233	I'm going to watch Tokyo Ghoul since we got the character in Dead by Daylight.
9831273	9832253	There you go.
9832533	9834754	And for you, Rob, I recommend watching Cowboy Bebop.
9834914	9835654	You love it.
9835874	9836074	Nah.
9836534	9837614	Watch Sakamoto Days.
9838474	9838734	Yes.
9839055	9839275	Yes.
9840235	9840715	Right?
9841055	9842615	I almost got the cosplay for that.
9842835	9843576	I almost did.
9843596	9844716	I almost pulled the trigger on it.
9844996	9847336	That is so fucking good.
9847376	9849837	My husband would prefer I watch Sailor Moon, but okay.
9853038	9857159	Rob, if you still have a functional DVD player, I have an entire box set of Cowboy Bebop.
9857340	9858360	I have a Wii.
9858640	9859400	They play DVDs.
9861141	9864402	Alright, Ranma, my friend, I'm going to let you go, but have fun on Anime Jam Session.
9864443	9865523	We will talk to you very soon.
9866443	9867384	You guys, take care, y'all.
9867404	9867664	Bye!
9869265	9872966	Alright, well, with that, quickly, Loki, do we have any last-minute stories tonight?
9873886	9874407	Yeah.
9874827	9876127	Yeah, unfortunately we do.
9876708	9878588	We've got word that...
9880950	9882311	Poor, poor Bellaltro.
9883131	9884812	They can't get a break.
9884832	9894837	So you remember they were getting age-restricted on some of the storefronts because of gambling concerns or whatever, and then that kind of got ironed out.
9895257	9905703	Well, now, good old YouTube and their changing of their terms of service are now cracking down on depictions or promotions of online casino sites or apps.
9906403	9908626	It'll cause your stuff to be age-restricted.
9908666	9915112	And unfortunately, they're false-flagging the Bellatro content because it has poker mechanics, but it's not necessarily gambling.
9915132	9919837	And I will fucking bet, dimed a dollar, it's a fucking AI thing that's false-flagging it.
9919857	9920098	Of course.
9921010	9949208	of course, so unfortunately it's an issue right now local thunk, the creator of the game said on social media good thing we're protecting children from knowing what a four of a kind is and letting them watch CSGO case opening videos instead I mean, because that's not being struck down by this thing, so yeah, it's frustrating to say the least alright, anything else?
9951065	9962970	um I just to mention you was it I think we talked about it before Minecraft movie 157 million dollars in the box office opening uh record-breaking beating out Mario Brothers congratulations
9964124	9964424	All right.
9964924	9966444	We're going to get to final thoughts real quick.

9992910	9994911	goes an awful long way and thank you very much.
9995271	9996052	Take a breath, Rob.
9996392	9996932	I can't.
9996952	9998093	I'm trying to get it done.
9998373	9999513	You are speeding.
9999953	10001754	You know me.
10002215	10004256	And if it's not micromachines, it's not the real thing.
10005576	10006197	DarkSakura.
10006377	10007117	Rob Machida.
10007757	10008798	Are you going to stream tonight?
10010459	10014941	Yeah, I won't have a lot of time for it, but I'll do some killer matches tonight.
10015101	10016241	Just get a little bit in.
10016281	10017342	So yeah, I'll do it.
10017462	10019103	I'm kind of already logged in.
10020003	10021344	Final thoughts for our listeners.
10022505	10025366	My final thought is no one will replace the pig in my heart.
10026546	10026866	All right.
10027306	10027827	Have a good stream.
10027847	10028427	We'll see you in a minute.
10029647	10030908	See ya.
10030968	10031968	Loki, that takes us to you.
10032008	10032808	Your final thought tonight.
10034789	10038290	Final thought is work tomorrow.
10041430	10043571	God, I don't want to hear the news this week.
10044271	10045212	It's only going to get worse.
10045292	10046712	I know, I know, but...
10048018	10050699	All those checks and balances that refuse to check and balance...
10068442	10069082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10088871	10104098	But I want to give a shout out to my pals over at the show Video Game Realness, which stars four wonderful guys out of Canada that do this show, including a buddy and a longtime supporter of this show, Delvin, who has been on the show at some point.
10104138	10106379	I know he was here in person like years ago before the pandemic.
10107560	10108340	Check out the show.
10108420	10109501	They're on YouTube now.
10109541	10111322	So they're actually doing like a YouTube show.
10111682	10114663	And they just came back with their Switch 2 reaction show.
10115424	10116124	So check that out.
10116264	10117545	And my understanding is...
10118405	10121246	They may not be the only ones staging a comeback.
10121687	10125548	So it's like 2014 in the podcast-iverse right now.
10125568	10126529	And it feels great.
10127309	10128910	So check out my pals over there, won't you?
10130151	10130491	That's it.
10130531	10131291	That's going to do it for me.
10131371	10132252	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
10132272	10133492	We'll see you in seven days.
10134253	10136234	And who knows what's going to get fucked by then.
10136374	10137514	So let's stay.
10138495	10140035	The possibilities are endless.
10140055	10141056	Stay positive.
10143937	10144818	We'll see you next time.
10144958	10145258	Bye.
