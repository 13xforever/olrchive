10146	11586	Writing is hard, I know this.
11726	17987	I'm not a writer outside of these intros, but the sub-headline for our lead story written by a video games writer or editor was a big miss.
18167	22008	The Mario Maker is stuck between a thwomp and a green shell when it comes to the current tariff mess.
22188	24329	So close, yet so far, blue shell!
24549	29830	One could argue green because money, but green shells don't instill fear in Mario Kart racers like the blue shell does.
30090	31130	Guess which story is the lead?
31270	35891	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
36071	38051	Start your night now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
40185	44506	Jason, it's a red shell if you look at the stock market right now.
47047	47387	Oh, hi.
47628	50188	Welcome back to another episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
50288	52149	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
52209	59652	We are live once again tonight, April the 13th of 2025 with episode number 1042 of our show.
60152	63653	My name is Rob Roberts and with me as always, Tech Master Loki.
63673	65333	Hello.
65514	65934	Hi, Loki.
65954	66514	How are you doing?
67691	67911	All right.
68171	68551	All right.
68652	70452	I love the Ninja Turtles in the background.
70512	77236	This this has to be the recent game because I noticed April and Splinter in there, which was not the old arcade game.
78616	79117	That's true.
79137	79637	That's true.
79817	80937	Shredder's Revenge was fun, though.
80978	85260	I did play that at some party not that long ago and finally got around to playing it.
85300	95144	And it's it's definitely reminiscent of, you know, being a roundtable pizza, putting quarters in that old ass coin machine with April O'Neill on the side in the very 90s hair.
95384	96165	It's incredible.
96887	102208	It's so funny because there's a lot of these games that are trying to be homage to the arcade.
102788	104569	Can we get arcade versions of them?
104649	111931	Like Scott Pilgrim Saves the World or whatever versus the world would be a great one to see as an arcade beat-em-up.
113331	116392	Pretty much anything by Tribute is...
118112	123854	Great fodder for arcade ports like this, for example, should be an arcade port.
123974	131137	I mean, looking at DarkSakura's segment, which by the way, not joining us tonight, unfortunately, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, they're a little under the weather.
132138	137500	Had a 14-hour marathon stream yesterday, I think, as a little bit of an early birthday.
137600	145523	So happy early birthday to DarkSakura, but she wasn't feeling too great earlier and I think had to miss some of her other commitments and I don't know if that's
147104	150506	Stamina or Stamina combined with other things going on.
150526	157671	But whatever the case may be, I hope DarkSakura feels much better and will join us again next week just in time for her.
157711	159352	No, just after her birthday, actually.
159772	161173	But we'll still get to say hello.
161273	163975	So DarkSakura will be back with us next week.
164315	165056	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
187623	195309	Hello to you all in chat as well, including Questbuster, who says Tribute Games, who did Shredder's Revenge, is also doing Cosmic Invasion.
195629	196770	So I'm hyped about that, too.
196870	207417	By the way, if you want to join the chat, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
207777	224219	by the way some housekeeping I want to get here done at the top regarding the Voice of Geeks Network and our shows you know unfortunately during COVID and you know some of the the ramp up to that we we lost a good chunk of our lineup here at VOG Network but I'm very excited to announce one of the shows that some
224799	226039	You may have thought it's sunsetted.
226520	227120	Has not.
228100	231401	And is back after a multi-year hiatus.
232202	237803	Big shout out to our friends over at Gamebuoy.org, a video game podcast.
238324	244246	Loki, this is every time I say Gamebuoy.org, this is where you have to say in a very high-pitched voice, Gamebuoy.org, a video game podcast.
245146	246906	Just like Slidekick does on the show.
247207	248127	So let's try that again.
248827	251188	Welcome back to the Gamebuoy.org podcast.
253249	253970	Alright, bye.
256854	257775	Alright, then you say it.
257835	258736	You say welcome back.
258776	259177	You do it.
260619	262721	Welcome back to GameBooey.org.
263141	263801	GameBooey.org.
264522	265282	Yes, you got it.
265342	265582	All right.
266643	268144	Yeah, so a big welcome back to them.
268164	269445	They just put out a new episode.
270626	273928	The Switch 2 is making people come out of hiding.
274088	283334	Another podcast that I always really loved with one of our listeners that's frequently on our show, Delvin, heads up Video Game Realness.
283374	286857	And I mentioned at the end of the last show, they came back for a reunion episode too.
286877	287497	There's four episodes.
287617	288758	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
309958	310258	All right.
310559	319922	You can get all the latest information about Gameboy.org and their links and all that good stuff over at the Voice Geeks Network or on their own website, which I think you would know by now as Gameboy.org.
320682	333547	And they're available on all the major podcast platforms as well as the links over at VOGnetwork.com and in our Discord server that pushes all those updates, but not with a ping because we know the ping is annoying.
333587	335367	So we have an optional channel that you can just watch.
335868	335988	It's...
337248	339989	VOG Network.com slash Discord.
340709	353153	Well, since we're talking about Switch 2 and, you know, all the podcasts coming back to celebrate the Switch 2, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which is, of course, is going to be a follow-up to everything last week.
353193	360335	Because, Loki, do you remember at the end of last week's show, we said something to the effect of, you know what, in seven more days...
361155	363616	This is going to flip-flop a hundred times.
363736	367677	We're still not going to have the answers as to how much this thing is going to cost.
367817	368597	And guess what?
368977	369797	Guess what, Mimi?
370238	370658	They did.
371098	374139	Because it still can't figure it out what's happening.
374159	374859	It's still going.
374919	376819	Even today, there's stuff switching up.
378520	380900	And now, I know you got a story on this, too.
381000	382701	Now we're getting Canada into it.
384201	387222	God, we've been picking on them unnecessarily.
387262	389743	I'm so sorry to our Canadian friends who are listening.
389763	389903	Yeah.
390663	392825	I ate some all-dressed chips today, Your Honor.
394427	405279	There's like no plan, and you have someone with dementia making the plans, and so that's why the plans are all over the place, and nobody's on the same page about anything, and it keeps changing.
405339	408262	Wow!
409283	411986	It wasn't spill that tea, it was choke on my coffee.
412226	412727	Dang, Loki.
413902	417225	Well, yeah, I mean, because it's just confusing enough.
417345	421088	And you have to figure also, too, with all these changes in tariffs.
421508	426252	So companies, like corporations, the ones that you're either...
427369	428290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
445425	454011	You know, their production or like somehow get product from China to Taiwan to then import from there.
454351	458934	The problem is with the tariff numbers changing constantly, you can't make a plan.
459234	468180	And it's also like, you know, the whole point of bringing, you know, putting tariffs out there was to try to bring more manufacturing to the United States.
468701	474765	But that doesn't just happen like with a Thanos snap and then all of a sudden there's like factories and workers and everything.
475725	476786	10 years to set that up.
478067	478948	It's dumb.
479348	489956	But anyways, so yes, the good news is that it's possible that... Now we don't... Computers are exempt from tariffs is the latest flavor of the month.
489976	490837	No, no, no, no, no.
490997	491777	But does that include Switch?
491817	492298	No, they're not.
493551	495211	No, they're not exempt.
495251	495892	That's the thing.
496272	498472	I told you it's changing already.
498812	501273	I clearly consulted with Ms.
501293	503853	Cleo incorrectly on what the fuck he was thinking.
504033	505054	Excuse me.
505574	506094	Yeah, yeah.
506334	513516	So, like, yes, it's nice to think that they might be, but then that was reversed again today.
514516	519297	Apparently, they've walked back tariff exemptions on electronics.
520134	543944	so you know even though they said that that was going to be the case it says they've walked it back now and there's supposed to be more news coming on Monday you know for for them to this uh tank the stock market and then change course and then boost the stock market again because it's a big rug pull you know uh bait and switch nonsense with the stock market now because we can do that is he gonna name a day after it is it gonna be you know Tara what
544304	547105	We're going to celebrate Tariff Clarity Day.
547385	548686	It's going to be a huge day.
549006	550446	Huge day full of clarity.
551307	552647	It's going to be celebrated.
554448	557009	Huge, wonderful things are going to happen.
557929	563432	We are aware that he is a moron and the whole administration is stupid and everything is just on fire.
563992	567153	It is literally the Emperor wears new clothes.
567253	569094	It is literally the Emperor wears new clothes.
569674	581440	Literally we have the whole medical report that was released that they do every year and they're telling us that God King is the healthiest human being on the face of the earth and also has won golf tournaments.
581660	583360	That was on his medical report for some reason.
583400	584381	His BMI is 28.
585854	591719	Yeah, he's just like, you know, he's so smart and the best of everything.
592079	603328	I know there is someone who likes him, hate listening to this podcast right now because, you know, social media loves to push things, and just wishing we would shut the fuck up about politics already.
603369	604429	But guess what, y'all?
604890	605750	The problem is...
606471	607412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
628649	629369	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
649670	668185	So right now it shows there's some reports saying that data showing the exports of game systems from Vietnam right now, apparently they've been stockpiling units in the United States, probably planning for these tariffs to happen eventually.
668265	673089	So get them over here before they're affected by the tariffs, and then that way you have...
673709	680714	Product to sell that you can still sell at a somewhat low enough price without having to lose money on those systems.
680834	686717	So the rumor is right now that they've stockpiled at least like a million systems over here in the United States.
687278	688118	But who knows?
688318	692761	And I mean, who knows what's actually going to be tariff wise because it's kind of gone back and forth.
692781	697964	They've already halted pre-orders on the system, which were originally going to launch on the 9th.
698945	700806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
724013	726916	Canada's had their pre-orders halted as well.
727616	728677	I'm sorry, Besties.
728837	729278	I'm sorry.
731440	732301	We tried, y'all.
732781	733221	We tried.
734162	735924	In California, we tried.
735964	749816	The launch date is still June 5th, but right now, pre-orders haven't begun yet because I don't know what that's going to look like exporting to Canada from maybe the United States or what the case may be.
750197	750657	I would
750657	752459	I'm not really sure what's going to happen there.
772618	784022	Until very recently, it was quite fucking normal for trucks to take things from harbors in other countries and take them into Mexico and Canada without fucking major issue.
784182	794545	But now, you know, everything is subject to what side of the bed a certain person wakes up on or what a certain news channel he happens to be watching says.
795086	795506	Like, that's...
796366	797287	The World We Live In Now
814901	828588	and QuestBusters pointing out board game makers and those using crowdfunding have been writing grim accounts ranging from delaying product to pivoting to things like card games just to stay afloat because they just have no idea what the bones will say the next day.
829411	830351	I like that, the bones.
830471	849216	I mean, considering what their opinion is and a lot of the opinion of the administration is with this whole masculinity in the United States, because everybody, they all think that the men in the United States should be working in factories and that they're more happy working a manual labor job.
849476	854417	Of course they're going to say that because they deported all the people that were working those fields and everything.
855478	857519	And now they want to bring back, was it coal jobs?
857800	859301	Literally, like, move us back.
859441	866665	Like, just, hey, we could, you know, become a leader in business and trade and all this stuff and really cutting edge stuff.
866705	868086	But no, let's make coal.
868667	870528	Let's power AI with coal.
872009	872789	So that's great.
872869	878793	Don't get me started on the AI thing, because this will become a political podcast if I go down that road, because that's a whole other...
880512	881393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
897242	898203	DigitalTrends.com
912840	914402	The Confusion Around $90 Switch 2 Games
937062	937882	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
963849	988489	um yeah there's still some issues though price wise like and I understand that $90 isn't the price point the other thing I've been seeing going around lately um also as a clickbait kind of headline saying there's you know $90 for uh for a game that's essentially eight years old which was The Legend of Zelda sure um you know and uh Tears of the Kingdom and um
989758	991280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1009798	1017600	Which then, you know, they say, well, to get the full experience, which is what you should be getting eight years down the road.
1017640	1019260	Yeah, they should probably throw that in there.
1020581	1021281	It's an additional $20.
1021541	1028623	So that's how they get up to $90 for what is essentially an older Zelda game that is...
1029967	1031408	mildly better on the Switch too.
1031688	1048517	To be fair, Loki, I understand that there's a certain expectation in this gaming industry that after so many years you get that game of the year edition that has everything, or especially when it comes to a new console, the game that has everything all in one that comes out for usually a lower price.
1049337	1057682	And I know there's Nintendo fanboys out there that'll defend them to the death and defend even this too, but I've got to ask y'all a very difficult question.
1058582	1063889	If I replaced the words Breath of the Wild with Elder Scrolls Skyrim...
1065322	1091403	Which absolutely is going to get a Switch 2 release Don't fucking kid yourself Absolutely will get a Switch 2 release But the difference will be Skyrim will come with all of that DLC and everything Maybe it'll be $70, but at least it'll have everything God, they're foolish if they do it, but they might And at least we know it'll go on sale relatively quick But if I were to say Skyrim instead of Breath of the Wild Would you defend it just as much?
1093221	1094762	Skyrim is also a great game.
1095602	1097383	And we don't have to compare apples to oranges.
1097443	1101664	We can acknowledge that both Skyrim and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild are great games.
1101964	1103285	Would you defend Bethesda?
1103865	1108867	Would you defend Microsoft if Skyrim were to release this for $70 with no DLC?
1111408	1117330	SSJ100Mats asks, is the DLC included with the Expansion Plus DLC?
1118402	1119563	Or is that unknown as well?
1119903	1129892	Yes, the DLC is available because the Switch 1 DLC was available through the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass.
1132094	1140261	Sure, yeah, they're going to try to get you to buy that and get the additional DLCs and everything, but like...
1141400	1142381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1158894	1188654	essentially they've made their money off it that's why Skyrim includes all of its DLC with the game because it's made its money off of that game for years now and now that I think about it they already announced a third party front Street Fighter 6 was already announced to have all the season one stuff included basically like the game will catch everybody up to where Street Fighter 6 is at with all its DLC which is how you know that's going to be a $70 release because it's going to have everything in it but Street Fighter 6 for the Switch 2 will have
1189035	1190540	Kind of all the ketchup stuff in it.
1190841	1193369	They're not done with Street Fighter 6 yet, so there will be more, but...
1194313	1203281	I mean, and if you look at, too, like, even with some of the other Switch 1 games that are getting a Switch 2 version, essentially, they're adding stuff to those.
1203321	1206023	They're not just doing, like, the graphical updates as well.
1206344	1208145	They're adding content to the games.
1208205	1211908	Like, the whole stuff with Mario Party was getting a whole new section of the game.
1212369	1214611	With, I'm trying to think what the other one was.
1214711	1216612	I think, was it Kirby or something like that?
1216732	1220215	Was getting, like, more DLC or more, like, stuff to go along with it.
1221036	1224199	Zelda is getting slightly better visuals and it'll probably run a little bit smoother.
1224279	1230005	Like, it's not... I guess you can download... I don't know if it's part of the app or not.
1230025	1235230	The iPhone, excuse me, the phone, mobile phone, Android iPhone app, the little map on your phone.
1235250	1236171	That's not part of it, though.
1236912	1238853	No, that was something they were... That's not part of the expansion.
1238873	1240955	That's just a thing that they're gonna make.
1241896	1244179	Oh, I thought that was part of the Switch 2 specific version.
1245273	1245953	No, I don't think so.
1247454	1251416	Maybe it is as far as tracking stuff, but once again, that's not included with it.
1251556	1260060	It is just a separate... I guess my drag name is Misinformation, and I'm part of the problem, because again, we don't really have clarity on a lot of this.
1261960	1262681	Yeah, I don't know.
1262821	1271545	I just... I don't like the idea of that, but then again, I already have these games, so it's like a $10 upgrade if I'm going to do those.
1272025	1272105	Um...
1272967	1273308	I don't know.
1283444	1284765	I mean, I guess... At least for Zelda.
1284805	1285725	At least for Zelda.
1286026	1286446	Yeah, I know.
1286586	1292290	It's nice, but it's... Yeah, how far... It's gonna be interesting to see what the long-term plan on that whole thing is.
1292370	1298314	But again, we need the system to come out at a reasonable price first before I think any of these bridges can be crossed.
1298334	1302816	Because I'm telling you, if they release that system more than $500, I'm not getting one.
1303857	1306639	I'm just gonna wait this whole stupid tariff thing out.
1308980	1309241	Anyway...
1310322	1311763	Yeah.
1311823	1312183	Let's see.
1312363	1315224	SJ100Matt says, it's annoying that they've known what the console looks like.
1315244	1319745	They've made the console and stockpiled it for months, but these easy details are annoyingly absent.
1319945	1326428	I give them some credit that the price stuff is really hard to figure out because there has to be the sustainability.
1326488	1329869	Sure, they have them stockpiled, but they need to sustain throughout the holidays.
1330510	1331331	It's ironic.
1331351	1333033	I think I might have said something like this last week.
1333093	1339401	It's a little bit ironic that Nintendo is known for their gigantic hardware supply issues and have been for a long time.
1340002	1344188	They're actually trying to do something about it with Switch 2 and they might get screwed anyway.
1345526	1349727	That, like, once those stockpiles and the warehouses are gone, there's not going to be any more for a bit.
1350107	1350748	Unless, I don't know.
1350768	1352468	It's just how the world we live in, I guess.
1352588	1360471	Now, speaking of stockpiling, I heard a rumor, and I don't know if it's true or not, I heard a rumor that Apple to get around, because again, I...
1361551	1390983	at least until there's the on again off again with technology but at least what I had heard before the off switch was pulled then back to on what I had heard was that they were going to move a bunch of phones from China to India where they have a presence and then move them from India to the US and I don't know like again I don't know the 4D chess with that if that's actually something they can do or how that works yeah they can that's what I heard they were doing with phones is they were moving them to India first
1391570	1401441	Right, and that's why there's a lot of companies out there that are trying to figure out what their move is as far as moving product around the world and importing it from a different place to circumvent higher stuff.
1401941	1411371	The problem is, if they keep changing all of this, especially if the administration hears that, oh yeah, they're not in good favor with Apple, which...
1411972	1412413	They're not.
1412573	1421280	I mean, they are in good favor with them, because I think that Tim Cook was one of the people he invited to the inauguration stuff and donated money.
1421701	1430329	Whatever the case may be, let's just say that somehow he pisses them off, and they want to get around, you know, they want to get back at him.
1430429	1435033	Then they'll just increase the tariffs on India for...
1435894	1436434	No reason.
1436794	1438195	Just because they feel like it.
1439335	1440896	Congress could end this tomorrow.
1441556	1442276	I just want to put that out.
1442296	1443616	Congress could end this tomorrow.
1443696	1450659	They could severely hamper the ability because the whole thing is being made on these emergency declarations that are questionable at best.
1450999	1454180	And Congress could end that emergency declaration tomorrow.
1454940	1455400	But they won't.
1457561	1460103	Yeah, the chat says that Congress doesn't have the balls.
1461124	1460103	100%.
1461264	1469009	But some in the Senate are starting to waver a little bit, which I think is why the off switch got pulled in the first place.
1469710	1472892	So there's, you know, keep those phone calls up.
1472972	1480657	Keep that, you know, directed town hall anger up because at least in the Senate, it's starting to get heard.
1480897	1481898	There was pressure there.
1481998	1484400	They were getting close to that 60 votes they need to break a...
1486201	1488382	Filibuster and all that.
1489562	1490042	We'll see.
1492323	1494343	Anything else to say about the Switch 2 tariffs today?
1494883	1497924	Which will change by the time people hear this podcast.
1497944	1498844	It'll change tomorrow.
1499524	1512928	It'll be changing tomorrow because originally it was that allegedly Tim Cook or somebody had talked to the administration and said, hey, we need an exemption on these electronics because this is going to be ridiculous for a lot of the stuff that we're doing.
1513948	1514168	And
1515268	1518630	And then that made the Trump administration look kind of weak.
1518930	1522012	And then, of course, they're like, wait a second, no, we can't look weak.
1522552	1525414	We never said we're going to stop doing that.
1525654	1526595	I don't know.
1527155	1528396	It's so hard to follow.
1528456	1533319	And I think that's intentional because they're doing other horrible things at the same time.
1533379	1544305	It's just like 4D horrible chess with human rights violations and all sorts of gutting everything and just literally making a mess of everything.
1546832	1554499	Anyhow, we'll be back in seven days to talk about the latest to see if Nintendo wants to commit to a pre-order date or not.
1554579	1558462	And quite frankly, I don't blame them until there's a lot more clarity on this whole thing.
1558702	1560043	So we'll see.
1561605	1567370	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week, Switch or otherwise.
1567450	1568471	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1569749	1570229	It was fine.
1570269	1571510	I just, you know, Minecraft.
1572811	1574892	Playing lots of Minecraft.
1574952	1576472	We had a stream day on Saturday.
1576953	1578773	So I streamed for a couple hours then.
1578813	1580134	So that was pretty fun.
1580454	1582575	And just put out another episode.
1582635	1584516	So now I have five weeks in a row now.
1584596	1588018	Probably will have six here pretty soon because I have enough footage for another episode again.
1589178	1593120	And yeah, just working on the SMP stuff.
1593140	1596882	Still chucking away at my industrial district that is...
1598298	1600160	Pretty close to done, I think.
1600680	1602722	There's not a lot more I can really build.
1603163	1609929	And then I'm going to have to start actually getting to building the big game that's this season.
1610889	1623981	And yeah, other than that Bellaltro bit, I did end up ordering... I'm not really into this scene too much, but there's all these Android retro game handhelds.
1624361	1636092	It's basically emulation portable systems that run a bunch of these things, emulate everything from as old as you can think to... I think this one does up to...
1637179	1653584	PlayStation 2 it even does some Switch and like Wii and stuff like that it doesn't really go beyond that you can do like PlayStation 3 sort of and some of the Xbox stuff if you switch it over to Linux but I got a I ordered a Retro Pocket 3
1655029	1658412	Lip 2, which is a really nice Android device.
1658493	1661055	It's got an OLED screen on it and stuff.
1662096	1664719	It's like a clamshell, almost like a 3DS or something like that.
1665279	1670784	So I'm going to try to load that up with a bunch of games and do that, because honestly...
1673356	1694077	I keep buying like retro games for my Nintendo and I'm just I'm never gonna play them because I have to hook that all up and everything and so this is just easier for me plus you can get all the like botted games that people make and stuff and I think it'd be fun for my son to play and all that type of thing nice plus screw Nintendo I'm gonna emulate whatever the fuck I want
1696169	1699010	Ironically, I was playing with Nintendo emulators this week, too.
1699070	1699490	I was playing.
1700071	1703272	I played DuckTales, the classic NES version for no particular reason.
1703332	1704032	I just want to play it.
1704192	1705673	I mean, why do you need a reason to play that game?
1705733	1706653	It's one of the best.
1707153	1708574	So I was playing that a little bit.
1708954	1710035	So good times.
1710155	1713156	Anyway, before I take over anything else for your game week, Loki.
1714828	1715389	No, that was it.
1716530	1720373	Then continuing on with my gaming week, I've been playing a little more Final Fantasy XIV.
1720393	1726358	I finally unlocked that dungeon in the patch after two and a half weeks, which would tell you kind of where my head is at with that game right now.
1726418	1730442	It's just I haven't really been as into it as weeks past.
1731102	1734285	I guess I have a new Diablo 4 patch to look forward to, though, in a few weeks.
1734405	1737007	Although some of the hardcore people really don't care for that patch either.
1737448	1738208	So I don't know.
1738228	1738568	We'll see.
1738609	1739409	We'll see what happens there.
1739509	1740030	But yeah.
1740390	1740810	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1760186	1761667	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1783766	1784727	It's incredible.
1784887	1785507	Oh my god.
1785968	1790651	Yeah, so four of us were actually playing all at the same time, and it felt great to play that game again.
1790951	1792572	We were playing some other GameCube games too.
1793372	1794873	This may surprise you.
1795034	1799056	I had never played, somehow, never played Kirby Air Ride before.
1799637	1810424	So when the sequel was announced last week, I didn't have a lot to say about it, but I actually got to play the GameCube version of that game this last week, and I was like, oh...
1811044	1811625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1826824	1834106	I actually played this vehicle in the game that like every time you hit the A button, you actually fully stopped.
1834466	1837447	And then you had to like aim yourself and you go back up to full speed.
1837487	1840888	It was kind of neat, like a little slingshot kind of way to play.
1840988	1842328	But yeah, I enjoyed Air Ride.
1842368	1847070	And again, runs so good with four people playing all at the same time.
1847190	1850391	Like you don't notice the frame drops or anything like that.
1851411	1854652	Man, the GameCube was really underrated, I think, but...
1855632	1856133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1874724	1876285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1899700	1929020	and I wanted to say I don't want to say too much about it but one of them is in game dev and I wanted to be like oh you should check this game out because I think this is fucking brilliant and like you know it deserves to be bigger than it is and he played it and he said yeah this is really this is really fun this is a really funny or like not funny but like really like engaging type of concept so um it was good to get that validation by the way speaking of game devs another random thing I did this week I actually went to a game dev meetup on Thursday and I wasn't sure if I was going to go my friend invited me
1929720	1931181	and I was like, well, should I go?
1931221	1947671	I'm not really a game dev but they actually were quite welcoming and it was nice to... It also is very nice to be able to say, oh yeah, I'm in Guinness Book of Video Gaming Records because that kind of buys you like the I'm different from the other podcasts like right out the gate type of thing.
1948131	1951313	But I mean, everybody was really cool welcoming and it was really nice to just kind of hear.
1951733	1957336	I actually would encourage anybody who does like podcasts or commenting on the gaming industry to...
1958277	1958357	Yeah.
1958377	1958477	Yeah.
1980814	1981955	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2002407	2015220	and how devs are sort of navigating that whole ethicalness of, I don't really want to use AI to create assets, but how might I use AI to sort of like inspire assets sort of thing.
2015500	2017722	It's a very fascinating conversation to sort of listen to.
2018343	2021486	And believe it or not, once in my life, I mostly shut up and listened.
2021546	2023748	And it was very, very interesting.
2023828	2026370	So yeah, I would recommend anybody who is into game dev,
2027571	2034155	or into games and commenting on them, like check out your local game dev scene and hear things from another perspective.
2034795	2042559	Don't hear things just from X or Blue Sky or Facebook or whatever social media you tend to use.
2043019	2045480	Don't just get your gaming perspectives from that.
2045960	2047641	Like get it from a variety of places.
2047701	2049862	It's very interesting and can be eye-opening.
2050343	2050783	So there was that.
2052901	2077002	I think that's it for really the games I want to talk about this week but I do have one other thing I want to share and I had to mention it at some point tonight but Alan and I adopted a new kitty so there it is on the screen and for those in the podcast feed I'm showing this very light orange kitty and his name is Oreo and you might be wondering why would you name an orange cat
2077302	2077582	Oreo.
2077602	2087527	He's a very scared boy in that picture because he literally had just been let out in the walk-in closet where he's living right now for a couple days while him and Cheddar get acclimated to each other.
2088127	2090389	And it's a walk-in closet, so don't worry.
2090429	2091169	He has a lot of space.
2091649	2094951	But you might be wondering, why did I name an orange cat?
2095151	2096091	Actually, it was Alan's idea.
2096752	2097872	Name an orange cat Oreo.
2098553	2100954	And that's because we have a black and white cat named Cheddar.
2102179	2102799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2122225	2123507	are a little more light.
2123567	2130113	Or I was thinking Halloween Oreos have the orange cream, but golden Oreos are a little closer to what Oreo the cat looks like.
2130213	2131895	So I think it works for me.
2132015	2133357	So more updates to come.
2133417	2139443	He's still in the walk-in closet, but Alan's talking about maybe letting him and Cheddar mingle tomorrow.
2139543	2140504	So we'll see how that goes.
2141525	2143627	But we're really excited about that on the cat front.
2145277	2149360	He's eight years old, by the way, so he's already a little bit older, which is around where Cheddar's age is at.
2149400	2154144	You know, senior cats are a little harder to find homes for, so we're happy to take senior cats in.
2154905	2156306	He's just, he's a really nice boy.
2156526	2167395	He's very, he really, really, you know, at first when we went to the house that he was kind of temporarily staying at while they were looking for a home, he was very, like, he ran away.
2167675	2169336	He fucking hid behind the fridge.
2170177	2170498	and DarkSakura.
2187060	2190604	Let him know he has a new home and he's very loving now and he doesn't try to hide.
2190644	2193687	But I imagine when we open the door and he can explore, he'll find a new place to hide.
2194207	2195348	But he has to eat eventually.
2197250	2197530	All right.
2198051	2200493	Anyway, let's move on with some more...
2201564	2203186	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2220863	2249152	and I am curious to see how that turns out even though I'm not like huge on the games as other people are and that's not a knock on them I'm just not usually a big zombie person but I understand that the game is pretty good and at some point I'll go back through them but apparently you know the show is really good and so season two I know a lot of people are excited for and Catherine O'Hara is in it so like how could it possibly be bad to be quite honest and
2249893	2263654	um let's see uh Mike Deft also suggests Spring Break could be a part of you know and it's fine it is what it is look look if we wanted to have a thousand viewers we would just be more outraged clickbait
2264881	2265801	We could do that.
2265921	2267562	We could do more outrage clickbait.
2268222	2270523	But I don't want to be that guy.
2271104	2271984	I don't want to be that guy.
2272104	2273885	I like the small little group we have here.
2274265	2277286	We have an intelligent group of viewers and listeners on the podcast feed.
2278007	2279247	And I'm very happy for that.
2279708	2283249	And, you know, being famous is probably overrated.
2285870	2286130	All right.
2286470	2286931	Sorry, Loki.
2286951	2287711	We can get back to the news.
2288311	2294254	Yeah, so Nintendo has confirmed that their Switch 2 is not going to have achievements.
2296138	2296798	That's too bad.
2297039	2308285	But we have to remember that the world of Nintendo exists in a bubble that is several years behind the curve when it comes to certain niceties.
2308385	2315469	I mean, they just got video chat, so obviously we're going to have to wait a little bit for maybe achievements.
2315830	2317531	Maybe the Switch 3 will have achievements.
2318759	2320540	It is kind of silly, though.
2320600	2324602	No, I think Nintendo doesn't see the value added in achievements.
2324682	2329885	Nintendo doesn't see how achievements are fun, and that's why they don't want to do it, which I think is a bummer.
2330005	2338750	I've seen some of the discourse on Blue Sky and social media that are like, good, I don't want achievements in the game because I don't want to have to feel like I have to chase these things down.
2338770	2340731	And it's like, nobody's fucking forcing you.
2341571	2343492	Well, yeah, and they do already have...
2345033	2347374	Yeah, and they have this stuff already in games.
2347434	2354055	I mean, we saw already with Mario Kart World that they have some sort of achievement system within that game.
2354135	2358196	So it's not like that games can't just do that.
2358296	2366138	But it is weird, though, that they don't have that type of thing in there anyways, because it is kind of on all the other platforms already.
2367355	2369177	I think it's such a missed opportunity.
2369317	2372139	I think it's such a missed opportunity with the retro catalog too.
2374061	2377223	You don't even have to do it like normal achievement.
2378064	2382148	Nintendo, if you want to make achievements fun, think about the concept differently.
2382908	2392453	What if you had... Again, I'm putting this out there, but I just don't see Nintendo going this direction or innovating this much in this department, quite frankly.
2392493	2397856	I think a lot of people are concerned about chasing points or chasing trophy levels.
2398256	2399277	What if it wasn't that?
2399377	2406241	What if it was like you have a virtual binder, a social media thing, a virtual social media profile where you earn stickers?
2406821	2407382	It should be.
2407402	2408002	That sounds amazing.
2408103	2408463	It should be.
2421837	2422938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2449279	2454482	DarkSakura says, well, Nintendo kind of does the profile picture thing from playing certain NSO games already.
2454583	2455343	Kind of.
2455363	2461207	You still have to pay the coins for a lot of them, you know, and it's not really tied to like, I don't know, it should, it should.
2462768	2465269	It should just be something a little extra and fun.
2465349	2466750	That's all achievements need to be.
2467170	2472853	And again, there should be lots of stickers available for just doing other things.
2472953	2475634	Like, you bought a game.
2475794	2476514	Here's a sticker.
2476694	2479836	You turned on your Switch every day for a week.
2479896	2480536	Here's a sticker.
2480976	2483017	You added a friend to your friends list.
2483057	2483798	Here's a sticker.
2483818	2491021	There could be a lot of these things that don't necessarily have to be tied to game achievements so that people can feel like...
2491981	2494322	They're still participating even when they don't want to participate.
2494402	2494982	I love the idea.
2495002	2497502	You open the settings menu 500 times.
2498883	2499723	Okay, maybe not that.
2499783	2500263	Maybe not that.
2500303	2508445	But just things that are very common and just, I don't know, encourage the other features of the system.
2508925	2515266	Usually in every Xbox or PlayStation game, there is a gimme trophy.
2516633	2521438	for beating the tutorial, for beating stage one, for getting a power up.
2521918	2525161	Like, you know, have a gimme trophy in the game that still gets you something cute.
2525201	2527564	The perfect way to sum it up.
2528064	2535932	Treat trophies and achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2 like you treat getting stickers in LittleBigPlanet.
2537748	2538109	Love it.
2538810	2541657	Or what PlayStation was supposed to do at PlayStation Home.
2542138	2544583	Remember the concept of actual trophies on your shelf?
2544603	2545665	PlayStation Home.
2545785	2546567	Come on, man.
2549741	2550722	Nintendo would never.
2550842	2551663	Nintendo would never.
2552703	2555606	And I actually... Thank you for reminding me of this point.
2555666	2562631	I thought of this when I was putting the story in the show role, especially when I was thinking about the people that are so anti-achievement and good.
2562651	2563251	I don't want it.
2563332	2565433	I don't need that competitive nature on my system.
2565473	2566914	I don't want people knowing what I'm playing.
2566974	2567395	I was like...
2568275	2572758	Quest Buster says, let's go back to the days of when we mailed in for an Activision patch.
2573098	2574459	You can sew on your jacket.
2574719	2575119	Absolutely.
2575139	2576820	The most old school achievement there is.
2577260	2579861	And I love that because it's a totally optional thing.
2580182	2587506	But if you want to have that cool ass fucking leather jacket with the sew-ons for all the game stuff you beat, I think that's such a great idea.
2588046	2589166	Like, oh my God.
2589767	2590527	Can you imagine?
2590887	2594810	But they would never gatekeep Nintendo clothing based on game performance.
2594870	2595490	They just wouldn't.
2596450	2596751	So...
2598601	2601823	Oh man, I love the idea of like Nintendo, just a virtual Nintendo pad.
2601883	2604844	Anyway, but Nintendo doesn't see the fun in it.
2604884	2605565	They don't want to do it.
2605625	2610227	Even though I just, you know, between us and chat, we just described like five different ways they can make it fun.
2610767	2611967	They're just not interested in that.
2612068	2618390	They're going to say, we're focused on making the games until we can make money off the achievement system.
2618430	2620451	We don't find sell stickers, I guess.
2620711	2621032	Fine.
2621412	2623793	Sell stickers for profiles if that makes you feel better.
2626499	2628661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2648240	2650741	Death Stranding 2 On The Beach, Hideo Kojima
2667009	2667850	Thank you for watching!
2684610	2688794	Also, it was shared in that same interview, Death Stranding 2 is 95% complete.
2689535	2692518	It feels like it is 10pm, speaking of 24 hours.
2692538	2696001	Death Stranding 2 is at 10 o'clock and there are two hours left.
2696441	2698463	The date of the release is June 26th.
2698703	2699644	Ooh, my birthday.
2699684	2701085	I get a Death Stranding 2 on my birthday.
2702326	2705389	And yeah, it's supposed to be 95% complete and will come out then.
2706630	2708532	Interesting take on the boss fights.
2708652	2708892	I mean...
2710003	2716390	Again, I don't... Like, if somebody else skips a boss fight, that doesn't affect my enjoyability of the game.
2717311	2718252	So I don't really care.
2718272	2721155	I don't know.
2721656	2726020	People are dumb about the whole, like, oh, it's not hard enough, and why do you get a pass...
2727313	2730415	Why can't it be more accessible to people?
2730655	2731596	I think it's a great idea.
2734298	2740622	Again, this could be a thing where achievements, fine, you don't get the achievement for killing the boss if you didn't actually kill the boss.
2741122	2746206	But if you're not interested in showing off that kind of gamer credit, that shouldn't fucking matter.
2746786	2747367	It shouldn't matter.
2748783	2750584	But some people want to have it both ways.
2751204	2753585	They want to say, well, I want to skip the boss.
2754286	2758487	And because I didn't do, I want to make sure nobody can see that I skipped the boss.
2760809	2765671	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the reasoning you will hear is, if the option is there, I might use it.
2766051	2768072	And I don't want that option to be available to me.
2768172	2769252	Sounds like a you problem.
2769953	2772294	It's time to take some motherfucking accountability, gamers.
2774244	2774864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2795250	2795811	Yeah, I like that.
2796111	2802159	I can't control myself, so all of you need to make laws so that we can't do it.
2802740	2804962	Talk about a certain political party's agenda.
2806346	2810227	I can't control myself, therefore I must pass laws against it.
2810587	2817309	We gotta ban pornography because I can't... Listen, you know, I'm keeping tabs on my son's pornography.
2817389	2819570	My son is keeping tabs on my pornography.
2819650	2823291	So therefore, you know, we have a buddy system.
2823311	2825132	We trust because we're pure Christians.
2825452	2827132	I'm sorry, that's the Speaker of the House, by the way.
2827152	2829073	You know, not to get confused here.
2829533	2832074	But yeah, it's ridiculous.
2833168	2835650	For the record though, Bobby was absolutely right with that comment.
2835770	2838752	So me saying all that had nothing to do against Bobby.
2839172	2841154	Bobby is absolutely 100% correct with that comment.
2841174	2842815	There will be gamers that will complain about that shit.
2843195	2846218	And my message to them is get over it.
2846238	2847438	We don't fucking care.
2847458	2847919	That's right.
2847939	2850381	It's like, do you run this game company?
2850481	2851201	No, fuck off.
2851221	2851702	Bye.
2851742	2853723	Thank you for your opinion.
2854043	2855785	Your opinion is valuable to us.
2855865	2856785	Thank you for sharing.
2856845	2857646	Pat, pat, pat.
2857666	2858246	Here's a cookie.
2858286	2858587	Bye.
2859574	2869680	they'll just get pissed off because there'll be a person of color in the game or something like that too or a woman so god forbid you know ow the accuracy no i mean like ow um
2871753	2872593	Ow, the truth hurts.
2875135	2875455	Correct.
2876615	2882558	Yeah, Tigerclaw points out Florida banned porn or rather Pornhub is banned in Florida unless you use a VPN to bypass.
2883499	2883879	Correct.
2883919	2885239	And that's not the only state to do it too.
2885860	2890562	When we went to Florida recently for the cruise, all my friends were like, try getting on Pornhub and see what happens.
2890622	2892483	And I was like, I already know what happens.
2892543	2895484	I don't need to get irritated, you know.
2896125	2896445	But...
2898207	2903475	Florida may have banned Pornhub, but I bet there's still going to be ways for people to get their porn.
2904036	2904637	It's okay.
2904717	2909064	They banned porn, but hey, children can work in the factories now, so that's a thing.
2911345	2912706	Let's move on to our next story.
2915408	2919551	And the people that might... Are we not going to be spicy in this political environment?
2919711	2924655	I didn't realize DarkSakura was the one that was grounding the political spiciness on this show.
2924755	2925696	What the fuck?
2925816	2927837	Usually she's the first one to pop off.
2928198	2930139	And tonight we're just unrestrained.
2931300	2936784	Can't possibly just exist in this world being constantly... You try to avoid it all online.
2936804	2938065	It's like, I'm just going to avoid it.
2938205	2939066	I'm just going to go...
2940509	2941870	Just go on with my day.
2942290	2947152	And then, like, you hear about something else, like... Like... Yeah.
2948833	2949213	Anyway.
2949394	2952155	Yeah, DarkSakura says, yeah, Rob is so done with his bullshit.
2952215	2953035	Oh, he's been done.
2953336	2953936	He's been done.
2954056	2954636	All right, anyway.
2955737	2959659	Moving on, talking about games that might be made in a factory later.
2960299	2963081	There was a Spanish developer that went by the name TequilaWorks.
2963481	2965102	They made Rime and...
2965822	2967523	Guilt, G-Y-L-T.
2967883	2971826	They also published the sexy Brutal, but they created Rhyme and Guilt.
2972866	2981372	The studio unfortunately went under in 2024 because prolonged market conditions made it financially difficult to stay afloat, and so they went under.
2981852	2994940	The games that they made, as well as the IP, intellectual property rights, are now available to bid on the auction site Escrapalia, which I believe would be a Spanish bidding site.
2995660	2998222	because Tequila Works was a Spanish developer.
2999123	3002745	This would include Deadlight, Rime, and Guilt.
3003646	3006468	Also, in-development projects are being auctioned off.
3006688	3010490	The Ancient Mariner, Dungeon Tour, and Brawler Crawler.
3010550	3011871	These are unfinished games.
3012852	3023859	So the studio did release Song of Nunu, a League of Legends story, but then they closed, basically, after Tencent got a controlling stake in Tequila Works.
3026341	3026881	They are gone.
3026941	3031504	I'm kind of curious, like, how much is this going for right now, actually?
3032324	3034565	I don't see... Here we go.
3034685	3040449	Oh, so if you wanted the trademark to rhyme, that is currently going for 15,500 euros.
3045086	3047088	Deadlight is at 11,000 euros Deadlight is at 11,000 euros
3063365	3068668	That's not bad for a game that probably paid a lot more people their time to create.
3069108	3071949	Same thing with this Dungeon Tour and Brawler Crawler.
3072629	3078152	It almost looked like somebody has bid one euro above the minimum.
3078752	3080673	I almost feel like somebody's bid the minimum.
3081233	3082434	Oh no, I guess it says 140 bids, 65 bids.
3082454	3082694	Interesting.
3086776	3088197	There's no reserve price.
3089218	3090498	Yeah, I guess no reserve price.
3090518	3093320	This is how high it's gotten without a reserve.
3093720	3095662	So what, 30 days left?
3095702	3098423	There's still a lot of time left, so we'll see what these holes really go for.
3098503	3107629	But yeah, that's where things stand today for a publisher to potentially just say, we're going to make our own sequel to Guilt and put the name on it.
3108510	3109030	We can do that.
3109991	3111672	All right, let's move on.
3111752	3111992	Loki.
3113666	3114066	All right.
3114827	3130034	Well, a former CEO of PlayStation was on... Was it... Speaking to PlayerDrive in a video chat, Sean Layden, mentioning that, you know, if you account for inflation, game prices have gone down.
3130514	3131035	Once again...
3132000	3133521	We'll explain why that's wrong.
3134141	3135222	That doesn't make any sense.
3136363	3143047	Two, he also says that, you know, game companies should just add $5 to the price of games per generation.
3143487	3150051	That way that, you know, gamers are more eased into the higher prices as stuff goes on.
3150371	3152173	He says in 2025, you know, $59.99 in 1999 is like the equivalent to $100.
3156395	3163481	So as you know, your purchasing power compared to that against your cost of living is smaller than it was.
3165534	3171937	But still, companies have been reluctant to push that price up because they probably should have done it.
3172877	3180920	I was in, at the time, probably every generation should have baked in a $5 software price hike and make that typical.
3181280	3186482	Well, every generation is another $5 and you would have gone up to $90 by now.
3186902	3187883	First off, fuck you.
3188063	3191304	And second off, once again, the false...
3193168	3204191	The false comparison against saying games are cheaper than they are now completely ignores the fact that we don't purchase games like we did back in the 90s.
3204271	3207132	So he wants to equate it to 1999.
3207172	3218755	So 1999, you would buy a PlayStation 2 game that was, well, first off, it wasn't $59.99, it was $49.99, and the game was complete.
3219296	3220156	You got your game.
3220876	3221516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3245839	3257426	Once again, like I said, that completely ignores the fact that not only are games more expensive now, but then you're piecemealing all this shit that would have been free with your full game back in the day.
3257506	3264670	So, for example, one of the very first games to actually kind of have...
3265830	3271075	A multi-platform release that was on a system that was on the Xbox 360.
3271535	3275059	It was a lot more piecemeal with DLC and stuff like that.
3275439	3277821	And then on PlayStation 2 and the original Xbox.
3278061	3280343	That game being, I believe it was Scarface.
3280403	3281424	Is it Scarface or Mafia?
3282765	3287209	Scarface had basically, like it did back in the day...
3288174	3295821	Cheat codes they could put in with controller presses on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox that didn't really have a big marketplace where you could buy all this DLC.
3296342	3296963	On the Xbox 360...
3298803	3300164	Those button presses weren't in there.
3300344	3305186	You had to purchase your cheats separately because they were selling it back to you.
3305267	3309409	So they were physically cutting content out of the game and then selling it back to you.
3309869	3326278	On top of all of the monetization with microtransactions, all of this season pass nonsense where you're pre-ordering DLC that may or may not come out, games being released in a buggy, unfinished state in the first place because now we have the ability to patch those in later on.
3326778	3342186	and so games are coming out fundamentally broken and with a roadmap of how they're going to fix it over the course of 6 to 12 months if they even do all that because if it's not making money then they're not going to invest money into it so I'm sorry you cannot say that it's exactly the same and that we should be paying more
3342746	3343346	Thank you for watching!
3366617	3367338	It's just not.
3367498	3373245	So once again, to summarize, fuck you, Sean Layden, and this is bullshit.
3374186	3377649	DJ Ranma S in chat says, meanwhile, the cost of living hasn't gone up.
3377850	3378530	Fuck out of here.
3379191	3380032	I do agree with that.
3380092	3383956	And actually, I want to share something with you all that I was just kind of Googling.
3383996	3386539	I was like, what is Sean Layden's net worth?
3386779	3387300	What is this?
3387660	3389141	And I want to share something I found with you.
3389221	3395164	Now, I'm going to state clearly, this is for the purposes of entertainment only and is not to be accepted as fact.
3395444	3400046	Because again, the site that came up has AI in the title, so I already distrust it.
3400406	3407109	But I think we're going to... I still want to drive the car to something that I think many of us would go, you know, I do hear about this.
3407189	3411711	This is in line with what I hear in the news about CEOs and things of that sort.
3411791	3412032	Okay?
3412072	3412412	But again...
3413092	3418717	I'm presenting this as probably made-up shit, but in line with the real shit, okay?
3419798	3420959	For the purposes of entertainment.
3420999	3425362	So this website claims that in 2021, Sean Landon's net worth was $966,000.
3425563	3432208	In 2025, that net worth is $1.61 million.
3432488	3436071	See, I already distrust it because I know he made more than that when he was working at the company.
3436372	3438714	I think this is probably some type of social media algorithm.
3438814	3441036	However, the point still stands.
3441656	3443638	How much did you make in 2021?
3444960	3446121	And how much do you make today?
3446982	3447783	Did it go up by 170%?
3447863	3460477	Or is Shawn Layton potentially, possibly, theoretically living in a bubble that the rest of us, that isn't the reality for the rest of us?
3464335	3486843	yeah think about that next time you read an article about what is true what is fact is that CEOs get multi-million dollar bonuses and you hear about it in the news all of the time so anyway yeah this is the dam that has to break who is making money off video games and why
3488171	3489171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3512538	3535302	are fat and piggish um so these people that are sitting at the top of the uh industry are making all this money just to make bad decisions like oh we should replace people with AI when AI doesn't get shit right that same fucking article I quoted earlier in the show about how did the spread of misinformation on the cost of a video game happen
3536996	3541318	AI was still reporting at the time of that article that Mario Kart World would cost $90.
3542139	3542959	That was in the AI.
3544020	3547501	Because when you say something on the internet so much, AI accepts it to be fact.
3548862	3560768	And this is what fat pigs, metaphor, in Washington, in gaming companies, believe can replace people.
3561588	3563269	Broken fucking algorithms.
3566121	3571183	and there's going to come a point where people go, what are the fat pigs doing for us?
3573965	3575145	Tomorrow we're having bacon.
3578887	3580128	Let's move on to our next story.
3584470	3585330	Is it mine or yours?
3585390	3586111	I don't even know now.
3586831	3587351	It's yours.
3587391	3590073	It'll be soft.
3590153	3592814	Let's talk about the fattest fucking pig in the room.
3595495	3596696	In the bank account, of course.
3597797	3600659	Let's talk about this whole thing with the crew.
3601760	3608925	And the crew, you know, people actually went to a class action lawsuit over the crew because the servers shut down.
3609365	3620093	So players in California last year filed a lawsuit saying that once you shut down the title, they, thousands of other people that played this game, got a skeleton of what you thought you paid for.
3620854	3627277	The argument was the crew should have been left in a playable offline state rather than being delisted and taken offline.
3627618	3634981	But Ubisoft said they had to do it because of server infrastructure and licensing constraints, but they maintained support for over a decade.
3635402	3643026	But again, in the lawsuit for the folks in California that filed the lawsuit, they felt totally barred access to the product they paid money for.
3643746	3656669	Imagine you buy a pinball machine and years later you enter your den to go play it only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed.
3657329	3659589	That is in the lawsuit, that verbiage.
3660349	3669051	Turns out the pinball machine manufacturer decided to come into your house, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned.
3670765	3678496	Well, Ubisoft filed a response in February saying the argument that the crew is going to be playable indefinitely is misleading.
3679217	3683904	It was explicitly selling temporary access to a product and not outright ownership.
3684801	3694986	In the response, they said plaintiffs do not allege that Ubisoft made any statements indicating that consumers would in fact obtain unfettered access to the crew if they purchased a physical copy.
3695726	3699808	To the contrary, the packaging made clear that Ubisoft could limit access.
3700369	3703911	This is fatal to plaintiffs FAL, UCL, and CLRA claims.
3704351	3712595	Plaintiffs' entire theory of the case is based on the faulty assumption that buying a physical disc entitles purchasers to infinite access to play the game.
3715553	3721257	They go on to say this flawed assumption doesn't necessarily make it misrepresentation under California law.
3721697	3739130	And they were selling a license to a product as opposed to ownership rights, which by the way, you know, the license that these rules have changed in California that when you're in these stores buying these products on digital stores, it now has to tell you it's a digital license and can't use words like owned forever and things like that.
3739170	3740271	They can't use those types of words.
3741794	3750321	Apparently the plaintiffs have responded and there was a picture of the crew's packaging which notes the activation code won't expire until 2099.
3750401	3754864	That is damning evidence in my opinion.
3755344	3755765	Damning.
3756605	3763150	They said it's an example of Ubisoft indicating the crew would remain playable during this time and long thereafter.
3764251	3765992	In my opinion, that is a smoking gun.
3766913	3767454	But we'll see.
3768913	3771616	I'm not a fucking lawyer, for better or for worse.
3772076	3775739	So I don't know what ultimately will come of this in court.
3775819	3781624	But Ubisoft, including something that says this will work until 2099, not a great look.
3782744	3786908	What is it, like, if ownership isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing?
3789451	3790512	I believe that was the line.
3790792	3802803	Which again, I don't endorse piracy, but I think we all need to open our fucking eyes that as the industry gets more and more greedy when it comes to the price of games, people are going to turn to piracy.
3808128	3814550	I really think you're going to see more indie and small studios where the fat pigs aren't so fat.
3814570	3815270	They're a little leaner.
3818251	3829493	You're going to see that their games that are priced at $20 and $30 because they don't have to pay multi-million dollar CEO salaries and they're not publicly traded companies that are obligated to make money for their investors.
3829914	3832754	I think you're going to see more successes on that front.
3833054	3835615	More Five Nights at Freddy's, more Minecrafts, more
3836295	3839596	Um, Bellatros, more, you're gonna see more of that.
3839697	3843038	Shredder's Revenge, $20 game, playing behind Loki right now.
3843278	3843478	Right?
3843498	3843478	$20?
3844098	3845179	$30?
3844939	3845179	Still.
3845719	3846159	Not much.
3846239	3846559	Less than $80.
3849180	3849461	Anyway.
3850861	3851321	Uh, let's see.
3851642	3859265	Bobby Black of his chat says, EULA's end user license agreement haven't been really tested in court yet, so it may or may not be a binding contract.
3859485	3859905	That's true.
3859985	3862066	All these things tend to settle out of court.
3864158	3889786	well also when you think about it like with with those EULAs or whatever especially when we're talking about the crew which is an E10 game or probably at most teen um your user could be underage which case it would not be able to you know abide by your contract and they could still have purchased the game legally too so once again you have no contract at that point yeah
3892455	3914913	well we'll see we'll see what develops with this but I don't know I don't know like look look I I think this is also a symptom of publishers trying to catch that coin of the always online um games as a service because that's what the crew was at the end of the day games as a service this is a symptom of of companies trying to forever chase that is that
3918022	3921566	They didn't consider this end of what's going to happen when we pull the plug on the game.
3921826	3925029	And there's going to be some pissed off people that still want to be able to play this game that they bought.
3925490	3929214	And they're trying to rely on this whole, well, we never told you that you'd own this game forever.
3929494	3931556	But we took all your money, like it would be.
3932097	3934239	It's just, at some point, that dam's going to break.
3936485	3937686	Oh yeah, Questbusters.
3937846	3939366	Love this quote from Questbuster in chat.
3939386	3944389	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network live on Sunday night saying, we can't make SimCity offline.
3944949	3947930	What EA said about the last SimCity before making it offline.
3951972	3956534	Let's talk about, look, I've been giving a lot of people in the industry hell.
3957975	3958975	on the top of the industry.
3959055	3964877	Never the hardworking devs and frontline people actually making the games, but the people at the top in the boardrooms.
3964957	3966478	I've been giving them a lot of shit tonight.
3967378	3969079	I have something nice to say now.
3969259	3971239	I'm going to say something nice about one of them.
3971879	3972920	So note the date and time.
3974581	3979726	Matt Karsh, CEO and Co-Founder of Saber Interactive
3989079	3993341	to help, quote, shape the next generation of creative leaders in the video game industry.
4004127	4011931	To be fair, Sony Interactive Entertainment donated $3 million to the University of Southern California's Gerald A. Lawson Fund in 2022.
4012772	4013852	But that is a company.
4014252	4022397	This is one person that is a CEO at a company that, you know, what did these guys make?
4022477	4023077	Timeshift?
4023297	4024178	That's their game, right?
4024818	4029901	So, you know, it's nice to see people using that money.
4031330	4033792	Oh, Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2.
4033892	4036573	That's their big latest title that they did.
4037233	4047859	So it's nice to see somebody give a little bit of that money back because some people don't need all of those millions and billions of dollars in order to lead a happy life.
4048199	4049720	You can use that money for good.
4050240	4059325	So kudos to the CEO there at Saber Interactive for doing something good there to help shape future people in the industry.
4059966	4060086	So...
4060806	4063829	Bobby Blackwolf points out they're a former Embracer subsidiary.
4064129	4065230	3D Realms is part of them.
4065310	4065851	Oh, interesting.
4066411	4067132	That's pretty interesting.
4068473	4076720	All right, Loki, let's talk about the Minecraft movie and some interesting, which by the way is still making tons of fucking money, right?
4076780	4077581	Half a billion dollars now?
4077601	4078342	Yeah, almost like half a million.
4078622	4079083	Half a billion.
4079103	4079803	Yeah, half a billion.
4079923	4080204	Yeah.
4080744	4083827	So, yeah, what's going on with the Minecraft movie showings, Loki?
4083847	4083927	Okay.
4084824	4087210	It's just basically the same nonsense that's been going on.
4087270	4092762	Obviously one of the things that's been popular with the Minecraft movie is shouting out all the lines that were in the trailers.
4093690	4116384	um you know like the chicken jockey thing um you flint and steel all that type of stuff but the problem is it's become I think this is more of like a you know social media like kind of meme thing where they start um not only just shouting out the lines in the theaters but throwing popcorn at the same time and making an absolute mess of the theaters of course uh
4117543	4144977	the director of the movie Jared Hess is completely cool with that thinking like hey no harm you know it's just been crazy people are sending me some really hilarious speeches that they're doing standing up in the middle you know before the movie starts and you know it's it's hilarious you know I think it's funny that people are cheering and throwing popcorn which is funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn cops are getting called because they're causing a lot of ruckus it's not just popcorn it's like all sorts of like
4145737	4161022	stuff happening where they're asking them to basically behave in a theater and they're not and it's not fair for the employees that have to clean up that mess either because everyone wants to participate in a meme or like you know clout for social media or something like that.
4162444	4175617	But yeah, so basically a take on it is Jared Hess is obviously for it because he's making tons of money from people going to the theater that have this type of experience, you know, repeat viewers and whatnot of the Minecraft movie.
4176198	4185548	And of course, he's not going to say, hey, tone it down a bit, you know, so they're trying to make it into like an event where people just go and shout out the lines at the screen and stuff.
4186132	4192296	I appreciate that some theaters are advertising a 4D experience for people that want to be rowdy.
4192536	4195758	I don't love the Rocky Horror comparisons.
4195878	4196459	I really don't.
4196479	4199120	And I'm somebody that's been involved with Rocky for like 20 years.
4199601	4209687	And the reason why is that Rocky Horror also kind of exists as like this safe space, especially in the 70s, especially when this whole thing started in New York City with the cult screenings.
4210027	4212309	It really existed as a safe place for
4212569	4223898	for, uh, people that really didn't fit in anywhere else to be able to congregate weekly and, you know, get out their frustrations, you know, watch this really bad movie together as a family and all of this stuff.
4224378	4227420	I don't really see those parallels when it comes to Minecraft.
4227440	4232464	And also the important thing about Rocky Horror is that you know what you're getting into when you go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
4232524	4234966	It is always advertised as a, you know, it's
4235126	4236027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4259204	4263648	We've all been to a movie where somebody yells back at the screen or somebody in the audience.
4263708	4270294	Remember when we went to see The Grudge and I yelled at somebody in the back of the theater saying, would the guy with the little dick in the back of the room please shut the fuck up?
4270715	4277841	Because he kept – I shouted this at the top of my lung because this guy in the back during all the scary scenes in this movie was going –
4278462	4280382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4304358	4325821	so um well yeah whatever it's it's it's and it's i would never do that to kids and it's you know but i also would know to avoid the showings of the minecraft movie where there are a lot of kids like well it's not necessarily kids i think it's like older kids and like college teenagers the worst you know basically
4327022	4330906	You know, kids going there by themselves, not with, obviously, a family.
4330966	4332528	The family's not, you know, encouraging them.
4332768	4336552	I'm sure shouting, like, the line or saying the line or something like that, that's fine.
4337192	4341117	But there's people that, like, take it too far and are super obnoxious with it.
4341157	4344180	Throwing the food is just stupid anyways because...
4345678	4351121	Unless it's advertised that way as a fuck-it-all type of experience, then fine.
4352302	4355303	And one good yell is fine.
4355323	4360526	I'm not saying everything has to be, oh, it's a prim and proper night at the theater, and everybody shut the fuck up.
4360826	4363468	But look, there were a lot of people that didn't want to see Wicked.
4363968	4365749	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4385458	4385678	Yeah.
4386740	4387581	And I don't know.
4387661	4392046	I think, for the most part, at least the two that I saw, it wasn't too bad.
4392126	4398594	There was a few obnoxious people shouting a lot at some of the stuff, overreacting to it.
4398974	4402058	But it was minor, and it wasn't involving throwing food or anything.
4402078	4402919	Because I can tell you...
4404233	4409918	Do you really want to risk that in this type of an environment with the people that are just pissed off at everything?
4409958	4415582	You're going to throw sodas, going to land on somebody, and they're going to come destroy that child, you know?
4416062	4416363	It's just...
4417423	4423345	That's why the police are getting called, because you're essentially... Throwing a soda at somebody is a little much.
4423565	4423906	Yeah.
4424906	4425246	Let's see.
4425326	4428507	Are there other things that I heard or read?
4428707	4434310	Was it people throwing up or, like, pretending to throw up?
4434430	4436570	Bringing live chickens into the theater?
4436590	4437651	Yeah, that's what Def just said.
4437691	4439672	An actual living chicken into the theater?
4439852	4440052	That's...
4441192	4456112	y'all we don't even let you have real it's everybody trying to one up somebody for social media clout and for the record at Rocky Horror Picture Show we don't even let you bring real lighters anymore in fact you can't throw rice you can't throw fucking rice anymore because it's too much of a pain in the ass to clean up and
4456152	4459554	And I think with the same logic with weddings too.
4459674	4465077	Like it's just not that there's birds inside the theater, but a lot of it gets swept up and swept outside where the birds might pick it up.
4465157	4471942	So use bubbles, use iPhone lights or like apps that look like lighters for there's a light.
4472282	4474983	Actually glow sticks is the big thing now because glow sticks are so cheap.
4475023	4479086	You just sell like a quarter for a glow stick and people use that during there's a light.
4479426	4481547	But it's like, oh my God, actual animals?
4482308	4484009	Please, please, please.
4515283	4543679	and I don't it's just because I don't know anyway but no fucking real animals get a grip Jesus all right um yeah let's move I'll still see Minecraft in a couple more weeks in a couple more weeks when this dies down a little more when some other new kiddie movie comes out that everybody else is distracted with we'll go see we'll go see I will leave it on Stitch well that's all July there's a lot of stuff coming out in July
4544385	4546947	By the way, didn't that movie about Sacramento come out this week?
4547587	4548268	The Michael Cera?
4548308	4549329	I saw the poster.
4549649	4553271	Yeah, because apparently we get Michael Cera as our poster child.
4553331	4553711	Yay.
4554512	4556433	Yeah, no, they made a whole fucking movie about Sacramento.
4556453	4557894	I think it's like a road trip or something.
4557974	4563358	But that really, oh God, she's so funny on that movie, that Pen15.
4563818	4564659	She was on that show.
4564999	4565719	She's in this movie.
4565740	4566060	Oh, yeah.
4566280	4567781	Maya, is that her name?
4568882	4570883	She's so funny in that show.
4570963	4571784	And she's in this movie.
4571804	4573345	And I would see it because she's in it.
4574147	4575688	So we'll see.
4575808	4576048	Anyway.
4576828	4577148	All right.
4578229	4580930	Speaking of Minecraft, I think this is very interesting.
4583711	4600137	The Minecraft soundtrack is going to be officially preserved for all eternity or until the end of our society as a nation, which could be a little sooner, with the preservation of the Minecraft soundtrack in the USA's Library of Congress.
4600697	4601057	That's right.
4601377	4608142	The original music for Minecraft is being inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.
4608182	4618548	So it's now part of the American Archives, which is interesting because it was composed by a German producer, Daniel Rosenfeld, known as C418.
4618628	4623231	But obviously, still, we have lots of foreign influence in our society.
4623251	4627174	A lot of the great artists and sculptures and paintings were from all over the world.
4627574	4628575	So this is just another...
4629719	4632482	The Reboot Sound for Windows 95, which I never knew was a Brian Eno, did he?
4648176	4650398	Which is one of those like new wave guys.
4651679	4652640	I did not know that.
4652700	4658305	But yeah, that was also apparently inducted into the registry, the Library of Congress.
4658425	4671856	Two of the 25 recordings that made up the additions for this year, which by the way, include other more traditional types of songs, such as the 2015 original Broadway cast of Hamilton.
4671876	4672377	Yeah.
4672677	4678462	Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and so on and so on, just to give you some examples of other things that are in there.
4678482	4681865	So the Minecraft soundtrack is kind of along with that, which is kind of neat.
4682505	4684487	So, all right.
4686448	4691853	With that, I think that's a good segment for us to get into the classic game of the week.
4692113	4692874	Let's get into it.
4704628	4711931	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4712392	4714933	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4717073	4723756	DarkSakura isn't here tonight, so usually when DarkSakura isn't here, one of us will take over this segment for tonight.
4724476	4728658	So we're actually going to let Loki pick the classic game of the week.
4729518	4736901	Now, I just want to remind everybody, the rule that's out there for the classic game of the week is that the game has to be 10 years old.
4738241	4741843	Old or More to be inducted as a Classic Game of the Week.
4741943	4746945	And I just want you to keep that in the back of your head as we talk about tonight's inductee by Loki.
4747005	4749947	Loki, what is being inducted as a Classic Game of the Week tonight?
4750847	4758691	And believe it or not, it's actually almost 12 years old, but Grand Theft Auto V. Yes, the game that is still popular.
4758711	4759211	Still being played.
4759231	4761292	Grand Theft Auto V. It came out in September of 2013.
4761332	4761732	I remember that.
4768015	4768595	and DarkSakura.com
4789511	4797195	It's, you know, obviously Grand Theft Auto is known for its, like, you know, free roam and, you know, crime kind of simulator type games.
4797875	4808101	This one had a really great story, I think, what was unique about it, obviously, with the three different protagonists, you can kind of jump into each one of them at different times and take on the lead as those.
4809041	4814024	Of course, there was a big, massive push for online as well, so we had...
4815097	4842682	Grand Theft Auto Online but yes originally this was released on September 2013 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 later on it would then come out on in November of 2014 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One April 2015 on Windows and then of course a little bit more recent March 2022 on PlayStation 5 and then the Xbox Series
4844092	4852982	So yeah, it's been re-released a lot of times, and you bet your butt it's probably coming to the Switch 2 as well, so expect that at some point.
4854004	4857067	I don't know when, but it's probably coming.
4858309	4858469	Yeah.
4859628	4863112	So obviously this game has made so much money.
4863412	4864213	I don't even know.
4864894	4867497	Billions upon billions upon billions of dollars.
4869439	4876207	Most of that, like I said, is due to Grand Theft Auto Online, the very persistent games as a service.
4877762	4904658	Just persistent online space where you can do heists, all sorts of different mission types All the trappings of something that is trying to take your money Basically having to pay for every little thing Sports cars, rent, people to maintain your car Your car gets exploded, you gotta buy a new car, fix it up Gotta pay for all that, it ain't free
4905238	4906138	SpikeVGX in 2013
4932984	4933524	Thanks for watching!
4951895	4956638	And it's only a matter of time before we find out what's in Grand Theft Auto 6.
4956778	4957238	Oh, here we go.
4958038	4971425	It is the second best video game of all time with 210 million copies sold and making $8.5 billion worldwide in revenue.
4972426	4974006	But that's not enough, obviously.
4974627	4975987	They gotta make more money.
4976548	4976708	So...
4978698	4980239	Yeah, that's your classic game of the week.
4980259	4981720	Gotta keep renting that money.
4982220	4982541	Nice.
4983681	4995129	Alright, well, you knew, Loki, you would have to pick this one someday, but I just think it's so funny that this game is only, or this game is already 13 years old, right?
4995189	5003594	I mean, and 13, yeah, considering it's 13 years old, like, or not 13 years old, but it's like 12 years old at this point, or almost 12.
5004555	5006596	Considering that, it was like so incredible
5008158	5018348	The details that they put into this game, which is even the movement and the graphics and everything, it's going to be a wonder to see what Grand Theft Auto 6 looks like when that's released.
5019732	5022193	It really is going to be groundbreaking.
5022233	5024813	So I'm very excited to see what that looks like.
5025373	5026313	Quest Buster in chat.
5026453	5028814	Not for $120 at retail, hopefully, but we'll see.
5028874	5029254	Let's hope.
5029814	5034355	Quest Buster in chat points out, well, it'll be $80 now that Nintendo's gotten us there.
5034915	5039076	And then it's just a question of what add-ons are they going to sell you to make it $120?
5039116	5043357	What are they going to put into the online to make it $120?
5045018	5050625	By the way, it looks like we're just having some quick lag issues on Discord, so Loki's face is frozen right now, but I don't know.
5050885	5051145	Oh, fun.
5051165	5052547	Yeah, it's just a Discord thing.
5052968	5056933	I might be able to set... I'm going to do a quick one, too, just to... I don't think it's a Discord thing.
5056973	5058755	I think it's my camera app, actually.
5058955	5059296	Oh, okay.
5059376	5059696	Oh, phew.
5059776	5061238	Okay.
5061318	5063401	We'll just reset that.
5063621	5064221	There you go, yeah.
5064281	5071823	Take care of that while I mention from the chat, QuestBuster talks about the roleplay community is pretty incredible around GTA Online.
5071884	5077545	I've watched streams where people actually act as cops and robbers, perform due process and everything.
5077825	5081666	Yeah, it's... I've seen some of those roleplay streams... Oh, there you go, you're better.
5082247	5090349	I've seen some of those roleplay streams too, which are really... It's a lot, but it's... I mean, that's cool that people go all the way with it like that.
5090449	5092990	Like, if you're gonna commit to the bit, commit to the bit.
5095180	5097984	Let's talk about some other headlines in Rapid Fire News.
5098104	5098425	Loki.
5099867	5101329	Man, they keep teasing me like this.
5102671	5109621	We're going to suspend disbelief again, but apparently there's a leaker out there, an Apex Legends leaker.
5110287	5123696	who maybe have some sort of credibility, says that Titanfall 3 is actually happening and that it's going to feature the Apex Legends cast and it's going to multiplayer and campaign and all that fun stuff.
5125137	5131341	This, I guess, was leaked April 9th and said, yeah, it's almost complete.
5133062	5134643	We shall see.
5135004	5136605	I don't know, but...
5137952	5144619	What a lovely thing to announce at Summer Game Fest for release this holiday, but what do I know?
5145720	5148422	Yep, so we'll have to wait and see if that actually happens.
5149663	5156770	Then, of course, Xbox, their big summer showcase, is going to have an entire...
5157885	5158305	Outer Worlds
5188184	5192746	I could be into that.
5192987	5194247	I could be into an Oblivion remake.
5194267	5194627	We'll see.
5195328	5195588	Alright.
5195728	5198369	Because that means more Oblivion mods.
5198749	5199670	So, we'll see.
5200770	5204292	And then somebody that will inevitably create Oblivion and Skyrim in the same game.
5204352	5205733	Actually, that probably already exists somewhere.
5206153	5206893	I think that already exists.
5206933	5207754	Yes, of course it does.
5207774	5208174	Of course it does.
5208594	5209875	How dare I think otherwise?
5210855	5214176	Let's move on and talk about Street Fighter VI, which we were talking about earlier in the show.
5214757	5218018	We know that on June 5th, a new character is going to be coming out.
5218218	5227622	Elena will be the addition to the roster, which she was in Street Fighter III Strike, if I remember correctly, because I believe she was the character I preferred to play because she kind of dances.
5228122	5230143	She fights from dancing.
5231223	5241447	and this of course is being timed quite well with the launch of the Switch 2 version and the Year 1 through 2 Fighters Edition which is what basically the Switch 2 version is.
5242007	5244308	So yeah, Elena will be added on June 5th.
5244648	5252532	You can purchase with Fighter Coins and if you have the Year 2 Character Pass or Ultimate Pass, you automatically will get access to Elena.
5253872	5258074	Note that depending on your time zone, Elena may actually release on June 4th
5258894	5261415	following server maintenance, depending on where you are.
5261855	5264257	So fun new character for the game there.
5265097	5267618	And we have some new updates to Switch Online.
5267658	5271320	We have some new Genesis games or Mega Drive games, depending on where you live.
5271980	5275522	So this would mean it's for the Nintendo Switch Online expansion pack.
5277049	5281493	Um, which, uh, will add these three Genesis games to the collection.
5281893	5290360	Streets of Rage, the OG one, uh, is being released along with Super Thunder Blade and E-SWAT, City Under Siege.
5290560	5293442	All of those making their way to Switch Online.
5294723	5295644	I believe they're already there.
5295784	5297065	They got added earlier this week.
5297205	5297925	So enjoy.
5297946	5304290	Uh, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games coming out soon.

5593430	5593911	Yep, yep, yep.
5594171	5594471	All right.
5594951	5597153	Well, we got one more story for you tonight.
5597213	5603459	We were talking about a particular TV show and how appropriately timed for the return of said TV show, right, Loki?
5604372	5614014	Yes, because, because, you know, you're just worried that like, hey, Last of Us Season 2 is launching on Max.
5614614	5617375	I want to say HBO, but yeah, I guess it's still Max now.
5618475	5621276	How am I going to ever play The Last of Us?
5621796	5625257	There's not like re-released, re-released, re-released games.
5626077	5628298	If only there was a solution to this problem.
5628358	5629278	Well, don't worry.
5629898	5633419	Sony has let you know that The Last of Us Complete,
5635019	5645524	The Last of Us Part 1 and Part 2 Remastered into a single package It is $100 And you can buy it You can consume Fuck off!
5645544	5645524	$100?
5645564	5656348	$100 for two games Fuck off I was going to make a joke Nintendo is going to charge $180 for this because it's two games The truth is stranger than fiction
5666055	5670737	So yeah, when did The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered come out?
5670757	5672438	Was that like earlier this year?
5672818	5673959	I don't remember.
5673979	5676700	I thought it was a couple years ago at this point.
5678240	5678501	Is it?
5680101	5680421	Maybe.
5680942	5681462	Maybe not.
5681502	5682102	Oh, 2020.
5683463	5686144	So they're charging $50 for a four-year-old, five-year-old game?
5686164	5686864	Remastered.
5694935	5695295	Right.
5696156	5697077	Oh, OK.
5697137	5698077	Last was part two was 2020.
5698477	5700059	Well, when's the remastered?
5700219	5700679	Tell me.
5700699	5703421	It wasn't that long.
5703861	5705102	It was one or two years ago.
5705923	5706503	OK, OK.
5706543	5706743	Yeah.
5706803	5707223	Last year.
5707283	5708925	So January 19th.
5709125	5709365	OK.
5710005	5710526	Well, OK.
5710566	5711887	So at the very beginning of last year.
5712787	5713007	Yeah.
5713027	5713448	Last year.
5713548	5713828	So.
5715009	5715289	Still.
5717493	5726849	should be lower than $49.99 I guess we see where Nintendo got their inspiration well that game is always on sale if you're paying full price for those games either of them
5728217	5731880	Wait, because they always go on sale during PlayStation sales.
5731920	5738825	And then I'm almost positive those games show up on the PlayStation Plus service that, you know, if you want to pay the extra money for that.
5738865	5743708	But of course, you know, Nintendo, Sony will get that $100 out of you one way or another.
5744248	5745489	So there's that as well.
5746030	5751293	So, oh, I guess I'm trying to figure.
5751333	5753235	OK, so The Last of Us.
5755100	5757863	was Last of Us Part 1.
5759865	5764309	Okay, so that's not Last of Us Remastered because that gets confusing as well on top of all that.
5764970	5766691	It's Last of Us Part 1.
5769354	5770955	How much is that?
5771676	5772137	Probably...
5774127	5778068	$70 for the PlayStation 5 version.
5778088	5780729	See, Nintendo just got their inspiration from the last one.
5780749	5781830	But that came out in 2022.
5782750	5784270	I mean, for one, that should have never been $70.
5784470	5788852	Well, actually, the game originally came out in 2013 on the PlayStation 3.
5792953	5802216	Yeah, so the other reason it's a savings is because they're overcharging for the first one already, and they're going to keep it that way so it makes it like a savings, but it really is not.
5803618	5804720	Vote with your wallet, people.
5805161	5805963	Vote with your wallet.
5806123	5806965	So stupid.
5807614	5809155	By the way, you got to kick your camera again, Loki.
5811977	5813679	Let's open it up now for you all.
5813719	5819463	If you have anything you want to ask us, you can do that now in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
5819803	5821365	You could also give us a call if you want.
5821825	5826609	vognetwork.com slash discord is the way to join our Discord server and you can chat with us throughout the week.
5826629	5830432	We have some really good conversations sometimes in our chat.
5830472	5835335	Actually, more often than not in our different chat rooms over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
5835355	5837257	So I'd really encourage you to join if you want.
5837877	5840119	Um, so, uh, yeah, check that out.
5840159	5843621	And if you want to call in live tonight, you can join our green room and we'll take some of those.
5844022	5845963	Um, otherwise I'll take some of your chat comments.
5846263	5851027	By the way, we do not have any emails tonight, but I will put the email address out there one more time.
5851067	5855010	That's participate at orange lounge radio.com.
5855050	5859593	And I don't think we have, I, I, I've been trying to work blue sky into the rotation.
5860013	5864897	If you want to send us a message on blue sky, uh, you can tag us at orange lounge radio.com.
5865177	5867979	So we're verified by domain on Blue Sky.
5868339	5881648	So you just use orangelaundry.com if you want to tag us, which I will say a shout out to SSJ100 Matt, who was kind enough to post a clip from last week's show saying there are three classic blunders.
5882148	5882748	Thank you for watching!
5902961	5907443	to folks for clipping the show and doing those sorts of things.
5907783	5914406	That really goes a long way because, you know, people see that that maybe aren't necessarily subscribed and then they go, oh, this guy's real angry.
5914786	5915687	We want to go check him out.
5915907	5918488	So, yeah, clips are great.
5918848	5919448	Appreciate that.
5921829	5924911	Otherwise, we got a shout out from our pals at Game Buoy, which we appreciate as well.
5925331	5926552	We got a tag in that.
5926572	5931454	So, again, if you want to send us a blue sky message at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to do it.
5932645	5936339	Alright, well, I guess with that, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.
5936459	5938246	Actually, do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, before we do?
5938632	5964849	I was gonna mention it's it's not a huge thing like I know that like the way that the uh websites have been like making it seem like it that's the same um you may remember it was I think Don Matrick a while back said like you know hey if you can't afford you know an Xbox series console Xbox one is for you type of thing you remember that okay I can see why you thought that was a Don Matrick quote but he's been out of the gaming industry or at least the Xbox yeah for a long time okay
5965649	5966309	Well, then I don't care.
5966649	5967510	It's someone on the Xbox.
5985376	5995941	Doug Bowser said something recently that's kind of along the same lines to the Washington Post saying that we have an install base for the Switch of 150 million plus units.
5996301	6000383	We'll probably announce more on May 8th when we have our next earning call.
6000984	6002445	We want to keep those players engaged.
6002485	6005246	Not all of them may be ready to jump to Switch 2.
6005986	6009328	Which, the way people were phrasing it before was like, oh, he's saying the same thing.
6009368	6012229	Like, if you're too poor for the Switch 2, buy a Switch 1 type thing.
6012970	6013050	Um...
6014164	6026294	It doesn't sound like that's necessarily the case here, but yeah, essentially, I mean, if that is what he was trying to say, then no.
6027315	6030277	But it doesn't appear to be that.
6030818	6042728	It kind of reeks of let them eat cake, but I will give Doug Bowser's quote one crumb of credit, and that is that at least the Switch is being very well supported still over the next year.
6043228	6047552	We have a lot, you know, remember the direct we got the week before the Switch 2 was about the Switch 1.
6048273	6052657	We still have a shit ton of games coming out, including in 2026, that new Tomodachi Life.
6053178	6062767	So at least, and I will give him this crumb, at least, you know, if you were to buy a Switch tomorrow, you still have something that's being pretty well supported for another year.
6062948	6065911	At least, I'm sure indies are going to take that even further than that.
6066471	6068392	Yeah, Mike Def points out Rhythm Heaven as well.
6068432	6072753	And there's, you know, obviously they showed a lot of gay fantasy life is only about a month away.
6072773	6076975	You know, there's a lot of things that are still coming out on the original Switch that are going to make people very happy.
6078155	6083017	But again, I just, it just, would it kill you to drop the price of the Switch then?
6083077	6086618	Because that's usually what happens when the new phone comes out, the price of the old phone goes down.
6087628	6087968	Hmm.
6088469	6088649	Yeah.
6088669	6088729	Hmm.
6104150	6104450	All right.
6105131	6109213	Well, with that, I'm going to thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
6109253	6110674	Thank you for participating with our show.
6111034	6114056	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6114416	6115136	Tell a friend or two.
6115176	6119999	Help us spread the word because, again, yeah, we are that show where every gamer has a voice, and we want to have more voices in the room.
6120399	6125182	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts, YouTube, or Spotify goes an awful long way.
6125242	6127544	So please don't forget to click that five-star button.
6127564	6128324	We really appreciate it.
6128364	6129565	Tell a friend or two about the show.
6130265	6131246	Help us spread that word.
6131846	6134788	Social media, a little bleat or something goes a very long way as well.
6135328	6136229	We really appreciate that.
6136289	6144254	Since we do post every episode on YouTube, it's something very easy to link and put right into your show feed so people can just click play and check it out.
6144674	6145775	So we really appreciate all that.
6146355	6148556	We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.
6148576	6151417	DarkSakura will be back next week.
6152257	6155839	We'll see where the Nintendo Switch 2 pricing situation is at in a week.
6156239	6157759	Will we have a new pre-order date?
6158280	6159140	Will we have a price?
6159600	6160621	Honestly, probably not.
6161341	6164822	I think there's still too much instability going on in this whole thing.
6165342	6168744	I know if I was Nintendo, I would not want to commit to this still.
6169944	6171645	I think we're going to still be waiting another week.
6172145	6172545	You know what?
6172645	6174606	I say that and then guess what's going to happen Monday morning?
6176579	6177680	New press release comes out.
6177780	6178340	So we'll see.
6178400	6178720	We'll see.
6179440	6179660	All right.
6180061	6180741	Final thoughts.
6180861	6182322	Loki, we'll go to you with your final thought.
6183862	6188104	Final thought is, yeah, just go check out the channel if you haven't yet.
6188304	6189085	The YouTube channel.
6190125	6191466	LokiLR and YouTube.
6192489	6195653	And my final thought is I should get back into content creation outside this show.
6195673	6201480	I haven't done a YouTube or a personal stream in a long time, but it's because I've actually been... Actually, I looked at my thing today.
6201620	6205245	I have averaged 9,000 steps a day this week.
6205685	6208749	So yesterday I did a little less because of Oreo showing up.
6208809	6211672	I kind of did yesterday as a rest day, but otherwise I have done...
6212993	6240123	9,000 average stuff so it took at least 10,000 if not 11,000 every other day to make up for yesterday so today I think I'm up to about 12,000 um but it feels it feels great and I got my Pokemon not Pokemon Pikmin Bloom Badge although I've been playing a shit ton of Pokemon Go again like just having the Bluetooth while I walk is so I keep running out of Pokeballs thank god I have the new one that will let you throw great balls and let you throw ultra balls so I can stock up on the red ones too while I walk but um
6240583	6247105	Yeah, it's been good to be prioritizing walking again, but it has meant some of my other things have taken a hit.
6247526	6251187	And I guess on a personal note, I'm also very excited.
6252367	6253988	I'm starting a new job tomorrow.
6254768	6255408	Same company.
6255468	6256129	Congratulations.
6256149	6256449	Thank you.
6256509	6257089	Same company.
6257609	6281455	all that it's just it's a promotional opportunity uh really thrilled about it obviously I don't like to say a lot a lot because some people on the internet are a little crazy when it comes to um you know trying to find people uh so I don't like to say a lot a lot about my day job but I do really enjoy the environment where I work and I'm really excited to in fact my boss has listened to this show that should tell you a lot about what they're willing to put up with there
6284235	6290437	But I am going to be taking on a new role and I'm really excited about it and really happy and thrilled about it.
6290497	6291057	So thank you.
