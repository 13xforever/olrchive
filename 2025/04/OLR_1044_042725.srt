1
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:10,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back.

2
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:43,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,836
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here and live once again with episode number 1044 of our show for tonight, April the 27th of 2025.

6
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Last show of April, if you can believe it.

7
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:02,928
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

8
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:03,088
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

9
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:26,243
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I shouldn't be

10
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:59,265
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been nicknaming him as a sexy man.

11
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun fact, he is tied to video games.

12
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:07,911
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the voice of Grahatia in Final Fantasy XIV and still does it, even with all his other commitments, which is amazing.

13
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:09,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.

14
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:17,238
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also am going through physical therapy, so I have been doing physical therapy exercises this morning.

15
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:27,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I found out for my leg, while, yes, I had sprained my quad, I tore my hamstring.

16
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:29,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

17
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:38,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, clearly the muscle isn't collapsed or anything, but it's enough that it hurts.

18
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:41,755
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been doing physical therapy this morning as well.

19
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:42,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I went to dance.

20
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:44,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I have dance tomorrow night.

21
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:50,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I have physical therapy all week, and then I have dance on Wednesday.

22
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm literally now that person that says, I'm sorry, I can't.

23
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:55,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I have dance.

24
00:02:55,734 --> 00:03:01,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Just dance, it'll be okay Anyone?

25
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:08,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright It feels great though, I mean I'm sore afterwards, but I feel like

26
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:15,503
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I start getting the improvement that I wanted to get in ballet.

27
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:18,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I might be on my way to my goals.

28
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:25,313
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did... Character shoes are terrible in a story.

29
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:25,674
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.

30
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:29,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually feel a little bit similar to your journey, but with walking.

31
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:40,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know it's not as intense, but I've been really like even my little Apple Health summary thing because, you know, I wear the watch and stuff tells me like you've been getting more exercise these last few weeks and you haven't a long time.

32
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Your heart rate has been recovering better.

33
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:44,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, yeah, because I've been like walking like all the time.

34
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,044
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:08,568
[SPEAKER_07]: They should really be paying me with as much as I promote this game, but they don't.

36
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Next month they're doing classic console Pikmin.

37
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:17,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the Pikmin that you hatch from special seedlings will be like NES classic Nintendo.

38
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:20,296
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little pink one you can see with a Game & Watch themed.

39
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, well, this is the one where they convinced me to spend my money.

40
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to actually use it.

41
00:04:25,469 --> 00:04:28,510
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to actually play the games on them.

42
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just little decorative things.

43
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,790
[SPEAKER_07]: So they really don't mean anything.

44
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even opened the app since last week.

45
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, bummer.

46
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:40,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll see if I do.

47
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:52,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say, though, that just dancing today was about for an hour of dance, about 2,500 steps.

48
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

49
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:55,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

50
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Counting all my jumping and spinning and turning about?

51
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,144
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the most ridiculous thing ever

52
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:32,096
[SPEAKER_07]: It evolves into slightly bluer than the normal ones.

53
00:05:32,116 --> 00:05:33,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird, but anyway.

54
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,963
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous.

55
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:52,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to our chat, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except there was no Bobby Blackwolf tonight, so if you missed Bobby, he actually was not on this week.

56
00:05:52,716 --> 00:06:02,162
[SPEAKER_07]: He had a prior commitment and was unable to do tonight's show, but he will be back next week, and we'll look forward to seeing you an hour before us at 8 o'clock Eastern next week.

57
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:05,544
[SPEAKER_07]: S2100 Matt says, purple ice cream, ube ice cream.

58
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:12,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, have you ever had... I don't eat ice cream a lot anymore because, you know, of all my health stuff, but like... Ube, all the things.

59
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:19,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Ube, frozen yogurt, fro-yo, like which I still shouldn't eat because like LOL sugar, but once in a while as a treat.

60
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God, so good.

61
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:27,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Like seriously, I get excited when I see that flavor because, you know, you can never figure out what fucking flavor a yogurt store will have.

62
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,677
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I see Ube, I'm like, oh, this is it.

63
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:33,518
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.

64
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,241
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

65
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:46,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say of my favorite, I guess, non-traditional Western flavors, you put black sesame in front of me and I lose my shit.

66
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:47,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

67
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:53,833
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I also want to put a pin in this comment from PodCulture in chat talking about us.

68
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,894
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about Wicked and Jonathan Bailey.

69
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:59,716
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture said, Rob, but all the books he mauled in that number.

70
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:06,498
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, yeah, the way they do things in the movies is sometimes different from the books, is sometimes different from the stage show.

71
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's great.

72
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,339
[SPEAKER_07]: They all can be different.

73
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to put a pin in that because I want to come back to that because there's a lot, you know, we talk about not just gaming news, but like what gamers are talking about online online.

74
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

75
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I did for a little bit.

76
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:48,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to get too far into my gaming week, but oops.

77
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:50,235
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I explain it?

78
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:55,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It is really that they put the same fucking thing, the exact same thing you remember.

79
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:56,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Bugs and all.

80
00:07:56,917 --> 00:08:07,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you've been looking at the TikToks or the Instagram reels or your short form video thing of choice, you've probably been seeing here's the bug in the original game and here's the scroll in Remastered.

81
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:11,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's weird because as much as people bitch and moan about Bethesda and their bugs...

82
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:24,913
[SPEAKER_07]: This time it is strangely endearing because it is everything you remember wrapped in completely new, shiny, sparkling, beautiful, somehow four-dimensional wrapping paper.

83
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's really mind-blowing graphics.

84
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,037
[SPEAKER_07]: The graphics really are good.

85
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:32,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I played the opening segment where you escape the dungeon.

86
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everybody knows by now.

87
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Patrick Stewart's Real Septim character is there.

88
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:38,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And I noticed right away...

89
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,610
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if they got delayed from like something like it was supposed to come out like at their last announcement thing that they did.

92
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they would have said something.

93
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:42,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

94
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:42,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

95
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:57,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I joked on last week's show that this was going to be a big week for games because you have Elder Scrolls, you know, Oblivion remaster and then Claire Obscure Expedition 33 also on Game Pass.

96
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:58,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Oblivion Square Enix

97
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,541
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

98
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:41,968
[SPEAKER_07]: That's basically what I'm hearing about it from the internet, which I'm curious if any of you have played it in your thoughts in chat.

99
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:45,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded it, and that's about as far as I got.

100
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

101
00:10:45,851 --> 00:10:47,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't installed and all that good stuff.

102
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:59,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I chose to play Oblivion Remaster instead just because I was like, well, I probably won't play that one start to finish, but Claire Obscure I'll definitely want to sink into, and I want to make sure I have a bulk amount of time there.

103
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

104
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:06,286
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in chat talking about the Oblivion remaster saying, "...that Oblivion remaster won't be the last.

105
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Expect re-releases of this game for the years to come.

106
00:11:09,388 --> 00:11:12,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll come out on every platform known to man, every version imaginable."

107
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't disagree.

108
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,773
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a Switch 2 version is all but a certainty for this.

109
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:24,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming it will run, because it doesn't run on PlayStation 4 or the last series of Xbox...

110
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know, maybe Switch 2 isn't a guarantee, but if it can run it, I would say it would definitely happen.

111
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:45,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume, I know this sounds wacky, but y'all have to be thinking, I would assume they're going to do a Skyrim, which they've already done, but I think they're going to do a Skyrim in Unreal 5, I really do.

112
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:51,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that or like I would even see like a Fallout before that.

113
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:54,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, that's actually a really good call out.

114
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:59,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say especially if they could time the Fallout to go with the series that's on TV.

115
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:00,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

116
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:06,095
[SPEAKER_07]: SS2100 Matt in chat says Todd Howard slightly smirking at the thought of a new Skyrim.

117
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw pointing out and lots of mods too.

118
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the mods are already coming out for this game.

119
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them very controversial because...

120
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:15,058
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

121
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:33,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to talk about The Last of Us.

122
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going to spoil some things that happened in the second game.

123
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:57,044
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is five years old at this point.

124
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:01,466
[SPEAKER_07]: My assumption is if you're a gamer and you care about that series, you have played it at this point.

125
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:10,252
[SPEAKER_07]: So I apologize if I'm going to spoil a major plot point because it has to do with the TV show.

126
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:14,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do not want to be spoiled, I would encourage you to lower the volume for about three minutes.

127
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:18,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I will give you a hand signal on Twitch when I'm done.

128
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:22,089
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you on the podcast, you'll need to fast forward about three minutes.

129
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a minute to do this, okay?

130
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:24,452
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, here I go.

131
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to spoil this.

132
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:31,811
[SPEAKER_07]: So this week on The Last of Us on Max was the episode where Joel dies.

133
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:39,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was really surprised that they did that early on in the show because I thought they would milk this entire season with Pedro Pascal.

134
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:43,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe like that would be the big cliffhanger at the end and they would do something different next season.

135
00:13:44,017 --> 00:13:45,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Like next season would be Abby's point of view.

136
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,039
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever it is.

137
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, they spoiled it on the TV or spoiled it.

138
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:55,629
[SPEAKER_07]: They showed that sequence on the TV show this week which would be similar to the events early on in the game.

139
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,493
[SPEAKER_07]: This happens early on in the game to really like change up the tone.

140
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:00,634
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

141
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:05,097
[SPEAKER_07]: In the TV show, they told you Abby's motivations.

142
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:10,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They basically, you know, Abby comes out and says, it's something I haven't watched the show yet.

143
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting all of this fed through TikTok.

144
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And which is great.

145
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,924
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the new Red Wedding because it's people reacting to the death who have not played the games and are freaking the fuck out.

146
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:27,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody's like, finally, gamers have their Game of Thrones Red Wedding moment.

147
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:29,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to show, not say

148
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:51,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

149
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And so in the games, you don't find out Abby's motivations for like 10 more hours in the game.

150
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:07,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's actually a big, if you remember, people did not care for The Last of Us Part 2 because they hated Abby and you were forced to play as Abby for as long as the game.

151
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you found out.

152
00:15:10,215 --> 00:15:16,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Abby is somebody's daughter of somebody who was killed in the first game by Joel, and it's a cycle of revenge.

153
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:19,363
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically, she set her motivation out the gate.

154
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:29,492
[SPEAKER_07]: And an interesting online theory is that they did not want the actress to put up with the same bullshit that the actress who played Abby had to put up with in the games.

155
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, 2020, pandemic lockdowns, people were going through it online, and obviously...

156
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game is traumatic anyway.

157
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:03,108
[SPEAKER_07]: to get around that controversy.

158
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:09,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with the show doing its own narrative because also it's only two episodes in.

159
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,331
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a whole season left to go.

160
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,452
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know ultimately what this payoff may be.

161
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:19,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We know there are other characters now in the show that are not in the games and all this other stuff.

162
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:27,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how the show is going to give that same experience of playing the game from Abby's point of view and all that.

163
00:16:27,515 --> 00:16:28,676
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how that's going to go.

164
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's weird, but even though I don't really watch the show, this whole thing has made me want to watch it.

165
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, clearly this show is really fucking good.

166
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:51,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew that after the first season, but clearly this show... I need to make time because clearly this show, if it is inciting all of these opinions in the reaction video, clearly I need to be watching it.

167
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:53,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's... yeah.

168
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,870
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, there's an example of...

169
00:16:56,872 --> 00:17:02,854
[SPEAKER_07]: A different version of the property doing something completely different for its own artistic reasons.

170
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says Pedro Pascal was the show's biggest draw.

171
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to stick around after?

172
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:18,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that Pedro Pascal is still in the season, and it's probably through flashbacks, and we know that the show has done deeper dives on topics that weren't covered in the games.

173
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:23,979
[SPEAKER_07]: So Pedro Pascal will still be in the show, but I would expect that he's not in season three.

174
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So the show will have to, you know, but I don't know what they're going to do with season three now.

175
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It really feels like they're covering the events of the second game.

176
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:36,650
[SPEAKER_07]: So do they do the Game of Thrones thing and just kind of like go the direction they think the games are going in?

177
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do they allow the creative license?

178
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a third game coming out?

179
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:43,317
[SPEAKER_07]: We maybe will find that out summer.

180
00:17:45,483 --> 00:18:01,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see that a third game is announced summer comes out for holiday and then they're safe to translate that into a show next year but I think there's that very real possibility it's the Game of Thrones thing we all know he's never finishing the books we all know he is never finishing the books so yeah he is

181
00:18:03,257 --> 00:18:05,679
[SPEAKER_07]: from the great beyond if he doesn't step on it.

182
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,625
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'll have to channel it for somebody to write on stone tablets if he doesn't fucking hurry it up.

183
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:20,529
[SPEAKER_07]: But they had the outline or whatever to do the show off of, so it'll be interesting.

184
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:21,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, all right.

185
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people that may have muted this want us to move on.

186
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:26,753
[SPEAKER_07]: We have other topics to get into, so there's my signal.

187
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:31,276
[SPEAKER_07]: It's safe to listen again, although all of you in chat were spoiling it anyway, so whatever.

188
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:33,037
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, the game is five years old.

189
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:38,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I feel if you're very passionate about it, you probably have figured it out at this point.

190
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and you had a week on the show.

191
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's move on.

192
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to get into other kickoff topics for tonight.

193
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously the big thing going on in the gaming world has to do with the Switch 2 pre-orders.

194
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:54,389
[SPEAKER_07]: They happened this last week, for better or for worse.

195
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people, I think, had some mixed experiences.

196
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:00,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, I'm pretty sure you didn't try for one.

197
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You kind of made your...

198
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:03,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really interested right now.

199
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:05,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

200
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:08,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But Loki, I saw a bleep from you on Blue Sky.

201
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:09,738
[SPEAKER_07]: You did try for this, right?

202
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:12,079
[SPEAKER_07]: How did that experience go for you with the preordering of Switch 2?

203
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,522
[SPEAKER_01]: It was messy because like there was a lot of this.

204
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:20,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously we expected the sites and everything to like

205
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,377
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

206
00:19:41,863 --> 00:20:02,567
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be able to get it into the cart and you'd be able to like put all your payment information in all that stuff and you hit go and then it's like oh sold out it's like okay but it's in the cart you can't you know how's it selling out already um and then I managed to get everything finally the process to a certain point and then they wiped all the carts

207
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I was like, okay, well, this sucks.

208
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:12,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to try through Walmart and Best Buy.

209
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So Best Buy puts you in a queue that you have to wait.

210
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:15,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

211
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:43,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it just waited it never did anything beyond that Walmart was a little crazier too same thing where essentially you could put it in the cart hit you know process pay or whatever and they would just error out and they kept doing that back and forth and they would say one sold out one's in stock the bundles sold out the individuals in stock finally went back to Target again because it's like oh hey there's more available now and I finally managed to

212
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:50,705
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in the cart on my PC and I was able to process the transaction on the app on my phone.

213
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:57,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did finally get one, but it was such a hassle.

214
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:01,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It took like two hours when I was like right there at the start.

215
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:02,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it wasn't there.

216
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got in a couple minutes late.

217
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was there to the second.

218
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:06,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

219
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was my mistake with Target.

220
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Target had my wrong address.

221
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:40,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you make sure all that stuff's ready to go prior to actually launching.

222
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,814
[SPEAKER_01]: That should help with some of that stuff because it was a mess.

223
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,135
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all over the place.

224
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,936
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, finally, I did get one.

225
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:53,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did see that some people did manage to get one earlier on the night, but then had their orders canceled.

226
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:55,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, mine has not been canceled.

227
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:55,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm

228
00:21:57,472 --> 00:22:02,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty safe now that it's about, you know, a week out that probably not going to cancel it, you know.

229
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:10,360
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the other thing, too, with the Walmart or the Target or one of those, that estimated delivery date kept getting pushed out, out, out, out.

230
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:19,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's one of the things I know that we're going to be talking about is that, you know, Nintendo's like, well, we can't promise that you're going to have your console day one type thing.

231
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:21,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

232
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, don't really care.

233
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,068
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the first week.

234
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:24,608
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.

235
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:25,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

236
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:29,089
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just glad I was able to get one.

237
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like my story is a little bit less dramatic just because I was able to get through on Best Buy.

238
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So the biggest problem with Best Buy is that it didn't go live right at 9 for us on the West Coast.

239
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:42,794
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't go live right at 9.

240
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:46,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't go live until like 9.24 or something like that.

241
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:50,076
[SPEAKER_07]: It was at least a good 20 minutes after the fact that it finally went live.

242
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:54,618
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just kind of sitting there reloading and then all of a sudden the button's available and then the button puts you in another queue.

243
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

244
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: All things considered, it ended up being pretty low drama for me.

245
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:23,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, other people, my understanding is it was not low drama.

246
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:27,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching on our Discord over at vognetwork.com.

247
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,358
[SPEAKER_07]: People were sharing stories.

248
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:32,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And at some point, the Best Buy queue kicked a bunch of people out.

249
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know Bobby got kicked out, which...

250
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

251
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

252
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:57,317
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the weird thing.

253
00:23:57,577 --> 00:24:01,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually feel like all things considered, it went better than I expected it to.

254
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:05,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that sounds especially fucked up if you're one of the people out there that didn't get one.

255
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,840
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very sorry.

256
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the system's being screwy.

257
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:13,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, everybody's always like, the retailers need to put more power into it.

258
00:24:13,443 --> 00:24:14,543
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to put more power into it.

259
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:23,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like, it's kind of like the reality is it's not that easy where they can just turn the graphics up on level three or bring in the extra servers for one night type of thing.

260
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:24,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

261
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:26,828
[SPEAKER_07]: They're never going to get this right.

262
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:27,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Never, ever.

263
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,251
[SPEAKER_07]: The only real solution is for this to be available at more retailers.

264
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:35,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of surprised Amazon wasn't one of the retailers.

265
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:39,617
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I guess, you know, Amazon, Nintendo have history or whatever.

266
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:40,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It is what it is.

267
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:44,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rinmari in chat says, any high demand thing will be like this always.

268
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:44,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's it.

269
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,963
[SPEAKER_07]: OSG100Matt was also one of the people that got kicked out when Bobby got kicked out.

270
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So a bunch of people got kicked out at some point, which is...

271
00:24:50,225 --> 00:25:18,480
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, annoying So yeah, it's just That's what it is And then apparently the GameStop thing For people that did that went pretty well Because that ended up being the next day So you had people that went in store And I know Shane was sharing his experience with me Because he was the only one I knew that went And he said they had like Between the two types of consoles Between the bundle and the non-bundle They had like 80 consoles to pre-order And there were only like 30 people in line

272
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:26,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So, sounds like a lot of the GameStop people, I don't know, but again, he's in a very rural kind of area.

273
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how those of you like in the Bay Area where tech is very popular, I don't know, the stories are probably very different.

274
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:35,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah.

275
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, it sounds like, you know, again, I was expecting it to be a lot worse.

276
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:46,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expecting it to be like NES Classic or, you know, other types of Nintendo scarce things to be bad.

277
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like it went better.

278
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is the other interesting thing.

279
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: So Alan pre-ordered one as well because he kind of wants one.

280
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, you know, yeah, I want a Switch 2.

281
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:56,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we both get one?

282
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:57,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, all right, sure, why not?

283
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:58,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

284
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:05,886
[SPEAKER_07]: He was not able to get it because I think the credit card on Walmart or something was not working.

285
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,027
[SPEAKER_07]: We recently switched bank accounts.

286
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:15,429
[SPEAKER_07]: And so every time we were trying to process, it would come as a text message going, is this really you?

287
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:18,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, that even happened to me the first time on Best Buy.

288
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God Best Buy held it for an extra 10 minutes while I could reply, yes, verify or whatever, and then get that through.

289
00:26:24,491 --> 00:26:27,292
[SPEAKER_07]: But the interesting thing with Alan, he was not able to get one.

290
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:31,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday night, and then it was like, all right, well, whatever, you know, at least we got one.

291
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:35,256
[SPEAKER_07]: But he got one last night through Walmart.

292
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:42,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the news came out on social media or somewhere that Walmart suddenly had extras in stock.

293
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:47,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And we think the speculation is it's people who canceled or did something.

294
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:49,383
[SPEAKER_07]: What, you want to tell the story, Alan?

295
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:49,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

296
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:51,322
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

297
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:22,516
[SPEAKER_00]: with Target, it wouldn't save my shipping address and then because it's like, oh, you've never ordered from us before and I made sure the credit card number obviously was saved beforehand because why would I raw dog it with my hand?

298
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:39,343
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it finally popped up and said verify your credit card number I put in the CVV2 on the back of the card because that's normally what you have to do for verification but no it was asking for the whole number so I put in the CVV2 and it gave Rob a fraud notification

299
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:44,275
[SPEAKER_00]: and I realized, oh, it was literally asking for all 16 digits over again.

300
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:46,336
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my shot on Target.

301
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:47,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So I blew it.

302
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:49,018
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one time I went through.

303
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:50,639
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

304
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not supposed to be shopping at Target anyway.

305
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

306
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:57,224
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no ethical, basically Best Buy except I'm sure they do something shady.

307
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:57,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

308
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:58,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

309
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,611
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumor was... So I gave up.

310
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:03,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once Rob... I was mostly the backup for Rob.

311
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:06,475
[SPEAKER_00]: If Rob didn't get his at Best Buy, I was supposed to get one.

312
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:08,436
[SPEAKER_00]: That way he could get what he wants.

313
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:09,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's always the most important thing.

314
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:10,698
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

315
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:19,786
[SPEAKER_00]: It was CheapAssGamer on BlueSky said, Walmart's doing checkouts right now.

316
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,327
[SPEAKER_00]: The cart works in Walmart.

317
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:23,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw that on BlueSky.

318
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:23,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh shit.

319
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:25,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the app because the app is quicker.

320
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went right through.

321
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Add to cart, credit card, got a receipt.

322
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's probably all the people whose credit cards declined.

323
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:36,248
[SPEAKER_07]: You stole one of their Switch 2s.

324
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:36,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.

325
00:28:55,475 --> 00:29:09,450
[SPEAKER_00]: and I guess I snagged one of those and I told a friend in Chicago and all he did was click the add to cart once and it said this is a high ticket item so we're busy right now and he gave up and if you kept doing it

326
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:10,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

327
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:10,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

328
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:10,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

329
00:29:10,975 --> 00:29:11,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

330
00:29:35,782 --> 00:29:39,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well thank you for sharing the story, Alan, how that happened, because I wasn't home when that all went down.

331
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:42,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about this all through text message, so yeah.

332
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:43,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

333
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:45,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, thank you for the Alan cameo.

334
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:45,653
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

335
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:45,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.

336
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:50,437
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so yeah, that was my Switch 2 experience.

337
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:57,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Loki, you have some kind of like follow-ups to this whole, you know, what was going on online.

338
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's not anything too shocking.

339
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, guess what?

340
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:05,687
[SPEAKER_01]: People are selling their pre-orders on eBay.

341
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:09,869
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a thing already, of course, because Scalper's gonna scalp.

342
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:11,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, I'm gonna be honest.

343
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:20,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Until I realized Alan actually wanted to switch two for himself, we did kind of get, we were like, well, if we end up with two, we could always resell one.

344
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:26,998
[SPEAKER_07]: But I always would have, and I swear, I always would have, if a friend of mine needed it, I would have flipped it for the sticker price.

345
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:33,261
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have turned it over to a friend first, but then if no friends wanted it, I would have been like, well, maybe I'll be a bitch.

346
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:34,142
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

347
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:40,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's that.

348
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:56,881
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, is Nintendo has updated the website about pre-ordering a Switch 2 console, saying that there's very high demand and that they're not guaranteeing that all consoles will be delivered by the June 5th launch date.

349
00:30:57,421 --> 00:31:05,345
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I think, on the actual Nintendo website with that whole invite process, which I still haven't gotten an email on, so I don't know if that's still a thing or not.

350
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:24,535
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, with very few.

351
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like there's not going to be a ton of people left for that Nintendo wave, but I guess maybe that's where the scalpers fuck everything up.

352
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

353
00:31:32,658 --> 00:31:32,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

354
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:39,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, obviously they're just kind of trying to like set the expectations that, hey,

355
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:41,564
[SPEAKER_01]: There's high demand on this.

356
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:46,466
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either going to deliver late or there may not have enough.

357
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:53,771
[SPEAKER_01]: They're saying that we've received an extremely large number of applications, approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone.

358
00:31:54,271 --> 00:32:02,415
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this number far exceeds our expectations and far exceeds the number of Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo store on June 5th.

359
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:27,991
[SPEAKER_01]: um they said we expect that a significant number of customers will be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow uh which would have been three days ago so i don't know if everybody heard on my nintendo who's going to get a console or not but that apparently already happened um we'll see i don't know it's hard to say um

360
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:35,846
[SPEAKER_01]: And then... I mean, this always happens, so I'm not surprised.

361
00:32:36,446 --> 00:32:44,069
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop is accused of forcing customers to buy bundles.

362
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't that long ago that I remember the Switch 1.

363
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,371
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of these shenanigans happen before, yeah.

364
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:54,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens almost every console launch, that they are...

365
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it, and I get it.

366
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,283
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not GameStop policy.

367
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:05,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Overwhelmingly, customers had a positive experience, according to GameStop.

368
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,704
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of factors here.

369
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:20,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, if it's in store, we don't know what the employees are being incentivized on or what is being said there because it could be a whole toothpaste thing.

370
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:22,439
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's online, we've seen this before.

371
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done this forced bundle stuff with the Xbox 360 and stuff.

372
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:36,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, they're not making any sort of margin on these consoles at all, probably losing some money, so it makes sense from a business perspective to do this, but it still sucks.

373
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:39,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

374
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of people, a lot of people that, even though they don't buy it as a bundle, they buy the Mario Kart version and say, and then they're like, okay, you know what, while I'm here, I'm going to get a camera and I'm going to get a pro controller.

375
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,620
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's forced on them, they don't like that.

376
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,121
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you not getting?

377
00:33:56,161 --> 00:34:01,566
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not getting is the friggin' $85 official Nintendo carrying case for it.

378
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,408
[SPEAKER_01]: $85 for a carrying case?

379
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:05,150
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty, yeah, that's pretty ice.

380
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:11,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I get it, the stuff that, you know, has electronics in it, and that being expensive, but something that is essentially fabric...

381
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,333
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I paying for?

382
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:16,915
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that much of a premium item.

383
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,037
[SPEAKER_07]: The Steam Deck comes with one, just heads up.

384
00:34:20,077 --> 00:34:21,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a nice, solid carrying case.

385
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:22,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it.

386
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,863
[SPEAKER_01]: That $85 carrying case is one that can hold the actual dock and everything as well.

387
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:29,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, big deal.

388
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:32,266
[SPEAKER_01]: They have another one that is half the price.

389
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:33,287
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still $40.

390
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:36,309
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still twice as much as the third-party cases.

391
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:39,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.

392
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:41,033
[SPEAKER_01]: $85 seems awfully high.

393
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:42,394
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know...

394
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,466
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:37,668
[SPEAKER_07]: were able to, except of course there's just a few people that didn't so of course I feel bad for those folks but I'm hoping that Nintendo wave will sort of fill in the rest of the folks that still really want one and even the people that missed the first go around so that's the hope so we'll see but it definitely seems like Nintendo has more product out there than they have with other consoles previously so it's come a long way from the days of camping out for a Nintendo Wii and Jamie bribing her way to the front of the line with Krispy Kreme and being recognized from the internet

396
00:35:39,673 --> 00:36:03,496
[SPEAKER_07]: there's that all right that'll never happen anymore us no not anymore no it was it was different in 2006 when like podcasts were still like a very new thing and very few people did them and that people thought it was a very cost prohibitive thing it was very different you know no there was a I'm sure I've told this story on the show before or Jamie both um some guy in line some guy in line was listening to our show while waiting in line

397
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:05,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, it's you!

398
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:17,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that happened to us once.

399
00:36:17,878 --> 00:36:18,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me.

400
00:36:18,859 --> 00:36:22,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie and I were at an arcade together and a person working there recognized us by our voice.

401
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:31,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I got invited to a DDR tournament in Metairie when it turned out I was going to be going to Alabama.

402
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:32,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up going.

403
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:33,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

404
00:36:33,787 --> 00:36:35,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, yeah, that would never happen anymore.

405
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:36,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

406
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,770
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be surprised.

407
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It could happen.

408
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:40,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it could.

409
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It could.

410
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:42,593
[SPEAKER_04]: But it would not.

411
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:42,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

412
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

413
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:49,553
[SPEAKER_07]: No, now, especially locally, once in a blue moon, it will be, why do you look familiar?

414
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:51,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll be like, have you ever seen a show at the Colonial?

415
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:52,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

416
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So once in a while, once in a while.

417
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

418
00:36:57,937 --> 00:36:58,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Brad.

419
00:36:58,697 --> 00:36:59,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

420
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:00,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I couldn't help it.

421
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Rocky.

422
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Not pod culture, Brad.

423
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:03,719
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Rocky thing.

424
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

425
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:09,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gorilla72 in chat says, I felt bad.

426
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't really want one and got one.

427
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,192
[SPEAKER_07]: LOL.

428
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:13,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, don't feel bad.

429
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:15,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, you know.

430
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Just give it to me.

431
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, give it to somebody who wants one.

432
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:23,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, if you do have a friend that maybe was really trying for one that couldn't get one, you could really be a lifesaver.

433
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,424
[SPEAKER_07]: But also at the end of the day, maybe you'll get it and you'll be like, eh, I do kind of want one of these, you know.

434
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:29,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

435
00:37:30,685 --> 00:37:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be a hero.

436
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:36,308
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S says, Rob, don't forget that one time at KatsuCon where that vendor said, you're Rob Roberts from Originals Radio.

437
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it happens once in a while.

438
00:37:37,909 --> 00:37:40,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's random.

439
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:41,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It's random.

440
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:42,672
[SPEAKER_04]: John's Incredible Pizza?

441
00:37:42,772 --> 00:37:43,192
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

442
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:44,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one I was talking about.

443
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:45,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when we were at the pizza place.

444
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:46,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

445
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,780
[SPEAKER_04]: But that happened while we were doing it in line.

446
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:51,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

447
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:52,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the thing.

448
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you and I were bickering in line.

449
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:59,024
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say bickering, I mean like Rose and Blanche on the Golden Girls, not like actual bickering.

450
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:03,026
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like sibling stuff.

451
00:38:04,227 --> 00:38:04,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, all right.

452
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:10,590
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get into our gaming week and talk about how was your gaming week and the types of games that you've been playing this week.

453
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we're getting into that segment, so I see DJ Ranma S is in chat now.

454
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:19,434
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

455
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:40,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what this is.

456
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:46,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to open this and see what the hell this is while Jamie's talking so that we don't have dead air.

457
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:47,439
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have the box.

458
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already scissored the box open.

459
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:54,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I just haven't opened the... Not that kind.

460
00:38:54,343 --> 00:38:57,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not opened the flaps to dig into the box.

461
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, so I'll talk about my gaming week.

462
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:12,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some of the Blood Moon event for Dead by Daylight, and I guess I'm going to try to finish the Tome.

463
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,177
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

464
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really been super hyper about wanting to play it lately, but I've done Palia, I have a third property, and I am trying to do more of the decorating glitches.

465
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:53,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I've learned quite a bit about doing those glitches too so I think it'll work out really nicely and then I've also been playing Mass Effect I enjoyed that I did not play any Monster Hunter Wilds this week I just didn't feel like it I didn't want to deal with the confusing controls but other than that I'm still doing I beat my score again in Fruit Mountain this time I hit over 8000 points

466
00:39:56,341 --> 00:40:19,015
[SPEAKER_04]: which I mean for me kind of a hard thing but yeah that's about what I've been playing and doing just those things they are fun and I know what I like and those are what I like oh I did though pick up Resident Evil 4 remake for Steam because it's on sale right now it's like 50% off love it

467
00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:24,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm freaking out a little bit at what's in this box.

468
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:26,038
[SPEAKER_07]: So you ready to see what's in the box?

469
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:30,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show you the first thing I saw as I was opening the box.

470
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:30,602
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

471
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:35,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

472
00:40:36,846 --> 00:40:37,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what this is?

473
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:39,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what Geass is?

474
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:47,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the graphic environment operating system for the Commodore 64.

475
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:51,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you remember how I said this box is very heavy?

476
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:52,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

477
00:40:58,891 --> 00:40:59,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he get you a Commodore 64?

478
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

479
00:41:05,777 --> 00:41:07,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the silence, folks, but I'm unwrapping.

480
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:11,621
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a yellowed, grotesque...

481
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:15,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming still working.

482
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:16,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Commodore 64.

483
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,470
[SPEAKER_07]: That is incredible.

484
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:24,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma, don't spend your money on this kind of stuff for me.

485
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:25,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

486
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:27,881
[SPEAKER_07]: This is wild.

487
00:41:27,901 --> 00:41:30,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, yeah, I've mentioned on the show before...

488
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,006
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:41:50,526 --> 00:41:50,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

490
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: There's assorted software in here.

491
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Ranma says my friend was going to toss it.

492
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:02,500
[SPEAKER_07]: That's... Okay, so you didn't have to pay a lot of money, hopefully.

493
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,060
[SPEAKER_07]: My goodness.

494
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

495
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:03,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

496
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:04,362
[SPEAKER_07]: This is incredible.

497
00:42:04,742 --> 00:42:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: What's in this other?

498
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:06,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this like disk drives?

499
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:08,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

500
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to pull it out of the box because that's the heavy part.

501
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:20,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fucking Commodore 64 disk drive in there.

502
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:26,204
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm not going to pull everything out of the box because I want to be able to set this later without messing up the floor in my room.

503
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's assorted software in here too.

504
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:29,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is...

505
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:35,752
[SPEAKER_07]: This is incredible, because if I can find discs, I don't know if you can find five and a quarter discs.

506
00:42:36,172 --> 00:42:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you have to order them online or something, but I should be able to write Commodore 64 software to it or something.

507
00:42:43,078 --> 00:42:43,859
[SPEAKER_07]: That's incredible.

508
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:46,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Ranma, thank you so much.

509
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you that Amazon has some still somewhere.

510
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, don't they make ultra-thin drives?

511
00:42:56,735 --> 00:42:57,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably do.

512
00:42:57,516 --> 00:43:01,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's probably like other types of peripherals now for sure.

513
00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:03,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Bobby stays up on that a little more than I do, so I'll have to see.

514
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:08,066
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm sure online enthusiast community for sure.

515
00:43:08,426 --> 00:43:12,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I just have to figure out where I'm going to set this up or to what CRT TV.

516
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:15,132
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll figure it out.

517
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:15,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll figure it out.

518
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:16,173
[SPEAKER_07]: There's converters.

519
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:19,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember playing a lot of Millipede on that at my –

520
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:25,751
[SPEAKER_04]: She's technically my step-aunt, but I called her my cousin.

521
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:26,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

522
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:28,513
[SPEAKER_04]: But we played a lot of Villapede.

523
00:43:28,813 --> 00:43:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

524
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I see her comment in Chad DarkSakura.

525
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It was my birthday, but Rob got the presents.

526
00:43:34,556 --> 00:43:35,876
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair... I was teasing.

527
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:36,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're teasing.

528
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're teasing.

529
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: But to be fair, everybody knows what a hardcore Commodore 64 enthusiast I was.

530
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:44,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's wild.

531
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's... Actually, Rama, I have not seen...

532
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:49,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan, have you overheard what was in this box?

533
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:50,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that wild?

534
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:51,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

535
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:56,467
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have not seen one of the original, original 64s in a long time.

536
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:57,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Ours broke.

537
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we actually had a 64C.

538
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,911
[SPEAKER_07]: There was like a white reprinting of them.

539
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Think like a PlayStation Pro or something.

540
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:06,533
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a white reprinting of them that looked very different.

541
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,534
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the one that we had more often.

542
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:11,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen an original, original Commodore 64 like in a very long time.

543
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:14,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's wild.

544
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:15,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Rama.

545
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:15,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

546
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:17,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do appreciate that.

547
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:24,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent him a picture earlier this week of Cheddar sitting on top of the box going, Cheddar wants whatever's in here.

548
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:25,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it chicken?

549
00:44:27,236 --> 00:44:27,516
Funny.

550
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:28,936
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

551
00:44:30,396 --> 00:44:31,296
[SPEAKER_07]: They can have the box.

552
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:32,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheddar and Oreo can have the box.

553
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:33,557
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

554
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:35,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into other gaming weeks.

555
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:38,298
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry for the disruption, but also not sorry.

556
00:44:38,638 --> 00:44:39,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

557
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:43,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I mainly just played Minecraft.

558
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of... It was busy, but not like...

559
00:44:47,242 --> 00:44:48,183
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things.

560
00:44:48,903 --> 00:45:00,272
[SPEAKER_01]: We updated our server to 121.5, and so that was a major pain in the ass last night because it just didn't want to... It's still not functioning quite right.

561
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:02,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps resetting chunks and stuff, which is annoying.

562
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:05,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we got it all worked out now.

563
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:13,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And then outside of that, I've been just mainly prepping my brand new retro...

564
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:15,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Emulation Handheld.

565
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:31,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see it, but it's a little device that runs Android and has cool Hall Effects Analog 6 and basically set up like a modern controller.

566
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing will run everything up to the Switch.

567
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:37,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do Switch emulation.

568
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,561
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how underpowered the Switch is!

569
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:43,703
[SPEAKER_01]: That this little Android device can also emulate Switch games.

570
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have been working on getting together a ROM set for all of that stuff.

571
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:53,467
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fun.

572
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:55,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but here's the best part.

573
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the goal.

574
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:01,249
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that I would love to be able to accomplish.

575
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:13,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I saw a video online of somebody running on a GPD2, which I think is a really underpowered... I think it's Intel Atom or something like that.

576
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,693
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little PC, micro PC thing.

577
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:18,814
[SPEAKER_01]: It was running Final Fantasy XI.

578
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:26,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it was running it connected to a private server.

579
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:51,416
[SPEAKER_01]: that was also running on that device so I'm like if that thing can do that then I can get that thing to do that um in fact actually they do have PC emulators um that can run on that that are capable of running the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5 so if it can run Grand Theft Auto 5 it should be able to handle Final Fantasy 11 at least that's my thought process here um

580
00:46:51,856 --> 00:46:54,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to put, actually, Grand Theft Auto 4 on there if I could.

581
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:57,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm ready to see what I can do with this thing.

582
00:46:57,942 --> 00:46:59,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how I can max this out.

583
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:05,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a 1TB card that's going to go into it, so it's a lot of room for things.

584
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:06,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

585
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:06,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

586
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:07,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

587
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:07,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

588
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:10,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

589
00:47:10,273 --> 00:47:11,034
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week.

590
00:47:11,914 --> 00:47:13,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about the mobile games already.

591
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I already talked a little bit about Elder Scrolls IV Remastered.

592
00:47:16,175 --> 00:47:17,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play a little bit of that.

593
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:23,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely want to do a little more, although I got to get to the other new stuff that came out last week.

594
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:26,577
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other things I've been playing quite a bit of is Final Fantasy XIV.

595
00:47:26,737 --> 00:47:27,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, what a shock.

596
00:47:27,698 --> 00:47:30,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a new patch that came out last week.

597
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:35,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a mini patch, but it was for a feature that they had announced for this expansion that I was really looking forward to.

598
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Cosmic Exploration.

599
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:45,427
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they first, first announced it, I thought it was going to be similar to Island Sanctuary, which was in last expansion's content, which I really enjoyed.

600
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:46,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was really excited.

601
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:49,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, they're going to let us like build and terraform like a planet now.

602
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,014
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it actually didn't turn out like that.

603
00:47:52,114 --> 00:47:53,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little more...

604
00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:54,375
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

605
00:48:10,425 --> 00:48:10,906
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

606
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:41,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So this mode is really geared towards that to give the people that really enjoy the crafting and gathering something to kind of pour themselves into as there is like a server-based competition to build things for the moon.

607
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:50,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a throwback to like the fucking – what was that old school WoW thing that everybody had to turn in the wool to open up the tomb of –

608
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Anub'Arak?

609
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:51,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that it?

610
00:48:52,174 --> 00:48:52,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something?

611
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

612
00:48:54,175 --> 00:48:56,015
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those early, early things, like the raid.

613
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:57,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, everybody on the server had to raid.

614
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:58,916
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like that.

615
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: You're building across servers, the different things contributing to it.

616
00:49:02,657 --> 00:49:07,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But the guild lev system was something that was in the original game that they kind of went away from.

617
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:08,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Guild levs are basically...

618
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:10,020
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

619
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:59,889
[SPEAKER_07]: and put that into this so that it it's not like you're doing the same type of crafting over and over it's different from foundation because you don't have to go get the materials then craft them you actually are given them and you have to kind of craft everything it's kind of it's kind of interesting um I don't want to bore those of you that don't play the game they also put crafting fates into it which I thought was really kind of clever you don't actually like furiously craft things but you sort of have a different mechanic that you use um so it's neat so yeah

620
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:05,913
[SPEAKER_07]: It just goes to show there's more in the game than just the battle stuff, and I think it's kind of neat that they put this whole different mode in it.

621
00:50:06,353 --> 00:50:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: That all being said, I don't know if there's a lot of longevity in this, but if you're into crafting and gathering, there is a bit of a grind for a really good, like if you're a miner like I am, and you want to get the best pickaxe in the game, the relic pickaxe, you can grind in this mode and you'll get it.

622
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:26,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So the rewards are worth it, but it's just going to be very grindy.

623
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:29,809
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have roulette wheels that give you some pretty cool prizes, though.

624
00:50:30,469 --> 00:50:39,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some orchestrations from a lot of the songs people really wanted from the last expansion, like a new mount and a couple new pets, you know, cute things like that that people always love to collect.

625
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And they finally came out with some new dye colors that are also in this.

626
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:47,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, a little reason for people to keep going.

627
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:49,810
[SPEAKER_07]: But that made up the bulk of my gaming week.

628
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I did play some games with friends.

629
00:50:53,032 --> 00:50:57,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing, you know, a little bit of Tetris because I could always... I also played Grandmaster 4 this week.

630
00:50:57,595 --> 00:50:58,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I always forget.

631
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I play that on my Steam Deck.

632
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,877
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably the most played game on my Steam Deck right now.

633
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:05,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I played F-Zero GX recently.

634
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it in emulator and it looked better, but then my friend also got his old GameCube and hooked it up and we were playing F-Zero GX and that was really cool.

635
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:13,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

636
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:18,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Jamie, do you know what I played this week on a PlayStation?

637
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:20,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Rival Schools.

638
00:51:21,673 --> 00:51:21,913
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

639
00:51:22,073 --> 00:51:23,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I thought you'd get a kick out of that.

640
00:51:25,076 --> 00:51:26,618
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's it.

641
00:51:26,658 --> 00:51:27,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for my gaming week.

642
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:32,705
[SPEAKER_07]: We can move on and get into some gaming news and what else is going on in the gaming world.

643
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:34,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we will start with you.

644
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:39,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough, I was just talking about my retro game handheld I have.

645
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:41,343
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a Retro Pocket Flip 2.

646
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:50,265
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other major players in the retro emulation space is Amberdick.

647
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:55,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And Amberdick actually has just announced that they are going to stop all US shipments

648
00:51:56,687 --> 00:52:12,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Over tariffs, which makes sense because there's a ridiculous percentage of tariffs for products coming from China and essentially that it's going to make it not affordable for them to actually import it.

649
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:16,762
[SPEAKER_01]: We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S.

650
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:23,264
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse so they still have product in the United States so that people can buy without tariffs.

651
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:34,407
[SPEAKER_01]: But anything beyond that, once they sell through that, they're not going to be shipping anymore back to the United States until the whole tariff situation goes away, which...

652
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:36,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a few years from now.

653
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:07,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're going to see a massive impact with that, like store shelves being bare and prices going up and all that type of stuff.

654
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,033
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst is yet to come.

655
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: For a lot over here.

656
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:13,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

657
00:53:13,918 --> 00:53:15,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress could end this tomorrow.

658
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:16,642
[SPEAKER_07]: They could?

659
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:16,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

660
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

661
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unfortunate.

662
00:53:21,971 --> 00:53:33,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing to be talking about video games, but I think there's a lot of things people are looking for, you know, a lot of household items and household electronics that people are going to be a little bit shocked or they're going to suddenly disappear and they're going to be like, how did this happen?

663
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:46,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, and that's why these devices, piracy aside, are great because essentially it's kind of an all-in-one type thing and it's somewhat affordable to be able to emulate your systems.

664
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:51,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you can get, I mean, like I said, this one right here, which was, you know, about 200 bucks.

665
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:54,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

666
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:37,575
[SPEAKER_01]: people are gonna go that route and then on top of that you look at like you know other games like I understand that Oblivion you know being remastered re-released or whatever again um it still wasn't a $70 game it could have been but they charged you know $49.99 for it uh Claire Obscura uh same thing you know that wasn't a full price game either and it's excellent so like

667
00:54:39,187 --> 00:54:41,109
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other options.

668
00:54:41,169 --> 00:55:02,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, when there's a bunch of games coming out for $80, $90, and those games come out unfinished, or they're just not that great, bad writing, whatever the case may be, everyone's going to start going back towards indie again, where the prices are reasonable, and hopefully the market then settles back down, but I don't know.

669
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I kind of agree with you that the bubbles, like we're going to see another video game crash, but not in the same way that it crashed in 84.

670
00:55:11,322 --> 00:55:18,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to crash for the AAAs, but not for, excuse me, I should say it's going to crash for the quadruple A's.

671
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:20,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for Nintendo.

672
00:55:20,774 --> 00:55:23,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo will always be immune to this behavior.

673
00:55:24,136 --> 00:55:37,040
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think a lot of these big budget games are, you know, they're not going to sell to the extent that, you know... And I'm even curious, you know, yeah, sure, the Switch 2's kind of sold through and sold out real quick, but...

674
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,202
[SPEAKER_07]: How many was that at the end of the day?

675
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:43,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sitting here giving Nintendo a lot of credit going, well, they must have had more to go through and they got it right.

676
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, or was there maybe actually less people going for it?

677
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,315
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't feel like it based on social media, but I also follow a lot of gamers on social media.

678
00:55:51,975 --> 00:55:52,956
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

679
00:55:53,277 --> 00:55:54,218
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to tell.

680
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:54,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to tell.

681
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:56,312
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

682
00:55:56,772 --> 00:56:00,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Loki brought up Oblivion Remastered, and of course, so did I. We've been talking about it.

683
00:56:01,795 --> 00:56:05,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have to sit here and tell you that, surprise, it came out this week.

684
00:56:06,016 --> 00:56:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's talk a little bit about the release.

685
00:56:08,758 --> 00:56:11,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion was remastered.

686
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:16,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Bethesda brought in an external developer, Virtuos, that worked on this.

687
00:56:17,061 --> 00:56:22,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, obviously there were the leaks and the website stuff and all that stuff, but you know, whatever, it happened.

688
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:28,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the game did release on PC via Steam, uh, but also the Xbox app, if you want to get it that way.

689
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It released on Xbox Series S and X, and it is on the PlayStation 5.

690
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:42,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, Sony, uh, or excuse me, Microsoft putting this out on Sony platforms, even though, uh, Elder Scrolls is a Microsoft product now because of, uh, Microsoft's ownership of Bethesda.

691
00:56:43,578 --> 00:56:58,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Oblivion Remastered is also on Game Pass and that was admittedly why I jumped right into it the game will include the Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles expansion there are extras that are available if you do want to pick that up and yes

692
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:12,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Horse Armor DLC is one of those things that you can buy, which is sort of a parody of itself, because if you think about it, Horse Armor is a big part of the reason why gaming is the way it is now.

693
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say that because Elder Scrolls Oblivion 4 was a early, early game.

694
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:19,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a release game, actually, on the Xbox 360.

695
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,984
[SPEAKER_07]: It was close to release.

696
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out within a month, a few months later.

697
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:26,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like April of 2006, I think.

698
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:28,867
[SPEAKER_07]: The Horse Armor did exist.

699
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:50,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was, but this was special horse armor.

700
00:57:50,177 --> 00:57:51,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It was horse armor like no other.

701
00:57:52,918 --> 00:57:57,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And now this is almost standard for almost any AAA game that comes out.

702
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:06,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Has some type of horse armor, whether that's transmog for your main character or something special in the game that's cosmetic.

703
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:11,003
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very standard sort of thing now that you see in every game.

704
00:58:11,463 --> 00:58:11,763
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

705
00:58:13,004 --> 00:58:23,912
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really a huge surprise to see that Horse Armor has also made its way to the Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered.

706
00:58:24,012 --> 00:58:26,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not see, however, how much the Horse Armor cost.

707
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know that yet?

708
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:32,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was included with the DLC, because it came with all the DLC.

709
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:39,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was, if you got a deluxe edition of the game, you could get that.

710
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:53,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that the extra... So I think it still does come with all of the DLC, but there's additional skins or additional horse armor skins and player skins for...

711
00:58:55,788 --> 00:58:58,150
[SPEAKER_01]: are also available, I think, if I remember correctly.

712
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

713
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:05,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking at the Steam page and there is a digital deluxe edition or the regular Raymaster.

714
00:59:05,099 --> 00:59:07,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't see any other DLC.

715
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I just see a $10 deluxe upgrade.

716
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:11,947
[SPEAKER_07]: The deluxe upgrade includes...

717
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:22,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Armor of Order and Armor of Cataclysm, Weapons of Order and Weapons of Cataclysm, and Horse Armor in the Order and Cataclysm variations.

718
00:59:22,316 --> 00:59:26,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Order one looks very similar to the classic Horse Armor from the original.

719
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,161
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new, though.

720
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:29,362
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same.

721
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:30,322
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is not the same.

722
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:30,683
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

723
00:59:30,723 --> 00:59:31,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not the same.

724
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:33,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new Horse Armor.

725
00:59:33,405 --> 00:59:33,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

726
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:36,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing it again.

727
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:37,388
[SPEAKER_01]: They're selling you Horse Armor again.

728
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it, Todd Howard!

729
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:39,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it!

730
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, y'all could always just not buy it.

731
00:59:46,224 --> 01:00:10,781
[SPEAKER_01]: or or here's something you know like even though they don't support modding supports mods you don't need to buy horse armor it does literally get horse armor for free it does and i think uh i know alan will be jumping on that as soon as they release mods for the good stuff you know like nude mods and uh i mean he likes ui mods he likes ui mods that's what i'm saying like even though like they'll offer you free horse armor and they'll make your horse's ass fatter so like it's it is

732
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:15,789
[SPEAKER_01]: The modding community will give you a lot more than Bethesda will.

733
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:29,358
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not already out, can we get a fat fucking ass mod for the game, which makes everybody's ass fatter, but also the horses, the rats, everybody's ass just gets fatter.

734
01:00:29,478 --> 01:00:30,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Every ass is bigger.

735
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:32,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Juicy ass mod.

736
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:34,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thick.

737
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:38,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, T-H-I-C-C.

738
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:40,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Thick mode.

739
01:00:40,265 --> 01:00:41,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Thickum's mode.

740
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.

741
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:46,832
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

742
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:51,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about another game that maybe we want thick asses in?

743
01:00:52,981 --> 01:00:53,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure?

744
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:54,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

745
01:00:54,602 --> 01:00:56,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Sonic.

746
01:00:57,185 --> 01:01:02,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sonic and Shadow Generations is coming to Switch 2.

747
01:01:05,632 --> 01:01:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: They have just announced this.

748
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:08,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually they announced it

749
01:01:09,335 --> 01:01:11,476
[SPEAKER_04]: much earlier in the month.

750
01:01:12,337 --> 01:01:19,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's already on the Switch right now, but they really want to have this one to come forward on the new system.

751
01:01:20,482 --> 01:01:31,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also Yakuza 0, Director's Cut, Raido Remastered, POPO Tetris 2S, and Two Point Museum as well.

752
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:32,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are also included on the list.

753
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:37,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But the big one is Shadow and Sonic.

754
01:01:38,254 --> 01:01:38,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

755
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:42,219
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

756
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,305
[SPEAKER_07]: are on those digital unlock cards where the game isn't even on the card, it's just the digital unlock.

757
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:14,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently first party is pretty much all on cartridges, but third parties, like almost all of them are digital unlock cards, which I'm sure you're thrilled to hear.

758
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:23,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, because when the servers go down, that's going to be so wonderful that they're going to have that available.

759
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:26,467
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

760
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:58,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all, anytime a console is unhackable, that just raises the bar.

761
01:02:58,718 --> 01:03:11,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to take them time, but there will come a time, there will come a day where people hack that thing open so that you can sideload content in there and people will figure out how to rip that download stuff in the store and be able to sideload it on the Switch 2.

762
01:03:11,926 --> 01:03:22,453
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't figure it out in the first day, and certainly if you don't want Nintendo to sue your ass, your fat ass, then you don't want to do that within the first, you know, pretty much during the life of the Switch 2, essentially.

763
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:23,274
[SPEAKER_07]: But,

764
01:03:23,954 --> 01:03:24,835
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen.

765
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:27,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's how these games will ultimately get preserved.

766
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:34,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is really fucking weird that I'm saying we're relying on the modding and the piracy community to help us preserve games.

767
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:39,207
[SPEAKER_07]: But that is exactly what I'm saying in a weird sort of way.

768
01:03:39,928 --> 01:03:41,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it will get there.

769
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:41,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to take a little time.

770
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:48,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So because again, you shouldn't you shouldn't be sideloading games the first day.

771
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:49,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just straight up piracy.

772
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:53,507
[SPEAKER_07]: And that doesn't support, you know, the people that make the games and all that.

773
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:58,269
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also not that many Switch 2 games that you could be sideloading or pirating anyways day one.

774
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So like.

775
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,730
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to wait for a few years.

776
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,131
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to download yet.

777
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:07,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranmar A68K in chat says, I mean, let's be real.

778
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:10,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Corporations don't care about game preservation.

779
01:04:10,448 --> 01:04:11,509
[SPEAKER_07]: That's up to the community.

780
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:12,789
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part, yes.

781
01:04:12,869 --> 01:04:18,330
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some companies I feel like have gone a little ways to try to make this better.

782
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:28,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Microsoft's actually one of the better ones, which is weird because that wasn't always their MO, you know, when they got rid of the backwards compatibility for Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

783
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:31,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they really made an effort to go back and do a lot of that.

784
01:04:32,053 --> 01:04:53,769
[SPEAKER_07]: and I feel like also ironically they own Blizzard now and Blizzard's been very good at preserving their catalog like they remaster it but they also have it in a way that you can preserve it they let good old games have Diablo you know which is also a big preservation thing so I do feel like there are some companies that recognize I think it also helps that Phil Spencer's gone on record saying he recognizes the importance of it

785
01:04:54,269 --> 01:05:21,688
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do agree for the most part most corporations don't give a shit or they want to be able to continue to sell it to you for some time which in a way I mean again looking at Microsoft Bethesda that's kind of what Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered is it's a way to sell you a 20 year old game all over again but of course I say sell because Game Pass is a big draw for that I feel like this game is getting a lot of traction off Game Pass but there's a lot of people playing it on PlayStation 5 as well so

786
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:47,424
[SPEAKER_07]: but the good news is I will say this the good news is if you want to get the original Oblivion you still can it is being sold in tandem with the remaster you can still get the OG 2006 Oblivion which is cool but at this point honestly unless you really are looking for the Mr. Potato Head faces like the remastered is all the same bugs you remember but

787
01:05:49,517 --> 01:05:50,738
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't fix that.

788
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:52,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I do kind of like that.

789
01:05:52,459 --> 01:05:54,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get it.

790
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:57,443
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all gaslit ourselves into accepting bugs now.

791
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,864
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so wild.

792
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:03,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I like buggy games in the sense that it makes it so I can exploit them.

793
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes it fun for me.

794
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:05,949
[SPEAKER_01]: You always have.

795
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:09,271
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I used to like.

796
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:13,014
[SPEAKER_07]: You were the one person that was like, Driver 3 is awesome, but not for the races you think.

797
01:06:13,394 --> 01:06:28,507
[SPEAKER_01]: it was so like here's how I play my only memories of Oblivion I didn't play much of Oblivion when it came out on console even though it was yeah like on Xbox 360 and stuff like that and I remember playing it day one and all that but

798
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:53,209
[SPEAKER_01]: like here's how I play because I didn't understand what I was supposed to do in the game so I ended up joining like the thieves guild and then once you're in there like all the items that are on the shelves aren't you know stolen anymore so you could just take it all and so that's what I do I'd go into someone's house and I just take all the stuff and I take it to the store and go sell it and then there was like I think a dupe glitch at the time to like duplicate armor and everything and

799
01:06:53,749 --> 01:06:54,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember any of that, so...

800
01:07:06,525 --> 01:07:31,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll get to play this game legit the first time you know that I think for some people is the entire charm of Elder Scrolls it's also for other people the biggest turnoff of Elder Scrolls is that you do have that ability to literally do anything in the open world and you can just fuck off the main game you can just say I don't want to play the main game I just want to I just want to murder people and try to get away with it and that's what that was a

801
01:07:31,169 --> 01:07:31,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

802
01:07:51,096 --> 01:07:58,486
[SPEAKER_07]: and why The Elder Scrolls 6 is taking fucking forever because they've set such a bar for themselves when it comes to this wide open world.

803
01:07:58,827 --> 01:08:05,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really hope to hell, I really hope to hell they don't use generative AI to try to fill in the gaps, especially with Quest.

804
01:08:05,997 --> 01:08:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I...

805
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:14,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I sort of trust the Elder Scrolls to know that people are going to see right through that and are going to, you know, and it's been taking them this long.

806
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:21,722
[SPEAKER_07]: So you hope a lot of it has been cooked up and they're not going to rely on AI, generative AI anyway, to come up with quests and books and things like that.

807
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:25,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, they have radiant quests, which were lame.

808
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:28,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember that where it's like, go to this place and get this thing.

809
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:30,844
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just that over and over.

810
01:08:31,965 --> 01:08:35,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see, but it's interesting to see how this is all new again.

811
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:35,830
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

812
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, where were we?

813
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:39,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let's go back to your next story.

814
01:08:40,455 --> 01:08:40,916
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

815
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:42,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm being distracted.

816
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:43,919
[SPEAKER_01]: The cat's over here.

817
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Great reason to be distracted.

818
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:46,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Skate 4.

819
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:53,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why this is a shock, or the Skate reboot, whatever we're going to call it.

820
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:54,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Skate, I guess.

821
01:08:55,308 --> 01:08:58,072
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out, I think, later this year, actually.

822
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be online only.

823
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:01,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?

824
01:09:01,516 --> 01:09:03,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a live service game, so duh.

825
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:04,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It is...

826
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:09,304
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not going to be an offline version of the game, EA said.

827
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:19,733
[SPEAKER_01]: The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing, massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving and always full of microtransactions.

828
01:09:19,773 --> 01:09:22,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, that was my bit added there.

829
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not surprised.

830
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:27,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once I heard it was a live service game, I was like, yeah, of course.

831
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it is.

832
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:28,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

833
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:34,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is somewhat a dangerous stance for companies to take now with what's going on with Ubisoft and the crew.

834
01:09:34,058 --> 01:09:36,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't function offline.

835
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:37,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's SimCity.

836
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:40,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The odd line is integral to its functionality.

837
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot work offline.

838
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:50,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I wish we would get a new SimCity game to just erase the taste from our mouths of what happened with the last one.

839
01:09:50,642 --> 01:09:52,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to attempt to list this kitty up here.

840
01:09:52,723 --> 01:09:54,483
[SPEAKER_07]: She does not like being held.

841
01:09:54,763 --> 01:09:56,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the kitty that roams from house to house?

842
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,541
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our kitty, basically, now.

843
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:00,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

844
01:10:01,102 --> 01:10:01,843
[SPEAKER_07]: There she is.

845
01:10:01,883 --> 01:10:02,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, kitty.

846
01:10:03,124 --> 01:10:03,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

847
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: The camera's kind of glitching a little bit, but we can get a sense.

848
01:10:05,486 --> 01:10:06,527
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get a sense.

849
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:10,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Your green screen is just thinking that parts of the cat are green, but that's all right.

850
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:11,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

851
01:10:12,011 --> 01:10:12,651
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a pretty kitty.

852
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

853
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:13,612
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

854
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, kitty.

855
01:10:15,814 --> 01:10:15,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw.

856
01:10:16,154 --> 01:10:16,875
[SPEAKER_05]: The baby!

857
01:10:17,355 --> 01:10:18,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Please clip the cat sighting.

858
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:18,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

859
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,017
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

860
01:10:21,324 --> 01:10:22,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's move on.

861
01:10:22,945 --> 01:10:24,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I find this very interesting.

862
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:26,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also not surprising whatsoever.

863
01:10:26,646 --> 01:10:32,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it has to do with, um, video game journalism online, people's favorite topics, right?

864
01:10:32,789 --> 01:10:40,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, uh, this, and this is a story to be fair that I got off Reddit on a website called thegamebusiness.com that's running this report.

865
01:10:40,512 --> 01:10:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a website I'm super familiar with.

866
01:10:42,153 --> 01:10:45,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, uh, it was a gameindustry.biz or, you know, one of those big sites.

867
01:10:46,395 --> 01:10:46,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But I...

868
01:10:47,555 --> 01:10:58,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in my own consumption of journalism online, and I think a lot of your own ways you consume gaming media, I think you can see how a story like this makes a lot of sense.

869
01:10:59,883 --> 01:11:06,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently, based on data from the press engine, the top 135 video game websites published over 635,000 articles.

870
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:17,157
[SPEAKER_07]: so when we're talking about major outlets we mean IGN, GameSpot, Famitsu, Eurogamer 635,000 articles that's actually a drop

871
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:27,241
[SPEAKER_07]: of 13%, 100,000 articles less than the same period, quarter one in 2024.

872
01:11:28,401 --> 01:11:31,163
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's even with the Switch 2 announcement.

873
01:11:31,183 --> 01:11:33,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I guess, no, that wasn't until quarter two, so maybe we can't count that.

874
01:11:34,004 --> 01:11:36,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you would still expect there'd be a lot.

875
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: This means reviews, news, guides, features, codes, and all of that different stuff.

876
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:47,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Press Engine, what this is, this is a PR tool.

877
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:56,674
[SPEAKER_07]: That if you're a developer, if you're a publisher, you use this to send out game codes and press releases to journalists and content creators through this press engine.

878
01:11:58,274 --> 01:12:07,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently in the press engine, they've actually seen the number of press contacts, nearly 3000 of them, about 2900, disappear from the database over two years.

879
01:12:08,098 --> 01:12:09,098
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

880
01:12:35,447 --> 01:12:43,231
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the industry's perspective on this is that the games media is apparently scaling back coverage of games outside the big AAA games.

881
01:12:43,932 --> 01:12:50,796
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is very harmful to indie games, smaller games, other games, trying to make a name for themselves.

882
01:12:51,796 --> 01:12:56,379
[SPEAKER_07]: In a quote from Gareth Williams, the founder of the Press Engine...

883
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching.

884
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you next time.

885
01:13:18,277 --> 01:13:26,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's interesting, I think, because we live in this era of a lot of Twitch influence, YouTube influence, TikTok influence.

886
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:30,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's one thing I'm realizing with this Oblivion remaster.

887
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:33,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing a lot of content for Oblivion remaster on TikTok.

888
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:38,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, granted, I've probably fallen into that algorithm now because I've watched enough of it.

889
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:39,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm seeing these things.

890
01:13:39,519 --> 01:13:43,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, fine, the strongest helmet in the game as soon as you come out of the dungeon.

891
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And so he's going, you just go to this point on your map.

892
01:13:46,641 --> 01:13:48,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it'll be people showing bugs.

893
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:49,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you.

894
01:13:49,761 --> 01:13:54,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen at least five videos where people are like, here's the bug in 2006.

895
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:56,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the bug in 2025.

896
01:13:57,283 --> 01:13:58,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like the same thing.

897
01:13:58,323 --> 01:13:59,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a lot of that on TikTok.

898
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:01,884
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also feel like short form bugs.

899
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:14,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Social media, meaning things like X for people for whatever reason that still choose to use that, and Blue Sky and Mastodon, that short form social media has really stepped in for a lot of this.

900
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:19,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Just curious out there, a little informal poll in chat.

901
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:30,928
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you were getting your Switch 2 pre-order information from a Wario64, from a cheap-ass gamer, from a social media person?

902
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:34,269
[SPEAKER_07]: How many of you were getting your stuff from that?

903
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:38,191
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet an awful lot of you were getting that stuff from social media.

904
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:53,606
[SPEAKER_07]: because that is now and it's interesting because the thing with social media is because you're limited to only what 300 characters on Blue Sky and it's similar on Mastodon and the others because it's similar these social media posts have to get to the fucking point

905
01:14:54,608 --> 01:14:58,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's been a big frustration with a lot of other types of gaming journalism.

906
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: We all know on YouTube, they never get to the fucking point, right?

907
01:15:02,232 --> 01:15:04,493
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta watch five minutes of bullshit to get this.

908
01:15:04,853 --> 01:15:06,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, the... The...

909
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:28,911
[SPEAKER_07]: words escape me at this moment sometimes even like articles and stuff you know the clickbait headline you'll never believe what game just fucking got delisted and it talks here's how the Xbox store works here's that and then finally there'll be like a throwaway and it's like this game that none of you have ever heard of

910
01:15:29,572 --> 01:15:29,772
[SPEAKER_07]: E3VL E3VL

911
01:15:50,101 --> 01:15:54,446
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya said, both them and the Switch-centric blogs I follow on BlueSky.

912
01:15:55,387 --> 01:15:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture says, I got my info from y'all.

913
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's sweet.

914
01:15:58,551 --> 01:15:58,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

915
01:15:59,452 --> 01:16:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I have to remember, there are a few of you out there who really do get your little gaming dose here on this show, and we appreciate that and hope you were able to get a Switch if you wanted one.

916
01:16:08,882 --> 01:16:09,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

917
01:16:11,215 --> 01:16:16,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Renmari says, I just follow one particular person who covers a ton of Japanese games.

918
01:16:16,419 --> 01:16:17,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that also makes sense.

919
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:23,323
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's somebody that's really into a genre or a type, like, especially I would imagine like fighting games.

920
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:37,593
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to see every like fighting game character that's going to be released or every, you know, that really like hyper focuses on that genre, every costume, there's probably some social media accounts that really do that a lot better than maybe the more general ones or a

921
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another kind of perk about short form social media, wherever you're consuming it, is that you get a lot of people that are very tailored to your interests.

922
01:16:48,543 --> 01:16:53,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm giggling because live here on Twitch, Loki is out feeding the cats or something.

923
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:58,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way the green screen works, once in a while, he just fuses into the oblivion scene.

924
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:01,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm getting Nick Arcade flashbacks.

925
01:17:04,804 --> 01:17:06,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it's just kind of funny.

926
01:17:07,486 --> 01:17:07,746
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

927
01:17:08,366 --> 01:17:16,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranmari says, because even when sites like IGN do cover my usual niches, it's obviously often with a ton of ignorance.

928
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:23,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't necessarily disagree, but I do feel like a lot of sites are getting better.

929
01:17:23,975 --> 01:17:28,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of sites realize they've been called out on this over the years.

930
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:43,548
[SPEAKER_07]: and I've tried to get more in tune with people and this is why hiring diverse journalists is very helpful because you get a lot of diverse tastes, diverse perspectives and why I think more websites out there are succeeding in this department.

931
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Not always and I'm sure you can cite some examples where they are not getting it right but I do feel like overall I see a lot of gaming blogs and places are being a little more accurate and

932
01:17:57,311 --> 01:18:03,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Faithful in tune with what the fans want in certain genres, at least again compared to, say, 2006 or whatever.

933
01:18:06,344 --> 01:18:11,371
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I found that story very interesting, and it's definitely showing a way that things are changing online.

934
01:18:11,671 --> 01:18:12,112
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just...

935
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:21,516
[SPEAKER_07]: On a quick tangent relating things to the real world, again on TikTok, you know that guy, I'm sure you've all seen him on your TikTok feed at some point if you use TikTok.

936
01:18:21,536 --> 01:18:25,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you've seen him on your feed at some point, that Aaron Parnas who comes through.

937
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We have breaking news.

938
01:18:26,878 --> 01:18:28,058
[SPEAKER_07]: We have news on the Trump terrorist.

939
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:29,839
[SPEAKER_07]: He's this young guy.

940
01:18:29,879 --> 01:18:37,921
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like 25 years old and he's really mastered working that TikTok algorithm where there are legitimately a ton of people that are getting news from him.

941
01:18:38,741 --> 01:18:41,844
[SPEAKER_07]: and people like him because there's, you know, now a lot of people are knocking that off.

942
01:18:42,224 --> 01:18:48,589
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people getting their news or and he's probably not the first to do it, to be fair, but he is the one that has been the most prolific out there on TikTok.

943
01:18:50,310 --> 01:19:01,279
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people that get their news from him versus traditional media versus USA Today or the New York Times versus even CNN or Fox News or MSNBC.

944
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:08,125
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of unlocking this whole other way that people consume news, which I just I just think that stuff is very fascinating.

945
01:19:09,557 --> 01:19:38,151
[SPEAKER_04]: so anyway but there's always time for a movie so we'll go to our next story, DarkSakura so yeah we are looking at a Michael Bay movie I don't know how I feel about that another one Sidney Sweeney and Michael Bay are going to be doing an Outrun video game it is a video game, Outrun movie

946
01:19:41,482 --> 01:20:07,912
[SPEAKER_04]: they are producing it basically going through just a driving fun time and outrun they're saying it's going to be going through Universal the screenplay is being written by Jason Rothwell who did Polar and Arachnid I don't know how I feel about that either but yeah

947
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:11,953
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if it actually happens or if it'll be any good.

948
01:20:15,075 --> 01:20:20,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have my hopes up very high, but then again, video game media in general has been surprisingly good the last few years.

949
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you say Michael Bay and I go, but maybe it'll have some really good special effects.

950
01:20:25,704 --> 01:20:29,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they want to get that fast in the furious audience, although that's also a universal product.

951
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:30,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.

952
01:20:30,467 --> 01:20:33,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is something they want to put out in the off years.

953
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:33,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

954
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

955
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:40,359
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just such a weird property to come back, but at the same time, it can be fun.

956
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:41,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

957
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I think an OutRun movie can be fun.

958
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:47,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think... I mean, it's universal.

959
01:20:47,786 --> 01:20:48,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Michael Bay.

960
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:54,433
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's essentially they're making Fast and the Furious again, but just different.

961
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:56,735
[SPEAKER_04]: But with a Ferrari.

962
01:20:57,356 --> 01:20:58,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree that it's a...

963
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:01,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It better be a four.

964
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:03,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Off year for Fast and the Furious.

965
01:21:03,492 --> 01:21:05,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've made so many of those movies.

966
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:06,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So many.

967
01:21:07,775 --> 01:21:09,136
[SPEAKER_07]: How many Fast and Furious movies are there?

968
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Aren't there like 12 at least?

969
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:10,997
50,000.

970
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:14,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over 10.

971
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:15,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that.

972
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:15,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.

973
01:21:16,401 --> 01:21:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Wild, wild, wild.

974
01:21:17,242 --> 01:21:18,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

975
01:21:18,803 --> 01:21:22,045
[SPEAKER_04]: If they get any more Fast or Furious, they'll be in another dimension.

976
01:21:23,866 --> 01:21:24,187
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

977
01:21:25,327 --> 01:21:28,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on and talk about this story.

978
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

979
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:31,092
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

980
01:21:32,172 --> 01:21:35,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, we've got... Why is my screen not coming up?

981
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:38,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Ubisoft.

982
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:41,857
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they are data harvesting now.

983
01:21:41,877 --> 01:21:43,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, why not?

984
01:21:43,137 --> 01:21:45,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Just throw it on top of the pile of all the bad things that they do.

985
01:21:46,119 --> 01:21:49,160
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been fined 79 million euro.

986
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:57,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially that they found that they are doing some hidden data harvesting stuff.

987
01:21:58,103 --> 01:22:19,638
[SPEAKER_01]: there is basically the complaint centers on Far Cry Primal and Assassin's Creed Shadows which required an internet connection despite being offline experiences and the lawsuit is alleging that Ubisoft is using this to siphon off players gaming habits um

988
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:32,375
[SPEAKER_01]: basically say that one user noted that Far Cry Primal noticed the game pinged external servers including those of Amazon and Google 150 times in 10 minutes.

989
01:22:34,257 --> 01:22:41,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure what their their I thought it was for authentication but who knows.

990
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:53,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, interesting to see what comes out of this, if that's the case, if they actually find... I mean, obviously, they're facing a fine of $79 million.

991
01:22:53,603 --> 01:22:59,409
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's been actually determined whether or not they're at fault yet, but... Right.

992
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:01,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

993
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:05,155
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird that they would...

994
01:23:06,018 --> 01:23:12,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Be stealing data or something like... I mean, it's not weird that they'd be doing that, but I thought that these servers were mainly for authentication, which is ridiculous.

995
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,901
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an anti-piracy thing, essentially.

996
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to incorporate Ubisoft Plus or whatever the hell that they had in their Ubisoft Club or something.

997
01:23:22,264 --> 01:23:25,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

998
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:26,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

999
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:30,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be surprised if it comes out that they're stealing people's data, too.

1000
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:30,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

1001
01:23:30,968 --> 01:23:31,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because...

1002
01:23:32,469 --> 01:23:33,730
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a terrible company.

1003
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:34,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1004
01:23:34,530 --> 01:23:44,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, or, you know, that I think sometimes maybe the intentions weren't necessarily dubious, but there's a lot of ignorance that comes to it.

1005
01:23:44,177 --> 01:23:47,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's just, you know, run this thing and maybe this will be useful at some point.

1006
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:51,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't really think about like what, how that can be perceived by the people playing the games.

1007
01:23:51,842 --> 01:23:53,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think maybe that'll...

1008
01:23:55,891 --> 01:23:56,151
[SPEAKER_07]: FOMO's Mofo

1009
01:24:19,676 --> 01:24:20,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast

1010
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,450
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1011
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:08,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Last Christmas I got an Evercade.

1012
01:25:09,841 --> 01:25:18,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried to play those cartridges and it said, womp womp, these cartridges are licensed for handheld use only.

1013
01:25:18,433 --> 01:25:21,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I couldn't play them on my Versys and I was like, that's a bunch of bullshit.

1014
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:21,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1015
01:25:22,518 --> 01:25:24,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently that situation has been rectified.

1016
01:25:24,638 --> 01:25:34,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought something was weird because as you may or may not know, I picked up this Evercade versus, I'm sorry, this Evercade arcade machine that sits behind me.

1017
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,901
[SPEAKER_07]: My big head covers it when we tape.

1018
01:25:36,241 --> 01:25:47,303
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have a Mega Man branded machine because it has some Capcom titles, including Strider, Final Fight, and the two Mega Man fighting games are built into that Evercade machine.

1019
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:51,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see there are two cartridges, those little white lines behind me on Twitch.

1020
01:25:53,049 --> 01:25:54,149
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1021
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:38,089
[SPEAKER_07]: or they have worked out these rights issues so yeah a post in the official Evercade group on Facebook said obviously the Namco carts worked on the Evercade versus but apparently on April 16th there was a some update that happened and now Evercade replied and said all cartridges are now compatible please check our website for any frequently asked questions so that's great

1022
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:42,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised they're not making a bigger deal out of that, but I don't know if those cartridges are easy to find.

1023
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like those cartridges might be out of print.

1024
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:49,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was part of the reason I was jumping on getting them was that they were going to stop printing those cartridges.

1025
01:26:49,933 --> 01:26:51,893
[SPEAKER_07]: But yay, I'm glad they work now.

1026
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:57,035
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I have other news on the Evercade front, though, if you don't have one yet.

1027
01:26:58,476 --> 01:26:58,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

1028
01:26:59,876 --> 01:27:02,017
[SPEAKER_07]: US orders are being paused.

1029
01:27:17,022 --> 01:27:29,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, Evercade has said, because Evercade is a UK company, they are, quote, taking a cautious approach to the situation by, quote, temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers.

1030
01:27:29,607 --> 01:27:33,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Until we know more, we do not want to put customers at risk of unexpected charges.

1031
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:35,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's in a statement from Funstock.

1032
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:40,593
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward.

1033
01:27:40,893 --> 01:27:45,637
[SPEAKER_07]: This pause in service will be effective from Monday, the 28th of April and means that customers in the U.S.

1034
01:27:45,997 --> 01:27:48,699
[SPEAKER_07]: will not be able to make new orders on our website.

1035
01:27:49,259 --> 01:27:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to guess that they're going to pass off any tariff costs directly to the consumer as an additional tax, which you think that would piss me off, but it's not Evercade's fault.

1036
01:27:59,606 --> 01:28:00,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all know whose fault it is.

1037
01:28:01,467 --> 01:28:03,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress could end this tomorrow.

1038
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:05,850
[SPEAKER_07]: But they won't.

1039
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like the way Rin Mari in chat puts this.

1040
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:12,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Doofus J. Tariffs.

1041
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:14,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1042
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Doofus J. Tariffs.

1043
01:28:22,824 --> 01:28:23,164
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1044
01:28:24,245 --> 01:28:26,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a non-doofy part of the show.

1045
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:29,169
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a chance for DarkSakura to take a trip down memory lane.

1046
01:28:29,549 --> 01:28:30,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's roll the bump.

1047
01:28:40,714 --> 01:28:41,054
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1048
01:29:03,345 --> 01:29:23,601
[SPEAKER_04]: but it works it's for Nintendo DS it's the Korg DS10 synthesizer and I kind of got a little inspired watching it because I was watching this guy I always mix his name David Horowitz who puts out interesting videos

1049
01:29:24,221 --> 01:29:33,538
[SPEAKER_04]: instrument samplers, VST units for typical DAWs, like Logic Pro.

1050
01:29:33,838 --> 01:29:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the other ones?

1051
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:53,593
[SPEAKER_04]: not Serato DJ there's the other one Pro Tools I think is the other one but anyway this is a music creation program and it emulates the core MS synthesizers

1052
01:29:56,796 --> 01:30:03,181
[SPEAKER_04]: When people usually talk about the Korg MS-10, it's a single oscillator monosynth.

1053
01:30:04,022 --> 01:30:09,266
[SPEAKER_04]: This adds the sync that the Korg MS-20 doesn't have.

1054
01:30:09,306 --> 01:30:14,610
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was released originally in Japan on July 27, 2008, October 10, 2008 in Europe, and November 4, the same year in the United States.

1055
01:30:20,234 --> 01:30:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a newer DSi compatible version called the Korg DS10 Plus that was released in 2009 but we're talking about this one so basically it creates sound with two analog synthesizer emulators each with two voltage controlled oscillators where the Korg MS-10 had only one VCO

1056
01:30:49,442 --> 01:31:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: um it has a sawtooth a pulse a triangle and noise waveform there's a four-part drum machine um that uh uses the same techniques as the synthesizers the um you can of course tweak them with virtual knobs change the value of the synthesizer parameters like cut off waveform shape you know just the typical stuff that you would have on like a you know any DAW um

1057
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:31,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the interface, since you're using the touchscreen, you can use your finger to move things around, to change your position.

1058
01:31:32,171 --> 01:31:43,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And it simulates, using a stylus, it simulates the Korg Chaos Pad, which is another touchscreen Korg sampler and audio processor.

1059
01:31:43,153 --> 01:31:43,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in 1999.

1060
01:31:43,554 --> 01:31:43,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.

1061
01:31:46,074 --> 01:32:10,666
[SPEAKER_04]: um you can record 21 sessions with 16 different step patterns um with either live input or through a sequencer i mean this is fairly fairly you know for for something that is coming up on almost 20 years old we're still using these same things today when i make music and i'm playing with an eq

1062
01:32:11,966 --> 01:32:16,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, or with any sort of software instrument.

1063
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually tweaking the same type of stuff this is talking about.

1064
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:34,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But the effects it has available is a chorus, a flanger, a flanger, sorry, I always get the word bad, a delay parameter, which, I mean, again, that's standard fare.

1065
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:40,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can edit the drum sounds, so they'll have different effects globally.

1066
01:32:40,868 --> 01:32:42,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So it did get a great review.

1067
01:32:43,489 --> 01:32:47,451
[SPEAKER_04]: 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, 85% on GameRankings.

1068
01:32:48,231 --> 01:33:04,357
[SPEAKER_04]: IGN gave it a low score, the lowest score, even though it wasn't very low, 7.1 out of 10 and said, quote, it isn't standalone full-featured music software, however, sorry, but other reviewers get very positive scores.

1069
01:33:04,397 --> 01:33:08,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, basically, this is a great little synthesizer to have on the go.

1070
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:09,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

1071
01:33:11,778 --> 01:33:13,799
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make tons of music with it.

1072
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:30,490
[SPEAKER_04]: The example I saw today was actually using this and then some software that was made specifically for the Game Boy to use its in-system instruments and did a nice little ditty out of the two.

1073
01:33:31,051 --> 01:33:33,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were follow-ups.

1074
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:38,255
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the Korg M-O-N-D that came out for the 3DS and the eShop.

1075
01:33:39,852 --> 01:33:41,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in 2013.

1076
01:33:42,154 --> 01:33:47,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had sounds from the Korg M1 and sounds from the Korg O1W.

1077
01:33:48,418 --> 01:34:01,127
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2014, Korg DSN12 came out on 3DS that focused, and I quote, the user creating their own unique synth sounds from scratch and had a 3D oscilloscope screen that let you visualize your sounds.

1078
01:34:01,947 --> 01:34:02,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah.

1079
01:34:04,349 --> 01:34:08,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I probably want to

1080
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:36,726
[SPEAKER_04]: go pick this up and I'm sure I can find it pretty easily but especially with the fact I've been making my own stuff a lot lately I think this is a fun tool and it does it really is a full functioning system you are going to need a few other bells and whistles a few other accessories to get the most out of it but there you go

1081
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:44,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think that's pretty rad that like all these years later, this is still a very functional sort of music making system to be using.

1082
01:34:45,478 --> 01:34:51,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of ironic because, you know, we had the Commodore 64 cameo earlier in the show, thanks to DJ Ranma S.

1083
01:34:52,644 --> 01:35:16,310
[SPEAKER_07]: and I sort of see that in a similar thing too is that one of the best things that Commodore 64 still has going for all of these years later fucking 40 years later after it was released is that it makes some fucking incredible chiptune music that musicians today still use and I think the same could be said of a platform like this so you know I was that name I was referring to was David Hillowitz hmm

1084
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:25,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, you know, I actually, I'm just gonna, for those of us who are here, um, in chat, I'm gonna link his YouTube.

1085
01:35:26,252 --> 01:35:29,495
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, it's David Hillowitz Music.

1086
01:35:29,795 --> 01:35:32,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's H-I-L-O-W-I-T-Z.

1087
01:35:32,797 --> 01:35:41,163
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically, he did that whole series using, um, the Game Boy and the DS.

1088
01:35:41,203 --> 01:35:41,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1089
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:50,981
[SPEAKER_04]: to make music and put that, you know, live up on how he does it and so that other people can do it.

1090
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But one thing I like is that he goes in and finds like interesting instruments out there and samples them.

1091
01:35:57,384 --> 01:36:08,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one of them was Casio's vaporwave guitar or an Omnicord, Casio keyboards, old mandolins, just kind of a toothbrush.

1092
01:36:09,448 --> 01:36:10,589
[SPEAKER_04]: He made samples from a toothbrush.

1093
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: but this one when I saw that was there I was like oh this is so cool so I absolutely suggest finding that video on his channel and giving it a watch but he goes a lot into this particular game as well

1094
01:36:27,895 --> 01:36:28,155
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1095
01:36:28,695 --> 01:36:29,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool pick.

1096
01:36:29,295 --> 01:36:34,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, maybe it's more of an application for the system, but they put it on a game cart.

1097
01:36:35,637 --> 01:36:36,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I still say it fits.

1098
01:36:36,977 --> 01:36:37,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good choice.

1099
01:36:37,817 --> 01:36:39,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I reckon you could play with it.

1100
01:36:39,338 --> 01:36:41,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1101
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:45,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to say playing with the piano when I'm just sitting there diddling out a song, so why not?

1102
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:45,939
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1103
01:36:46,579 --> 01:36:48,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1104
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a little bit more for you.

1105
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:56,822
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have a ton of news this week, surprisingly, but we do have some rapid fire hits to get to, so Loki.

1106
01:36:58,052 --> 01:37:23,558
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so this is kind of fun so you may remember back they i think it was for the playstation anniversary the 30th anniversary they had put up some limited time skins for your playstation 5 that kind of you know did like the playstation 1 buddha playstation 2 playstation 3 and stuff like that but it was only a limited time thing um but now they've uh with a new patch they brought them back

1107
01:37:24,218 --> 01:37:30,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually keep them on your console now and boot up with those classic themes.

1108
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.

1109
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:34,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1110
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:37,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1111
01:37:39,258 --> 01:37:40,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to Dark Sakura.

1112
01:37:43,985 --> 01:37:50,795
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Wheel of Time open world RPG adaptation.

1113
01:37:52,337 --> 01:37:55,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I know no one asked for this, but it looks like it's going to happen.

1114
01:37:55,882 --> 01:37:57,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1115
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:04,622
[SPEAKER_04]: People love Robert Jordan's books.

1116
01:38:05,643 --> 01:38:10,585
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a first-person shooter that was based off of it that's available on GOG.

1117
01:38:12,666 --> 01:38:19,489
[SPEAKER_04]: This has a three-year development cycle that they're anticipating.

1118
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:25,712
[SPEAKER_04]: The involvement is going to be Warner Bros.

1119
01:38:25,732 --> 01:38:28,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertainment, Activision, EA, and Sierra Online.

1120
01:38:32,469 --> 01:38:32,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1121
01:38:34,612 --> 01:38:38,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the books very well, but apparently the TV show is pretty good too.

1122
01:38:39,339 --> 01:38:40,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know people that are really into the books.

1123
01:38:41,061 --> 01:38:42,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not a game?

1124
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:42,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1125
01:38:44,272 --> 01:38:48,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about a recent release that is landing very well with folks out there.

1126
01:38:48,694 --> 01:38:50,495
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Claire Obscure, Expedition 33.

1127
01:38:50,595 --> 01:38:53,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise I will get around to this eventually because this really does sound like my jam.

1128
01:38:54,396 --> 01:38:56,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's only been out just a few days.

1129
01:38:56,777 --> 01:38:57,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

1130
01:38:57,457 --> 01:39:04,620
[SPEAKER_07]: After those first three days... Well, actually, I should say after the first day, it hit 500,000 in sales.

1131
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after three days, it hit 1 million.

1132
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:12,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is still considering it is available on Game Pass.

1133
01:39:12,023 --> 01:39:12,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1134
01:39:12,563 --> 01:39:16,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get the game on PC, Xbox Series X or S and PlayStation 5.

1135
01:39:17,649 --> 01:39:19,170
[SPEAKER_07]: But the game is selling very well.

1136
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:25,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently it has the, I think I was seeing the highest Metacritic user score ever.

1137
01:39:26,314 --> 01:39:28,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1138
01:39:47,142 --> 01:39:47,943
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1139
01:40:07,213 --> 01:40:08,154
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1140
01:40:27,048 --> 01:40:29,930
[SPEAKER_07]: be turn-based, which would be wild to see if that happens.

1141
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:41,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're probably far enough along in development if they did that, but they're probably far enough along in development they can't 180, but then again, you think about how long 15 was in development, anything's possible.

1142
01:40:42,498 --> 01:40:50,023
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 could also be another online game, which would fit the every three pattern, 11, 14, although I guess that's not much of a pattern, but it could.

1143
01:40:51,724 --> 01:40:52,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1144
01:40:53,743 --> 01:40:58,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, FifthDream in chat says 17 is an MMO.

1145
01:40:58,744 --> 01:41:01,785
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people seem to think that, but we'll see, we'll see.

1146
01:41:02,705 --> 01:41:10,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out in a store or digital storefront near you.

1147
01:41:10,548 --> 01:41:11,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, let's start with the U.S.

1151
01:42:13,613 --> 01:42:14,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that name.

1152
01:42:14,174 --> 01:42:15,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the Shotgun Cop Man.

1153
01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:21,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Shotgun Cop Man Alright, well heading over to Japan, guess what week it is?

1154
01:42:22,433 --> 01:42:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one week a year where I go to the games That's right, Golden Week is this week So running from the 29th to May 6th Showa Day, Constitution Memorial Day, Greenery Day, Children's Day It's a busy week and not a busy week for game releases as a result in Japan But actually surprising, I do have one

1155
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:46,746
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo Switch, Ogu and the Secret Forest is coming out on the 29th in Japan.

1156
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:51,151

1157
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:54,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know how some games snuck through there, but they did.

1158
01:42:54,894 --> 01:42:57,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Just checking the PlayStation 5, just out of curiosity.

1159
01:42:57,897 --> 01:43:00,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that MotoGP 25 is also released in Japan.

1160
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:05,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming the only reason that's coming out is because that's a worldwide release date.

1161
01:43:05,704 --> 01:43:06,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, they would probably...

1162
01:43:07,907 --> 01:43:08,727
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1163
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:20,426

01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:06,321

[SPEAKER_07]: Still a pretty busy week in the non-Japan regions.

1180
01:44:34,758 --> 01:44:34,998
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1181
01:44:35,659 --> 01:44:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that was it for news.

1182
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:42,842
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually somewhat of a slow news week outside of everything that was going on with the switch and the other things we've brought up earlier in the show.

1183
01:44:43,503 --> 01:44:47,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the part where we go to the listener roundtable where we ask for your feedback.

1184
01:44:47,705 --> 01:44:49,046
[SPEAKER_07]: We go to the mailbag every week.

1185
01:44:49,106 --> 01:44:51,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at OrangeZandrieta.com.

1186
01:44:51,307 --> 01:44:52,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we had anything in there.

1187
01:44:53,971 --> 01:44:57,453
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a bunch of shit You know what we do with shit?

1188

1189
01:45:22,153 --> 01:45:24,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the mailbox because I deleted everything.

1190
01:45:24,154 --> 01:45:25,275
[SPEAKER_07]: It just came in.

1191
01:45:25,335 --> 01:45:27,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll forward it for my personal email.

1192
01:45:27,356 --> 01:45:28,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It just came in at like 7.02.

1193
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:31,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So like within the last hour.

1194
01:45:31,638 --> 01:45:33,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see anything like that show up in our mailbox.

1195
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:35,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, maybe it got forwarded to my personal email.

1196
01:45:35,921 --> 01:45:36,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1197
01:45:36,661 --> 01:45:37,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1198
01:45:37,942 --> 01:45:41,164
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought back the chicken strips at McDonald's though.

1199
01:45:41,404 --> 01:45:41,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?

1200
01:45:41,904 --> 01:45:42,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of cool.

1201
01:45:42,844 --> 01:45:43,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're back.

1202
01:45:44,602 --> 01:45:46,583
[SPEAKER_01]: They call them McCrispies now.

1203
01:45:47,563 --> 01:45:48,503
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the same thing.

1204
01:45:48,963 --> 01:45:50,984
[SPEAKER_04]: If they cook them well enough.

1205
01:45:51,224 --> 01:45:54,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the one I had today, they overcooked them.

1206
01:45:54,345 --> 01:45:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very dry.

1207
01:45:55,785 --> 01:45:58,026
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can happen.

1208
01:45:58,286 --> 01:46:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So were they McCrumbly instead of McCrispy?

1209
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:04,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack in the Box Del Taco

1210
01:46:17,907 --> 01:46:18,967
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as Del Taco lives.

1211
01:46:37,895 --> 01:46:38,495
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1212
01:46:55,101 --> 01:47:08,335
[SPEAKER_04]: and when when he came out uh he's like I must I have to go to a Taco Bell because like the nearest one is like way over here in Australia and I'm like no we're taking you to Del Taco and there were no spots

1213
01:47:10,495 --> 01:47:11,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Jack in the Box

1214
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:30,071
[SPEAKER_04]: All kind of code violations until it finally just went away.

1215
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:30,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do.

1216
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:32,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm not being paid to say it.

1217
01:47:32,831 --> 01:47:39,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think it's the best fast food because they have such a diverse menu that there's so many things you can get there.

1218
01:47:39,512 --> 01:47:42,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, you can think that they... Usually I'll say, oh, Jack in the Box.

1219
01:47:42,613 --> 01:47:43,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Jack in the Box.

1220
01:47:43,193 --> 01:47:46,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And somebody will instantly reply with, they have the shittiest tacos.

1221
01:47:46,734 --> 01:47:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

1222
01:47:47,214 --> 01:47:48,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know there's like... They do.

1223
01:47:48,314 --> 01:47:54,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, tacos are like one thing on their menu of like 200 items because it completely caters to stoners.

1224
01:47:54,836 --> 01:47:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Then order something else.

1225
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: There's...

1226
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:57,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of things.

1227
01:47:57,977 --> 01:48:05,063
[SPEAKER_04]: They have better things, but I got really grossed out by their tacos when I could see how much grease was dripping off of them.

1228
01:48:05,183 --> 01:48:06,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a river.

1229
01:48:06,685 --> 01:48:08,586
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an empanada.

1230
01:48:08,646 --> 01:48:09,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It's deep fried.

1231
01:48:09,527 --> 01:48:09,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1232
01:48:14,312 --> 01:48:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm going to eat food so greasy it's going to make me sick, I'm going to go to Jim Boy's.

1233
01:48:17,876 --> 01:48:19,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say Jim Boy's is the taco you eat.

1234
01:48:20,019 --> 01:48:23,304
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't care about your insides.

1235
01:48:23,324 --> 01:48:30,513
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get to Blue Sky because I did put a bleed up earlier and a lot of you were very good at responding to it.

1236
01:48:30,533 --> 01:48:31,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1237
01:48:31,694 --> 01:48:36,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a bleed up over on our Blue Sky, which is at orangelaundradio.com.

1238
01:48:36,337 --> 01:48:39,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We're verified by domain name, so you just look for orangelaundradio.com.

1239
01:48:40,279 --> 01:48:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And we asked on Blue Sky this week, for those of you that attempted a pre-order on Switch 2, how was that experience for you?

1240
01:48:47,703 --> 01:48:51,625
[SPEAKER_07]: and for those of you that didn't pre-order the console, what made you a no or a not now?

1241
01:48:51,686 --> 01:48:57,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to include everybody and fully realize there's a lot of people that were a no or just can't do it right now.

1242
01:48:57,989 --> 01:48:59,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So we wanted to hear from both sides.

1243
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:03,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dark Dead Sea starts us off saying, it all comes down to the money situation.

1244
01:49:03,773 --> 01:49:07,775
[SPEAKER_07]: $4.99 is a pretty tall ask and the most we'll be paying for one of these this generation.

1245
01:49:08,276 --> 01:49:13,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So mostly just crossing our fingers that somewhere we'll have one when early June rolls around and just split the cost of one then.

1246
01:49:14,219 --> 01:49:19,201
[SPEAKER_07]: and hopefully down the line get a second one so we won't have to share one but we'll start with the one and go from there.

1247
01:49:19,521 --> 01:49:31,906
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that's a really realistic perspective and I think part of the important reason for asking this question is that many of us need to realize that being able to just drop $500 on one of these is a privilege.

1248
01:49:32,186 --> 01:49:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it is not something that everybody is going to be able to afford out the gate.

1249
01:49:36,648 --> 01:49:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I will never forget years ago

1250
01:49:40,342 --> 01:49:41,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1251
01:49:55,658 --> 01:49:55,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hey.

1252
01:49:55,978 --> 01:49:56,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1253
01:50:22,682 --> 01:50:24,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamer is one who games.

1254
01:50:25,103 --> 01:50:25,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1255
01:50:26,083 --> 01:50:29,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say one who games the PlayStation 50,000.

1256
01:50:29,364 --> 01:50:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1257
01:50:30,765 --> 01:50:33,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's one who games.

1258
01:50:33,146 --> 01:50:33,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1259
01:50:33,966 --> 01:50:38,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And in time, there will be secondhand versions of this and the price will come down and so forth.

1260
01:50:38,728 --> 01:50:43,129
[SPEAKER_07]: As gaming enthusiasts, we have to talk about the latest and greatest because it's where the industry is going.

1261
01:50:43,409 --> 01:50:49,792
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'll notice all of us, and maybe that's part of what draws some of you to our show, all of us have a soft spot for retro.

1262
01:50:50,052 --> 01:50:50,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Like hard.

1263
01:50:50,652 --> 01:50:50,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1264
01:50:51,092 --> 01:50:52,133
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1265
01:51:07,690 --> 01:51:10,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, not everybody wants to even if they can't.

1266
01:51:10,231 --> 01:51:10,631
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1267
01:51:11,191 --> 01:51:13,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't have to.

1268
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:22,635
[SPEAKER_07]: So Red Entertainment also is in the no camp saying not now as I didn't realistically think I'd be able to get one and I'm not apt to jump through hoops to get it.

1269
01:51:23,195 --> 01:51:26,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, this statement could apply to any recent gaming console upon release.

1270
01:51:26,836 --> 01:51:27,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1271
01:51:27,637 --> 01:51:29,257
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 5s were impossible to get.

1272
01:51:29,357 --> 01:51:31,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get a PlayStation 5 for years after the fact.

1273
01:51:32,638 --> 01:51:34,419
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't make me any less of a gamer, I don't think.

1274
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:36,221
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time I could get one, I didn't care.

1275
01:51:36,562 --> 01:51:37,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

1276
01:51:37,982 --> 01:51:44,064
[SPEAKER_07]: PodCulture replied to us on Blue Sky saying, I really want one, but got to get past the hailstorm damage to the house fix first.

1277
01:51:44,124 --> 01:51:46,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, priorities, right?

1278
01:51:46,165 --> 01:51:46,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes sense.

1279
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:48,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of no's.

1280
01:51:49,225 --> 01:51:52,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of no's because Mike Deft says, I didn't pre-order.

1281
01:51:52,366 --> 01:51:53,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I don't want the console.

1282
01:51:54,627 --> 01:51:56,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's worth the price of the mission in the US.

1283
01:51:57,548 --> 01:51:59,949
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the problem is Mike Deft is in Mexico.

1284
01:52:01,064 --> 01:52:08,969
[SPEAKER_07]: In Mexico, the Mario Kart World bundle being just over $750 is insane, and that's not even the tariffs.

1285
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:18,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because the distributor for anything Nintendo-related, Latamel, I guess is the company, they inflate the prices by a lot sometimes, but the Switch 2 prices really took the cake.

1286
01:52:19,495 --> 01:52:23,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, I'll just wait for when I can afford to get one, whether it's at launch or by the end of the year.

1287
01:52:23,918 --> 01:52:25,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not in a hurry to get it, so...

1288
01:52:26,513 --> 01:52:29,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very realistic perspective of not being in the U.S.

1289
01:52:29,735 --> 01:52:30,095
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.

1290
01:52:30,496 --> 01:52:39,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard from our old pal Megzi on Blue Sky who said, I fell asleep Wednesday night and completely missed the first round of pre-orders.

1291
01:52:40,042 --> 01:52:42,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when I tried to pre-order through GameStop, the website crashed.

1292
01:52:43,404 --> 01:52:50,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, I have a GameStop right by my apartment and a very chill boss, so I took a few hours of vacation from work to go wait in line in person.

1293
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:55,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It took a few hours waiting, but I got the pre-order plus a giant Sonic plush.

1294
01:52:56,893 --> 01:53:19,373
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know Megzi is a big fan of the Sonic movies recently I think Megzi and Tiger Claw have a lot in common in that department uh so I love that Megzi got uh their Sonic 3 plushie is is wonderful so uh great thanks it's good to hear from you Megzi I hope you're doing well uh we also have okay this is from Roto 13 on Blue Sky but I fucking love the name called the shitty Gatsby

1295
01:53:21,483 --> 01:53:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1296
01:53:21,923 --> 01:53:34,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the great Gatsby, but their cousin, the shitty Gatsby, who says, I stood in line with 100 people for hours at GameStop, but apparently I didn't need to because they still had pre-orders available as of late this morning.

1297
01:53:34,149 --> 01:53:35,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard that a lot of GameStops.

1298
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:39,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So those of you that still want one, call GameStop.

1299
01:53:40,072 --> 01:53:41,133
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be surprised.

1300
01:53:42,153 --> 01:53:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop has a tracker up here in Canada, and a lot of stores still have at least a few left.

1301
01:53:48,795 --> 01:53:56,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Vigetto EX, another name I haven't seen in a long time, good to hear from you, says, had one in my Target cart, but couldn't check out all night long due to errors.

1302
01:53:56,777 --> 01:53:58,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody that experienced what Loki had.

1303
01:53:58,878 --> 01:54:01,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Best Buy silently kicked me out of its queue multiple times.

1304
01:54:02,198 --> 01:54:03,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart worked out.

1305
01:54:03,339 --> 01:54:06,580
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point, it offered me the chance to buy and bought no problem.

1306
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:10,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Managed to get a second next day via GameStop's dumpster fire sale.

1307
01:54:10,981 --> 01:54:11,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1308
01:54:12,858 --> 01:54:13,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, JoshBet.

1309
01:54:13,538 --> 01:54:14,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that it's a dumpster fire.

1310
01:54:14,619 --> 01:54:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1311
01:54:15,659 --> 01:54:18,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Always a pleasure to hear from JoshBet over on Blue Sky who says,

1312
01:54:37,347 --> 01:54:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend was less lucky and had to pay attention for several hours and multiple websites broke and deleted his payment information, address, etc.

1313
01:54:45,034 --> 01:54:46,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So he had to keep actively trying.

1314
01:54:46,715 --> 01:54:48,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It even refused a payment option.

1315
01:54:48,597 --> 01:54:50,559
[SPEAKER_07]: He finally got one after two plus hours.

1316
01:54:50,899 --> 01:54:52,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Was surprised there were still some there.

1317
01:54:53,283 --> 01:54:56,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so apparently it might have gotten a little easier.

1318
01:54:56,325 --> 01:54:57,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what happened there.

1319
01:54:57,986 --> 01:54:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard from Coral Rose.

1320
01:54:59,627 --> 01:55:00,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Ms.

1321
01:55:00,347 --> 01:55:04,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Coral Rose, who says, I tried at Target and their site was quite broken.

1322
01:55:04,749 --> 01:55:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to place an order.

1323
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:07,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It was canceled a minute or so later.

1324
01:55:08,311 --> 01:55:10,793
[SPEAKER_07]: I also tried Best Buy and was successful there.

1325
01:55:11,293 --> 01:55:15,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope there's at least one more round of preorders like Sony did with the 30th anniversary PlayStation 5.

1326
01:55:16,015 --> 01:55:16,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Much nicer.

1327
01:55:17,813 --> 01:55:20,616
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard from Markito over on Blue Sky who said, Yep.

1328
01:55:37,768 --> 01:55:38,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I knew too.

1329
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:40,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of reason.

1330
01:55:57,685 --> 01:55:58,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Target was a nightmare.

1331
01:55:58,806 --> 01:56:00,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it in the cart but could never check out.

1332
01:56:00,687 --> 01:56:01,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Kept getting error after error.

1333
01:56:01,988 --> 01:56:03,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I snagged there was the camera.

1334
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:07,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart and Best Buy were mostly a matter of waiting around for something to happen.

1335
01:56:07,693 --> 01:56:12,516
[SPEAKER_07]: One Walmart window let me through to the product page but would give me an error when I tried to add it to the cart.

1336
01:56:12,877 --> 01:56:16,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Kept trying for the entire 10 minute window they gave you but nothing.

1337
01:56:16,519 --> 01:56:18,201
[SPEAKER_07]: After that, everything went pretty smoothly.

1338
01:56:19,696 --> 01:56:22,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Our pal Slaggy McWaggy from the Gamebuoy.org podcast.

1339
01:56:22,938 --> 01:56:23,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1340
01:56:23,999 --> 01:56:26,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen to Gamebuoy.org if you're not already.

1341
01:56:26,661 --> 01:56:31,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Says, dealt with target site breaking, got one to go through, and it immediately got canceled.

1342
01:56:32,304 --> 01:56:36,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart went pretty smoothly and was able to get a secure one, but not for launch day delivery.

1343
01:56:36,507 --> 01:56:40,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Tried on Best Buy, got kicked out of the queue, but it ended up working out, so I canceled my Walmart one.

1344
01:56:41,511 --> 01:56:49,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Walmart's process was by far the smoothest, but Best Buy was my preferred retailer, so I could get it in person, and I'm not a fan of the others for reasons.

1345
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:54,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm glad it worked out the way it did and consider myself very fortunate that I was able to get one.

1346
01:56:55,220 --> 01:57:03,667
[SPEAKER_07]: And then OhMyDolly, which is Dolly Partner, says, I guess I was one of the lucky ones.

1347
01:57:03,787 --> 01:57:05,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I managed to pre-order one.

1348
01:57:05,348 --> 01:57:12,034
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually reminds me, I took a picture of a Dolly mural downtown that I was going to bleat out to Dolly Partner.

1349
01:57:12,074 --> 01:57:13,134
[SPEAKER_07]: This reminds me I need to do it.

1350
01:57:13,595 --> 01:57:13,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

1351
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:15,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I will.

1352
01:57:16,478 --> 01:57:17,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I was one of the lucky ones.

1353
01:57:17,999 --> 01:57:23,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I managed to pre-order one from Target right at 12.01am, and so far it hasn't been cancelled.

1354
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:30,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen lots of people saying they've got cancellation emails, so I've been avoiding checking my email, but I do keep an eye on the Target app.

1355
01:57:30,701 --> 01:57:34,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I've been feeling pretty guilty for using them because of all the evil shit they've been doing.

1356
01:57:36,163 --> 01:57:37,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that, but like...

1357
01:57:41,121 --> 01:57:43,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of problematic shit going on in this country right now.

1358
01:57:44,442 --> 01:57:47,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And ultimately, it's because of the guy in charge.

1359
01:57:47,823 --> 01:57:49,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get really frustrated.

1360
01:57:49,363 --> 01:57:52,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand if people want to boycott Target or whatever they're boycotting.

1361
01:57:52,404 --> 01:57:55,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm glad people called it out.

1362
01:57:55,084 --> 01:57:57,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Walmart has just as many problematic issues.

1363
01:57:57,425 --> 01:58:02,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure there is something wrong with Best Buy that we just aren't hearing about on a mass scale, but we'll hear eventually.

1364
01:58:03,226 --> 01:58:10,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we'll hear about it then too because it just feels, you know, again, we're living in a there's no ethical consumption in capitalism type of era.

1365
01:58:10,988 --> 01:58:18,813
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I do get frustrated when I hear people that are screaming, you need to boycott Target, and then they didn't vote in the last election.

1366
01:58:19,853 --> 01:58:38,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the easiest way to have prevented a worldwide backlash, or not, I'm sorry, not worldwide, that was the wrong word, my apologies, a nationwide, which sometimes feels like the world and the trickle-down effect things have, a nationwide backlash, or whatever you want to call it, on DEI,

1367
01:58:39,184 --> 01:58:47,127
[SPEAKER_07]: is because of who got elected and all these executive orders and all this bullshit that they're putting out there threatening to pull all this stuff because heaven forbid.

1368
01:58:47,147 --> 01:58:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1369
01:58:49,308 --> 01:58:54,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess maybe that's why worldwide was the first word that came to my mind, even though let's not kid ourselves.

1370
01:58:54,531 --> 01:59:00,193
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a problem of who people elected or were voting for.

1371
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:04,115
[SPEAKER_07]: The time to have fought back against this was at the voting booth.

1372
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:08,276
[SPEAKER_07]: But y'all were finding problems with Kamala.

1373
01:59:08,296 --> 01:59:12,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all wanted to bring these problems to Kamala as if the needle could have never been moved.

1374
01:59:12,537 --> 01:59:15,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all wanted to say she was an imperfect candidate, therefore she should win.

1375
01:59:16,338 --> 01:59:16,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And now here we are.

1376
01:59:18,959 --> 01:59:20,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, you played yourselves.

1377
01:59:20,579 --> 01:59:22,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope y'all learned your lesson for next time.

1378
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:31,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just, I'm sorry, but like, and again, I understand, I respect why people feel the need to boycott Target.

1379
01:59:31,742 --> 01:59:33,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to fix the problems in this country.

1380
01:59:39,815 --> 01:59:42,316
[SPEAKER_07]: We did get some last minute answers here.

1381
01:59:42,996 --> 01:59:45,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, SGO100Matt says, but her laugh was strange.

1382
01:59:46,077 --> 01:59:56,039
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also fully realized she was the best candidate that could have possibly happened in 100 days.

1383
01:59:56,439 --> 02:00:00,040
[SPEAKER_07]: 47 has been in office longer than Kamala Harris ran for office.

1384
02:00:00,841 --> 02:00:02,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that into perspective a little bit.

1385
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,100
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1386
02:00:33,929 --> 02:00:42,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress could get rid of the tariff tomorrow Congress could fix a lot of the problems with the DEI backlash tomorrow but they won't

1387
02:00:44,894 --> 02:00:48,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Right says, I ended up getting lucky at Best Buy so far anyway.

1388
02:00:48,917 --> 02:00:55,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I managed to reload Best Buy at the exact right time, clicked the checkout button, got in line, waited for 40 minutes, and eventually it went through.

1389
02:00:56,581 --> 02:00:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I tried other stores at the same time to triple my chances.

1390
02:01:00,164 --> 02:01:08,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Target kept giving me errors until it sold out, and I got out of line at Walmart because I heard just getting a non-bundle would check out normally, which yes, sold out.

1391
02:01:09,873 --> 02:01:11,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for your responses on social media.

1392
02:01:11,897 --> 02:01:14,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to ask those questions more often because we had a very nice response.

1393
02:01:14,743 --> 02:01:16,226
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you all on Blue Sky.

1394
02:01:16,246 --> 02:01:16,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1395
02:01:17,488 --> 02:01:19,552
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's up with me having to do all the reading now?

1396
02:01:19,592 --> 02:01:20,854
[SPEAKER_07]: This is supposed to be Jamie's job.

1397
02:01:22,687 --> 02:01:49,069
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's not the mail but it no but no it is and you know I'm just giving you shit but it's one of those things where it's like wow we really are getting away from a lot of these forms of media it really is turning into short form social media it's just another example of that so anyway all right well one person will still turn to here is Loki I've decided I'm sorry I made a decision okay if someone wants to know my thoughts on something they can fucking ask me and I will tell them

1398
02:01:50,745 --> 02:01:57,492
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on Diet Coke vs. Diet Pepsi?

1399
02:01:57,512 --> 02:01:58,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Diet Pepsi, all the way.

1400
02:01:58,273 --> 02:01:58,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck Coke.

1401
02:02:10,936 --> 02:02:12,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1402
02:02:13,298 --> 02:02:14,399
[SPEAKER_07]: As I drink a Coke Zero.

1403
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:17,161
[SPEAKER_07]: But in my defense, this is one of those orange cream Coke Zeros.

1404
02:02:17,241 --> 02:02:17,861
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really good.

1405
02:02:18,041 --> 02:02:19,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Those aren't very good either.

1406
02:02:19,342 --> 02:02:20,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the Oreo ones.

1407
02:02:21,904 --> 02:02:22,184
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1408
02:02:23,145 --> 02:02:23,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1409
02:02:23,365 --> 02:02:24,626
[SPEAKER_07]: The Oreo ones are fucking great.

1410
02:02:24,886 --> 02:02:25,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they'd bring those back.

1411
02:02:25,847 --> 02:02:28,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadow, your job is in jeopardy now.

1412
02:02:28,409 --> 02:02:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not call the boss a heathen.

1413
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:32,251
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1414
02:02:34,293 --> 02:02:35,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Terrible soda all you want.

1415
02:02:36,437 --> 02:02:36,797
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1416
02:02:36,837 --> 02:02:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: More terrible soda for you.

1417
02:02:37,877 --> 02:02:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1418
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:41,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to the boss of last minute stories.

1419
02:02:41,258 --> 02:02:42,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, anything for us tonight?

1420
02:02:44,599 --> 02:02:47,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you're muted because I see the mouth moving, but nothing's happening.

1421
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:54,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, yeah, we're on top of all of the most critical news when it comes to modern consoles.

1422
02:02:55,281 --> 02:03:03,924
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have to tell you that your brand new Wii system, unfortunately, the Homebrew channel is no longer to be in development.

1423
02:03:04,144 --> 02:03:05,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get it.

1424
02:03:05,164 --> 02:03:05,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

1425
02:03:06,397 --> 02:03:09,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Several months or years ago.

1426
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:22,888
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, it's been revealed that apparently threading an OS implementation in one of the libraries was stolen.

1427
02:03:23,849 --> 02:03:35,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And the authors of LiboGC, they didn't just steal proprietary Nintendo code, but also saw fit to steal open source RTOS and remove all attribution and copyright information.

1428
02:03:37,578 --> 02:03:38,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought?

1429
02:03:38,379 --> 02:03:42,402
[SPEAKER_01]: In the piracy world, there's people willing to steal things.

1430
02:03:42,902 --> 02:03:48,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially we know there was some big leaks out of Nintendo not long ago, so it kind of adds up a little bit.

1431
02:03:49,887 --> 02:03:50,527
[SPEAKER_07]: The plot thickens.

1432
02:03:51,721 --> 02:03:51,961
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1433
02:03:52,681 --> 02:03:56,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if that's it, then we will say thank you so much for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1434
02:03:56,123 --> 02:03:57,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for being here tonight.

1435
02:03:57,243 --> 02:03:57,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate you.

1436
02:03:58,004 --> 02:04:02,166
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to continue the conversation throughout the week, join our Discord server, vognetwork.com.

1437
02:04:02,206 --> 02:04:04,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1438
02:04:04,547 --> 02:04:05,947
[SPEAKER_07]: We're happy to talk to you throughout the week.

1439
02:04:06,968 --> 02:04:09,809
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, help us spread the word.

1440
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:12,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell a friend or two about the show.

1441
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:15,892
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1442
02:04:15,952 --> 02:04:22,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to all the voices we heard tonight, whether through chat, whether through Blue Sky, whether through Carrier Pigeon, or however you're interacting with this show.

1443
02:04:22,716 --> 02:04:23,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for that.

1444
02:04:23,856 --> 02:04:26,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether through shipped Commodore 64s, which I still can't believe.

1445
02:04:26,338 --> 02:04:27,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for that.

1446
02:04:27,838 --> 02:04:35,562
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice five-star review goes a long way as well, either on Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Spotify, wherever you're finding this show.

1447
02:04:35,923 --> 02:04:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: All of that goes a very long way.

1448
02:04:37,243 --> 02:04:38,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1449
02:04:38,804 --> 02:04:40,285
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, we're going to wrap it up for tonight.

1450
02:04:40,646 --> 02:04:41,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, are you streaming tonight?

1451
02:04:42,227 --> 02:04:42,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually don't know.

1452
02:04:42,767 --> 02:04:44,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I am for a little bit.

1453
02:04:45,269 --> 02:04:49,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to drink some Scottish soda on stream unless somebody drank it already.

1454
02:04:50,833 --> 02:04:54,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to give us your final thoughts then?

1455
02:04:54,475 --> 02:04:55,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tired.

1456
02:04:56,365 --> 02:05:02,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tired Tired of love uninspired I'm tired of love uninspired

1457
02:05:27,308 --> 02:05:27,989
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1458
02:05:29,191 --> 02:05:29,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1459
02:05:29,571 --> 02:05:33,937
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought tonight is... Oh, I am going on a quick trip next weekend.

1460
02:05:33,977 --> 02:05:36,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be running to the show last minute.

1461
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:41,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So, by the way, I forgot to tell you and Jamie, the show is going to be very last minute next week because I'm going to LA.

1462
02:05:41,788 --> 02:05:42,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, because, because...

1463
02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:45,131
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to see Kylie Minogue again.

1464
02:05:45,691 --> 02:05:47,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Kylie Minogue on Tuesday.

1465
02:05:48,413 --> 02:05:49,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It was such a good show.

1466
02:05:49,414 --> 02:05:51,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It was such a good show, especially for an arena show.

1467
02:05:52,356 --> 02:05:53,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the best time.

1468
02:05:54,197 --> 02:05:55,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Kylie.

1469
02:05:55,898 --> 02:05:57,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, she's great.

1470
02:05:58,299 --> 02:05:59,500
[SPEAKER_07]: What's better than seeing her once?

1471
02:05:59,580 --> 02:06:00,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing her twice.

1472
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,882
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my friends was like, I want to go to LA to see her again.

1473
02:06:03,062 --> 02:06:05,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, so do I. We're going to go.

1474
02:06:05,804 --> 02:06:07,605
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to LA to see her again.

1475
02:06:07,665 --> 02:06:10,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're thinking about going to the Universal Fan Nights.

1476
02:06:11,147 --> 02:06:13,308
[SPEAKER_07]: because I want to see the Star Trek thing.

1477
02:06:14,549 --> 02:06:17,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And my friend that is meeting us in LA is from the Star Trek cruise.

1478
02:06:18,171 --> 02:06:19,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So we might go Star Trek together.

1479
02:06:20,493 --> 02:06:21,353
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to do that.

1480
02:06:21,573 --> 02:06:22,554
[SPEAKER_07]: The concert's Friday.

1481
02:06:22,574 --> 02:06:27,377
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do Friday, Saturday, and then drive home Sunday in a rush and get back in time for the show.

1482
02:06:27,557 --> 02:06:28,037
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the plan.

1483
02:06:29,838 --> 02:06:30,119
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1484
02:06:30,519 --> 02:06:30,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds busy.

1485
02:06:31,179 --> 02:06:37,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's going to be busy, but I'm still living my life like I'm in my mid-20s, and one of these days I'm probably going to be very unhappy with that decision.

1486
02:06:38,005 --> 02:06:39,946
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, I'm having a great time.

1487
02:06:40,366 --> 02:06:42,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So until then, have a great week, everybody.

1488
02:06:42,788 --> 02:06:44,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We will see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1489
02:06:45,150 --> 02:06:45,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a wonderful week.

1490
02:06:46,171 --> 02:06:47,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.
