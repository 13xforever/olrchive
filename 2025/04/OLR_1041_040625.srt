1
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:13,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave some thought to rerunning an intro for the first time in the show's history.

2
00:00:13,322 --> 00:00:21,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I was sick at the time I recorded it, I wasn't sick enough that I couldn't have recorded a full intro, but my voice was still scratchy at the time, but it wasn't an indication of my ability to put in more effort.

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sick now, not for lack of vocal fry when I get into my deeper, dulcet tones and incredibly close to the mic.

4
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoops, maybe I should have re-ran the intro.

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,082
[SPEAKER_07]: At least then I would have actually referenced gaming news.

6
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Direct wasn't an April Fool.

7
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:41,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rub Rubber, it's Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you about the Switch 2, Nintendo Direct, and the rest of some gaming news.

8
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a place.

9
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:52,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm laughing because I don't know what Jason was doing with that intro, but it was really funny.

11
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:07,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1041 of our show for tonight, April the 6th of 2025.

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,415
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I do want to get right into the news here pretty quickly, but I couldn't do that if I didn't say hello first to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:25,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, one thing I want to ask you here at the top of the show is is that new killer in Dead by Daylight breaking the game?

14
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:39,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired of him already at least when I played had nothing but him but there's some OP stuff about this character that has been addressed by a number of

15
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:43,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Upper Echelon, DBD People

16
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: On a scale of one to five stars, what would you give the Minecraft movie?

17
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,488
[SPEAKER_05]: At least four stars.

18
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,049
[SPEAKER_05]: At least four stars.

19
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:16,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

20
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,470
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.

21
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,111
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not bad.

22
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,292
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a B. That's a solid B.

23
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:24,959
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

24
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,868
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:03,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start off at the top here.

26
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'm going to turn it over to you to give us the news rundowns.

27
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:12,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But could we talk about the two things that people are talking about the most after that direct?

28
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And they both revolve around the price.

29
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:18,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we talk about, first, the price of the system and the price of the games?

30
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:28,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the price of the system is $450 for just the system itself, only the system.

31
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:36,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're also doing a limited time bundle with Mario Kart World Tour, which is the brand new Mario Kart game, for $499.

32
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:37,996
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's in the US.

33
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:55,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe similar pricing in Japan the pricing is much lower due to the weak yen there apparently but that is basically the price point it's close to a digital version of the PlayStation 5.

34
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:04,603
[SPEAKER_08]: On top of that Mario Kart World Tour the launch game for the Switch 2

35
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:17,319
[SPEAKER_08]: is retailing at $80 essentially, or $70 digital, $80 physical, although some regions it's $80 and $90.

36
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I had heard it was $80 for both, that it's $80 digital, $80 physical as well.

37
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more for physical.

38
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:31,751
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big problem like that Nintendo has right now.

39
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:39,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo screwed up big time, big time by not being more transparent about the pricing in the direct.

40
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand.

41
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:41,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I know before y'all come at me and chat.

42
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:48,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that Direct has to be in the can for weeks in advance so that it gets the legal review so that they get everything prepped.

43
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a lot of instability going on in the world.

44
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand there's certain things that Nintendo has to have.

45
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:59,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But then that also kind of makes me go, well, should Nintendo maybe have done it live?

46
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

47
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is filling in the gaps.

48
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've said this time and time again on Orange Lounge Radio.

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,045
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a truth that we have to accept about our industry, the gaming industry, that is so extraordinarily frustrating.

50
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the truth doesn't matter.

51
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: The truth doesn't matter.

52
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:41,815
[SPEAKER_05]: The perception of the news, the perception of the truth is what matters.

53
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,033
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:07,379
[SPEAKER_05]: As I was doing later that evening, I was brain rotting on TikTok, which a lot of us do sometimes.

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Brain rotting on whatever app it is of your choice.

56
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:17,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I was brain rotting on TikTok, and I saw the TikToks where people were like, I can't believe that Mario Kart World Tour is going to be $90 if you want a cartridge.

57
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

58
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be $90.

59
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:26,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually go... And I saw a bleat on Blue Sky from somebody I know very well.

60
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:28,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe Mario Kart's going to be $90.

61
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:33,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And I linked the Best Buy screenshot where it's $80 for the physical edition of the game.

62
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know!

63
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,504
[SPEAKER_05]: because Nintendo really fucked up not being clear.

64
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand the situation is extraordinarily complicated and it's fluid, but unfortunately the reality of the situation is now perception has taken over.

65
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:54,561
[SPEAKER_05]: We barely know what the price is.

66
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:58,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that the MSRP is $79.99.

67
00:06:58,343 --> 00:07:02,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we don't know if that's digital only or if that's going to be a physical edition.

68
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,409
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, it is $79.99.

69
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't matter how you slice it.

70
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it's digital or physical doesn't matter.

71
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: $79.99 is $10 more...

72
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:42,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they have They have broken that ceiling They have pushed, and yeah, I think a lot of people were not expecting that to come from Nintendo From the bottom of my heart, let me be the first to say to Nintendo Not the first, I'm sure, but let me be another person to say to Nintendo Absolutely, wholeheartedly, go fuck yourselves

73
00:07:43,864 --> 00:08:04,114
[SPEAKER_08]: 100% fuck yourselves with the sharpest fucking rigidity shit that you have because god damn it you fucking just ruined the god damn game industry by saying oh hey Ubisoft threw shitty fucking Assassin's Creed games now those are gonna be $80 because Nintendo said it was okay so now we get to fucking just open that gate fuck you guys fuck you

74
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:08,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Some orange turd who decided tariffs were a good idea.

75
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:14,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I get you that you want to blame tariffs, but other games, even on their own platform, are $70, $80.

76
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,940
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it is Nintendo.

77
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,965
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Nintendo because it's not like that they live in a bubble and didn't know that tariffs are coming.

78
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:22,286
[SPEAKER_08]: And that aside...

79
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:28,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Other regions of the world where there are no tariffs from the United States, it is still that price.

80
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

81
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:30,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

82
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

83
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

84
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them with this bullshit.

85
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,131
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking greed and it's bullshit.

86
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:38,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And they need to fuck themselves.

87
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope they pay for this.

88
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:41,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I hope they pay for this.

89
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:45,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it will affect... This is going to be fucking PlayStation 3 all over the fuck again.

90
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,535
[SPEAKER_08]: In a recession in the worldwide.

91
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, fuck them.

92
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:56,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to address a couple comments in chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night.

93
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:02,061
[SPEAKER_05]: The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

94
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:10,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Deft in chat says, yeah, Nintendo did fuck up, but I think it's wrong of us that Nintendo is only to blame here.

95
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes and no.

96
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:19,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And Deft was commenting, I want to say that comment was kind of timed when I was talking about the messaging.

97
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:24,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I still believe Nintendo could have done a better job messaging in spite of the situation.

98
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of it is what you hear Loki say.

99
00:09:27,071 --> 00:09:36,035
[SPEAKER_05]: in his passionate voice there about, great, you've done Shattered the Glass Ceiling, this all but guarantees Grand Theft Auto 6 will be $80, if not more.

100
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:40,597
[SPEAKER_05]: This all but guarantees other Ubisoft games and other games, they're going to be $80.

101
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:43,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

102
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:44,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

103
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:45,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Glass Ceiling doesn't apply here.

104
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Shattered the Ceiling of price or whatever it is.

105
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I say that because there was this...

106
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:59,990
[SPEAKER_05]: This sort of unspoken, we're not going above this price and you can't charge this much for a video game.

107
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you can.

108
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:06,035
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even so much that Nintendo is charging it for their game.

109
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:10,539
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically giving the game industry permission to just fuck the consumer some more.

110
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:15,423
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was already ridiculous enough and we were already pushing it back against it with PlayStation 5.

111
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:22,789
[SPEAKER_08]: At least there you could justify that, oh, it's the 4K visuals that they need to push for these higher spec systems.

112
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:24,430
[SPEAKER_08]: The Switch 2 ain't that.

113
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: The Switch 2 is fucking a generation or two back, okay?

114
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine a PlayStation 4 game coming out for $80 retail.

115
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just... If Sony released Spider-Man on the PlayStation 4 for $80, everybody would be telling the fuck themselves.

116
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just ridiculous.

117
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And we give Nintendo a pass all the time.

118
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not giving Nintendo a pass.

119
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

120
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:52,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to play the new Mario Kart game, but this is ridiculous.

121
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,679
[SPEAKER_08]: It is way too... It's priced way too high.

122
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, Trump's tariffs are only going to make that even higher.

123
00:10:59,081 --> 00:10:59,602
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just...

124
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:18,364
[SPEAKER_08]: read the fucking room like the reason the switch did so well is because it was one of the lower price systems and that's how you got away with it but now you're just cash you're just pulling like some of these higher end you know electronics things where it's like well we've got the built-in consumer they'll pay whatever we want they'll they'll eat whatever we give them like it's just

125
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:38,162
[SPEAKER_08]: you gotta say no at some point you gotta just push back and let them go through this as like they did with the 3DS where that flopped initially and then they had to re the pivot and kind of make amends there because I honestly I think a lot of these game companies need to kind of have a comeuppance so this greed just goes away because it's getting ridiculous

126
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:41,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's not just... Because I get it with Nintendo.

127
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:44,368
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, yeah, you get a full complete package usually for their games.

128
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:45,649
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have a ton of DLC.

129
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:46,830
[SPEAKER_08]: It's usually pretty meaningful.

130
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, this isn't a Nintendo problem.

131
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:59,501
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be a game industry problem because now you have Ubisoft that's going to get... You're going to get EA, Sports, Madden coming out the door at $80 fucking dollars plus all the bullshit that they add on top of that.

132
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:05,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're going to be like, we don't have enough money while raking in billions of dollars and giving their fucking CEOs hundreds of millions of dollars.

133
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:06,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck that.

134
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo.

135
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:09,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this game industry, actually.

136
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:10,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

137
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:11,690
[SPEAKER_08]: All of them.

138
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:16,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not, there's actually a large portion of what Loki's saying I agree with.

139
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:18,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might surprise you.

140
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:22,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually try to be pretty measured in these types of situations.

141
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:28,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think this $80 is not going to be great news at the end of the day for the industry.

142
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have seen the...

143
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:43,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen the kind of the first line of defense that sometimes the Nintendo defenders are using in this situation about, well, the cartridges that we were buying in the 90s were, you know, such and such.

144
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: A Chrono Trigger was $100 or, you know, whatever, you know, cartridges had all this meat packed into $100 at this time.

145
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:51,772
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

146
00:12:52,472 --> 00:13:05,377
[SPEAKER_05]: and ding, ding, ding, a gold star comment as far as I'm concerned in this chat to Deft, who said the real problem isn't the games going up, it's our wages not going up.

147
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:16,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the comparison breaks down for me, is because if you look at what the minimum wage was then and what the minimum wage is now, there's a huge discrepancy there.

148
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:20,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be fair, this is indicative of a problem outside the gaming industry.

149
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:27,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also see the talk about the budgets for the video games going up and that it costs more to make a video game.

150
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:34,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Whilst I do understand that, it's a very hard pill to swallow when there isn't more money going into our pockets.

151
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we have to be able to have teams of...

152
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that's AI that helps with that.

153
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:49,095
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not generative in nature, but tools and learn.

154
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:50,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

155
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:54,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But this industry is headed for further disaster in this direction.

156
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And I fully believe it.

157
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be honest though.

158
00:13:58,988 --> 00:13:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's look at this.

159
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:04,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, we want to make the argument that games in the past were more expensive.

160
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,492
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's look at the reality of that is.

161
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:11,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the upfront cost of a game back then was maybe a bit more expensive.

162
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:14,577
[SPEAKER_08]: But you got a complete game with that.

163
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas now, everything is piecemealed out of it.

164
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:23,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Your entry point at these games is now getting to the point what those old complete games were.

165
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:28,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, that's not the complete game because then you gotta buy the fucking Battle Pass.

166
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:33,746
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a monthly subscription to unlock bullshit that would have normally been free.

167
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and then you got your special editions on top of all that.

168
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:40,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you got your DLC and your consumables on top of all of that.

169
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,131
[SPEAKER_08]: So no, it is not just like...

170
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,451
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an even deeper core to this.

171
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:18,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and even if we're talking like cartridges cost more to manufacture, okay, give me a discount on the digital game then.

172
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, it's the same price?

173
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:25,263
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's an even deeper core to deal- to do with this, and it's just the whole nature of capitalism.

174
00:15:27,418 --> 00:15:28,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Please elaborate.

175
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:34,643
[SPEAKER_03]: The absolute nature of capitalism and how rampant and unchecked it's become in this country.

176
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:45,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that some of these working protections that we have are now being rolled back, which is going to make things even worse for people trying to earn that living wage like Rob was mentioning.

177
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:49,634
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a...

178
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:05,227
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hate to draw the comparison but history has taught us look at the origins of the French Revolution about how that loaded up and it all came from the fact that you had a very separated and

179
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,086
[SPEAKER_03]: and many more.

180
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:48,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're dealing with this kind of disparaging income and the fact that now they are tooling things where they stand to make money from the actions, from the damage that the tariffs will cause the consumer.

181
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:52,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole lot of economic theory I'll have to go into and we don't have time on the show.

182
00:16:53,905 --> 00:17:19,069
[SPEAKER_03]: but that being said we are heading to that breaking point and the companies they don't see they just think they're gonna buy it our name is on it they're gonna buy it our name is on it or there's you know FOMO is gonna sell these systems you know and it might I mean honestly it might I mean it's

183
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:33,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think like $79.99 would have been more or like you know $69.99 would have been more palatable because at least then you'd be like okay well this is just where the industry's going everybody's raising their prices to that but then to take it even further come on

184
00:17:34,656 --> 00:17:43,863
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also, though, these people who are, you know, going to think like, you know, like there are people out there who say, okay, this is a natural progression.

185
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:44,944
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what inflation is.

186
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,365
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been through this cycle before.

187
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:47,766
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing new.

188
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:50,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And to an extent, it is nothing new.

189
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, we saw it coming.

190
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We had hoped it wouldn't, but we saw it coming.

191
00:17:56,312 --> 00:18:01,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We just didn't, I reckon, as a group, think it was going to happen so soon.

192
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And

193
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:09,183
[SPEAKER_03]: People will fuss, people will complain, and ultimately, they will still buy it.

194
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as that happens, nothing is going to change.

195
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:15,940
[SPEAKER_05]: That is true.

196
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,804
[SPEAKER_05]: People have to vote with their wallets, but I feel like this situation is going to continue to escalate, and I think people will.

197
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:28,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo infamously is a company that does not put games on sale, but I will say this.

198
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:34,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's two things I want to say because – let me say this, and then I want to get into where I actually disagree with Loki because I'm sure you all want to hear that.

199
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:43,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the one thing is that we – one thing we don't have on the table because we don't know what it looks like yet is what –

200
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:46,044
[SPEAKER_05]: What deals are we going to get on these $80 games?

201
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:52,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning, we all know that you can work the Costco system to get $100 of Nintendo cards for $90, at least today.

202
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one way you can save a buck on a game, because games are starting to push that price anyway.

203
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:02,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Another way you could save is that it used to be that if you had Nintendo Switch Online, you could get the...

204
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:30,381
[SPEAKER_05]: the voucher that would let you get two games and it was reduced price and so we don't know if any of those things are going to help swallow the pill of this and I would tell you if these games don't sell the way that Nintendo expects them to we'll probably see more of those types of deals and again I also want to emphasize you know the price of Mario Kart World is one thing but what really gets me

205
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

206
00:19:53,112 --> 00:20:01,755
[SPEAKER_05]: but otherwise on its own for a new consumer who doesn't have Breath of the Wild, which I really don't know who that is at this point, but we'll say there's somebody out there that doesn't.

207
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:15,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Asking them to pay $80 for Breath of the Wild in the year 2025, that's like Bethesda putting out a Skyrim Switch 2 edition saying we have a few extra quests, we have a phone app that goes with it, and they're going to charge you $80 for that.

208
00:20:17,677 --> 00:20:21,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big pill for Nintendo to swallow.

209
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:27,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And on top of that, I saw a side-by-side with the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions.

210
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:30,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly couldn't tell them apart.

211
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,048
[SPEAKER_08]: They looked the same.

212
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:39,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And being that these Switch 2 editions are essentially, it's a Switch 1 game and a voucher to download that update.

213
00:20:39,374 --> 00:20:40,135
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

214
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:47,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's where I start to disagree with Loki and even myself a little bit, because here's the thing.

215
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize optics are a big thing in play, right?

216
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that whole perception thing.

217
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I would actually argue many of you are already paying $80 for a video game.

218
00:20:56,483 --> 00:21:11,748
[SPEAKER_05]: You're already paying this price because so many companies out there, not only with their limited edition, legacy edition, you know, will find ways to jack the price up all the way to like $100 if you want to get, you know, the early access for its edition, all this stuff.

219
00:21:12,168 --> 00:21:17,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just that, but the fact that consider this, that Nintendo...

220
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only a dream.

221
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:42,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a Fuji Television Rights thing because Nintendo has re-put out Mario 2 several times.

222
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:46,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say Fuji Television because of Doki Doki Panic and where that all came from.

223
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:47,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the characters.

224
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I digress.

225
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:59,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other company, any other company, Ubisoft especially, I'm trying to think of who else especially, but especially Ubisoft.

226
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pick on them because EA would be another one.

227
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:17,684
[SPEAKER_05]: would have put out Mario Kart World Tour for $70 and then had the $10 character packs, five of them with five characters each and maybe have 25 in the game and then the extra packs that will be for sale with that.

228
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you want to unlock the special cup, that's also going to be a $15 piece of DLC and da-da-da-da-da.

229
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:33,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, and it's not that Nintendo doesn't do DLC, obviously they do, and I fully expect that Mario Kart World will probably have some of its own and so forth.

230
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do feel like where Nintendo has proven themselves is that the DLC that Nintendo releases tends to be the best value for the dollar.

231
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the only one I thought was kind of mid was Splatoon.

232
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, the DLC that Nintendo releases is usually...

233
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's enough to substantiate it.

234
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, but I understand.

235
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,996
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, it's the optics of the $80 price that is really bad.

236
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:04,902
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just feel like in another universe, Nintendo puts out Mario Kart World Tour with half the characters, then charges to the DLC.

237
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that really any different?

238
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not any different.

239
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:14,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But once again, we're still giving them the benefit of the doubt.

240
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:16,338
[SPEAKER_08]: But now they've gone and done this.

241
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows what they're capable of right now.

242
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:24,322
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, because we thought that it was going to be reasonably priced and everything.

243
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:30,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they went and said, hey, let's play a game and see how many of these we can sell for $80.

244
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:32,986
[SPEAKER_08]: And so now they're going to do that.

245
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And who knows what they're going to do on top of it.

246
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:37,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what their plan is, but...

247
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, I can't, I now have to lump them in with everybody else.

248
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, just because that's the way it is.

249
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:55,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel it was extremely a missed opportunity on Nintendo's part to not communicate why they felt the price of the game needed to go up.

250
00:23:56,055 --> 00:24:02,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, you know, and that could have even been damage control that they do after the fact in interviews and things like that.

251
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,442
[SPEAKER_05]: But we haven't really had a comment on that issue.

252
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:12,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Which again is leading to the internet completely filling in the gap and making it up.

253
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:20,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to present something because this is the type of behavior online that I'm so tired of.

254
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:22,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will get to your comments in chat.

255
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry I see you guys.

256
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:25,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to rant about something real quick, okay?

257
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:27,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to show you this Reddit.

258
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:33,000
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Reddit for gaming news where they post a bunch of headlines and you see things that get upvoted.

259
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

260
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:42,306
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the items that's on this Reddit is... Every first-party Nintendo Switch 2 game will cost $70 or $80, even the old ones, okay?

261
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo cites upgrades, inflation, and tariffs as reasons for the higher prices.

262
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:51,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from a website called techspot.com.

263
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was drawn to this headline because I said, wait a minute...

264
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has commented on this?

265
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:58,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not aware.

266
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:01,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see what Nintendo is saying about that $80.

267
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, you go to the site, it's the same headline.

268
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:08,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Every first party Nintendo Switch 2 game will cost $70 or $80, even the old ones.

269
00:25:09,147 --> 00:25:13,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo cites upgrades, inflation, and tariffs as reason for the higher prices.

270
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Just checking my eyes.

271
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:18,134
[SPEAKER_05]: That headline on this site does say Nintendo is citing this, right?

272
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:19,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We all see that.

273
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:19,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

274
00:25:20,643 --> 00:25:23,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Then as I'm moving down, I'm reading through the story.

275
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Nintendo is going to charge $80 for games.

276
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Shocking news about Mario Kart World is $80.

277
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, third-party titles will have varied pricing.

278
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:32,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

279
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:34,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo Scheme for updating.

280
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:34,990
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take this.

281
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, like PlayStation 5.

282
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

283
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft and third-party developers release upgrade patches.

284
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:40,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony charges $10.

285
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, we know that.

286
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:42,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Civ 7.

287
00:25:42,973 --> 00:25:43,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we know that.

288
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo didn't specify the price for Switch to Switch 2 conversions, but the difference is $10 to $20.

289
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, right, okay.

290
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still looking for Nintendo citing this.

291
00:25:56,616 --> 00:26:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, inflation alone could account for most or all the differences between AAA games that sold for $70 a few years ago and $80 Switch 2 games in 2025.

292
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,318
[SPEAKER_05]: According to labor statistics, $70 in 2021 or 2022 could equal between $75 or $80 today.

293
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:09,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

294
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still trying to get to that part of the story where Nintendo is citing the upgrades, inflation, or tariffs.

295
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's see, let's see.

296
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:34,759
[SPEAKER_05]: The 24% tariff on Nintendo's home country, Japan, and 46% tax on goods from Vietnam, where the firm shifted switch to manufacturing to avoid anti-Chinese duties, could be particularly troublesome.

297
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has likely already shipped many units into the US ahead of the tariffs, and Trump has wavered on the practice before, but the company is seemingly hedging its bets in an increasingly chaotic market.

298
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:55,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but that's... Okay, Nintendo, that's reading into the news in, I think, what is a reasonable way, but that's not Nintendo actually commenting on it, right?

299
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

300
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:56,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

301
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:59,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Avoiding tariffs by building Switch 2s in the US is also untenable.

302
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:05,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Analysts say building factories and hiring personnel would take five years and then the consoles would still cost more.

303
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:05,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

304
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,273
[SPEAKER_05]: It remains unclear how or if the video game industry will respond.

305
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,577
[SPEAKER_05]: A heavier focus on digital marketplace would be unsurprising.

306
00:27:12,037 --> 00:27:12,979
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end of the article.

307
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:15,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end of the article.

308
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:15,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

309
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I just kind of ran through the article there.

310
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:26,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you, correct me if I'm wrong, did you hear anything in there about Nintendo actually citing upgrades, inflation, and tariffs?

311
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:28,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear anything where Nintendo actually said something in that?

312
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:33,776
[SPEAKER_08]: No, what I heard was, sucker, you bought our Clickbait headline.

313
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:34,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

314
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:39,998
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, y'all, because, again, let's go back to Reddit, where this originally came from.

315
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:44,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to show you 160 comments.

316
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,539
[SPEAKER_05]: 146 people upvoted this.

317
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,821
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the article itself, you have 36 comments, or no, 26 comments, 468 likes and shares.

318
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:57,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

319
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I understand, Tigerclaw in chat, Reddit isn't reliable as a news source.

320
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:28,175
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm telling you the numbers of people that are spreading this like wildfire because it isn't fucking true.

321
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the stuff that is spreading everywhere.

322
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:34,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all need to stop and critically think.

323
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:39,441
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no comment from Nintendo on this, and that is the problem.

324
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

325
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It did, and people don't think at all.

326
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:01,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Think.

327
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:03,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Critical or not, people don't think.

328
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:03,929
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to think.

329
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to do the research for themselves.

330
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:21,993
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where all of you, me, all of you listening, all of you on websites like Reddit, all of you on Blue Sky, all of you that for whatever god-awful reason are still on Twitter, all of you that are on Facebook, all of it, this is what you all need to do better.

331
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop sharing this shit.

332
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:30,588
[SPEAKER_05]: and StopRewardingTechSpot for making shit up, literally.

333
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not doing anybody any favors.

334
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the part that really shocked me in a good way.

335
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:44,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go back to Reddit.

336
00:29:46,111 --> 00:29:48,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I know y'all are mad that I'm getting my news from Reddit.

337
00:29:49,651 --> 00:29:54,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Reddit is, again, I could go to Blue Sky and I would see that same article being shared.

338
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go to Twitter and I would see that same article being shared.

339
00:29:57,264 --> 00:30:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Reddit is one of many barometers about what people are talking about online, whether you like it or not.

340
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:07,305
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another article that's been shared, also funny enough, uploaded 146 times.

341
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:13,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Trump tariffs will have a real and detrimental impact on games industry, says U.S.

342
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:13,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Trade Group.

343
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:25,320
[SPEAKER_05]: This one goes to Eurogamer, which is a website that I trust a lot more based on track record to not be doing the AI drivel and to not do these clickbait headlines because they open it right off saying...

344
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:36,563
[SPEAKER_05]: The Entertainment Software Association, which represents all major gaming companies in the U.S., has responded to the Trump tariffs, saying the measures will have a real and detrimental impact on the game industry.

345
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:46,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And they link to the actual game file source here where ESA Senior Vice President Aubrey Quinn mentioned in an interview that the tariffs, quote,

346
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to Eurogamer for having the integrity to cite your source.

347
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:05,107
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

348
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:21,894
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

349
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:54,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what is the second headline about what the tariffs are doing to the Nintendo Switch situation?

350
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: The second headline?

351
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:05,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they've basically stopped the pre-orders because now the tariffs are going on.

352
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,472
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to basically reevaluate what I guess to charge everything.

353
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,896
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still supposed to come out on June 5th.

354
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:16,177
[SPEAKER_08]: At least.

355
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:19,266
[SPEAKER_08]: So that hasn't changed, but who knows when that's going to pre-order.

356
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Because originally it's supposed to start on Wednesday, on the 9th.

357
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:36,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, the whole pre-orders are going to happen, and now they're not, because... And this is the part to the comment that was said much earlier, how much of this is really Nintendo's fault.

358
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:47,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the part where it's like, yeah, this is just shitty timing, and the only fault Nintendo made was not getting this console out sooner, which I understand, you want to have the good games and all this stuff.

359
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:59,198
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is now they literally put out a Nintendo Direct the same day that our government decided to implement tariffs on nations based on an algorithm.

360
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't try and convince me this was not algorithm or AI or otherwise based because if it wasn't, we wouldn't be putting tariffs on the fucking Penguin Islands or whatever they're called in Australia.

361
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the U.S.

362
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:13,369
[SPEAKER_05]: base.

363
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there isn't any fucking people working.

364
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:17,393
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they importing from that island?

365
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Penguin meat?

366
00:33:18,253 --> 00:33:19,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's allowed.

367
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing.

368
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:23,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how you know.

369
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:29,364
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you know somebody who actually knows what they're talking about did not proofread this.

370
00:33:29,944 --> 00:33:35,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And that fucking somebody typed into Grok or one of those bullshit AI things.

371
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,794
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I tariff other countries in this whole thing?

372
00:33:41,426 --> 00:33:44,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo could not have called that that news would have come out the same day.

373
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give them a pass on that.

374
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:52,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And now this whole situation... It's homophobia against gay penguins.

375
00:33:54,177 --> 00:34:07,508
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing is so fucked because Nintendo, you may recall, moved a good chunk of their production of hardware out of China into Vietnam to get around the first round of Trump tariffs.

376
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time that targeted China.

377
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,471
[SPEAKER_05]: They moved them to Vietnam.

378
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:12,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

379
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:26,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Trump wants to target Vietnam with a 46% tariff, which has, again, the clickbait hysteria leading to $650 or $700 Nintendo Switch 2s, which at least is rooted in math.

380
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:34,809
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, nobody can really boil down exactly what parts are coming from where into which countries and imports and how that's all going to boil down.

381
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:36,190
[SPEAKER_05]: That would require...

382
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,131
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:58,375
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the type of news that changes on a whim.

384
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:01,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I fully expect we will come back to this show.

385
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:04,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe this is just false hope, silly hope.

386
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:06,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just feel like this is how our government works now.

387
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And change my mind.

388
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Please feel free.

389
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like we're going to come back here in seven days.

390
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:16,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And does Vietnam have a prime minister or president?

391
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:17,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't know.

392
00:35:17,664 --> 00:35:18,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, everybody.

393
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't keep track of every country in the world and their government.

394
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Vietnam have a prime minister or president?

395
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:33,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever the leader, whoever the de facto leader of Vietnam is in the next seven days will have kissed Trump's ring and kissed his ass on social media and convinced the administration to remove that tariff.

396
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:35,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And this this thing is going to be a nonstop.

397
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,481
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I really, truly think is going to happen.

398
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:41,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not in seven days, but I would say in like two weeks, maybe.

399
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby says they already have.

400
00:35:43,366 --> 00:35:44,307
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a prime minister.

401
00:35:44,347 --> 00:35:48,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, again, deals being brokered on social media because that's the government you elected.

402
00:35:52,802 --> 00:36:01,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that... Going back to your comment about algorithm for the record, I also think that there's quite a bit of bias involved in the choice of countries for this.

403
00:36:01,928 --> 00:36:02,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.

404
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:03,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sure.

405
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Bobby actually gives me a link here to look at this.

406
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:10,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Except...

407
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:16,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't let me read it unless I have a subscription.

408
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So I only have the headline here that says, Vietnam ready to remove U.S.

409
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:23,285
[SPEAKER_05]: import tariffs as it seeks to delay Trump's 46% levy.

410
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:27,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently there was a meeting between the ambassador, U.S.

411
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:30,912
[SPEAKER_05]: ambassador to Vietnam and Vietnam's minister of foreign affairs on Sunday.

412
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:39,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's already, and I'm sure there are many governments around the world, like I said, and maybe that was the plan, right?

413
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Question mark, I say as if there's ever a plan.

414
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:47,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not going to profess to be able to think like these people that are running our government.

415
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:48,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they're doing.

416
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:54,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But the stock market seems to indicate a lot of people don't think they know what they're doing.

417
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:57,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what the situation looks like in seven days.

418
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:02,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue, no matter how you slice it, let's say this issue is gone in seven days.

419
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:04,713
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to cause supply issues.

420
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:07,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Supply issues are already going to happen.

421
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:24,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And even when Nintendo has probably taken steps to get around those issues by already having Switch 2s in this country ready to go, the problem is that there's going to be a stoppage of bringing more into this country to sit in warehouses and go out to store shelves and be distributed.

422
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:27,334
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to cause a stoppage of that for weeks.

423
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:28,536
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

424
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:45,935
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

425
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:08,149
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

426
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:31,831
[SPEAKER_05]: You bet your ass you're going to be hearing this from Sony and you're going to hear this from Microsoft as well.

427
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:43,159
[SPEAKER_05]: They just have a little bit, you know, because the supply is already out there and their product isn't quite in high demand right this moment, they have the luxury of being able to kind of wait this out a little more than Nintendo does.

428
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:48,510
[SPEAKER_05]: and SSJ100Matt goes to elections have consequences.

429
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.

430
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And for all of you that said, I'm doing my Twitch stream and I don't talk about politics on my Twitch stream because we need to keep politics out of video games and we need to, the politics shouldn't touch the video games.

431
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

432
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

433
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:08,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always inevitable that politics was going to be tied to your video games.

434
00:39:08,786 --> 00:39:10,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It was always inevitable.

435
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:12,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe,

436
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe gamers needed this to happen.

437
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to say it.

438
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate watching a lot of this stuff that's playing out.

439
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how the fuck people are going to wake up until it hurts them personally.

440
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Because unfortunately, that seems to be the way this country works.

441
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,363
[SPEAKER_05]: People do not give a shit until it affects them personally.

442
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:31,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they give a shit.

443
00:39:32,883 --> 00:39:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe the price of the Switch 2 will finally be the thing that fucking radicalizes you.

444
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:39,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the resistance.

445
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,545
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been waiting for you.

446
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

447
00:39:48,691 --> 00:39:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

448
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:55,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's talk a little bit more about what exactly was announced regarding the Switch 2.

449
00:39:57,614 --> 00:40:00,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We know the price and we know that we're not happy with it.

450
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:05,797
[SPEAKER_08]: But, specs wise, it is going to be a pretty decent piece of kit.

451
00:40:05,977 --> 00:40:09,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a larger, pretty much everything's improved.

452
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Larger screen, so a 7.9 inch screen.

453
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,519
[SPEAKER_08]: It can do up to 4K.

454
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:12,639
[SPEAKER_08]: The

455
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,961
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

456
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:52,140
[SPEAKER_08]: and uh yeah 256 gigabytes of storage the system itself is basically the same uh size as the original switch obviously a little bit bigger but not thicker um on top of that and it will support uh switch one games although

457
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everything.

458
00:40:55,981 --> 00:41:00,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason for that is it's not actually playing it on the native hardware, it's emulating it.

459
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:09,565
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's already 120 Switch games that have compatibility issues that they're still working on getting fixed.

460
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is something to expect.

461
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But none of them are Nintendo first party games.

462
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them.

463
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:17,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

464
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:20,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them are very like...

465
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:26,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Fortnite is one of them, but there's going to be a separate Fortnite Switch 2 client anyway.

466
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want the Fortnite Switch 1 client on your Switch 2, I question your logic.

467
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:36,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are several games in there where I'm just like, okay, it doesn't work, whatever.

468
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And the games you care about the most, Nintendo first-party games, are all going to be fine.

469
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:45,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a non-issue to me, except for things like Labo.

470
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:47,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I feel like if you're like, I'm...

471
00:41:48,286 --> 00:41:50,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm upset because Labo won't work on Switch 2.

472
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you're trying to break the system, dude.

473
00:41:53,109 --> 00:42:02,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the specs for this thing are different and Labo involves, you know, physical things that were for the size of those old Joy-Cons and that has changed.

474
00:42:02,454 --> 00:42:09,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, Labo could work for some of that because the original Joy-Cons are compatible with the system.

475
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:11,659
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use them for games.

476
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:14,320
[SPEAKER_08]: So, technically, some of that would work.

477
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,781
[SPEAKER_08]: The VR, no.

478
00:42:15,961 --> 00:42:17,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it would not.

479
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:17,542
But let's

480
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:25,631
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are buying a Switch 2 to play Labo, I need you to stop and think about your money.

481
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:26,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you should open a CD.

482
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:28,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what to tell you.

483
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:29,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, go ahead.

484
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:32,859
[SPEAKER_08]: The battery life for the Switch 2 isn't going to be better.

485
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:39,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It's estimated to run 2 to 6.5 hours on a single charge, depending on what games you're playing.

486
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:40,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's...

487
00:42:41,966 --> 00:42:42,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Something.

488
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:51,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on top of that, we do know that the Joysticks, of course, the Analog Sticks is always a concern with Drift.

489
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:56,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are supposed to be Hall Effect switches now, or sticks, so at least that should be

490
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:23,966
[SPEAKER_08]: uh the drift issues should be gone there and also they promise that the e-shop will be better well I mean it can only get better well I do getting worse would be a choice it could yes it should be getting better because that's a very low bar of the hit um but they they do promise that it will be better than what it is on top of that they also showed off uh there was a this uh

491
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:25,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is so...

492
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:41,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid.

493
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:42,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be.

494
00:43:42,427 --> 00:43:42,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

495
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:04,465
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

496
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: and the justification for that is... Oh, you did mention this briefly early on, Loki.

497
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:35,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You said that in Japan, they are getting a cheaper Nintendo Switch 2 because of the value of the yen, although maybe some of that is tariff-related too because, you know, Japan doesn't have those same tariffs.

498
00:44:35,692 --> 00:44:35,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

499
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:43,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is a highly restrictive Switch 2, meaning you can only run it with a Japanese online account.

500
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:48,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only log into the Japanese eShop.

501
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:51,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only select Japanese as your language in games.

502
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:59,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are walling that system off as much as they can so that it is completely unattractive for somebody in the U.S.

503
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,180
[SPEAKER_05]: to go over there, buy one,

504
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:10,103
[SPEAKER_05]: and bring it back hidden in their suitcase so nobody tries to charge them for a tariff or just opening it and saying it's a used thing now and you can't tariff that.

505
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:14,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo is one of that.

506
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:21,207
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's like you said for now because this is the other consequence that we didn't get into and it's only a three-hour show.

507
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:22,447
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already 45 minutes in.

508
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:29,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the other consequence of these rising prices and things and that is that this is a challenge to piracy and hackers.

509
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,912
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a challenge to piracy and hackers to pirate Mario Kart.

510
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I think piracy is a bad idea.

511
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:02,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not advocate for it.

512
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:03,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I accept the reality.

513
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a consequence of what is going to happen in this situation.

514
00:46:07,274 --> 00:46:16,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do understand we had some chat with it in our VOG Network Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord, and 13xforever, who always has some insightful chat.

515
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate their ability to push back on some things that I put out there sometimes.

516
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't do this show live if I didn't enjoy getting...

517
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,710
[SPEAKER_05]: and the diverse opinions and things that even correct course me when I need to be corrected.

518
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

519
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:39,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of pushed back and said that there are a lot of security measures, not just on the OLED switch, but expected to be on the switch to to make that harder.

520
00:46:41,336 --> 00:46:50,720
[SPEAKER_05]: And but I also say I kind of push back on that and say every time, every time a company has said it's not possible, what happens?

521
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:58,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think it's a matter of time before that firmware, and that's the thing that I think is going to be the goal.

522
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:06,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that firmware on the Japanese Switch 2 out of there to accept the multi-language firmware.

523
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:10,105
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll probably be something hardwired on the console itself.

524
00:47:11,446 --> 00:47:14,829
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be people taking soldering irons to the situation to try to figure it out.

525
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:29,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't live in that world, so sure, maybe I'm just making it sound like a let's turn up the graphics on level 3 type of situation, but I fully expect the hacking and cracking community to be trying to open those Japanese Switch 2s.

526
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,046
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a question of how successful can they be.

527
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:32,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

528
00:47:32,886 --> 00:47:33,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

529
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:40,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and on top of that, you also have another motivation to do that as well as the loss of a lot of these physical game cards.

530
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:52,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So now a new thing that we're seeing with the Switch 2 editions releases are, aside from the Switch 1 cartridges with the one-use upgrade vouchers,

531
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:57,654
[SPEAKER_08]: for the Switch 2 edition, which that sucks right there.

532
00:47:57,894 --> 00:48:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So once again, if you buy a Switch 2 edition of a game, you can't resell that necessarily because it will just be the Switch 1 game.

533
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:17,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they also have game key cards, which are essentially, it's a plastic cartridge that you have that you buy and then you plug it into your system and then it downloads the game.

534
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:32,180
[SPEAKER_08]: so there's no game on that cart which means that when the Nintendo online service for the Switch 2 eventually shuts down that thing is fucked unless it's on your hard drive already um

535
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:40,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sucks as well, but I guess it's better than just typing in numbers or something like that into the eShop.

536
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:46,915
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still don't like the idea of digital games masquerading as physical games.

537
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:48,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think this is...

538
00:48:48,977 --> 00:48:59,081
[SPEAKER_05]: as terrible as people are making it out to be, but I will accept the pushback on the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop is always going to have an expiration date and there will come a time when these no longer work.

539
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:05,183
[SPEAKER_05]: However, that being said, I would argue these games already exist in Microsoft and Sony's world.

540
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:08,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would argue Call of Duty and Modern Warfare are some of those games.

541
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:11,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the biggest sellers are essentially doing this exact same thing.

542
00:49:11,745 --> 00:49:15,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, 90 gigabyte day one patches.

543
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,707
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck do you think you're downloading?

544
00:49:17,427 --> 00:49:25,874
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were to put in a No Man's Sky PlayStation 4 disc into your PlayStation today, you're going to be downloading the entire fucking game.

545
00:49:25,914 --> 00:49:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, before y'all push back, I understand.

546
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:33,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I could still play a version of No Man's Sky off of the disc and so forth.

547
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:39,505
[SPEAKER_05]: But as more and more games are getting online, I still say Call of Duty and all that stuff.

548
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:41,106
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the exact same thing.

549
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all are kidding yourselves.

550
00:49:43,388 --> 00:50:02,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's... And at least I think this is certainly better than the code card that comes... This is the way, because at least I can give this cartridge to DarkSakura, and then DarkSakura can put it in their Switch too, assuming she ever gets one, and could actually download the same game and play it with all those same rights.

551
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:08,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could still do a physical trade even if it's not really the game data on there.

552
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:11,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a step below having the game on the cart.

553
00:50:11,658 --> 00:50:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not... But...

554
00:50:13,258 --> 00:50:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I still argue this is kind of already happening in the game industry.

555
00:50:18,199 --> 00:50:19,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Y'all are just turning a blind eye to it.

556
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but there's already limited space on the Switch 2 anyways.

557
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:31,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I know 256 gigabytes sounds like a lot, but it's not, especially when these games are going to be larger in size.

558
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:33,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

559
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:35,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like the idea of that stuff.

560
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:38,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll accept that.

561
00:50:43,053 --> 00:51:03,376
[SPEAKER_08]: uh what else so yeah lots of game announcements uh Mario Kart World obviously the big one um some features that are coming to the Switch that are brand new for the Switch I guess or Switch 2 game chat so it looks like Discord except it has a shitty uh video camera that you could use as well with really low frame rate

562
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:06,473
[SPEAKER_08]: graphics on the video calls.

563
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:12,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The Piranha Plant one that the Hori company is making is super fucking cute.

564
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:17,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would indicate that any camera ought to work, question mark.

565
00:51:17,982 --> 00:51:21,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Nintendo hasn't quite filled in the gaps there.

566
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:25,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I will check my Nintendo Today app throughout the week to see if they comment on it.

567
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm anticipating third-party USB-C cameras will work fine.

568
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have a game share like they had with the DS where you can be able to stream the game essentially to other DSs or other, in this case, Switch 2 consoles or Switch consoles.

569
00:51:45,874 --> 00:51:50,475
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can play without actually having the game in certain multiplayer games.

570
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:51,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was kind of cool.

571
00:51:52,996 --> 00:51:54,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's the thing.

572
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:57,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe this didn't come up because I was thinking about it with that $80 price tag.

573
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:02,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's a little bit unclear.

574
00:52:02,197 --> 00:52:04,099
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't going to work on every game, right?

575
00:52:04,179 --> 00:52:05,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It works on some games.

576
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So is Mario Kart World to be confirmed to be one of those games?

577
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:13,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my mind, if it's confirmed, if, if, if...

578
00:52:17,412 --> 00:52:35,182
[SPEAKER_05]: it helps to justify that $80 price tag a little bit and that's something Nintendo could have come out to help build the case for why they believe $80 is a susceptible price for the game but you only need one copy of this game to share and race with your friends would have been a huge thing to sell with um

579
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

580
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:52,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

581
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:25,154
[SPEAKER_05]: at this time so this is a value add for Nintendo is being able to beam the game and share with friends and it's something that we should say yes that is a great thing that adds great value to a console that we're all screaming is not worth the value

582
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:27,564
[SPEAKER_08]: What else?

583
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,485
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a new Pro Controller coming.

584
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:36,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They've, of course, confirmed that your Joy-Con 2s are going to be magnetic.

585
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:42,952
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because they have a magnet inside the system and the L2R2 buttons, I think those are called.

586
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:49,234
[SPEAKER_08]: are metal, so that's how it adheres to the system itself.

587
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:57,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with that, they talked about compatible Switch games that you basically can port over your library, which is nice.

588
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:06,901
[SPEAKER_08]: They showed off Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild and the upgrades for that, including what was it?

589
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:07,421
[SPEAKER_08]: The

590
00:54:10,155 --> 00:54:15,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Mobile phone app that allows you to use it like a camera, like a, what was it, smart glass?

591
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:18,646
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Nintendo Smart Glass now.

592
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:19,587
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so interesting.

593
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:23,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is adopting all these Microsoft things years after the fact.

594
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: The Smart Glass, there's one.

595
00:54:26,672 --> 00:54:27,833
[SPEAKER_05]: The other would be the Kinect.

596
00:54:28,554 --> 00:54:32,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those games in Mario Party Jamboree looked like the cheap Kinect games.

597
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:33,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

598
00:54:33,677 --> 00:54:34,858
[SPEAKER_08]: The iToy.

599
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:36,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the iToy.

600
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:39,202
[SPEAKER_05]: The Jamboree was the weakest part of that whole Direct.

601
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:42,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was not a value add.

602
00:54:42,664 --> 00:54:43,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think...

603
00:54:44,245 --> 00:54:46,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Nintendo is going to get away with it.

604
00:54:46,548 --> 00:54:48,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And that people are going to eat that up a little bit.

605
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what that price though.

606
00:54:50,232 --> 00:54:51,673
[SPEAKER_05]: $80 for Jamboree.

607
00:54:51,773 --> 00:54:56,078
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't have the Switch 1 version, $80 for Jamboree is going to be a tough pill to swallow.

608
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

609
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not enthused by what I saw with Jamboree.

610
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:01,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm...

611
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:04,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very skeptical that that would work well.

612
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know tech has gotten a lot better since PlayStation 2 days, but... Jeez, that camera does not look great.

613
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:13,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it does not look like a high-quality camera, and I just...

614
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Camera gameplay just hasn't worked, and I can't imagine that Nintendo's like, yeah, we got this.

615
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they do, I don't know.

616
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:31,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Discord integration on the TV, which is something I think would be neat to see PlayStation and Xbox adopt.

617
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:43,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know Discord is integrated into PlayStation, but you can't do the cameras and live and all that and picture and picture and that whole thing, which I feel like we were getting closer to on the PlayStation 4 with the Twitch streaming built-in thing that we had there, but...

618
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:48,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get too far away, but I think there's a lot of interesting things there.

619
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:54,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I think being able to bridge living rooms with different families competing against each other in games.

620
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for some people that's going to be a lot of fun.

621
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm one of those people.

622
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:00,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I...

623
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:16,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm one of those people that, let's be real, it's gonna, it's gonna, not me personally, but I just, I'm gonna hear about this and it's gonna make me laugh, that all the gay guys are gonna get together and play Mario Kart and are gonna be wearing just their underwear on these calls and that, that's just funny because it's Nintendo.

624
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:24,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that's, you know, but luckily we have parental controls features now that I'm not as worried about this stuff going the way of PictoChat, but like...

625
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Hacker's Gonna Hack Hacker's Gonna Hack

626
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:44,380
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

627
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Other fun announcements.

628
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So Kirby and the Forgotten Land is getting a Switch 2 edition as well.

629
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:52,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to add Starcross Worlds, which is like an expansion to it.

630
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:58,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Metroid Prime 4 Beyond is also going to have a Switch 2 edition as well.

631
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:04,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Also confirmed that the Joy-Con 2s can be used like a mouse.

632
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:07,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will have mouse controls as well.

633
00:57:07,227 --> 00:57:09,188
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of exciting.

634
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:12,009
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the best feature of the Switch 2.

635
00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:17,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And way too many people are sleeping on this and under-reporting this.

636
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:25,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot tell you how excited I am to play Metroid Prime 4 with this new innovative control scheme.

637
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:29,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Because literally what it is, it is the best part of playing with a controller.

638
00:57:29,976 --> 00:57:32,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is the best part of playing with keyboard and mouse.

639
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:33,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Put together.

640
00:57:33,858 --> 00:57:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: You take keyboard and mouse and you replace WASD with an actual control analog.

641
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:41,082
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to be amazing.

642
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:47,045
[SPEAKER_05]: If the mouse actually runs as well as a PC mouse does...

643
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:56,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume because these mice only cost like $10 at this point that that technology is going to be present in these and it will run pretty well.

644
00:57:57,756 --> 00:58:00,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm withholding my final judgment until I actually get to get in there and play the game.

645
00:58:00,918 --> 00:58:06,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think about how fucking great that's going to work on Metroid Prime 2 and how great that's going to work on...

646
00:58:08,582 --> 00:58:10,925
[SPEAKER_05]: E3VL says ergonomics is an issue Sure, you gotta be careful

647
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:24,699
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

648
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:48,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be possible.

649
00:58:49,054 --> 00:58:54,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I just replace the Joy-Con controller with a real mouse that sends the same Bluetooth signal?

650
00:58:55,415 --> 00:58:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the tits.

651
00:58:57,855 --> 00:58:58,716
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.

652
00:59:01,016 --> 00:59:01,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe.

653
00:59:01,596 --> 00:59:03,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Until we know, we don't.

654
00:59:04,677 --> 00:59:08,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Pokemon Legends ZA also getting a Switch 2 edition.

655
00:59:08,538 --> 00:59:10,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's no-brainer.

656
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:10,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.

657
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:40,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Drag, DragXDrive Bobby says a lot of the games that use the mouse also use the gyro so it's not a one-to-one to a real mouse I still wonder if for some of these port games, okay so maybe less your Mario, or maybe less your Metroid Prime 4, but your Overwatch ports let's say, I still wonder if that isn't something that couldn't be possible just like you can plug a keyboard in the Playstation 5 most games don't support it but there's a couple that do

658
00:59:41,849 --> 01:00:08,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Microsoft does that a lot too I would just be curious if it's possible, that's all Because I think, again, it could be a game changer Anyway DragX Drive, which was that wheelchair basketball game Using the double mouse controls Oh yeah, that was fucking cool That was a really cool concept And I think that's going to make a lot of people feel seen And that's really cool DarkSakura, did you see that game?

659
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:09,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah

660
01:00:10,964 --> 01:00:11,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

661
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:18,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So you take both Joy-Cons in their mouse mode, and it's a wheelchair basketball game.

662
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:21,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And you move them like this, like you're moving a wheelchair around.

663
01:00:22,595 --> 01:00:23,595
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't see it.

664
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:24,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you should.

665
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:25,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a neat trailer.

666
01:00:25,737 --> 01:00:30,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play a lot of sports games, but it was like...

667
01:00:31,022 --> 01:00:41,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't just the fact that it was wheelchair basketball, which we haven't really seen in gaming, but it had a Rocket League kind of vibe to it that made it really cool to me.

668
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:43,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

669
01:00:44,383 --> 01:00:52,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course, next big announcement, third-party game, Elden Ring coming to the Switch 2, so Elden Ring Tarnished Edition.

670
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:56,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Also got confirmation that Hades 2 is coming to the Switch 2.

671
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:06,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of third-party games, Street Fighter 6, getting a Years 1-2 Fighters Edition, which is including 26 characters.

672
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:12,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Daemon X Machina, Titanic Scion is coming to the Switch 2.

673
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:31,590
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as Split Fiction 2 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 I want to say also Hitman World of Satiation Project 007 Borderlands 4 Bravely Default getting a remaster Yakuza I'm into that actually

674
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:52,450
[SPEAKER_05]: New Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment That was actually really cool I'm glad Hyrule Warriors is coming back again I'm excited to play that All the third party support, cool It needed that We knew there was going to be a lot of catch up games that come out Cool, I'm glad Switch 2 is being supported It needs it, cool

675
01:01:53,251 --> 01:02:11,488
[SPEAKER_08]: and then they announced that because of the more powerful hardware that it will be able to offer Nintendo GameCube emulation as part of Nintendo Classics through Nintendo Online Expansion Pass which includes the starter games Wind Waker, Soul Calibur 2 and F-Zero GX.

676
01:02:12,088 --> 01:02:14,249
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also a GameCube controller.

677
01:02:14,389 --> 01:02:20,171
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a part of me that's like only three games, but then I'm also like they picked a killer lineup of three.

678
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:25,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you could only pick three GameCube games to launch your service with, they picked a really soft three.

679
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:27,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Like obviously I am super psyched about F-Zero.

680
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:30,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard this on Bobby's show.

681
01:02:30,575 --> 01:02:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently he was watching the Treehouse streams and they confirmed that the widescreen modes will work.

682
01:02:36,297 --> 01:02:37,378
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

683
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:00,628
[SPEAKER_05]: How about that?

684
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:03,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Chad is saying Super Mario Strikers is confirmed for the lineup, too.

685
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:05,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So that must have been a Treehouse announcement or something.

686
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:10,932
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a bunch of other game titles that they showed, like, after they showed those three games off.

687
01:03:11,253 --> 01:03:14,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I remember there was, of course, Mario Sunshine.

688
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:15,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The drip feed.

689
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Please look forward to the drip feeding for the next two years.

690
01:03:18,535 --> 01:03:18,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

691
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:21,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Pokemon Stadium, all that stuff.

692
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:23,618
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, it looks pretty cool.

693
01:03:25,614 --> 01:03:33,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget, this is very important when it comes to that.

694
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:36,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We're saying, yay, F-Zero, yay, Soul Calibur.

695
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:44,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to remember, some time ago, Nintendo allowed their emulators to be played across the internet.

696
01:03:45,632 --> 01:03:46,332
[SPEAKER_05]: F-Zero F-Zero F-Zero

697
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:10,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't know if the GameCube client will let you do four people online.

698
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Nintendo Treehouse confirmed that or not.

699
01:04:14,543 --> 01:04:17,527
[SPEAKER_05]: But think about that for a minute.

700
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:21,571
[SPEAKER_05]: That we're going to be able to play four player across... Okay, Treehouse showed it.

701
01:04:21,832 --> 01:04:24,214
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be able to play four player across the internet in F-Zero.

702
01:04:24,975 --> 01:04:44,729
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's that's something yeah so yes we're getting excited about 20 year old games but we're going to be able to play them in a way we weren't able to play them 20 years ago that's that's huge that's that's a twitch stream that's a VOG Network twitch stream now Bobby Blackwolf and the cast of OLR beat each other up in F-Zero GX could be a thing

703
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:47,737
[SPEAKER_08]: what else?

704
01:04:48,237 --> 01:05:15,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Deltarune chapters 1-4 also Civ 7 of course using the mouse support that they have with the Joy-Con 2 Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition coming as well Final Fantasy 7 Remake Integrate and a bunch of other games that they showed off as well one of the ones I was very excited about was

705
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:22,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, so Enter the Gungeon 2 looked amazing, so that's going to be cool.

706
01:05:22,554 --> 01:05:36,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they also get a brand new exclusive FromSoftware game called The Duskbloods, which looks like a Vampire Souls-like game, and that's launching next year as well.

707
01:05:37,569 --> 01:06:01,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirby Air Riders brand new Kirby game coming as well as a follow up to Kirby Air Ride and then of course the last game that they finished it off with looks like a Mario Odyssey game but Donkey Kong Bonanza and it's kind of like the Donkey Kong Odyssey but not but along those lines and that is coming out July 17th for only $70

708
01:06:04,518 --> 01:06:19,677
[SPEAKER_05]: chat feels you buried the lead on Kirby Air Riders look, look, we're an hour plus into the show we have to cut a few corners we'll address those games in greater detail when we get our hands on them at some point

709
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,039
[SPEAKER_05]: But that leads me to this question.

710
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:24,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have more, Loki, at some point?

711
01:06:25,562 --> 01:06:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, real quick.

712
01:06:26,563 --> 01:06:27,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-orders.

713
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:33,669
[SPEAKER_08]: So originally with pre-orders, obviously you can pre-order through retailers and stuff.

714
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo also is taking pre-orders.

715
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there are some caveats there.

716
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:46,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are allowing you to place a pre-order or interest in a pre-order if you have a Nintendo Online membership.

717
01:06:47,321 --> 01:07:02,942
[SPEAKER_08]: You must have had paid for a minimum of 12 months for that membership and have at least shared your gameplay stats as well as 50 hours of total gameplay.

718
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:07,505
[SPEAKER_08]: on that account, basically to try to combat scalpers.

719
01:07:08,165 --> 01:07:10,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Which they have to do.

720
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:14,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about the restricting it to the paid online only.

721
01:07:14,547 --> 01:07:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a little crappy, but it's all right.

722
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:21,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand why they have to do it.

723
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:25,192
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to draw the line somewhere and they want to make sure the real gamers get it.

724
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:26,652
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't.

725
01:07:28,153 --> 01:07:29,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a hill I want to die on.

726
01:07:29,574 --> 01:07:30,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.

727
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:39,918
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Mike Deft in chat says, at least mention Sakurai is returning to work on a Kirby game since for like two decades.

728
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and never ask him for anything ever again.

729
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see?

730
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:46,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see?

731
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:55,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the YouTubers are already going crazy on like some fucking leak on Super Smash Brothers, which, you know, I'm not.

732
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,527
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going crazy.

733
01:07:57,727 --> 01:07:58,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

734
01:07:58,388 --> 01:07:58,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

735
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:03,694
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's reasonable to expect, like it feels like one of those things is just safe.

736
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:12,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Betting that a Super Smash Brothers will come out on the Switch too, I just feel like it's one of those things where it's like, that's just a safe thing to try to make yourself look like a genius.

737
01:08:12,363 --> 01:08:13,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I called it!

738
01:08:14,985 --> 01:08:15,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

739
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:16,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

740
01:08:16,807 --> 01:08:18,508
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gonna be a Mario game.

741
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,649
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll probably be a Splatoon 4.

742
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,291
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit, Sherlock.

743
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:23,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry.

744
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:23,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

745
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:53,967
[SPEAKER_08]: no I think that's about it for Switch 2 stuff I mean honestly it's been a lot we still have a lot to find out like with what's going on with pre-orders if they're going to open those back up I mean at the end of the day and I hate to say that I'm part of the problem I still probably will order one but with that caveat though like the only difference the only difference though with that is with the Switch right now like I've been picking up a lot of the first party games as they come out like pretty much as they come out

746
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:58,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that would be the case with the Switch 2 because of the additional cost for everything.

747
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,911
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, it's obviously something we're going to play.

748
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're going to get our money's worth out of it.

749
01:09:06,232 --> 01:09:13,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, yeah, I don't... I still don't like the idea of it basically giving the okay to...

750
01:09:14,758 --> 01:09:15,799
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of the game industry.

751
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:22,562
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a different situation if the other game companies in the gaming industry had the same quality as Nintendo.

752
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:24,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We would be having a whole different conversation here.

753
01:09:25,003 --> 01:09:27,544
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, that's just not the landscape that we live in.

754
01:09:28,384 --> 01:09:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that these other companies treat their consumers and treat their employees, I don't feel that they are worth $80 a game.

755
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:43,452
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not shown us that they are responsible enough to release games in a finished state that is...

756
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:48,757
[SPEAKER_08]: is worth $80 at the outset.

757
01:09:49,257 --> 01:09:56,745
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have not shown us that we can trust them to even just follow through with their promises in these games in the first place.

758
01:09:57,405 --> 01:10:03,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just honestly think that it's a huge mistake to just give them that pass.

759
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, where's your head at with Switch 2 and all this?

760
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:17,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember last week, I felt like you were a little tepid because you were kind of like, we don't really play our Switch a lot a lot.

761
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:20,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm curious where your head's at on Switch 2 right now.

762
01:10:21,758 --> 01:10:24,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still about the same as I was last week.

763
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:28,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I want to wait and see how things play out.

764
01:10:29,621 --> 01:10:29,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

765
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:57,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I watched some reviews one of my favorite tech reviewers, Mr. Who's the Boss did a video, I actually posted it on my Blue Sky a couple days ago comparing the OLED switch to the LCD on the Switch 2 in that it was brighter and more vibrant talking about how it felt in the hand, about the

766
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:05,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Way that the Joy-Con snap on and almost lock in place how firm they are.

767
01:11:06,857 --> 01:11:11,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in construction, it definitely sounds like it's a far better product.

768
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm interested in that respect.

769
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:19,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would love to have like a new Animal Crossing.

770
01:11:19,227 --> 01:11:21,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly a new Animal Crossing would sell a system for me.

771
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:33,014
[SPEAKER_03]: but right now there's not enough going on on it that I would want to rush right out and get one it's not wait in line worthy for me at this point

772
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:44,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's that's fair, especially because, you know, when we saw the titles coming out for it, we really only saw stuff, you know, at least first party for just a few months out.

773
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:49,703
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no there was no holiday announcement from Nintendo, which I found a little bit like Pokemon.

774
01:11:49,883 --> 01:11:52,084
[SPEAKER_08]: We still don't know Pokemon and all that stuff's coming out.

775
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:54,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but I don't care about Pokemon.

776
01:11:55,026 --> 01:12:05,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care about Mario Kart because I don't really find it fun I certainly don't care about Donkey Kong games because I haven't thought any of them were particularly fun um

777
01:12:06,445 --> 01:12:08,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Kirby's great, you know?

778
01:12:08,606 --> 01:12:09,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Kirby.

779
01:12:09,546 --> 01:12:11,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't bought the last couple ones.

780
01:12:13,268 --> 01:12:27,094
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just nothing really that super interests me about it other than that it seems like it would be a much brighter and sturdier and certainly larger screen to play my old shit on.

781
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:35,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess my point in bringing that up was that I still feel like, you know, with E3 not being a thing anymore, we still have the Summer Game Fest.

782
01:12:35,913 --> 01:12:42,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I guess whatever the ESA is, apparently, you know, the other time that we've kind of gone, wow, that might be an interesting thing they're doing.

783
01:12:42,997 --> 01:12:51,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I already forgot the name of the show, but the not E3 thing that they're going to be doing in the summer at some point, that's E3 without the show floor, basically.

784
01:12:51,762 --> 01:12:52,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

785
01:12:53,203 --> 01:13:19,487
[SPEAKER_05]: that uh maybe Nintendo will announce another flagship title that could be oh Iacon is coming in 2026 my bad I thought it was this year okay oh I know it's not gonna have dead by daylight but uh it could you know maybe they're having problems with I was I was gonna say maybe that Animal Crossing or that game you really want is holiday maybe yeah but I know they're not gonna have a dead by daylight on it because of some programming issues interesting

786
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:23,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's at least what I've been hearing so far.

787
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:27,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it could happen, but I play on my Mac anyway, so what's the point?

788
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:35,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just... This really... You know me.

789
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,592
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, I own how many systems?

790
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:45,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't need to have any more right now?

791
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:48,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know I didn't buy my Switch, right?

792
01:13:49,588 --> 01:13:52,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you won it in a work raffle or something, right?

793
01:13:52,133 --> 01:13:53,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I won my Switch.

794
01:13:53,415 --> 01:13:56,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really have any much of an intention of buying one at the time.

795
01:13:56,541 --> 01:14:00,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of in the same boat, so maybe I'll win another one.

796
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:00,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

797
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:01,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll have one.

798
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:02,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

799
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:05,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for me, I'm just not excited.

800
01:14:05,798 --> 01:14:08,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm actually kind of there with Loki.

801
01:14:08,339 --> 01:14:11,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I, maybe I'm part of the problem, but yeah, I want to pre-order one.

802
01:14:12,121 --> 01:14:17,883
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if the tariff thing is resolved, which again, and also we have to see what the price is too.

803
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:20,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause after tariffs, if it's like $600, that's right.

804
01:14:22,465 --> 01:14:27,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I, I'm not paying who is in line for, were any of us in line for PS fives?

805
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:30,968
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I did get a series X on launch day.

806
01:14:32,418 --> 01:15:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: and I probably would have gotten a PS5 on launch day if I could have but I ended up waiting two years for a PS5 and it worked out okay you know and that might end up being the case with Switch 2 especially since we know that the Switch 1 still has a lot of games coming out for it but I just I yeah I'm into the technology especially when I think about 4 player F-Zero and GameCube when I think about how much better Pokemon Legends ZA is going to run on it how much I want to play Metroid Prime 4 with those controls but

807
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:02,314
[SPEAKER_05]: to that extent.

808
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:05,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will not pay more than $450 or $500.

809
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:13,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say $500 because obviously I'm going to get that bundle with Mario Kart that makes the price a lot more digestible.

810
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:16,862
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will not pay more than $500 for it.

811
01:15:17,202 --> 01:15:19,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So if tariffs fuck the whole situation, I will just wait.

812
01:15:20,324 --> 01:15:20,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait.

813
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm definitely not going to the used market for it.

814
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck all of them.

815
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm definitely not doing that.

816
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:30,389
[SPEAKER_03]: What might sell one for us would be maybe a Smash.

817
01:15:31,325 --> 01:15:32,286
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

818
01:15:45,640 --> 01:16:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: but where I will also agree with Loki that I will give and this is across the board this is not just Nintendo I'm going to give a lot more consideration to where I'm dropping my money for games I'm not going to buy games on a fucking whim I'm going to buy games when I know I have the time to sit down and play them and that I want to dedicate the time to put it put into them

819
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:11,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be my thing moving forward.

820
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:14,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to spend $80 on a game.

821
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:24,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, for that Donkey Kong game, as neat as that whole thing looks and stuff, I'm not pre-ordering that and I'm not paying $70 the day it comes out until I hear it is so good.

822
01:16:24,688 --> 01:16:29,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm missing something and I have the time in my life to sit down and play that game.

823
01:16:30,908 --> 01:16:42,135
[SPEAKER_05]: and even then I will probably still leverage bargaining like Costco, Nintendo gift cards assuming that's still a thing or whatever I can leverage to try to make that price a little more digestible.

824
01:16:43,676 --> 01:16:45,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my other thing.

825
01:16:45,957 --> 01:16:50,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably get a Steam Deck before I get a Switch 2.

826
01:16:51,547 --> 01:16:51,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

827
01:16:52,247 --> 01:16:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my Steam Deck.

828
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:53,948
[SPEAKER_05]: My Steam Deck's great.

829
01:16:53,988 --> 01:16:54,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the library.

830
01:16:55,128 --> 01:16:55,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

831
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:59,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, though, I don't really bring portable systems with me anymore.

832
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I just usually have my iPad if I travel.

833
01:17:06,593 --> 01:17:10,374
[SPEAKER_05]: My Switch 2 will always be docked because that's how I am with my Switch 1.

834
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: The only time I take my Switch 1 out of the dock is when I'm going on an airplane.

835
01:17:15,276 --> 01:17:15,596
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

836
01:17:16,605 --> 01:17:19,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't take my Switch with me when I travel.

837
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I just bring my iPad and typically I read books.

838
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:30,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm usually going to a gaming con or a con with gamers where I feel I'll be able to get use out of it.

839
01:17:30,514 --> 01:17:30,914
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

840
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:34,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I still read books.

841
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't brought one to TwitchCon anytime I've been to TwitchCon.

842
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I might bring the Game Boy Micro just for lols.

843
01:17:46,272 --> 01:17:51,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Def says you could use the Steam Deck to stream games via a capture card.

844
01:17:51,677 --> 01:17:52,958
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a clever use for it.

845
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm oddly landing in the same boat as Loki, where it's like, yeah, I'll pre-order one, but I'm going to give a lot more thought to how I'm spending my money on games.

846
01:18:04,029 --> 01:18:05,450
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot more thought to that.

847
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo's habit of never putting games on sale...

848
01:18:11,491 --> 01:18:14,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's going to fly anymore in the year 2025, but we'll see.

849
01:18:15,292 --> 01:18:15,612
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

850
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not ordering shit.

851
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, fuck pre-orders.

852
01:18:23,275 --> 01:18:25,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not putting my name down for anything.

853
01:18:26,096 --> 01:18:27,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not putting my money down for anything.

854
01:18:27,796 --> 01:18:29,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for the system itself.

855
01:18:29,517 --> 01:18:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not even for the system.

856
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:32,338
[SPEAKER_05]: No, for me, I will.

857
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

858
01:18:34,078 --> 01:18:35,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I have zero need to do that.

859
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:38,300
[SPEAKER_05]: You are welcome to your opinion, but I will get one to get the system.

860
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:38,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the point.

861
01:18:39,713 --> 01:19:08,819
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the point the reason why is because I want to send the message that there's not interest because of the price points they're setting for everything if you're like oh I don't like this price point for this or I'm not going to support that and you're still putting your name down for one that's still sending them the message that what they're doing is okay I sort of always expected this thing to be $500 and that's where I'm at

862
01:19:10,464 --> 01:19:14,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But I won't pay more than that because of stupid-ass tariffs and rules and things like that.

863
01:19:16,507 --> 01:19:16,807
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

864
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:20,750
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked a lot about the Switch, but we knew we would.

865
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew it was that kind of night, and this is the thing that everybody's talking about tonight.

866
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcome your feedback as well.

867
01:19:26,893 --> 01:19:33,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcome your thoughts, whether it's as simple as what DeboPop12 says in chat, Nintendo Switch 2 for the win, or...

868
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Coffey, who says the console price for the Switch 2 is reasonable.

869
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:39,280
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the game prices that are WTF.

870
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Def saying the price of the console ain't the problem.

871
01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:48,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwell says the game key cards are just the digital key, like a UB key or other hardware authentication device.

872
01:19:49,325 --> 01:19:52,266
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get your comments, not just through chat, but also email.

873
01:19:52,306 --> 01:19:54,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great topic to send us if you have more in-depth thoughts.

874
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:58,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Participate at OrangeLodgeRadio.com if you want to send us an email with your in-depth thoughts.

875
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:02,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, we also welcome the bleats over on BlueSky.com.

876
01:20:03,312 --> 01:20:05,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on BlueSky is domain-based.

877
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:09,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It's OrangeLoungeRadio.com on BlueSky if you want to send us some bleats over there.

878
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:14,598
[SPEAKER_05]: For the meantime, believe it or not, we have other gaming things to talk about.

879
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:17,840
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to start, as usual, by talking about our gaming weeks.

880
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, let's start with you.

881
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:20,161
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

882
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:24,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the usual stuff.

883
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:33,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I started Mass Effect last night for my semi-retro night now because I really wanted to play Mass Effect.

884
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:46,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had the overwhelming sense of nostalgia and thanks to my chat, my shepherd is named Meg because of me being a dirty Megmane.

885
01:20:48,335 --> 01:20:50,076
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you didn't have to name her Pigu.

886
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:53,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would have named her Amanda.

887
01:20:54,376 --> 01:20:54,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair.

888
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:57,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

889
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, me talking shit about the characters the whole time because I'm allowed to.

890
01:21:03,786 --> 01:21:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course I played... I didn't play any Monster Hunter.

891
01:21:07,269 --> 01:21:08,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a break from it.

892
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit too much for my head.

893
01:21:10,653 --> 01:21:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But I played some Dead by Daylight and we had...

894
01:21:13,755 --> 01:21:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: 5 ghoul games in a row and I'm just like, you know what?

895
01:21:16,676 --> 01:21:17,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

896
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:17,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to play.

897
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:27,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did play Rize for my games and it's definitely different after me playing almost exclusively Pig for a while.

898
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:30,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It was different.

899
01:21:32,082 --> 01:21:33,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, still playing Fruit Mountain.

900
01:21:33,882 --> 01:21:37,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing my stupid little Mahjong game.

901
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:40,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Bellatro.

902
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:41,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Bellatro.

903
01:21:43,115 --> 01:21:44,096
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm not doing anything.

904
01:21:45,677 --> 01:21:49,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sort of like my stupid clicky game at this point.

905
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really addicted to it.

906
01:21:50,499 --> 01:21:53,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same reason I play Mahjong.

907
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:57,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some Palia.

908
01:21:58,264 --> 01:22:00,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've got my second property in Palia now.

909
01:22:01,866 --> 01:22:03,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've made it just for touring.

910
01:22:03,387 --> 01:22:07,109
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of like this magical witch in the woods theme.

911
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:14,222
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I think my second theme I'm going to do is all when I do my next property is going to be like all railroads.

912
01:22:15,283 --> 01:22:17,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

913
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:23,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing something else and my brain kind of farted on what it was.

914
01:22:23,627 --> 01:22:25,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was it.

915
01:22:25,147 --> 01:22:26,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Spun back to Mass Effect.

916
01:22:26,968 --> 01:22:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Garrus, I want to date you now.

917
01:22:32,471 --> 01:22:32,811
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

918
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:35,092
[SPEAKER_03]: He showed up and my response was soon.

919
01:22:37,013 --> 01:22:37,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your gaming week.

920
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:41,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's see, uh, it was Minecraft.

921
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:47,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I played lots of Minecraft and then I put out another episode five weeks in a row now, so that's great.

922
01:22:49,907 --> 01:22:53,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, and I also went and saw the Minecraft movie twice.

923
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:54,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's talk about that.

924
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:59,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us, tell us how you felt about the Minecraft movie as somebody who consumes a lot of Minecraft.

925
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:02,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I really liked it.

926
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:06,796
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not... I don't even think you necessarily have to consume a lot of Minecraft.

927
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:15,043
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people were like easy to judge or like early to judge it based off of like, oh, well, I don't play Minecraft, so I don't understand any of this and stuff.

928
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:21,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, honestly, it's more... Apparently, there's plenty not in that boat because it did bang in business this weekend.

929
01:23:21,048 --> 01:23:26,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you saw, but it made more money than the Mario Brothers movie did, which, you know, could be inflation.

930
01:23:26,313 --> 01:23:27,594
[SPEAKER_05]: But it did well.

931
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:27,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That's...

932
01:23:29,563 --> 01:23:30,784
[SPEAKER_05]: The Minecraft movie has done very well.

933
01:23:30,824 --> 01:23:33,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It did better than Captain America.

934
01:23:37,649 --> 01:23:38,790
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the biggest weekend this year.

935
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:46,236
[SPEAKER_08]: As I say, it's got a lot of absurd humor like Jared Hess's other movies, like Napoleon Dynamite especially.

936
01:23:46,736 --> 01:23:57,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Even before we even get into the Minecraft world, there's just a lot of absurd characters that they kind of introduce and you know, just like

937
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:12,491
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the funny bits in the beginning, so two of the kids are moving into this brand new town after their mom passed away or something like that, and so he goes to a brand new school, and the vice principal's like, yeah, I like to overshare.

938
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:18,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It just completely starts talking about her divorce and all this stuff, just all this stuff overshared.

939
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:22,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you see the next scene, he goes to his class, and his teacher's like,

940
01:24:22,574 --> 01:24:47,066
[SPEAKER_08]: just oversharing again like I you know I claimed four thousand dollars on my tax returns you know just like ridiculous stuff like the whole thing was full of ridiculous characters and a bunch of ridiculous scenes in there as well I thought it was it was funny it would like a weird dry sense of humor I guess I like that kind of stuff um certainly like if you're going into it expecting like

941
01:24:48,618 --> 01:24:55,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft Story Mode or something like that, where it's a story in Minecraft, you know, around Minecraft mechanics and stuff like that.

942
01:24:56,232 --> 01:24:57,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Minecraft has a plot?

943
01:24:57,454 --> 01:24:57,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

944
01:24:58,544 --> 01:25:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's, it's, it's not, like, but it's, it was funny.

945
01:25:04,026 --> 01:25:04,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know.

946
01:25:05,127 --> 01:25:08,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed it enough to go see it twice, and I thought it was really funny both times.

947
01:25:09,329 --> 01:25:11,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody in the theater had a good time, too.

948
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:19,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of, like, I know that some of the complaints I've seen, too, is like, well, they're just shouting out, you know, the lines that they saw in the trailer and stuff like that.

949
01:25:20,126 --> 01:25:23,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like some people do will go in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and stuff like that.

950
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:24,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, hold up.

951
01:25:25,068 --> 01:25:25,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold up.

952
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocky Horror Picture Show is a unique experience that people expect to see.

953
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:32,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know.

954
01:25:34,012 --> 01:25:35,873
[SPEAKER_05]: The talking back to the movie, I don't know.

955
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:41,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's multiple ways because I don't think I'm interested in seeing the Minecraft movie with kids yelling back at it.

956
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean I won't see it.

957
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:47,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm actually pleased to hear it's doing well because that means it'll stay in theaters for a month.

958
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:48,598
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

959
01:26:12,037 --> 01:26:18,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw it at the Dollar Theater with a full because it was the very first weekend that it showed up at the Dollar Theater.

960
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:24,904
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a very full house with a very diverse crowd that loved to talk through the movie.

961
01:26:25,604 --> 01:26:28,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will say I had a really fucking good time.

962
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:30,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I fucking loved it.

963
01:26:31,297 --> 01:26:40,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you haven't lived until you've seen The Matrix with that opening scene where she's like doing the crane kick and somebody's like yelling out, fuck yeah, get him, girl!

964
01:26:40,202 --> 01:26:41,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, things like that.

965
01:26:41,123 --> 01:26:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I loved it.

966
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a great time.

967
01:26:43,925 --> 01:26:44,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

968
01:26:44,805 --> 01:26:46,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm a little torn, but yeah.

969
01:26:49,676 --> 01:26:50,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

970
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:52,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had a good time.

971
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it was worth it, I think.

972
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, it's, like, the best acting.

973
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:04,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It's certainly not to the level of, like, a Lego movie or something like that, where, like, there's a, you know, big story.

974
01:27:04,644 --> 01:27:17,270
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, honestly, there's a lot of it to identify with, in a sense, because one of... Not to get too spoilery, but, like, essentially, they show Steve in the beginning, and he's, like, from the real world.

975
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:18,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And he...

976
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:27,436
[SPEAKER_08]: He's basically this guy that's stuck in an office job and just unhappy with not being able to be creative in that office job.

977
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:33,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, they're seeking creativity and, like, an outlet for that outside of... I don't know anyone that feels that way.

978
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:39,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yes, outside of the doldrum of your office corporate life existence and stuff like that.

979
01:27:39,183 --> 01:27:42,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, yes, that's completely identifiable.

980
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:45,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I completely relate with that.

981
01:27:46,188 --> 01:27:46,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

982
01:27:47,328 --> 01:28:15,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's a lot of that stuff like you know even with Jason Momoa's character kind of trying to you know live off the glory of your past or something like that and just trying to adapt with the fact that like you know hey you gotta move on you know that type of thing or just be better or whatever the case may be so everybody's kind of had like their own like growth in the in the story um

983
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:22,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's funny, because even parts where Jack Black's character is not really likable in certain parts.

984
01:28:23,305 --> 01:28:27,387
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing that's funny, though, is there's a lot of physical humor in it as well.

985
01:28:27,407 --> 01:28:32,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like people just getting completely destroyed in fights and stuff like that.

986
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,771
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's funny, because it's stupid.

987
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:39,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the long, drawn-out gags that they have are really...

988
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:40,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Hilarious.

989
01:28:40,803 --> 01:28:41,824
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, I think.

990
01:28:41,944 --> 01:28:42,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

991
01:28:42,344 --> 01:28:48,286
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, I'm a guy that like, you know, I went and saw Kung Pao in the theaters like eight times.

992
01:28:48,326 --> 01:28:49,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't even know.

993
01:28:49,146 --> 01:28:51,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's like, I like dumb movies.

994
01:28:51,286 --> 01:28:52,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Jennifer Coolidge is in it.

995
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:54,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Jennifer Coolidge is in it.

996
01:28:55,368 --> 01:28:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: And she is the vice principal who over shares everything.

997
01:28:59,549 --> 01:29:00,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is ridiculous.

998
01:29:00,809 --> 01:29:01,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I love her so much.

999
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:02,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

1000
01:29:04,352 --> 01:29:08,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to see it so I have more impressions to put in my catalog

1001
01:29:14,028 --> 01:29:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1002
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:21,893
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like... She's like hitting on the Garbage Man, which is Jason Momoa's character.

1003
01:29:22,373 --> 01:29:26,015
[SPEAKER_08]: He's Garrett the Garbage Man Garrison or something like that.

1004
01:29:27,636 --> 01:29:28,937
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how ridiculous his character is.

1005
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:31,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's like great at this arcade beat-em-up game.

1006
01:29:31,778 --> 01:29:33,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Final Fight or something like that.

1007
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:38,022
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he would be... It's a two-player co-op game.

1008
01:29:38,402 --> 01:29:39,603
[SPEAKER_08]: He was playing both sides.

1009
01:29:39,723 --> 01:29:39,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1010
01:29:40,323 --> 01:30:08,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I also heard this involves a mention of an Atari Cosmos Yes, there's an Atari Cosmos that's he's trying to win because he owns a retro game store and they're evicting him because he needs to pay his rent and so he was bidding on storage basically like storage units and one that had an Atari Cosmos in it but obviously something happens

1011
01:30:10,302 --> 01:30:15,182
[SPEAKER_08]: But like that, or like, you know, eventually when they find the, you know...

1012
01:30:16,021 --> 01:30:19,184
[SPEAKER_08]: The device to get to the Minecraft world or whatever.

1013
01:30:19,484 --> 01:30:24,268
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes with a warning that's super specific for Jason Momoa's character.

1014
01:30:24,588 --> 01:30:27,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So whatever you do, don't put this thing inside this thing.

1015
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:28,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the other side.

1016
01:30:29,112 --> 01:30:39,300
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're a struggling small business owner who's really hard on finances right now, I just want to let you know that there's tons of riches here.

1017
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that you should come here anyways, but...

1018
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:45,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Just letting you know that there's tons of riches here as well.

1019
01:30:45,823 --> 01:30:48,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so oddly specific that it makes it even funnier.

1020
01:30:51,905 --> 01:31:01,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember who it was I've seen when they're talking about writing comedy jokes, but essentially to make the joke like, oh no, I hit somebody with my car again.

1021
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:25,200
[SPEAKER_08]: could be funny but saying like oh no I hit somebody with my Jeep Grand Cherokee again that's funnier um and that's kind of that premise that they took with this movie as well they get very oddly specific with some of the gags and it's just up my alley to be honest it it's it's it's silly it it's silly and I love it and it's ridiculous and you just have to kind of

1022
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not realistic.

1023
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:32,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a silly movie that's like a Napoleon Dynamite or Nacho Libre.

1024
01:31:33,033 --> 01:31:33,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1025
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:36,276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open to seeing it at some point.

1026
01:31:36,797 --> 01:31:38,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just I never get to the movies.

1027
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I was supposed to see that Looney Tunes movie.

1028
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:40,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Never did.

1029
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, things happen.

1030
01:31:43,183 --> 01:31:47,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the Tiger Claw mentioned there's one joke in the movie involving Jason Momoa and Jack Black.

1031
01:31:48,683 --> 01:31:52,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, all I'm going to say is full man sandwich.

1032
01:31:53,344 --> 01:31:53,984
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.

1033
01:31:55,185 --> 01:32:00,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the absolute just like most ridiculous thing and it's great.

1034
01:32:01,926 --> 01:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Full man sandwich.

1035
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:03,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1036
01:32:04,787 --> 01:32:09,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it sounds like a good review for the Minecraft movie from Loki, so great.

1037
01:32:09,928 --> 01:32:12,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week you want to share, Loki?

1038
01:32:14,569 --> 01:32:16,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a little bit of Blotro, but that's about it.

1039
01:32:17,661 --> 01:32:20,463
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was very retro of sorts.

1040
01:32:21,304 --> 01:32:33,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gaming at a friend's house and we were playing old games like I played the original Mario Kart, we played Mario Kart 8, we played Luminous, we played some fighting games like Mortal Kombat Armageddon, of all things, like very random.

1041
01:32:33,932 --> 01:32:35,473
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is so clunky now to me.

1042
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:37,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not age well, I will see that.

1043
01:32:38,594 --> 01:32:39,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I was doing some retro stuff.

1044
01:32:39,815 --> 01:32:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was playing retro.

1045
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:42,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Castlevania.

1046
01:32:43,435 --> 01:32:43,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

1047
01:32:43,795 --> 01:32:45,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in a weird retro mood lately.

1048
01:32:45,736 --> 01:32:47,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been playing a lot of the newer stuff.

1049
01:32:47,796 --> 01:32:52,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I've not been moving on Diablo 4, but granted, there's not a new season until the end of the month.

1050
01:32:53,298 --> 01:32:56,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And oddly, very quiet for me on Final Fantasy XIV as well.

1051
01:32:56,098 --> 01:33:00,899
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had a lot of stuff going on after work this week, so I just didn't really have a lot of time to sit down and play it.

1052
01:33:00,959 --> 01:33:06,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe I'll get around to that next week, because I still have a new dungeon I want to play in that game.

1053
01:33:07,461 --> 01:33:23,094
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah just been a lot of other things going on still still playing Pikmin, Ingress, Pokemon Go still playing all that do you know how many fucking Burmese I've caught in Pokemon Go this last week holy moly I'm over it I don't want to see any more Burmese anymore

1054
01:33:24,172 --> 01:33:30,156
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some event going on in the game, and for whatever reason, the Burmese spawns are increased by like five times as part of the event.

1055
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:31,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's caught so many of them.

1056
01:33:31,998 --> 01:33:32,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wild.

1057
01:33:32,758 --> 01:33:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've gotten some more shinies.

1058
01:33:33,999 --> 01:33:36,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I caught a shiny Meowth today very randomly.

1059
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:38,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to... One reason why I don't...

1060
01:33:39,713 --> 01:33:40,614
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1061
01:33:59,847 --> 01:34:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do a lot of Pokemon Go catching.

1062
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep running out of Pokeballs, though.

1063
01:34:04,651 --> 01:34:15,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, I'll have to run it for a walk, and then when I drive a quick errand, I have to set it to spin stops only, and then make sure I actually get through all my fucking gifts that I can in a day, and all of that stuff.

1064
01:34:15,642 --> 01:34:20,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, Bobby in chat says, yes, Rob cleared the weekly challenges before I could contribute again.

1065
01:34:21,507 --> 01:34:22,148
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome?

1066
01:34:22,168 --> 01:34:22,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1067
01:34:24,495 --> 01:34:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but I, but I also recognize I have had a change in my own habits and that's how I'm going to be doing it because I walk a lot.

1068
01:34:34,297 --> 01:34:42,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is no, I don't feel any sort of way about other folks because I'm pushing my own goals, if that makes sense.

1069
01:34:42,499 --> 01:34:47,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, yeah, I haven't seen any shiny Burmese with all those Burmese.

1070
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you in chat.

1071
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:50,741
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a weird thing I've noticed.

1072
01:34:52,971 --> 01:34:55,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and I did do some of the mega raids.

1073
01:34:56,214 --> 01:34:58,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a mega Audino.

1074
01:34:58,596 --> 01:35:02,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been playing more Pokemon Go, I've been remembering to put my Pokemon in gyms every day.

1075
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:03,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm actually getting coins again.

1076
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:11,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually, I bought remote passes just because, God, it's so much easier to just do the Mega Adino.

1077
01:35:11,114 --> 01:35:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was a Tauros today that's regional.

1078
01:35:14,437 --> 01:35:19,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I think from, I think it's a Galarian variant, I think, that I did today.

1079
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:20,902
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been able to do that, which is nice.

1080
01:35:20,942 --> 01:35:27,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, the best quality of life thing they've put in Pokemon Go in a while is that instead of friends inviting you to raids, well, they can still do that.

1081
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:30,990
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go into your list of friends, you see who's in a raid right now.

1082
01:35:31,411 --> 01:35:32,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, like, I was like, oh...

1083
01:35:33,212 --> 01:35:35,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's doing a Pokemon that is a gray outline.

1084
01:35:35,753 --> 01:35:36,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have this yet.

1085
01:35:36,593 --> 01:35:37,173
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they doing?

1086
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:37,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1087
01:35:37,693 --> 01:35:39,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll hop in, which is kind of nice.

1088
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:41,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

1089
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my game of the week.

1090
01:35:42,795 --> 01:35:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

1091
01:35:43,455 --> 01:35:47,376
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some other stories this week that actually don't have to do a Nintendo, believe it or not.

1092
01:35:47,817 --> 01:35:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with the successes of a non-Nintendo game.

1093
01:35:53,682 --> 01:36:00,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is supposed to be kind of hinted at like a Sims killer or at least a huge competitor.

1094
01:36:00,808 --> 01:36:06,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a game called Inzoy by Krafton, as in PUBG folks.

1095
01:36:07,534 --> 01:36:16,803
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, even though it's in early access, it has topped a million sales within its week of launching.

1096
01:36:16,823 --> 01:36:17,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1097
01:36:18,344 --> 01:36:39,566
[SPEAKER_03]: and so they're really they're calling it a player friendly operational strategy and they're really excited about how many people have adopted it and that they want to be known as more than just the PUBG company they have a subsidiary studio which is Enzoi Studio that's handling this

1098
01:36:40,658 --> 01:36:55,810
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is a game that's actually on my wish list although I've been debating whether or not I'm gonna get it because I need to know a little bit more about how their AI technology works in it because apparently you can use AI tools in the game to give it a prompt and then it will make like a

1099
01:36:56,010 --> 01:37:00,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Pattern or something like patterns for clothing and things like that.

1100
01:37:01,475 --> 01:37:03,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need to know a little bit more about it.

1101
01:37:03,636 --> 01:37:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if it's all in-house art generated or how much of user input it uses to train their models.

1102
01:37:10,442 --> 01:37:11,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know enough about it.

1103
01:37:12,263 --> 01:37:16,967
[SPEAKER_03]: But it definitely looks prettier than the Sims games.

1104
01:37:17,287 --> 01:37:22,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still stylized, but it almost looks like what a lot of my Sims mods look like.

1105
01:37:25,794 --> 01:37:48,779
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's I think I might take the plunge on it but it certainly is and there's already videos out there too with people building a house in the Sims and then rebuilding it in Enzoi and showing the comparison between how the building tools work and apparently Enzoi's building tools are a lot more intuitive

1106
01:37:49,588 --> 01:38:14,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know a lot about this game at all besides what you're saying now so I brought up a YouTube to play us some b-roll somebody's playing a long play right now and it's like they're putting together like this they're choosing to put crocodiles in their animal sanctuary then they have like lights that glow and all this looks very um fancy very fancy it's very pretty like and I I'm pretty sure that my Mac would play it with no problem I am it's it's

1107
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:29,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a little bit more realism, but it also has that sort of, I don't know, it just has that specific aesthetic that you see in like watching Asian dramas.

1108
01:38:30,992 --> 01:38:32,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way I can describe it.

1109
01:38:33,021 --> 01:38:33,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1110
01:38:34,402 --> 01:38:36,302
[SPEAKER_05]: This game was totally not on my radar.

1111
01:38:37,363 --> 01:38:37,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of feel.

1112
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:38,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $40.

1113
01:38:39,944 --> 01:38:42,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So on top of that, it's actually not like Duke Nukem.

1114
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:46,147
[SPEAKER_05]: That character did look kind of like Duke Nukem.

1115
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:46,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really funny.

1116
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:48,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1117
01:38:48,868 --> 01:38:49,628
[SPEAKER_02]: But isn't it really pretty?

1118
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:52,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the graphics in this are gorgeous.

1119
01:38:52,569 --> 01:38:53,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

1120
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:57,231
[SPEAKER_05]: QuestBuster in chat says there's already a ton of mods available for this.

1121
01:38:57,711 --> 01:39:01,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's also that, even though it's early access.

1122
01:39:01,877 --> 01:39:28,949
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah and my thing is that while I would love to do the mods I would have to figure out how to if it will run into whiskey and then if I can make my mods run through whiskey so wish me luck if I decide to go that route good luck all right well I look forward to potentially you streaming this game in the future who knows all right god I need I need more nights in the week yeah mood I'm not quitting ballet to stream again uh Loki you have more on the Minecraft movie

1123
01:39:29,815 --> 01:39:37,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so ironically enough, there has been an early work print of Minecraft the movie that has leaked online.

1124
01:39:38,517 --> 01:39:43,118
[SPEAKER_08]: It was with unfinished visuals and different editing.

1125
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:54,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And funny enough, I actually took a look at it, and there are some extended parts of this that are not in the movie that they decided to cut out for whatever reason.

1126
01:39:54,581 --> 01:39:55,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there are some spots like...

1127
01:39:57,342 --> 01:40:03,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It felt very sudden or unexplained, and then there's additional context with some of these deleted scenes as well.

1128
01:40:05,104 --> 01:40:09,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an interesting look at the movie-making process, but I'm sure that Warner Bros.

1129
01:40:09,585 --> 01:40:10,365
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't too happy about it.

1130
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:11,946
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, I don't care what Warner Bros.

1131
01:40:11,966 --> 01:40:19,888
[SPEAKER_08]: thinks, because it made it such a hassle to get the new Looney Tunes Acme vs. Coyote movie out, so to hell with them.

1132
01:40:22,148 --> 01:40:23,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, but we're finally going to get that movie!

1133
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exciting.

1134
01:40:25,991 --> 01:40:26,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1135
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:36,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel the way about seeing those deleted scenes in context with having already seen a movie that it adds to your experience in watching the movie?

1136
01:40:36,819 --> 01:40:37,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

1137
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to give away too much.

1138
01:40:40,062 --> 01:40:44,485
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this weird gag that they keep saying that Steve smells.

1139
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:47,968
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, why do I smell like cheese?

1140
01:40:48,088 --> 01:40:51,751
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, well, I like to keep a piece of gorgonzola in my front pocket.

1141
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:53,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never explained...

1142
01:40:54,867 --> 01:40:55,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Why he does that.

1143
01:40:55,948 --> 01:40:58,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's just a weird, like, oh, he's just weird, and he does that.

1144
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:08,319
[SPEAKER_08]: But, like, in the work print, he explains, I keep this in my front pocket because it's my best friend's favorite food, and I miss him so much.

1145
01:41:08,379 --> 01:41:10,521
[SPEAKER_08]: He's talking about his dog that he's trying to save.

1146
01:41:10,922 --> 01:41:14,665
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it gives additional context to that, like, that it's missing from the movie.

1147
01:41:14,705 --> 01:41:17,968
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really only a few seconds, but for whatever reason, they chose to cut it out.

1148
01:41:18,188 --> 01:41:20,730
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also another scene when they go to the Woodland Mansion where they're like,

1149
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:26,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to run interference by singing this song and dance with these saxophones or whatever.

1150
01:41:27,675 --> 01:41:29,576
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just kind of out of nowhere.

1151
01:41:29,996 --> 01:41:31,337
[SPEAKER_08]: But the beginning, they...

1152
01:41:32,538 --> 01:41:40,542
[SPEAKER_08]: This cut of it has it where they are talking about, oh yeah, we're going to do a birthday gram type thing.

1153
01:41:40,742 --> 01:41:47,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they have added context to it that's not in the movie, but they cut it out to save on runtime or something.

1154
01:41:48,206 --> 01:41:48,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know.

1155
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:49,607
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.

1156
01:41:50,267 --> 01:41:54,009
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also another musical number that's kind of cut out as well from the office scene.

1157
01:41:54,069 --> 01:41:57,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, it's pretty similar.

1158
01:41:57,751 --> 01:41:58,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just cut down a bit.

1159
01:41:58,792 --> 01:41:59,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess you'll see these...

1160
01:42:00,993 --> 01:42:01,253
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1161
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that with movies too yeah I think deleted scenes can be fun like the types that give the additional context and things they cut out yeah sometimes they're pointless but sometimes they're interesting I want to talk about this story that has to do with good old Billy Mitchell whose name continues to come up throughout the gaming industry and all this although this is an interesting story because even though it's about Billy Mitchell and a lot of the

1162
01:42:59,246 --> 01:43:00,207
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1163
01:43:15,883 --> 01:43:29,734
[SPEAKER_05]: and this has to do with the fact that Billy Mitchell was basically the recipient of this law determination where a YouTuber named Carl Jobst will have to pay over $230,000

1164
01:43:33,477 --> 01:43:41,843
[SPEAKER_05]: in damages to Billy Mitchell because of defamatory comments that were found made by Carl Jobst in a video that was published back in 2001.

1165
01:43:42,223 --> 01:43:50,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not sure if that $237,000, if that is an Australian dollar figure or if that's converted into U.S.

1166
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,429
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars.

1167
01:43:50,509 --> 01:43:51,910
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's converted to U.S.

1168
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,771
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right, it is.

1169
01:43:52,791 --> 01:43:54,372
[SPEAKER_08]: $380,000 Australian dollars.

1170
01:43:54,472 --> 01:43:54,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1171
01:43:56,073 --> 01:43:56,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1172
01:43:56,994 --> 01:43:59,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby says, I'm in the same YouTube video.

1173
01:44:00,396 --> 01:44:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that so Bobby Blackwolf was in an Australian court of law at some point in this video because okay so Bobby did some panel at Southern Pride Game Expo that had Billy Mitchell on it but Billy Mitchell in Billy Mitchell's way kind of took over that whole fucking panel and Bobby really didn't get to get a word in edgewise and so he's there

1174
01:44:24,737 --> 01:44:25,418
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1175
01:44:39,921 --> 01:44:40,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Defamation.

1176
01:44:41,122 --> 01:44:43,023
[SPEAKER_05]: It was found that Carl Jobst has to pay.

1177
01:44:43,063 --> 01:44:43,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's why.

1178
01:44:44,144 --> 01:44:47,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually has nothing to do with the Donkey Kong scandal.

1179
01:44:48,127 --> 01:44:51,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that he was calling out the scandal or anything like that.

1180
01:44:52,029 --> 01:44:52,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1181
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:58,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The video was called The Biggest Con Men in Video Game History Strike Again.

1182
01:44:59,074 --> 01:45:22,891
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically implied in the video that the settlement that Billy Mitchell did with another YouTuber, Benjamin Smith or Apollo Legend, who had done several videos claiming Billy Mitchell had cheated, basically said that, you know, as a result of the cheating thing, that Benjamin Smith had to pay a large sum of money and unfortunately took his own life in 2020, you know,

1183
01:45:25,373 --> 01:45:25,893
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1184
01:45:48,220 --> 01:45:50,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the defamation.

1185
01:45:51,103 --> 01:45:56,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Insinuating that Billy Mitchell took delight in this other YouTuber taking his own life.

1186
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:58,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the problem.

1187
01:45:58,849 --> 01:46:01,351
[SPEAKER_05]: It had nothing to do with the actual Donkey Kong.

1188
01:46:01,371 --> 01:46:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It had nothing to do with the video game at the end of the day.

1189
01:46:03,873 --> 01:46:13,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything to do with the really strange cult of celebrity that continues to surround a lot of these Twin Galaxy folks, but mostly Billy Mitchell.

1190
01:46:15,034 --> 01:46:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that was it.

1191
01:46:16,054 --> 01:46:22,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So the judge, Ken Barlow, said that the 2020 settlement between Mitchell and Smith never involved the exchange of money.

1192
01:46:22,737 --> 01:46:33,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Smith had to remove all the YouTube video and social media posts that were relating, assign copyright, and to cease publishing about Billy Mitchell or would have a $25,000 fine for each breach.

1193
01:46:34,202 --> 01:46:36,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were some other claims made in the video that were found to be untrue.

1194
01:46:38,063 --> 01:46:41,785
[SPEAKER_05]: In a post on X, Jope said, I lost...

1195
01:46:42,045 --> 01:46:42,465
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1196
01:47:03,021 --> 01:47:04,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought he would win that case, honestly.

1197
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:05,964
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm surprised.

1198
01:47:06,084 --> 01:47:08,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't YouTubers sometimes need to be held accountable for some of this?

1199
01:47:09,487 --> 01:47:12,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of this hysteria has to have a point.

1200
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:18,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would have a problem if somebody said that I took delight in somebody taking their own life.

1201
01:47:19,495 --> 01:47:21,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have a real problem with that.

1202
01:47:21,497 --> 01:47:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, talk all the shit you want about Donkey Kong, but there are certain lines that should not be crossed for the sake of clicks.

1203
01:47:29,402 --> 01:47:57,922
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know that was just that's that's not great optics um I I have not seen the video because I don't give a fuck about this situation I haven't given a fuck about it for a long time and I've never nor should I give a fuck nor should anybody give a fuck about this situation as far as I'm concerned but here we are anyway just consider if you're gonna do a video to hate on somebody

1204
01:47:59,733 --> 01:48:05,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you actually helping that person more than... Forget it.

1205
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:07,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm yelling at a wall.

1206
01:48:08,481 --> 01:48:10,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1207
01:48:10,382 --> 01:48:10,903
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1208
01:48:13,297 --> 01:48:15,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some shit news.

1209
01:48:16,638 --> 01:48:17,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna call it like it is.

1210
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Eidos Montreal laid off 75 developers.

1211
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:32,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pulling their mandate to restructure the company and apply their staff and finish their projects.

1212
01:48:33,043 --> 01:48:36,844
[SPEAKER_03]: And once all that came to fruition, they...

1213
01:48:38,184 --> 01:48:39,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just read the quote.

1214
01:48:39,085 --> 01:48:47,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members as one of our mandates is coming to an end.

1215
01:48:47,828 --> 01:48:56,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately we don't have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.

1216
01:48:58,013 --> 01:49:02,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you value them so much, why aren't you putting more effort into it?

1217
01:49:04,213 --> 01:49:31,336
[SPEAKER_03]: um and they go on to say that they are quote committed to deliver its other projects currently in development which is supposed to be Fable I guess anyway um so and another GameLoss jobs version Australian studio uh PlaySide is uh also doing layoffs even after they have made record revenue for them um

1218
01:49:32,736 --> 01:49:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: they've pulled in 64.6 million Australian dollars which would be about 40.9 million US and that they were it was triggered by delays for winning work for higher contracts and they want new winning new contract work but said that things remain uncertain for them so

1219
01:50:01,485 --> 01:50:01,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1220
01:50:03,086 --> 01:50:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Just bleh.

1221
01:50:04,948 --> 01:50:06,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1222
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:08,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Bleh!

1223
01:50:08,551 --> 01:50:15,177
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a complicated... Continues to be a very complicated issue because there's a lot of people that are going to point to...

1224
01:50:16,297 --> 01:50:20,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't like to hear these types of stories, but you don't want to pay $80 for a video game.

1225
01:50:21,562 --> 01:50:25,145
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think fundamentally, the system is just kind of broken.

1226
01:50:25,625 --> 01:50:33,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it came to a point that several people were saying in chat earlier about the bubble is bursting on AAA games is what it's really coming down to.

1227
01:50:33,712 --> 01:50:39,697
[SPEAKER_05]: The bubble is really bursting on AAA games, which to some extent has been the case with AAA movies for a bit, too.

1228
01:50:39,757 --> 01:50:40,978
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to greenlight movies anymore.

1229
01:50:41,238 --> 01:50:42,540
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1230
01:51:05,822 --> 01:51:10,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a return on investment by charging $40 or $50 a game versus $80.

1231
01:51:10,744 --> 01:51:14,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's this weird reckoning we're in within the industry.

1232
01:51:14,665 --> 01:51:19,946
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it's still very sad news to hear across the board.

1233
01:51:20,046 --> 01:51:25,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the entire industry really needs to re-advise, especially those at the top.

1234
01:51:25,328 --> 01:51:29,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some companies recognize it better than others.

1235
01:51:29,529 --> 01:51:31,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's directly with who's at the top.

1236
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, you look at the decision Ubisoft makes.

1237
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:38,572
[SPEAKER_05]: How that company's still in business, I don't know sometimes.

1238
01:51:39,153 --> 01:51:41,874
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you look at the decisions that other companies make.

1239
01:51:42,595 --> 01:51:48,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So far, up until this week, Nintendo was riding quite the high.

1240
01:51:49,519 --> 01:51:52,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be interesting now to see if that continues for them.

1241
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:57,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not sure even I want to take a crystal ball to that, to see how this is going to go.

1242
01:51:57,503 --> 01:52:02,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think there is too much unpredictability with what's going on with our dear leader.

1243
01:52:03,871 --> 01:52:08,554
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, let's talk about some good news, something you were excited about.

1244
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:10,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Go direct.

1245
01:52:10,356 --> 01:52:10,836
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1246
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:20,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the April 1st Goat Simulator announcement video where they talked about different updates and things coming to the Goat Simulator game.

1247
01:52:22,384 --> 01:52:24,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly side projects.

1248
01:52:24,786 --> 01:52:28,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for example, one of the first things that they announced was the Goat Simulator game.

1249
01:52:29,329 --> 01:52:30,230
[SPEAKER_08]: The Card Game.

1250
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:34,833
[SPEAKER_08]: They are giving you a physical card game that is launching on Kickstarter April 30th.

1251
01:52:35,813 --> 01:52:46,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And it allows you to play a goat simulator type game with all the different goats and gear that they have in the game.

1252
01:52:46,881 --> 01:52:49,743
[SPEAKER_08]: All the goats!

1253
01:52:51,324 --> 01:52:52,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, yep, yep.

1254
01:52:53,925 --> 01:52:55,446
[SPEAKER_05]: More goats in Goat Simulator?

1255
01:52:55,526 --> 01:52:56,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't say.

1256
01:52:58,241 --> 01:53:11,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have the Goat Simulator cross CRKD, the Nitro Deck and Neo S. They are a, it's basically like a little Goat Simulator themed wireless controller.

1257
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:16,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if this is something that plugs into like the Steam Deck or it's like a Steam Deck type thing.

1258
01:53:19,052 --> 01:53:24,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a new controller collection and console decked out for themed artwork.

1259
01:53:24,727 --> 01:53:25,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Nitro Deck.

1260
01:53:26,368 --> 01:53:31,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, apparently it's also those work with the Nintendo Switch as well, Bluetooth controllers.

1261
01:53:32,512 --> 01:53:33,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat, I guess.

1262
01:53:33,853 --> 01:53:35,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know what those things are.

1263
01:53:36,894 --> 01:53:42,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Then for the actual game itself, there was the Goat Simulator 3 Gifts from the Rift.

1264
01:53:43,178 --> 01:53:44,119
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 27 new gear items.

1265
01:53:47,921 --> 01:53:48,421
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1266
01:54:17,037 --> 01:54:19,320
[SPEAKER_08]: but didn't really say what it is.

1267
01:54:20,641 --> 01:54:22,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just coming and being worked on.

1268
01:54:23,124 --> 01:54:25,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have to see what that is.

1269
01:54:25,587 --> 01:54:28,670
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's anything like the last one, it should be pretty good.

1270
01:54:29,971 --> 01:54:33,675
[SPEAKER_05]: How much money did you lose watching this Goat Simulator Direct?

1271
01:54:33,715 --> 01:54:35,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning, what are you planning on buying in the future?

1272
01:54:37,335 --> 01:54:38,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll buy the new DLC when it comes out.

1273
01:54:39,036 --> 01:54:43,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know what it is and when it's coming out.

1274
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:48,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm definitely not buying the board game, nor am I getting the plushie or the controllers.

1275
01:54:49,084 --> 01:54:57,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get into it at all, but if you want to hear an industry that's getting fucked by our dear leader and their tariff situation, look at what's happening with board games.

1276
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby detailed this on his show a lot tonight, especially indie published board games.

1277
01:55:02,415 --> 01:55:04,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Those that, you know, have the indie stuff that's published overseas.

1278
01:55:05,338 --> 01:55:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an industry that is going to be disrupted majorly by all of this Washington fuckery that's happening.

1279
01:55:12,366 --> 01:55:13,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

1280
01:55:14,829 --> 01:55:15,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1281
01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:16,430
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1282
01:55:16,811 --> 01:55:16,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

1283
01:55:16,971 --> 01:55:17,991
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1284
01:55:34,657 --> 01:55:36,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the concept of the Evercade's pretty cool.

1285
01:55:36,658 --> 01:55:44,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's an emulator with cartridges, but I still like the collection concept and, you know, the fact that, you know, it's a pretty nice piece of hardware to play this stuff on.

1286
01:55:45,162 --> 01:55:47,664
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another piece of hardware that's been announced that's coming out.

1287
01:55:48,024 --> 01:55:50,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Super Pocket Neo Geo Edition.

1288
01:55:50,985 --> 01:55:55,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a $60 handheld, not a terrible price, that's set to release in June 2025.

1289
01:55:56,128 --> 01:55:57,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, assuming that, you know...

1290
01:55:58,889 --> 01:56:01,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything fucky going on at Washington doesn't double that price.

1291
01:56:01,932 --> 01:56:03,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just assume for now it's going to stay $60.

1292
01:56:03,714 --> 01:56:12,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a Neo Geo Pocket Super Pocket Edition that will have SNK arcade games in it.

1293
01:56:12,862 --> 01:56:18,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a black and gold color scheme that looks like a Neo Geo arcade cabinet and has 14 titles built in.

1294
01:56:19,688 --> 01:56:38,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Mission 2, Blazing Star, Fatal Fury Special, King of the Monsters 2 The Next Thing, Last Resort, Metal Slug X, Mutation Nation, Overtop, Samurai Shodown 2, Sengoku 3, Shock Troopers Second Squad, Soccer Brawl, The Last Blade, and Top Hunter, Roddy and Kathy.

1295
01:56:39,894 --> 01:56:41,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking love Last Blade.

1296
01:56:41,803 --> 01:56:58,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Top Hunter there's a lot of those on Blue Sky but anyway I don't know I don't know that game as well um DarkSakura though you're a Neo Geo fan what do you think of this lineup it's pretty seems pretty solid to me Last Blade worth it for Last Blade fair enough um

1297
01:57:00,245 --> 01:57:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I believe they are also releasing a cartridge that just has six of those games in it.

1298
01:57:05,648 --> 01:57:10,150
[SPEAKER_05]: There also is a Data East version, which is ironic because it's off camera a little bit.

1299
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:15,232
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look way to the side, I do have a Data East Arcade 1UP cabinet that has some of these games.

1300
01:57:15,332 --> 01:57:21,575
[SPEAKER_05]: There also is a Pocket Data East Edition coming that, of course, has BurgerTime, of course, Bad Dudes and Dragon Ninja and Joe and Mac.

1301
01:57:21,856 --> 01:57:27,238
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also has one of the sequels, Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory, Lock and Chase, TumblePop.

1302
01:57:27,518 --> 01:57:28,939
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of interesting games there.

1303
01:57:29,479 --> 01:57:31,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see if we had the Neo Geo.

1304
01:57:32,101 --> 01:57:38,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the, now I do like the limited edition with the red and white stripes.

1305
01:57:38,966 --> 01:57:40,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, there's a limited edition.

1306
01:57:40,647 --> 01:57:41,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that looks cool.

1307
01:57:42,268 --> 01:57:52,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there is also an Evercade cartridge coming, Neo Geo Arcade 1, implying the existence of more than one at some point, but this is all we know about so far.

1308
01:57:52,735 --> 01:57:58,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be a cartridge that you could put into any device, which would include the machine behind me,

1309
01:57:59,779 --> 01:58:07,743
[SPEAKER_05]: which would have Metal Slug, King of Fighters 2000, Sengoku, Magician Lord, Shock Troopers, and Ironclad.

1310
01:58:08,704 --> 01:58:13,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a bad lineup for one singular cartridge that will play on all the other Evercade devices.

1311
01:58:14,667 --> 01:58:15,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty rad.

1312
01:58:16,547 --> 01:58:23,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep in mind, these Neo Geo Super Pockets, they will have the 14 games built in, but then you can use the cartridges to add more.

1313
01:58:23,931 --> 01:58:52,254
[SPEAKER_05]: that's very similar to the bad boy that sits behind me here it has the Mega Man so I know it's hard to see but it has some Capcom classics built in like Arcade Strider, Mega Man Power Battle 1 and 2 that's what the marquee theming is Final Fight are all in here but they are like they're baked into the firmware on this machine so they're not cartridges so ironically what I have in here right now I have the Mega Man and then I have two Namco cartridges in there so it's like a Cap...

1314
01:58:52,654 --> 01:58:58,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Cap Namco arcade machine I have behind me right now but the one thing I can't do Ms.

1315
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:00,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man isn't on the cartridge so I can't have Ms.

1316
01:59:00,602 --> 01:59:13,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man on both anyway no all right since I brought up classic games this is a great time to get to our next segment let's get to it our sort of classic game of the week

1317
01:59:24,409 --> 01:59:31,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1318
01:59:32,152 --> 01:59:34,753
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1319
01:59:35,473 --> 01:59:48,918
[SPEAKER_05]: But in a 2025 twist, once a month, DarkSakura likes to instead pick a classic game to arcade, meaning this was once a console game but became an arcade game.

1320
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:51,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura, what is the classic game to arcade this week?

1321
01:59:55,516 --> 01:59:59,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantasy Zone 2, The Tears of Opa Opa, Opa Opa no Namida

1322
02:00:18,835 --> 02:00:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: with ports all over the place and basically it's Opa Opa fighting his inner darkness and the game of course plays like Defender very similar with the big final boss and you have the shop you can buy stuff in and what not but there are there was an arcade version that was definitely

1323
02:00:46,048 --> 02:01:11,985
[SPEAKER_03]: prettied up, made very nice and so it was done on the system e-board and that first one is almost identical to the Master System version it has a radar that shows you if your bases are destroyed or not a timer that if it reaches zero you'll lose life if you clear a level then your remaining seconds will be added to the score

1324
02:01:13,145 --> 02:01:37,943
[SPEAKER_03]: um and uh this is uh this is okay but then there was the remake of Fantasy Zone 2 um and that was for System 16 um it was this is the one that's that's pretty and it is the considered a what if um

1325
02:01:40,056 --> 02:01:48,410
[SPEAKER_03]: and the point of it was to stick to what would have been the technical limitations of

1326
02:01:50,046 --> 02:01:54,568
[SPEAKER_03]: The game, if it would have been released at this time, this is in September 2008.

1327
02:01:54,608 --> 02:02:03,533
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like if it had come out in arcades when it was supposed to have been released.

1328
02:02:03,713 --> 02:02:14,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And the M2 CEO, Hori Naoki, had stated that the remake was inspired by his disappointment that Fantasy Zone didn't get a true arcade sequel.

1329
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the SMS game a lot, but in my heart of hearts, I really wanted to see it on arcade hardware.

1330
02:02:22,703 --> 02:02:33,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they developed it on real System 16 hardware, only increasing the memory to 256 kilobytes.

1331
02:02:33,388 --> 02:02:35,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they called this the System 16 C.

1332
02:02:37,971 --> 02:02:51,721
[SPEAKER_03]: and it can even be played through their own emulation tech so it has a 1987 Sega copyright no mention of M2 and has really no other distinction from the original game

1333
02:02:53,322 --> 02:02:55,883
[SPEAKER_03]: and it looks just like an arcade game from 1987.

1334
02:02:56,664 --> 02:03:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Some fans have even called this Fantasy Zone 2 DX to tell it apart from the original arcade release.

1335
02:03:05,490 --> 02:03:10,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one that I have those very, very fun memories of.

1336
02:03:11,814 --> 02:03:16,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ohori actually funded this himself.

1337
02:03:17,318 --> 02:03:21,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently he said it cost about the same amount as a new car in 2008.

1338
02:03:23,101 --> 02:03:45,734
[SPEAKER_03]: so it does follow Phantasy Zone 2 but a bit loosely it has enemies, music locations, and gameplay elements from the Master System games but it sets up new content and elements of the original Phantasy Zone so instead of having the distinct zones in each stage you have two parallel dimensions, the bright side and dark side

1339
02:03:46,995 --> 02:04:05,675
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are comparable to the levels in the original fantasy zone you destroy the bases in one dimension they destroy in the other the dark side is more difficult but you get more rewards but the bosses are same on either side although they are more difficult to fight on the dark side

1340
02:04:06,215 --> 02:04:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So the game has three endings which depend on whether dark side levels were cleared and whether some specific items were bought.

1341
02:04:15,597 --> 02:04:17,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting the bad ending gives you a game over.

1342
02:04:19,178 --> 02:04:35,821
[SPEAKER_03]: The music was arranged by Namiki Manabu and it has many of the songs from the Fantasy Zone 2 soundtrack but rearranged to be more stylistically to how the Fantasy Zone's original composer Kawaguchi Hiroshi would have

1343
02:04:36,461 --> 02:04:36,961
[SPEAKER_03]: arrange them.

1344
02:04:38,722 --> 02:04:41,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Stages and enemies are based off the themes from the original.

1345
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:43,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are a little bit different.

1346
02:04:44,763 --> 02:04:48,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And only half the game's bosses correspond to those who are in the original.

1347
02:04:49,284 --> 02:04:51,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very loose interpretation.

1348
02:04:53,385 --> 02:05:03,027
[SPEAKER_03]: M2 did a free demo of their version of Phantasy Zone 2 on their website so that users could download and play the first and second levels on a Windows computer.

1349
02:05:03,127 --> 02:05:04,247
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, it had been

1350
02:05:04,947 --> 02:05:19,136
[SPEAKER_03]: bootlegged and released in arcades as FZ-2006-2 by a Taiwanese manufacturer called ISG it has a 2006 copyright date but apparently it's based off of the 2008 Playstation 2 release

1351
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:37,153
[SPEAKER_03]: because of a string recognized from the ROM data Sega did a limited number of arcade units that ran this on System 16 hardware instead of the emulated System 16 hardware from other releases

1352
02:05:39,435 --> 02:05:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, this particular version also was ported to the Nintendo 3DS version of Fantasy Zone 2.

1353
02:05:49,661 --> 02:05:54,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was called 3D Fantasy Zone 2W with new features and content.

1354
02:05:54,984 --> 02:06:00,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could also do it in the survival mode with Oopa Oopa, who is Oopa Oopa's brother.

1355
02:06:02,036 --> 02:06:29,200
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's kind of like that this was and this to me is like my favorite version of Fantasy Zone 2 but it's like they took Fantasy Zone 2 for the Master System did an arcade version did a remake of the arcade version and then ported that back to console but there you go yeah so that is Fantasy Zone 2 Opa Opa no Namida

1356
02:06:29,537 --> 02:06:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, did you get a chance to play this in arcades?

1357
02:06:32,746 --> 02:06:33,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, heck yeah!

1358
02:06:33,588 --> 02:06:36,276
[SPEAKER_03]: They had one at, um... Uh...

1359
02:06:37,017 --> 02:07:00,451
[SPEAKER_03]: California Extreme a couple years ago and I think I spent a lot of time on this game and it's funny as much as I love Fantasy Zone I'm not really good when it comes to the bosses like I make stupid mistakes that's my problem because I'm too busy just getting into the vibe of the game but yeah they had this and it was a real one on a candy cab

1360
02:07:03,013 --> 02:07:06,057
[SPEAKER_03]: at California Extreme a couple years ago and I keep hoping that they bring it back.

1361
02:07:06,497 --> 02:07:09,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to fucking get to California Extreme this year.

1362
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:12,944
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always something going on the same weekend though but maybe this year.

1363
02:07:12,964 --> 02:07:14,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what weekend it is yet?

1364
02:07:14,706 --> 02:07:15,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a hotel room last time.

1365
02:07:16,067 --> 02:07:16,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll do it again.

1366
02:07:16,948 --> 02:07:18,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know what weekend it is yet?

1367
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to block off that weekend.

1368
02:07:20,882 --> 02:07:21,503
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

1369
02:07:21,743 --> 02:07:22,243
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll see.

1370
02:07:22,424 --> 02:07:22,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1371
02:07:23,705 --> 02:07:24,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Orange Rite.

1372
02:07:24,586 --> 02:07:27,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Rite in chat says Fantasy Zone.

1373
02:07:28,209 --> 02:07:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

1374
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:29,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1375
02:07:29,251 --> 02:07:31,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why the follow noises from my personal stream come over here.

1376
02:07:32,033 --> 02:07:33,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have not figured that out.

1377
02:07:33,094 --> 02:07:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry you get the random windows.

1378
02:07:34,336 --> 02:07:35,197
[SPEAKER_03]: July 19th through 20th.

1379
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:38,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to check my calendar for that weekend.

1380
02:07:38,821 --> 02:07:41,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Rite says Fantasy Zone 2DX, huh?

1381
02:07:42,122 --> 02:07:43,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that little pun.

1382
02:07:44,443 --> 02:07:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute.

1383
02:07:45,243 --> 02:07:47,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it does predate 2DX, but yeah.

1384
02:07:47,784 --> 02:07:48,285
[SPEAKER_03]: No, does it?

1385
02:07:49,005 --> 02:07:50,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of contemporary, actually, I guess.

1386
02:07:51,966 --> 02:07:53,146
[SPEAKER_05]: You said 19th and 20th?

1387
02:07:54,707 --> 02:07:54,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1388
02:07:55,447 --> 02:07:57,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, I am currently available that weekend.

1389
02:07:57,708 --> 02:07:59,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the next weekend I'm hosting a show.

1390
02:07:59,489 --> 02:08:00,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what happened to me last year.

1391
02:08:00,609 --> 02:08:01,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hosting a show that weekend.

1392
02:08:01,730 --> 02:08:02,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to.

1393
02:08:02,455 --> 02:08:05,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Double check when my ballet recital is because it's in July.

1394
02:08:06,517 --> 02:08:06,778
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1395
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:08,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

1396
02:08:08,459 --> 02:08:09,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.

1397
02:08:09,839 --> 02:08:10,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to go.

1398
02:08:11,741 --> 02:08:15,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's move on to another story.

1399
02:08:15,823 --> 02:08:16,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, a series of stories.

1400
02:08:16,684 --> 02:08:22,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do some rapid fire news and talk about a few headlines that all that Nintendo Switch news, Switch 2 news at the beginning.

1401
02:08:23,748 --> 02:08:28,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have to run through a few other headlines pretty quickly because again, if you're just joining us,

1402
02:08:28,891 --> 02:08:34,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked a lot about the Switch 2 in the opening hour of the show tonight, so we're trying to cover some of the other headlines at this point.

1403
02:08:35,338 --> 02:08:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Do remember you can always download this show as a podcast where all of your favorite podcasts are served, whether that is Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube has podcasting built in as well.

1404
02:08:45,729 --> 02:08:47,971
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news.

1405
02:08:48,031 --> 02:08:48,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1406
02:08:49,515 --> 02:08:54,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon Go Fest 2025 has been announced, and we have the dates now for those.

1407
02:08:54,756 --> 02:09:06,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be in Osaka, Japan, May 29th through June 1st, Jersey City from June 6th to the 8th, and Paris, France, June 13th through the 15th.

1408
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:11,061
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get your tickets now, or you can participate...

1409
02:09:13,018 --> 02:09:13,398
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

1410
02:09:31,371 --> 02:09:31,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Neat.

1411
02:09:32,451 --> 02:09:36,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm enjoying a Pokemon Go renaissance right now, so it sounds kind of exciting.

1412
02:09:36,232 --> 02:09:40,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, we still have to feel out how is the Scopely sale going to change things.

1413
02:09:40,874 --> 02:09:44,294
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I'm not going to react to predictions.

1414
02:09:44,855 --> 02:09:48,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to react to what they announce, the changes they're going to make.

1415
02:09:50,721 --> 02:09:51,622
[SPEAKER_05]: when they decide to make them.

1416
02:09:51,702 --> 02:10:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I will say on that same front, I don't know if you heard about this, they did announce this week that because Wayfarer, Niantic Wayfarer was sold to Scopely as well, they're going to be splitting the database of points of interest.

1417
02:10:05,749 --> 02:10:17,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So at an undisclosed date in the future, probably when this whole deal closes, the network that powers Ingress portals will now be separate from the network that powers

1418
02:10:18,516 --> 02:10:27,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Go, Pokestops, Pikmin Mushrooms, and whatever it was called in Monster Hunter now, the zones or whatever they are in those.

1419
02:10:28,006 --> 02:10:30,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which is the way it should have been from the very beginning.

1420
02:10:30,228 --> 02:10:35,414
[SPEAKER_05]: PvP and PvE should have never been mixed, but I understand that was not Niantic's goal in this whole thing.

1421
02:10:35,774 --> 02:10:37,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's going to be very interesting with this split.

1422
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:40,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was playing Ingress the other day.

1423
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:52,086
[SPEAKER_05]: and I was in a neighborhood and there was something called a geo marker that somebody had submitted and got added and you could tell this was a big Pokemon Go neighborhood where they submitted every little fucking thing as Pokemon Go.

1424
02:10:52,446 --> 02:10:54,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what this thing was that they got in Pokemon Go?

1425
02:10:55,248 --> 02:11:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those little tiny ass fucking quarter sized markers that they put at the boundary of a house to denote where one property stops and the other one begins.

1426
02:11:05,851 --> 02:11:06,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a Pokestop.

1427
02:11:07,812 --> 02:11:11,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I cannot wait for this bullshit to no longer be in Ingress.

1428
02:11:12,833 --> 02:11:15,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, I don't care about Pokestops.

1429
02:11:15,174 --> 02:11:17,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokestops in front of people's houses, I don't give a shit about.

1430
02:11:18,195 --> 02:11:22,436
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's when people in that game unfortunately get very selfish.

1431
02:11:22,516 --> 02:11:25,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I've literally heard Pokemon Go players say, who cares about Ingress?

1432
02:11:26,217 --> 02:11:27,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares about the other games?

1433
02:11:27,678 --> 02:11:28,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1434
02:11:28,578 --> 02:11:29,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their problem.

1435
02:11:29,918 --> 02:11:34,360
[SPEAKER_05]: To which I say, and for those on the podcast feed, I'm raising my middle finger.

1436
02:11:35,336 --> 02:11:38,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1437
02:11:39,157 --> 02:11:39,677
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1438
02:11:42,558 --> 02:11:51,141
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Squinnix has launched a website for Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary.

1439
02:11:53,422 --> 02:12:00,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a mention of a picture book, the Final Fantasy IX picture book, VV, Grandpa, and the Day of Departure.

1440
02:12:01,524 --> 02:12:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a lottery with details to be announced Zoff vs. Final Fantasy IX Collaboration Glasses due out in July Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary Official Goods and then a vinyl called the Anniversary Vinyl Timeless Tale due on July 9th for 4,950 yen so yay yay

1441
02:12:29,839 --> 02:12:33,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a story that is a yay for game preservation actually.

1442
02:12:34,241 --> 02:12:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockman Cosmo on social media has discussed a 23 title game preservation effort for Konami mobile games.

1443
02:12:46,185 --> 02:12:49,867
[SPEAKER_05]: These were originally developed for iMode compatible Japanese phones.

1444
02:12:50,707 --> 02:12:53,628
[SPEAKER_05]: These games have now been dumped and preserved online.

1445
02:12:53,968 --> 02:12:54,269
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

1446
02:13:10,409 --> 02:13:22,455
[SPEAKER_05]: In the report on social media from Rockman Cosmo, it talked about Gradius Neo, Gradius Neo Imperial, because these were exclusive to this platform, as well as Castlevania, Twimby, Parodius.

1447
02:13:22,835 --> 02:13:23,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty cool.

1448
02:13:23,436 --> 02:13:28,098
[SPEAKER_05]: These were originally launched around 2004 for iMode and Yahoo!

1449
02:13:28,458 --> 02:13:33,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Kei Tai compatible phones, eventually making their way to EasyWeb phones as well.

1450
02:13:34,641 --> 02:13:35,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Kei Tai means cell phone.

1451
02:13:36,201 --> 02:13:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Keita Isobo.

1452
02:13:37,062 --> 02:13:38,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1453
02:13:38,204 --> 02:13:45,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there's a big old list of the games that have been preserved, and there is actually a Discord from the Keita Wiki.

1454
02:13:46,615 --> 02:13:53,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that was a thing until now, but KeitaWiki.com, where you can get those games and the efforts to save them and preserve them.

1455
02:13:54,085 --> 02:14:22,703
[SPEAKER_05]: that's pretty cool even if like I'm pretty sure we had very similar versions of these games on like remember I used to have this sprint flip phone that played these color games and like there were so I had like a Castlevania game on it it ran like shit it ran like shit but it kind of looked like Castlevania uh so it's neat you know what it's a part of gaming's history even the not so pretty stuff deserves to be preserved so that we can learn never to do it again I'm just kidding

1456
02:14:23,499 --> 02:14:28,864
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, some games that are coming out very soon.

1457
02:14:28,904 --> 02:14:29,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1458
02:14:30,566 --> 02:14:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so this week we've got, let's see, Battlefield Waltz on Nintendo Switch, Ixion on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1459
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:47,761
[SPEAKER_08]: South of Midnight on PC and Xbox Series.

1460
02:14:47,821 --> 02:14:49,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a lot of people talking about that one.

1461
02:14:49,641 --> 02:14:50,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see that one.

1462
02:14:50,382 --> 02:14:51,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one looks pretty good.

1463
02:14:52,803 --> 02:14:57,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Commando's Origins on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.

1464
02:14:58,447 --> 02:15:02,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Descendants Next, or I'm sorry, Descenders Next.

1465
02:15:02,708 --> 02:15:07,489
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox One and Xbox Series.

1466
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:10,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see.

1489
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:47,852
[SPEAKER_05]: 4 because a lot of you in chat have been losing your minds over it.

1490
02:17:48,192 --> 02:17:55,457
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've also actually I played both Tetris Connected and some other Tetris game that played on a PlayStation 5 this week because those are fun multiplayer.

1491
02:17:55,497 --> 02:17:58,940

1492
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:04,003

1516
02:21:04,061 --> 02:21:07,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, not a good one, but an important one to talk about.

1517
02:21:07,223 --> 02:21:07,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1518
02:21:09,184 --> 02:21:17,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we have word that Bill Petras, who was a veteran Blizzard Entertainment employee, has passed away.

1519
02:21:18,308 --> 02:21:23,771
[SPEAKER_08]: He spent 30 years in the gaming industry, starting off, you know, of course, he was

1520
02:21:25,244 --> 02:21:30,228
[SPEAKER_08]: In the gaming industry in the 90s, worked on games like Ripper, Star Crusade, and Blood Net.

1521
02:21:30,528 --> 02:21:41,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Joined Blizzard Entertainment to work on art with Storyboard 3D and Cinematic Art for StarCraft, as well as the art director for World of Warcraft.

1522
02:21:41,736 --> 02:21:47,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Later left and then came back to work on, of course, Overwatch as well.

1523
02:21:48,841 --> 02:21:49,021
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1524
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:51,900
[SPEAKER_08]: That is unfortunate.

1525
02:21:51,981 --> 02:21:54,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what he passed away from, but I guess it doesn't really matter.

1526
02:21:55,404 --> 02:21:59,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sometimes they keep that secret to the family and that's none of our business.

1527
02:22:00,268 --> 02:22:03,812
[SPEAKER_05]: But very sad, tragic loss there for a lot of big games.

1528
02:22:04,132 --> 02:22:04,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So, unfortunate.

1529
02:22:06,124 --> 02:22:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll try to move from that over to the listener roundtable.

1530
02:22:08,986 --> 02:22:11,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to invite your comments and things.

1534
02:22:22,475 --> 02:22:25,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We would love to get some emails that weren't spam once in a while.

1535
02:22:26,357 --> 02:22:30,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we have any tonight unless it changed in the last six hours.

1536
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:30,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1537
02:22:30,740 --> 02:22:32,020
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1538
02:22:58,288 --> 02:22:58,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1539
02:22:59,730 --> 02:23:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing it.

1540
02:23:02,553 --> 02:23:02,893
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1541
02:23:03,514 --> 02:23:05,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to... What?

1542
02:23:06,998 --> 02:23:07,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob!

1543
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:08,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Coffee.

1544
02:23:10,262 --> 02:23:10,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the thing.

1545
02:23:11,403 --> 02:23:12,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1546
02:23:12,785 --> 02:23:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a comment from... I'm going to horribly mispronounce this name, but it's Mate...

1547
02:23:19,625 --> 02:23:28,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick Z, I'm sorry if I'm Matrix, maybe Matrix, Matrix Z, I bet, is asking, wait, this is on YouTube as well.

1548
02:23:29,028 --> 02:23:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So this doesn't stream live to YouTube, but it will, our podcast, so we used to be on a thing called Google Podcasts, and they actually sunset that, and they just said, YouTube supports podcasting now, so you can upload your podcast to YouTube.

1549
02:23:44,893 --> 02:24:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: and so that's what we do we upload our podcast to YouTube so it isn't live on YouTube but you can get the audio podcast there at this time we do not have a video podcast archive there I'm not gonna say that's forever gonna be the case

1550
02:24:01,076 --> 02:24:03,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but for now, it's just the audio.

1551
02:24:03,698 --> 02:24:05,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Same as you would get on Spotify.

1552
02:24:05,479 --> 02:24:07,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Same as you would get on Apple Podcasts.

1553
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:11,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.

1554
02:24:12,122 --> 02:24:15,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So we focus on, you know, our discussions and audio first.

1555
02:24:15,764 --> 02:24:23,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's usually why the video is just a little bonus for those of you that take the extra step to join us live on Sunday night.

1556
02:24:24,109 --> 02:24:25,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, work.

1557
02:24:25,469 --> 02:24:25,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that.

1558
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:26,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby steps.

1559
02:24:26,810 --> 02:24:28,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when it comes to YouTube, yes.

1560
02:24:29,551 --> 02:24:29,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually,

1561
02:24:31,093 --> 02:24:45,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, now that you bring it up and we have a little bit more of an open segment, I remember years ago, Jason would take... Jason, our voiceover guy who works very hard behind the scenes with our show, would take these...

1562
02:24:46,016 --> 02:25:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: episodes and he would actually zhuzh them up a little bit for YouTube when we used to do segments like listless and a lot of the games we haven't done in a while we probably we really need to do one of those games it's been a while or like video game match game and some things we haven't done in a while which now if we would have to call that video game snatch game for more people to understand what it's a parody of but we used to do video game match game

1563
02:25:10,792 --> 02:25:12,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss doing that, Rob.

1564
02:25:12,834 --> 02:25:14,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss doing that.

1565
02:25:14,055 --> 02:25:15,957
[SPEAKER_05]: We should schedule one in the coming weeks.

1566
02:25:16,938 --> 02:25:20,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So Jason would actually have visuals up on screen that went with it and all that stuff.

1567
02:25:20,841 --> 02:25:21,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And he worked very hard.

1568
02:25:21,702 --> 02:25:25,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, it didn't get a lot of viewers on YouTube.

1569
02:25:26,486 --> 02:25:29,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it was kind of one of those, is the juice worth the squeeze?

1570
02:25:29,589 --> 02:25:30,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

1571
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:31,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1572
02:25:31,571 --> 02:25:32,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway.

1573
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:37,412
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always appreciate Jason's efforts of trying new things in that department and others.

1574
02:25:37,472 --> 02:25:43,396
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that Google has the whole automatic import, I don't have to do anything to put this podcast on YouTube.

1575
02:25:43,756 --> 02:25:46,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It automatically scrapes the feed and imports it and does all that stuff, which is great.

1576
02:25:47,138 --> 02:25:47,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1577
02:25:48,019 --> 02:25:49,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And nothing ventured, nothing gained.

1578
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:50,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1579
02:25:50,400 --> 02:25:52,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This could happen.

1580
02:25:53,743 --> 02:25:55,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, we should probably have more TikToks up.

1581
02:25:56,789 --> 02:25:57,189
[SPEAKER_05]: TikTok Singers

1582
02:26:19,471 --> 02:26:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron Ares, that trailer came out for that movie, right?

1583
02:26:23,133 --> 02:26:25,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of things I really like about this.

1584
02:26:25,875 --> 02:26:27,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to copy some of what I said in the TikTok.

1585
02:26:28,677 --> 02:26:30,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Nine Inch Nails doing the soundtrack.

1586
02:26:30,498 --> 02:26:32,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, you're never going to be Daft Punk.

1587
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You're never going to be Wendy Carlos.

1588
02:26:35,342 --> 02:26:37,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nine Inch Nails is doing their own thing with it.

1589
02:26:37,463 --> 02:26:38,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, okay.

1590
02:26:38,904 --> 02:26:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I accept this.

1591
02:26:41,005 --> 02:26:42,927
[SPEAKER_05]: This sounds like it's going to be pretty good.

1592
02:26:42,947 --> 02:26:43,787
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a banger.

1593
02:26:45,128 --> 02:26:46,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Gillian Anderson being in the movie.

1594
02:26:47,730 --> 02:26:49,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at her and I go,

1595
02:26:50,311 --> 02:26:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm bisexual.

1596
02:26:53,293 --> 02:26:54,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's a wonderful actress.

1597
02:26:55,093 --> 02:26:56,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited that she's in it.

1598
02:26:57,735 --> 02:26:59,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of things to get excited about.

1599
02:26:59,555 --> 02:27:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, Jared Leto's involved.

1600
02:27:04,377 --> 02:27:05,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even mad about him.

1601
02:27:06,138 --> 02:27:06,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not mad about him.

1602
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,061
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not going to always be in bad movies.

1603
02:27:10,581 --> 02:27:11,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't like him.

1604
02:27:16,025 --> 02:27:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's commenting on my TikTok going, you know, they wouldn't have made the movie if it wasn't for him.

1605
02:27:21,849 --> 02:27:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he's an executive producer.

1606
02:27:23,331 --> 02:27:24,631
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my opinion!

1607
02:27:29,468 --> 02:27:30,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like him.

1608
02:27:30,869 --> 02:27:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know though.

1609
02:27:31,669 --> 02:27:44,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just me or I just had like this mental traumatic backlash to seeing a giant pixel Pac-Man going across the screen when I was seeing light cycles and recognizers in the real world.

1610
02:27:47,679 --> 02:27:49,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having to do this in chat right now.

1611
02:27:51,536 --> 02:27:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first things that Bobby said was, isn't Jared Leto the only reason the movie is even happening?

1612
02:27:58,143 --> 02:28:01,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to do a slap with a large trout to throw back to the MIRC days.

1613
02:28:06,009 --> 02:28:11,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello to Jay Helinski in chat who says his music is okay, but I can't stand anything he does otherwise.

1614
02:28:11,771 --> 02:28:20,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I associate his music with like a certain type of 2004 era emo that I can't say I've heard his music in many, many, many years.

1615
02:28:20,255 --> 02:28:23,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Further down the spiral is the album that got me through college the first time.

1616
02:28:23,776 --> 02:28:28,298
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I'm not talking about I think I believe the comments about Jared Leto, not Nine Inch Nails.

1617
02:28:28,318 --> 02:28:28,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?

1618
02:28:30,219 --> 02:28:32,180
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the singer of 36 Seconds to Mars, right?

1619
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I mixing them up with somebody else?

1620
02:28:35,701 --> 02:28:36,541
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, you're not.

1621
02:28:36,861 --> 02:28:37,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

1622
02:28:37,762 --> 02:28:41,583
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Nine Inch Nails is... Oh, God, Nine Inch Nails has always been fucking fantastic.

1623
02:28:41,623 --> 02:28:44,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why are you saying things about Nine Inch Nails?

1624
02:28:44,445 --> 02:28:44,645
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1625
02:28:44,805 --> 02:28:49,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, same girl, like the Downward Spiral was my goth album.

1626
02:28:50,207 --> 02:28:50,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Loved it.

1627
02:28:51,907 --> 02:28:55,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I never listened to 30 Seconds to Mars, like, ever.

1628
02:28:56,829 --> 02:28:58,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the premise of the movie.

1629
02:28:59,130 --> 02:29:00,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just worried.

1630
02:29:01,144 --> 02:29:01,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll still go see it.

1631
02:29:01,984 --> 02:29:03,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, whatever.

1632
02:29:03,405 --> 02:29:04,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's not kid ourselves.

1633
02:29:06,105 --> 02:29:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, there's a fucking machine right there in my background.

1634
02:29:09,587 --> 02:29:13,128
[SPEAKER_05]: For those watching live on Twitch, for those on the podcast feed, I'm sure you've seen a picture at some point.

1635
02:29:14,108 --> 02:29:19,629
[SPEAKER_05]: As a Tron fan, as someone who wants this franchise to succeed, I'm going to fucking see it.

1636
02:29:20,210 --> 02:29:22,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also going to voice my concerns.

1637
02:29:23,311 --> 02:29:24,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the latest box set.

1638
02:29:25,992 --> 02:29:26,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Legacy.

1639
02:29:26,952 --> 02:29:30,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That still is perfectly functional.

1640
02:29:31,196 --> 02:29:36,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in the fucking TikTok comments dared to call Tron Legacy a mid-movie.

1641
02:29:37,041 --> 02:29:40,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you people say anything on the internet and not get punished for it.

1642
02:29:40,764 --> 02:29:44,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, compared to the original Tron... Sue that person for defamation.

1643
02:29:45,968 --> 02:29:47,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to the original Tron...

1644
02:29:50,114 --> 02:29:50,815
[SPEAKER_05]: They're different.

1645
02:29:51,115 --> 02:29:51,836
[SPEAKER_05]: They're different.

1646
02:29:52,116 --> 02:29:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Tron is my favorite Disney movie.

1647
02:29:54,038 --> 02:29:54,618
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I get it.

1648
02:29:54,718 --> 02:29:55,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1649
02:29:56,540 --> 02:29:57,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little concerned.

1650
02:29:57,781 --> 02:30:03,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say now that the comment that made me chuckle was with all the Tron stuff in the real world.

1651
02:30:03,107 --> 02:30:06,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had commented, isn't this just the plot of the movie Pixels?

1652
02:30:06,850 --> 02:30:07,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1653
02:30:07,887 --> 02:30:08,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And that made me laugh.

1654
02:30:08,868 --> 02:30:11,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you not hear me say the comment about the giant Pac-Man?

1655
02:30:11,731 --> 02:30:12,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1656
02:30:13,032 --> 02:30:19,979
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am a little concerned about that, but we'll see how it turns out.

1657
02:30:21,181 --> 02:30:21,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1658
02:30:22,702 --> 02:30:25,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's true.

1659
02:30:25,585 --> 02:30:28,288
[SPEAKER_05]: S2100Matt says, we'll go to Disney to buy the Ares merch.

1660
02:30:28,388 --> 02:30:29,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I still need to go on that ride.

1661
02:30:30,330 --> 02:30:30,970
[SPEAKER_05]: in Orlando.

1662
02:30:32,151 --> 02:30:36,254
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have it in Anaheim, which is where I've been more often.

1663
02:30:36,334 --> 02:30:37,675
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a petition.

1664
02:30:37,715 --> 02:30:38,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they going to put it?

1665
02:30:38,755 --> 02:30:40,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone, go to change.org.

1666
02:30:42,308 --> 02:30:44,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, NoChange.org doesn't actually get anything done.

1667
02:30:46,472 --> 02:30:47,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they going to build it?

1668
02:30:47,733 --> 02:30:55,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's the rumors that they're going to tear down the thing next, or they're going to turn the Toy Story parking lot and where the P.F.

1669
02:30:55,339 --> 02:31:04,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Chang's is, that whole little block that Disney actually owns, that is going to become like a third property, but that's not going to happen for like 10 fucking years.

1670
02:31:05,588 --> 02:31:05,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Build up.

1671
02:31:06,629 --> 02:31:07,690
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to go to Orlando.

1672
02:31:08,991 --> 02:31:10,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Go from the PeopleMover and go up.

1673
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:16,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say, my Star Trek cruise next year goes out of Orlando.

1674
02:31:16,625 --> 02:31:25,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am absolutely, absolutely, absolutely considering either padding that time before or after with theme park time.

1675
02:31:25,792 --> 02:31:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Because not only do I want to do Disney, do you know what else I want to do?

1676
02:31:29,596 --> 02:31:30,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic Universe.

1677
02:31:30,356 --> 02:31:30,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Although...

1678
02:31:31,877 --> 02:31:37,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm concerned because I guess a big chunk of Epic Universe is Harry Potter, which in the year 2025, can you imagine?

1679
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:42,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Nintendo Land there is apparently twice as big as the one in L.A.

1680
02:31:42,682 --> 02:31:43,763
[SPEAKER_05]: and has the Donkey Kong ride.

1681
02:31:46,444 --> 02:31:46,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1682
02:31:47,824 --> 02:31:48,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's true.

1683
02:31:48,325 --> 02:31:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby says, so only do a half day at Epic Universe or as I understand, three fourths of a day because it's the Harry Potter stuff is a quarter of the park.

1684
02:31:55,208 --> 02:31:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1685
02:31:56,669 --> 02:31:57,029
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1686
02:31:58,730 --> 02:31:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

1687
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:00,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1688
02:32:01,592 --> 02:32:07,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Jay Helinski in chat says, I'm looking forward to what ends up happening with Ingress after this divorce at Niantic.

1689
02:32:07,459 --> 02:32:08,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

1690
02:32:08,180 --> 02:32:12,085
[SPEAKER_05]: As somebody who's sunk a lot of hours into that game, I'm very curious.

1691
02:32:13,186 --> 02:32:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious if they do a new client at some point.

1692
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very curious to see how they continue to integrate that with Scanaverse and their real point about trying to get people to scan areas of interest.

1693
02:32:25,957 --> 02:32:31,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, overclocking portals, which is like using their portal scan technology, is a thing in Ingress.

1694
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:33,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I think barely any players are doing it.

1695
02:32:34,202 --> 02:32:35,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Barely anybody's actually doing it.

1696
02:32:35,963 --> 02:32:40,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if they're going to find ways to make the AR gaming more compelling.

1697
02:32:40,886 --> 02:32:45,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I feel like that's where Niantic eventually wants to be, is trying to make more of that like...

1698
02:32:46,585 --> 02:32:48,906
[SPEAKER_05]: world around you AR gaming more compelling.

1699
02:32:49,486 --> 02:32:49,986
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

1700
02:32:50,767 --> 02:32:56,109
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call on our Discord channel, and I want to get to that before we wrap up tonight over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1701
02:32:56,369 --> 02:33:00,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You can join the green room and you can give us a call just like this caller is right now.

1702
02:33:00,990 --> 02:33:02,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1703
02:33:02,211 --> 02:33:02,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1704
02:33:03,871 --> 02:33:04,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, everybody.

1705
02:33:05,623 --> 02:33:07,044
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one and only Ranma.

1706
02:33:07,164 --> 02:33:09,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't you just here last week?

1707
02:33:09,786 --> 02:33:11,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't you just here last week?

1708
02:33:12,007 --> 02:33:15,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir, you have used your once a month ticket.

1709
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:16,150
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

1710
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:17,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a delight to hear from you.

1711
02:33:17,391 --> 02:33:18,031
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Ranma?

1712
02:33:18,952 --> 02:33:20,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm doing good.

1713
02:33:20,393 --> 02:33:21,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came back from Baltimore.

1714
02:33:21,694 --> 02:33:22,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a grand old time.

1715
02:33:23,075 --> 02:33:23,795
[SPEAKER_05]: In Baltimore?

1716
02:33:25,536 --> 02:33:26,477
[SPEAKER_05]: What was going on?

1717
02:33:26,637 --> 02:33:28,258
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in Baltimore other than history?

1718
02:33:28,278 --> 02:33:29,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Two questions.

1719
02:33:29,459 --> 02:33:30,740
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you doing in Baltimore?

1720
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:35,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you sing the song Good Morning Baltimore from the musical Hairspray?

1721
02:33:36,838 --> 02:33:38,659
[SPEAKER_04]: One, I went there to visit friends.

1722
02:33:39,020 --> 02:33:41,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, I did not because I do not remember the words.

1723
02:33:41,802 --> 02:33:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you only need the chorus.

1724
02:33:43,003 --> 02:33:45,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, Baltimore.

1725
02:33:45,104 --> 02:33:45,625
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you need.

1726
02:33:46,565 --> 02:33:53,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I just want you to know the last time I saw Hairspray, Ricky Lake was in it and I think I was like... That's the only one that exists.

1727
02:33:53,991 --> 02:33:55,532
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not talk about John Travolta.

1728
02:33:56,112 --> 02:33:57,613
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't.

1729
02:33:57,633 --> 02:33:58,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I just make it up.

1730
02:33:59,014 --> 02:33:59,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1731
02:34:01,376 --> 02:34:04,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the Ricky Lake version didn't have the songs, so I get it.

1732
02:34:06,531 --> 02:34:08,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, what do you want to call in about tonight?

1733
02:34:09,152 --> 02:34:13,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to jump in on this whole switch to brouhaha, okay?

1734
02:34:13,853 --> 02:34:15,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Brouhaha is a good word for it.

1735
02:34:16,754 --> 02:34:20,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I def can verify this.

1736
02:34:20,815 --> 02:34:26,336
[SPEAKER_04]: When they announced all the games and they announced the price, I said, this is such bull.

1737
02:34:26,556 --> 02:34:29,757
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way that console is worth that price.

1738
02:34:31,116 --> 02:34:52,030
[SPEAKER_04]: and my reasoning is I'm a tech person I gotta see if the tech is worth the purchase I said for years the Switch is not worth the price mark because the hardware is underneath it but I also said when I do buy the Switch I'm walking out of the store with five games I walked out with six that day on Black Friday

1739
02:34:54,045 --> 02:35:00,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's something else people often forget about Nintendo, DJ Ranma S. Nintendo will not sell their consoles at a loss.

1740
02:35:01,349 --> 02:35:02,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Other gaming companies will do it.

1741
02:35:02,809 --> 02:35:04,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has sold at a loss.

1742
02:35:04,490 --> 02:35:05,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's done it.

1743
02:35:05,911 --> 02:35:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has never sold at a loss until the 3DS backed them into a corner and they had to because the 3DS was going to tank otherwise.

1744
02:35:13,654 --> 02:35:15,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that is, yeah, yeah.

1745
02:35:16,015 --> 02:35:19,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So them overcharging versus what the hardware really is

1746
02:35:20,177 --> 02:35:20,958
[SPEAKER_05]: is not a complete surprise.

1747
02:35:20,978 --> 02:35:23,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand why it frustrates people, but it's not.

1748
02:35:23,059 --> 02:35:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to me, the more glaring issue is the $350-ish Japanese-only one.

1749
02:35:32,125 --> 02:35:33,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get to that.

1750
02:35:33,406 --> 02:35:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1751
02:35:34,266 --> 02:35:35,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll shut my mouth.

1752
02:35:36,187 --> 02:35:37,108
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good, fam.

1753
02:35:37,568 --> 02:35:43,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I read an NVIDIA blog post about the Switch 2, about the hardware that's underneath.

1754
02:35:44,433 --> 02:35:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I cross-referenced what I read

1755
02:35:46,863 --> 02:35:49,605
[SPEAKER_04]: on a Wikipedia entry about the different Tegra processors.

1756
02:35:49,825 --> 02:35:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at them like, you know what?

1757
02:35:53,949 --> 02:35:55,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why they're asking that much.

1758
02:35:56,131 --> 02:36:00,294
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardware underneath in the console, I say, is well worth it.

1759
02:36:00,754 --> 02:36:04,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I said that night, I'm going to put the preorder down.

1760
02:36:05,058 --> 02:36:06,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that it was worth it.

1761
02:36:06,359 --> 02:36:06,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It was worth it.

1762
02:36:08,328 --> 02:36:13,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear about the tariffs, and again, you probably have seen this.

1763
02:36:13,295 --> 02:36:18,583
[SPEAKER_04]: The sheer number of people that are saying, oh, Nintendo is putting out this price to cover their artists.

1764
02:36:19,164 --> 02:36:20,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you ignorant...

1765
02:36:23,058 --> 02:36:25,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo made the announcement that day.

1766
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't realize what was going on.

1767
02:36:27,261 --> 02:36:28,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pure coincidence.

1768
02:36:29,063 --> 02:36:29,783
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it was.

1769
02:36:29,823 --> 02:36:31,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to explain this to people.

1770
02:36:32,085 --> 02:36:35,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And then here we come talking about the price of the video games.

1771
02:36:36,208 --> 02:36:40,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are talking about, oh, how Donkey Kong Country 2 was $89.99 in the U.S.

1772
02:36:40,672 --> 02:36:41,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was not.

1773
02:36:42,633 --> 02:36:45,115
[SPEAKER_04]: It was $59.99 U.S.

1774
02:36:45,476 --> 02:36:46,396
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know this?

1775
02:36:47,117 --> 02:36:47,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there.

1776
02:36:48,218 --> 02:36:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't speak the legend to me when I was there when it was written.

1777
02:36:52,125 --> 02:37:09,154
[SPEAKER_04]: and the thing is almost every site is talking about the price comparison of Super NES games and Switch 2 games are Canadian prices I was just about to say you gotta use your critical thinking because sometimes when people post those stuff it's showing what the Canadian flyers were in the day

1778
02:37:09,574 --> 02:37:13,397
[SPEAKER_05]: which was back in that day.

1779
02:37:13,417 --> 02:37:14,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's gone back and forth and all that.

1780
02:37:15,498 --> 02:37:16,459
[SPEAKER_05]: The dollars are volatile.

1781
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:23,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But in that day, you would generally expect to see $10 to $20 higher in Canada because of what the conversion was at that time.

1782
02:37:25,225 --> 02:37:31,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And what people don't understand is the reason why games went so cheap because CD and DVD format.

1783
02:37:31,830 --> 02:37:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You could buy spindles of blank media and put stuff on it.

1784
02:37:36,694 --> 02:37:37,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all over.

1785
02:37:37,595 --> 02:37:40,458
[SPEAKER_04]: That helped bring down the price of the games.

1786
02:37:40,798 --> 02:37:41,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was great.

1787
02:37:41,859 --> 02:37:45,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a golden age because almost everybody could afford to buy video games.

1788
02:37:46,263 --> 02:37:48,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the prices started to come up again.

1789
02:37:48,405 --> 02:37:49,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I understand.

1790
02:37:49,906 --> 02:37:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta pay for the servers.

1791
02:37:52,148 --> 02:37:53,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta pay for the tech.

1792
02:37:53,610 --> 02:37:54,430
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get that.

1793
02:37:54,931 --> 02:37:55,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

1794
02:37:56,712 --> 02:37:59,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's just asking a little bit too much money out of my pocket right now.

1795
02:37:59,955 --> 02:38:00,996
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I look at it.

1796
02:38:01,016 --> 02:38:04,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they have crossed the line on the pricing.

1797
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:12,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, as Mike has said in the chat, which is something I had said somewhere else on a Facebook group, when someone's talking about inflation...

1798
02:38:13,553 --> 02:38:18,095
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't compare inflation when people's salaries have not gone up.

1799
02:38:18,975 --> 02:38:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years ago, when the N64 came out, I didn't pay $199.

1800
02:38:23,998 --> 02:38:30,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I paid $249 because I went to a local mom and pop store that I have been loyal to for years.

1801
02:38:31,101 --> 02:38:34,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And I worked my ass off and paid that off.

1802
02:38:34,262 --> 02:38:35,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I did.

1803
02:38:36,543 --> 02:38:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, it's like, look at the price.

1804
02:38:40,285 --> 02:38:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say this right now.

1805
02:38:41,766 --> 02:38:42,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1806
02:38:43,075 --> 02:38:47,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I make about $80,000 in New York City.

1807
02:38:48,217 --> 02:38:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how long it took me to pay bills and to save up just to get a PlayStation 5?

1808
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:56,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and some people are going to say, wow, that's a lot of money.

1809
02:38:57,641 --> 02:39:02,404
[SPEAKER_05]: But for New York City, you're going to be on budget with that.

1810
02:39:02,604 --> 02:39:03,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1811
02:39:04,905 --> 02:39:06,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll say this right now.

1812
02:39:07,206 --> 02:39:08,406
[SPEAKER_04]: The Switch at that price?

1813
02:39:09,807 --> 02:39:10,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it.

1814
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:13,382
[SPEAKER_04]: After Taras, I can wait.

1815
02:39:13,843 --> 02:39:19,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I will pay off the rest of my bills first, and then when the time comes, I will make that purchase.

1816
02:39:19,829 --> 02:39:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, you can't see it, but behind me, on the right, is a shelf full of PlayStation 4.

1817
02:39:26,476 --> 02:39:32,804
[SPEAKER_04]: for PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series games I have yet to play because I caught them on sale.

1818
02:39:32,844 --> 02:39:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, if I don't buy it now, I'm probably not going to get my hands on it because believe you me, that Cyberpunk 2077 fire sale for $10?

1819
02:39:39,513 --> 02:39:40,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was in on that shit.

1820
02:39:46,490 --> 02:40:11,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the dam that's going to burst is that Nintendo is going to have to re-approach their concept of never putting games on sale I do think there's going to be a lot of gamers that respond similarly to what Loki and I are saying that we're not going to risk $80 on a game we don't know enough about to buy that on day one To be fair, Nintendo has put games on sale

1821
02:40:13,084 --> 02:40:13,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Rarely.

1822
02:40:14,685 --> 02:40:16,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's never the ones you want.

1823
02:40:17,646 --> 02:40:18,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinda.

1824
02:40:18,287 --> 02:40:21,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Player's Choice or Greatest Hits?

1825
02:40:21,248 --> 02:40:26,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the same game with a fancy new banner around the old cover art and it was $39.99.

1826
02:40:27,291 --> 02:40:30,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, and Sony did the same thing for Greatest Hits and da-da-da.

1827
02:40:30,613 --> 02:40:31,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I gotcha.

1828
02:40:32,134 --> 02:40:36,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't notice since PlayStation 4 nobody's done that.

1829
02:40:37,475 --> 02:40:40,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else is interesting?

1830
02:40:41,038 --> 02:40:43,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the digital fire sales now.

1831
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:51,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out Sony's digital store any day of the week and you can find some relatively recent games for $20, but it's all the stuff that flopped at $70.

1832
02:40:53,628 --> 02:40:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange right in chat says, I'm definitely not planning on canceling my Gamefly anytime soon.

1833
02:40:57,851 --> 02:40:58,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1834
02:40:58,152 --> 02:41:00,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm almost positive I saw Bobby say a similar thing.

1835
02:41:00,834 --> 02:41:06,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how that's going to... I wonder if suddenly Gamefly is really popular again.

1836
02:41:09,034 --> 02:41:11,075
[SPEAKER_05]: or similar services.

1837
02:41:11,776 --> 02:41:24,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this goes back to what I talked about last week about renting those games at the local video store because I couldn't afford them but I did have that chance to play the game for three nights and three days and two nights and take a look at how great it was.

1838
02:41:25,085 --> 02:41:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine the $80 price of games bringing back game rentals in a way we haven't seen in decades?

1839
02:41:35,001 --> 02:41:36,022
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be crazy.

1840
02:41:36,042 --> 02:41:44,509
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that I'm sitting here, I'm like, hell yeah, I would rent the Donkey Kong game for like 10 bucks and play it for a little bit and try it out.

1841
02:41:44,569 --> 02:41:45,770
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'll fight against it.

1842
02:41:47,011 --> 02:41:56,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just say that somehow rentals come back in the next two years and we have blockbuster videos or whatever the equivalent would be now with that, where they're renting video games.

1843
02:41:56,719 --> 02:41:59,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Publishers would just be like, hey, consumers.

1844
02:42:00,902 --> 02:42:27,210
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're gonna like put some stupid like a code or something like that because I mean remember they were combating like used game sales at one time they were combating rentals you literally cannot trust this game industry for anything like it's just Bobby with sorry Bobby with an excellent reminder you know libraries also lend games that's a damn good point I always forget well right now while they have the budget I mean I'm looking

1845
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:28,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you an example.

1846
02:42:30,011 --> 02:42:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: When I bought my PlayStation 4, I bought the Spider-Man 2 edition one, and I sold the Spider-Man game because it's not my cup of tea.

1847
02:42:36,913 --> 02:42:40,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my friends said I was crazy, but I'm like, I have a very eclectic taste in video games.

1848
02:42:40,975 --> 02:42:42,435
[SPEAKER_04]: If you saw my collection, you'd understand it.

1849
02:42:42,915 --> 02:42:49,658
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go to GameStop, and I trade it in for another game that they have brand new, and the guy's like, it's not my cup of tea.

1850
02:42:49,698 --> 02:42:53,119
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, what you should do is go ahead, play through the game,

1851
02:42:53,948 --> 02:42:57,651
[SPEAKER_04]: return, sell it back, pick up another game, and go back and forth.

1852
02:42:57,692 --> 02:42:58,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this all the time.

1853
02:42:59,053 --> 02:42:59,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1854
02:42:59,553 --> 02:43:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I like to cheat the system, even I have my moral standards.

1855
02:43:04,698 --> 02:43:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1856
02:43:08,001 --> 02:43:08,261
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1857
02:43:09,142 --> 02:43:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are starting to run long for the show, so I do want to get any last thoughts for you, and then we're going to wrap up tonight.

1858
02:43:14,967 --> 02:43:17,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ranma, anything else you want to get out before we get out?

1859
02:43:19,853 --> 02:43:30,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Next time we do a world release date, if the title kind of sounds like this is a fucking anime, 99% of the time, it generally is.

1860
02:43:31,817 --> 02:43:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1861
02:43:32,317 --> 02:43:36,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will probably be like, oh, I've heard of this one, oh, I haven't played it yet, and so forth.

1862
02:43:36,839 --> 02:43:44,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would know more animes if I listened every week to Anime Jam Session, although I do try to make it a point to tune in, but sometimes the talk's a little over my head.

1863
02:43:44,421 --> 02:43:46,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually starting an anime.

1864
02:43:47,512 --> 02:43:51,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to watch Tokyo Ghoul since we got the character in Dead by Daylight.

1865
02:43:51,273 --> 02:43:52,253
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1866
02:43:52,533 --> 02:43:54,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And for you, Rob, I recommend watching Cowboy Bebop.

1867
02:43:54,914 --> 02:43:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You love it.

1868
02:43:55,874 --> 02:43:56,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah.

1869
02:43:56,534 --> 02:43:57,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch Sakamoto Days.

1870
02:43:58,474 --> 02:43:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1871
02:43:59,055 --> 02:43:59,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1872
02:44:00,235 --> 02:44:00,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1873
02:44:01,055 --> 02:44:02,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost got the cosplay for that.

1874
02:44:02,835 --> 02:44:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost did.

1875
02:44:03,596 --> 02:44:04,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost pulled the trigger on it.

1876
02:44:04,996 --> 02:44:07,336
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so fucking good.

1877
02:44:07,376 --> 02:44:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: My husband would prefer I watch Sailor Moon, but okay.

1878
02:44:13,038 --> 02:44:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, if you still have a functional DVD player, I have an entire box set of Cowboy Bebop.

1879
02:44:17,340 --> 02:44:18,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Wii.

1880
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:19,400
[SPEAKER_05]: They play DVDs.

1881
02:44:21,141 --> 02:44:24,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Ranma, my friend, I'm going to let you go, but have fun on Anime Jam Session.

1882
02:44:24,443 --> 02:44:25,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We will talk to you very soon.

1883
02:44:26,443 --> 02:44:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, take care, y'all.

1884
02:44:27,404 --> 02:44:27,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye!

1885
02:44:29,265 --> 02:44:32,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, with that, quickly, Loki, do we have any last-minute stories tonight?

1886
02:44:33,886 --> 02:44:34,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1887
02:44:34,827 --> 02:44:36,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unfortunately we do.

1888
02:44:36,708 --> 02:44:38,588
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got word that...

1889
02:44:40,950 --> 02:44:42,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Poor, poor Bellaltro.

1890
02:44:43,131 --> 02:44:44,812
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't get a break.

1891
02:44:44,832 --> 02:44:54,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So you remember they were getting age-restricted on some of the storefronts because of gambling concerns or whatever, and then that kind of got ironed out.

1892
02:44:55,257 --> 02:45:05,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now, good old YouTube and their changing of their terms of service are now cracking down on depictions or promotions of online casino sites or apps.

1893
02:45:06,403 --> 02:45:08,626
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll cause your stuff to be age-restricted.

1894
02:45:08,666 --> 02:45:15,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, they're false-flagging the Bellatro content because it has poker mechanics, but it's not necessarily gambling.

1895
02:45:15,132 --> 02:45:19,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will fucking bet, dimed a dollar, it's a fucking AI thing that's false-flagging it.

1896
02:45:19,857 --> 02:45:20,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1897
02:45:21,010 --> 02:45:49,208
[SPEAKER_08]: of course, so unfortunately it's an issue right now local thunk, the creator of the game said on social media good thing we're protecting children from knowing what a four of a kind is and letting them watch CSGO case opening videos instead I mean, because that's not being struck down by this thing, so yeah, it's frustrating to say the least alright, anything else?

1898
02:45:51,065 --> 02:46:02,970
[SPEAKER_08]: um I just to mention you was it I think we talked about it before Minecraft movie 157 million dollars in the box office opening uh record-breaking beating out Mario Brothers congratulations

1899
02:46:04,124 --> 02:46:04,424
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1900
02:46:04,924 --> 02:46:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get to final thoughts real quick.

1901
02:46:06,464 --> 02:46:08,505

1907
02:46:24,568 --> 02:46:32,390
[SPEAKER_05]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, wherever you found this show.

1908
02:46:32,910 --> 02:46:34,911
[SPEAKER_05]: goes an awful long way and thank you very much.

1909
02:46:35,271 --> 02:46:36,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a breath, Rob.

1910
02:46:36,392 --> 02:46:36,932
I can't.

1911
02:46:36,952 --> 02:46:38,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get it done.

1912
02:46:38,373 --> 02:46:39,513
[SPEAKER_02]: You are speeding.

1913
02:46:39,953 --> 02:46:41,754
[SPEAKER_05]: You know me.

1914
02:46:42,215 --> 02:46:44,256
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's not micromachines, it's not the real thing.

1915
02:46:45,576 --> 02:46:46,197
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to stream tonight?

1918
02:46:50,459 --> 02:46:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I won't have a lot of time for it, but I'll do some killer matches tonight.

1919
02:46:55,101 --> 02:46:56,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get a little bit in.

1920
02:46:56,281 --> 02:46:57,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'll do it.

1921
02:46:57,462 --> 02:46:59,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of already logged in.

1922
02:47:00,003 --> 02:47:01,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Final thoughts for our listeners.

1923
02:47:02,505 --> 02:47:05,366
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought is no one will replace the pig in my heart.

1924
02:47:06,546 --> 02:47:06,866
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1925
02:47:07,306 --> 02:47:07,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good stream.

1926
02:47:07,847 --> 02:47:08,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in a minute.

1927
02:47:09,647 --> 02:47:10,908
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

1928
02:47:10,968 --> 02:47:11,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, that takes us to you.

1929
02:47:12,008 --> 02:47:12,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Your final thought tonight.

1930
02:47:14,789 --> 02:47:18,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Final thought is work tomorrow.

1931
02:47:21,430 --> 02:47:23,571
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I don't want to hear the news this week.

1932
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:25,212
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only going to get worse.

1933
02:47:25,292 --> 02:47:26,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I know, but...

1934
02:47:28,018 --> 02:47:30,699
[SPEAKER_05]: All those checks and balances that refuse to check and balance...

1935
02:47:48,442 --> 02:47:49,082
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1936
02:48:08,871 --> 02:48:24,098
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to give a shout out to my pals over at the show Video Game Realness, which stars four wonderful guys out of Canada that do this show, including a buddy and a longtime supporter of this show, Delvin, who has been on the show at some point.

1937
02:48:24,138 --> 02:48:26,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he was here in person like years ago before the pandemic.

1938
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:28,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out the show.

1939
02:48:28,420 --> 02:48:29,501
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on YouTube now.

1940
02:48:29,541 --> 02:48:31,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're actually doing like a YouTube show.

1941
02:48:31,682 --> 02:48:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just came back with their Switch 2 reaction show.

1942
02:48:35,424 --> 02:48:36,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

1943
02:48:36,264 --> 02:48:37,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And my understanding is...

1944
02:48:38,405 --> 02:48:41,246
[SPEAKER_05]: They may not be the only ones staging a comeback.

1945
02:48:41,687 --> 02:48:45,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like 2014 in the podcast-iverse right now.

1946
02:48:45,568 --> 02:48:46,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And it feels great.

1947
02:48:47,309 --> 02:48:48,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So check out my pals over there, won't you?

1948
02:48:50,151 --> 02:48:50,491
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1949
02:48:50,531 --> 02:48:51,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for me.

1950
02:48:51,371 --> 02:48:52,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

1951
02:48:52,272 --> 02:48:53,492
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you in seven days.

1952
02:48:54,253 --> 02:48:56,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And who knows what's going to get fucked by then.

1953
02:48:56,374 --> 02:48:57,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's stay.

1954
02:48:58,495 --> 02:49:00,035
[SPEAKER_05]: The possibilities are endless.

1955
02:49:00,055 --> 02:49:01,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay positive.

1956
02:49:03,937 --> 02:49:04,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.

1957
02:49:04,958 --> 02:49:05,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
