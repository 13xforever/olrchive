1
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:11,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't work at Rockstar, I don't know the answer, but I do know what happened.

2
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:39,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you the new release date you might already know and the rest of the week's gaming news.

3
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:42,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

5
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:50,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:50,238 --> 00:01:02,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1045 of our program for today, May the 4th, 2025.

7
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, may the 4th be with you, yada, yada, et cetera, et cetera.

8
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:09,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have Star Trek to talk about tonight, so y'all are just going to have to deal.

9
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:10,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get into that later.

10
00:01:11,324 --> 00:01:12,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they want to...

11
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:14,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they want to talk about Star Wars.

12
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:16,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:17,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Hiss.

14
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:18,809
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

15
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not a Trek fan?

16
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Hiss.

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:20,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Hiss back.

18
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say I wasn't.

19
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:26,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the, oh, you like pancakes, so you must not like waffles.

20
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,317
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you can like both.

21
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:30,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be either or.

22
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You can like both.

23
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You can like both.

24
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Trek a little more, but I appreciate both.

25
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's fine.

26
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,365
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, it doesn't matter to me what other people like.

27
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,305
[SPEAKER_01]: It only matters what I like.

28
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

29
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:45,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Snarky.

30
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell.

31
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:50,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a mood, okay?

32
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:51,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a mood.

33
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:54,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we ever have any other Jamie here on this program?

34
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:55,798
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

35
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,219
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm in a super mood.

36
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like a super mood, but a super mood.

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the super snark-tendo.

38
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

39
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:07,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just had a day of it.

40
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in the point where I am sick of shit.

41
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we at the detox meme?

42
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it officially.

43
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:14,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we there?

44
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I spread La Mer on my toast, I'm sure, bitch.

45
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:20,289
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see what kind of mood he's in.

47
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:23,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

48
00:02:23,473 --> 00:02:24,074
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

49
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:25,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Is tired a mood?

50
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

51
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:28,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I am right now.

52
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely tired is a mood.

53
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:30,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been tired.

54
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I will settle with tired.

55
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:32,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it works.

56
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving the Mario Kart playing behind you tonight.

57
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Which Mario Kart is that?

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's modded Mario Kart.

59
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

60
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:39,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, which one is that?

61
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:40,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the Wii one?

62
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,113
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks better.

63
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:42,975
[SPEAKER_03]: What is what is Mario Kart?

64
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:47,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We Mario Kart Wii Deluxe with like several hundred tracks.

65
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, several hundred tracks.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing what those modders do.

67
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just giggling because the name's very funny, but that's really impressive.

68
00:02:57,103 --> 00:03:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, modders, even though that's certainly a legal gray area.

69
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:04,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But come on, all of those people are going to buy Mario Kart World 80 bucks or not.

70
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,848
[SPEAKER_03]: All those people, it's just pouring into the Mario Kart fandom, right?

71
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:09,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

72
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play Mario Kart less than 24 hours ago.

73
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at Super Nintendo World.

74
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:19,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, very, very last minute decision.

75
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:25,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the last like four weeks, I decided I was going to go see Kylie Minow a second time.

76
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:27,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan was in on the plan.

77
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:36,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, you know what, we're going to go see our Star Trek cruise friend, Sean, who is out here from the Midwest, who was going to go see the Kylie show in LA.

78
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:37,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, you know what?

79
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to get tickets, and they weren't overpriced.

80
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,379
[SPEAKER_03]: They were reasonable.

81
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We were like, you know what?

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just fucking go.

83
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on a road trip.

84
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go see Kylie a second time.

85
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:57,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually follow a lot of concerts to see them multiple times, but for Kylie, who I've actually never seen live before this, but have liked for a long time, it was worth it.

86
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,710
[SPEAKER_03]: But we made a very last-minute decision within the last week.

87
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:05,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we were doing the last OLR, I did not know I would be talking about Super Nintendo World tonight.

88
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the last week, we decided...

89
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:23,045
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as long as we're in L.A., Universal's got this thing going on right now called Fan Nights, which is kind of, in a way, it's their answer to Disney and all the special nights that they do, but also Universal's had the Horror Nights for some time.

90
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:28,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is them trying to find ways to do that at different times of the year to try to bring in those nighttime dollars.

91
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were able to go to the park at 7 p.m.,

92
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We stayed until about midnight.

93
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:38,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, they were open until 2 a.m., but I can't imagine going that late.

94
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everything was open past 10 p.m.

95
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:42,014
[SPEAKER_03]: or 11 p.m.

96
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Some rides closed early.

97
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:48,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to do the Mario Kart ride before I think 10.30 was when it closed.

98
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to go on Nintendo World.

99
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:51,357
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to do it.

100
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:53,818
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was fine.

101
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really neat sort of experience.

102
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,560
[SPEAKER_03]: The ride queue is very impressive.

103
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:02,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything in Nintendo World is just really impressive to behold.

104
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:07,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The ride itself though, I just didn't love the creative direction they went with it.

105
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:07,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be honest.

106
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:11,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like the whole VR, like it wasn't even VR.

107
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:19,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like you put this headset on with goggles, but when I say goggles, I mean like a plastic visor that hangs over your head.

108
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming the visor is actually some sort of projector with the image.

109
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming that's somehow how the magic works, that sort of thing.

110
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:34,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you look around, you see Mario Carters going all around you and you can actually look down at your wheel and you see how many coins and shells that you have.

111
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:53,264
[SPEAKER_03]: and so the game is that you're supposed to hit the Bowser and the Koopa kids with golden shells and you're supposed to not hit Mario and Princess and all the Mario team people and when it says turn left and right you're supposed to follow that and that's how you get coins and you're supposed to get like so much I

112
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to give...

113
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:58,286
[SPEAKER_03]: so like you know they got some really interesting concepts I just didn't like again I found the hologram thing to be very distracting because it was all nonsensical it didn't really line up with the black light ride that you were going through and I felt like my visor was off because you aim by looking which is the worst aiming system ever because if the thing is slightly off then the shell is just going to go wherever it wants and so it wasn't like you know

115
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:07,088
[SPEAKER_05]: 10, 20 year ago VR tech that they're implementing there, you know, Oculus DK2 type tech.

116
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:07,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

117
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:11,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So the interesting thing was there were three of us in the car.

118
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,650
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's actually five of us at the park, but they put three of us in one car and two of us in the other.

119
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they put a single rider next to us.

120
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the single rider we got was Big Gamer.

121
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,215
[SPEAKER_03]: He was Big Gamer.

122
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:23,676
[SPEAKER_03]: He rode this ride all the time.

123
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:27,579
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like trying to tell us what to aim for and stuff and where to get the big points.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I don't expect that this person knows who I am, nor do I expect that having a 23-year-old podcast necessarily makes me the world best gamer.

125
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: But it did take a little something out of like, I just want to experience this, bro.

126
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:42,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have told him.

127
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:44,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I would have just told him.

128
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:48,644
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably should have, but, you know, it's just one of those things.

129
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:49,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

130
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:49,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

131
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:50,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

132
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:50,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a mood.

133
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:51,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, I'm in a mood.

134
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be honest.

135
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:57,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Toy Story's Midway Mania was a more fun game.

136
00:07:58,887 --> 00:08:04,109
[SPEAKER_03]: I do still think the Mario Kart ride, if you're a Nintendo fan, is worth doing once in your life.

137
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:08,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really impressive and just the queue is incredible and everything is great.

138
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it, for me, has the same replayability that Midway Mania has.

139
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:19,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite honestly, I would want to ride the ride once and just ignore the game.

140
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what I'm going to do next time.

141
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:47,226
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's annoying about it is that they have like VR I don't remember which park has it or maybe it's an attraction or something in Japan but they have VR versions of Mario Kart that are full VR that you just sit in like a little, basically sit in a racing chair and you play the game and that looks like a lot more fun than that ride so it's just weird to see them outdone

142
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,249
[SPEAKER_05]: years prior.

143
00:08:50,350 --> 00:09:00,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

144
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:04,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And Fifth Dream in chat says, sounds like a hygiene issue.

145
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I wouldn't want to wear something hundreds of people already have.

146
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:10,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do the same collection of the goggles thing.

147
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's paralyzed.

148
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Disney does.

149
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they steam sterilize it or something.

150
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the system is, but it's a similar collection to what they do at Midway Mania.

151
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't you think you'd sterilize it though?

152
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe if you don't realize that, yes, they collect the visors and put them in the thing.

153
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a thing.

154
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:33,933
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I'm aware, that's actually an operational requirement for rides like that.

155
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it has to be.

156
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:40,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the magic is, but it's whatever Disney's doing, they're doing in that regard.

157
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:42,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

158
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:47,440
[SPEAKER_03]: QuestBuster says, the Mario Kart ride sounds like a cool concept to try out at least once.

159
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, and I'm not going to sit here and lie and say, oh, it was bad.

160
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,121
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was really neat.

161
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:56,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't care for the game thrown into the Blacklight ride.

162
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:59,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of just wish they'd lean into one lane or the other.

163
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to sit here and say it sucked.

164
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really cool.

165
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You should do it once in your life.

166
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:10,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of how I feel about Nintendo World as well, is that for me, Nintendo World was just...

167
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:12,566
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

168
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:32,657
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

169
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

170
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:56,984
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

171
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,406
[SPEAKER_03]: and there was all sorts of things you could get.

172
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:21,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They had salads and healthier choices too, if that's what you really wanted.

173
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:27,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you wanted really unhealthy shit, they had full-on shakes that were green and themed.

174
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was cute, but apparently it's extremely popular.

175
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to get a reservation at 10.15 at night to go there.

176
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

177
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I ate very late last night, but as far as theme park dining goes, it's hard to touch Disney.

178
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:47,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no Carthay Circle, but it was nice.

179
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:51,286
[SPEAKER_03]: For that kind of food, I'm, dare I say, reasonably priced.

180
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:57,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan took a screen cap and put it on his blue sky, and one of our friends replied, Mama, that's just Seattle prices.

181
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was funny.

182
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I was expecting worse.

183
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:05,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was fine.

184
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:07,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was cool.

185
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:11,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did some other standard Universal things, but they do have some other special things.

186
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:17,677
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I quickly just mention, and Jamie will love this because I'm going to bring up Star Trek, but it might surprise you.

187
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the other limited things they have there is Star Trek Red Alert, where they actually have set pieces from the Enterprise D that they used in Star Trek Picard that they have on display.

188
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:31,902
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of just having them on display where you can walk in and see them, they

189
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this whole like experience type thing, like think the Star Trek Vegas ride, but way worse because it's temporary.

190
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:54,788
[SPEAKER_03]: The actors are doing their best with kind of a subpar script that is a plot to move you from room to room to see things where, of course, the final room is the actual bridge that you can see that stuff.

191
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:55,068
[SPEAKER_03]: But

192
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be real.

193
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:59,830
[SPEAKER_03]: As a Star Trek fan, I found it kind of bad.

194
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:00,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't care for it.

195
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:03,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I really just wish it was an open museum.

196
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have just gone in and seen the set pieces.

197
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just be the Star Trek experience.

198
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:09,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

199
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,999
[SPEAKER_03]: The actors were very much just wearing cosplay costumes from Bot Online.

200
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,941
[SPEAKER_03]: The script was mediocre at best.

201
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:22,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think some of them were probably having to read off teleprompters.

202
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

203
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:26,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I will say there was a half Klingon and she looked fierce.

204
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:28,165
[SPEAKER_03]: She looked amazing.

205
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:29,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the makeup was really good.

206
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give it that.

207
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:46,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kind of... When you're in the bridge room and they're acting out the final season, if you look up, there's a giant hole in the ceiling where you can see the entire studio rig of the studio that they borrowed to do this limited edition thing.

208
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:48,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really takes you out of the experience.

209
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just...

210
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was just, like, it's only a three-week event they're doing, this FanFest thing.

211
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's why, like, it just, it felt temporary.

212
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem with it.

213
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:00,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt temporary.

214
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,085
[SPEAKER_01]: You should leave feedback on it.

215
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough...

216
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:04,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

217
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:04,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

218
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:40,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Disney Disney Disney Disney

220
00:15:02,598 --> 00:15:31,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see them put a sense of permanency with Star Trek I don't know how that works because Star Trek is Paramount but Paramount is no longer in the theme park business as those of us that live in Northern California know because of what happened with Great America and now the fact that the Knott's people own it and every time I tell people did you know there's a Mass Effect ride at Great America people go either one of two things one what I didn't know there was a Mass Effect ride or two or two that's still there

221
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:34,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need to see that.

222
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got to go.

223
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:35,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

224
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We should go on a theme park day.

225
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:39,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun.

226
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to go.

227
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:41,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go again.

228
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say there was one other experience I'll mention quickly, and this is adjacent to gaming.

229
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They also had a Dungeons & Dragons walkthrough.

230
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:53,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure what... I mean, it was obviously supposed to be references to the movie, which I didn't see.

231
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:53,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

232
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:55,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got the game references.

233
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to see the movie!

234
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It is fantastic!

235
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the game references and everything.

236
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:01,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's mimics and shit.

237
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:04,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know enough from playing the games and any...

238
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:09,719
[SPEAKER_03]: JRPG or otherwise RPG in the last years of my life.

239
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I understood everything.

240
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:11,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the same thing.

241
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:12,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You were with actors.

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You were moving from room to room.

243
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think the D&D one was put together better.

244
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:17,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

245
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: It felt like they put more money into it because they built a whole animatronic beholder.

246
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,183
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you call the eyes with the Medusa things, right?

247
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:24,584
[SPEAKER_03]: A beholder.

248
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,765
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a big beholder at the end that looked really impressive.

249
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,125
[SPEAKER_03]: The actors were getting into the show.

250
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:34,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It was community theater, but it was cute.

251
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute.

252
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was better than the Star Trek one, to be quite honest.

253
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:40,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really surprised me because I'm a Trek fan.

254
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:43,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to D&D, I'm like, I haven't even seen the movie, but it was cute.

255
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:51,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So Phil of Nine in chat says, these experiences give the Museum of Ice Cream vibes very, very much.

256
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know...

257
00:16:53,744 --> 00:17:22,897
[SPEAKER_03]: but I you know it's a new thing for Universal and I think if they just invest a little more in it like that whole Simpsons thing going down I would love to see them set up a permanent Star Trek thing fucking rebuild what you had at the Hilton 20 years ago at the Star Trek experience that shit was amazing rebuild that at Universal again I don't know how the Universal and Paramount arrangements work but fucking figure it out because that would be amazing to have a sense of permanent permanency I'll tell you people cosplay people dress up and Star Trek

258
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:31,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Outnumbered everything else But there was a fair amount of Wizard Boy And there was a fair amount of, um Uh

259
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:34,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to the Future

[SPEAKER_03]: I saw some great queens there I had a really good time Is Mayhem still hosting?

263
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:21,333
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my god, I wish I could have seen Mayhem there No, the queens were not Drag Race queens but they were still very talented I was there when Mayhem was still hosting That's awesome I think the lead's name was Beatrix Couture and then her sister Kiki or Kiko Couture was one of the

[SPEAKER_03]: Axe, and then I do not remember the name of the third act.

[SPEAKER_03]: I regret.

00:19:25,295 --> 00:19:25,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

267
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:26,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to look it up on my phone.

268
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:28,556
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were all very talented.

269
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they did a good job.

270
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:35,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's... Oh, hey, PixelPockets in chat says it was so nice to see you.

00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The concert was awesome.

272
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you for the kind words from you both.

273
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was great to meet you and all that good stuff.

274
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:42,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry I didn't get to spend more time with you.

275
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:46,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had met up right before Rita Ora was about to take the stage and we wanted to see it all.

276
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:46,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

277
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,046
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into video game news.

278
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:51,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some big news this week.

279
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:53,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you want to start us off?

280
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of knew this was coming, but it sucks.

281
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:58,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Who could have guessed that this was going to be a thing?

282
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks to hear, but here we are.

283
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:04,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a moment and once again, thank Nintendo.

284
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:11,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Nintendo, for being the leaders in raising prices on your fucking games when they don't need to be raised.

285
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:38,924
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't want to hear about terrorist bullshit because they were going to do it anyways because they justified their game being that price and I mean when you think about it most games now are sold digitally so really they don't have to manufacture those cartridges and I'm not even sure if Mario Kart is one of those ones that actually has a cartridge in it because it may be just one of those yeah it's a license on the cart type thing I believe they have confirmed first party releases are not that

286
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:44,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well that's good at least, but once again, doesn't matter, because guess what?

287
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft's saying, hey, hey, hey, we want to copy Nintendo too!

288
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:52,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, of course, being that that door's been, you know...

289
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,291
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:16,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Series S $379.99 $512.01

291
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:46,269
[SPEAKER_05]: then we have a 1TB Xbox Series S for $429.99 the Xbox Series X Digital $549.99 Xbox Series X $599.99 $599.99 that's right and then finally the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition $729.99

292
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:05,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

293
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it so much more?

294
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,221
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when they're not winning the

295
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:42,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the tariffs are to blame for the hardware increases.

296
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, I expect Sony to do the same this week.

297
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I 100% do as well.

298
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what kind of stock they already have sitting in America.

299
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the key question.

300
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,502
[SPEAKER_03]: How much stock do these companies have sitting in America that they think they can safely burn through before the holidays?

301
00:22:56,562 --> 00:23:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Sony has to move their hand and make an announcement similar to this as well.

302
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:01,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

303
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's where shit gets complicated.

304
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:06,689
[SPEAKER_03]: They did not have to raise the price of the games to $80.

305
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:10,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki's 100% on that.

306
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously Nintendo was the first.

307
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:20,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I wouldn't be shocked if there wasn't some type of... And I'm not saying the big three are in cahoots...

308
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:21,689
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

309
00:23:39,184 --> 00:24:05,557
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where Microsoft loses me a little bit I get that they were wanting to secretly raise the price of Call of Duty and shit to $80 as well they wanted to follow suit hey if Nintendo can do this we're going to do this as well to you know get our people paid and what have you because we have these huge teams creating these games and so forth I get that I do not like the optics of them announcing that the same day as what was clearly impacted by tariffs because it makes it look like the tariffs is impacting the game prices but

310
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:06,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big fan of that.

311
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:14,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think, Loki, whether we like it or not, the industry sort of agreed we were going to go to $80 this year.

312
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,021
[SPEAKER_05]: and Sony's gonna do it.

313
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:31,967
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the AAA industry, no, the AAA companies decided this and you know what, fuck them because like, seriously, it doesn't matter.

314
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:49,701
[SPEAKER_05]: They can raise the prices all they want and they can justify it all they want and then you can have the stupid fucking corporate defenders, seriously, fuck all of them, showing me a wonderful little insert from KB Toys from back in the goddamn 90s where, you know, Super Nintendo games were $90.

315
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what, folks?

316
00:24:52,663 --> 00:24:55,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Your games are much more than $90 right now.

317
00:24:56,186 --> 00:25:00,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you see, back in the Super Nintendo days, your game, it's done.

318
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

319
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:04,271
[SPEAKER_05]: You got your game, it's complete, it's done.

320
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not paying $70 up front.

321
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,036
[SPEAKER_05]: $20 for a fucking season pass for something.

322
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: $30 for some more DLC that may or may not come out.

323
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:21,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a fucking roadmap because the game's goddamn not done because they found a way, oh, well, we could just patch it in later on.

324
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:27,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting sold unfinished games for more fucking money with more monetization on top of all that.

325
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:30,006
[SPEAKER_05]: These companies are not scraping by by pennies.

326
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,888
[SPEAKER_05]: They are making billions of fucking dollars every year.

327
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can fucking afford to pay their goddamn employees.

328
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:37,073
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know who they're paying instead?

329
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,975
[SPEAKER_05]: They're paying their fucking CEOs instead.

330
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't give me this fucking shit.

331
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:45,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of fucking hearing about the entire industry not able to put out a game for $80 or less.

332
00:25:47,423 --> 00:25:49,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, they're not able to put out a game for under $80.

333
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:50,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit!

334
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:51,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at fucking Expedition 33.

335
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the fucking Oblivion fucking remaster.

336
00:25:55,249 --> 00:26:03,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all these other great games that are coming out from indie studios for far less money and far more polish than this bullshit they have to pay for every single year.

337
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:06,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Madden every single year is just fucking churned up bullshit

338
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:31,301
[SPEAKER_05]: year after year people complain about it and they keep buying it so don't give me this shit about how oh we're so poor we're not feasible guess what if your company cannot operate within those you know within that constraint then you're not profitable then you have to just dissolve as a company it's just not gonna happen and i'm not gonna give them eighty dollars because thinking that's going to the developers bullshit they'll lay them all fucking off

339
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,729
[SPEAKER_05]: After they develop their characters, write their stories, put out their games or whatever.

340
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:37,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter if their game's successful, fails, whatever.

341
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,563
[SPEAKER_05]: They will write them off as literal just...

342
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,382
[SPEAKER_05]: tools for their fucking industry.

343
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:47,683
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to get AI in there anyways already just to make the shareholder costs go up.

344
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:49,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So fuck them all.

345
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sick and tired of it.

346
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:57,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I hate the impact that it's going to have on the industry as far as developers go and the layoffs that they're going to be and stuff like that.

347
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:59,388
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hate thinking about that.

348
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:00,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We're already living in that world.

349
00:27:01,548 --> 00:27:03,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this industry is ready for a crash.

350
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:10,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that everybody needs to come to Jesus and fucking just, it needs a crash so they can reset and get out of this bullshit that we're in.

351
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:14,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree.

352
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:16,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yes.

353
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:21,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I'm like, oh, Loki, you're so harsh on Nintendo.

354
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:24,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly don't disagree with anything you just said.

355
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:31,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, like, Grand Theft Auto is going to come out for $100, and then Madden's going to be like, well, we deserve $100 because our game is that pulse.

356
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: No, fucking no, it isn't, but they're going to do it.

357
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:35,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to keep going up.

358
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:36,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You hit the nail on the head.

359
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,557
[SPEAKER_03]: People in chat are saying it, and we're all thinking it.

360
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all thinking it, but the people who don't realize this are the people in the boardrooms that should be shaking in their fucking boots at Claire Obscure Expedition 33.

361
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,281
[SPEAKER_03]: That game, and I haven't even played it yet.

362
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been so fucking busy, I haven't played it yet.

363
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you right now, that game is going to win Game of the Year at the Game Awards.

364
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:00,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have to play it.

365
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,243
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just see on your reactions.

366
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fucking see Metacritic, for better or for worse, what that site means.

367
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you that fucking game's winning gaming of the year.

368
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:13,087
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 30 people, most of them laid off from a AAA studio.

369
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:23,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They came together in France, put that game together, released it for $50, and sold a million copies in a genre that we have been told we don't want.

370
00:28:24,232 --> 00:28:26,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Kiyoshita, I love him to bits.

371
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: He saved the Final Fantasy Online franchise.

372
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:38,838
[SPEAKER_03]: He got this wrong when he said that people would not want to play a turn-based RPG with the fancy graphics, that they need to have the fast, fluid stuff to go with the graphics.

373
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:53,284
[SPEAKER_03]: He got that wrong, and Claire Obscura Expedition 33 selling one million copies in three days, in addition to it being on Game Pass, is fucking proof that should have the entire industry in the boardrooms of the AAA companies shitting

374
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:54,824
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pants right now.

375
00:28:55,064 --> 00:29:07,127
[SPEAKER_03]: But they won't be because they are too oblivious because the people that are telling them, because all these websites will get into this that have the pulse on what gamers are really about or going under now.

376
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:11,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So all these boardrooms have investors to rely on to get advice and shit.

377
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:17,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And investors are going to be like, Yeah, AI is going to be the big answer.

378
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,670
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what gamers want is AI.

379
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the fuck we don't.

380
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:46,119
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's gamers and board executives and boardrooms aren't listening to this podcast and if they were they unsubscribed a long time ago let me tell you so but that game should have the entire industry shitting its pants that being said I could have said pretty much the exact same thing about Baldur's Gate 3 and we haven't seen the changes yet

381
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:53,990
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think everyone's fucking afraid of Larian because they've completely broke the mold.

382
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,172
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that they were doing DLC.

383
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:00,536
[SPEAKER_01]: It's they were giving people more and they weren't charging for it.

384
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you know, we think that was a good idea from so-and-so's mod.

385
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a whole new part of the game that's got those things that you were modding in.

386
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,524
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made it permanent.

387
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:13,049
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you want to mod your game?

388
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:19,219
[SPEAKER_01]: here, just mod it all together oh, you want full game making access to everything?

389
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,308
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we'll tell these people so they'll tell you how to do it you know

390
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:32,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwell is pointing out Hello Games as well, you know, despite all of the bullshit that No Man's Sky got in the beginning.

391
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:50,011
[SPEAKER_03]: A game company pour the love into that game that you have from Hello Games.

392
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:52,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're a relatively very small team.

393
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:57,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're a smaller group than the company that did Claire Obscure, to be honest.

394
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:06,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've made their money with all this time, with all the different versions and sales and worldwide sales and all that stuff.

395
00:31:06,774 --> 00:31:07,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a success story too.

396
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:10,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Loki, when you say...

397
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That the industry is going to crash.

398
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:16,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the AAA industry is headed for big trouble.

399
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You are absolutely right.

400
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:18,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think.

401
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

402
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:25,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's going to be a full industry crash because you've got a lot of indie studios out there.

403
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:26,739
[SPEAKER_03]: The smaller teams.

404
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,020
[SPEAKER_03]: The smaller teams are going to rise up.

405
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:34,287
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't get me wrong, I don't wish for people to be laid off and all this stuff.

406
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:36,649
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is that they're already doing that.

407
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:39,972
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already doing that with... And who's not getting laid off?

408
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,593
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad decision makers.

409
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The stupid CEOs.

410
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:43,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

411
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:44,296
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just...

412
00:31:45,376 --> 00:32:14,077
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not bringing any profit or any sort of like anything into this like you're making bad decisions I mean sure they may be profitable decisions but like I guess we're just at this you know point in time that you know ethics are out the window it's just what can we do to make this most profit what can we do to gather as much profit for ourselves as we can is kind of unfortunately where people are taking it I don't know what it's going to take for

413
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

414
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:38,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need the people at the top of the existing AAA industry and the people at the top underlying Bolded.

415
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:41,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not need those people to figure out the secret to success.

416
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to fucking find it.

417
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:52,242
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need is for these people, you know, we always say we hope these folks that get laid off are able to find something else or able to start their own studio and able to do this thing.

418
00:32:52,482 --> 00:33:00,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is not everybody has the capital, not everybody has the investor to back this, but thank gosh the team behind Clare Obscure did have that

419
00:33:00,723 --> 00:33:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: because now they're setting a blueprint for the fuck you need Ubisoft.

420
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:07,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't fucking need Ubisoft.

421
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't.

422
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:09,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.

423
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:11,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what they did without them.

424
00:33:13,516 --> 00:33:14,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be more.

425
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:15,999
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be more.

426
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:42,695
[SPEAKER_03]: uh Bobby in chat says I said the AAA industry will crash for years and it hasn't happened yet though you know I get it I get it I feel like we've been saying that too as well I do feel like there's a lot more factors now that are going to accelerate that like tariffs uh and that whole thing uh Bobby Blackwell also says the AAA movie industry equivalent is also in a rut like this absolutely now the one thing I did want to say about you know Microsoft because you what's interesting is what you called out

427
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:56,307
[SPEAKER_03]: You called out Claire Obscure and Oblivion Remastered as examples of what indie studios can do, even though I think we should clarify, of course, Oblivion Remastered being a Bethesda game isn't exactly indie.

428
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,768
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the studio... It's still not an $80 game.

429
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:03,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But the studio that zhuzhed it up is also a little more independent.

430
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:04,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

431
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:05,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Volt or something.

432
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:06,970
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the name of the company that did that?

433
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,130
[SPEAKER_03]: V-something?

434
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Volcom?

435
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,130
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's a Tron thing.

436
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:10,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

437
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So the company that did that is a little bit more...

438
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass

439
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:52,757
[SPEAKER_03]: especially with two huge games on it right now and more to come with your Call of Duty and, you know, other Microsoft things.

440
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's just something interesting.

441
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:55,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

442
00:34:57,581 --> 00:34:57,841
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

443
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:03,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll be curious to see what those console sales look like because I think it's going to be slim to none.

444
00:35:03,924 --> 00:35:06,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody knows they can get those things cheaper.

445
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:10,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the second-hand market is going to become very interesting.

446
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:11,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Virtuos.

447
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:14,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Questbuster, was the studio that worked on Oblivion.

448
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:20,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with those consoles.

449
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Sony, like Ranma had said earlier in chat, and I think a lot of you are thinking it too, Sony is probably going to follow this with hardware very soon.

450
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:32,146
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

451
00:35:46,414 --> 00:35:47,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that will be the case.

452
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:51,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people may get a little picky choosier with their game buying.

453
00:35:51,997 --> 00:35:57,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mario Kart is going to be a false flag because Mario Kart is bundled with most Switch 2s at this point.

454
00:35:57,881 --> 00:35:59,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mario Kart is going to be a false flag.

455
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:07,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be very interested to see how things like Zelda's $90 edition and all this.

456
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be very interested to see how that actually sells.

457
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:40,665
[SPEAKER_05]: well and that's the thing that's kind of funny about it too is like I was I watched someone like industry analysts like talk about like what they thought based off of the sales of stuff and they're like yeah look at Mario Kart sold so well by itself too I'm like yeah because people couldn't buy the bundle it was probably sold out so they were buying it separately instead like it's not that it's people aren't just buying the game by itself it's just ridiculous but yeah I think it's gonna be interesting to see I mean because I mean let's be honest like

458
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:50,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Games can go up as much as they want, but what's not going up along with that is people's salaries.

459
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:52,908
[SPEAKER_05]: People's salaries are not going up that.

460
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is getting more expensive.

461
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:57,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to affect everything.

462
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,531
[SPEAKER_05]: That is just...

463
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:03,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The people are not going to go without food to have Mario Kart World.

464
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:06,996
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, like it is just going to be a thing that happens.

465
00:37:07,196 --> 00:37:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to hopefully get to a point where people are more selective about the games that they're picking, because then if a game is coming out unfinished from EA or whatever the case may be.

466
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

467
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:41,185
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

468
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:22,211
[SPEAKER_05]: which is basically piracy gamers are going to actually play their backlogs exactly, the backlogs, these little retro sticks like Loki was talking about last week that have a bunch of old games on them it plays Switch games too but yeah, it's mainly meant for older games and there's a lot of stuff I'm looking forward to getting back into trying some of these older games so

469
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:31,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, uh, RinMari in chat says, personally, the price hike doesn't really impact me as much because I mostly play lower budget indie games that are usually no more than $30.

470
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what a lot of people are going to start.

471
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:43,728
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see more things that are a huge success like Bellatro, uh, Vampire Survivors, you know, those types of things that are relatively cheap and doing very well right now.

472
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:48,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, QuestBuster says, on Loki's note, I'll be picky by looking more to Game Pass.

473
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:49,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

474
00:38:49,231 --> 00:38:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

475
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:49,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

476
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:11,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, these $90 or $80 games or whatever, they're just not going to be included in Game Pass Day 1 or something like that.

477
00:39:11,888 --> 00:39:19,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you buy the fourth Ultra Super tier that is even more expensive or something like that.

478
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:20,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

479
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Here comes the return of Gamefly.

480
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:44,501
[SPEAKER_03]: which actually I believe is still a thing and I think I saw some chatter online about this but maybe there's going to be demand for you know just having you know paying a monthly fee to rent a game temporarily you know especially because it'll work with the cart licenses and all that stuff so it'll be interesting to see Bobby Blackwolf says I still have Gamefly and I'm absolutely keeping it even though they raised the price

481
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's move on.

482
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:52,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing Game Pass or otherwise around the gaming sphere.

483
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:53,898
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you.

484
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,660
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

485
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:58,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the same as always.

486
00:39:59,451 --> 00:40:04,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing, I didn't actually play Mass Effect this week.

487
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:12,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Palia just because I was pretty unwell on Friday and I was still feeling under the weather last night and better today.

488
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,664
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely Dead by Daylight and then, you know, a few other random bits and bobs.

489
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:24,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting a portal pinball.

490
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:27,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was like, ooh, like a portal to hell in your garage.

491
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:31,704
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going to have the portal pinball.

492
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:32,284
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be fun.

493
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:32,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

494
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:33,824
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

495
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:34,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

496
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:36,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

497
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:37,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we'll go to Loki.

498
00:40:37,546 --> 00:40:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

499
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:55,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mostly playing Minecraft this week as usual like I always do and then I was working on setting up my Retro Pocket Flip 2 so I think I have it pretty much done I'm about like 95% done with that

500
00:40:57,348 --> 00:41:14,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Vita emulation is a pain in the ass I must say but it is exciting to see how well it runs like I said it does run some Switch games I did get Mario Odyssey when I turned down the resolution a bunch on it to run somewhat well

501
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:44,222
[SPEAKER_05]: um not that I'm probably going to be playing that because I've already played through that whole game before I just wanted to see what will actually run on it but yeah the Mario Kart stuff uh looking forward to that got all the Animal Crossings on there um so that'll be fun and uh funny enough actually a lot of like indie games um like a lot of aftermarket uh games for all these different consoles and stuff checking those out and translations be able to play a lot of stuff that hasn't been put out there um now

502
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:52,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be... I, of course, need to talk about, like, my Blue Sky post earlier this week.

503
00:41:52,608 --> 00:42:05,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one thing I did decide to do this week as well is put my game, Pixel Poops 2, which was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System, to drop that to free.

504
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everyone's paying already a ton...

505
00:42:08,514 --> 00:42:09,555
[SPEAKER_05]: in just everything.

506
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And so why not just be able to enjoy something for free without having to pay a ton of extra money for things?

507
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is free.

508
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:22,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be honest, I wasn't really making anything off of it anyways, but it is going to be free for...

509
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:26,067
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

510
00:42:44,218 --> 00:42:48,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then I sent YYR some messages.

511
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:52,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked to him like a while ago about, you know, putting the Steam version for free.

512
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should eventually follow suit as well, since he gets my messages.

513
00:42:57,376 --> 00:42:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

514
00:42:59,353 --> 00:43:26,894
[SPEAKER_05]: but I know he's busy so but the very least on itch.io it's it is free so you can get it there but yeah yeah so hopefully hopefully you guys enjoy that and just glad to get people to be able to check it out and again that's pixel poops number two on itch.io and the storefront or store name is tech master games is itch.io right yes if you want to it is a free download but it is there is an option to download

515
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:49,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Pay money if you'd like to, you don't have to though Which SSJ100 Matt in chat says buy the game now on Steam if you want to give Loki money But you do have a tip jar which is also available to give money to Yeah, it's basically free, but you can either put $0 or any amount on there But yeah, you don't have to pay for it Awesome

516
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:53,891
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

517
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:10,706
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the new Diablo 4 season started.

518
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:25,023
[SPEAKER_03]: The twist in Diablo 4 this season is a little bit, I don't know, I guess I'd call it Blue Mage because you fight bosses and then when you take down the boss, you kind of get their power and you can, you know, cycle four of them in at a time and sort of, you know, change your builds around it.

519
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:26,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a neat little mechanic, I guess.

520
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:27,946
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

521
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You no longer have like a tier 1, 2, 3, kind of like you have in Dead by Daylight or Fortnite where you unlock things by tier.

522
00:44:54,407 --> 00:45:04,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, they made it so that you earn tokens and you use the tokens to buy what you want from the Battle Pass, which I think will be more popular.

523
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure it makes the Battle Pass as...

524
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:38,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people will spend less to get what it is they want but maybe this is a that is the play by Blizzard to get more people to buy into this system because I'm going to guess not a lot were so that's kind of my thought it's kind of a weird system I don't like that now the smoldering ashes don't unlock for forever and they took away the ones that boost XP that part I don't like but otherwise I don't have too much to complain about I'm still playing Diablo 4 so I should tell you that

525
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:59,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make it a point to get to Claire Obscure this week now that now that trip season is settled a little bit until my trip at the end of June so I have a few weeks okay um let's move on and get into other gaming news because there was quite a bit that happened this week and uh seriously a lot of changes on the internet blog front right Loki?

526
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, everybody is just getting shut down, sold, who knows.

527
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,364
[SPEAKER_05]: But Fandom has essentially shut down Giant Bomb, I guess.

528
00:46:12,796 --> 00:46:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They, apparently, Giant Bomb had some sort of falling out with their parent company fandom, and I know that a few of the people actually left there as well.

529
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:37,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently, creative director Dan Reichert announced that he will no longer appear on the Giant Bomb cast, and Jeff Grubb is confirmed that he is no longer with the company.

530
00:46:38,608 --> 00:47:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: and Fandom they said that it's a strategic reset and realignment of their media brands whatever the fuck that means anyways so I don't know if they're going to be kind of resetting it into some sort of AI slop factory type thing or what they're going to be using their branding for but yeah I don't know

531
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's not all Polygon has been sold to Valnet and also they have had to deal with massive layoffs so of course this is also coming out through social media as well lots of different people stating that they're no longer with the company including Chris Plant who was the Polygon co-founder and editor-in-chief um

532
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

533
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:43,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is also kind of one of those things where they're pivoting into more of like a content farm type thing.

534
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:46,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

535
00:47:47,592 --> 00:47:48,553
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that sucks.

536
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:54,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Some really good sites that are kind of going under because of this type of content.

537
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:55,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of these that we've

538
00:47:57,317 --> 00:48:15,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I've looked at for a while now that are just slopped now like you can hardly use them because of just the numerous guides or slideshows or whatever they want to do so you can get as many page views as possible to see as many ads as possible it's just a mess

539
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,653
[SPEAKER_03]: The pivot to guides has been happening everywhere, too.

540
00:48:18,913 --> 00:48:20,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gross.

541
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:39,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, AI is going to fuck them all with that because AI is stealing those guides and putting it into the AI system so that when people have those questions about how do I beat the boss on level two, AI is going to answer that now without having to go to those pages because AI stole from those pages.

542
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a no-win situation, I think, for a lot of those.

543
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:49,316
[SPEAKER_03]: But... I don't know.

544
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:50,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be honest.

545
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read either of those sites in a very long time.

546
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those websites got rid of their biggest problem in 2017.

547
00:49:00,029 --> 00:49:01,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm going to say about that.

548
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:01,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

549
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... They never really worked their way into my rotation.

550
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I would see them linked on social media, which is the way that I think most social... I think most people are getting their gaming news.

551
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:27,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the reality, is that when so much news gets reduced to 300 characters or less, or whatever the limit currently is on X...

552
00:49:29,326 --> 00:49:30,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 300 on Blue Sky.

553
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:37,874
[SPEAKER_03]: When the content gets reduced to that many characters or less, a lot of things get missing.

554
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:46,262
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a story coming up later that is exactly this, where I think a lot of the context gets missing because of that little short headline.

555
00:49:46,603 --> 00:49:48,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But so many of us are...

556
00:49:49,165 --> 00:50:01,013
[SPEAKER_03]: getting our news from social media and those types of things now that, you know, we're not we don't have a lot of space, I think, for those more long form articles, which I'm not saying there shouldn't be a place for those.

557
00:50:01,273 --> 00:50:04,835
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some very well researched, very interesting things that I read out there.

558
00:50:05,556 --> 00:50:08,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Eurogamer still cranks out some bangers on that front.

559
00:50:08,678 --> 00:50:11,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there's one pretty recently I read over there, I think.

560
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's there's

561
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:26,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain sites that do some really interesting long-form reports, but the reality is most of those short hits end up getting taken by social media.

562
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:34,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, Ranmari in chat says, my problem with going to news sites is being subjected to ads and getting shamed for using an ad blocker.

563
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem with ads.

564
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:45,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a problem with the bullshit barrage of ads, especially on mobile, that like are literally just there to kill your browser.

565
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:52,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would hope that the brains behind these organizations are very aware of the fact that I...

566
00:50:53,263 --> 00:50:57,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually way prefer Safari over Chrome right now when I'm browsing mobile.

567
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:58,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yes.

568
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Way prefer it for two reasons.

569
00:51:00,553 --> 00:51:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, it is very easy to flip to reader mode.

570
00:51:03,818 --> 00:51:04,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Very easy.

571
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:06,942
[SPEAKER_03]: You do two taps and you're in reader mode.

572
00:51:06,962 --> 00:51:08,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll get you around CNN's paywall, by the way.

573
00:51:10,996 --> 00:51:12,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a second thing, by the way.

574
00:51:32,486 --> 00:51:48,090
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, if you're using Safari on a Mac and you have developer mode enabled, which is just a click, if you go and right-click on something, inspect element, you can actually find the code for it and delete it from the active version that you're using.

575
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:48,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

576
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a blank area on the page.

577
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:53,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.

578
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,952
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hide attribute.

579
00:51:55,072 --> 00:51:56,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You can delete node.

580
00:51:56,932 --> 00:52:01,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you reload the page, yeah, it comes back, but it's gone while you're using it.

581
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd do that for half of our stories so I can at least see them be pretty.

582
00:52:05,766 --> 00:52:09,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, reader mode is on Mac OS Safari.

583
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says Edge greater than Safari.

584
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:14,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that, but I will.

585
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

586
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:16,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Safari is far better.

587
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,131
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all opinions.

588
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But Safari, they don't make it on PC.

589
00:52:20,872 --> 00:52:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably use it if they did.

590
00:52:22,232 --> 00:52:22,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

591
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,353
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they haven't made it for a long time.

592
00:52:25,673 --> 00:52:26,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to.

593
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:28,233
[SPEAKER_03]: 8.0 or 9.0 was.

594
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:29,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't make it anymore.

595
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:29,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

596
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:32,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't well optimized back in the day either.

597
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:35,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It would probably be a lot better now if they would have invested in it on PC.

598
00:52:36,335 --> 00:52:36,755
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't.

599
00:52:37,116 --> 00:52:38,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say I use...

600
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:40,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Ranma backs me up.

601
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:42,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear.

602
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:44,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, drop the download link, please.

603
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:45,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop the download link.

604
00:52:47,004 --> 00:52:51,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would say, and it needs to be the official download link.

605
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:58,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not send me to one of those sites that says grab old version or get, I want the official Apple download link for Safari on PC, please.

606
00:52:58,334 --> 00:52:58,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be waiting.

607
00:52:59,535 --> 00:52:59,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

608
00:53:00,456 --> 00:53:17,616
[SPEAKER_03]: and uh but I was gonna say with Edge and Chrome Chrome sucks now like Chrome sucks I've I've switched pretty much to using Edge much more often it's not I still do Chrome out of habit sometimes but but yeah I use Edge more than I use Chrome on desktop I will say so there is that

609
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't used Firefox in a while.

610
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:20,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, crap.

611
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's right.

612
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:31,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still... It looks like there is still the 64-bit version, but no.

613
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:31,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, never mind.

614
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:32,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand corrected.

615
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

616
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:33,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

617
00:53:35,569 --> 00:54:02,547
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh yeah so anyway i don't know how we got on browsers from that but um oh yeah the industry kind of shooting itself in the foot with the ad bloat uh when social media doesn't especially now blue sky as more and more people are migrating or mastodon let's you know be fair to both you know the open network protocols let's say and again like trek versus wars i myself may be on blue sky but i root for both because they are not x

618
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm rooting for both to succeed, to be quite honest.

619
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:16,767
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing about being the open network sort of protocol thing is that, you know, it's not even if the official Blue Sky app were to add ads.

620
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:37,220
[SPEAKER_03]: you would be able to download a third party app and have no ads that will happen in the next year I guarantee it Blue Sky's first party app is going to have ads at some point and then you'll just download a third party app to get around it that's going to happen as Blue Sky gets bigger and bigger so there's that um

621
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,732
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, Rimari in chat says there's already third-party apps for Blue Sky.

622
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:56,599
[SPEAKER_03]: There sure are because there was a whole thing about Blue Sky was asked to suppress accounts in a particular country or I think they risked being – I don't know all the facts, so I am cutting corners.

623
00:54:56,859 --> 00:54:57,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I fully admit.

624
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they were risking running illegally there.

625
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:01,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Turkey?

626
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It was – or Turkey or whatever you're supposed to pronounce it now.

627
00:55:07,024 --> 00:55:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Turkey, yeah.

628
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

629
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:26,051
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

630
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:44,560
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what leads to also some of the controversy.

631
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,482
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I saw Ranma also say, I don't feel safe on Blue Sky.

632
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:51,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that has to do with all the information that's public on a site like Clear Sky.

633
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:53,804
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see who you've blocked, who's blocked.

634
00:55:53,824 --> 00:55:55,285
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some people don't like that.

635
00:55:55,625 --> 00:56:01,267
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is kind of a downside to running openly like that is that all that is available.

636
00:56:01,788 --> 00:56:09,131
[SPEAKER_03]: They have said that they're working on some sort of privatization embedded within the app protocol for people that want private accounts.

637
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:12,473
[SPEAKER_03]: but I would expect that's still going to be another six months out.

638
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:16,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens in the future with that.

639
00:56:16,996 --> 00:56:18,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to know I blocked them.

640
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:19,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

641
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:35,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And my problem with Mastodon, just to be fair to both sides, is that my problem with Mastodon is that some people ran their servers like they were HOAs and if you couldn't trust the server to be the right individual, you might end up with somebody who's just going to basically end up

642
00:56:36,368 --> 00:56:38,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Throwing your blog away.

643
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:46,172
[SPEAKER_03]: But the URL you start directing people to is going to vanish because their hosted Mastodon thing ends up vanishing.

644
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:48,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just some issues I had with that.

645
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I just felt Blue Sky was kind of hitting on that a little better.

646
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,375
[SPEAKER_03]: But you are free to make your choice.

647
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:59,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I still support both because again, Elon Musk can never own neither.

648
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So either is fine by me.

649
00:57:04,192 --> 00:57:08,194
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S says, I know the two people who have me blocked on Blue Sky and they can both kiss my ass.

650
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Only two?

651
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:11,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I have like 53 and they can all kiss my ass.

652
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a fuck.

653
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality is, I might have a hot take trademark that makes its way onto the Discover feed and somebody just decides they don't like it so they're going to block me.

654
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:29,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there's a picture of me and they don't like my old face so they're going to block me.

655
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:33,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just have to deal with the fact that some people are just...

656
00:57:34,508 --> 00:57:47,204
[SPEAKER_01]: mean like why why why why should we care I know I don't I don't fuck those people they don't belong in my life I don't care yeah their loss I mean why is it important yeah

657
00:57:48,578 --> 00:57:50,919
[SPEAKER_01]: They've removed themselves from my universe.

658
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

659
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,860
[SPEAKER_01]: You save me effort.

660
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:55,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Eat a bag of dicks while you're at it.

661
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says there was a site that shows you who has blocked you on Blue Sky.

662
00:57:58,803 --> 00:57:59,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's called Clear Sky.

663
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've used that.

664
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:05,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had to laugh at certain people.

665
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:08,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

666
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:16,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about a lawsuit that really shouldn't surprise me, but it's one of those things where, oh yeah, I kind of forgot this happened.

667
00:58:17,881 --> 00:58:24,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe what Nintendo was trying to avoid was that whole Streisand effect of if you sue it, you're confirming it.

668
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:29,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now that Nintendo's confirmed the Switch 2, guess what?

669
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,604
[SPEAKER_03]: They're suing Genki.

670
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember that Genki had unauthorized mock-ups of the Switch 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2025.

671
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:46,128
[SPEAKER_03]: In the lawsuit that was filed on Friday, Nintendo has accused Genki of trademark infringement

672
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:51,513
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

673
00:59:02,603 --> 00:59:09,769
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually, I believe, used some posts on X in the lawsuit, too.

674
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:17,475
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point, Genki said they do not own or possess a black market console, but they basically highly implied that they had access to all the specs.

675
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,857
[SPEAKER_03]: They had somebody on the inside.

676
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:23,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were getting information or buying it.

677
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

678
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

679
00:59:24,281 --> 00:59:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: But Nintendo is basically saying those statements were contradictory and inconsistent.

680
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:29,365
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

681
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:50,418
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:13,543
[SPEAKER_03]: love them or hate them, especially when it comes to Nintendo's legal department, love them or hate them, you can't deny they did the smart thing here.

683
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:18,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They waited until the news was out there, then they sued them.

684
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:28,401
[SPEAKER_03]: They waited to be the ones and say, yes, confirmed, rather than let the lawsuit say, yes, confirmed, as has happened so many other times in the industry.

685
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:37,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So, love them or hate them, give Nintendo's legal department that ounce of credit that they waited until the right time to do it.

686
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: When this happened, I was looking at Genki going, they're going to get sued.

687
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:45,978
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

688
01:01:03,388 --> 01:01:15,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about, though, people actually doing something good, Epic Games has actually set out to eliminate revenue fees for smaller developers.

689
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:23,239
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a new fee structure going into effect in June, and it will apply to a developer's revenue on a per-app basis.

690
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:30,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the first million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12% fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.

691
01:01:31,964 --> 01:01:54,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, that will help small developers who may not expect to get those big sales to start with And it's not the first time that they've done things to help out In 2011, they basically were like, you know, don't worry about the royalty payments At least for the first $50,000 in sales that were made with the Unreal Development Kit

692
01:01:55,401 --> 01:02:05,255
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2020 it was increased to cover the first million in lifetime sales for a project so and I mean

693
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they're kind of fighting back and forth a little bit with Valve on this because Valve in 2018 they cut their default 30% to 25% and that's for lifetime per game earnings exceeding $10 million and then it goes down to 20% after $50 million but honestly though this is fairly generous for the smaller developers so

694
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:36,632
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

695
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:44,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's interesting to see the little store wars continuing that, you know, there is a little competition in that space.

696
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:47,174
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there are plenty of other folks that would love to get in that space.

697
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:53,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, technically, like good old games kind of tries to carve their niche in the whole, you know, preservation program.

698
01:02:53,757 --> 01:02:55,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are even, you know, third options out there.

699
01:02:55,738 --> 01:03:01,861
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's interesting to see how these two stores are trying to attract developers and exclusives and all that good stuff.

700
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:02,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, yeah.

701
01:03:03,162 --> 01:03:05,083
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture says LOL store wars.

702
01:03:05,183 --> 01:03:06,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess it is May the 4th.

703
01:03:06,623 --> 01:03:07,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

704
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:11,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Revenge of the Steam tomorrow on this report, who knows alright

705
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Now coming out May 2026.

706
01:03:43,459 --> 01:03:43,899
[SPEAKER_05]: or not.

707
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:44,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

708
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.

709
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows.

710
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:52,763
[SPEAKER_03]: They're waiting for that $80 price tag to be standard so that they feel no guilt in charging $90.

711
01:03:52,823 --> 01:03:55,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure they're waiting for that.

712
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:58,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that has anything to do with it.

713
01:03:58,566 --> 01:03:59,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll go up to $100.

714
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:02,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if we just buy it our time.

715
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,008
[SPEAKER_03]: For a collector's edition?

716
01:04:04,248 --> 01:04:05,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

717
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:09,031
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think for the standard price, it's easily going to be $90.

718
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:12,152
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to push the envelope, I think.

719
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:24,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to try to... I think it's still $80 and there's a robust way to spend more money inside the game with things like Grand Theft Auto Online.

720
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:34,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's sort of the difference between Grand Theft Auto and this situation is that they have a very robust online economy as well.

721
01:04:35,509 --> 01:04:41,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they haven't made billions upon billions upon billions upon billions of dollars from this game or the previous game already.

722
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:48,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I mean, I could tell you the reasons why they delayed it, but you know the lines already.

723
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:54,617
[SPEAKER_05]: They need more time to polish it up to make it better.

724
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:55,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

725
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really need to read why.

726
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:04,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if they aren't crunching as a result, that's actually good news, I think.

727
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

728
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:08,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they not...

729
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we sure about that?

730
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:10,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

731
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some pull quote out there that says they're doing this in part to reduce their need for that, which if that... I hope so.

732
01:05:19,322 --> 01:05:20,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so, too.

733
01:05:20,203 --> 01:05:23,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I just... I don't... Exactly.

734
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:24,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

735
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:24,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

736
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,771
[SPEAKER_03]: A healthy amount of skepticism with that.

737
01:05:29,122 --> 01:05:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: is a totally appropriate um but you know we'll see what happens come April you know what the reports are saying in March or April next year before this goes gold if they're or especially during the holidays how how bad they're maybe having to crunch during the holidays so we'll see but you know what I remember when Animal Crossing got delayed it got delayed to 2020 in March and it ended up being the best delay Nintendo could have ever scheduled for a game

738
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm asking for COVID part two.

739
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:04,571
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes delays don't end up being the end of the world.

740
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:05,992
[SPEAKER_03]: How about second COVID?

741
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:06,893
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

742
01:06:08,894 --> 01:06:12,297
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the one that just locks the people we don't like in their houses?

743
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:14,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about Super Chlamydia?

744
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:20,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's going to be a thing because of all the things that they're shutting down at the federal level.

745
01:06:20,128 --> 01:06:22,168
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I don't want to digress.

746
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:25,709
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to let loose a whole bunch of koalas into the world.

747
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,150
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us ace people will be safe.

748
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:34,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonds006 in chat says, just asking how many years before they sunset the GTA 5 servers?

749
01:06:35,373 --> 01:06:38,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Well after GTA 6 is already up and running, that's for sure.

750
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:40,442
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

751
01:06:53,283 --> 01:06:53,663
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

752
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, you know what?

753
01:06:55,603 --> 01:07:01,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's use that to transition to a story about something else that kept support for a very long time.

754
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:12,847
[SPEAKER_03]: The Louvre, the museum in France, has ended their official support of the Nintendo 3DS console audio guides.

755
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:15,788
[SPEAKER_03]: This was actually a big deal when this rolled out.

756
01:07:15,808 --> 01:07:16,548
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

757
01:07:19,113 --> 01:07:22,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in 2012, there was a whole Nintendo 3DS Direct.

758
01:07:23,096 --> 01:07:27,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, it was in 2013, I think, when the actual Direct was.

759
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But the 3DS Audio Guides, I guess, started a little bit earlier.

760
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And it told you all about exhibits in English, French, of course, and many other languages as well.

761
01:07:36,565 --> 01:07:38,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could hear about the history of the Louvre.

762
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You could hear about the artwork inside.

763
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,630
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see high-resolution images and all that good stuff.

764
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:44,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

765
01:07:46,352 --> 01:07:59,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The guide is set to go out of operation in September of 2025 They are saying the 3DS will be replaced by a new system That's leading a lot of people to assume it could be a Switch or a Switch 2

766
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:08,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why it wouldn't just be mobile phones at this point, but I guess either of those is potential.

767
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,862
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep in mind, this museum is gigantic.

768
01:08:10,902 --> 01:08:14,844
[SPEAKER_03]: There is over 780,000 square feet.

769
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:22,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually always wanted to go, and it's not just for the Mona Lisa, but I love those museums you can just get lost in all fucking day.

770
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:24,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

771
01:08:26,232 --> 01:08:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: What I went, my biggest regret was I really should have booked all day for this place.

772
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:32,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't book myself enough time.

773
01:08:32,578 --> 01:08:37,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the Smithsonian, which isn't even just one museum.

774
01:08:37,382 --> 01:08:39,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously, you need like a week.

775
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:42,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I have literally gotten lost in the Smithsonian.

776
01:08:42,187 --> 01:08:42,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I will admit that.

777
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:44,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's gigantic.

778
01:08:44,809 --> 01:08:48,433
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I would love to go here someday, but it's just, you know.

779
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:50,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to DarkSakura.

780
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:14,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, let's.

781
01:09:15,891 --> 01:09:17,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is not so good news.

782
01:09:18,733 --> 01:09:28,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And in news of no one being surprised, EA basically is laying off about 300 to 400 positions.

783
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:32,447
[SPEAKER_01]: That's around 100 at Respawn and then the others.

784
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,591
[SPEAKER_01]: They did...

785
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:42,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am not sure exactly what these companies are thinking.

786
01:09:43,064 --> 01:09:47,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But here is a statement that was put out.

787
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:55,738
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we've made the decision to step away from two early stage incubation projects and make some targeted adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi.

788
01:09:56,018 --> 01:09:57,119
[SPEAKER_01]: This came from Respawn.

789
01:09:58,181 --> 01:09:58,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

790
01:09:59,756 --> 01:10:24,115
[SPEAKER_01]: and in January, EA had lowered its annual bookings forecast so yeah, it's coming down and this is including cancelling a Titanfall game so this was all reported by Bloomberg a few days ago who's surprised?

791
01:10:25,765 --> 01:10:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's unfortunate.

792
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:29,548
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read the bullshit statement that got released.

793
01:10:29,668 --> 01:10:29,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

794
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:34,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know it's a bullshit statement because they try to do those fancy keywords.

795
01:10:34,853 --> 01:10:36,594
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to translate into English, okay?

796
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:50,767
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively align teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.

797
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:51,487
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

798
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:58,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Translation, the CEO wants another Lamborghini, but if we don't make certain profits, he won't be able to afford it.

799
01:10:58,411 --> 01:11:01,933
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're laying off all these people so that their pay goes to the Lamborghini fund.

800
01:11:04,555 --> 01:11:05,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound about right?

801
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, unfortunately, it sure does.

802
01:11:09,836 --> 01:11:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.

803
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:13,758
[SPEAKER_03]: You hope that these people land on their feet somewhere.

804
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:17,199
[SPEAKER_03]: You hope there's a Claire Obscure story in here somewhere.

805
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:23,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is there are some people that are going to take this with the layoff news and everything and go, you know what?

806
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:33,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take these skills to the banking industry or the insurance industry or try to find a compatible type of thing for my skills in another industry.

807
01:11:33,646 --> 01:11:35,067
[SPEAKER_03]: The games industry just isn't for me.

808
01:11:35,807 --> 01:11:43,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's sad that we're going to lose some great art because of that because millions wasn't enough.

809
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:43,871
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed billions.

810
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:50,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see they're having a big massive sale, by the way, on Steam right now?

811
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:51,646
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't.

812
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been on Steam in a little bit.

813
01:11:53,907 --> 01:11:58,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Mass Effect Legendary Edition?

814
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Six bucks.

815
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:03,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's been really marked down in a few sales now.

816
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:04,553
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's cool.

817
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

818
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:13,518
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's like the Dragon Age games are pretty going down.

819
01:12:13,558 --> 01:12:15,079
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff.

820
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:17,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just thought I'd mention it.

821
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:17,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

822
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:21,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's move on to Loki.

823
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:28,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nintendo's doing some updates in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2.

824
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:45,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a brand new Switch update, version 20.0.0, which added the system transfers to Switch 2, as well as the new console game share features via virtual cards.

825
01:12:46,471 --> 01:12:52,215
[SPEAKER_05]: However, some folks are saying that they don't like the changes because they can't play

826
01:12:53,436 --> 01:13:00,202
[SPEAKER_05]: One version of the game across two systems at the same time, which, I mean, yeah, that makes sense that you can't do that.

827
01:13:00,302 --> 01:13:05,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if you were able to do that prior, that sounds like an exploit that they just patched now.

828
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they used to do is essentially that one person starts the game and then while the game is running, transfers that game to another person who then starts the game and then starts playing on that system.

829
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:20,419
[SPEAKER_05]: to like, for example, play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

830
01:13:20,599 --> 01:13:22,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like an exploit to me.

831
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes sense that it doesn't work that way.

832
01:13:26,642 --> 01:13:30,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why people are disappointed about this, but okay.

833
01:13:30,423 --> 01:13:34,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't take a game and make two games out of it.

834
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:34,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

835
01:13:35,606 --> 01:13:42,329
[SPEAKER_05]: At the very least, with the next Switch console, you still got that kind of share play stuff that they had with like the 3DS and DS and stuff like that.

836
01:13:42,629 --> 01:13:43,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'd be kind of cool.

837
01:13:43,449 --> 01:13:46,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, unfortunately, you're not going to be able to

838
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Convert one game into two to play Mario Kart Online.

839
01:13:51,915 --> 01:13:53,376
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot wish for more wishes.

840
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you cannot wish for more wishes.

841
01:13:55,979 --> 01:14:02,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with that, they also made some changes to the eShop, especially on how they show the best sellers.

842
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:10,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So best sellers originally would show the... It was arranged by total downloads over the last 14 days, and so you would get a lot of shovel...

843
01:14:11,354 --> 01:14:19,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Shovelware stuff that just kind of releasing games constantly so that they would always be in the best sellers or newly released list type things.

844
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:27,297
[SPEAKER_05]: However, now they're calculating it based off of the last three days worth of revenue that those games had made.

845
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So, based on the sales.

846
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:31,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That is better.

847
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:34,379
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still an issue with a lot of Shovelware stuff.

848
01:14:34,459 --> 01:14:38,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that gets a little bit less of a problem on the Switch too, but...

849
01:14:39,921 --> 01:14:42,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, any improvements better than what we had.

850
01:14:44,924 --> 01:14:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if anyone out there has used that virtual card update.

851
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:54,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at it and I was poking around, but Alan barely plays his Switch that he has now.

852
01:14:54,910 --> 01:15:00,174
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants a Switch 2 because he says he'll play Switch 1 games on a Switch 2 because that's how he is.

853
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:01,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, okay, whatever makes you happy.

854
01:15:02,695 --> 01:15:07,378
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have not yet really experienced the trading thing to see how that all works.

855
01:15:07,398 --> 01:15:08,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious if any of you...

856
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:14,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Alan and I are not currently on a family plan, but I'll put him on my plan once he's actually playing a Switch.

857
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

858
01:15:17,481 --> 01:15:26,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway, earlier in the show I mentioned, hey, there's this story that I think maybe social media's abbreviation could have kind of ruined.

859
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:30,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has to do with this Chrono Trigger remake news.

860
01:15:30,624 --> 01:15:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

861
01:15:31,824 --> 01:15:40,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We all kind of feel like a Chrono Trigger remake is going to happen at some point, but feelings don't make things true, and it especially doesn't make them true today.

862
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:45,391
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so apparently what happened is that there was...

863
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:57,078
[SPEAKER_03]: A panel that was happening in Italy or something, Napoli Comic Con was happening, and Yuji Horii was actually one of the guests that was there.

864
01:15:57,398 --> 01:16:13,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And through some news that came in through Reddit, Yuji Horii confirms Chrono Trigger remake at Comic Con in Naples, where basically the audience kind of went crazy because he said something along and the translator said, if this is true, this is big.

865
01:16:14,648 --> 01:16:18,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a confirmation, says the person who's running the panel.

866
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:20,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And the translator says, you heard nothing.

867
01:16:21,312 --> 01:16:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So there may have even been a translation weird thing that was going on.

868
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:29,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, later on, an update came in.

869
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,798
[SPEAKER_03]: There was footage from the panel.

870
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Italian.

871
01:16:33,259 --> 01:16:34,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Japanese.

872
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,202
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it was discussed about a remake of it.

873
01:16:37,562 --> 01:16:38,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But then in a...

874
01:16:39,483 --> 01:16:40,083
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

875
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It basically, yeah.

876
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:09,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It became this, oh, Chrono Trigger remake confirmed by Yuji Horii himself, which he's not going to do at a random Italian Comic Con.

877
01:17:09,853 --> 01:17:13,115
[SPEAKER_03]: No disrespect to the Italian Comic Con, which I'm sure is a fine event.

878
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:15,017
[SPEAKER_03]: No disrespect, but he's not going to...

879
01:17:15,817 --> 01:17:16,958
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

880
01:17:44,116 --> 01:17:58,252
[SPEAKER_03]: but again, this whole Claire Obscure ought to be making them turn their heads right now especially since you know Final Fantasy 17 is well into development at this point and I don't think they're going to be able to turn the ship around with whatever they're doing for Final Fantasy 17

881
01:17:59,193 --> 01:18:26,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it online, be it a single player game that's more action oriented like XVI We don't know, there's a million ways that game could be going But you know that game is well in development Because I think the thing they are going to do this time They're going to follow XVI's model of We are not announcing this shit until it's out in 18 months We're not going to do this 10 year lead up like we did with Final Fantasy XV So, but you gotta know they're looking at it

882
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it just goes to show that sometimes a simpler time and a simpler game is really the games that people want.

883
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:35,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So that takes us to our next segment.

884
01:18:46,845 --> 01:18:54,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

885
01:18:54,611 --> 01:18:57,053
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

886
01:18:58,086 --> 01:19:06,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, I'm not sure there is a more appropriately timed classic game of the week ever before than what you are doing tonight.

887
01:19:06,934 --> 01:19:08,335
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think I didn't do it on purpose?

888
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:10,537
[SPEAKER_03]: You absolutely did it on purpose and it's brilliant.

889
01:19:10,677 --> 01:19:11,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us all about it.

890
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:17,679
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the 1983 Atari Star Wars arcade game.

891
01:19:20,741 --> 01:19:21,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

892
01:19:21,781 --> 01:19:24,423
[SPEAKER_01]: If you skip a bit ahead, you'll also get to some music, too.

893
01:19:24,443 --> 01:19:25,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's playing on the stream.

894
01:19:26,024 --> 01:19:27,584
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't really been playing.

895
01:19:28,044 --> 01:19:30,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially this music could be a little dicey, but...

896
01:19:31,246 --> 01:19:32,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Just with copyright claims, but yes.

897
01:19:32,787 --> 01:19:37,509
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, the game is a first-person rail shooter.

898
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It was designed by Mike Halley, and it was released in 1983 by Atari.

899
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:53,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses 3D color vector graphics to simulate the assault on the Death Star from the original Star Wars.

900
01:19:55,038 --> 01:20:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: there are three different connected gameplay sequences there's combat against TIE fighters and then flying across the surface of the Death Star and then the trench run it then just keeps repeating and getting more and more complicated with the Death Star regenerating your X-Wing has a shield and it protects from damage a certain number of times and then the next hit ends the game

901
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,577
[SPEAKER_01]: It has speech synthesis to emulate the actors in the film.

902
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:31,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was considered, it's like on the list of one of the greatest video games of all time.

903
01:20:33,002 --> 01:20:36,064
[SPEAKER_01]: There were ports, there's all kinds of stuff.

904
01:20:36,084 --> 01:20:40,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was also an arcade sequel that was sold as a conversion kit in 1985 as Star Wars 6.

905
01:20:42,488 --> 01:21:11,180
[SPEAKER_01]: The Empire Strikes Back of course so you don't have to so in playing the game you don't have to like destroy every TIE fighter you just have to survive for a set number of time and then you have three attack phases in each wave so there you go so in the phase one you hear the Imperial March or another one of the Star Wars songs playing during the dog fight with Vader and the TIE fighters and

906
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:17,665
[SPEAKER_01]: and then base 2, you have to go to the surface of the Death Star to reach the trench.

907
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:22,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It is omitted during the first wave of the game.

908
01:21:22,848 --> 01:21:34,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get attacked by artillery on the surface and then you get laser turrets on towers and all of that.

909
01:21:34,637 --> 01:21:36,699
[SPEAKER_01]: You also get bonus for destroying the turrets.

910
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:39,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And in phase three, that's the trench run.

911
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:45,923
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you fail to hit the exhaust port, you lose a shield and you have to do the trench again.

912
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:57,208
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you manage to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, you are awarded points for using the force.

913
01:21:57,828 --> 01:21:59,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go back to the first phase.

914
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:11,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So the game started development in 1981 with the title Warp Speed, and it was headed up by Ed Rodberg, who also worked on Battlezone.

915
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:20,880
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller was designed for Army Battlezone, which was a Bradley fighting vehicle training simulator that Atari made for the US Army.

916
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:40,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Redberg left Atari and so Atari had signed a licensing agreement with Lucasfilm and then they finished the game of Star Wars so it was actually tested with focus groups January 24th 1983 by groups of 15 to 19 year old men 20 to 35 year old men and 17 to 30 year old women and

917
01:22:46,732 --> 01:23:07,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So as for the ports, it was converted first by Parker Brothers along with iMagic in 83 and 84 to come out on the Atari 2600, 5200, the Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision and Commodore 64 The ColecoVision version was programmed by one Wendell Brown

918
01:23:10,059 --> 01:23:33,245
[SPEAKER_01]: so going forward there was another conversion 87 and 88 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro and then further converted again for the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64 those versions were developed by a group called Vector with a K, Graphics with an X

919
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:36,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the Atari 8-bit version was by Zeppelin Games.

920
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:40,288
[SPEAKER_01]: They were published in Europe by Domark.

921
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:47,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Braderbund acquired the license to develop Star Wars games in the same year.

922
01:23:48,211 --> 01:23:48,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And

923
01:23:50,052 --> 01:24:01,039
[SPEAKER_01]: They published the Mac version, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS versions of the arcade games in North America in 1988, and then republished the Atari ST and Amiga versions in 89.

924
01:24:02,559 --> 01:24:08,203
[SPEAKER_01]: The Amiga and Atari ST have mouse control and have digitized sound effects.

925
01:24:09,283 --> 01:24:15,107
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mac version has sampled speech from the films, but no in-game music other than just the attract mode.

926
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:38,290
[SPEAKER_01]: it also appeared on the GameCube in Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike as a bonus minigame you could unlock after doing a level or doing a cheat code and also in the US and some European countries if you pre-ordered the game you got a special copy with that mode unlocked upon startup

927
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:43,774
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was Atari's top-selling 1983 arcade release.

928
01:24:43,974 --> 01:24:45,114
[SPEAKER_01]: They produced 12,695 cabinets.

929
01:24:49,109 --> 01:24:50,991
[SPEAKER_01]: It topped the play meter in the U.S.

930
01:24:51,272 --> 01:24:52,833
[SPEAKER_01]: for street locations in October 1983.

931
01:24:54,054 --> 01:25:02,682
[SPEAKER_01]: In Japan, Game Machine listed Star Wars on their November 1st, 1983 issue as being the most successful cockpit game.

932
01:25:03,563 --> 01:25:10,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Compute Magazine also said the Atari ST version was quote, "...amazing, smoothly animated."

933
01:25:13,368 --> 01:25:22,594
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also reviewed in Dragon Magazine, the Butterbund versions for MS-DOS, Amiga, ST, Commodore 64.

934
01:25:25,236 --> 01:25:29,299
[SPEAKER_01]: In this role of computers column and said the game had 3 out of 5 stars.

935
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:35,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Macworld said the Mac version was fast-paced action and challenging in higher levels.

936
01:25:35,223 --> 01:25:35,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean...

937
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:44,374
[SPEAKER_01]: The only real criticism from Macworld was that the master disk-based copy protection it

938
01:25:46,954 --> 01:25:53,918
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit harsh and said that the only three playable scenarios were limited replay value.

939
01:25:55,919 --> 01:26:01,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is probably on the record of some of the top games ever.

940
01:26:01,082 --> 01:26:05,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Several places have listed this as in their top 50 games of all time.

941
01:26:05,904 --> 01:26:11,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It's included in the top 100 arcade games of all time by the killer list of video games in 2001.

942
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:32,286
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I mentioned earlier the Star Wars arcade machines could be converted into Empire Strikes Back with a conversion kit and also the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ones were included also as extra content on Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike and

943
01:26:33,985 --> 01:26:45,892
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tastemakers LLC Arcade 1-Up division did a three-quarter scale recreation of the original cabinet with emulated versions of Star Wars Arcade, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.

944
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:51,835
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1984, Robert Rookzek, I hope I pronounced that right,

945
01:26:52,355 --> 01:26:57,498
[SPEAKER_01]: scored 300 million points in 49 hours of gameplay, and that was the world record at the time.

946
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:06,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2005, Brandon Erickson set a world endurance record of 54 hours on a single credit with a score of 283 million.

947
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:20,334
[SPEAKER_01]: June 85, Flavio Tosi, Dave Roberts, and Mike Ogren played as a team in turns for five days, two hours, and 26 minutes on a single credit to get the world record score of 1,000,012 points.

948
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:23,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

949
01:27:23,715 --> 01:27:24,476
[SPEAKER_01]: One, bunch of zeros, 12.

950
01:27:26,296 --> 01:27:31,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Verified in September 1985 edition of Computer and Video Games.

951
01:27:31,338 --> 01:27:32,878
[SPEAKER_01]: They raised money for charity that way.

952
01:27:34,699 --> 01:27:37,840
[SPEAKER_01]: The score counter turns over at 100 million points.

953
01:27:39,240 --> 01:28:05,375
[SPEAKER_01]: um it was uh they uh was decided to put machines on a harder setting for Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard um in an 86 tournament David Palmer scored 31,666,614 points in seven hours about seven hours a score that was published in the Guinness Book of World Records and remains unbeaten to this day and there you go wow

954
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:09,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love little messages on the planet.

955
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:09,978
[SPEAKER_03]: That was always my favorite.

956
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:14,982
[SPEAKER_03]: May the force be with you on that particular one we see in the video there live at Twitch TV.

957
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:18,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I definitely agree.

958
01:28:19,645 --> 01:28:22,387
[SPEAKER_03]: A, I can't believe you'd never picked this before, but I say that every week.

959
01:28:23,187 --> 01:28:24,268
[SPEAKER_03]: But what a great, timely...

960
01:28:25,509 --> 01:28:26,890
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

961
01:28:48,791 --> 01:29:14,114
[SPEAKER_03]: but every time I'm at Bobby's house at Black Wolf Manor and play his machine I'm like man I should have gotten one of these this is so fun so such a unique control mechanism too it's great all right let's hit on a few quick hit stories and then uh we'll get to world release dates and uh towards the end of the show believe it or not but I'm okay with that because your boy is tired after a long day driving all right so let's get to rapid fire news Loki

962
01:29:15,693 --> 01:29:30,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so apparently Jack Black's, one of the songs from the Minecraft movie, has broken a Billboard chart record for the shortest song to be in their top 100.

963
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:37,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is, of course, Steve's Lava Chicken, which is a very, very short song.

964
01:29:38,067 --> 01:29:38,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

965
01:29:40,309 --> 01:29:41,310
[SPEAKER_05]: 34 seconds long.

966
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:48,837
[SPEAKER_05]: The previous record was held by Kid Cudi's song Beautiful Trip, which is 37 seconds long.

967
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:51,119
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

968
01:29:51,139 --> 01:29:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And it reached 78 out of 100.

969
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:59,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's probably the way they rank things now with streaming and stuff.

970
01:29:59,682 --> 01:30:08,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see how short songs, it's a little different now than buying a CD for a 30-second song with streaming and everything.

971
01:30:08,526 --> 01:30:10,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids are probably playing it at parties and stuff.

972
01:30:10,847 --> 01:30:14,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably racking up the streaming credits, so that makes sense.

973
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

974
01:30:15,929 --> 01:30:16,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so...

975
01:30:23,129 --> 01:30:24,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuzo Koshiro.

976
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:27,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a name that we all love and adore.

977
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:27,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Love him.

978
01:30:29,051 --> 01:30:35,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the game he's involved with for Mega Drive or Genesis is called Eartheon.

979
01:30:35,954 --> 01:30:44,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And the website has gone live and it will be coming out for Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series.

980
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,959
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there is a Steam release coming out.

981
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:50,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still trying to see if there's going to be a Genesis version.

982
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,661
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to have this published by Limited Run Games.

983
01:30:55,801 --> 01:30:58,942
[SPEAKER_01]: There's video of it running on a Mega Drive.

984
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want it.

985
01:31:04,684 --> 01:31:05,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it.

986
01:31:05,144 --> 01:31:05,804
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty.

987
01:31:06,704 --> 01:31:09,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music, of course, is freaking fantastic.

988
01:31:09,765 --> 01:31:11,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait for the soundtrack either.

989
01:31:12,186 --> 01:31:12,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

990
01:31:12,546 --> 01:31:13,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so good.

991
01:31:13,466 --> 01:31:15,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the soundtrack will be the best part.

992
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:17,652
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game might be good too.

993
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:18,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to discredit that.

994
01:31:18,894 --> 01:31:21,118
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also going to be an upgraded arcade release.

995
01:31:21,459 --> 01:31:22,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool.

996
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:22,461
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

997
01:31:22,581 --> 01:31:24,305
[SPEAKER_01]: With no slowdown and better audio.

998
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:33,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of upgraded arcade releases of a different context, we have the news on the first release in the Arcade Archives 2 series.

999
01:31:33,927 --> 01:31:34,307
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1000
01:31:34,748 --> 01:31:36,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Archives was so big, so much.

1001
01:31:36,889 --> 01:31:38,370
[SPEAKER_03]: They are moving to Arcade Archives 2.

1002
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:39,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1003
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:46,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they need to rebrand with a 2, but I guess because now it's going to be a different selection of hardware that this is going to be on.

1004
01:31:46,935 --> 01:31:49,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So now these are games that will release specifically on Switch 2.

1005
01:31:50,877 --> 01:31:56,738
[SPEAKER_03]: As we've previously seen and confirmed, Arcade Archives 2 for the PlayStation 5.

1006
01:31:57,538 --> 01:31:59,759
[SPEAKER_03]: The first game will be Ridge Racer.

1007
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:01,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love any excuse to say that.

1008
01:32:01,779 --> 01:32:02,699
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the interesting thing.

1009
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:07,320
[SPEAKER_03]: For the PlayStation 4, you still have Arcade Archives Ridge Racer without the 2.

1010
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:13,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if the 2 is supposed to denote maybe a different set of features or what's going on there.

1011
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:18,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess they're saying it's more fun and more user-friendly in Arcade Archives 2.

1012
01:32:19,923 --> 01:32:20,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1013
01:32:20,863 --> 01:32:27,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I'm sure people are excited to hear that it's coming to the PlayStation 5 as well.

1014
01:32:27,428 --> 01:32:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And my assumption was the reason why we were doing an Arcade Archives 2 sort of series was because now maybe like the hardware they're going to emulate is going to be a little bit of a better step.

1015
01:32:37,855 --> 01:32:37,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1016
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:40,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Archives 2, PlayStation 4, Switch 1

1017
01:32:54,339 --> 01:33:02,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch out on Switch, though, because some of those titles that showed up in the doesn't currently work list were arcade archives, but that's not to say the developer won't fix those.

1018
01:33:02,841 --> 01:33:05,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Just know what you're getting into with all that.

1019
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:12,502
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's still really cool about Ridge Racer, the original arcade release being available for the PlayStation 5, as it ought to be.

1020
01:33:14,142 --> 01:33:15,683
[SPEAKER_03]: All things come full circle in the end.

1021
01:33:16,303 --> 01:33:19,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's travel around the world and check out release dates and see what's coming full circle this week.

1022
01:33:20,364 --> 01:33:22,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, not DarkSakura, Loki first, then we'll do the...

1023
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I can start, I mean shit you know what, fuck it, yeah, UK, UK first you know what, the US doesn't deserve to be first this week, UK first

1033
01:34:40,767 --> 01:34:42,248
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back in the swing of things.

1034
01:34:42,268 --> 01:34:43,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, America, go last.

1035
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:48,013
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo Switch, we have Tokimeki Memorial Forever With You Emotional.

1036
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have that in a regular and a deluxe edition.

1037
01:34:52,717 --> 01:34:54,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's actually the only big release this week.

1038
01:34:54,938 --> 01:34:55,839
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on May 8th.

1039

[SPEAKER_03]: That's...

1040
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,621
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it for Japan on the Switch.

1041
01:34:59,082 --> 01:35:02,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Checking the PlayStation 5 just to see if we're in a similar situation.

1042
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:04,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, still pretty slow.

1043
01:35:04,106 --> 01:35:06,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I thought maybe it would pick up out of Golden Week, but not really.

1044
01:35:06,769 --> 01:35:09,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But a new Tokimeki Memorial game is going to interest some people.

1045
01:35:09,231 --> 01:35:10,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got that.

1046
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:11,913

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1062
01:36:26,473 --> 01:36:30,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have one more news story tonight, and what a shitty note to end on, Loki.

1063
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:41,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, tariffs are affecting everything, and everything includes replica Atari 2600 cartridges.

1064
01:36:42,277 --> 01:36:42,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1065
01:36:43,218 --> 01:36:45,821
[SPEAKER_05]: So Atari has been putting out some...

1066
01:36:47,987 --> 01:37:14,740
[SPEAKER_05]: replica cartridges I think those are 2600 plus they did recently 2600 plus so of course they wanted to share that tariffs have infected their business and of course with the recent increases they're going to have to raise the price of those cartridges up a bit so the replica cartridges will go from 30 to 33 dollars and then of course

1067
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, I know that there's some that were going up $10 as well.

1068
01:37:19,883 --> 01:37:23,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, all of the accessories are going up by $5.

1069
01:37:23,445 --> 01:37:29,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all things considered, that's not a huge price increase, but it's the principle, right?

1070
01:37:29,349 --> 01:37:30,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just... Oh, I'm sorry.

1071
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I read that it's $10.

1072
01:37:32,551 --> 01:37:32,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 10%, so $3.

1073
01:37:32,991 --> 01:37:33,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1074
01:37:33,511 --> 01:37:35,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But still.

1075
01:37:35,192 --> 01:37:36,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, I mean, it's everything.

1076
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:37,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1077
01:37:37,774 --> 01:37:38,835
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that money going to?

1078
01:37:39,994 --> 01:37:50,890
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it's just it's going to yeah the cost of those things there's a uh it's not the food and drug administration like it's not necessarily the games industry but there's a great um

1079
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gosh, there's... I don't know if it was ReviewTech.

1080
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:12,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the tech channels, GamersNexus, did an in-depth piece on the whole tariff situation and how it's affecting PC parts manufacturers and system integrators and stuff like that.

1081
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And talking about kind of...

1082
01:38:16,255 --> 01:38:18,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Just how ridiculous it is.

1083
01:38:18,782 --> 01:38:23,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these larger companies obviously are going to be able to absorb this, but smaller companies...

1084
01:38:24,178 --> 01:38:49,800
[SPEAKER_05]: they just may go out of business and it really gets down into the details like there's some of these companies where they're talking about like we manufacture this PC case and like we're going to be fully transparent here's all the costs here's the cost of the tariffs here's all of this stuff here's what we would have to mark this up to to even make a profit on it like we are making we are losing money on these essentially so it's a very interesting piece

1085
01:38:52,188 --> 01:38:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, we'll see.

1086
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:59,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and then who knows, maybe, you know, Dear Leader changes his mind tomorrow, so we'll see what happens.

1087
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, as Joe and Matt says, elections have consequences.

1088
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:04,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we know.

1089
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:05,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We sadly, sadly know.

1090
01:39:07,592 --> 01:39:09,254
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:39:30,516 --> 01:39:34,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is an excuse for me to pick it back up because I think they did release a new set as well.

1092
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:36,801
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's like, oh God, am I going to be too far behind?

1093
01:39:37,241 --> 01:39:37,542
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1094
01:39:37,582 --> 01:39:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry if I stopped liking all your stuff in that game, but I literally stopped checking it like maybe three weeks ago or whenever that shiny set came out and I was getting shitty pulls every single day.

1095
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:54,214
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send your future emails if you want.

1096
01:39:55,075 --> 01:39:57,337
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I'm going to check with Loki on any last minute stories.

1097
01:39:59,242 --> 01:39:59,462
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1098
01:39:59,882 --> 01:40:01,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1099
01:40:01,763 --> 01:40:05,625
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a big week, but I think we hit on all the big stuff already.

1100
01:40:05,705 --> 01:40:07,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see what the coming days bring.

1101
01:40:07,725 --> 01:40:11,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, believe it or not, we're like a month out from Summer Game Fest and all that news.

1102
01:40:11,647 --> 01:40:13,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Switch 2 is released.

1103
01:40:13,948 --> 01:40:17,009
[SPEAKER_05]: The year has gone by so fast and yet so slow.

1104
01:40:17,049 --> 01:40:22,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That Switch 2, like the way Nintendo is releasing hardware on an accelerated timetable is wild.

1105
01:40:22,991 --> 01:40:23,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But we look forward to that.

1106
01:40:24,132 --> 01:40:24,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1107
01:40:25,012 --> 01:40:27,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well with that, we're going to do some final thoughts and wrap it up.

1108
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:30,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1109
01:40:30,055 --> 01:40:33,097
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1110
01:40:33,698 --> 01:40:41,783
[SPEAKER_03]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube or wherever you found this show going an awful long way.

1111
01:40:41,863 --> 01:40:42,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell a friend.

1112
01:40:42,963 --> 01:40:43,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Help us spread the word.

1113
01:40:43,764 --> 01:40:44,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more voices here.

1114
01:40:44,945 --> 01:40:45,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1115
01:40:46,886 --> 01:40:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get the final thoughts.

1116
01:40:47,947 --> 01:40:51,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming you are... We're done nice and early tonight, Jamie, so I'm assuming you're streaming tonight.

1117
01:40:52,503 --> 01:40:52,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am.

1118
01:40:53,164 --> 01:40:53,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1119
01:40:54,425 --> 01:40:55,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to do some Dead by Daylight.

1120
01:40:55,926 --> 01:40:56,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do some Killer.

1121
01:40:56,907 --> 01:40:57,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

1122
01:40:57,988 --> 01:40:58,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.

1123
01:40:58,608 --> 01:40:59,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.

1124
01:40:59,509 --> 01:40:59,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

1125
01:41:01,011 --> 01:41:02,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, final thought.

1126
01:41:02,812 --> 01:41:03,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought.

1127
01:41:04,354 --> 01:41:04,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Ow.

1128
01:41:05,334 --> 01:41:05,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, feel better.

1129
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:10,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing three ballet classes effectively a week is kind of owie.

1130
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:12,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1131
01:41:12,921 --> 01:41:13,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

1132
01:41:14,883 --> 01:41:16,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought for us tonight.

1133
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:26,246
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I am excited to get this Retroid Pocket Flip 2 fully ready to go.

1134
01:41:27,107 --> 01:41:28,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Setting up emulators is hard.

1135
01:41:30,928 --> 01:41:34,271
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is... Oh, real quick, I was going to say, sorry.

1136
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:42,458
[SPEAKER_05]: One disappointing thing, though, is I probably will not be able to get the dream of playing Final Fantasy XI offline on that thing.

1137
01:41:42,959 --> 01:41:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's so complicated to do it.

1138
01:41:45,702 --> 01:41:47,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's so incredibly complicated.

1139
01:41:48,044 --> 01:41:52,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And now with the servers being shut down and everything, good luck getting your system updates.

1140
01:41:52,808 --> 01:41:54,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you do that?

1141
01:41:55,311 --> 01:41:55,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1142
01:41:56,052 --> 01:41:57,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do the desktop one easier?

1143
01:41:57,872 --> 01:41:58,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll do that.

1144
01:41:58,753 --> 01:42:00,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be the desktop version.

1145
01:42:00,733 --> 01:42:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the PC version.

1146
01:42:01,913 --> 01:42:03,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So emulating the PC version.

1147
01:42:04,274 --> 01:42:15,196
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard to find a modded launcher that isn't specifically made for just one server.

1148
01:42:15,856 --> 01:42:17,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that is available for everything.

1149
01:42:18,997 --> 01:42:19,557
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not.

1150
01:42:21,138 --> 01:42:21,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1151
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:22,718
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very complicated.

1152
01:42:23,186 --> 01:42:31,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, Square just needs to release a Final Fantasy XI new version that's playable offline already, but they probably won't.

1153
01:42:31,507 --> 01:42:35,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, my final thought is Claire Obscure, Expedition 33, I'm coming for you this week, finally.

1154
01:42:35,888 --> 01:42:37,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taken me way too long to get to.

1155
01:42:38,409 --> 01:42:43,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, I had such a good time in LA this last couple days.

1156
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, I was talking this through with my friend Victoria, who I used to do a podcast with, and one of these days I'd love to do a podcast with her again.

1157
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:52,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I think, I think

1158
01:42:52,851 --> 01:42:59,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan and I went so hard on Disney for so many years that it kind of ruined the SoCal trips for us for a while.

1159
01:42:59,296 --> 01:43:00,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we burned out.

1160
01:43:00,457 --> 01:43:01,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say ruined.

1161
01:43:01,137 --> 01:43:01,798
[SPEAKER_03]: We burned out.

1162
01:43:01,978 --> 01:43:03,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing was wrong, per se.

1163
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:03,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It just got expensive.

1164
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got burned out doing other stuff.

1165
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:09,684
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that we got to go this last week, I'm definitely going to come to LA more often.

1166
01:43:10,405 --> 01:43:11,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll go to the Game Awards finally this year.

1167
01:43:12,026 --> 01:43:13,167
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1168
01:43:14,748 --> 01:43:15,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I love Kylie Minogue.

1169
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:16,809
[SPEAKER_03]: She's incredible.

1170
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:18,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan Kylie Minogue.

1171
01:43:18,571 --> 01:43:19,772
[SPEAKER_03]: She's unproblematic and fun.

1172
01:43:20,072 --> 01:43:20,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good night, everybody.

1173
01:43:20,993 --> 01:43:21,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1174
01:43:23,652 --> 01:43:26,093
