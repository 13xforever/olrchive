10037	16760	Anyone who knew me before about 2016 would probably agree that my being a Luddite about new popular technology is extremely atypical.
17081	23884	For me to have literally lived technology for my entire life to be so aghast at the most recent significant uses of it is entirely unexpected.
24184	28686	I've come to realize that it's because tech stopped being a form of artistic design and started from principles of business.
28926	31508	How else could you come up with literally making up money?
32659	33802	What does this have to do with gaming?
45396	47818	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
47838	52281	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
52421	57025	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again.
57465	64891	Tonight, May the 18th of 2025 with episode number 1047 of our show.
65812	75259	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm not joined tonight, unfortunately, by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but I am joined once again tonight with Techmaster Lo,
75779	76180	Hi Loki!
76500	76800	Hello.
76960	77501	How are you doing?
78462	79262	I'm pretty good.
79683	85268	So this is interesting because you were off last week, now Jamie's off this week, but how was your week off?
87069	87690	It was fine.
89211	93675	Our kids have a yearly piano recital they do, so we did that.
94355	97198	And normally it's earlier in the day, but you know.
97915	98536	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
114774	115314	DarkSakura.com
134464	144209	Going to our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
144349	147471	And Mike Deft in chat says, Rob can have next week off.
147891	150292	No, I will be here next week.
150352	154154	But the week I will take off, let me tell you, I'm just going to tell you now.
155195	166008	There's been some other things going on, so we didn't get a chance, and I'll address that in a minute, but I didn't get a chance to talk about this on Bobby's show tonight, but I will be going back to Atlanta on June 22nd.
166168	168852	So this is not the DragonCon trip.
169312	170974	This is a second trip.
171074	173437	I'm doing two trips to Atlanta this year because...
174218	200975	I will be going to the Southern Fried Gaming Expo once again which I went to a couple years ago and I had a lot of fun but I didn't make it back last year just because you know going to Atlanta twice a year is a lot but you know what I said let's do it let's do it again and they're kind enough to have me back and Bobby back and VOG Network is sponsoring it but we're also going to be doing a panel which we'll tell you more about later when that's all announced
201175	201815	Deft, Deft, Deft, Deft
218177	222979	The show itself is actually mostly the 20th and 21st, Friday and Saturday.
223399	232103	Technically, it runs Sunday, but like a lot of conventions that run through, the last day is kind of duncey by like 2 o'clock.
233344	238006	That's probably not the actual ending, but as far as things to do, it's dunceys by 2 o'clock.
238706	245469	I'm actually taking a flight out on Sunday this year, which I was too afraid to do my first year, but this year I was like, nah, I'll have plenty of time to get to the airport.
245669	246789	and do all that stuff.
247170	248690	So I'm flying back on Sunday.
250091	251211	But excited about that.
251391	253572	Yeah, Bobby says it's actually earlier in the year this year.
253672	255032	Oh, that was the other big thing.
255112	255673	That's why.
256193	260034	Usually this show is in July and it's almost too close to DragonCon.
260894	263995	It's literally like six weeks apart.
264776	273739	But this year it's in June because the MLB All-Star game is the normal weekend and where this hotel is is like it's
274119	277601	There's a little walking path that walks you over the freeway.
277941	281943	And once you walk over the freeway, bam, you're at the Atlanta Braves headquarters.
282003	286965	You're at their new stadium and the whole little shopping village and restaurant stuff that's all in that area.
287345	294708	So this hotel is huge for that because the MLB All-Star is going to be happening over there.
294748	296409	So obviously, you don't want that to happen the same weekend.
296649	298170	But I'm really excited to show up.
300055	301135	on that weekend.
301155	304758	And yes, Bobby says Southern Pride Game Expo is an away weekend for the Braves.
305118	306840	So none of that will be getting in the way.
307340	307701	Excellent.
308041	315186	It's like I have to, you know, Loki, I have to plan my walking now around the freaking not Oakland A's.
316027	319348	Because I walk around that stadium in West Sacramento.
319408	320948	It's Sutter Health Park, I think it's called.
322188	325069	Historically, there's a nice little river walk there.
325409	329690	I love to walk down there and get all the Pokestops or Ingress or Pikmin, whatever's going on.
329730	331910	There's a lot of nice Pikmin mushrooms and stuff.
332290	334931	And so I love to walk that path and around.
335251	338432	The stadium being there has been great for getting a stadium Pikmin.
338632	342632	And there's a dessert thing right towards the front, so I get my dessert Pikmin from there.
342973	344713	So anyway, it's a great route, except now...
345413	345913	Terrible.
346213	352756	Because now that the not Oakland A's are also not being called the Sacramento A's, but they're just A's.
352936	354237	They're just the A's.
354597	357478	Except if you looked at their scorecard, they'd be getting F's.
357779	361360	But the A's play in that same stadium now.
361700	365562	And so like parking is always a mess and people, it's just, it's a mess.
366262	366623	It's a mess.
367143	369024	So I don't walk there as much as I used to.
369624	372725	But, you know, it was nice when it lasted.
374526	376768	What's the game playing behind you tonight, Loki?
377268	382212	Because, of course, when we tape live at VOG, we have a fun little game that usually plays behind Loki.
383993	387616	It was a game I used to play a bunch on the PlayStation 2.
388276	392720	It's kind of like a... Actually, no, I think this is the original PlayStation.
393560	394401	Maybe it was PlayStation 2.
394441	394821	I don't remember.
395061	400385	One of the PlayStations, it is called Rogue Trip Vacation 2012.
400585	403768	It's like a Twisted Metal type game.
404130	409633	Yeah, I can tell it's very, um, like, shooty bang bang with cars, but that looks like my jam, that looks like fun.
410033	412895	I don't think I played that, but, uh, it looks fun.
413115	428244	Yeah, it's, it's, imagine, like, god, like, yeah, it's on PlayStation 1, so imagine, like, a Twisted Metal game with, like, like, 90, like, it's not Ska, but it's, like, kind of that, like,
430001	431802	That music that was popular around the time.
431903	435927	That upbeat pop ska, like the one Mighty Mighty Boston song that was popular.
435947	437528	Yeah, like Mighty Mighty Boston type stuff.
437669	441332	It's like, imagine that as a soundtrack in that game.
441432	443555	Like, it's kind of weird.
444135	446578	Essentially, the premise is that you're...
448924	455228	There's this super rich guy, I almost think of Biff Tannen in the alternate Back to the Future timeline.
455488	467094	He's got all these big pleasure vacation spots for the ultra rich, but for everybody else, you can't access it unless you hire some of these rogue...
469099	470040	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
485612	486413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
499997	500778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
518670	522973	And I could tell because when you look at controls, it's still a little picture of a PlayStation controller.
523253	526715	And I was like, ah, it is the PlayStation versions that they put on Evercade.
527055	528856	But those are actually on sale.
529937	534560	I think they were only – I think the cartridge – I say they because it's three in the cartridge.
534580	535740	I think the cartridge was only $13.
535820	539423	There's a big sale going on on Woot right now, which –
540103	547245	The last time I bought something on Woot was over a decade ago because like Amazon bought them and they basically became like, you know, an arm of Amazon.
547785	553887	But somebody, it was going around social media that, hey, there's a big sale on Woot right now.
554167	556748	And I peeked at one of the screenshots.
556768	558829	I'm like, is that the Tomb Raider Evercade cartridge?
558849	559469	And sure enough, it was.
559489	560289	It was only 13 bucks.
560589	561970	And I was like, hell yeah, I'm going to pick that up.
562570	563770	So I'm always looking for deals.
563810	565391	Lots and lots of t-shirts from there.
565851	587747	yeah that's it Woot used to be like the t-shirt place and I looked you could actually see your like order history the last time I bought something from Woot was in 2013 and what I bought was that Tron mouse for the movie for Tron Legacy remember that mouse I used to have that would actually light up through the USB and make the little noises oh it was awesome that was like my favorite mouse uh
587807	588047	DarkSakura,
602374	606797	We're going to get to our gaming headlines, our kickoff topic, our gaming weeks, and all that good stuff.
607257	609559	I have to start off with something tonight, though, that's very important.
609959	624690	It's not directly gaming-related, and I have to put out a little bit of a trigger warning because, unfortunately, another member of the OL Army or our VOG Discord, our VOG fam, passed away.
625591	627652	And this is extremely unexpected.
628833	630295	A really good friend of the show.
630815	638881	I know you and Jamie didn't know this guy so well, but you guys would have really liked him if you'd ever been able to go to DragonCon or any of that and hang out with this guy.
639061	647068	His name was VO by Kurt, or Kurt was his name, but he came into chat and you probably had seen him in chat if you ever came to a live show.
647508	650430	Once in a while he would drop in and his name was VO by Kurt and I...
651431	651872	VoB Kurt, VoB Kurt
671773	674895	and by the way, that was a terrible, terrible impression.
675355	679879	You can actually see his content if you want to see what he looked like and hear his voice.
680139	681380	He was very good with TikTok.
682360	689406	I learned a lot about making TikTok work from him because he was one of the first people that came to the DragonCon event
690812	697978	I keep wanting to say podcasting track, but digital media track that actually was mildly successful on TikTok at the time.
698718	708266	And what he did is he had a channel where he called, I think his name on TikTok is still VO by Kurt, but the name that would show up was The Fat Guy.
708766	717151	He was a larger guy for a while and he started getting in the habit of walking all the time and he started going to the gym and he would post these updates.
717572	722755	Well, after 365 days a year, he lost a lot of weight.
723095	723515	A lot.
723696	727838	Like, you know, I remember seeing him at Dragon Con, you know, in more recent years after he lost the weight.
727878	729019	And it's like, what do you?
729019	730640	What are you going to do with the fat guy?
730660	732901	Because that's not really going to work anymore, Kurt.
733402	736444	And so he rebranded as The Fit Guy.
737164	739426	And he continued his walking adventures and so forth.
739446	743968	So he had a little pocket of fans on Fitness TikTok.
744709	745349	I was one of them.
745709	748471	I loved hearing about his stories.
748531	750432	It was very motivational.
751493	757037	Unfortunately, I got news on Monday that he was struck by a car while he was walking.
758659	765429	and there's a whole little news report that was run on it and the driver that hit him was allegedly drunk driving.
767331	769394	On a Sunday morning, mind you, um...
771007	778931	which I'm going to be very restrained because I want to have a nice moment to remember Kurt but you know I have words for you.
779812	798982	I don't think anybody out there that is of sound mind exactly endorses driving under the influence but this just goes to show that driving under the influence is a serious thing and if you have a friend that's attempting to do it or you know somebody that's done it or trying to pass it off or something like that then don't
800043	800383	Do that.
800503	806245	Oh, and Bobby is saying that I'm glad I used the word alleged because Bobby is now saying it might have been a medical episode.
806665	808686	So it could have been that sort of the influence.
808786	811067	Perhaps the court documents have been sealed.
811207	811807	All right, then.
812427	814108	Then that is what is the original one.
814308	820030	The original news story I saw was lending itself more to, you know, the other situation.
820170	821870	But fine.
822410	823511	What I said is not.
824151	825333	and DarkSakura.com.
841125	851468	Allen and I were walking downtown playing Pikmin Bloom, getting our steps in, planting flowers, because when we walk together, we get a lot of the big flowers to hatch, which is a thing in Pikmin Blue.
852129	854789	The event going on right now in Pikmin Bloom is right up my alley.
854849	856790	It's classic Nintendo controller Pikmin.
857230	865753	It's the first time I've paid for a season pass, because I want to make sure I get all those stinking Pikmin with Nintendo controllers and Famicom controllers and Game of Watches and stuff.
866073	868054	So Allen and I walked a good 10,000 steps downtown, and
869694	876982	and then came home and, you know, Bobby was good enough to leave me a message that said, hey, you might want to be sitting down when you check Discord.
877342	880465	And of course, my mind goes to, oh, great, we're getting canceled.
880525	881146	What did we do?
881586	886251	That's because you don't think that this is the other is going to be the case, what you're going to read.
886331	892137	And so, you know, we pull up what's going on and hear that Kurt was struck by a vehicle.
893038	893798	while walking.
894559	906344	And it's really a moment of shock because literally was just doing the same thing, the same thing in a similar place that Kurt was doing on Sunday morning.
907465	911947	And Kurt was a Pikmin Bloom player off and on, but he was in an on phase.
912567	914768	He'd sent me what we call a mushroom.
914808	916449	You can radio people into mushrooms.
916469	921712	You use the little thing and really, he sent me a mushroom request on Sunday morning.
922782	946513	so I know he was playing Pikmin Bloom and so I'm just it's very very like haunted and what's what's really difficult like it's part of like all this like processing and stuff is that if you actually go and you watch his last TikTok which came up organically in my feed last night on my For You page his last TikTok came up
947492	958304	And he actually says in his last TikTok, he's talking, he's like, yep, I was out walking, I was getting my steps in today, walking around, and well, I actually had two cars stop and wave me by.
958625	959926	That was a really nice thing.
959966	964812	He said, I guess that's all I can ask for is not getting struck by a vehicle or something like that.
964932	967394	Like, almost like it's like...
968669	973833	It's very difficult to hear, knowing what happened the next day after he recorded that.
974894	983260	So I'm sorry if that's a little uncomfortable for people to hear, but that's a lot of the thoughts that we're sitting here processing.
983781	992948	To hear that somebody who potentially should not have had control of a vehicle, allegedly, was behind a vehicle and...
995305	996346	Thank you for watching!
1020834	1025539	Yeah, he had his own podcast about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
1026120	1027161	He had a co-host on the show.
1027281	1032186	I shouldn't say it was his podcast, but him and his buddy did a show called This Week at MCU.
1032626	1039173	And yeah, I know Bobby already told you about this quick peek behind the curtain, but there were times we were talking about bringing that show to VOG.
1039834	1043938	And so that also hits very, very close to home.
1044699	1046180	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1062611	1063472	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1088107	1090570	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1105645	1113788	and obviously Kurt's family, both biological and chosen through DragonCon are deeply in my thoughts this week.
1113828	1125552	His co-host at another show that he was on called Wise and Nerdy, which I hadn't mentioned yet, but with Charles and Joe, I know they did a big show, kind of a tribute earlier this week.
1126312	1131994	And I know they're having to process too and, you know, move on.
1132054	1132294	And it's,
1133614	1133995	It's hard.
1134535	1138418	So anyway, I don't know what else to say.
1139659	1145384	Words escape me on matters like these, but I hope Kurt's family knows that I'm thinking about them.
1146725	1152589	And it's going to be one of those glaring things that's missing at DragonCon this year.
1153250	1154931	Now, Kurt had missed DragonCon before.
1155031	1157713	He wasn't there every year, but he was there most years that I was there.
1158154	1159455	We'd done panels together and stuff.
1160918	1164741	That absence is going to be felt this year, and it's going to be difficult.
1165942	1177552	So pouring one out metaphorically for Kurt, and we'll continue my walks in his honor as the daily TikToks would have reminded me to do.
1179573	1182136	Okay, let's try to move on.
1183089	1196893	I know, difficult transition, difficult topic, but we're going to move on and do what we do here, which was talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and all of that coming to a head this week with our kickoff topic tonight.
1196933	1200754	Loki, why don't you tell us all about this thing that nobody asked for?
1202964	1208666	Yeah, so I don't know why it's like this, but it is like this.
1210006	1218129	So apparently, in this current season of Fortnite, there is a new Darth Vader AI...
1219213	1244449	A player that basically has a digital recreation of James Earl Jones' voice but it's powered by a large language model so you can interact with it via voice chat and ask it things and talk to it and do stuff and then it then responds back to you like James Earl Jones was responding back to you.
1244549	1246971	The problem is because it is a large language model
1247970	1251852	So basically, it's like two filters.
1252272	1253213	You say something.
1253533	1255794	So you go like, you know, hello, Space Daddy.
1256134	1258415	And that's going to go to chat GPT to formulate.
1258475	1261657	Pretend you are Darth Vader, you know, whatever large language model you're using.
1261877	1265019	Pretend you are Darth Vader and respond to the comment, hello, Space Daddy.
1265359	1267060	And then that response...
1267620	1268801	Well, they might be reaching
1282952	1305535	considering that but and then that response so you know you say hello space daddy and then the response comes out in the James Earl Jones voice I am not your father or whatever the thing is going to say from chat GBT which again I don't know why we need this in Fortnite it feels like the type of thing where it's like because we can but anyway go ahead Loki I'll pop off in a minute so
1306764	1319734	So this basically gives you responses that are either A, seem to fit like Darth Vader, B, are just silly responses, and C, are just
1321164	1322564	Offensive, I guess.
1323945	1327626	So of course, because it is a large language model, it's easy to manipulate.
1327886	1330086	So people have already gotten it to say slurs.
1330587	1331867	They've gotten it to swear.
1332207	1334308	They've gotten it to say racist things.
1334948	1336148	Because of course they would.
1336448	1337849	Because of course that's what happens.
1338709	1342490	This is the future of gaming if we are going to
1343190	1365448	further leverage AI models without any sort of filtering on there I mean there are some things where it kind of pushes back but it also is easy to get around all of that um I don't know I've now heard James Earl Jones say Hawk Tua so that's a thing and um well let's be clear you didn't hear him say it
1369011	1394250	The interesting thing about this, and by the way, those clips with the slurs and all that other stuff, minutes, minutes after this thing is released, 30 minutes to an hour after this is released, the TikToks are up, the YouTubes are up, the people trying to farm the engagement with these hideous things that they are able to manipulate the AI into saying, even though it's not supposed to be saying those things, but oh my God, it turns out AI isn't perfect.
1394750	1396652	Yeah, look at that Or says things that could be offensive Right
1412210	1414072	This is what you want, Loki.
1414372	1415153	This is what you want.
1415213	1415914	Don't you want this?
1415954	1416494	You want this.
1416534	1417916	Don't you want in your video games?
1418236	1422160	You want to go to NPCs and villages and they're going to all respond with AI.
1422380	1424001	They're going to talk right back to you.
1424021	1427084	They're going to talk to you the way you would want it because it's you.
1427405	1428866	It's a you customized experience.
1428926	1430027	That's what gamers want.
1431314	1460014	so necessarily it's not a bad thing the problem is the way that this is implemented like most things when it comes to like ooh look at how fancy and cool we're gonna use those buzzwords and stuff it's half-assed in the sense that they didn't put enough guardrails on they didn't put enough like just enough to keep it within the context of you know this character and stuff to actually act like this character
1460467	1475320	I wouldn't have a problem with AI-driven NPCs if it essentially has the knowledge of the universe that you're in and isn't necessarily going to respond to external weird things like that.
1476341	1479024	Kind of treat it like a Ren Faire, if you will.
1479044	1483187	Like when you're talking to people at a Ren Faire and you mention your cell phone, they're like, whoa, what's that?
1483247	1483468	You know?
1483928	1486430	What is this fangled magical thing that you talk about?
1486490	1487591	Like, you know, something like that.
1487931	1489512	That would make more sense to me.
1490033	1503242	But, you know, when you have him, when someone's asking him about Pride Month, and he's like, Pride Month, a fleeting celebration of identity, a particular concept, apprentice that you would seek my approval on such matter, very well, continue to cling to your delusions.
1503522	1503983	Thanks!
1504363	1505204	Thanks, Fortnite!
1505484	1506805	That sounds like inclusiveness.
1507245	1508606	Let's see what you do in June.
1508646	1510888	I'm sure you're going to be flying the Pride flag.
1510928	1513691	And AI doesn't understand the concept of Pride Month.
1513791	1520937	That sounds like a response to pride, not in an LGBT context, but in a context of the word itself.
1521037	1527022	And that's the problem, is that, oh my god, with these AI, you mean they don't understand context?
1527262	1527503	What?
1529249	1530510	No shit, everybody!
1531510	1538395	Yet they're trying to shove this shit down our throats like this is a completely baked thing that's ready for primetime that is what we want.
1538695	1542857	And I love y'all in chat are bringing up a lot of things that have already happened in gaming.
1543458	1549461	SGO100Matt says, we have the classic clip from Seaman, the Dreamcast game of I'll friend your butt.
1549722	1555845	Of course, that was the human talking back to the AI, but you know, there was that whole thing.
1556206	1558387	This is taking it to the worst level because we can't have nice things.
1558707	1568591	And plus, I think the whole point of Seaman was the ludicrousness of that whole game and that whole situation where it's like, literally nobody asked for this in fucking Fortnite Battle Royale.
1568671	1570412	Why is this in Fortnite Battle Royale?
1571573	1573613	Is Seaman swearing and stuff?
1573673	1576435	No, it's not because ironically enough, that was accomplished on the console.
1576475	1578155	It doesn't know how to say those words.
1578936	1579376	Exactly.
1579656	1583139	Well, and also, and before y'all jump in to the why, I do know the why.
1583679	1585680	Fortnite wants to be more than Fortnite.
1585720	1587442	Fortnite wants to be pop culture.
1587502	1590404	Fortnite is a gaming system.
1590904	1594447	Because what we all call Fortnite, the game, is really Fortnite Battle Royale.
1594787	1599991	Because now you have Fortnite Lego, you have Fortnite, the rock band thing.
1600291	1603833	You have Fortnite, you know, Fortnite Battle Royale is really the game that everybody calls Fortnite.
1603853	1605715	But Fortnite is really that...
1606135	1613078	Trojan Horse of a gaming system because it's on PlayStation, it's on Xbox, it's just not on Apple, but that's for a whole other reason.
1614118	1616259	That's a whole other thing that happened this week.
1616279	1628483	The AI is basically using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model and then also the Generator Response 11 Labs Flash version 2.5 model to create the audio.
1628664	1630584	I've used 11 Labs, so I understand what that's about.
1630604	1632385	That's basically a text-to-speech engine
1633185	1661514	um that you can do the change or to get it to read in in that voice um yeah I'm sorry I'm laughing at chat Dolly Partners in chat hello hello saying well or should I say howdy partner uh says Fortnite Battle Latrice Royale yeah now that's that's a character I would love to get read by an AI drag queen no I don't I shouldn't be giving gaming I'm just like no I want I want an actual drag queen to record voice lines and be paid for it that's
1662154	1672777	I want Latrice Royale to make some coins by, you know, get those nuts out of my face by recording those types of lines and actually having them in the game without necessarily being generated.
1672797	1673277	That's what I want.
1673637	1689142	Which on that note, when we talk about voice actors and actresses, the one thing from this is that I really feel like Fortnite just gave the striking actors and actresses and folks a gift in their ongoing dispute
1690635	1712628	ongoing dispute it's been a fucking year almost maybe 10 months it's been a fucking year i i i really am looking down the possibility of going to a second dragon dragon con and drag con too sure i've actually never been a drag con i'd love to go someday but i'm on the possibility of a second dragon con
1713772	1729341	where certain voice actors are not going to be able to openly promote their games they can answer questions about but they can't openly promote their games because there is still a strike going on with basic AI protections and in my opinion Fortnite just handed SAG-AFTRA the biggest gift
1730191	1733394	about what these actors are exactly trying to prevent.
1733734	1740300	And all they have to do is get the sizzle reel of Darth Vader saying all those slurs and their point can be made.
1740360	1742382	Yes, I know James Earl Jones signed.
1742802	1744143	I know the family signed.
1744403	1750088	But I'm going to hypothesize something, allegedly, to cover my ass.
1750188	1751810	Allegedly, I would...
1752964	1776999	Gander hypothesize that he was told this was the vision your AI is going to be you the AI on your voice is so Darth Vader as a character can continue in another trilogy can continue in these movies and if you sign on the dotted line then you know what that character Darth Vader will get to be explored by a whole new generation and that same iconic voice that you helped build will
1777139	1780460	We'll be able to use AI to keep that voice going to a whole new generation.
1780960	1787141	And if you look at some of the quotes that James Earl Jones and the estate said as to why they signed on it, it really is in line with that.
1787162	1794303	That he was given one vision and then, psych, oh, well, it kind of opened it up for this too.
1794983	1800625	And I would bet if James Earl Jones saw the sizzle reel of himself using these types of slurs...
1801658	1804759	I don't think he would have been as quick to sign on the dotted line, nor the family.
1804819	1810542	And I wonder if that whole thing doesn't get somehow renegotiated or court.
1811282	1813303	We could be sitting at the beginning of something here.
1814723	1815244	But we'll see.
1815364	1816944	We'll see where that goes, because I don't know.
1816984	1818705	Those contracts can also be pretty ironclad.
1819025	1823367	But I just I hypothesize he didn't fucking know that this was what was going to happen.
1823447	1830270	Well, yeah, I think if they I'm pretty sure that in these clauses that they have some sort of like thing, if it disparages his.
1831575	1832576	Legacy, I guess.
1832977	1839187	That would probably have some sort of poison pill clause or something like that where they can basically...
1840751	1842232	Terminate the contract or something.
1842852	1846655	I don't know, but it doesn't feel like that they've been too much.
1846735	1857762	SAG-AFTRA needs to have that thing on their iPad and next time they go to the negotiating table, just whip that out and throw it on the table and say, this is exactly why you are not going to have these AI clauses and contracts.
1858303	1859343	No further discussion.
1859683	1861385	And we will not resolve this until...
1862245	1867312	This has been going on for a year.
1867412	1876783	This should have been an easy thing to figure out, but the gaming industry is just screaming, crying, holding on to this.
1878257	1881278	because they want Darth Vader to be able to say slurs.
1881398	1883059	At least that's what it's starting to feel like.
1883539	1889721	The more the gaming companies are resisting this whole thing and not signing and agreeing to SAG-AFTRA's terms on this whole thing.
1890281	1894863	Well, just think of like they continue to do this with other celebrity characters.
1894883	1898324	So you could have like, you know, Ariana Grande saying slurs.
1898364	1901366	You could have, you know, Peter Griffin saying slurs.
1901386	1905247	There's so many characters that they could voice to have them say slurs.
1905527	1907771	To be clear, Ariana Grande can use the F-slur.
1907811	1909253	Just I'm going to give her that permission card.
1909273	1910515	No, I'm kidding.
1910555	1910875	I'm kidding.
1911356	1912017	It's not okay.
1912177	1915462	No, and that stuff should not show up in games because people will use that for bad things.
1916023	1918327	So just...
1919838	1946237	it's it's yeah but this is this like really y'all this is what game companies truly believe this is what the the tech people in Silicon Valley and beyond the tech circles they gas themselves up with this shit they they all smell each other's farts around how wonderful AI is going to be they all just inhale nothing but AI fart about how great this is going to be for the industry and
1946477	1951641	and how this is going to be so good for games and how, oh, it's going to be a customized experience.
1952441	1955123	Oh, it smells so good.
1955203	1955724	Sign me up.
1955784	1956504	That's great.
1957465	1960747	This is what the industry is gassing themselves up on, literally.
1961828	1962349	Meanwhile...
1964119	1966800	Meanwhile, here's this little game.
1967201	1969261	Here's this little game called Claire Obscure.
1969862	1971962	Expedition 33 is the game that comes out $50.
1972103	1973643	It's just $50.
1973723	1976384	It was made by a smaller team of people.
1976484	1980646	Sure, they outsourced some of the development, but for the most part, it was made by a team of 30 people.
1981766	1983827	It's got those classic gaming bits.
1984047	1987529	It's really just a really souped up turn-based battle and
1988129	2010633	it's just got a really good story that's right a story a written story by humans that's that's very very good and AI isn't in it and you know what everybody for the most part there's always going to be some people that dislike it but even the people that dislike it understand why other people like it and this game is just turning this game should be turning the entire industry on its head
2012785	2022257	It won't because, again, everybody else is too busy smelling each other's farts to see what's really happening over here with Claire Obscure capturing a lot of gamers' attentions.
2027464	2028025	It's just wild.
2029943	2033065	But yeah, Darth Vader probably won't be the first and won't be the last.
2033105	2036447	But again, why the fuck do we need an AI Vader in Fortnite anyway?
2036867	2038869	Why do you need a... What's he supposed to do?
2038909	2041050	He's supposed to tell you how to play the game or something?
2041330	2054118	Because all I see are the clips of him besides the... The ones that are supposed to be useful Vader AI clips are like, Lady Gaga, we should head over to the east and take out the... It's like... Because Lady Gaga's in Fortnite too, by the way.
2054838	2054978	And...
2057751	2058051	I don't know.
2058112	2061977	It just doesn't seem like... I don't understand what it's supposed to be bringing to the game.
2063899	2072730	I really wish game companies would think more carefully and not listen to the fucking circle jerk that's happening in this industry when it comes to AI because it's just...
2073993	2074653	It's not ready.
2075974	2077735	And this is proof it's not ready.
2077795	2082016	And even when it is ready, it needs to be handled very, very carefully.
2082116	2100584	And if you think AI storytelling is going to replace AI from the soul, from the human soul, which a computer cannot reproduce, I just don't know why people have themselves convinced that that's going to be a better thing.
2101727	2101967	Money.
2102047	2103289	Money is why they have investments.
2103329	2104490	That's why they have themselves convinced.
2104510	2105070	That's the answer.
2106812	2115900	S200 Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, I worry the next major conflict is going to be started because of some deepfake or AI generative thing.
2116261	2123107	I know it's unlikely, but you can't say it's 0%, especially when the simplest guardrails are debated and not taken seriously.
2124362	2134711	Oh, you're talking like a world conflict because our dear leader loves to retweet or whatever you call it when you're on his right wing.
2134751	2135431	Retruth.
2135832	2136873	Whatever the fuck it's called.
2137533	2140596	AI doctored pictures of himself as the Pope and this shit.
2141176	2142057	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2142157	2146460	That's a beautiful way to get Catholics to love you.
2147001	2147862	Love you.
2150206	2155488	Quest Buster in chat says, edgy technology is cool, yo, until it becomes a legal liability.
2155548	2157028	Yeah, tell that to NFTs.
2157348	2158929	How's the NFT market, everybody?
2159849	2161049	How's the NFT market doing?
2161969	2162690	How we doing out there?
2164450	2165631	How's those NFTs that you bought?
2166731	2167651	How are those video games?
2167671	2169492	Remember how NFTs are going to be the next big thing?
2170032	2171552	How's the NFT market in video games?
2174313	2174673	I don't know.
2174773	2176854	Did you all pass out from the gas on that one?
2176874	2177194	Because...
2179818	2180338	She died.
2185260	2188242	Anyway, DarkTitsia says, all my apes gone.
2188322	2190763	Oh yeah, what happened to the shitty AI apes art?
2191083	2191843	What happened to all that?
2191883	2196025	What happened to the shitty monkeys over on Twitter and all the artwork?
2196325	2198406	What happened to those NFT things?
2199026	2200027	How much are they worth now?
2203768	2205169	Interesting thing aside.
2207376	2209237	You remember when they were going to ban TikTok?
2209397	2215020	And I don't know, I guess they still could because it depends what side of the bed Dear Leader wakes up on tomorrow morning.
2215080	2221384	But you remember when they were going to ban TikTok and these different alternatives started showing up?
2221524	2226986	One of them is Skylight Social, which runs off of the app protocol, which runs Blue Sky.
2227046	2229268	It runs off of that engine and is...
2230188	2230909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2251842	2252622	Sounds kind of interesting.
2252642	2253463	I'm going to get up on that.
2253863	2255063	Well, finally, what are we at?
2255083	2263626	Like four months later, that app, and you're going to find out in a minute why I'm not naming it, that app finally came out of beta, and I was actually able to dive in and look around.
2263666	2265366	Then I was like, wait a minute.
2265526	2265847	Wait a minute.
2265867	2266267	I'm sorry.
2266987	2271468	They're going to pay you a new cryptocurrency that they're developing?
2272369	2275830	You say creators are going to earn this cryptocurrency?
2275850	2275930	Yeah.
2276750	2282257	that belongs to the app, and that, that, Loki, is the money you're gonna make off the app.
2283646	2284186	PlayMoney.
2284466	2291510	We're going to pay you in Monopoly money, except it's branded by our company, so it's actually worth something.
2291550	2292990	I was reading through the marketing thing.
2293371	2295011	Of course, I'd already signed up.
2295031	2302375	I'm reading through all the marketing thing, and it's like, unlike other platforms, we have freedom of speech, which I'm like, that's a dog whistle.
2302795	2303836	That's a dog whistle.
2303996	2304936	I was like, you know what?
2305637	2309959	Maybe I'm not as interested in this as I was when I first signed up for the beta.
2309979	2310679	Yeah.
2310839	2312460	Boy, fool me, though.
2312520	2313000	They got me.
2313081	2313781	They got me, Gal.
2313941	2314942	They got me on that one.
2315822	2318404	What kind of speech are you trying to use?
2319065	2323427	What kind of speech is that that you're trying to use that you can't use on other platforms?
2323487	2323968	I'm curious.
2323988	2325129	Can you elaborate on that?
2325249	2327950	What kind of speech are you wanting to use?
2328171	2333474	It would show a little, you were banned from TikTok type of thing, and they say, we get, we, you know, whatever.
2333974	2336696	PodCulture says, we're signing up just to lock in a username.
2336996	2339478	Yeah, I mean, I got my username, but, like, imagine,
2341239	2349884	Okay, I imagine it would be a similar feeling to somebody signing up for Truth Social or something like that, not realizing what it was.
2351064	2353266	and then... I like the truth.
2355027	2356148	And being social.
2356769	2358150	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
2358930	2360351	Anyway, alright.
2361192	2363394	Sorry if a Discord noise suddenly went off.
2363694	2370920	I had to take myself out of streaming mode to get the camera to work and now it's letting alert noises through, which is lovely.
2371700	2372341	So annoying.
2372621	2376884	Why can't I... I can't even get Discord audio to work right.
2376924	2378185	You think I'm gonna trust AI...
2379326	2379826	in a video.
2379866	2380407	Jesus.
2381207	2382468	Can you get AI to fix?
2382688	2388972	How about AI stops fixing or changing my fucking drivers every time I reinstall Discord or update Discord?
2389232	2390252	Can AI fix that?
2390993	2391953	Stick with the basics.
2392174	2392594	God.
2394635	2394915	All right.
2395075	2396116	Old man ranting complete.
2396176	2397337	Let's talk about our gaming weeks.
2397937	2398217	Fun.
2398257	2399878	Let's talk about some video games we've been playing this week.
2400178	2401079	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2402079	2428455	It was alright, I've been playing around a lot with my Retroid Pocket Flip 2 So it means I've been doing a lot of emulator stuff, or at least some emulator stuff with it But I'm still trying to get some things to work, like Saturn for whatever reason I can't seem to get a lot of the games working But I played a little bit of Crazy Taxi, and that was fun And of course Metal Slug, played through that a bit Contra, and...
2429805	2431526	I'm trying to think what else I played.
2431647	2432447	There was something else.
2434028	2442415	I'm going to check out some of the indie NES games and stuff that I have as well to get in the play some of that.
2442555	2444056	But yeah, fun little device.
2444396	2452182	I still need to try because you can emulate PC on here and it's supposed to be able to run some things.
2452563	2455004	So I'm going to try to see if I can get Skyrim to run.
2456486	2456826	Why not?
2457066	2457466	Why not?
2458752	2459092	Why not?
2459132	2459472	It'd be fun.
2485157	2494465	But what's also cool, though, is I did get a generic Android dock that I think I can plug this into that and actually hook it up to my TV and then just get wireless controllers.
2494826	2498769	So it can be like a whole portable console that you can actually play on your TV and stuff.
2498829	2502472	But yeah, it's still pretty cool how well everything runs.
2502572	2510780	And then, of course, still trying to get main games with hard drives to work correctly, like Gauntlet Legends and that type of stuff.
2511921	2526114	I just, I'm probably setting it up wrong, I had the wrong ROM set or something like that for those types of games, so it's still, I don't know, MAME is confusing, especially when you talk about ROM sets and everything, just to find the right things, but
2526857	2528278	Yeah, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
2528578	2533780	And then, of course, Minecraft, I think I put out an episode this week?
2534020	2534500	Last week?
2534580	2535740	I don't remember now.
2536160	2539602	Put out an episode recently where I did a starter base and everything.
2540362	2543643	Kind of like some ancient jungle area.
2543883	2546364	And then now I am building a new shop.
2547024	2550506	Which, spoilers, it is a Leakley Distinct Cracker Barrel.
2551986	2553367	I thought that was funny.
2553427	2553967	I showed Jamie.
2554397	2558899	pictures of that already but that'll be coming in my next episode alright, nice
2560046	2560286	Great.
2561426	2562427	Let's see, my gaming week.
2562787	2565848	I've been continuing to play Diablo 4 because you all know I love that game.
2565948	2578271	And for whatever reason, even though the season just came out, they decided to run one of their Mother's Blessing events, which increases the experience you get by like 35% and like the gold by half.
2578631	2581532	So it's a really good time to just be farming and trying to level up.
2582172	2586353	I've unlocked Torment 3, which is getting pretty far along.
2587174	2615755	and I think I only have like two pages of the season quest I have almost all the cosmetics unlocked I think I'm just working on the armor which is the most expensive and otherwise yeah making my way through Diablo but I'm ready to slow down I've been going hard on Diablo 4 for a couple weeks now and I'm kind of ready to be done with this season not that it's bad or anything it's just there's other games coming out or games in my backlog I want to take on and you know believe it or not this is really weird to think about but you know we're only like three weeks away from the Switch 2
2616676	2618717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2640208	2646681	It feels like the 3DS launch almost, in a sense, because it doesn't feel like there's a lot of first-party games at launch.
2647302	2647964	It's like one.
2648605	2649968	I mean, granted, there's stuff that's
2650359	2650939	Metroid, maybe?
2677285	2678465	Oh no, Metro Prime 4.
2679166	2684990	Metro Prime 4 is still happening and Pokemon is sort of second party, but yeah, I guess there's still Pokemon Legends.
2685271	2686151	How could I forget about Prime 4?
2686451	2687512	So that is still coming out too.
2687873	2690054	So we have some games that are spaced out.
2690354	2691555	Is Prime 4 out in June?
2692396	2693277	It's not out with the launch.
2693377	2693977	It's out later.
2694157	2694878	I don't think it is either.
2694918	2696599	I think that's coming out a little later.
2697039	2699261	So I would imagine there's still a big holiday game.
2699361	2703424	I would be surprised if Prime is also their big holiday game.
2703484	2704225	It would seem a little...
2704465	2708388	No, I would think Pokemon would be, assuming that's coming out this year.
2709849	2711190	Or something we don't know.
2711290	2713812	Well, how about a fucking Mario platformer already?
2714232	2716214	When was the last time we had a 3D Mario platformer?
2716254	2717835	How many years ago was Odyssey at this point?
2717855	2718636	It was a long time ago.
2718656	2722979	I mean, Odyssey, or if you count the 3D All-Stars.
2724140	2724780	I guess you could.
2725000	2729584	Like, I know we had Wonder, I know we had Mario Maker, but I mean like a 3D Mario game.
2730704	2731485	It would be nice to see that.
2731505	2732806	They have a 3D one, it was 3D...
2735663	2736003	World.
2736764	2737384	I don't remember though.
2737524	2740786	It was on the Wii U and I thought they remastered it for the Switch.
2740806	2741927	Bowser's Fury and all that.
2741947	2742888	Yeah, you're right.
2744068	2745189	But I don't count that one.
2745229	2748391	I mean like an Odyssey, Mario 64, Sunshine.
2748531	2749952	Oh, I would love a new Odyssey.
2750152	2752754	Yeah, I really would love them to do one too, but we'll see.
2754335	2755676	So, you know, while we wait on that.
2756036	2763681	By the way, also, a little more locally to us, because we're based in Northern California, you know that new Nintendo store opened in San Francisco over the weekend.
2764301	2770205	And apparently you still need appointments to shop there this weekend, but I hear that is getting lifted like early next week.
2770586	2772547	You'll be able to just go into the store and shop.
2773488	2780112	I imagine maybe they'll have a line like they have at the Coach Bag shops and places that are popular like that, especially in Union Square.
2780172	2781793	They only want so many people to shop at a time.
2784194	2786295	That might be something worth visiting in the near future.
2786755	2790636	Actually, I got a push in Pikmin Bloom, because y'all know I still play that.
2790717	2791597	I got a push in Pikmin Bloom.
2791637	2795718	You can get a special Nintendo seedling if you go to the Nintendo store over there.
2796318	2798579	So maybe I'll have to go just to get that.
2799099	2806162	And, you know, check that out, because I think they have a Switch 2 in their little upstairs area that's showing off the new Mario Kart.
2806302	2806502	So...
2807122	2807642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2829471	2840575	But a really helpful trick I read on the internet somewhere is that if you want to focus on main story elements, the path of the main story is always lit.
2841015	2845977	Meaning there'll be lanterns guiding you down that way or some other type of lights down the path.
2847258	2848458	It's not like in your face.
2848578	2849319	It's kind of subtle.
2849659	2852400	But you'll notice if there's a choice to go left or right...
2853120	2853540	and DarkSakura.com.
2875186	2876347	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2890976	2909041	because like I've had a jumping puzzle I've had a puzzle where you can see a little power up like in a window but you don't know how to get to the window and like I know it's connected through this other area and I'm like hugging the wall trying to figure out how the fuck do I get back to the other side I can't find it but if I had a map that'd probably make it a lot easier
2909301	2937627	so it's like an artificial difficulty type of thing I just think it's ridiculous just give me the fucking map especially on the easiest mode just let it be optional if people are like you shouldn't need a map fine let it be optional like any accessibility setting it should be optional calm down I would make that experience so much better but otherwise it's still a great game with a great story and one I would like to finish without getting frustrated so we'll see but that's really it for my gaming week besides like Pokemon Go and stuff still but
2939085	2941166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2960426	2964629	Yeah, QuestBuster in chat says, I will say that Doom the Dark Age has incredible difficulty options.
2965650	2966851	I really want to check that out.
2966891	2969292	That is absolutely on my list of games to get to.
2969833	2974075	I got to say, it's hard not to think Game Pass is kind of on fire right now.
2974476	2979279	Between that, Claire Obscure, South of Midnight, another game on my backlog.
2979659	2981340	Blueprints is on that as well.
2981380	2982881	Bellatro just hit Game Pass.
2983302	2984863	I do feel like Game Pass is like...
2985643	2987624	It's kind of had a slump the last few months.
2987644	2991445	There wasn't as much good stuff on it, but I feel like it's peaking right now.
2991966	2998248	So if you haven't checked out Game Pass lately, it's worth taking a look at because there's a lot of good stuff on it right now.
2999509	3003350	All right, let's get into some other gaming news and headlines.
3003570	3005491	Loki, we're going to go to you to start us off.
3006837	3007598	This is crazy.
3007698	3021030	So yeah, once again, and I say again because it has happened before, Bungie has been caught plagiarizing independent artists again, but this time for Marathon and not Destiny.
3022712	3031260	So it was discovered after a, apparently there was an artist that goes by, looks like
3032225	3035351	Antrail 341 I don't even know what it is.
3035411	3044446	They basically said Marathon Alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from my poster designs I made in 2017.
3046340	3066848	And then, of course, immediately after all that's happened, Bungie put out a statement saying we've immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these textures in a texture sheet that was used ultimately in-game.
3067008	3069909	This issue was unknown by our art team.
3070809	3092135	and we are still reviewing how this oversight could have occurred we take matters like this very seriously yeah but what it's happened before so how seriously are you really taking it like I mean I get it that they're a former artist now at Bungie but yeah it's still not okay um and then uh
3093345	3107351	Yeah, so basically, Antireel said it was kind of indicating to see the direct plagiarism because it meant that I wasn't crazy for feeling so uncomfortable with the overall direction.
3107831	3114654	I kept quiet about it and because I was advised to seek legal action, but I don't have enough money to fly out to the U.S.
3114774	3117795	to pursue an unwinnable court case against Sony.
3120884	3141711	and yeah apparently you know the marathon art director they they've acknowledged the situation um they said there was absolutely no excuse for this oversight and they're working to prevent it from happening again yeah but working to prevent it to happen again doesn't mean that it's going to not happen again because it it's happened already a couple times at least yeah
3142833	3144714	So here's the question I ask.
3144754	3156784	I'm not saying this in a way to defend Bungie at all, but it sounds to me like you had essentially a rogue artist on that team that I'm just going to assume wasn't very good at their job.
3157264	3167832	And so they lifted heavily from these artists, so heavily it pretty much looks like a copy-paste job, and put that in and basically claimed it as their work in the game.
3168332	3178134	But everybody around at Bungie, how would you know that the work was stolen when the person that you thought had the artistic skill to do these things was passing it off as their own work?
3178554	3179615	I'm not saying it's right.
3179675	3195138	I'm just kind of saying I can kind of see how it happens because if this is an artist that is only in one particular part of the internet where not the entire art team is frequently and there's only so much media a person can consume, how is Bungie to identify this sooner?
3196949	3213037	and you can't even say well they need to hold the artists accountable because ours don't work there no more but they gotta have a sort of system to like that these artists are like I what Bungie ought to be able to do is go back to this artist and I hate to say sue him
3213905	3222348	because for basically a breach of contract that they stole art and put into the game and now Bungie's got this whole mess and they should be able to sue that person.
3222368	3223868	I don't know.
3223928	3226989	As these words are leaving my mouth, I'm like, oh, maybe that's not a good idea either.
3227369	3230790	But I'm just like, how do you stop this?
3231931	3239073	I mean, if they were smart, they would have some sort of clause in their employment contract that if you're caught stealing assets...
3239878	3241819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3261331	3262492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3278432	3285403	Questbuster in chat says, to be fair, the art director apologizing has a long history in working with the same kind of sci-fi style scene in Marathon.
3285804	3291594	A rogue artist dropped stolen art related to the same style into the workflow that went unnoticed by everyone.
3294164	3296945	I wonder if there isn't a way people can team up.
3297465	3297805	I don't know.
3297965	3301727	I feel like I have all these great ideas, but not really.
3302307	3306288	Obviously, the industry has to figure this out because it's a horrible look for Bungie.
3306788	3310510	Even if it was an employee who wasn't doing their job at the end of the day, allegedly.
3311850	3312710	It looks horrible on Bungie.
3313151	3313731	It happened twice.
3315458	3322906	Yeah, and apparently, yeah, it says I hid loss in my design six years ago and nobody caught on.
3323747	3328112	And then it's, I don't know if they're talking about like, they put a watermark.
3328412	3332897	Yeah, no, the actual cartoon, you know, the lost cartoon, you know, the infamous meme.
3333618	3357561	The Penny Arcade Comic Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, so there's a very simplified version of that with like tally marks, basically And so that was hidden in one of the art things And that actually was in Bungie's thing, too That's the type of tell where you know it was copy-pasted and not inspired by Something that specific as the Lost Con Which isn't that ironic that essentially the original artist was put, but
3358680	3361121	The Lost Meme is not the original Lost comic.
3361161	3364643	Yes, I'm aware there's a difference, but I am pointing out a little bit of irony.
3366284	3369686	But that's the big tell that it was lifted and not inspired by.
3371407	3371687	Yeah.
3373648	3376370	So, yeah, that's irritating.
3376730	3384194	And it sucks that these big companies get away with this stuff, it feels like, because, you know, if I were to go steal Bungie's things...
3386198	3392424	Would I get the same, like, oh, whoopsie, I'll try not to steal your stuff in the future, everything okay, right?
3393645	3394926	Or would the lawyers come after me?
3396147	3400892	Come on, you know how that... It's certainly not going to be treated the same.
3403410	3403730	All right.
3404231	3413021	Well, we'll see if anything illegal comes of this, although it sounds like the original artist is, you know, their back is kind of up against the wall, not having the resources to take on a big corporation.
3413081	3418608	But what might the policy changes be that come out of Bungie and Sony to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future?
3419807	3426356	Alright, well, one policy at Sony that I think a lot of us wish would be revisited would be the price of video games.
3426897	3434769	And coming from a former PlayStation executive this week, some pretty big comments I think a lot of you are probably not going to agree with.
3435469	3442614	The executive in question, Shuhei Yoshida, he was the previous head of PlayStation Indies.
3443054	3444755	Of course, he doesn't work at Sony anymore.
3445135	3452560	But he was speaking in a video interview with Critical Hits Games during Gamescom Latin America, or LATAM, Gamescom LATAM.
3453020	3458584	He said, when you look at life in general, other products and price have increased, you know, way more than the game price.
3458984	3462927	So I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure.
3463487	3465969	I don't believe that every game has to be priced the same.
3466489	3469491	Each game has different value it provides or the size of a budget.
3469812	3476637	I totally believe it's up to the publisher or developer self-publishing decision to price their product to the value that they believe they are bringing in.
3477758	3491688	In terms of actual price of $70 or $80 for really great games, I think it will still be a steal in terms of the amount of entertainment that the top quality games bring to people compared to other forms of entertainment.
3492168	3496630	As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining.
3497070	3507114	I find it very ironic that he claims that the $70 and $80 game price will be a steal because that's what I see is going to be happening more in this industry, actually, as games get to $80.
3510060	3538677	that's just the reality um and I look again I I understand it's very hard to price art you can look at a lot of things out there you can look at a car you can pay you can get a very cheap car I think what would be a cheap car these days probably 27k I don't know maybe even less than that I don't know but you can probably get a car in the mid 20 thousands or you can get like a hundred thousand dollar car you're probably getting more expensive than that you can you can pay a lot for a car you can pay a lot for a lot of it I just
3539557	3540358	Thanks for watching!
3557534	3559835	That's a completely different scenario, but yes, I'm not going to disagree.
3561035	3567477	But anyway, with that $80 price tag, that's something that they want the mass market to consume.
3567557	3575160	That's supposed to be the normal for a quote unquote car, something to get you from point A to point B. And there's people now looking at that going, you know what, I'll take the bus.
3577110	3590400	I know it's going to be great though and so like I know we've always talked about like Grand Theft Auto 6 and how that's going to you know set the bar for like pricing and stuff like that so let's assume that they're reasonable and they just put the game out for $80
3592205	3592725	Guess what?
3593086	3595708	That's where my bar is for an $80 game from now on.
3595788	3608176	So all you fuckers out there in Sony and Microsoft that think you can pass by your half-finished bullshit with a fucking roadmap on how you're going to correct the issues in it for $80, I'm going to be like, yeah, but Grant the Thought of 6 is $80.
3608517	3609357	Look at that game.
3609377	3610278	It's fucking fantastic.
3610418	3612379	Your game is shit, so why should I pay $80 for it?
3614838	3615999	It goes both ways!
3635168	3635868	Well, right.
3636209	3639371	And guess what luxuries people are going to cut out?
3639831	3644234	Or guess what things people are going to go, you know, I'm just going to go back to piracy.
3645095	3650919	I know it's not a great look, but at least I could, you know, if I have to choose between groceries and a video game, I'll pirate the video game.
3651319	3652380	And what's not going up?
3652420	3653380	Like, people's salaries.
3653400	3661966	So, like, you literally, like, you know, interests aside, you can't have somebody with, say, like, I'm just going to simplify.
3661986	3663107	You can't have somebody with $100.
3666229	3675396	And then they can buy $50 worth of food or your $40 game or whatever the case may be on top of that.
3675476	3678057	And then they have to somehow also have money for rent as well.
3678638	3679819	They're just going to forego...
3681557	3682958	They're going to forego that game.
3682978	3688741	First off, they're going to forego that game for $80 at launch because, one, it's probably going to be buggy as shit.
3689602	3690903	It's going to have its roadmap.
3691103	3694665	It's going to have all this other stuff that's going to come out down the road, and it will be on sale.
3695065	3709414	So why should I be an early adopter, pay for your unfinished game for a premium price when you're just going to fix it later on anyways, and then on top of that, I can just get it cheaper down the road, or I can just...
3710276	3710736	and DarkSakura.com
3733587	3741856	He's from Japan, and they're facing a lot of their own challenges as well, but it's a different culture.
3742657	3745379	Look at the price of the Switch there if you want a Japan-only Switch.
3745439	3746000	It's a Switch 2.
3746601	3748102	It's a very different sort of situation.
3748823	3750284	I don't think he said anything horrible.
3751966	3752646	Horrible.
3753146	3757487	I mean, he did say that people should be able to... I don't think games have to be priced the same.
3758008	3759428	Games can be priced based on their value.
3759488	3764729	I just think the only mistake he made is that $70 or $80 is still going to be a steal based on the top games.
3766530	3769330	Actually, I don't even necessarily have a problem with that comment.
3769710	3780013	What I have a problem with is that all the other executives like him that think they're putting out the top game, that say because they call a game the top game, it is the top game.
3780493	3782354	That's where the mistake is going to be.
3782394	3783995	Remember Quadruple A games?
3784756	3784996	Right.
3785476	3786197	Yeah.
3786317	3787478	And it's funny, though.
3787578	3794602	I wouldn't even have a problem with him saying that a game is a steal for $70 to $80 if that was the actual price of games.
3794983	3797164	But we both know that that's not the case.
3797184	3798065	$70 to $80 is the price to get...
3800086	3801107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3821506	3834611	DLC is on the disc it's just it's a silly argument in the first place it's also unre... it's fine you can go ahead and make the argument as a CEO you have to make the argument, you have to defend yourself but at the end of the day
3835643	3841731	The reality is going to be people are not going to have the money to spend on these games.
3841971	3845756	And the fact that you're trying to push all this stuff, it is not going to happen.
3845776	3850422	You're going to see a lot of these big games flop because people are not buying them because they are not.
3850782	3851863	They're going to be more cautious.
3851883	3854306	They're going to spend their money wisely.
3855347	3874954	Jay Helinski in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says exactly there's no reason to be paying premium prices for games when the standard these days is to ship half a game and fix it in post with updates and such sell me a whole game and I will pay a whole game price and try not to have a knee-jerk reaction anybody to what I'm about to say including you Loki
3875774	3878455	That's why Nintendo tends to get around this.
3878535	3887217	That's why Nintendo tends to... Because for the most part, Nintendo's reputation is they ship pretty solid packages for their first-party games.
3887257	3888218	They are complete titles.
3888618	3898861	Yes, they do dabble in some DLC, but even their DLC, they mostly have the reputation of being pretty well-rounded things.
3898921	3901982	Now, one could argue about, but does that mean they're still worth...
3903302	3906944	$70 for Zelda on top of $20 for DLC.
3908005	3914568	And also we could talk about in the knee-jerk reaction I know people would have would say, Pokemon Scarlet, Rob.
3914648	3916409	And I'd be like, yeah, yeah, you ain't wrong.
3916509	3920951	There's some messy stuff in that where I think that game's kind of held back by hardware.
3920971	3923152	I'm really curious to see how the Switch 2 runs it.
3923632	3925113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3941926	3945928	Who in this room trusts Ubisoft when they put out a game?
3946288	3948890	It's going to be a good, solid game.
3949450	3951651	How about Bethesda, folks?
3951711	3952532	How about Bethesda?
3952592	3956894	How many of us know Bethesda is going to put out a game free of bugs when it releases?
3957234	3960236	And it's going to be worth... But the bugs are included for free.
3960256	3965098	We bought Starfield day one because we knew there'd be no bugs.
3967059	3967760	It just works.
3969940	3973843	I hope you all can hear my tongue firmly planted inside my cheek.
3974564	3975645	QuestBuster says, You know...
3996560	4006506	I love the lols in that comment, but I think you, me, and everybody else knows the reality is, especially with how many times that game's been delayed, they're going to charge $80 for it, at least.
4007687	4015772	So Red Dead Redemption 2 has been the top-selling game for... Oh, yes, Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto V still sell well.
4016752	4017532	Crazy Bananas
4047410	4049306	Yes, in a perfect world where
4051291	4052272	Someone had morality.
4052652	4062978	I would have said three weeks ago after the Switch 2 announcement, I would have said there's a chance you might still get Grand Theft Auto 5 for $70, which is kind of the new norm.
4063018	4064159	I would have said that three weeks ago.
4064259	4069042	Now I'm going to say, nope, you're getting it for $80 because Microsoft came out and said they're raising it to $82.
4069382	4074205	And to me, that's a, well, that just gave Take-Two permission to do the $80 as well.
4074465	4075025	It's a done deal.
4075526	4076246	Going to be at least $80.
4077127	4079248	So start budgeting if that's a game you're going to need.
4082025	4086626	Philanine in chat says, I'm just going to paint a big old 2 on my Switch and pretend it's new.
4086686	4091047	Well, you know, that's the old classic line about what if I can't afford your new console?
4091327	4093088	Well, we still have the Nintendo Switch.
4093668	4096069	That's the exact same thing they said about the Xbox One.
4096109	4096709	You might remember.
4096989	4098389	What if I can't afford an Xbox One?
4098409	4099650	Well, we still have a great Xbox.
4099710	4100330	It's called the Xbox 360.
4100590	4103791	It may die on you, but you know.
4107512	4107932	Moving on.
4108052	4108292	Loki.
4110315	4113858	Yes, so Kojima has a crazy idea.
4114338	4116019	It's a crazy idea for a game.
4116560	4124946	So, it is a game where you would play the game, and if you took a break from the game for like an extended period of time...
4125806	4128648	Your main character would forget things.
4128768	4131649	They would forget information and the abilities.
4132910	4137913	The longer you stay away from the game, they might not know their role in the story or even how to fire a gun.
4139094	4141815	Bandit the game for long enough and the character wouldn't be able to move at all.
4141875	4144877	Players would have to take a week off of work or school to play it.
4146238	4151040	Yeah, that sounds like a great idea, forcing you to totally change your schedule to play your stupid game.
4155538	4158679	I already forget playing games.
4159280	4165683	If I were to go back and try to play Avowed again, which I think I played six weeks ago, I'd be like, I don't remember what the fuck was happening in this game.
4165864	4166824	I literally don't remember.
4167144	4169286	And now you want to make that part of the plot?
4169446	4169646	What?
4170814	4172114	Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
4172194	4175115	So like, you know, Kojima's had a lot of crazy ideas about it.
4175135	4176096	You gotta hear this last one.
4176136	4187979	So the last one, his brand new game idea is actually a game where, you know, if you stay away long enough, the player, your character may actually forget things and forget information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game.
4188259	4193821	They might not know the role in the story or even how to fire a gun and abandon the game for long enough and the character might not be able to move at all.
4194201	4197922	Players that have to take a week off or work from school to play it or work...
4199167	4227920	it's just nuts like why would you force somebody to do that I mean that's almost as bad as an idea as you know a game where like you would forget the information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game and you might not even have your character know how their role in the story or how to fire a gun ban the game for long enough you know and the character wouldn't be able to move at all players would have to take a week off of work or school to play it to be fair to Kojima is this the type of thing that's just it makes for a funny headline and everybody wants to yeah I think it's just an idea that he had
4228680	4232162	And it was an idea that ended up in the bin for a reason.
4232663	4235384	It didn't get made for a reason.
4236385	4252514	Are we able to give Kojima an ounce of credit that maybe the gaming industry and gaming media and social media is just kind of running with this headline about Kojima wants to make this game, you'd have to take a week, where maybe like, oh yeah, I had this idea once, and there's a reason we didn't make the game.
4254295	4254455	Like...
4256286	4256626	I don't know.
4256666	4261853	Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I'm kind of like, maybe there's a reason the game didn't get made.
4262333	4264797	I'll tell you why the game didn't get made.
4265217	4271666	Because he stayed away long enough from developing the game that he actually forgot the role in the story and how to fire a gun and
4272226	4273326	Death Stranding 2 Overdose Overdoser
4297884	4299630	Overdose versus Song in Beatmania.
4299710	4301777	Overdose, right, is the other game he's working on.
4302298	4303081	Whatever happened to that?
4304414	4305774	We had the one trailer and now we don't.
4305835	4307855	I guess we'll get that when we get that.
4308395	4311337	So I'm starting to forget the different Kojima projects.
4311997	4316438	Because then there was, okay, am I wrong?
4316498	4317399	There was Death Stranding 2.
4318439	4319499	There's Overdose.
4320480	4328863	What about, wasn't there a game that he said he is working with Microsoft that runs on the cloud technology that Microsoft has?
4330216	4331458	that he's also making.
4331698	4334642	Wasn't that a thing at one of the Keeley Fest?
4335443	4336184	Oh, is that over?
4336464	4337466	But it's not an overdose.
4337486	4339829	This is an Xbox game exclusive anyway, is it?
4341098	4345041	or is it going to use Azure on Sony, which I mean, I guess could be a thing.
4345101	4345601	I don't know.
4345741	4347442	Azure Cloud.
4347502	4347842	See?
4347862	4347922	See?
4348803	4350264	I can't keep them all straight.
4351244	4352505	It is a farce.
4353026	4353826	It is a farce.
4354146	4355387	I mean, because what is it?
4356088	4358029	It's going to revolutionize Crackdown 3.
4359149	4359550	Come on.
4360730	4362371	Anyways, yeah, so Death Stranding.
4362832	4363372	Yeah, over OD.
4363392	4363952	Fizzin...
4368081	4370324	Is another title that's a working title?
4370965	4371465	Physint?
4372687	4373067	Physint?
4373087	4374969	P-H-Y-S-I-N-T Oh, Physint.
4375150	4375690	Like physics.
4375830	4376051	Okay.
4378129	4378349	See?
4378449	4378770	All right.
4379390	4379590	See?
4380851	4382413	I'm forgetting about Kojima's projects.
4382553	4383414	I'm just going to forget this one.
4383434	4387877	Yeah, OD is the one that's going to be on Microsoft.
4388918	4389519	Oh, it is?
4389699	4390780	Okay, it is the same game.
4390840	4391160	All right.
4391481	4393642	I thought that was just a different announcement.
4393702	4396445	FifthDream in chat says, bring PT back, cowards.
4396665	4398106	Yeah, that would be nice.
4398426	4401409	Or Kojima's vision for Silent Hills.
4401829	4403591	But I guess that's... I mean...
4405212	4409616	Whatever wacky ideas he had for that game, he's probably working into Overdose.
4410016	4412519	Yeah, I mean, they're not all great ideas.
4412679	4415241	They can't all be breathing through your skin, you know?
4417623	4417983	Alright.
4418904	4419565	Moving on.
4420526	4421887	If you are a Nintendo person...
4423342	4423803	and DarkSakura.
4442682	4443842	I'm kinda getting what I want.
4443942	4444423	Kinda.
4444503	4445483	I'll explain what I mean in a minute.
4446123	4457767	We know that through Nintendo's website last week, 11 existing Switch games are going to see enhancements or even new features when the Switch 2 launches.
4458207	4465409	These can be things like HDR support or, you know, a better frame rate that will support game chat and all this stuff.
4465730	4468791	So all these games are basically getting Switch 2 bump-ups.
4468871	4469651	These are free.
4470111	4471032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4487665	4490367	Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is on the list.
4490587	4491428	Thank God.
4491848	4505879	They say simply visuals optimized for the Nintendo Switch to display and high resolution TVs for improved image quality and frame rate improved for smoother movement on Nintendo Switch to thank God.
4505959	4508162	God, because that's y'all.
4508223	4515333	Have you played Pokemon Scarlet and looked at the things in the background that like the characters that literally move like this in the background?
4515473	4516375	It's wild.
4516795	4521523	So I'm I'm very curious to see, like, is it going to be a really nice little bump up?
4523567	4526310	And this is why I said I mostly got what I want.
4526670	4530133	Pokemon Legends Arceus, not on the list at all.
4530713	4533395	And that was a game I was really hoping would get some bumps.
4534296	4538159	But I guess, you know, everything, the focus is on Legends Z to A right now.
4538659	4543963	But still, I hope just because it's not on the list now doesn't mean it won't be on the list ever.
4544484	4545544	Maybe it'll get added later.
4545584	4545925	We'll see.
4546685	4552851	But also getting bumped up, and I won't go into details on all of these, but Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.
4553632	4554613	New Super Mario Bros.
4554733	4556015	U Deluxe.
4556335	4559578	For whatever reason, Zelda Echoes of Wisdom and Zelda...
4560948	4561849	Captain Toad Treasure Tracker
4582587	4582887	Arms.
4583068	4584348	I forgot about that fucking game.
4584509	4586710	Arms is getting some Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades.
4587230	4588611	Game Builder Garage.
4589012	4594975	That one kind of surprised me, except they're putting Joy-Con 2 Mouse into Game Builder Garage, which I think is really interesting.
4595336	4595936	So that's kind of cool.
4596336	4597897	And then Clubhouse Games.
4597957	4602100	We knew that was coming because we saw that in a lot of the Game Share previews.
4602701	4605242	And then Big Brain Academy, Brain vs. Brain.
4605262	4606763	That is also going on the list.
4607164	4607984	So that's pretty cool.
4609125	4611747	Obviously, it would be nice to see a little more.
4612407	4613429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4629531	4658771	so uh let's see some games that we can get with upgrades um a wizard novel game that you shouldn't play is one of those games that's gonna be a $10 upgrade uh Civilization 7 is also getting a $10 upgrade which uh makes sense the um mouse support and all that stuff is gonna be uh added to that which is nice uh Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma uh I believe is also one of those games so neat uh
4658951	4659331	Let's see.
4660312	4662993	Now, not every third-party game is necessarily doing this.
4663493	4667555	Sonic X Shadow Generations does not seem to have an upgrade pack.
4668216	4675439	We also do not know how things like Hades 2, which is getting launched on Switch 1 and 2 at the same time, we don't know how that works yet.
4676119	4681582	You know, you would hope it's like the PlayStation 5 where you buy one, you get both, but I just, I don't think that's how it's going to work.
4683423	4687145	So we'll see how other third-party games are handled soon.
4689423	4693105	DarkTutsi in chat says, I'm still miffed Sega wouldn't do it for Puyo Tetris 2.
4694806	4697588	Unintentional genius that I never bought Puyo Tetris 2.
4698008	4699669	I had one, but I never bought two.
4700009	4703331	But now I can get it for the Switch 2 and go, it's a good thing I never bought it for Switch 1.
4705132	4707174	Anyway, what else on the Nintendo front, Loki?
4709175	4721888	Nintendo won't... I mean, not that this is surprising, but basically saying that they're not committing to the Switch staying $450 in North America after launch.
4722369	4723570	Or at least in the United States.
4724771	4725051	Duh.
4725392	4730036	Because we literally don't know what... We don't know what tariffs are going to be tomorrow.
4730097	4730917	So, like, I mean...
4732074	4733475	Yeah, duh.
4734015	4737218	This is what's going to piss everybody off or at least going to piss me off.
4737258	4737538	I don't know.
4737558	4740540	There's some people out there that think everything that's happening is wonderful and great.
4741180	4743722	But like there's still going to be tariffs.
4744202	4745243	I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.
4745303	4748505	There are still going to be tariffs and it is still going to be pitched as a win.
4748905	4753569	And this cost is going to get handed down to you and people are going to be like, yeah, but it's not as bad as it was.
4755630	4762273	It's like how they slowly increase the price of gas to get us to go, wow, $4 a gallon of gas is really cheap.
4762293	4766895	Yeah, it's going to be so crazy when those tariffs go away and the prices stay the same.
4766915	4768596	It's going to be nuts.
4769216	4772818	That's just like, oh, there's only a 30% tariff on China now.
4773038	4773278	Only?
4776479	4787369	for now until you know and then or he'll like start demanding that Walmart eats the tariff price which I love to see how that finishes can't wait to see how that one finishes
4788171	4788831	Well, wait a second.
4788851	4789271	Wait, wait.
4789291	4793233	You're saying that they have to pay more?
4793613	4796834	I thought that the country that they're importing from paid more.
4796974	4797134	Oh, no.
4797454	4798735	My argument's breaking down.
4798955	4806257	If he is saying we don't need billionaires at the top of the organizations, you should be eating that wealth.
4806497	4808058	You should be taking it out of your pay.
4808098	4810739	We should not have billionaires in this country.
4811359	4814220	If that is the reason why he's saying this...
4815120	4819243	My God, I never knew the unintentional genius behind all of this.
4819303	4819763	Holy shit.
4819883	4821044	That is not what he's saying.
4821224	4822024	I guarantee it.
4824626	4828628	Yeah, but he basically just doesn't want to look negative on him.
4829289	4829789	But whatever.
4829809	4830329	I don't care.
4831190	4832310	So anyways, yes.
4832330	4833971	Yes, blame anybody but yourself.
4834031	4835192	It's worked the rest of your life.
4835252	4836073	Why shouldn't it work now?
4836772	4841195	There's no guarantee that they're going to stay at that price, obviously, because of tariffs.
4841255	4842336	I mean, that's a duh.
4842436	4843157	No kidding.
4843857	4851103	Sony's saying also that the PlayStation 5 price hikes are possible as well as it faces tariffs
4852270	4853711	as well.
4854031	4856412	I mean, duh.
4857172	4858372	Sony's a ticking time bomb.
4858512	4860553	The $1,000 PlayStation.
4860993	4868516	What I'm curious about is, okay, if the China thing got adjusted, does that mean the Xbox thing is going to come down?
4870736	4872937	I don't expect it to come down as far as it was.
4873258	4874859	I could see them doing that.
4874959	4878561	It's like a mid-generation dropping the prices like they used to.
4878741	4879742	I could see them doing that.
4879822	4882224	It would be necessarily... But not the $80 game.
4882444	4884706	No, not the $80 game.
4884726	4886507	Of course not, because they're making money off that.
4887047	4892511	But I could see they're not going to lose money on these consoles, so obviously they're going to raise the prices for them.
4894493	4895934	I just don't see how...
4897366	4897706	and so on.
4922588	4922768	This is...
4952051	4953751	Yeah, and they may have to pivot.
4980518	4982299	We have games still coming out on PlayStation 4.
4982859	4984320	That Capcom Fighting Collection.
4984700	4988402	I mean, granted, you're basically emulating, you know, Dreamcast and PS2 games.
4988522	4995725	But still, that came out on PlayStation 4 and last generation's Xbox, as well as PlayStation 5 and so forth.
4995765	5000508	So there's still games releasing on what is now last gen's hardware.
5001288	5004370	And I think that's going to absolutely still continue to be the same for Switch.
5005350	5005971	for a while.
5006111	5008693	I think the Switch is really going to start to get locked out.
5008833	5016501	The original Switch is going to really start to get locked out by third parties that are like, we have to really scale down these games to release on the original Switch.
5017301	5019623	But a lot of that depends on Switch 2 sales, I think.
5020925	5021045	So...
5022386	5031450	Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time when we didn't have $80 game prices, but people showing you magazine ads from back in the day will try to make you think it.
5032150	5034031	It's the classic game of the week.
5034211	5035732	Let's roll the bumper for that now.
5046385	5053712	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5054153	5056615	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5057611	5059112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5078126	5083749	This game existed on just about every 1980s computing system out there.
5084089	5088872	I'm going to show you, for those watching live on Twitch, I'm going to show you the Macintosh version of it.
5088892	5092574	Believe it or not, it was actually one of the better looking versions of this because it came out later.
5092594	5094055	I think this version came out in 87.
5094655	5095776	But you're probably wondering, what game?
5095796	5096156	What game?
5096536	5098978	The game I've picked tonight as Classic Game of the Week is...
5099798	5101979	PINBALL CONSTRUCTION SET
5120786	5125808	It originally came out in 1982 for the Apple II.
5126208	5131071	And then it came out later on with ports for Atari's 8-bit collection of computers.
5131171	5134692	And then the version that I remember, you know, of course, was the Commodore 64.
5134812	5140895	It was released by Electronic Arts, which used to be ECA, but now they're just EA.
5141155	5143736	But Electronic Arts, yep, they existed all that time ago.
5144316	5145517	And the game was released.
5145597	5147858	It was actually called on the box DarkSakura.
5147938	5156476	Bill Budge pinball construction set because Bill Budge was the individual who actually created this game by the way he's retired now
5157600	5162766	He made other games like Raster Blaster he made on the Apple II.
5163807	5173277	And then he wrote a game I think called Mouse Paint, which was very – but he pretty much – he worked for the 3DO for a little bit, worked on Blade Force and then ended up fading out of the game industry.
5173357	5178463	But Pinball Construction Set I think was huge and a really incredible contribution to the industry.
5178983	5181165	So in this game, you build a pinball table.
5181445	5186749	So you have all the parts on the right side of the screen, and then you have an empty pinball table on the left.
5187129	5194834	Sadly, you can't really change the layout of the pinball table, which some would argue, well, that makes it a little... But you could still add your own ramps.
5194894	5195675	You could add other things.
5195975	5198317	Look, the game was made in 1982.
5198457	5202580	And for the time that it came out, it was very damn impressive.
5203000	5207083	What was also really neat about this was that with some of the ports...
5207643	5208484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5230496	5241662	and uh I could put that on a disc and I could go give that to Loki and he could play the game without necessarily needing to even have pinball construction set which is really cool so um
5243345	5247029	Yeah, again, Bill Budge made this game originally for the Apple II.
5247869	5255757	Originally, he didn't really want to write another game, but he started kind of experimenting with game tools and graphic tools.
5256477	5266387	And part of the process involved him actually purchasing and disassembling an old Target Alpha pinball machine made by Gottlieb.
5267328	5268048	from back in the day.
5268469	5276157	So he wanted to actually take some of the components from that and sort of like accurately depict it in this sort of... See, and we're looking at the Mac version being played.
5276397	5278900	The Mac version had extra shit because it came out later.
5278980	5284525	Like it actually had skins for the pinball table and like cool things that didn't exist in the original version of the game.
5284906	5287849	But it just made it even that much better, honestly.
5288309	5288489	So...
5290131	5290952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5307864	5325628	Bill, even if you didn't care for video games and what have you, I think you made a hell of a contribution to the industry with this, just in the sense of the whole build your own thing and let other people explore the thing, which I think so much of gaming is now these days, and you really see the cool stuff in games.
5326088	5330689	And the fact that you didn't have to have this game in order to play it on another system was just...
5331289	5331970	It was just awesome.
5332190	5333471	So what a great contribution.
5334212	5338416	Pinball Construction Set, it came out and it sold over a quarter of a million copies.
5338736	5345982	Actually, ultimately 300,000 copies by the time the 90s when we kind of look at like a final sales figure for this game.
5346443	5349025	So some other accolades for this game.
5349125	5357152	Steve Wozniak, you recognize this one of the names behind Apple, said it is, quote, the greatest program ever written for an 8-bit machine.
5357993	5367341	and mentioning that for many people, this was their first sort of experience with a GUI or graphical user interface, right?
5367401	5377430	Computer Gaming World in 1983 said it was a revolutionary software toy and easy to understand because of the icons and the drag and drop and all that other stuff that came with the game.
5378530	5385994	The nine-page manual that it came with was actually considered overkill by some because you didn't need programming knowledge to make this work.
5386555	5391137	And it's funny, they mention in here an eight-year-old had no problems creating his own tables.
5391678	5392518	I'm living proof.
5392778	5398301	I was that eight-year-old playing this game because I had a Commodore 64 when I was five.
5398321	5402364	And I think by the time I was seven, I think we finally kind of got this game on the Commodore 64.
5402724	5405125	And yeah, I was able to make simple pinball tables.
5405165	5406406	I mean, they probably weren't very fun.
5407006	5410967	but they were, they were pinball tables, which is pretty, pretty amazing.
5411667	5414688	Um, some other releases of this game.
5414848	5419469	Ultimately, uh, we had a Coleco Adam version that was planned.
5419769	5424650	It was going to be a dual release with a hard hat Mac that was supposed to be the best of electronic arts.
5424770	5429531	It was never released, but there's footage out there online that you can actually find, uh, of this.
5429571	5429651	I'm
5433152	5434133	Thank you for watching!
5450683	5457785	There were 29 pre-made tables in the game, or you could design your own using the in-game editor tools, and then it had the themes and all that stuff.
5457825	5465706	So Virtual Pinball was essentially a souped-up version of this, it's just you couldn't really trade around or anything, which is what made this game kind of legendary back in the day.
5466106	5469947	But yes, I see some of you in chat, I think, brought this game up, and yes, it is related.
5469987	5472568	Virtual Pinball on Genesis was a version of this.
5472928	5473088	So...
5475322	5475622	Let's see.
5475682	5478485	And PodCulture was saying a modern version of this could be cool.
5479005	5486552	And Bobby Blackwell points out it's called Virtual Pinball X. Jay Helinski points out it sounds like OG Roblox.
5486913	5487413	Kinda.
5487453	5490916	That's what I... Yeah, Bobby says Virtual Pinball X does not equal Virtual Pinball.
5490976	5491397	It doesn't.
5491497	5494740	But do you think there might be some reasoning behind the name?
5497022	5497703	I think there's kind of that.
5498023	5498343	But anyway...
5500382	5502964	Jay Helinski says, sounds like OG Roblox.
5503024	5507166	And yeah, that's what I'm talking about with the whole, like, build your own game and now publish your own game and that whole thing.
5507907	5510088	You know, I think Pinball Construction Set is really a root.
5510348	5513770	There were other construction sets that ended up being released.
5514090	5516532	I remember I had a music construction set.
5516892	5520734	There was, I think, one called Deconstruction Set that was a racing game.
5521034	5524416	Because it was like, you know, it's supposed to be like monster trucks, deconstructors.
5524776	5525677	That was a thing, too.
5526638	5527398	So, yeah.
5528118	5528199	Um...
5529119	5530080	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5549361	5553725	Budge released the source code to the Atari 8-bit version.
5554066	5557849	He released it on GitHub under the MIT license.
5558390	5561213	So if you want to go check that out, you can get it.
5562489	5566170	Yeah, there was, okay, and some of the other titles are linked here.
5566290	5569951	Music Construction Set, Adventure Construction Set.
5570452	5571612	Shit, I never played that one.
5571632	5572452	That sounds really cool.
5572592	5574693	Oh yeah, that was like an old school RPG maker.
5574773	5575633	Shit, I never played that one.
5576033	5578934	And then Racing Destruction Set was the other one I was trying to think of.
5580335	5583276	Were all kind of those games, but I don't think Bill Budge had anything to do with the others.
5583316	5585216	I think that was more of a publishing label thing.
5585656	5587617	Yeah, Will Harvey made Music Construction Set.
5587857	5590678	It was just a publishing label thing, but I'll tell you what,
5593083	5597847	Pinball Construction Set, one of my fave, fave, fave games as a kid.
5598107	5601409	And one of the reasons I love pinball as much as I do.
5601710	5603471	And yeah, I think this is a great title.
5603491	5605813	I'm glad y'all could learn about this game.
5606493	5609115	Loki, did you, you love these type of make your own game things.
5609155	5612558	Like I know ZZT, when I throw it back to that, you get excited too.
5612578	5613559	Did you ever play this at all?
5613819	5614459	Pinball Construction Set?
5614479	5614980	I did not.
5615180	5615620	You didn't?
5615740	5616361	Oh, that's a bummer.
5616980	5617360	It's cool.
5617660	5618080	Yeah, wow.
5618141	5622762	And looking at the Mac version, there's so much more with the Mac version you could do than the other ones.
5623223	5623983	That's kind of interesting.
5624023	5624503	I feel like that.
5624563	5630546	But that was the last, essentially the last one outside of the virtual pinball on Genesis that was released.
5630726	5631706	So anyway, there you go.
5632086	5634667	My classic game of the week, pinball construction set.
5634727	5637008	Again, I know I've brought this up on OLR before.
5637128	5640510	I think just kind of like tangentially about the make your own game things.
5640550	5642410	And I remember a game like that when I was a kid.
5643291	5645452	So now it's officially recognized as a game of the week.
5645472	5645872	So there you go.
5647233	5653135	Okay, and also an acknowledgement to DarkSakura and the Pinball Festival she's at right now.
5654575	5661057	I don't think she's there tonight, but I think she's recovering a bit, but still at this weekend that we'll hear more about next week.
5661817	5663477	Okay, let's get into some other headlines.
5663597	5665538	Loki, let's go back to you for some rapid fire news.
5666511	5669572	Alright, so we got a cool tease of Fallout Season 2.
5669612	5676073	It's going to be on Amazon at the end of this year, I think in December.
5676453	5684795	And of course, as they tease at the end of Season 1 of New Vegas, they go into more of that as well.
5684875	5686895	So it is going to take place in New Vegas.
5687295	5688255	Very excited to see this.
5688495	5691276	And it's already been picked up for Season 3 as well, so...
5692417	5694118	Looking forward to checking that out.
5695099	5704466	And then we have news that a Lego Bionicle fan game has been given the cease and desist.
5704526	5710811	Lego Group has basically told them to take it offline and erase its existence.
5712192	5713833	It's been in development for eight years.
5713853	5718217	In fact, actually, at one point, I think that the Lego team had actually seen
5719177	5748227	The progress of it or whatever and still kind of gave them the go ahead but now for whatever reason though they've had to shut it down so that was a game called Bionicle Massive Power and what's going to happen now is I believe that the team is going to, first off they're changing the name because they were team Kanoe which I think ties back to Bionicle so now they're just Unmasked Games and they're going to repurpose it into its own like IP so basically not throwing away all the development that they've done on it but
5748707	5749188	Reskin it.
5749228	5755732	Kind of similar to what they did with that whole racing game that they put on the PlayStation 1.
5757013	5757434	What was it?
5757534	5758234	Not Dark Souls.
5758455	5762478	I can't remember the name of it.
5763258	5764979	It was the Bloodborne racing game.
5764999	5765680	Bloodborne, yes.
5765740	5766280	Thank you.
5766320	5766921	Bloodborne, yes.
5767241	5768642	The Bloodborne racing game.
5769683	5770344	Similar to that.
5770524	5773406	So they're going to just repurpose it into its own game, I think.
5775165	5777628	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5796929	5817892	of the original Metal Gear and you can tell this is the MSX version of Metal Gear because the opening moments are straight in that first building and not the whole sequence that the NES version opens up with but yeah you can actually download this from itch.io and apparently it will actually run on a Genesis or what they call a Mr. device and of course emulators uh
5818012	5818392	and DarkSakura.
5842188	5845009	Yeah, it's really cool.
5845610	5847190	I kind of want to play this, to be honest.
5847230	5848031	It looks great.
5848331	5858216	It's kind of a way to experience the MSX version, but on a platform more of us in the States are familiar with, being the fact that we had a Mega Drive here as the Genesis.
5858676	5859656	It looks smooth.
5859696	5860177	It looks great.
5860357	5860717	I love it.
5861377	5862538	So, all right.
5864576	5865117	Let's move on.
5865378	5870833	Let's travel around the world and check out some dates of games that we're going to get a little newer.
5871214	5872317	Let's start in the U.S., Loki.
5873308	5893582	Alright, so we've got Nitro Express on PC, Kathy Rain 2, Soothsayer on PC, Mac, and Linux, Neko Neko Travel Agency, Peachy Town Revitalization Project on PC and Nintendo Switch, Roadcraft on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5894663	5899746	We have the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Splintered Fate on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
5901226	5929967	Fantasy Life I, The Girl Who Steals Time on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Knock on the Coffin Lid on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series Monster Train 2 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Blades of Fire on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series Deliver at All Costs on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series
5931188	5940936	Duck Detective, The Ghost of Glamping on PC, Mac, and Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5941556	5944999	Also, Duck Detective, The Secret Salami on PlayStation 5.
5946720	5951744	Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Battle Destiny Remastered on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5952925	5959089	The Town of Nigh, Iron Musubi on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5959189	5960650	Is that where the knights who say Nii live?
5962991	5964392	I think it's Nigh and not Nii.
5964513	5964953	Oh, okay.
5965073	5965853	Well, never mind then.
5965954	5966574	Unfortunately not.
5968115	5973299	Then we have, coming out of Early Access, Warhammer 40k Speed Freaks on PC.
5974969	5989427	Worshippers of Cthulhu also coming out of Early Access on PC and Onimusha 2 Samurai's Destiny on PC, Nintendo Switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox One that's it

6172987	6173647	Remember that game?
6173967	6176049	That's the game by the Katamari folks.
6176549	6177389	Oh, yeah.
6177510	6177810	All right.
6178666	6179387	Looks awesome.
6179407	6179727	Can't wait.
6179987	6180247	Nice.
6181088	6181368	All right.
6181869	6184851	We have just another quick news story here, and then we're going to get to our listener roundtable.
6184891	6186813	We actually have an email tonight we're going to get into.
6187153	6189736	We're going to get into some posts from Blue Sky you sent us as well.
6190176	6191677	So we have a pretty packed listener roundtable.
6191697	6196662	We'll see if we can fit in a call or two as well if you want to join our green room over at the VOG Network Discord.
6197302	6198523	vognetwork.com.discord.
6198543	6200365	We'll be taking those a little later in the show.
6200465	6204408	But let's get to the last thing we have here tonight, Loki.
6205205	6221416	so we have a game that's been cancelled and a new game so a game that has been cancelled Kingdom Hearts The Missing Link which began development back in 2019 if you don't remember what that game was apparently it was going to be a Pokemon Go style mobile spin-off of Kingdom Hearts
6222176	6242222	and it just was cancelled because of quality over quantity as an AR gaming fan I was really like interested to see what they were going to bring to the table but if it was not great I'm kind of glad they cancelled it I'm glad they recognized because a lot of AR game knockoffs have been not great Garfield Go not good not good
6243212	6244533	I'm shocked, I'm shocked.
6245833	6257799	Although, along with that, of course, they announced that Kingdom Hearts 4 is coming as well, and they showed off some screenshots, which, I have to say, I'm not exactly thrilled of the art direction of it.
6258019	6271626	It is a little more Final Fantasy 15, 16 versus Kingdom Hearts because it's going that more realistic route and less of the, you know, kind of cartoony style that they used to have.
6274325	6296625	but yeah according to the social media posts to our Kingdom Hearts community we're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts 4 and we'll continue pouring ourselves into the game development we're dedicated to making this experience that lives up to your expectations we've seen how excited you are and truly grateful for the bottom of our hearts and yada yada yada and that game will come out when it comes out it'll come out when it comes out later on
6297285	6299686	I just, like I said, I'm not excited about the art direction.
6299706	6304487	I really wish they would have kept that same style because it just looks off.
6307408	6308128	All right.
6308749	6309589	And he can play as Mickey.
6310949	6312030	According to screenshots.
6312550	6312870	Hmm.
6313990	6314730	That'll be interesting.
6315811	6318272	Yeah, I guess we haven't been able to do that in the franchise before, huh?
6319352	6319812	I don't think so.
6320132	6320532	No, I don't know.
6320552	6321593	I haven't played enough Kingdom Hearts.
6321833	6324734	No, I don't think so, because he was always kind of there.
6324814	6326014	But yeah, interesting.
6327011	6329592	All right, let's go to the listener roundtable.
6329672	6334613	We're going to take your emails, your calls, your blue sky posts.
6334913	6335713	Let's get to the mailbag.
6335753	6342335	We do have an email tonight coming to us from Rin Mari, who was not able to make the show tonight, but wants to send along this email.
6342375	6343456	Thank you for the email, Rin Mari.
6343496	6348437	And if you would like to send us an email in the future, please consider participate at orange.com.
6348797	6349557	Send us your thoughts.
6350378	6351098	It's me, Mari.
6351658	6354324	I want to talk about sports games and why I think they're kind of interesting.
6363334	6368695	Like, you know, before I jump into the email, not all sports games are necessarily bad.
6368735	6373436	I have a soft spot in my heart for Blades of Steel, you know, and some of the old school.
6373476	6377977	I think the more cartoony, the more older, like Tecmo Bowl and stuff I used to love.
6378637	6379937	I guess I love a good racing game.
6379957	6388238	So I don't know if I think that sports games are necessarily bad, but I understand we do dog on the Madden roster update and sorts of things.
6388278	6390039	But anyway, let me jump back into the email.
6390939	6390999	Um,
6391997	6398741	Ranmari continues, like, yes, there's the annual update games that people like to meme on, like the Madden and FIFA series, right?
6398781	6399121	Called out.
6399781	6414070	But then there's the silly-looking but also have a lot of depth sports games, like the Mario Tennis series and Hot Shots Golf, games where the devs can focus more on making a quality game because they're not beholden to updating non-fictional character stats to reflect their real-life counterparts.
6415006	6415426	DarkSakura.com
6437867	6443210	A lot of my friends around the same political spectrum as me remarked that we should ban golf to piss off rich people.
6443790	6446451	Oh, I can think of one that would be particularly pissed, Ranmari.
6447032	6447852	I'll tell you who it is.
6448072	6453275	It's somebody who spends a lot of days where they ought to be doing their fucking job out playing golf at Mar-a-Lago.
6453855	6461642	Anyway, also there's alternatives to traditional golf like Topgolf, which is basically a driving range with bowling-like gameplay, and Minigolf.
6461702	6464284	They're building a second one of those Topgolfs in Sacramento.
6464444	6465745	I don't know if you know that, Loki.
6465845	6468568	There's the one out in Roseville, and they're building a second one on the west side of town.
6469048	6469448	It's wild.
6469749	6470409	Oh, wow.
6470849	6471510	Anyway, um...
6472891	6482317	Around the time I started listening to this show in 2006, I also got into an MMO game called Pangaea, then known as Albatross 18 in Not Asia.
6482518	6483838	Oh, I remember Albatross 18, okay.
6484339	6495166	And that took up a lot of my free time going into my university years, being a great way to be social with friends and games, but without having to put the chat away for extended periods of time due to extremely sweaty action-based gameplay.
6495566	6498788	Take your shot, and while you wait for everyone else to take their turn, shoot the shit.
6499209	6502211	Or do a tournament and enjoy a 30-person chat room with a golf course in it.
6502951	6520276	Sadly, Pangaea shut down some time ago, and I have yet to see anything like it really fill the void.
6520696	6530619	Sure, there's golf games with online components, like the newer Mario Golf games, but they really lack that social aspect that made Pangaea such an addictive experience, and often have really short sessions.
6535221	6540583	I guess my takeaway from this is game industry, give us a new MMO golf game, please.
6541303	6544184	Something to take me away from being sweaty at Tactical Nexus.
6544544	6547906	I have 200 hours into that game, and I still don't know what I'm doing.
6548226	6549266	Strongers are waiting.
6549366	6551007	That whole sentence is crossed out, by the way.
6551747	6566378	anyways have a great show I'll catch you folks another Sunday well we appreciate the email and yeah I think there's a lot of you know when I think of like sports games that are really interesting I like to think of ones that really just kind of like mix up like you know what one of my favorite sports games is Kirby Miniature Golf
6567299	6568140	on the Super Nintendo.
6568160	6568640	You remember that?
6569080	6571502	The one where Kirby turned into a golf.
6571582	6574544	It was maybe I'm butchering the name of it.
6574824	6575405	Dream Course.
6575465	6575905	Dream Course.
6575925	6576165	That's it.
6576205	6577246	Yes, it was Kirby's Dream Course.
6577727	6579568	So it was like miniature golf, but Kirby.
6579928	6584631	But like, you know, you would have the different angled shots and Kirby was like a little golf ball.
6584671	6586072	It was really fun and cute.
6586613	6591396	And I don't I certainly don't hate like I was saying earlier, I don't hate all sports games, but I think you're right.
6591476	6596440	A lot of the roster update, hyper realistic stuff just gets a little it's just a little much.
6597000	6601002	For me, you know, there's just too much that goes into it.
6601122	6603023	I liked it when it was NBA Jam.
6603143	6605124	Jump, shoot, easy.
6607325	6618071	But you make some valid points when it comes to being able to enjoy a sport that, you know, for whatever reasonability or what have you, you might not be able to, or maybe just lack of people you know that play it could be a big reason for that.
6618551	6619912	I mean, think about it.
6620851	6622673	Could dancing be considered a sport?
6622833	6637705	Because we all met playing DDR and I realized a lot of the topics we would discuss back in the day had to do with DDR getting recognized as an Olympic sport or the notion to try to get it recognized at the Olympics or as an X Games or whatever the fuck was going on back in the day.
6638726	6641388	But I would consider DDR was kind of a sports game.
6641488	6642049	Kinda.
6642629	6643050	Kinda.
6645192	6646613	Is Skate or Die a sports game?
6646733	6647674	I would say it kinda is.
6648649	6649329	This is a lot of fun.
6649609	6651750	Summer games, summer games and summer games too.
6651790	6654051	I played the shit out of those games on my Commodore 64.
6654371	6655932	Winter games, another one too.
6656112	6658273	So there's a lot of fun sports games out there.
6658653	6664636	I think it's just the stuff that gets like really, really in the weeds realistic just goes over my head because I don't watch a lot of it on TV.
6664936	6666537	But the cartoony ones are great.
6667937	6668778	Anyway, thanks for the email.
6668918	6669358	Appreciate it.
6670638	6674160	All right, let's head over to Blue Sky.
6674820	6676541	Loki, are there some sports games that you enjoy?
6678993	6679153	No.
6681055	6685660	I mean, I sort of used to button mash NFL Blitz.
6686561	6687062	Okay, that works.
6688543	6691246	I've never really gotten to NBA Jam.
6693208	6694610	Racing games are always fun.
6694630	6694730	Yeah.
6697062	6700784	Alright, well we asked this question to our listeners this week on Blue Sky.
6700824	6702465	We have a few answers I'd like to share with you.
6702965	6711029	So the question was, for our listener roundtable tonight, DarkSakura has talked about a local pinball show in Lodi she likes to attend.
6711069	6712470	That's the Golden State Pinball Festival.
6714091	6716952	Do you have a favorite local gaming show that you like to go to?
6717572	6720374	What makes this expo, convention, or show special for you?
6721365	6722565	So let's read some of your answers.
6723146	6727647	Orange Rite says the only convention I go to annually is California Extreme.
6728047	6729488	I need to see when that is this year.
6729808	6732029	What are the dates for California Extreme this year?
6732049	6732949	Because it's got to be coming up.
6733349	6734329	It's got to be in July.
6735010	6736930	Better not be the same weekend as Southern Fried.
6736970	6737831	I don't think it would be though.
6737911	6740672	I think it would be later because it's usually July or August.
6741012	6741552	I would love to go.
6742092	6745015	Anyway, the only convention I go to annually is California Extreme.
6745376	6752703	Lots of great arcade games, there's usually a good rhythm game section, and there's lots of curiosities like Billy Bowl, Panic Park, and Prop Cycle.
6753064	6756467	Have been going since the 2010s, which was probably the last time I went.
6757188	6766271	DarkDetsuya says, I wish we had one closer enough to us to go, but the last thing that was closest to gaming was the two years of WonderCon that I went to with my brother.
6766932	6773154	Although Nintendo and Capcom did have boosts with their upcoming games, so I suppose it at least partially counts.
6773694	6775555	Sure, whatever speaks to you, DarkDetsuya.
6775575	6776575	There's no right or wrong answer.
6777595	6781397	Bryguy2365 on Blue Sky replies to us and says,
6782665	6789028	My friends and I like going to too many games just outside of Philly every year.
6789068	6789688	I've heard of this one.
6790429	6792429	We've been going for the last 10 years or so.
6792870	6796731	It's the few times we can go and forget about the real world for a weekend.
6797232	6799293	All while celebrating our love of video games.
6799553	6802114	I got to meet YYR at too many games once as well.
6802414	6803475	That's why I've heard of it.
6803655	6805055	YYR went to that once.
6805295	6805615	Okay.
6806056	6807496	And I have friends out of that area too.
6807556	6809577	That's why I remember when YYR was plugging that show.
6809837	6810778	That's awesome you guys got to meet.
6811963	6812644	AJ Twist Evo
6832327	6858289	I love those answers and I'm going to tell you some of my secret reason why I was asking that question was that I'm like if there is a convention I should be going to that I'm not going to I kind of want to know about it so maybe I need to put that on my radar actually should be a thing that I probably want to think about doing because I want to go to more conventions I want to try to get on more panels and have fun and do that type of stuff I think it would be fun
6859260	6862181	There's a couple, I will say there's actually an expo in LA I'm looking into.
6862402	6864823	So more to come on that if I actually end up going.
6866884	6867504	All right.
6869185	6871025	Some folks in chat participating as well.
6871085	6874647	Bobby Blackwell says, California Extreme is July 19th through 20th.
6875067	6877708	It's the weekend Southern Pride game would have been.
6878108	6881470	Aha, that's why I remember those days conflicting before.
6882090	6883151	Well, that doesn't matter now.
6883211	6887513	If it's July 19th this year, that might work out a lot better for me.
6889611	6892895	I'm free that weekend.
6893276	6894137	I might have to make that happen.
6894157	6894658	That'd be great.
6896820	6897341	Let's see.
6898122	6904850	PodCulture says there's a really cool pinball place in Terre Haute, Indiana that I've been to a few times on my way to and from Illinois.
6905110	6906833	ICC and Indy is a big one.
6908448	6908989	Good times.
6909649	6910089	Good times.
6910829	6913530	Alright, well thank you for sharing those answers with us.
6913630	6914271	We appreciate it.
6915031	6920953	And with that, we don't have any calls waiting, so let's check in with Loki for any last minute stories.
6921033	6922314	Any last minute stories for us tonight, Loki?
6923454	6932398	I've got the exclusive Garfield Cart 2 All You Can Drift has been leaked by the Australian Rating Board.
6933198	6934099	I know you're all excited.
6935319	6937280	Forget that Mario Kart, you know,
6938224	6940994	World, it's all about Garfield Kart 2.
6943170	6946793	S21100 Matt in chat says, I thought Ranma was going to call in from Japan.
6946853	6949435	Yeah, I remember him saying that, but let's be real.
6950075	6953357	He's in Japan right now having fun, going out and doing shit.
6953518	6961643	I'm not going to have call OLR front of memory for me either unless I, well, if it was me, maybe I would because it's the show I'm on every week.
6961723	6967668	But I fully expect Ranma is out there having a good time right now, maybe recovering from last night because it's more of the morning over there.
6968608	6971109	He probably thought the show would be going until nine o'clock tonight, too.
6971209	6973190	So maybe he was hoping he'd call in a little later.
6973571	6977473	But I know he made it because I've seen some of the updates on Facebook and all that good stuff.
6977853	6981014	But yeah, we'll just have to hear from Ranma how Japan is going.
6981054	6983015	But I hope he's having the best time there.
6983396	6984256	I would love to.
6984796	6985737	I'd love to go still.
6986077	6986617	I'd love to go.
6987097	6991560	But as Alan says, OK, once we stop doing the Star Trek cruise, we can go other places.
