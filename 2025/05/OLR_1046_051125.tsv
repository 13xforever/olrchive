11896	21124	It is not known yet what the Xbox button will do, but Microsoft is expected to add features like Xbox Game Bar, Play Anywhere functionality, and Game Pass Ultimate.
21184	25028	It could go even deeper, possibly launching the Xbox app on Windows, according to video cards.
25168	33634	It's true, it is not known yet, but if you've ever used an Xbox or even an Xbox controller on Windows, you can probably figure out 90% of what the button will do or logically lead to.
33994	40478	This is the Fluffy Paragraph, and now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this FCC filing and the rest of the week's gaming news.
40718	42800	Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a voice.
45407	47528	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
47568	51611	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
51711	54153	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
54213	61498	We're back once again tonight, May the 11th, 2025, episode number 1046 of our program.
62418	69503	We are, of course, here live to talk about video games, the week in gaming news, gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that good stuff.
69963	70804	My name is Rob Roberts.
70844	72605	I'm here with you every week with my co-host.
72805	75227	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
76568	76628	Hi.
77048	77528	Hello, hello.
77568	78049	How are you doing?
80110	80530	Ask later.
80810	81070	Okay.
81931	85173	I know you're looking forward to the pinball show next week.
85213	86734	You and I were talking about that a little bit earlier.
86754	88955	I was like, ooh, maybe I can actually go this year.
88995	90136	I always wanted to go.
91416	91736	I am.
91796	100742	I'm just trying to figure out how to make ballet rehearsal work on Sunday because I do not know that dance and I kind of don't want to.
101202	102863	Part of me doesn't want to do it, but I committed.
103563	105305	Pinball's always pretty fun.
105385	106646	Those machines are calling your name.
106686	107207	But I get it.
107287	107667	I get it.
107808	110090	It's hard when you say like, oh yeah, I'm going to do this thing.
110630	113433	You want to stay true to it and all that good stuff.
113553	113994	I understand.
114094	119219	At the end of it, I think it's just outside of my skill level.
119719	122422	And so I'm having just that.
123403	125865	And I kind of feel like I've asked for help and I'm not really getting it.
125985	127647	So it is what it is.
127887	129928	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
149918	151120	are doing incredible tonight.
151861	159192	And all the folks that identify as a mother in whatever way that is, I hope you all are having a wonderful Mother's Day.
159893	161716	And that includes Mother Monster, Lady Gaga.
161776	164160	I want to wish Lady Gaga a very happy Mother's Day as well.
165782	167723	I guess we'll get right into the gaming news.
167803	175389	I do want to mention, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
175409	178451	That's also twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
178751	181473	That's the Twitch channel to follow and where we actually broadcast live.
182014	191041	And we are on the air right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, who was on tonight and passed on his technical fail issues to us tonight because we're on take number three.
191061	191921	But hey, things happen.
192862	193662	Let's get into game news.
194463	195844	We're going to start off with this tonight.
197205	198906	Let's talk about a story from Nintendo.
199546	207492	You know, Nintendo has been very, I'll say aggressive when it comes to the legal things around, right?
207992	219740	Something we're not talking about tonight on this show roll, but was also in the news was about how PalWorld has confirmed that they made adjustments to their game based on some of the things that happened in the Nintendo lawsuit.
219760	219980	Right.
220980	225602	and I don't know if they're ultimately trying to settle out of court or what's going on there, but I digress.
226022	230824	We know that Nintendo has always been a pretty litigious company, especially out of the big three.
231804	237506	One could also argue they have some of the biggest intellectual properties out there to protect.
237886	244808	I say as I sit here and I'm wearing a Bowser hat and DarkSakura's VTuber is on a Super Metroid inspired background, right?
244828	246509	Nintendo creates... I can change it.
247049	248290	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
269326	271047	Astrobot, Sackboy.
271347	278692	Yes, there are some family, but, you know, put Astrobot and Sackboy side by side with Mario, Link, Samus.
278732	285137	You know, it's still a different level of, I think, especially if you have to look past your...
286758	287899	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
307772	317356	You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody under the age of 50 that's played, at least in America, Europe, Japan, one of the companies that has a Nintendo distribution.
317376	320777	You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody under 50 that's never played those games.
321237	325279	Now, The Last of Us and even Astro Boy, you name it.
326799	327479	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
346066	361076	My point is that Nintendo somewhat, I believe, acts overly litigious because of the strength of their IPs that we're now seeing leveraged in movies as well with the Mario movie and soon to be a Zelda movie that they really have to protect.
361596	364398	But certainly a lot of that goes to the games as well.
364918	366639	And this is a little bit controversial.
366659	367520	Yeah.
368340	371282	It's a new change in the Nintendo user agreement.
371702	380509	So if you updated the Switch firmware on your Nintendo Switch or you pretty much tried to do anything involving your Nintendo account, you're going to need to accept the new user agreement.
381129	391977	And essentially, this new user agreement, if we want to just cut all the fluff out, we're going to say it's going to break your Switch if it's found with pirated games or mods.
392657	405566	So some folks actually dug through and found that Nintendo said you should not, quote, bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo account services.
406527	412031	If you adapt, reverse engineer, or modify a Nintendo user account, that was in the previous agreement.
412151	414152	Now this new one is in place.
414593	416934	If you do break those rules, Nintendo can, quote,
418155	423038	Make your applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable or whole or in part.
423738	427300	So if... That has nothing to do with playing anything on your own computer.
428161	429361	No, your computer would be different.
429421	430922	So this is piracy on your device.
431022	437726	No, that is because, yeah, Nintendo can't really force you to accept a license agreement on your PC.
437786	443550	I'm trying to think of, I mean, if you visit their website maybe, but otherwise, and yeah, they wouldn't have access to break your computer.
444630	445170	So you're right.
445250	447092	It doesn't stop piracy on...
448352	457476	Let's say I have a great new Dolphin emulator that lets me play F-Zero GX in 4K, even better looking than the GameCube had it.
457777	459778	Nintendo kind of can't stop that.
459858	466401	I mean, legally, if I was making a profit on YouTube with videos of it, they could go after me.
466841	470042	They could go after that front with copyright claiming my videos.
470382	475565	If I was a ROM site distributing those F-Zero GX, they could go after me there.
475965	476445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
498559	511256	If you're using your Switch and you've modded it to sideload games, play pirated games, I don't know if they have a way to hack the Nintendo Switch Online library with more games.
511336	512979	I don't think that's a thing, but who knows.
515381	516342	People figure stuff out.
516362	517442	People do figure stuff out.
517542	520643	And Nintendo is basically saying they have the right to break your device.
521083	524124	Now, I will say, and I'll admit I did it.
524304	526625	I did it long after its life cycle.
527045	532767	But I went back and modded my Wii console, the Nintendo Wii, to check out the Homebrew channel.
532787	536669	And this was well before all the recent allegations against what's going on in the Homebrew channel.
536709	537789	Did it play Just Dance ABBA?
538209	541090	It actually, legitimately, yes.
541490	543150	Because I don't believe they released that game here.
543210	543931	I was there for that.
543951	545731	TRO was there for that.
546031	546431	You were.
546851	549152	Because that game was only released in Europe.
549612	552573	So that was actually a big reason why I modded the Wii.
552693	555354	You know I've always been very anti-region locking.
555794	562276	And so I was like, alright, well if they don't want me to be able to play this legitimately, then I'm just going to open up the Wii and play it that way.
563156	565656	And then that brought the Homebrew channel and all the other stuff with it.
565776	566017	So...
567737	573258	Yeah, I did mod the Nintendo Wii, but did that stop me from spending dollars at Nintendo?
573358	573618	No.
574158	576839	Have I still supported... Did I still buy a Wii U?
576959	577279	Yes.
577419	579539	I mean, I don't know.
579779	594382	I realize it gets into a gray area when we talk about the ethics and all that good stuff, but I don't feel any particular moral sense of lesser because I modded my Wii well after...
595262	598506	or well towards the end of the Wii's life cycle when the Wii U is about to come out.
599767	600988	S2100 Matt, that's a good point.
601108	605373	S2100 Matt says, I think some folks hacked their Wii to play President Cat.
605873	609077	Oops, maybe we did have some impact.
610936	612057	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
640251	640731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
664636	665337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
693138	698485	and Skateboard Down the Streets of the City or whatever were the minigames in that thing, which I think was one of those.
698845	703932	Yeah, PodCulture says, now you have Stray and Little Kitty Big City.
704613	706816	We here at Orange Lawns Radio, we're just ahead of our time.
709073	710634	We were just a stray.
710654	711836	You're welcome for stray.
711876	712696	We're going to take credit for that.
712716	713117	I'm kidding.
713217	713757	I'm kidding.
714098	714518	I'm kidding.
715439	715739	Anyway.
716880	717321	Really?
717501	718682	I didn't know that, DJ Ranma.
719102	724848	DJ Ranma S in chat says, ZenkaiCon 2008 actually had President Cat in the game room.
727250	731514	and you're going to look me dead ass in the eye and say that that game didn't sell any copies.
732114	734756	You're going to dead ass look me in the eye and say that game didn't sell any copies.
734776	739220	Well, maybe that's where piracy got the game over here in the US.
739541	740661	But that was never endorsed.
740702	741562	That was never the point.
741983	745225	The point was to get that game released in the US, which unfortunately never happened.
745526	749149	But we did get the attention of the nice social media staff on Twitter.
749209	750650	I remember those back when Twitter was fun.
750690	752692	I have no idea what's going on here, but thank you.
753052	754814	Yeah, I remember that response.
755114	757616	We have no idea why this is happening, but thank you.
759538	760899	Back when Twitter was fun.
761159	761900	Remember those days?
762180	762561	Oh, boy.
762581	764182	No, back when Twitter was.
765083	765824	That's true, too.
765864	766804	Back when Twitter was.
768266	768546	All right.
768666	768946	Anyway.
770063	773685	We know that Nintendo has always had a very strong anti-piracy stance.
774025	779107	We all know what happened about Yuzu and when Nintendo has gone after them.
779128	780788	There was Ryu Jinx and all this stuff.
780848	786691	Nintendo really tries to whack-a-mole with these emulators as they come up and so forth.
786991	791394	I can't say I'm surprised to see it, to be honest.
792134	796056	My concern is what's going to happen when somebody hits a false positive?
796616	797956	You just know that's coming.
798417	806459	Somebody's system is going to get bricked and cue the 90 minute YouTube they're going to make that says Nintendo illegally banned me.
806999	808920	Nintendo illegally banned me.
810120	812821	And here's the list of all the things I never did wrong.
813001	818682	And then it will come out like three years later that they did indeed sideload something and just didn't think they'd get caught.
819382	820503	But, you know, in...
821343	826491	In fairness, there could be the false flag that comes out somewhere because we don't know how this detection system is going to work.
826511	826972	I doubt that.
827993	828654	I doubt that.
829616	830797	I kind of doubt it too.
831619	836726	I think what Nintendo needs is, because here's what I worry about.
837805	845110	A lot of times today you'll hear that people get banned from, I don't know, Pokemon Go or EA Online or whatever.
845170	851854	People get banned and they have like no recourse to figure out why they were banned or how to appeal that ban.
852154	855877	Because companies don't like to share the reason why people were banned.
856277	864542	And I'm assuming that's because, I don't know, they don't want other people to... I don't know what the reason is or thought behind it, but they don't like to share those types of things.
864963	866484	So my concern is...
867604	881392	If, and I'm with you, Jamie, that I don't think this is going to happen, but if it happens even once to somebody who didn't deserve it, that person has the right to be able to go to Nintendo and say, you brick this shit when you shouldn't have, unbrick it.
881912	884093	And there should be that process set up.
884494	888436	And I just know, I already know, I already know, that's not going to be a thing.
888716	889576	It's not going to be a thing.
889837	891998	Nintendo's not going to have a system set up like that.
892796	895598	Now, I guess that would mean cue the lawsuit eventually.
895618	898479	Unless they want to have their ass handed to them at some point.
898579	901301	But even so, there's not going to be any recourse.
901441	903742	Yeah, complain all you want on the internet.
903762	904683	Nintendo will give a shit.
905123	907284	Yeah, or talk to our AI support bot.
908725	909786	That'll be the recourse.
909846	915009	Talk to our AI support bot who will just keep parroting the same, like, five... Have you turned it off and on again?
918775	919516	Now, do me a favor.
919576	922882	Turn it off again and wait for 30 seconds and then turn it on again.
926487	928968	DJ Ranma S says if they brick it, there's a way to recover.
929288	942573	You know, that's another thing I'm curious about is wouldn't the piracy community and we'll say the hacking modding community, wouldn't they be the ones to come up with a here's how to unbrick your switch?
943213	944253	So you've been bricked.
944473	945494	Here's how to unbrick it.
947754	948995	Honestly, hold on.
949275	949435	Yeah.
951359	958261	I truly think all it's going to be is that you just have to go through a system restore that removes any sideloaded whatever.
958361	959481	Your account gets restored.
959621	960121	End of story.
960601	963782	Like a factory reset by pushing different buttons?
963802	964062	Yeah.
964582	966862	I had to do that to my Evercade when I first got it.
966882	971323	I don't know if you remember, but when I got my Evercade... I mean, any device can be factory reset.
971463	971743	Yeah.
972324	976244	I mean, you can do that to any phone, your computer.
977145	979405	If it's got an OS on it, it can be restored.
979892	985637	Do you think that Nintendo could go the lengths of like the Mac address of the device banning it from online?
985677	988239	So even if you did factory reset it, you can't do anything with it?
989481	989701	Offline?
989721	991162	I don't think that's going to be necessary.
991222	993784	And besides that, there's ways around that too.
994185	994985	I guess that's true.
995026	995746	I guess that's true.
997868	998288	We'll see.
998489	1001631	And also, Ranchan, there are ways around a boot loop.
1002569	1008031	I do feel like it's a giant game of chess between Nintendo and the hacking and piracy communities.
1008331	1011812	And I want to make clear, I don't endorse piracy of new games.
1012932	1018974	I think games that are no longer available at retail, there ought to be some sort of way to preserve those games.
1019354	1022055	And I think we need to kind of find that medium as an industry with that.
1022155	1025255	But I don't support the piracy of current games.
1026476	1030157	But I do understand the desire of, hey, someday
1030837	1042236	someday Nintendo is going to pull the Switch store just like they did the Wii store and just like they did the Wii U store but I will still want to be able to experience the games of that time especially the ones that I own so
1044540	1049844	Anyway, we'll see legally how this goes and what systems actually get bricked.
1050445	1052447	We'll be watching this.
1052567	1054568	There may just not even be anything to worry about.
1054969	1055789	Yeah, that's true.
1056710	1060934	Just because it's in the end-user license agreement doesn't mean Nintendo's going to do it.
1061454	1069160	It just means they want that ability to do it, although an end-user license agreement has, I don't believe, ever been...
1070347	1071267	Looked at in court.
1071687	1073408	Because these things always settle.
1073908	1077349	So it's funny, we kind of say, I think Nintendo could have a court case coming.
1077649	1079569	Would they or would they just settle?
1079689	1081530	Because that's what always happens is they settle.
1082170	1082870	Be very interesting.
1083410	1083970	Very, very interesting.
1084850	1088551	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1088651	1093713	Hopefully, ethically and sourced by a store or otherwise.
1093833	1094773	No, I've just been...
1095513	1119917	You know, playing from some dark dungeon where I have like 50,000 old CRT monitors from all the systems I've been hacking through time I want to visit this dark dungeon, that sounds fucking rad Ironically, I think there is a game called Dark Dungeon You don't want to go there But, I mean, I played, speaking of dark dungeons, I've been playing Dead by Daylight
1122392	1127535	Uh, kind of having a, I don't know, I'm getting kind of tired of DBD.
1127695	1131157	I know blasphemy, blasphemy, blasphemy.
1131497	1132257	Were you interested?
1132458	1133418	I don't think it's in our show role.
1133438	1136440	Were you interested in anything that they announced at their anniversary update?
1136620	1137660	Because they did their big meeting.
1137680	1138401	I'm interested.
1138501	1142263	Ninth anniversary, because they finally unveiled Springtrap, right?
1142363	1142863	Springtrap.
1143423	1143783	Yeah.
1144224	1146225	And they got, what's his face from the movie?
1146325	1146925	Matthew Lillard.
1147145	1147385	Yeah.
1147586	1148046	Does the voice.
1148106	1148426	Yeah.
1148506	1148746	Yeah.
1149046	1150287	That was more interesting.
1150347	1151828	Not just doing the voice.
1151928	1154650	He is the face in motion capture.
1154710	1155210	Right.
1155290	1156891	There's a skin that actually has him.
1157031	1157671	That's pretty cool.
1158072	1158912	Exactly.
1160653	1165736	And then they left a teaser for
1166741	1173688	for what one of the upcoming killer chapters is, and they figured what it is, and then I promptly forgot what it was.
1174589	1179654	But I want to say that Polyester said something about it.
1180355	1184419	I don't know, they kept making some fun jabs at him because he was there.
1186321	1188543	I'll have to look at
1190001	1192185	I like some of the cosmetic stuff coming out there's
1202708	1206050	There's going to be some very interesting things happening.
1206090	1208772	I like the Witcher stuff that's happening.
1209572	1212013	The Boulay Brothers artist skin is fire.
1212374	1214235	I really like what they did with that.
1214255	1214615	Oh, yes, it is.
1214695	1216996	The Huntress, I could take her, you know, take her leave.
1217977	1226842	But yeah, there's, I'm pretty, pretty, pretty, I'm happy about it.
1226962	1228043	You know, don't get me wrong.
1228926	1257012	but at the same time I'm also just like I really want to see what they're doing to fix some of the things oh yeah so the thing is Walking Dead oh that makes so much sense though they've been talking about that forever when I say they I mean the community rumors have been buzzing about that forever they did some he sang something at the end hmm
1258623	1264647	and so that they've left hints in the event.
1265928	1266489	Interesting.
1266569	1268350	I'm assuming it would be Negan who's the killer?
1268370	1270171	The speculation is Walking Dead.
1270411	1270671	Okay.
1271112	1272212	Interesting.
1273533	1280958	But I'm pretty... I don't know.
1281018	1284100	I'm just going to say at least the haystacking was kept.
1286022	1286202	So...
1286861	1288642	I have a question about the Dragula thing.
1289022	1292462	I saw some of the highlights on social media, but I didn't watch the whole presentation.
1292823	1295563	But I think I watched the Boulay brothers reveal.
1295643	1296564	I watched that whole thing.
1296924	1301205	Did they ever credit Asia Consent for that Huntress outfit?
1301245	1308127	Because I'm almost positive the language they were using was, as seen on the show, that we designed through our show, that this was on the show.
1308167	1311307	And I was kind of like, why aren't you saying Asia Consent?
1311327	1312028	I don't remember.
1312048	1313068	I was working at the same time.
1313088	1313508	Okay.
1314088	1314408	I don't know.
1314728	1329674	I could have missed it, but I swear when I watched the walkback, I was going, maybe they were worried that some people wouldn't get the pun because unfortunately on the internet, they were worried that people would take the name Asia Consent a little literally.
1329734	1331115	Maybe they were worried about saying the name.
1331635	1336857	But I thought it was a little weird that she wasn't credited, at least again, in my recollection.
1336897	1337817	And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
1337857	1338178	Sorry.
1338658	1338898	But...
1339738	1342059	She made that Huntress thing for a challenge.
1342419	1345300	Well, they showed her directly.
1347741	1355044	I was sort of half paying attention to some of that because I was trying to get work done.
1355644	1356865	But I had it all on the side.
1357885	1360286	Well, anyway, the drag performer's name is Asia Consent.
1360306	1361066	She's out of Portland.
1361106	1361987	She's very talented.
1362127	1362427	Thank you.
1364826	1366527	Also, I don't think there's anything bad about the name.
1367908	1371249	Well, here's the problem, Jamie.
1371969	1372890	Straight people.
1373150	1375491	It's straight people.
1375511	1378592	People are too focused on fucking.
1379312	1381373	Not everything has to be about that.
1381433	1383394	This is also consent for legal agreements.
1384525	1389969	I don't mean you watching, and I don't mean you listening on the podcast feed.
1390289	1393491	You know, if you're an ally, you know I don't mean you.
1393511	1394692	They could have said it.
1394712	1396554	And on top of that, it's an 18-plus game.
1396934	1397834	Yeah, it's true.
1398335	1402458	Technically, so there would have been no problem saying anything about it.
1402538	1404959	You do have to be a certain age to consent to play the game.
1407161	1407441	Anyway.
1407481	1408842	Yeah.
1411484	1413946	Man, I'm a little hangry, so...
1415273	1416556	I got the vibe tonight.
1417658	1418420	There's chicken.
1420103	1420683	Oh, chicken.
1421804	1422104	Alright.
1423666	1426468	You gotta come here for chicken.
1427048	1431172	Anyway, so I played some Mass Effect.
1432032	1433533	Got through the Noveria mission.
1433654	1434634	I didn't take Liara.
1434694	1437296	This is the first time I haven't taken Liara to Noveria.
1437897	1441620	Well, I started off with her and then I was like, oh wait, I need someone who can hack.
1441720	1443241	And I don't use Ashley that much.
1443681	1447845	So I brought Ashley and Tali and I was like, oh wait, this is why I bring Liara.
1449495	1472343	and I usually want to punch Ashley in the face on that mission even though I always kill Caden because he's Captain Cardboard and I like Ashley better in the later games because she overcomes her xenophobia and you never find that out if you don't let her live
1473416	1473896	And it's nice.
1474096	1477858	She has a lot more personal development as a character than Caden does.
1478479	1479379	That's just facts.
1480300	1483582	He kind of stays the same person he is.
1483642	1486783	And she actually grows out of her xenophobia, which I really enjoy seeing.
1487444	1489505	And you find out more about her family and all this.
1490305	1493247	But anyway, that's why I choose to let her live.
1493387	1494828	That and honestly...
1496293	1497433	I'm a little bit of a mood.
1497453	1497534	Yeah.
1523363	1525264	But I don't know.
1526244	1538792	I could never figure out what it was about him that just aggravated me until it finally just dawned on me in the middle of trying to explain it to somebody else last night that I just don't think he's got an engaging personality.
1539212	1544255	Well, you know, my husband only has him tattooed on himself, so I don't have any strong feelings or anything.
1545956	1546637	You know, though...
1548246	1554470	I also have zero attraction to him as a character, so I'm a little bit biased that way.
1556251	1557471	So, anyway.
1562244	1578364	I've played some Palia I've been getting back into my modding a lot for Palia and I'm working on my property and trying to save money so I can buy another property but I wouldn't use the default one because I'm trying to boundary break because there is this wall and you can see something behind the wall and I've broken that boundary once and I need to do it again
1579380	1593033	but I have to have $100,000 monies to do that I've been doing Fruit Mountain just, you know, my Mahjong game on the go just like the usual stuff
1594747	1619615	I don't know, I just really haven't wanted to branch out more I went back to go read the original Chilling Adventures of Sabrina comic and I need to find the rest of it It goes so much differently than this show did It's a lot darker and I'm kind of here for it Nice So, it's really good But yeah, that's it
1620990	1621711	My gaming week.
1622612	1630484	I've, of course, still been playing a lot of Diablo 4 because that game just gives me the serotonin boost that I desire with clicking and killing the demons.
1630624	1636173	I'm up to Torment 2 in this season, which I thought climbing the Torment ladder was supposed to be harder this season.
1636533	1637014	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1654316	1664762	But even even in their builds, I do find things where I'm like, this doesn't add up or I feel like this was not changed from a previous draft where maybe their line of thinking about what skills they should take.
1665662	1669344	You know, I don't want to get too far in the weeds on it, but even sometimes and that's fine.
1669624	1672926	That site prints a ton of builds and they're always updating.
1672966	1673867	So it's not a read.
1673927	1679310	It's just, you know, I always like to kind of go, yes, I'll use this as a blueprint, but I'll challenge the thinking.
1679350	1680130	Sometimes I'll be like,
1680350	1683895	I'm not sure I logically get that, so I want to try doing this instead.
1684275	1686719	Let me try this out in a nightmare dungeon and see if I clear it faster.
1687019	1688060	So I'll do little things like that.
1689222	1693247	But I love that their site sets a blueprint and gives me an idea which direction to go.
1693908	1695130	And there's lots of sites just like it.
1695230	1697573	Icy Veins is one I've used in the past too, and there's lots of other sites.
1697973	1712559	So I'm playing a necromancer this season and I'm doing a minion build, which is basically it's very similar to in Diablo 3 when you would have the witch doctors minion build that would just the minions would kill everything on the screen and you only have to focus on bosses and big things.
1712820	1716541	It's very, very, very similar to that ultimately in execution how it plays.
1716781	1717902	But I'm having a fun time with it.
1717942	1720203	Like it's just it's just so fun tearing through all the monsters.
1720763	1749105	but I did play one other game this week very important that I finally mentioned that I got to Claire Obscure Expedition 33 finally started playing that this week and I threatened last week on the show I said I know I'm overdue because this game's been out for two weeks it's right up my alley but just with all the traveling I've been doing stuff yeah it's um it's it she is that bitch that's French that's that's my uh that's my summary of Claire Claire Obscure she is that bitch I've been watching Nick play
1749895	1751877	Yeah, there's a lot of streamers playing that right now.
1753018	1753778	Including Nick, yeah.
1753798	1754519	With a baguette.
1754899	1757601	But it's great.
1758222	1760824	It's incredibly engrossing from the beginning.
1761204	1763987	The prologue is very, like, wow.
1764447	1765808	Like, just kind of pulls you in.
1765868	1772334	And then a sequence of events happens shortly after the prologue where I was just like, am I watching the movie up?
1772674	1774776	Why didn't anybody warn me about this?
1774996	1776237	Jesus Christ.
1776317	1778639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1802936	1811360	If you are one of those people that was like Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon were underrated fucking Xbox games, those games deserve better.
1811440	1813081	Those games always deserved a sequel.
1813561	1817403	This game just got served up to you on a platter.
1817723	1818284	This is it.
1818544	1819324	This is it, folks.
1819464	1820725	This is the game you've been waiting for.
1821345	1821625	DarkSakura,
1836403	1836883	and DarkSakura.com.
1864705	1870628	I went to the website to kind of start to read it and I instantly had spoiled for me who all the playable characters were.
1870988	1872349	And I was like, you know what?
1872609	1873510	I should have known better.
1873890	1874790	That was my bad.
1875050	1876531	I'm not going to do that in the future.
1877031	1879172	And I just, I'm playing on easy mode.
1879212	1880653	So how bad can I fuck it up?
1880953	1882014	How bad can I fuck it up?
1882034	1882934	This is interesting.
1883174	1883415	Yeah.
1883855	1888037	Because I already own Dead Cells and there is a two-piece bundle.
1889338	1892159	I can actually just get the game for like five bucks cheaper online.
1892299	1892679	Oh, nice.
1894121	1895582	I know you're not a Game Pass person.
1895682	1897304	That's how I'm doing it.
1898064	1898525	Game Pass.
1898705	1899746	Oh, the outfits.
1900106	1900907	I'm on a Mac.
1901127	1902348	The outfits are a nothing burger.
1902949	1903669	I wouldn't worry about it.
1903749	1907192	I mean, I shouldn't say a nothing burger, but it's a single player game.
1907833	1913918	And some people have actually said from equipping the outfits, it takes them out of the experience.
1915320	1919044	I will say very early on in the game, I don't think this is going to ruin anything.
1919084	1920286	It's during the prologue.
1921227	1922408	I actually found an area.
1922428	1924591	So if you didn't find this, hunt around a little more.
1925092	1928015	I found a little hidden area where I battled a mime.
1928656	1932501	And then in defeating the mime, I got an outfit that's like a mime outfit.
1932921	1933061	Yeah.
1933081	1933181	Yeah.
1933221	1933341	Yeah.
1954502	1956963	and I will say I do love the hairstyles that I did.
1957043	1959464	I did change the main character's hairstyle very soon.
1960464	1963545	Yeah, SGO100Matt says this game is a love letter to JRPGs.
1963825	1971508	This game is a love letter to games like I and this game is going I don't know because again, I feel like we said the same thing about Baldur's Gate 3.
1972648	1973649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1992327	1994529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2017148	2039495	it holds its fucking own against those series even in the brief bits I've experienced so far and I know I've just scratched the surface but it is itching all of those same it is scratching all of those same itches that a Final Fantasy game scratches so I I don't see how this game does not win game of the year because this game is such a fucking disruptor
2041277	2043918	Bobby in chat says, I'm struggling with the dodges and the parries.
2045739	2047099	You have to be playing on easy mode.
2047139	2048099	I know you, Bobby Blackwolf.
2048139	2052021	It does make the timing a lot easier from what I understand, but it is tight.
2052361	2054362	The parries are tight.
2055142	2058943	So I would say if you can't do the parries, focus on the dodges first.
2059363	2063425	And the only way the dodges, you start to... It's kind of like...
2064065	2076209	You know how when you see a Final Fantasy monster enough times, you go, oh, this is a zombie, I know from prior experience, they're weak to cures, they're weak to fire, so if I use those spells on the zombies, I'll get through them.
2076409	2077610	You sort of learn those things.
2078090	2080051	It's very similar with their attacks.
2080511	2089494	Like, there's one mob early on in the game that says, this mob does a fast attack, and then this mob does a slow attack, and based on what it's telling you,
2090634	2097616	It's the exact same animation every time, and as you start to see it, you start to learn how to dodge it.
2097936	2104237	But I fucking love how you can start the fight by aiming your gun and shooting a weak point for massive damage.
2105737	2109298	The flourish in this game is incredible, and obviously it looks great.
2109798	2111079	I'm sure many of you have seen screenshots.
2111099	2111379	This game...
2113519	2114721	She is that bitch.
2115161	2116383	She is that girl.
2116923	2117604	All the hype.
2118085	2119446	It's for a reason, y'all.
2120207	2125193	I'm sure there's somebody out there that's going to be like, eh, I don't like that.
2125914	2126274	Okay.
2126875	2127155	Okay.
2127576	2128817	Ooh, she's different.
2128897	2129418	We get it.
2130985	2134628	But for the game industry as a whole, this game is pretty fucking incredible.
2135148	2142093	And I'm very interested to see what type of ripple effect this is going to have on the industry.
2143614	2148277	My understanding is this story was already optioned for a movie.
2149078	2158704	Somebody got an inside presentation on this and scooped up those movie rights because they're smart, because the story's
2159605	2160666	Again, even early on.
2161987	2163909	But I also hear the story can be very triggering.
2164009	2166551	I just saw that on Blue Sky today, is that there's actually some issues.
2166591	2170034	There's some pretty intense stuff, I guess, in the game.
2170475	2174358	And I don't know enough about the story, but it can be pretty overwhelming.
2176059	2181084	But it does seem like the type of thing that would serve itself very well as either a movie or a TV show.
2181484	2183626	So somebody snatched those rights up.
2183706	2185047	So this is going to be out there.
2185988	2190189	Oh yeah, S2100Matt says Charlie Cox is the main character voice who played Daredevil.
2191069	2194370	And then Ben Starr also plays a major character who I don't think I've gotten to yet.
2194970	2197111	I love... What's that second character's name?
2197171	2197551	Lume?
2197991	2198311	Luna?
2199131	2202472	She is like hot.
2202612	2203092	I'm just gonna say it.
2203112	2203633	She's hot.
2204033	2208294	Like... I was pretty sure I heard Jennifer English when I was watching Nick play.
2208314	2208674	Mmm.
2209853	2212994	It's just, yeah, great characters.
2213454	2220536	Look, if you like RPGs, I'm assuming you are already playing this game.
2220716	2229118	But I'm just going to tell you, if you've been holding off, if you like these RPGs, these types of games, go fucking play this game.
2229438	2231318	It is really that good.
2231638	2234099	However, now I'm going to tell you my one complaint.
2235283	2237024	I can't say 10 out of 10.
2237524	2238924	I got to say 9.9 out of 10.
2239545	2241905	I have one major fucking complaint with this game.
2242205	2242886	Anyone want to guess?
2243606	2244306	Anyone want to guess?
2245026	2245647	Anyone want to guess?
2246567	2247287	I'm going to tell you, Mike.
2247367	2248128	One complaint with the game.
2249508	2250728	No fucking maps.
2252129	2252649	And I know.
2253109	2254030	I saw the interview.
2254410	2260132	I saw the interviews where they said they made the choice to do it for whatever editorial reason.
2260212	2260292	No.
2263466	2269749	How many times have we been told we don't want something, but really we do?
2270229	2279293	In fact, isn't the mere existence of Claire Obscure a whole response to Square Enix saying you don't want a turn-based game with modern graphics?
2280461	2283465	and I'm telling you, yes, we want fucking maps.
2284206	2285849	I'm going to be honest.
2286349	2291937	I don't know if I just have a problem with spatial awareness or spatiality.
2293520	2295783	I actually see the lack of maps
2296704	2298305	I'm going to say it as an accessibility issue.
2299166	2301227	I think the lack of maps is an accessibility issue.
2301967	2304669	And I think having maps is going to make your game more accessible.
2305049	2307731	And I know some of you out there are going to say, well, then draw your own map.
2308071	2310253	Okay, princess, we're not on the days.
2310273	2310793	Time to mod.
2311133	2312834	We're not on the, yes, yes.
2312954	2313935	I want a map mod.
2314615	2315976	Oh, that, oh, yes to that.
2316397	2318098	Here's, because here's the thing.
2319395	2322137	We're not in two dimensions anymore, sweetie.
2322798	2327501	You can't map things on graph paper like we used to do in Metroid and Kid Icarus Dungeons and stuff like that.
2327762	2328802	We're past those days.
2329123	2331244	Doom broke that in 1995.
2331584	2332825	We're in 3D now, honey.
2333366	2337149	So I can't just draw my own map.
2338567	2341689	So, and it looks like some folks in chat agree with me.
2341969	2343450	Mish says, thank you, that's my only gripe.
2343490	2344431	Fifth Dream says, yes.
2345252	2348974	Yeah, the lack of maps is ridiculous.
2349374	2352276	And whatever their editorial reason is for it, they are wrong.
2354558	2358440	So there actually is an active request right now for a map mod.
2359141	2359481	Love it.
2360462	2361843	I hope the mod community does it.
2362783	2363584	I will install that, 100%.
2365245	2365585	Thank you.
2365825	2366786	Thank you, modders.
2366986	2367687	We salute you.
2368803	2369804	Happy Modder's Day.
2370944	2372265	It's all the modders out there.
2373486	2373826	All right.
2375087	2376127	So, yeah.
2377408	2379990	All the modders that have come before.
2380410	2381131	All right.
2381851	2382171	Anyway.
2382591	2386294	Has this Joe 100 Matt say maps like the song?
2387753	2389595	They don't love you like I love you.
2390116	2390476	Wait.
2391598	2392359	Wait on the maps.
2392759	2393060	Wait.
2393160	2394442	They don't love you like I love you.
2394562	2395183	I love maps.
2395703	2395964	All right.
2396024	2398307	Anyway, enough deep references.
2398487	2400370	Enough Claire Obscure references.
2401171	2403834	Let's get into some news.
2405290	2407951	Now that we're done with our gaming week, let's get into more news.
2407991	2409031	We talked about Nintendo.
2409251	2411391	Let's talk about Microsoft and Xbox.
2412132	2412552	Leaks.
2413112	2413652	We got them.
2414052	2416533	We got a new Microsoft leak.
2416613	2422174	It is what the Microsoft X-branded handheld is going to look like.
2422574	2426335	It's actually an Asus ROG Alley 2 handheld.
2427095	2430956	So these are going to be the things that are Xbox branded if these leaks are to be believed.
2431056	2434297	But you're literally looking at a piece of hardware in these leaks.
2434737	2440261	This is going to be a very hard thing to dispute, and I think this is very a where there's smoke, there's fire situation.
2440541	2443363	We know the Xbox handhelds have been rumored for a long time.
2443983	2448926	Why wouldn't this be the type of thing to announce during the Keelyverse, whether it's this summer or this winter?
2449387	2451668	I think probably this summer would make a lot of sense.
2452249	2456011	So an Xbox-branded gaming console seems to be on the way.
2457452	2460894	So apparently there are some specs for this.
2460954	2463676	They have 7-inch 120Hz displays.
2464356	2478404	The Xbox version of the ROG Ally 2, because there's two different versions of this, so the Xbox-branded version will have an AMD 8-core 36W Ryzen Z2 Extreme and 64GB of LPDDR5X memory.
2478844	2481586	And then the regular specs are different, we'll say that.
2481926	2506000	so um the Xbox branded one looks to have just a little bit more oomph there uh but we see that there's an Xbox button and so we assume that Microsoft will add in things like the Xbox game bar play anywhere functionality which could be huge um playing games through the cloud on this portable device especially from your own Xbox like lying in bed tapping into the Xbox downstairs on this thing could be very interesting um
2506960	2512985	So yeah, we'll have to wait and see what all the details really are, but we know this is coming.
2513205	2523712	And it seemed like between the Switch 2s, the Steam Decks of the world, it doesn't surprise me that Microsoft wants to get into this space too.
2524193	2529577	So, Rinmari68k in chat says, okay, but I'd like to know how long the battery can last.
2529977	2530818	Valid question.
2530838	2532019	I should have run eight C-cells.
2534039	2534879	Like a Game Gear.
2535239	2538922	I feel like three-fourths of the way to Game Gear was the batteries.
2540342	2544065	But even the Steam Deck, I feel, runs through battery charge real fast.
2544105	2546286	But of course, it depends on what you're playing, right?
2546726	2553570	Like Tetris the Grandmaster, not a game – and I love that game – but not a game that's pushing the graphics card to its extreme, right?
2554130	2554611	Whereas –
2555131	2559281	Claire Obscure, I guess we'll say, might be a game that's going to push the limit a little more.
2559602	2561988	So the battery life is going to depend on what you play in.
2562068	2563191	That's going to be a big part of that.
2565017	2568259	Anyway, yeah, I think an Xbox handheld could be really neat.
2568459	2571261	I don't know if we need all of those handhelds.
2571741	2578925	Like personally, do I need a Steam Deck and a Switch 2 and a mobile phone and an Xbox?
2579285	2584949	I don't know if I need that, but let's see what the case is that Microsoft's going to make on why I need to have one of those.
2585189	2586490	Does it make phone calls too?
2586630	2587430	Is it an N-Gage?
2587670	2588351	Is it a Taco?
2588391	2589411	Is it the Xbox N-Gage?
2589692	2591853	Technically, we don't need any of them.
2592403	2594545	Oh, dear lord, I'm so glad I got out of this game.
2622830	2642718	in the 90s and sold all of my cards and got a lot of money for them same and that's no shade my wallet is celebrating all my black bordered cards my moxes my dual lands my legends y'all know I'm talking about magic the moment I bring up you know the alphas the betas the reserves all those legends
2644085	2652958	Anyway, they have unveiled new Magic the Gathering and Final Fantasy cards.
2654159	2655582	And, I mean, these are pretty.
2655822	2659928	I don't know that I would buy them other than that they're pretty.
2661247	2667231	but there are some new cards being added in for the Final Fantasy series.
2667271	2679478	We've got like Vivi, Cloud, we have Bahamut Summon, we have Zanarkand, we have Vanille, Squall, Tifa, Renoir, Lightning, I mean like so many.
2679518	2687804	We have Kayn, we have Furion, the Rose Warrior, we have, you know, one of the Sids, Cecil,
2689077	2692142	Chaos, like just so many things.
2693844	2700294	But they're going to have some special mechanics to go along with those play styles.
2700354	2701456	So there you go.
2703407	2704568	Nice.
2704828	2711193	Yeah, as a Final Fantasy fan, I look at this and I go, oh, I have to have the Balthier and Fran card.
2711614	2715637	But then I'm like, ooh, I should get back into Magic the Gathering.
2716017	2722423	And then I hear my wallet screaming at me going, don't you even fucking think about it, you stupid capitalist bitch.
2722763	2724784	Do not fall for this stuff.
2725165	2727567	So I'm just going to pretend I never saw any of this.
2729151	2738178	Okay, I do think it's... I really like the artwork they did for Terra's card because it's a mono art.
2739559	2744163	But, I mean, it's still magic and I'm not gonna... I know.
2744344	2747927	I still almost want to get the cards just to have in one of those display cases.
2748347	2749248	It's like baseball cards.
2749268	2750329	I'll never use them for anything.
2750349	2751490	That's how they get you, Rob.
2751590	2752731	I know, I know.
2752811	2753772	It is, it is.
2755387	2771776	and then yeah my wallet will be like how dare you can't you just stick to the free Pokemon cards and the trading card pocket which by the way I finally fell off that game I'm sorry if I stopped sending you cheers or whatever they are in those I finally fell off that game I haven't opened it in months so sorry but yeah
2774833	2777694	Well, I never got on it, so I'm not losing anything.
2777834	2779595	It's for the best.
2780236	2780496	All right.
2781636	2791901	Let's move on to something we can all get on board with, and that is our game developers forming unions for their rights and their protections.
2792281	2795523	And the developers behind the popular video game Overwatch...
2796483	2798524	Is it Overwatch 2 still or Overwatch?
2798544	2800965	Because I noticed the media is just calling it Overwatch again.
2801025	2802346	But anyway, I digress.
2802686	2806588	The developers behind the Overwatch franchise have unionized.
2807309	2812691	So the Activision Blizzard Overwatch team made a union under the CWA.
2812731	2814812	That's the Communication Workers of America.
2815293	2819555	It is recognized by parent company Microsoft, which to be fair, Microsoft...
2819875	2820795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2844185	2858533	So, again, in the CWA's announcement on Friday, quote, a neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal.
2859693	2865577	Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions.
2866177	2867338	So, there you go.
2869079	2871400	And hopefully this means, you know, they'll...
2872777	2873838	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2892714	2893074	DarkSakura
2922250	2932776	So let's go back to something that we're into, and that is seeing the old stuff come back, right?
2934037	2935078	We're always dealing with it.
2935999	2938680	You remember that there was the attempt to try to bring back Echo the Dolphin?
2940161	2943422	There was a Kickstarter that kind of failed pretty bad.
2945924	2952947	But Echo the Dolphin is getting a remaster, and not just the first game, but also Tides of Time is getting a remaster.
2953507	2955728	And there's a note about a new
2955908	2957710	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2972025	2994274	he said me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Echo the Dolphin and Ties of Times game then we will make a third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities and then he linked a brand new website with a countdown scheduled to end on April 25th, 2026 so there you go we'll see what happens
2995041	2999684	I find SSJ100Matt's comment in chat highly relatable, saying, I never beat Echo.
2999804	3002026	I would just rent it and swim around most of the time.
3002246	3002566	Yes.
3005149	3012076	Actually, at a recent little gamer gathering with friends, Echo the Dolphin got brought up and played a little bit.
3012116	3014158	And it was like, dang, this game was hard.
3014578	3017381	Like, for a game about a fucking dolphin, this game is hard.
3018081	3020303	So, as, you know, a lot of games of that era were.
3020404	3021465	It was freaking gorgeous.
3021645	3021845	Yeah.
3021945	3022686	Oh, yeah, it's gorgeous.
3022726	3025428	And, you know, everything is about memorizing the patterns at the end of the day.
3025468	3027050	But it was a hard game.
3027630	3027811	Yeah.
3028803	3029083	All right.
3029583	3030724	Well, let's talk about the Switch 2.
3031064	3033584	It's interesting that we're already talking about sales.
3033744	3034064	I don't know.
3034184	3036025	I found this story to be a little bit weird.
3036165	3036845	I got to be honest.
3036865	3037705	I'm going to explain why.
3038266	3046468	So apparently Nintendo, I guess, may be revising some of their sales estimates on this.
3047168	3056032	So in the latest earnings report, they projected that 15 million Switch 2 units would be sold in its first year through March 2026.
3057392	3059053	So its first fiscal year, if you will.
3059613	3064675	But that's lower than what the analysts were predicting was 16.8 million.
3065115	3072018	And what's being blamed for this is, well, it's a little bit inferred, but it's all this uncertainty around the tariffs.
3072458	3073098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3097065	3098606	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3114781	3115382	pre-orders.
3115462	3118744	So we already know how many are selling through the viewers because it's, it's been limited.
3118804	3132154	It's been capped, but I guess where it gets, you know, a little muddy is how many switch twos are there really going to be able to bring over here to the States between now, you know, what's already here and the holiday season.
3132475	3142342	And I can understand that that's, what's maybe muddying the waters and lowering this prediction because already less boats are coming over here because of this whole ridiculous tariff situation.
3142582	3143923	So interesting.
3144544	3144604	Um,
3145886	3158086	But yeah, they are saying in Japan, the company received 2.2 million applications for pre-orders and Nintendo said that far exceeds their expectations.
3160063	3163064	But Shintaro Furukawa did say that U.S.
3163104	3166304	tariffs are one area the company does not have control over.
3166884	3177526	Furukawa did say that Nintendo's current policy is to recognize the tariffs as a cost, but if additional tariffs necessitate a price increase in the U.S., then demand in the country is going to fall.
3178326	3186668	The rising prices of daily expenses and food could also have an impact on what, you know, like Jamie said earlier, you don't need games.
3187188	3190509	You need food, you need water, but you don't need games.
3190889	3194689	And that turns into a lot of difficult household decisions for people.
3195490	3200430	So they are expecting 45 million Switch 2 games to be sold through the financial year.
3201571	3209912	And if you want to put things in comparison, 150 million Switch consoles have been sold to date, and that was 17.79 million in the first 13 months.
3214113	3220658	So the Switch 2 is on a similar pace, but we'll see how this tariff situation fucks everything up.
3221987	3232438	Ranmari68 says, I can't wait to pay an extra $70 for my Gradius Origins Japanese version, but at least it will arrive in August instead of 2027 or whatever.
3232818	3236421	If it's coming from Japan, it isn't going to be 145% or whatever.
3236722	3237482	It's only, I think, 10%.
3238183	3238704	It could be high.
3239124	3241286	I can't make any sense of this bullshit anymore.
3241326	3244870	I don't expect anyone to be able to, but I don't think it's that high.
3245390	3246271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3267234	3271717	Oh, Bobby does point out it depends if you get the game from Japan or Hong Kong.
3271757	3272237	That's right.
3272277	3274278	There's a lot of game distributors in Hong Kong.
3274318	3275298	Thank you for reminding me.
3275798	3277899	And they make their game from Japan.
3277979	3279000	Then it goes to Hong Kong.
3279060	3279800	Then it comes here.
3280301	3282842	So yeah, and PlayAsia is stationed in Hong Kong.
3282902	3283622	Thank you for reminding me.
3283842	3284522	I forgot about that.
3285103	3287744	So yep, then you would have to pay the extra money.
3288404	3295508	Yeah, or do they still have those elaborate services where you can get something like shipped to a locker in Japan and then they'll ship what's in the locker to you?
3295528	3296128	Rakuten, I think.
3296368	3298008	Yeah, I thought that was a thing.
3298088	3298749	Like some of those.
3299029	3299429	Yeah.
3299669	3300689	There's still shopper sites.
3301269	3301509	Yeah.
3302209	3306570	Or maybe one of your close friends is planning on moving to Japan in a few months and can do all this shit for you.
3307150	3307710	We'll see.
3309291	3309591	All right.
3310151	3317653	Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time where the only tariff you had to pay was 25 cents per game.
3318553	3319893	Let's get to this segment.
3319913	3321373	That's not a tariff, Rob.
3321573	3324154	I know it's not, but forgive my transitions.
3334952	3342235	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
3342715	3345696	It's time for the classic game of the week.
3346296	3357080	And once a month for 2025, DarkSakura likes to pick a arcade or excuse me, a game that started as a video game but is now in the arcade.
3357400	3359101	So DarkSakura, what is... A console game.
3359281	3360622	Yeah, what is the... That goes to the arcade.
3360682	3364123	What is the console classic game to arcade of the month?
3365267	3365748	Tetris.
3366771	3369899	That's one I forgot went that path.
3369980	3371002	But yes, that's great.
3371022	3371303	Yeah.
3371363	3371764	Tell us more.
3373019	3377441	I mean, Tetris in its original conceptions was a PC game.
3377821	3387225	I mean, and of course there were all sorts of other variants, like even a version that you could play on a TI-83 graphic calculator, which I have.
3389186	3396589	But I mean, this is a game that has a Guinness World Record for the most ported game.
3397725	3398986	Video game of all time.
3400447	3401608	And I mean, yeah.
3402468	3418819	So we had had all kinds of home versions for different computers, including the Amstrad systems, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple II, BBC Micro Acorn, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, you know, IBM PCs, MS-DOS, Mac OS, PC 9800, X68000.
3418839	3420080	I mean, I could keep going.
3420100	3422241	We had a Famicom version.
3428105	3445536	of course we had but it wasn't you know we had all of these releases by the way that record was awarded in 2017 and the official versions are about 220 over 65 different platforms so yeah
3451048	3463976	So anyway, going back, I mean, we had the very original Spectrum Holobite version that was released January 27th, 1988.
3466838	3474220	So the first arcade version, there was one that came out, it was Sega's version, in December 1988.
3475480	3478081	And in Japan, it was the highest grossing game of 1989.
3480161	3483882	And it stayed in the highest grossing arcade conversion kits through 1995.
3486563	3498600	Um, this also led to, um, the, uh, there was a Mega Drive version being developed by, um, Sanri Tsudenki, and it was cancelled.
3499441	3502405	Um, they printed less than 10 copies.
3503146	3519474	but they actually did end up releasing a new version of it that came out on the Sega Genesis Mini so there's that and then of course there were other arcade versions that were released there was the Atari games version in 1988 as well and
3523456	3532321	Moving into later on, this just opened the door for us having all sorts of arcade versions.
3532401	3533922	Like in 1995, we had Tetris Plus.
3534042	3537705	We've had Tetris Plus 2 in 87.
3542751	3548254	Going further into Tetris the Grandmaster in 1998, 10 years after that original release.
3550495	3556578	There's a version... Oh my god, I kind of remember that there was a Sony Ericsson version in 1999.
3557018	3561000	But I mean, I'm just going through all the various arcade versions.
3561020	3563221	We had Tetris the Absolute, the Grandmaster 2 in 2000.
3563261	3563541	We had...
3568399	3569960	Oh yeah, there's the version I had on my phone.
3570000	3573242	I had the Sony Ericsson T68M.
3573462	3574723	Oh, I remember that phone.
3576044	3580727	We had 2005 Tetris the Grandmaster 3 Terror Instinct.
3581468	3587291	We had, I'm looking for another, the N-Gage version, Arcade Tetris Giant.
3587972	3588832	We've played that one.
3589132	3590673	Oh, that's the one that used to have a golf land.
3590714	3591374	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3591774	3592695	Yep, yep, yep, yep.
3594161	3600375	there was uh hold on I'm looking for another arcade one um
3602267	3610652	The video you have playing of the OG arcade Tetris, the Atari one, I'm watching this going, fuck, I missed this version of the game.
3610672	3613493	I literally want to fire up MAME and play this after the show.
3613854	3616615	Because I'm like, oh man, this version of Tetris was so good.
3616835	3619777	Just the way it was styled was just neat.
3620397	3620737	I don't know.
3621438	3627621	I get that it's all about Grandmaster and these newfangled Tetris now, but I have a special place in my heart for these oldies.
3628939	3658290	I'm laughing because there's an unofficial one called TERTIS T-E-R-T-I-S in 1991 for the Acorn Archimedes published by SICK just sick published by sick so yeah but back to it though I mean we have had a number of arcade releases and so it does count for home console games that have been ported to arcades
3658820	3660320	No, it absolutely counts.
3660360	3670963	You know, when I was originally reading you picking this pick, I was just like, yeah, like, you know, this game, I mean, technically it was originally, originally, like my brain goes, oh, it was originally a Game Boy game.
3670983	3671864	I was like, no, it wasn't.
3671904	3675645	It was originally, originally that Russian terminal system that didn't even exist here.
3675705	3676905	Like that's where the creator made it.
3677285	3679006	So yeah, I played Tetris forever.
3679186	3679526	I know that...
3680806	3681927	You know, I'm up on it now.
3682167	3684909	Hey, I watched that four-hour documentary, okay?
3684929	3685669	Don't try me.
3685949	3693114	But, you know, in all seriousness, like, you know, now it's, you know, you see the different divergent paths of Tetris, right?
3693214	3699678	And the versions that people consider to be, like, the biblical versions of Tetris, the definitive versions of Tetris.
3700058	3701679	And for some people, that's the Game Boy version.
3701719	3703160	For some people, that's the NES version.
3703480	3708883	Because, you know, when my people were crossing the desert, the only thing they had to stay amused with was Tetris.
3709144	3709304	Yeah.
3709944	3711325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3735542	3761003	and how that all works that kind of just makes the strategy in that game a little bit different and like it makes Tetris a very different experience between something like that which is rooted in the arcade and something like let's say Tetris Effect which is like obviously an extremely modern console version of Tetris that in in many ways is is definitive in and of itself so the fun thing going back into this is all of this started from woodblock puzzles
3761772	3763913	Yeah, yeah.
3763973	3766354	I love doing freaking woodblock puzzles for the record.
3766814	3776059	I know you did the long documentary, but Tetris Forever is really, really worth a playthrough or watch through, whatever you want to call it.
3776159	3781662	You see him working on a wood puzzle while he's talking about how the wood puzzles inspired Tetris.
3781782	3782382	It's really cool.
3782402	3782602	Oh, yeah.
3784693	3790077	I mean, I've got all kinds of apps that are just like, you know, the wood puzzle apps.
3790097	3792499	You have to fill the whole screen with the pieces that you have.
3793339	3795041	Those are so much fun to me.
3795181	3797863	And Tetris, you know, I used to do this when I was a kid.
3797903	3801846	And I think that that was really my first attraction to Tetris.
3802046	3805028	Also, this person is making mistakes in this video.
3806189	3807270	It's a long play video.
3807290	3807650	But anyway.
3808731	3809451	Choices were made.
3809491	3810392	Choices were made.
3810532	3811333	But this was a great choice.
3812403	3841095	but yeah, well thank you but no, I love me some Tetris and to this day maybe I'm not like I don't really enjoy the Grandmaster games that much but I enjoy the classic NES Tetris because once I get started I don't stop it's just like that I'm the same way with Dr. Mario if I have a gradual build up to it I just don't stop until I'm just bored
3842566	3846488	Yeah, and Rinmari in chat... Oh, go ahead.
3847988	3849389	Oh, no.
3849429	3855772	Rinmari in chat says, any Tetris game where a piece is instant lock, like the Nintendo and Atari versions, I can't really go back to, lol.
3855832	3856392	And I get that.
3856712	3862095	And it's even hard to play without the hold feature now that's present in modern Tetris games.
3862515	3863535	Y'all are spoiled.
3864236	3867697	I'm trying to think about what I would consider the definitive Tetris to be.
3868297	3871919	It would be the one that was on the Russian workstation.
3872559	3875401	Yeah, I mean, well, or to you, I guess, or whatever that is.
3875561	3879004	I think for me, I consider the Game Boy version the definitive edition.
3879144	3886109	But I completely understand that it's different for everybody and that the play styles are different.
3886389	3896937	But I will tell you what, if Tetris Plus on the PlayStation 1 by Jaleco is your definitive version of Tetris, something is wrong with you because that version sucked ass.
3898618	3899899	That's on God.
3899919	3900079	Yeah.
3902910	3909697	I would probably, I mean, well, to me, I would probably say just given that it was the Famicom one that I grew up with.
3910518	3915503	I mean, truly, you know, if I was going to be honest, I'd say the Game Boy version because I stole my mom's.
3916424	3923952	But I always was a big fan of like Blastress for a hot minute when we had our Super Scope.
3924852	3947467	but I'm gonna go on record right now saying that one of the emotional attachments I have in Tetris is fucking Tetranet oh fucking Tetranet core memory unlocked no T that's that's all of us on dial up on AO fucking L going hey you wanna play Tetranet yeah let's play Tetranet
3948832	3954576	And I don't know, maybe it was intended, but don't forget that Famicom and NES actually were different Tetrises.
3954876	3959299	The Famicom version was much different because it had to do – and Tetris Forever gets into this.
3959819	3963222	It's because – Remember I had my friend that had – Oh, yeah.
3963262	3964102	Okay, okay, okay.
3964543	3966444	So, yeah.
3966604	3976831	But a lot of people out there may not know without seeing the documentaries and stuff behind it that there really was a different version in Japan of Tetris than there was in the US.
3976871	3977771	I do have a cartridge.
3979652	3981993	And I have a Tetris 2 cartridge.
3982274	3986395	I don't even remember how to play Tetris 2.
3987556	3987936	I don't.
3988656	3991317	This is a Famicom cartridge.
3991457	3994459	I know people are going to say, no, you're wrong.
3994599	3994979	It's fine.
3994999	3995379	I don't care.
3995959	3997660	To me, Dr. Mario is Tetris 2.
3998841	4003022	And I think because it was the most logical feeling.
4003042	4003383	What's that?
4005239	4006359	I love freaking Dr. Mario.
4006459	4006979	I do too.
4007299	4009800	But that had nothing, that was nothing Tetris-y to me.
4009920	4018221	I know, but it was, well, for me, it was that same like look and feel of the pieces falling into the well, but it was like a different concept, you know?
4018421	4018742	I don't know.
4019502	4020822	I mean, but like, think about this.
4022122	4022942	Columns had that.
4023082	4024102	Puyo Puyo had that.
4024483	4025123	I hate Columns.
4025143	4026263	You know, all that preview.
4026503	4028463	I think Columns is a terrible game, I'm sorry.
4028483	4029443	But I'm throwing it out there.
4029503	4030084	I get it, I get it.
4030104	4031584	You know, Yoshi's Cookie.
4033038	4047636	Twinkle Star Sprites like all of those games that had Puzzle Fighter I do love Puzzle Fighter I do love Puzzle Fighter there's enough of a tweak in mechanics Puzzle Fighter is just P.O.P.O.
4047856	4051361	on incredible colorful crack I love P.O.P.O.
4051973	4057760	I was gonna say the other game that I can't stand in retrospect, and this game was everywhere.
4057860	4060923	People sure have sentimental attachments to it, but Klax.
4061364	4062305	That game was awful.
4062748	4063308	Hey, Klax.
4065529	4067229	I don't understand how you're supposed to be successful in that game.
4067249	4072471	I would play Klax when there was nothing else because it was always on free play at the roller rink.
4072551	4072851	Yeah.
4073391	4077272	Klax is one of those games where I'll play it once and I'll be like, this game is fucking terrible.
4077292	4078452	How are you supposed to get good at this game?
4078472	4079493	And then I'd never play it again.
4079533	4082354	Klax is the game that you play to remind yourself of how bad Klax is.
4082394	4084034	Yes, yes, that part.
4085815	4086155	Yeah.
4086895	4087155	Anyway.
4088680	4090360	But there were a lot of bad Tetris.
4090440	4098562	I mean, and... And also, if you use the Type-C music on NES Tetris, there's a special place in hell for you.
4098742	4106924	I think just, like, maybe why I feel the way I do about Dr. Mario is that all of, like, the official Tetris sequels are just, like, non-starters to me.
4107204	4113165	Like, I'm sorry, and I know people are going to disagree, and that's fine, but to me, Tetris 2, didn't care for it.
4113525	4114745	Hat-triss, bad.
4115005	4116206	Face-triss, bad.
4116526	4117146	Word-triss...
4118712	4120112	Interesting, but not great.
4120793	4124034	But Blastress was, though, just kind of fun, I have to say.
4124154	4125154	God, what was the other one?
4125914	4128735	Hatress, Facetress, they were just all bad.
4129055	4129876	None of them were good.
4131736	4132836	But, anyway.
4133757	4138658	We kind of liked, we liked the Bombtress, though, that was pretty fun.
4138818	4140099	Questbuster says, where am I faced?
4140119	4141859	Did you ever play Tetris Battle Gaiden?
4141879	4143260	Probably.
4143340	4143960	Probably.
4145720	4146500	That's a fun one.
4146661	4148643	I think that's in Tetris Forever.
4149204	4151627	Questmaster says, where are my face-tress people at?
4152208	4154570	Out back by the dumpster trying to find your game.
4160236	4165141	Bonds 006 says, does anyone else see Tetris falling in their sleep?
4165281	4166201	No, I guess it's just me.
4166562	4167403	That was the whole thing.
4167703	4169685	You remember that original Tetris Effect trailer?
4170345	4174929	Go back and watch the Tetris Effect trailer.
4175210	4177091	It was really one of the best trailers they ever did.
4177832	4180955	S200 Matt says, we're drawing lines in the sand tonight on OLR.
4180995	4181596	We sure are.
4181796	4182296	We sure are.
4183677	4183938	All right.
4185003	4186345	Anyway, let's move on.
4186745	4189869	Let's talk about a couple other quick items in rapid fire news.
4190630	4192032	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4193953	4194513	Do I gotta?
4194614	4195154	Okay, I gotta.
4196494	4202797	So the ACNEO Geo Selection Volume 5 and 6 has been announced for Switch.
4203337	4215603	We'll be dealing for Volume 5, Era Fighters 2, Aggressors of Dark Combat, Art of Fighting 2, Burning Fights, Cyber Lip, King of Fighters 2002, Real Bout, Fatal Fury, Super Sidekicks, Thrash Rally, Twinkle Star Sprites.
4215863	4217564	Fucking love Twinkle Star Sprites.
4218744	4224386	and then for volume 6, Era Fighters 3, Football Frenzy, King of Fighters 98, which is so good.
4224786	4226366	Last Blade 2, yes!
4227427	4228187	Okay, excuse me.
4228787	4238450	Overtop, Real Bout, Fatal Fury Special, Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's Revenge, Sengoku 3, The Ultimate 11, SNK Football Championship, Zed Blade.
4238750	4241510	I want them both, because both have things I want.
4243071	4246592	Although, I mean, if I really wanted to play Last Blade 2, I could just bust out my Dreamcast.
4247634	4271888	I was going to say bust out my Neo Geo and my fat fucking cartridge okay given that I have a Neo Geo and a bunch of fat fucking cartridges I do not have Last Blade 2 and I would give somebody else's right arm for it maybe their left arm too and a couple of their metatarsals what's your foot bones?
4273752	4274072	All right.
4274212	4281358	Yeah, those sound like really impressive collections because I have not... Yeah, I don't know why this is ACA, but... Oh, Arcade Archives.
4281378	4281739	I guessed.
4282359	4283040	Oh, Arcade Archives.
4283080	4283420	Thank you.
4283440	4284221	Because I was like, what?
4284541	4286262	The Affordable Care Act making video games?
4286302	4287723	No, it's Arcade Archives.
4288733	4315131	um but yeah well and you can get those piecemeal I'm pretty sure today but I have to admit I don't follow the arcade archive series week to week so it's only when these big massive collections come out that I go oh oh shit I need to get in on that they release some good shit on that platform I keep forgetting like the original Tetris Grandmaster came out on arcade archives at some point so it's like something I kind of want to go revisit now that I've been playing four I do play four on my steam deck I really enjoy it so
4316229	4316909	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4342179	4344280	If you delude yourself long enough, you eventually believe it.
4345360	4350401	So a small development, I guess, in this particular story that happened.
4350941	4354642	The translator response in full is the following.
4355763	4357363	Yes, I want to do something.
4357503	4360764	Currently, Dragon Quest has seen three, one, and two remakes.
4361064	4361825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4377825	4380987	Yuji Horii sees you and wishes you'd stop calling.
4381047	4381507	No, I'm kidding.
4381567	4385029	But, you know, it's a possibility for sure, but we'll see.
4385309	4395735	We're going to find out a little later how you all feel about remakes with not our Fugle Question of the Week, but kind of a newer thing we're doing during the Listener Roundtable.
4396235	4402839	But first, we need to travel around and check out some release dates of some games coming out real soon.
4403699	4404460	Let's start in Japan.

4452483	4453885	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
4454966	4456467	It is not a busy week, okay?

4530529	4532311	That is out on Windows, Switch,
4532671	4538519	PS4 and Xbox One, but we know that means they also play on the Xbox Series and PlayStation 5.

4551175	4567213	Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper Capcom vs SNK 2 which honestly that's the only fucking game I need that is the only fucking game I need but I'll take everything else and then Capcom Fighting Evolution is also in there so
4568734	4571435	That's a stacked fucking collection, let me tell you.
4572276	4574977	I'm still tempted to wait until it goes on sale, but we'll see.
4575557	4579059	I know my friend will pick it up right away, and I'm like, I can go play it at his house, but we'll see.
4579959	4584061	Anyway, that's the release dates from around the world.
4585101	4588523	Some folks in chat, Mike Def says, I'm getting that collection on launch for Switch.
4589063	4591124	Yeah, I don't blame y'all.
4592044	4593905	Def says, may pick it up for Steam too.
4593925	4595006	Ooh, the double dipping!
4595848	4601630	The Double Dippy, remember when y'all made fun of me for like quadruple dipping on Mass Effect 3?
4603011	4603451	What was that?
4604831	4612134	PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Wii U. I had the fucking Wii U version of Mass Effect 3.
4612534	4614135	I'm the one that bought it on sale.
4614455	4616096	But I modded mine to shit and back.
4619137	4621798	Yeah, I remember your old, whatever happened to your old Tumblr?
4623533	4623993	It's still there.
4624193	4626194	MassAffecting.tumblr.com Yeah.
4627055	4629156	I heard Tumblr was like in a renaissance thing right now.
4630696	4633457	I was actually thinking about revi- what, what, what?
4634978	4635979	Oh, because I misspelled it.
4636819	4640120	Fucking A. MassAffecting.
4640761	4641321	There we go.
4641501	4643762	Fucking A. I was about to freak the fuck out.
4644322	4645043	Alright, yeah.
4646583	4646944	It's there.
4649104	4650985	Last post set October 30th, 2023.
4653314	4654214	And it was about Silent Hill.
4654815	4655295	It was.
4655535	4655855	It was.
4655895	4658136	But you had an N7 post in 2019.
4658936	4659896	So, good times.
4659916	4660116	Yeah.
4660817	4663718	I mean, I still have like over 10,000 followers on it for some reason.
4663958	4664438	That's cool.
4665978	4666218	All right.
4666258	4666438	Yeah.
4666879	4668299	I mean, maybe it's time to bring it back.
4668379	4668719	Who knows?
4668899	4671900	Well, let's go to a place where we don't have 10,000 followers.
4671980	4673741	We have 160 about.
4673781	4674781	Which, hey, I'll take it.
4674841	4675241	I'll take it.
4675321	4682684	It's our Blue Sky over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com because we are verified by... We need to play like a MIDI version of Mr. Blue Sky for this segment.
4683584	4687565	I know, right?
4687886	4693227	We're verified by domain over on Blue Sky, so you can follow us at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4694268	4701770	We asked a fun question this week that I want to get to, which is, for tonight's show, what's your take on video game remakes?
4703050	4704331	There's been a lot of hullabaloo.
4705071	4706432	I love that I was able to use that name today.
4707232	4711415	Around a potential Chrono Trigger remake, as I talked about during Rapid Fire News.
4711715	4715037	Would you want to see this or a classic that you love remade at all?
4715397	4718119	Or are these classics best remembered as only a classic?
4718139	4720180	You know, people definitely feel this way about a lot of movies.
4721441	4723422	So I was curious what you all think about games.
4723442	4727445	Do you like to see these remakes or do you get a little irritated when you hear about this stuff?
4727785	4728926	So let's go through some of the answers.
4730690	4744925	13X Forever messaged us on Blue Sky hello hello and said remakes are a great way to make old title more accessible to current audiences visuals controls gameplay accessibility societal norms everything is changing and not everything ages equally well
4745586	4749370	However, Chrono Trigger had so many remakes, and the latest one is still fresh.
4749470	4756397	I'm assuming referring to the relatively recent iPad, and I'm sure it was on Android as well, so mobile version, we'll say.
4757559	4761082	He says, give me Final Fantasy Tactics or A or A2.
4761242	4761583	Mm-hmm.
4763457	4765258	DarkTetsuya says, personally, I'm all for it.
4765938	4778705	Considering your options these days are either the Steam release or track down one of the previous releases of the game, which could get expensive, at least as far as OG Super Nintendo goes, I would certainly not object to a new HD 2D release on modern systems.
4779106	4780706	It worked out for Dragon Quest 3.
4781307	4784849	I'm looking forward to Dragon Quest 1 and 2, which I thought would have been out by now, to be honest.
4785149	4785269	Hmm.
4786010	4789793	Anyway, SSJ100Matt messaged us, oh, I'm sorry, I skipped one.
4789833	4795498	DungeonBuster messaged us saying, one way I like looking at a solid remake is that they're kind of like reposts.
4795899	4801744	They share that experience with those that might have missed out with a bit of added polish after learning something new since then.
4802304	4803685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4825489	4827570	They weren't that great, so something to think about.
4827670	4837256	Anyway, S200Matt says, I think remakes are a great way for folks of this generation of gamers to experience the classics as well as us older folk get to revisit.
4837816	4845881	A Chrono Trigger remake done in the style of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake would be at the top of my list, but how about a Blades of Steel remake?
4846981	4848182	Why do you need Konami originals?
4851518	4879344	I loved Blades of Steel Blades of Steel and only if it has the mini version of Gradius available still at halftime or whatever they call the third breaks in hockey Critical Myth says sometimes remakes are a great opportunity to play something you missed on old hardware that is no longer easy to find or use I recently played Dragon Quest 3 Remake and I don't think I would have been able to play the game otherwise
4880179	4885310	I guess it's, you know, maybe the old school NES graphics can be a little grating at some point, so...
4887183	4894887	Redertainment replied and said, I'm all for gaming companies going through their catalogs of IPs and seeing what hasn't been used in a while.
4895287	4898328	Perhaps they could look at something that flopped and see how they could do much better.
4899028	4900829	Much like with Battlestar Galactica.
4901410	4902050	Interesting.
4902590	4909873	Maybe not necessarily remaking because, you know, I think a lot of this are approaching this with remaking like a legendary game or a game a lot of people remember fondly.
4910474	4915256	But Redertainment is suggesting what about going back and redoing a game that sucked?
4916056	4917717	and giving it the attention it deserves.
4918658	4919758	Interesting proposition.
4919818	4920279	I like that.
4922700	4930945	Fifth Dream Today says, I still fantasize, no pun intended, about getting a Final Fantasy VI remake like the one VII has been getting.
4931505	4939590	Remakes with small changes and visual updates are fun, but huge overhauls that really honor the original are great, and the original is still there to enjoy.
4940031	4940291	You know...
4941954	4942795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4965089	4970330	because that's really like the story completely retold from the ground up.
4970390	4976391	It's like it's told for the stage instead of told for the screen or the novel instead of the original.
4976411	4978731	But it's just – it's so different to me.
4979191	4988673	So it's weird when I – and it's not to shade the original comment because I completely understand why your brain is going there because they called that game Final Fantasy VII Remake.
4988993	4994334	So we're all kind of conditioned to think, oh, when they remake a Final Fantasy game, it needs to be that in-depth.
4994674	5014331	and I don't necessarily think that's what we're asking for a lot of these re-releases I don't know about you all that's not what I need for Chrono Trigger I would actually be worried that's how you get the bad remakes that was referenced in an earlier post is by changing the things that people really loved I don't know that's my opinion
5016609	5017230	Let's go to Mish.
5018170	5026055	Mishkins, who says, I wouldn't mind a remake, but I feel like at this point it'll run us $100 if it did happen.
5026596	5029137	Ooh, little tongue-in-cheek, but you're not incorrect.
5029177	5029938	You're not incorrect.
5030918	5035842	Bryguy replies to us on Blue Sky saying, I'd like to see a Star Fox Adventure remake.
5036182	5037583	Need more Tricky in my life.
5038383	5040927	I think we just need Star Fox to make a comeback.
5041047	5041528	I think we do.
5041608	5045053	Let's all cross our fingers and toes and find our favorite effigy.
5045073	5046455	But do a barrel roll.
5046615	5048177	Yeah, let's all do a barrel roll.
5048237	5048558	You're right.
5048878	5050981	Do a barrel roll to get Star Fox on Switch 2.
5051021	5051102	Um...
5053744	5053964	Ms.
5054004	5058887	Coral Rose on Blue Sky responds to us saying, Game budgets are unsustainable.
5059167	5061568	The financial risk is killing companies and jobs.
5062028	5064409	Remaking older games is a good middle ground.
5064710	5071113	They're smaller, they're known quantities, and they can revive a franchise or get a niche game the audience it deserves.
5071853	5074374	For me, Vagrant Story and the Xena Saga games.
5074875	5081218	Also a really realistic take on, and this is the case for Hollywood as well,
5083087	5087270	A lot of people bitch about the remakes and the retellings and why do we have to do these shows again?
5087710	5090772	Because it's been shown that people will tend to watch them.
5091897	5094297	I do feel like some of the damn is starting to break on that.
5094357	5097238	Like not every revival has been doing fantastically.
5098118	5102519	Like the Night Court remake just got canceled after three seasons, but it still lasted three seasons.
5103079	5105159	And even I went, it was on more than one.
5105400	5106180	That's surprising.
5106540	5112061	And in games, I think that's, you know, we talk about $80 from this giant team to do this.
5112361	5112821	You're right.
5112921	5118482	A remake is something much smaller in scope that they can probably put out at a more affordable price.
5120765	5121405	Something to think about.
5121425	5125268	I think remakes are unavoidable for those reasons, as Coral points out.
5126769	5130812	Fuzzerhop on Blue Sky says, I think it all depends on how playable the game is.
5131252	5136255	Some games might just need a graphical update, or others just need bug fixes or a faster sale.
5136836	5140858	It's really hard to determine which games need more fixing and which games don't.
5141279	5143100	It's all a matter of opinion, really.
5144101	5147403	I'm reading Fuzzerhop's reply going, if they did an E.T.
5147463	5147843	Atari 2600 remake...
5151594	5165412	the instruction manual would be built in this time so you would know how to play the game besides just playing it up on a ROM going this is terrible you would know that what was it game 4 was actually the beginner mode of the game that helps you get used to the mechanics and all that other stuff
5166033	5167255	DarkDetsuya said,
5185356	5193681	On the President Cat Talk, I saw a YouTuber I watch regularly find a copy of the game in one of those retro game shops over in Japan.
5194141	5195582	They were asking 65,780 yen.
5195622	5196483	That's about $450.
5196523	5197984	So I guess it became quite the collector's item.
5198044	5198344	You're welcome.
5212059	5213119	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5239808	5243891	I don't think it would be worth $450 open, but he could probably still get a pretty penny for it.
5246253	5246773	Give it to me.
5248134	5249035	That is so wild.
5249695	5251056	Here's my question, Dr. Zia.
5251557	5253958	Did the YouTuber call it President Cat?
5255619	5258301	No, it has nothing to do with being an actual president.
5258381	5259782	It's like a company president.
5259842	5265847	No, I know, but that's the tell on if it was something they got from us or if they actually translated the real name.
5265867	5266287	They got it from us.
5266547	5268088	Yeah, if they call it President Cat.
5268729	5268969	Anyway.
5269830	5270770	Oh, Dr. Cia says no.
5270790	5271431	That came from us.
5271791	5272011	Yeah.
5274232	5274552	All right.
5275132	5275452	Anyway.
5275953	5278293	You were the ones who called that game President Cat to start.
5278394	5282735	Yes, because you were talking about that loose translation.
5282775	5284376	And I think I said, done.
5284756	5285476	We don't need a reason.
5285516	5286237	President Cat.
5286257	5287317	That's a great fucking idea.
5287357	5288037	You're the president.
5288057	5289218	You're the president of the company.
5289938	5290839	What a great name that is.
5290859	5292479	And we just fucking ran with it.
5292519	5293480	I was saying it's like...
5294875	5298417	The Leader or President and it's a delinquent girl, you know.
5298697	5301758	And it doesn't, CEO Cat doesn't have the same ring to it, you know.
5303199	5303459	Yeah.
5305040	5307501	It's more, I can buy and sell this company.
5308482	5308702	Yeah.
5309662	5315045	Alright, anyway, DarkSakura, I don't think we had anything in the mailbox, but I'll check rather than assume.
5315185	5315365	Okay.
5316265	5318246	Then you can always send us emails.
5318406	5321948	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send an email.
5322809	5323149	Love that.
5324764	5325585	Otherwise, that's it.
5325725	5330987	I know I don't have any last-minute stories, and I doubt you do either, DarkSakura, so this is it.
5331007	5332088	I'm not doing Dead by Daylight.
5332108	5332588	Final thoughts.
5332708	5333228	I blame you.
5333589	5334369	What are you playing tonight?
5335369	5336310	I'm going to play Claire Obscure.
5337831	5340372	Ooh, okay, okay.
5340792	5341453	I'll get it started.
5341913	5344674	I can't play for very long because, you know, tomorrow's a work day.
5344954	5354438	Okay, but we can see the beginning of the game, which I think a lot of people who haven't seen the beginning of the game on Twitch, and maybe if they don't have the money to pick up the game or whatever, this is great.
5354558	5356778	So I think there's a lot of reason for people to stay tuned tonight.
5357479	5357919	My channel.
5360922	5361543	It's my house!
5363604	5370390	Anyway, DarkSakura, before we let you go, let me say, of course, as always, thank you, of course, for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and listening to us.
5370430	5373452	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
5373852	5380758	So please leave us a nice five-star review, a place like iTunes, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube.
5381098	5382359	It goes an awful long way.
5382459	5387563	So thank you, of course, for telling a friend about the show because we need more voices to put out on air.
5388523	5390085	We'll see you next week in seven days.
5390185	5391325	We won't see DarkSakura.
5391366	5392987	You'll be at Golden State Pinball Festival.
5393487	5394168	But have fun.
5394248	5394568	I will.
5394808	5396309	I'm going to try to go on Saturday.
5396349	5400132	So if we have any locals that make the trek out to Lodi, I'm going to try to go on Saturday.
5401373	5402654	So maybe I'll see you there too.
5402674	5403534	But DarkSakura will be there.
5403574	5404735	But Loki will be back next week.
5405296	5406997	And we're going to have the RV.
5407857	5408378	That'll be fun.
5409292	5414216	There's going to be there's going to be adventures in culinary delights that involve fire.
5414416	5416078	Is there air conditioning in that RV?
5417158	5418139	I'm sure there has to be.
5418159	5418720	I mean, I don't know.
5418760	5419240	It's not ours.
5419280	5419700	That's all.
5419740	5420621	That's all you need.
5421202	5423543	DJ Ranma S is inside the building.
5424264	5427687	DJ Ranma S is teasing in a call from Japan next Sunday.
5427747	5430729	Oh, that might be fun because I think what this shows on like Monday morning.
5430989	5433531	We used to have a live listener that would like listen to us at work.
5434452	5435693	I haven't seen his name in a while.
5435733	5436494	I hope he's doing well.
5436554	5438455	But you'll be like 8 or 9 a.m.
5438515	5439516	over there while the show's on.
5439616	5441057	So it's always kind of fun.
5441498	5443779	So yeah, by all means, if you want to call in, that would be great.
5443799	5446702	It'd be a good way to do it because it's just Loki and I here next week.
5447762	5449604	Because I'll be here back by Sunday night.
5450304	5453727	I like pinball, but not to the extent that Dan and Jamie do.
5453827	5455228	So they'll be there the whole time.
5455308	5456569	I'm fine going for one day.
5456689	5458351	Well, I'm going to say if you are...
5459469	5462091	at the show or have the ability to make it there.
5462611	5469476	We are bringing a prototype of Multimorphic's newest table, Portal.
5470637	5471217	That's exciting.
5471297	5472778	It's been sitting in my garage.
5473419	5474079	It's fun.
5475180	5475981	It's really fun.
5476081	5476861	I want to come play it.
5477862	5478542	I need to.
5478562	5479003	Come over.
5479223	5479523	Shit.
5480524	5480864	All right.
5482349	5487291	Alright, I will let you go so you can get your stream started and then I'll wrap it up here all by myself.
5487351	5492233	I will wait on purpose to start the game when people are there, okay?
5492573	5492853	Alright.
5492873	5493313	Okay.
5493994	5494874	Alright, have a good stream.
5494914	5496035	Have a good stream, Jamie.
5496355	5497575	Bye.
5497835	5499316	And that leaves me all by myself.
5500016	5502477	All by myself.
5502937	5504918	Alright, I guess I'll put myself front and center then.
5505318	5505939	Hi, everybody.
5506299	5507059	It's just me.
5507679	5508940	Everybody else left me.
5510834	5511735	Thank you, Mike Deft.
5511755	5512956	Yes, I am dancing on my own.
5513036	5514257	You're right.
5514297	5517020	Like the good Robin said, I'm dancing on my own.
5532014	5533355	I hope you all have a wonderful week.
5533435	5534095	Happy gaming.
5534235	5535876	I know I'm going to be playing more games this week.
5536216	5539837	Yes, I'm going to play more Diablo 4 and no, you can't do anything about it.
5540557	5541218	Take care of each other.
5541278	5541978	Have a great month.
5543078	5543698	Go outside.
5544039	5545039	Go outside and take a walk.
5545639	5551281	Go on a stupid walk for your stupid mental health and you can play like Pokemon or Pikmin or Ingress or whatever tickles your fancy when you go walk.
5551802	5552342	Have fun, everybody.
5552362	5552842	Have a great week.
5552922	5553322	Bye, everybody.
5556023	5558304	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5560615	5561276	See you next week.
