9673	11975	I don't work at Rockstar, I don't know the answer, but I do know what happened.
33849	39623	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you the new release date you might already know and the rest of the week's gaming news.
39903	42068	Starting right now on the show, wherever a gamer has a voice.
44577	46858	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
46898	50098	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
50238	62461	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live once again tonight with episode number 1045 of our program for today, May the 4th, 2025.
62601	65882	Yes, yes, may the 4th be with you, yada, yada, et cetera, et cetera.
66122	69303	So I have Star Trek to talk about tonight, so y'all are just going to have to deal.
69663	70964	But we'll get into that later.
71324	72284	Maybe they want to...
72964	74365	Maybe they want to talk about Star Wars.
74405	76167	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
77307	77828	Hiss.
78649	78809	What?
78829	79749	You're not a Trek fan?
80010	80290	Hiss.
80490	80970	Hiss back.
81010	83372	I didn't say I wasn't.
83492	86795	It's like the, oh, you like pancakes, so you must not like waffles.
88276	89317	No, you can like both.
89397	90538	It doesn't have to be either or.
90658	91258	You can like both.
91739	92219	You can like both.
92299	94741	I like Trek a little more, but I appreciate both.
95081	96823	So, yeah, it's fine.
97063	99365	To be honest, it doesn't matter to me what other people like.
99385	100305	It only matters what I like.
102494	102974	How are you doing?
104695	105155	Snarky.
106375	107136	I couldn't tell.
109456	110497	I'm in a mood, okay?
110557	111277	I'm in a mood.
111497	114118	Do we ever have any other Jamie here on this program?
115418	115798	What?
115998	117219	No, no, I'm in a super mood.
118579	121860	Not like a super mood, but a super mood.
121960	123441	Not the super snark-tendo.
125321	126001	I am.
126662	127802	I've just had a day of it.
127862	131083	I am in the point where I am sick of shit.
131417	132639	Are we at the detox meme?
132699	133800	I've had it officially.
134441	134842	Are we there?
136484	138447	I spread La Mer on my toast, I'm sure, bitch.
139989	140289	All right.
140690	142031	Well, let's see what kind of mood he's in.
142071	143393	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
143473	144074	How are you doing, Loki?
144901	145842	Is tired a mood?
146362	147143	Absolutely.
147283	148324	That's where I am right now.
148484	149785	Absolutely tired is a mood.
149845	150545	I've been tired.
150625	151626	I will settle with tired.
151926	152987	Yeah, it works.
153848	155809	Loving the Mario Kart playing behind you tonight.
155970	156790	Which Mario Kart is that?
156830	158091	It's modded Mario Kart.
158291	158552	Is it?
158612	159412	I was like, which one is that?
159432	160373	Is that the Wii one?
160393	161113	But it looks better.
161254	162975	What is what is Mario Kart?
163035	167679	We Mario Kart Wii Deluxe with like several hundred tracks.
168419	169740	Wow, several hundred tracks.
170140	171481	Amazing what those modders do.
172261	176483	I'm just giggling because the name's very funny, but that's really impressive.
177103	180745	Good job, modders, even though that's certainly a legal gray area.
180785	184227	But come on, all of those people are going to buy Mario Kart World 80 bucks or not.
184407	187848	All those people, it's just pouring into the Mario Kart fandom, right?
189049	189289	Yeah.
190009	192370	I got to play Mario Kart less than 24 hours ago.
193631	194892	I was at Super Nintendo World.
195973	199357	So yeah, very, very last minute decision.
200157	205763	Within the last like four weeks, I decided I was going to go see Kylie Minow a second time.
206484	207925	And Alan was in on the plan.
207985	216294	We were like, you know what, we're going to go see our Star Trek cruise friend, Sean, who is out here from the Midwest, who was going to go see the Kylie show in LA.
216714	217775	And we were like, you know what?
218436	222058	We were able to get tickets, and they weren't overpriced.
222539	223379	They were reasonable.
223539	224460	We were like, you know what?
224500	225841	Let's just fucking go.
225881	226641	Let's go on a road trip.
226661	227982	Let's go see Kylie a second time.
228362	237128	I don't usually follow a lot of concerts to see them multiple times, but for Kylie, who I've actually never seen live before this, but have liked for a long time, it was worth it.
237208	240710	But we made a very last-minute decision within the last week.
241111	245754	So when we were doing the last OLR, I did not know I would be talking about Super Nintendo World tonight.
246094	247535	But within the last week, we decided...
247955	263045	You know, as long as we're in L.A., Universal's got this thing going on right now called Fan Nights, which is kind of, in a way, it's their answer to Disney and all the special nights that they do, but also Universal's had the Horror Nights for some time.
263445	268808	So I think this is them trying to find ways to do that at different times of the year to try to bring in those nighttime dollars.
269869	271790	So we were able to go to the park at 7 p.m.,
273711	275052	We stayed until about midnight.
275252	278273	Technically, they were open until 2 a.m., but I can't imagine going that late.
278733	281354	Not everything was open past 10 p.m.
281394	282014	or 11 p.m.
282074	283774	Some rides closed early.
284815	288856	We had to do the Mario Kart ride before I think 10.30 was when it closed.
289236	290576	We were able to go on Nintendo World.
290616	291357	We were able to do it.
292637	293818	and it was fine.
293978	296539	It's a really neat sort of experience.
296579	298560	The ride queue is very impressive.
299081	302503	Everything in Nintendo World is just really impressive to behold.
302983	307005	The ride itself though, I just didn't love the creative direction they went with it.
307105	307866	I'm gonna be honest.
308246	311407	I did not like the whole VR, like it wasn't even VR.
311807	319008	It was like you put this headset on with goggles, but when I say goggles, I mean like a plastic visor that hangs over your head.
319048	322709	And I'm assuming the visor is actually some sort of projector with the image.
322749	325369	I'm assuming that's somehow how the magic works, that sort of thing.
325389	334631	Because as you look around, you see Mario Carters going all around you and you can actually look down at your wheel and you see how many coins and shells that you have.
335291	353264	and so the game is that you're supposed to hit the Bowser and the Koopa kids with golden shells and you're supposed to not hit Mario and Princess and all the Mario team people and when it says turn left and right you're supposed to follow that and that's how you get coins and you're supposed to get like so much I
353644	354225	I don't like to give...
375026	375766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
390914	418286	so like you know they got some really interesting concepts I just didn't like again I found the hologram thing to be very distracting because it was all nonsensical it didn't really line up with the black light ride that you were going through and I felt like my visor was off because you aim by looking which is the worst aiming system ever because if the thing is slightly off then the shell is just going to go wherever it wants and so it wasn't like you know
419746	427088	10, 20 year ago VR tech that they're implementing there, you know, Oculus DK2 type tech.
427128	427348	Yeah.
427848	431849	So the interesting thing was there were three of us in the car.
431909	435650	So there's actually five of us at the park, but they put three of us in one car and two of us in the other.
435990	437751	And so they put a single rider next to us.
438171	440693	Well, the single rider we got was Big Gamer.
441074	442215	He was Big Gamer.
442315	443676	He rode this ride all the time.
443716	447579	It was like trying to tell us what to aim for and stuff and where to get the big points.
448120	456867	And I was like, I don't expect that this person knows who I am, nor do I expect that having a 23-year-old podcast necessarily makes me the world best gamer.
457228	461732	But it did take a little something out of like, I just want to experience this, bro.
461872	462552	I would have told him.
463153	464254	Honestly, I would have just told him.
464795	468644	I probably should have, but, you know, it's just one of those things.
468664	469225	I don't care.
469505	469826	I know.
469967	470187	I know.
470207	470708	I'm in a mood.
470929	471690	Remember, I'm in a mood.
473066	474126	I'm just going to be honest.
474306	477527	I thought Toy Story's Midway Mania was a more fun game.
478887	484109	I do still think the Mario Kart ride, if you're a Nintendo fan, is worth doing once in your life.
484489	488790	I think it's really impressive and just the queue is incredible and everything is great.
489690	494771	But I don't think it, for me, has the same replayability that Midway Mania has.
495391	499232	Quite honestly, I would want to ride the ride once and just ignore the game.
500109	501910	I think that's what I'm going to do next time.
502210	527226	That's what's annoying about it is that they have like VR I don't remember which park has it or maybe it's an attraction or something in Japan but they have VR versions of Mario Kart that are full VR that you just sit in like a little, basically sit in a racing chair and you play the game and that looks like a lot more fun than that ride so it's just weird to see them outdone
528268	529249	years prior.
530350	540758	Going to our chat room over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
541719	544901	And Fifth Dream in chat says, sounds like a hygiene issue.
545281	547763	Like I wouldn't want to wear something hundreds of people already have.
548244	550806	So they do the same collection of the goggles thing.
550826	551126	It's paralyzed.
551266	552247	Yeah, the Disney does.
552668	554630	I think they steam sterilize it or something.
554710	559456	I don't know what the system is, but it's a similar collection to what they do at Midway Mania.
559756	561759	Why wouldn't you think you'd sterilize it though?
562965	567749	I guess maybe if you don't realize that, yes, they collect the visors and put them in the thing.
567909	569410	It's a thing.
570351	573933	As far as I'm aware, that's actually an operational requirement for rides like that.
574013	575014	I'm sure it has to be.
575154	580338	I don't know what the magic is, but it's whatever Disney's doing, they're doing in that regard.
582299	582719	Let's see.
583819	587440	QuestBuster says, the Mario Kart ride sounds like a cool concept to try out at least once.
587860	590661	It is, and I'm not going to sit here and lie and say, oh, it was bad.
591041	592121	No, it was really neat.
592301	596622	I just didn't care for the game thrown into the Blacklight ride.
596682	599122	I kind of just wish they'd lean into one lane or the other.
599463	601163	But I'm not going to sit here and say it sucked.
601303	602283	It is really cool.
602343	603763	You should do it once in your life.
604344	610185	And that's kind of how I feel about Nintendo World as well, is that for me, Nintendo World was just...
611325	612566	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
632577	632657	No.
632677	632717	No.
656443	656984	and DarkSakura.com.
676504	678406	and there was all sorts of things you could get.
678426	681708	They had salads and healthier choices too, if that's what you really wanted.
682049	687313	Or if you wanted really unhealthy shit, they had full-on shakes that were green and themed.
688154	690556	I thought it was cute, but apparently it's extremely popular.
690856	694520	We had to get a reservation at 10.15 at night to go there.
695100	695360	So...
696121	703444	I ate very late last night, but as far as theme park dining goes, it's hard to touch Disney.
703564	707585	It's no Carthay Circle, but it was nice.
708185	711286	For that kind of food, I'm, dare I say, reasonably priced.
712447	717789	Alan took a screen cap and put it on his blue sky, and one of our friends replied, Mama, that's just Seattle prices.
719169	720590	I thought that was funny.
722470	723631	I was expecting worse.
725133	725653	But it was fine.
726073	727134	So yeah, that was cool.
727474	731395	So we did some other standard Universal things, but they do have some other special things.
731695	737677	So can I quickly just mention, and Jamie will love this because I'm going to bring up Star Trek, but it might surprise you.
738077	748501	So one of the other limited things they have there is Star Trek Red Alert, where they actually have set pieces from the Enterprise D that they used in Star Trek Picard that they have on display.
748841	751902	But instead of just having them on display where you can walk in and see them, they
752202	760824	They do this whole like experience type thing, like think the Star Trek Vegas ride, but way worse because it's temporary.
761744	774788	The actors are doing their best with kind of a subpar script that is a plot to move you from room to room to see things where, of course, the final room is the actual bridge that you can see that stuff.
774888	775068	But
776208	777149	I'm just going to be real.
777289	779830	As a Star Trek fan, I found it kind of bad.
780071	780851	I didn't care for it.
781251	783032	I really just wish it was an open museum.
783072	785093	We could have just gone in and seen the set pieces.
786034	788275	I can't just be the Star Trek experience.
788415	789356	Exactly.
789416	793999	The actors were very much just wearing cosplay costumes from Bot Online.
795439	797941	The script was mediocre at best.
798961	802443	And I really think some of them were probably having to read off teleprompters.
802463	803324	Yeah.
803724	806905	Although I will say there was a half Klingon and she looked fierce.
807385	808165	She looked amazing.
808685	809825	Some of the makeup was really good.
810865	812546	So I'll give it that.
812686	826288	But I kind of... When you're in the bridge room and they're acting out the final season, if you look up, there's a giant hole in the ceiling where you can see the entire studio rig of the studio that they borrowed to do this limited edition thing.
826648	828489	And it really takes you out of the experience.
828529	829289	So it's just...
830650	834796	I think it was just, like, it's only a three-week event they're doing, this FanFest thing.
835176	837820	And so I think that's why, like, it just, it felt temporary.
838100	839061	That's the problem with it.
839162	840163	It felt temporary.
840904	842085	You should leave feedback on it.
842867	843487	Funny enough...
844540	844660	Good.
844720	844920	Good.
863027	864568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
879252	880692	Disney Disney Disney Disney
902598	931637	I would love to see them put a sense of permanency with Star Trek I don't know how that works because Star Trek is Paramount but Paramount is no longer in the theme park business as those of us that live in Northern California know because of what happened with Great America and now the fact that the Knott's people own it and every time I tell people did you know there's a Mass Effect ride at Great America people go either one of two things one what I didn't know there was a Mass Effect ride or two or two that's still there
933072	934094	I still need to see that.
934395	935136	I never got to go.
935577	935777	Yeah.
937120	938562	We should go on a theme park day.
938763	939404	That would be fun.
939564	940005	I'd love to go.
940908	941428	I'd go again.
942309	945570	I will say there was one other experience I'll mention quickly, and this is adjacent to gaming.
945590	948311	They also had a Dungeons & Dragons walkthrough.
948771	953313	And I'm not sure what... I mean, it was obviously supposed to be references to the movie, which I didn't see.
953413	953873	Sorry.
954633	955794	But I got the game references.
955814	957214	You have to see the movie!
957414	958475	It is fantastic!
958595	960455	I got the game references and everything.
960475	961856	Like, there's mimics and shit.
961876	964277	Like, I know enough from playing the games and any...
965197	969719	JRPG or otherwise RPG in the last years of my life.
970319	971179	I understood everything.
971199	971959	It was the same thing.
971999	972980	You were with actors.
973040	974400	You were moving from room to room.
974800	977041	I did think the D&D one was put together better.
977481	977721	I did.
978001	981743	It felt like they put more money into it because they built a whole animatronic beholder.
981763	984183	That's what you call the eyes with the Medusa things, right?
984223	984584	A beholder.
984984	987765	They had a big beholder at the end that looked really impressive.
988225	990125	The actors were getting into the show.
990326	994207	It was community theater, but it was cute.
994767	995248	It was cute.
996228	998510	I thought it was better than the Star Trek one, to be quite honest.
998551	1000913	And that really surprised me because I'm a Trek fan.
1001173	1003915	And when it comes to D&D, I'm like, I haven't even seen the movie, but it was cute.
1004236	1011782	So Phil of Nine in chat says, these experiences give the Museum of Ice Cream vibes very, very much.
1011923	1013284	It was, you know...
1013744	1042897	but I you know it's a new thing for Universal and I think if they just invest a little more in it like that whole Simpsons thing going down I would love to see them set up a permanent Star Trek thing fucking rebuild what you had at the Hilton 20 years ago at the Star Trek experience that shit was amazing rebuild that at Universal again I don't know how the Universal and Paramount arrangements work but fucking figure it out because that would be amazing to have a sense of permanent permanency I'll tell you people cosplay people dress up and Star Trek
1043237	1051499	Outnumbered everything else But there was a fair amount of Wizard Boy And there was a fair amount of, um Uh

1081140	1105566	but we'll see we'll see anyway okay sorry theme parks oh and one quick shout out i do want to say um at the kylie concert i had a brief little run-in with pixel pakas and their partner and so i got to say hello so i just want to give a shout out it was lovely to meet you both and i hope you enjoyed the concert i love i loved it i love i was so happy i went a second time i really was so uh yeah kylie's kylie's a goddess what can i say
1106406	1134106	all right um a pod culture says I need another warp core breach they did have like a 10 forward they had like a quarks cafe and a 10 forward which were just reskin versions of their normal restaurants that were selling specialty drinks and stuff but I purposely wasn't drinking last night because I had a six hour drive today so that was no and we did we did drag brunch yesterday as well which I didn't get into but I got to go to the Mickey's and WeHo which is a very you know well-known uh yeah yeah well-known gay bar I went there during drag con a couple of times
1135406	1142148	I saw some great queens there I had a really good time Is Mayhem still hosting?
1143308	1161333	No, my god, I wish I could have seen Mayhem there No, the queens were not Drag Race queens but they were still very talented I was there when Mayhem was still hosting That's awesome I think the lead's name was Beatrix Couture and then her sister Kiki or Kiko Couture was one of the
1161813	1164734	Axe, and then I do not remember the name of the third act.
1164774	1165215	I regret.
1165295	1165735	I'm sorry.
1165935	1166975	I'd have to look it up on my phone.
1167496	1168556	But they were all very talented.
1169576	1171117	So yeah, they did a good job.
1171217	1175459	Anyway, let's... Oh, hey, PixelPockets in chat says it was so nice to see you.
1175519	1176379	The concert was awesome.
1176419	1178060	Yes, thank you for the kind words from you both.
1178080	1180401	And it was great to meet you and all that good stuff.
1180461	1182462	So I'm sorry I didn't get to spend more time with you.
1182862	1186464	But we had met up right before Rita Ora was about to take the stage and we wanted to see it all.
1186484	1186604	So...
1187324	1189046	All right, let's get into video game news.
1189526	1191107	And there's some big news this week.
1191928	1193169	Loki, you want to start us off?
1193530	1195732	We kind of knew this was coming, but it sucks.
1195752	1198294	Who could have guessed that this was going to be a thing?
1198334	1199955	It sucks to hear, but here we are.
1201457	1204379	Let's take a moment and once again, thank Nintendo.
1204660	1211406	Thank you, Nintendo, for being the leaders in raising prices on your fucking games when they don't need to be raised.
1211906	1238924	and I don't want to hear about terrorist bullshit because they were going to do it anyways because they justified their game being that price and I mean when you think about it most games now are sold digitally so really they don't have to manufacture those cartridges and I'm not even sure if Mario Kart is one of those ones that actually has a cartridge in it because it may be just one of those yeah it's a license on the cart type thing I believe they have confirmed first party releases are not that
1240262	1244588	Okay, well that's good at least, but once again, doesn't matter, because guess what?
1245009	1248894	Microsoft's saying, hey, hey, hey, we want to copy Nintendo too!
1249355	1252900	And so, of course, being that that door's been, you know...
1254110	1255291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1275029	1276630	Xbox Series S $379.99 $512.01
1298526	1306269	then we have a 1TB Xbox Series S for $429.99 the Xbox Series X Digital $549.99 Xbox Series X $599.99 $599.99 that's right and then finally the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition $729.99
1325646	1325986	Why?
1326767	1328088	Why is it so much more?
1342660	1344221	especially when they're not winning the
1360254	1362515	Obviously the tariffs are to blame for the hardware increases.
1362835	1366137	DJ Ranma S in chat says, I expect Sony to do the same this week.
1366277	1367458	I 100% do as well.
1367878	1370139	I don't know what kind of stock they already have sitting in America.
1370259	1371280	That's the key question.
1371560	1376502	How much stock do these companies have sitting in America that they think they can safely burn through before the holidays?
1376562	1380504	But I think Sony has to move their hand and make an announcement similar to this as well.
1380684	1381184	It's coming.
1381645	1383566	Here's where shit gets complicated.
1384506	1386689	They did not have to raise the price of the games to $80.
1386729	1390094	And Loki's 100% on that.
1390494	1392477	And obviously Nintendo was the first.
1393018	1400608	Although I wouldn't be shocked if there wasn't some type of... And I'm not saying the big three are in cahoots...
1401189	1401689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1419184	1445557	that's where Microsoft loses me a little bit I get that they were wanting to secretly raise the price of Call of Duty and shit to $80 as well they wanted to follow suit hey if Nintendo can do this we're going to do this as well to you know get our people paid and what have you because we have these huge teams creating these games and so forth I get that I do not like the optics of them announcing that the same day as what was clearly impacted by tariffs because it makes it look like the tariffs is impacting the game prices but
1445917	1446878	I'm not a big fan of that.
1446938	1454805	But I do think, Loki, whether we like it or not, the industry sort of agreed we were going to go to $80 this year.
1463380	1464021	and Sony's gonna do it.
1464061	1471967	No, the AAA industry, no, the AAA companies decided this and you know what, fuck them because like, seriously, it doesn't matter.
1472427	1489701	They can raise the prices all they want and they can justify it all they want and then you can have the stupid fucking corporate defenders, seriously, fuck all of them, showing me a wonderful little insert from KB Toys from back in the goddamn 90s where, you know, Super Nintendo games were $90.
1490521	1491782	Guess what, folks?
1492663	1495785	Your games are much more than $90 right now.
1496186	1500789	Because you see, back in the Super Nintendo days, your game, it's done.
1501149	1501629	That's it.
1501749	1504271	You got your game, it's complete, it's done.
1504571	1507633	You're not paying $70 up front.
1507873	1511036	$20 for a fucking season pass for something.
1512256	1514697	$30 for some more DLC that may or may not come out.
1514737	1521760	You get a fucking roadmap because the game's goddamn not done because they found a way, oh, well, we could just patch it in later on.
1522021	1527183	We're getting sold unfinished games for more fucking money with more monetization on top of all that.
1527603	1530006	These companies are not scraping by by pennies.
1530206	1532888	They are making billions of fucking dollars every year.
1533209	1535952	And they can fucking afford to pay their goddamn employees.
1536172	1537073	But you know who they're paying instead?
1537093	1538975	They're paying their fucking CEOs instead.
1539295	1540596	So don't give me this fucking shit.
1540616	1545561	I'm tired of fucking hearing about the entire industry not able to put out a game for $80 or less.
1547423	1549264	Okay, they're not able to put out a game for under $80.
1550005	1550525	Bullshit!
1550785	1551886	Look at fucking Expedition 33.
1552687	1555048	Look at the fucking Oblivion fucking remaster.
1555249	1563114	Look at all these other great games that are coming out from indie studios for far less money and far more polish than this bullshit they have to pay for every single year.
1563475	1566437	Madden every single year is just fucking churned up bullshit
1567157	1591301	year after year people complain about it and they keep buying it so don't give me this shit about how oh we're so poor we're not feasible guess what if your company cannot operate within those you know within that constraint then you're not profitable then you have to just dissolve as a company it's just not gonna happen and i'm not gonna give them eighty dollars because thinking that's going to the developers bullshit they'll lay them all fucking off
1591782	1594729	After they develop their characters, write their stories, put out their games or whatever.
1594989	1597536	It doesn't matter if their game's successful, fails, whatever.
1597796	1600563	They will write them off as literal just...
1601721	1603382	tools for their fucking industry.
1603402	1607683	They're trying to get AI in there anyways already just to make the shareholder costs go up.
1607963	1609004	So fuck them all.
1609124	1610024	I'm sick and tired of it.
1610264	1617887	And honestly, I hate the impact that it's going to have on the industry as far as developers go and the layoffs that they're going to be and stuff like that.
1617927	1619388	And I hate thinking about that.
1619628	1620988	We're already living in that world.
1621548	1623269	I think this industry is ready for a crash.
1623489	1630912	I think that everybody needs to come to Jesus and fucking just, it needs a crash so they can reset and get out of this bullshit that we're in.
1633859	1634640	I don't disagree.
1635741	1636802	Like, yes.
1637983	1641265	Usually I'm like, oh, Loki, you're so harsh on Nintendo.
1641285	1644107	I honestly don't disagree with anything you just said.
1644988	1651813	Because, like, Grand Theft Auto is going to come out for $100, and then Madden's going to be like, well, we deserve $100 because our game is that pulse.
1651893	1654435	No, fucking no, it isn't, but they're going to do it.
1654495	1655656	It's going to keep going up.
1655876	1656936	You hit the nail on the head.
1656976	1659557	People in chat are saying it, and we're all thinking it.
1659657	1669420	We're all thinking it, but the people who don't realize this are the people in the boardrooms that should be shaking in their fucking boots at Claire Obscure Expedition 33.
1670640	1673281	That game, and I haven't even played it yet.
1673321	1675101	I've been so fucking busy, I haven't played it yet.
1675241	1678702	I can tell you right now, that game is going to win Game of the Year at the Game Awards.
1679142	1680122	I don't even have to play it.
1680482	1682243	I can just see on your reactions.
1682583	1686004	I can fucking see Metacritic, for better or for worse, what that site means.
1686244	1688285	I'm telling you that fucking game's winning gaming of the year.
1689265	1693087	That was 30 people, most of them laid off from a AAA studio.
1693387	1703030	They came together in France, put that game together, released it for $50, and sold a million copies in a genre that we have been told we don't want.
1704232	1706333	Now Kiyoshita, I love him to bits.
1706593	1708854	He saved the Final Fantasy Online franchise.
1709114	1718838	He got this wrong when he said that people would not want to play a turn-based RPG with the fancy graphics, that they need to have the fast, fluid stuff to go with the graphics.
1719098	1733284	He got that wrong, and Claire Obscura Expedition 33 selling one million copies in three days, in addition to it being on Game Pass, is fucking proof that should have the entire industry in the boardrooms of the AAA companies shitting
1733584	1734824	They're pants right now.
1735064	1747127	But they won't be because they are too oblivious because the people that are telling them, because all these websites will get into this that have the pulse on what gamers are really about or going under now.
1747487	1751768	So all these boardrooms have investors to rely on to get advice and shit.
1751989	1757150	And investors are going to be like, Yeah, AI is going to be the big answer.
1757190	1758670	This is what gamers want is AI.
1758850	1761391	No, the fuck we don't.
1762694	1786119	but that's gamers and board executives and boardrooms aren't listening to this podcast and if they were they unsubscribed a long time ago let me tell you so but that game should have the entire industry shitting its pants that being said I could have said pretty much the exact same thing about Baldur's Gate 3 and we haven't seen the changes yet
1787924	1793990	So I think everyone's fucking afraid of Larian because they've completely broke the mold.
1794090	1796172	It's not that they were doing DLC.
1796772	1800536	It's they were giving people more and they weren't charging for it.
1800936	1804800	They're like, you know, we think that was a good idea from so-and-so's mod.
1804940	1808543	Here's a whole new part of the game that's got those things that you were modding in.
1808583	1809524	We just made it permanent.
1811246	1813049	you know, you want to mod your game?
1813109	1819219	here, just mod it all together oh, you want full game making access to everything?
1819580	1824308	well, we'll tell these people so they'll tell you how to do it you know
1825629	1832116	Yeah, Bobby Blackwell is pointing out Hello Games as well, you know, despite all of the bullshit that No Man's Sky got in the beginning.
1845230	1850011	A game company pour the love into that game that you have from Hello Games.
1850071	1852071	And they're a relatively very small team.
1852291	1857512	I think they're a smaller group than the company that did Claire Obscure, to be honest.
1859413	1866534	And they've made their money with all this time, with all the different versions and sales and worldwide sales and all that stuff.
1866774	1867774	That's a success story too.
1868495	1870375	I think, Loki, when you say...
1871075	1872595	That the industry is going to crash.
1872855	1876536	I think the AAA industry is headed for big trouble.
1876777	1878077	You are absolutely right.
1878257	1878757	I do think.
1879257	1881178	I agree with that.
1881358	1885859	I don't think it's going to be a full industry crash because you've got a lot of indie studios out there.
1885999	1886739	The smaller teams.
1887379	1889020	The smaller teams are going to rise up.
1890163	1894287	And don't get me wrong, I don't wish for people to be laid off and all this stuff.
1894307	1896649	The problem is that they're already doing that.
1896669	1899972	They're already doing that with... And who's not getting laid off?
1900632	1901593	The bad decision makers.
1901613	1902254	The stupid CEOs.
1902674	1903175	Exactly.
1903255	1904296	And it's just...
1905376	1934077	you're not bringing any profit or any sort of like anything into this like you're making bad decisions I mean sure they may be profitable decisions but like I guess we're just at this you know point in time that you know ethics are out the window it's just what can we do to make this most profit what can we do to gather as much profit for ourselves as we can is kind of unfortunately where people are taking it I don't know what it's going to take for
1935472	1935972	Thanks for watching!
1950878	1958359	We don't need the people at the top of the existing AAA industry and the people at the top underlying Bolded.
1958639	1961660	We do not need those people to figure out the secret to success.
1961680	1963000	They're not going to fucking find it.
1963560	1972242	What we need is for these people, you know, we always say we hope these folks that get laid off are able to find something else or able to start their own studio and able to do this thing.
1972482	1980383	And the reality is not everybody has the capital, not everybody has the investor to back this, but thank gosh the team behind Clare Obscure did have that
1980723	1985548	because now they're setting a blueprint for the fuck you need Ubisoft.
1985788	1987030	You don't fucking need Ubisoft.
1988931	1989252	You don't.
1989392	1989732	Fuck them.
1990693	1991674	Look what they did without them.
1993516	1994437	And there's going to be more.
1995318	1995999	There's going to be more.
1997601	2022695	uh Bobby in chat says I said the AAA industry will crash for years and it hasn't happened yet though you know I get it I get it I feel like we've been saying that too as well I do feel like there's a lot more factors now that are going to accelerate that like tariffs uh and that whole thing uh Bobby Blackwell also says the AAA movie industry equivalent is also in a rut like this absolutely now the one thing I did want to say about you know Microsoft because you what's interesting is what you called out
2024225	2036307	You called out Claire Obscure and Oblivion Remastered as examples of what indie studios can do, even though I think we should clarify, of course, Oblivion Remastered being a Bethesda game isn't exactly indie.
2036367	2039768	However, the studio... It's still not an $80 game.
2039828	2043209	But the studio that zhuzhed it up is also a little more independent.
2044169	2044669	I can't remember.
2044869	2045649	Volt or something.
2045689	2046970	What was the name of the company that did that?
2047470	2048130	V-something?
2048290	2048750	Volcom?
2049350	2050130	No, that's a Tron thing.
2050170	2050450	I don't know.
2050950	2053411	So the company that did that is a little bit more...
2053991	2058334	Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass
2085532	2092757	especially with two huge games on it right now and more to come with your Call of Duty and, you know, other Microsoft things.
2092917	2095119	It's just, it's just something interesting.
2095639	2095980	That's all.
2097581	2097841	All right.
2099141	2103904	Well, I'll be curious to see what those console sales look like because I think it's going to be slim to none.
2103924	2106125	I think everybody knows they can get those things cheaper.
2106445	2110307	I think the second-hand market is going to become very interesting.
2110828	2111928	Thank you, Virtuos.
2111988	2114570	Thank you, Questbuster, was the studio that worked on Oblivion.
2116591	2120874	I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with those consoles.
2120914	2128278	And I think Sony, like Ranma had said earlier in chat, and I think a lot of you are thinking it too, Sony is probably going to follow this with hardware very soon.
2129943	2132146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2146414	2147675	I don't know if that will be the case.
2148375	2151637	I think people may get a little picky choosier with their game buying.
2151997	2157521	I think Mario Kart is going to be a false flag because Mario Kart is bundled with most Switch 2s at this point.
2157881	2159842	I think Mario Kart is going to be a false flag.
2160422	2167887	I will be very interested to see how things like Zelda's $90 edition and all this.
2168207	2170629	I'll be very interested to see how that actually sells.
2171269	2200665	well and that's the thing that's kind of funny about it too is like I was I watched someone like industry analysts like talk about like what they thought based off of the sales of stuff and they're like yeah look at Mario Kart sold so well by itself too I'm like yeah because people couldn't buy the bundle it was probably sold out so they were buying it separately instead like it's not that it's people aren't just buying the game by itself it's just ridiculous but yeah I think it's gonna be interesting to see I mean because I mean let's be honest like
2203042	2210746	Games can go up as much as they want, but what's not going up along with that is people's salaries.
2210946	2212908	People's salaries are not going up that.
2213168	2214769	Everything is getting more expensive.
2215209	2217710	It is going to affect everything.
2217870	2218531	That is just...
2219511	2223474	The people are not going to go without food to have Mario Kart World.
2223534	2226996	OK, like it is just going to be a thing that happens.
2227196	2238763	And it's going to hopefully get to a point where people are more selective about the games that they're picking, because then if a game is coming out unfinished from EA or whatever the case may be.
2239744	2240004	Yeah, yeah.
2259204	2261185	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2278829	2302211	which is basically piracy gamers are going to actually play their backlogs exactly, the backlogs, these little retro sticks like Loki was talking about last week that have a bunch of old games on them it plays Switch games too but yeah, it's mainly meant for older games and there's a lot of stuff I'm looking forward to getting back into trying some of these older games so
2304155	2311740	Uh, yeah, uh, RinMari in chat says, personally, the price hike doesn't really impact me as much because I mostly play lower budget indie games that are usually no more than $30.
2312320	2314521	And I think that's what a lot of people are going to start.
2314542	2323728	You're going to see more things that are a huge success like Bellatro, uh, Vampire Survivors, you know, those types of things that are relatively cheap and doing very well right now.
2323868	2328651	So, uh, QuestBuster says, on Loki's note, I'll be picky by looking more to Game Pass.
2328991	2329131	Yeah.
2329231	2329311	Yeah.
2329351	2329451	Yeah.
2345959	2351848	Oh yeah, these $90 or $80 games or whatever, they're just not going to be included in Game Pass Day 1 or something like that.
2351888	2359919	Unless you buy the fourth Ultra Super tier that is even more expensive or something like that.
2359959	2360280	I don't know.
2360360	2361822	Here comes the return of Gamefly.
2362262	2384501	which actually I believe is still a thing and I think I saw some chatter online about this but maybe there's going to be demand for you know just having you know paying a monthly fee to rent a game temporarily you know especially because it'll work with the cart licenses and all that stuff so it'll be interesting to see Bobby Blackwolf says I still have Gamefly and I'm absolutely keeping it even though they raised the price
2386587	2387468	Anyway, let's move on.
2387549	2392376	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and what we've been playing Game Pass or otherwise around the gaming sphere.
2392917	2393898	DarkSakura, we'll go to you.
2393958	2394660	How was your gaming week?
2396869	2398530	It's about the same as always.
2399451	2404073	I've been playing, I didn't actually play Mass Effect this week.
2404714	2412319	I played a lot of Palia just because I was pretty unwell on Friday and I was still feeling under the weather last night and better today.
2414120	2420664	But definitely Dead by Daylight and then, you know, a few other random bits and bobs.
2421744	2424166	We're getting a portal pinball.
2424781	2427542	Oh, I was like, ooh, like a portal to hell in your garage.
2427562	2431704	No, we're going to have the portal pinball.
2431784	2432284	That'll be fun.
2432324	2432884	Good for you.
2433064	2433824	That's great.
2434685	2434905	Awesome.
2435945	2436225	All right.
2436725	2437526	Well, then we'll go to Loki.
2437546	2438106	How was your gaming week?
2440522	2455757	I was mostly playing Minecraft this week as usual like I always do and then I was working on setting up my Retro Pocket Flip 2 so I think I have it pretty much done I'm about like 95% done with that
2457348	2474461	Vita emulation is a pain in the ass I must say but it is exciting to see how well it runs like I said it does run some Switch games I did get Mario Odyssey when I turned down the resolution a bunch on it to run somewhat well
2475221	2504222	um not that I'm probably going to be playing that because I've already played through that whole game before I just wanted to see what will actually run on it but yeah the Mario Kart stuff uh looking forward to that got all the Animal Crossings on there um so that'll be fun and uh funny enough actually a lot of like indie games um like a lot of aftermarket uh games for all these different consoles and stuff checking those out and translations be able to play a lot of stuff that hasn't been put out there um now
2505365	2512548	I would be... I, of course, need to talk about, like, my Blue Sky post earlier this week.
2512608	2525373	So, one thing I did decide to do this week as well is put my game, Pixel Poops 2, which was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System, to drop that to free.
2525533	2527454	Because everyone's paying already a ton...
2528514	2529555	in just everything.
2530116	2534919	And so why not just be able to enjoy something for free without having to pay a ton of extra money for things?
2534999	2536360	So it is free.
2536921	2542825	I mean, to be honest, I wasn't really making anything off of it anyways, but it is going to be free for...
2543886	2546067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2564218	2568103	Yeah, and then I sent YYR some messages.
2568143	2572710	I talked to him like a while ago about, you know, putting the Steam version for free.
2572730	2577356	So that should eventually follow suit as well, since he gets my messages.
2577376	2577977	Yeah.
2579353	2606894	but I know he's busy so but the very least on itch.io it's it is free so you can get it there but yeah yeah so hopefully hopefully you guys enjoy that and just glad to get people to be able to check it out and again that's pixel poops number two on itch.io and the storefront or store name is tech master games is itch.io right yes if you want to it is a free download but it is there is an option to download
2607619	2629737	Pay money if you'd like to, you don't have to though Which SSJ100 Matt in chat says buy the game now on Steam if you want to give Loki money But you do have a tip jar which is also available to give money to Yeah, it's basically free, but you can either put $0 or any amount on there But yeah, you don't have to pay for it Awesome
2630868	2633891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2648804	2650706	and then the new Diablo 4 season started.
2650747	2665023	The twist in Diablo 4 this season is a little bit, I don't know, I guess I'd call it Blue Mage because you fight bosses and then when you take down the boss, you kind of get their power and you can, you know, cycle four of them in at a time and sort of, you know, change your builds around it.
2665323	2666905	So it's kind of a neat little mechanic, I guess.
2667225	2667946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2687145	2694007	You no longer have like a tier 1, 2, 3, kind of like you have in Dead by Daylight or Fortnite where you unlock things by tier.
2694407	2704350	Instead, they made it so that you earn tokens and you use the tokens to buy what you want from the Battle Pass, which I think will be more popular.
2705030	2708551	I'm not sure it makes the Battle Pass as...
2709711	2738672	I think people will spend less to get what it is they want but maybe this is a that is the play by Blizzard to get more people to buy into this system because I'm going to guess not a lot were so that's kind of my thought it's kind of a weird system I don't like that now the smoldering ashes don't unlock for forever and they took away the ones that boost XP that part I don't like but otherwise I don't have too much to complain about I'm still playing Diablo 4 so I should tell you that
2739853	2759954	I will make it a point to get to Claire Obscure this week now that now that trip season is settled a little bit until my trip at the end of June so I have a few weeks okay um let's move on and get into other gaming news because there was quite a bit that happened this week and uh seriously a lot of changes on the internet blog front right Loki?
2761158	2764780	Yep, everybody is just getting shut down, sold, who knows.
2764920	2771364	But Fandom has essentially shut down Giant Bomb, I guess.
2772796	2783661	They, apparently, Giant Bomb had some sort of falling out with their parent company fandom, and I know that a few of the people actually left there as well.
2783921	2797508	So, apparently, creative director Dan Reichert announced that he will no longer appear on the Giant Bomb cast, and Jeff Grubb is confirmed that he is no longer with the company.
2798608	2825455	and Fandom they said that it's a strategic reset and realignment of their media brands whatever the fuck that means anyways so I don't know if they're going to be kind of resetting it into some sort of AI slop factory type thing or what they're going to be using their branding for but yeah I don't know
2827357	2855346	but that's not all Polygon has been sold to Valnet and also they have had to deal with massive layoffs so of course this is also coming out through social media as well lots of different people stating that they're no longer with the company including Chris Plant who was the Polygon co-founder and editor-in-chief um
2857608	2858148	I don't know.
2858989	2863791	I think this is also kind of one of those things where they're pivoting into more of like a content farm type thing.
2866152	2866532	I don't know.
2867592	2868553	But yeah, that sucks.
2869333	2874535	Some really good sites that are kind of going under because of this type of content.
2874575	2875996	I mean, there's a lot of these that we've
2877317	2895611	I've looked at for a while now that are just slopped now like you can hardly use them because of just the numerous guides or slideshows or whatever they want to do so you can get as many page views as possible to see as many ads as possible it's just a mess
2895851	2898653	The pivot to guides has been happening everywhere, too.
2898913	2900134	It's gross.
2902215	2919647	Unfortunately, AI is going to fuck them all with that because AI is stealing those guides and putting it into the AI system so that when people have those questions about how do I beat the boss on level two, AI is going to answer that now without having to go to those pages because AI stole from those pages.
2921728	2924690	It's really a no-win situation, I think, for a lot of those.
2926472	2929316	But... I don't know.
2929596	2930437	I'm going to be honest.
2932980	2935083	I haven't read either of those sites in a very long time.
2935684	2938447	One of those websites got rid of their biggest problem in 2017.
2940029	2941151	That's all I'm going to say about that.
2941411	2941712	But...
2944140	2946941	I just... They never really worked their way into my rotation.
2947341	2956543	I would see them linked on social media, which is the way that I think most social... I think most people are getting their gaming news.
2957043	2967466	And I think that's the reality, is that when so much news gets reduced to 300 characters or less, or whatever the limit currently is on X...
2969326	2970988	It's 300 on Blue Sky.
2971028	2977874	When the content gets reduced to that many characters or less, a lot of things get missing.
2977934	2986262	We actually have a story coming up later that is exactly this, where I think a lot of the context gets missing because of that little short headline.
2986603	2988284	But so many of us are...
2989165	3001013	getting our news from social media and those types of things now that, you know, we're not we don't have a lot of space, I think, for those more long form articles, which I'm not saying there shouldn't be a place for those.
3001273	3004835	There are some very well researched, very interesting things that I read out there.
3005556	3008638	Eurogamer still cranks out some bangers on that front.
3008678	3011559	Sometimes there's one pretty recently I read over there, I think.
3012680	3013881	And, you know, there's there's
3014542	3026055	Certain sites that do some really interesting long-form reports, but the reality is most of those short hits end up getting taken by social media.
3027219	3034706	So yeah, Ranmari in chat says, my problem with going to news sites is being subjected to ads and getting shamed for using an ad blocker.
3035367	3036848	I don't have a problem with ads.
3037068	3045236	I have a problem with the bullshit barrage of ads, especially on mobile, that like are literally just there to kill your browser.
3045916	3052543	And I would hope that the brains behind these organizations are very aware of the fact that I...
3053263	3057930	I actually way prefer Safari over Chrome right now when I'm browsing mobile.
3057970	3058390	Hell yes.
3058551	3060433	Way prefer it for two reasons.
3060553	3063417	Number one, it is very easy to flip to reader mode.
3063818	3064419	Very easy.
3064459	3066942	You do two taps and you're in reader mode.
3066962	3068665	That'll get you around CNN's paywall, by the way.
3070996	3072596	I have a second thing, by the way.
3092486	3108090	For the record, if you're using Safari on a Mac and you have developer mode enabled, which is just a click, if you go and right-click on something, inspect element, you can actually find the code for it and delete it from the active version that you're using.
3108370	3108610	Nice.
3109090	3112391	So it's just a blank area on the page.
3112551	3113471	It's beautiful.
3113511	3114952	You can hide attribute.
3115072	3116272	You can delete node.
3116932	3121660	I mean, if you reload the page, yeah, it comes back, but it's gone while you're using it.
3121740	3125225	I'd do that for half of our stories so I can at least see them be pretty.
3125766	3129933	And also, reader mode is on Mac OS Safari.
3130889	3133330	DJ Ranma S says Edge greater than Safari.
3133510	3134670	I don't know about that, but I will.
3134830	3135430	Nope.
3135470	3136851	Safari is far better.
3137291	3138131	These are all opinions.
3138531	3140752	But Safari, they don't make it on PC.
3140872	3142212	I'd probably use it if they did.
3142232	3142912	Yes, they do.
3143572	3145353	No, they haven't made it for a long time.
3145673	3146173	They used to.
3147233	3148233	8.0 or 9.0 was.
3148533	3149274	They don't make it anymore.
3149314	3149754	Hold on.
3149914	3152494	It wasn't well optimized back in the day either.
3152634	3155595	It would probably be a lot better now if they would have invested in it on PC.
3156335	3156755	But they don't.
3157116	3158436	But I will say I use...
3159236	3160898	Ranma backs me up.
3161899	3162379	I swear.
3162439	3164261	Okay, drop the download link, please.
3164882	3165642	Drop the download link.
3167004	3171208	Then I would say, and it needs to be the official download link.
3171248	3178034	Do not send me to one of those sites that says grab old version or get, I want the official Apple download link for Safari on PC, please.
3178334	3178795	I'll be waiting.
3179535	3179615	Okay.
3180456	3197616	and uh but I was gonna say with Edge and Chrome Chrome sucks now like Chrome sucks I've I've switched pretty much to using Edge much more often it's not I still do Chrome out of habit sometimes but but yeah I use Edge more than I use Chrome on desktop I will say so there is that
3198598	3200119	I haven't used Firefox in a while.
3200139	3200680	Oh, crap.
3201240	3202161	Actually, that's right.
3202241	3211009	It is still... It looks like there is still the 64-bit version, but no.
3211129	3211689	Okay, never mind.
3211749	3212370	I stand corrected.
3212630	3212890	All right.
3212930	3213191	Thank you.
3215569	3242547	but uh yeah so anyway i don't know how we got on browsers from that but um oh yeah the industry kind of shooting itself in the foot with the ad bloat uh when social media doesn't especially now blue sky as more and more people are migrating or mastodon let's you know be fair to both you know the open network protocols let's say and again like trek versus wars i myself may be on blue sky but i root for both because they are not x
3243007	3245611	So I'm rooting for both to succeed, to be quite honest.
3246072	3256767	But the thing about being the open network sort of protocol thing is that, you know, it's not even if the official Blue Sky app were to add ads.
3258533	3277220	you would be able to download a third party app and have no ads that will happen in the next year I guarantee it Blue Sky's first party app is going to have ads at some point and then you'll just download a third party app to get around it that's going to happen as Blue Sky gets bigger and bigger so there's that um
3278590	3282732	So, yeah, Rimari in chat says there's already third-party apps for Blue Sky.
3282772	3296599	There sure are because there was a whole thing about Blue Sky was asked to suppress accounts in a particular country or I think they risked being – I don't know all the facts, so I am cutting corners.
3296859	3297579	I fully admit.
3298099	3301141	I believe they were risking running illegally there.
3301201	3301961	Was it Turkey?
3302962	3306643	It was – or Turkey or whatever you're supposed to pronounce it now.
3307024	3307704	Turkey, yeah.
3307924	3309045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3325171	3326051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3341559	3344560	But that's what leads to also some of the controversy.
3344920	3347482	You know, I saw Ranma also say, I don't feel safe on Blue Sky.
3347522	3351603	And I think that has to do with all the information that's public on a site like Clear Sky.
3351663	3353804	You can see who you've blocked, who's blocked.
3353824	3355285	You know, some people don't like that.
3355625	3361267	But that is kind of a downside to running openly like that is that all that is available.
3361788	3369131	They have said that they're working on some sort of privatization embedded within the app protocol for people that want private accounts.
3369651	3372473	but I would expect that's still going to be another six months out.
3372733	3376195	We'll see what happens in the future with that.
3376996	3378417	I want people to know I blocked them.
3378797	3379597	Yeah, that's fine.
3379998	3395968	And my problem with Mastodon, just to be fair to both sides, is that my problem with Mastodon is that some people ran their servers like they were HOAs and if you couldn't trust the server to be the right individual, you might end up with somebody who's just going to basically end up
3396368	3398069	Throwing your blog away.
3398429	3406172	But the URL you start directing people to is going to vanish because their hosted Mastodon thing ends up vanishing.
3406452	3408773	And there's just some issues I had with that.
3408893	3411814	I just felt Blue Sky was kind of hitting on that a little better.
3411934	3413375	But you are free to make your choice.
3414035	3419137	And again, I still support both because again, Elon Musk can never own neither.
3419917	3421978	So either is fine by me.
3424192	3428194	DJ Ranma S says, I know the two people who have me blocked on Blue Sky and they can both kiss my ass.
3428555	3429115	Only two?
3429695	3431997	I have like 53 and they can all kiss my ass.
3433918	3434598	I don't give a fuck.
3435839	3445445	The reality is, I might have a hot take trademark that makes its way onto the Discover feed and somebody just decides they don't like it so they're going to block me.
3445945	3449848	Or there's a picture of me and they don't like my old face so they're going to block me.
3450248	3453130	And you just have to deal with the fact that some people are just...
3454508	3467204	mean like why why why why should we care I know I don't I don't fuck those people they don't belong in my life I don't care yeah their loss I mean why is it important yeah
3468578	3470919	They've removed themselves from my universe.
3471160	3471700	Thank you.
3471740	3472860	You save me effort.
3473281	3475362	Eat a bag of dicks while you're at it.
3475402	3478763	Tiger Claw says there was a site that shows you who has blocked you on Blue Sky.
3478803	3479864	Yes, it's called Clear Sky.
3480844	3482265	Yeah, I've used that.
3483205	3485026	Because I had to laugh at certain people.
3485947	3488408	Alright, let's move on.
3488468	3496812	Let's talk about a lawsuit that really shouldn't surprise me, but it's one of those things where, oh yeah, I kind of forgot this happened.
3497881	3504963	But maybe what Nintendo was trying to avoid was that whole Streisand effect of if you sue it, you're confirming it.
3505503	3509364	Well, now that Nintendo's confirmed the Switch 2, guess what?
3509964	3511604	They're suing Genki.
3512465	3520046	You might remember that Genki had unauthorized mock-ups of the Switch 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2025.
3521367	3526128	In the lawsuit that was filed on Friday, Nintendo has accused Genki of trademark infringement
3526548	3531513	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3542603	3549769	They actually, I believe, used some posts on X in the lawsuit, too.
3549789	3557475	At one point, Genki said they do not own or possess a black market console, but they basically highly implied that they had access to all the specs.
3557655	3559857	They had somebody on the inside.
3559977	3563000	Maybe they were getting information or buying it.
3563040	3563360	Who knows?
3563400	3563700	Who knows?
3564281	3568244	But Nintendo is basically saying those statements were contradictory and inconsistent.
3568564	3569365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3588317	3590418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3603775	3613543	love them or hate them, especially when it comes to Nintendo's legal department, love them or hate them, you can't deny they did the smart thing here.
3614024	3618307	They waited until the news was out there, then they sued them.
3619699	3628401	They waited to be the ones and say, yes, confirmed, rather than let the lawsuit say, yes, confirmed, as has happened so many other times in the industry.
3628841	3637063	So, love them or hate them, give Nintendo's legal department that ounce of credit that they waited until the right time to do it.
3639303	3643084	When this happened, I was looking at Genki going, they're going to get sued.
3645017	3645978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3663388	3675195	Talking about, though, people actually doing something good, Epic Games has actually set out to eliminate revenue fees for smaller developers.
3675255	3683239	They've done a new fee structure going into effect in June, and it will apply to a developer's revenue on a per-app basis.
3683880	3690884	So after the first million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12% fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.
3691964	3714020	So basically, that will help small developers who may not expect to get those big sales to start with And it's not the first time that they've done things to help out In 2011, they basically were like, you know, don't worry about the royalty payments At least for the first $50,000 in sales that were made with the Unreal Development Kit
3715401	3725255	in 2020 it was increased to cover the first million in lifetime sales for a project so and I mean
3727314	3754484	I guess they're kind of fighting back and forth a little bit with Valve on this because Valve in 2018 they cut their default 30% to 25% and that's for lifetime per game earnings exceeding $10 million and then it goes down to 20% after $50 million but honestly though this is fairly generous for the smaller developers so
3756279	3756632	There you go.
3757970	3764633	Yeah, it's interesting to see the little store wars continuing that, you know, there is a little competition in that space.
3764673	3767174	And I'm sure there are plenty of other folks that would love to get in that space.
3767234	3773737	I mean, technically, like good old games kind of tries to carve their niche in the whole, you know, preservation program.
3773757	3775678	So there are even, you know, third options out there.
3775738	3781861	But it's interesting to see how these two stores are trying to attract developers and exclusives and all that good stuff.
3782121	3782782	So yeah, yeah.
3783162	3785083	PodCulture says LOL store wars.
3785183	3786523	Well, I guess it is May the 4th.
3786623	3787244	So there you go.
3788425	3791191	Revenge of the Steam tomorrow on this report, who knows alright
3794542	3795823	Now coming out May 2026.
3823459	3823899	or not.
3823999	3824620	Who knows?
3825560	3826040	Nobody.
3827161	3827801	Nobody knows.
3827881	3832763	They're waiting for that $80 price tag to be standard so that they feel no guilt in charging $90.
3832823	3835004	Yeah, I'm sure they're waiting for that.
3836725	3838506	I don't think that has anything to do with it.
3838566	3839506	Maybe it'll go up to $100.
3840607	3842167	Maybe if we just buy it our time.
3842608	3844008	For a collector's edition?
3844248	3845069	Absolutely.
3845849	3849031	No, I think for the standard price, it's easily going to be $90.
3849571	3852152	They're going to push the envelope, I think.
3852850	3864818	I think they're going to try to... I think it's still $80 and there's a robust way to spend more money inside the game with things like Grand Theft Auto Online.
3865198	3874384	I think that's sort of the difference between Grand Theft Auto and this situation is that they have a very robust online economy as well.
3875509	3881412	Yes, they haven't made billions upon billions upon billions upon billions of dollars from this game or the previous game already.
3882472	3888935	Anyways, I mean, I could tell you the reasons why they delayed it, but you know the lines already.
3890215	3894617	They need more time to polish it up to make it better.
3895758	3895898	So...
3896792	3898675	I don't really need to read why.
3899676	3904984	Hey, if they aren't crunching as a result, that's actually good news, I think.
3905184	3905564	You know?
3906886	3908008	Are they not...
3908749	3909590	Are we sure about that?
3909810	3910591	I mean, I don't know.
3911072	3919141	I think there's some pull quote out there that says they're doing this in part to reduce their need for that, which if that... I hope so.
3919322	3920083	I hope so, too.
3920203	3923667	Like, I just... I don't... Exactly.
3923787	3924408	I get it.
3924588	3924968	I get it.
3925089	3926771	A healthy amount of skepticism with that.
3929122	3954845	is a totally appropriate um but you know we'll see what happens come April you know what the reports are saying in March or April next year before this goes gold if they're or especially during the holidays how how bad they're maybe having to crunch during the holidays so we'll see but you know what I remember when Animal Crossing got delayed it got delayed to 2020 in March and it ended up being the best delay Nintendo could have ever scheduled for a game
3957586	3960228	Not that I'm asking for COVID part two.
3961309	3964571	But sometimes delays don't end up being the end of the world.
3964591	3965992	How about second COVID?
3966413	3966893	No.
3968894	3972297	How about the one that just locks the people we don't like in their houses?
3973145	3974866	Well, how about Super Chlamydia?
3974886	3980027	Because that's going to be a thing because of all the things that they're shutting down at the federal level.
3980128	3982168	But anyway, I don't want to digress.
3982208	3985709	We're going to let loose a whole bunch of koalas into the world.
3986470	3988150	All of us ace people will be safe.
3989911	3994872	Bonds006 in chat says, just asking how many years before they sunset the GTA 5 servers?
3995373	3998774	Well after GTA 6 is already up and running, that's for sure.
3999821	4000442	and DarkSakura.
4013283	4013663	All right.
4014343	4015523	Well, hey, you know what?
4015603	4021045	Let's use that to transition to a story about something else that kept support for a very long time.
4022265	4032847	The Louvre, the museum in France, has ended their official support of the Nintendo 3DS console audio guides.
4033287	4035788	This was actually a big deal when this rolled out.
4035808	4036548	What's going on?
4039113	4042735	Yeah, in 2012, there was a whole Nintendo 3DS Direct.
4043096	4047479	Actually, no, it was in 2013, I think, when the actual Direct was.
4047839	4050561	But the 3DS Audio Guides, I guess, started a little bit earlier.
4051361	4056205	And it told you all about exhibits in English, French, of course, and many other languages as well.
4056565	4058906	And you could hear about the history of the Louvre.
4059647	4061668	You could hear about the artwork inside.
4061988	4064630	You could see high-resolution images and all that good stuff.
4064790	4064950	But...
4066352	4079913	The guide is set to go out of operation in September of 2025 They are saying the 3DS will be replaced by a new system That's leading a lot of people to assume it could be a Switch or a Switch 2
4081175	4088080	I don't understand why it wouldn't just be mobile phones at this point, but I guess either of those is potential.
4088500	4090862	But keep in mind, this museum is gigantic.
4090902	4094844	There is over 780,000 square feet.
4095124	4102049	I've actually always wanted to go, and it's not just for the Mona Lisa, but I love those museums you can just get lost in all fucking day.
4102329	4104651	Like the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
4106232	4110536	What I went, my biggest regret was I really should have booked all day for this place.
4110976	4112198	I didn't book myself enough time.
4112578	4117362	Or the Smithsonian, which isn't even just one museum.
4117382	4119865	It's obviously, you need like a week.
4120065	4122067	I have literally gotten lost in the Smithsonian.
4122187	4122887	I will admit that.
4123008	4124789	Yeah, it's gigantic.
4124809	4128433	So anyway, I would love to go here someday, but it's just, you know.
4129502	4130542	Let's move on to DarkSakura.
4154249	4154770	Yes, let's.
4155891	4157412	Now, this is not so good news.
4158733	4168203	And in news of no one being surprised, EA basically is laying off about 300 to 400 positions.
4168323	4172447	That's around 100 at Respawn and then the others.
4175190	4176591	They did...
4179119	4182563	I just am not sure exactly what these companies are thinking.
4183064	4187168	But here is a statement that was put out.
4187188	4195738	It's like, we've made the decision to step away from two early stage incubation projects and make some targeted adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi.
4196018	4197119	This came from Respawn.
4198181	4198281	Um...
4199756	4224115	and in January, EA had lowered its annual bookings forecast so yeah, it's coming down and this is including cancelling a Titanfall game so this was all reported by Bloomberg a few days ago who's surprised?
4225765	4226746	Well, it's unfortunate.
4227286	4229548	I'm going to read the bullshit statement that got released.
4229668	4229969	Okay.
4230649	4234833	And you know it's a bullshit statement because they try to do those fancy keywords.
4234853	4236594	And I'll try to translate into English, okay?
4237695	4250767	As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively align teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.
4251247	4251487	So...
4252228	4258271	Translation, the CEO wants another Lamborghini, but if we don't make certain profits, he won't be able to afford it.
4258411	4261933	So we're laying off all these people so that their pay goes to the Lamborghini fund.
4264555	4265115	Sound about right?
4265535	4266796	Yeah, unfortunately, it sure does.
4269836	4270356	It's sad.
4270476	4273758	You hope that these people land on their feet somewhere.
4273838	4277199	You hope there's a Claire Obscure story in here somewhere.
4277639	4283521	But the reality is there are some people that are going to take this with the layoff news and everything and go, you know what?
4284381	4293326	I'm going to take these skills to the banking industry or the insurance industry or try to find a compatible type of thing for my skills in another industry.
4293646	4295067	The games industry just isn't for me.
4295807	4303051	And that's sad that we're going to lose some great art because of that because millions wasn't enough.
4303091	4303871	They needed billions.
4304632	4310375	Did you see they're having a big massive sale, by the way, on Steam right now?
4311125	4311646	No, I didn't.
4311666	4313487	I haven't been on Steam in a little bit.
4313907	4318490	Like the Mass Effect Legendary Edition?
4319810	4320211	Six bucks.
4320991	4323613	Yeah, that's been really marked down in a few sales now.
4323693	4324553	But yeah, that's cool.
4324613	4326094	That's cool.
4326454	4333518	But I mean, there's like the Dragon Age games are pretty going down.
4333558	4335079	There's a lot of stuff.
4335279	4337161	So yeah, just thought I'd mention it.
4337581	4337761	Cool.
4338991	4341346	Alright, well let's move on to Loki.
4342895	4348379	So Nintendo's doing some updates in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2.
4349099	4365790	So there was a brand new Switch update, version 20.0.0, which added the system transfers to Switch 2, as well as the new console game share features via virtual cards.
4366471	4372215	However, some folks are saying that they don't like the changes because they can't play
4373436	4380202	One version of the game across two systems at the same time, which, I mean, yeah, that makes sense that you can't do that.
4380302	4385247	I think that if you were able to do that prior, that sounds like an exploit that they just patched now.
4386028	4397679	But what they used to do is essentially that one person starts the game and then while the game is running, transfers that game to another person who then starts the game and then starts playing on that system.
4398018	4400419	to like, for example, play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
4400599	4402120	That sounds like an exploit to me.
4402700	4406502	So it makes sense that it doesn't work that way.
4406642	4410023	I don't know why people are disappointed about this, but okay.
4410423	4414025	I mean, I can't take a game and make two games out of it.
4414325	4414945	So I don't know.
4415606	4422329	At the very least, with the next Switch console, you still got that kind of share play stuff that they had with like the 3DS and DS and stuff like that.
4422629	4423409	So that'd be kind of cool.
4423449	4426431	But yeah, unfortunately, you're not going to be able to
4428171	4431795	Convert one game into two to play Mario Kart Online.
4431915	4433376	You cannot wish for more wishes.
4434097	4435338	Yeah, you cannot wish for more wishes.
4435979	4442425	Along with that, they also made some changes to the eShop, especially on how they show the best sellers.
4443006	4450653	So best sellers originally would show the... It was arranged by total downloads over the last 14 days, and so you would get a lot of shovel...
4451354	4459176	Shovelware stuff that just kind of releasing games constantly so that they would always be in the best sellers or newly released list type things.
4459416	4467297	However, now they're calculating it based off of the last three days worth of revenue that those games had made.
4467878	4469858	So, based on the sales.
4471138	4471818	That is better.
4471959	4474379	There's still an issue with a lot of Shovelware stuff.
4474459	4478460	Hopefully that gets a little bit less of a problem on the Switch too, but...
4479921	4482963	Yeah, I mean, any improvements better than what we had.
4484924	4488426	I'm curious if anyone out there has used that virtual card update.
4488767	4494570	I looked at it and I was poking around, but Alan barely plays his Switch that he has now.
4494910	4500174	He wants a Switch 2 because he says he'll play Switch 1 games on a Switch 2 because that's how he is.
4500194	4501674	So I said, okay, whatever makes you happy.
4502695	4507378	But I have not yet really experienced the trading thing to see how that all works.
4507398	4508459	So I'm curious if any of you...
4509479	4514800	Also, Alan and I are not currently on a family plan, but I'll put him on my plan once he's actually playing a Switch.
4515360	4516801	So, we'll see.
4517481	4526303	Alright, anyway, earlier in the show I mentioned, hey, there's this story that I think maybe social media's abbreviation could have kind of ruined.
4526563	4530084	And that has to do with this Chrono Trigger remake news.
4530624	4530944	I mean...
4531824	4540209	We all kind of feel like a Chrono Trigger remake is going to happen at some point, but feelings don't make things true, and it especially doesn't make them true today.
4541429	4545391	But, so apparently what happened is that there was...
4547252	4557078	A panel that was happening in Italy or something, Napoli Comic Con was happening, and Yuji Horii was actually one of the guests that was there.
4557398	4573307	And through some news that came in through Reddit, Yuji Horii confirms Chrono Trigger remake at Comic Con in Naples, where basically the audience kind of went crazy because he said something along and the translator said, if this is true, this is big.
4574648	4578550	Give me a confirmation, says the person who's running the panel.
4579070	4580992	And the translator says, you heard nothing.
4581312	4585214	So there may have even been a translation weird thing that was going on.
4585614	4589857	And sure enough, later on, an update came in.
4589877	4591798	There was footage from the panel.
4592239	4593239	It was in Italian.
4593259	4594180	It was in Japanese.
4594620	4597202	They say it was discussed about a remake of it.
4597562	4598522	But then in a...
4599483	4600083	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4619867	4622108	It basically, yeah.
4622709	4629513	It became this, oh, Chrono Trigger remake confirmed by Yuji Horii himself, which he's not going to do at a random Italian Comic Con.
4629853	4633115	No disrespect to the Italian Comic Con, which I'm sure is a fine event.
4633676	4635017	No disrespect, but he's not going to...
4635817	4636958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4664116	4678252	but again, this whole Claire Obscure ought to be making them turn their heads right now especially since you know Final Fantasy 17 is well into development at this point and I don't think they're going to be able to turn the ship around with whatever they're doing for Final Fantasy 17
4679193	4706011	Be it online, be it a single player game that's more action oriented like XVI We don't know, there's a million ways that game could be going But you know that game is well in development Because I think the thing they are going to do this time They're going to follow XVI's model of We are not announcing this shit until it's out in 18 months We're not going to do this 10 year lead up like we did with Final Fantasy XV So, but you gotta know they're looking at it
4707250	4714015	So I think it just goes to show that sometimes a simpler time and a simpler game is really the games that people want.
4714456	4715837	So that takes us to our next segment.
4726845	4734151	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4734611	4737053	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4738086	4746053	Jamie, I'm not sure there is a more appropriately timed classic game of the week ever before than what you are doing tonight.
4746934	4748335	You don't think I didn't do it on purpose?
4748375	4750537	You absolutely did it on purpose and it's brilliant.
4750677	4751438	Tell us all about it.
4752677	4757679	It is the 1983 Atari Star Wars arcade game.
4760741	4761421	Yeah.
4761781	4764423	If you skip a bit ahead, you'll also get to some music, too.
4764443	4765963	I don't know if it's playing on the stream.
4766024	4767584	No, I haven't really been playing.
4768044	4770726	Especially this music could be a little dicey, but...
4771246	4772747	Just with copyright claims, but yes.
4772787	4777509	At any rate, the game is a first-person rail shooter.
4777709	4783852	It was designed by Mike Halley, and it was released in 1983 by Atari.
4784052	4793177	It uses 3D color vector graphics to simulate the assault on the Death Star from the original Star Wars.
4795038	4820795	there are three different connected gameplay sequences there's combat against TIE fighters and then flying across the surface of the Death Star and then the trench run it then just keeps repeating and getting more and more complicated with the Death Star regenerating your X-Wing has a shield and it protects from damage a certain number of times and then the next hit ends the game
4821275	4824577	It has speech synthesis to emulate the actors in the film.
4825678	4831561	And this was considered, it's like on the list of one of the greatest video games of all time.
4833002	4836064	There were ports, there's all kinds of stuff.
4836084	4840367	And there was also an arcade sequel that was sold as a conversion kit in 1985 as Star Wars 6.
4842488	4871180	The Empire Strikes Back of course so you don't have to so in playing the game you don't have to like destroy every TIE fighter you just have to survive for a set number of time and then you have three attack phases in each wave so there you go so in the phase one you hear the Imperial March or another one of the Star Wars songs playing during the dog fight with Vader and the TIE fighters and
4871540	4877665	and then base 2, you have to go to the surface of the Death Star to reach the trench.
4879966	4882468	It is omitted during the first wave of the game.
4882848	4894237	So you get attacked by artillery on the surface and then you get laser turrets on towers and all of that.
4894637	4896699	You also get bonus for destroying the turrets.
4897239	4899020	And in phase three, that's the trench run.
4899620	4905923	So if you fail to hit the exhaust port, you lose a shield and you have to do the trench again.
4906743	4917208	So if you manage to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, you are awarded points for using the force.
4917828	4919329	And then you go back to the first phase.
4920910	4931195	So the game started development in 1981 with the title Warp Speed, and it was headed up by Ed Rodberg, who also worked on Battlezone.
4932135	4940880	The controller was designed for Army Battlezone, which was a Bradley fighting vehicle training simulator that Atari made for the US Army.
4941820	4960849	Redberg left Atari and so Atari had signed a licensing agreement with Lucasfilm and then they finished the game of Star Wars so it was actually tested with focus groups January 24th 1983 by groups of 15 to 19 year old men 20 to 35 year old men and 17 to 30 year old women and
4966732	4987038	So as for the ports, it was converted first by Parker Brothers along with iMagic in 83 and 84 to come out on the Atari 2600, 5200, the Atari 8-bit computers, ColecoVision and Commodore 64 The ColecoVision version was programmed by one Wendell Brown
4990059	5013245	so going forward there was another conversion 87 and 88 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro and then further converted again for the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64 those versions were developed by a group called Vector with a K, Graphics with an X
5014425	5016806	Although the Atari 8-bit version was by Zeppelin Games.
5017807	5020288	They were published in Europe by Domark.
5021328	5027091	Braderbund acquired the license to develop Star Wars games in the same year.
5028211	5028391	And
5030052	5041039	They published the Mac version, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS versions of the arcade games in North America in 1988, and then republished the Atari ST and Amiga versions in 89.
5042559	5048203	The Amiga and Atari ST have mouse control and have digitized sound effects.
5049283	5055107	The Mac version has sampled speech from the films, but no in-game music other than just the attract mode.
5056568	5078290	it also appeared on the GameCube in Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike as a bonus minigame you could unlock after doing a level or doing a cheat code and also in the US and some European countries if you pre-ordered the game you got a special copy with that mode unlocked upon startup
5079491	5083774	The game was Atari's top-selling 1983 arcade release.
5083974	5085114	They produced 12,695 cabinets.
5089109	5090991	It topped the play meter in the U.S.
5091272	5092833	for street locations in October 1983.
5094054	5102682	In Japan, Game Machine listed Star Wars on their November 1st, 1983 issue as being the most successful cockpit game.
5103563	5110630	Compute Magazine also said the Atari ST version was quote, "...amazing, smoothly animated."
5113368	5122594	It was also reviewed in Dragon Magazine, the Butterbund versions for MS-DOS, Amiga, ST, Commodore 64.
5125236	5129299	In this role of computers column and said the game had 3 out of 5 stars.
5129499	5135023	Macworld said the Mac version was fast-paced action and challenging in higher levels.
5135223	5135884	So, I mean...
5136664	5144374	The only real criticism from Macworld was that the master disk-based copy protection it
5146954	5153918	It was a little bit harsh and said that the only three playable scenarios were limited replay value.
5155919	5161022	So yeah, this is probably on the record of some of the top games ever.
5161082	5165684	Several places have listed this as in their top 50 games of all time.
5165904	5171007	It's included in the top 100 arcade games of all time by the killer list of video games in 2001.
5173329	5192286	but like I mentioned earlier the Star Wars arcade machines could be converted into Empire Strikes Back with a conversion kit and also the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ones were included also as extra content on Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike and
5193985	5205892	The Tastemakers LLC Arcade 1-Up division did a three-quarter scale recreation of the original cabinet with emulated versions of Star Wars Arcade, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.
5207552	5211835	In 1984, Robert Rookzek, I hope I pronounced that right,
5212355	5217498	scored 300 million points in 49 hours of gameplay, and that was the world record at the time.
5218739	5226725	And then in 2005, Brandon Erickson set a world endurance record of 54 hours on a single credit with a score of 283 million.
5228005	5240334	June 85, Flavio Tosi, Dave Roberts, and Mike Ogren played as a team in turns for five days, two hours, and 26 minutes on a single credit to get the world record score of 1,000,012 points.
5242875	5243035	Yes.
5243715	5244476	One, bunch of zeros, 12.
5246296	5251138	Verified in September 1985 edition of Computer and Video Games.
5251338	5252878	They raised money for charity that way.
5254699	5257840	The score counter turns over at 100 million points.
5259240	5285375	um it was uh they uh was decided to put machines on a harder setting for Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard um in an 86 tournament David Palmer scored 31,666,614 points in seven hours about seven hours a score that was published in the Guinness Book of World Records and remains unbeaten to this day and there you go wow
5287417	5289078	I always love little messages on the planet.
5289118	5289978	That was always my favorite.
5290679	5294982	May the force be with you on that particular one we see in the video there live at Twitch TV.
5295042	5298324	But yeah, I definitely agree.
5299645	5302387	A, I can't believe you'd never picked this before, but I say that every week.
5303187	5304268	But what a great, timely...
5305509	5306890	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5328791	5354114	but every time I'm at Bobby's house at Black Wolf Manor and play his machine I'm like man I should have gotten one of these this is so fun so such a unique control mechanism too it's great all right let's hit on a few quick hit stories and then uh we'll get to world release dates and uh towards the end of the show believe it or not but I'm okay with that because your boy is tired after a long day driving all right so let's get to rapid fire news Loki
5355693	5370482	Yes, so apparently Jack Black's, one of the songs from the Minecraft movie, has broken a Billboard chart record for the shortest song to be in their top 100.
5371083	5377967	And that is, of course, Steve's Lava Chicken, which is a very, very short song.
5378067	5378187	It's...
5380309	5381310	34 seconds long.
5381750	5388837	The previous record was held by Kid Cudi's song Beautiful Trip, which is 37 seconds long.
5390859	5391119	All right.
5391139	5392581	And it reached 78 out of 100.
5395540	5399182	I guess that's probably the way they rank things now with streaming and stuff.
5399682	5408506	I could see how short songs, it's a little different now than buying a CD for a 30-second song with streaming and everything.
5408526	5410807	Kids are probably playing it at parties and stuff.
5410847	5414468	It's probably racking up the streaming credits, so that makes sense.
5415409	5415729	DarkSakura?
5415929	5416149	Yeah, so...
5423129	5424109	Yuzo Koshiro.
5424690	5427191	Here's a name that we all love and adore.
5427391	5427731	Love him.
5429051	5435114	Yeah, the game he's involved with for Mega Drive or Genesis is called Eartheon.
5435954	5444918	And the website has gone live and it will be coming out for Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series.
5444958	5446959	We know there is a Steam release coming out.
5447779	5450000	I'm still trying to see if there's going to be a Genesis version.
5451360	5454661	But we're going to have this published by Limited Run Games.
5455801	5458942	There's video of it running on a Mega Drive.
5462123	5463944	But I want it.
5464684	5465104	I want it.
5465144	5465804	It's pretty.
5466704	5469425	And the music, of course, is freaking fantastic.
5469765	5471426	And I can't wait for the soundtrack either.
5472186	5472426	Nice.
5472546	5473306	It looks so good.
5473466	5475007	Yeah, the soundtrack will be the best part.
5476790	5477652	But the game might be good too.
5477712	5478794	I don't want to discredit that.
5478894	5481118	And there's also going to be an upgraded arcade release.
5481459	5482000	Yeah, that's cool.
5482120	5482461	That's cool.
5482581	5484305	With no slowdown and better audio.
5485322	5493867	Well, speaking of upgraded arcade releases of a different context, we have the news on the first release in the Arcade Archives 2 series.
5493927	5494307	That's right.
5494748	5496709	Arcade Archives was so big, so much.
5496889	5498370	They are moving to Arcade Archives 2.
5498910	5499250	I don't know.
5499390	5506575	I don't think they need to rebrand with a 2, but I guess because now it's going to be a different selection of hardware that this is going to be on.
5506935	5509937	So now these are games that will release specifically on Switch 2.
5510877	5516738	As we've previously seen and confirmed, Arcade Archives 2 for the PlayStation 5.
5517538	5519759	The first game will be Ridge Racer.
5519959	5521479	I always love any excuse to say that.
5521779	5522699	But here's the interesting thing.
5523059	5527320	For the PlayStation 4, you still have Arcade Archives Ridge Racer without the 2.
5527860	5533262	So I'm not sure if the 2 is supposed to denote maybe a different set of features or what's going on there.
5533362	5538963	But yeah, I guess they're saying it's more fun and more user-friendly in Arcade Archives 2.
5539923	5540223	I don't know.
5540863	5547027	Um, but I'm sure people are excited to hear that it's coming to the PlayStation 5 as well.
5547428	5557555	And my assumption was the reason why we were doing an Arcade Archives 2 sort of series was because now maybe like the hardware they're going to emulate is going to be a little bit of a better step.
5557855	5557935	So
5558135	5560078	Arcade Archives 2, PlayStation 4, Switch 1
5574339	5582781	Watch out on Switch, though, because some of those titles that showed up in the doesn't currently work list were arcade archives, but that's not to say the developer won't fix those.
5582841	5585521	Just know what you're getting into with all that.
5585561	5592502	But that's still really cool about Ridge Racer, the original arcade release being available for the PlayStation 5, as it ought to be.
5594142	5595683	All things come full circle in the end.
5596303	5599743	Let's travel around the world and check out release dates and see what's coming full circle this week.
5600364	5602804	Oh, I'm sorry, not DarkSakura, Loki first, then we'll do the...

5676223	5680466	All right, we'll go to Japan for the Japanese releases coming out of Golden Week last week.
5680767	5682248	We're back in the swing of things.
5682268	5683169	Yeah, America, go last.
5684670	5688013	On the Nintendo Switch, we have Tokimeki Memorial Forever With You Emotional.
5688873	5690915	We also have that in a regular and a deluxe edition.
5692717	5694898	I think that's actually the only big release this week.
5694938	5695839	That's on May 8th.
5696600	5696860	That's...
5696920	5698621	It's it for Japan on the Switch.
5699082	5702605	Checking the PlayStation 5 just to see if we're in a similar situation.
5703065	5704066	Yeah, still pretty slow.
5704106	5706608	I guess I thought maybe it would pick up out of Golden Week, but not really.
5706769	5709171	But a new Tokimeki Memorial game is going to interest some people.
5709231	5710151	So you got that.
5711072	5711913	Loki, fine.
5712133	5712654	US's turn.
5713786	5714026	All right.
5714827	5718490	We have Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition on PlayStation 5.
5718710	5721172	Yet another Xbox game coming over to the platform.
5721872	5727477	Captain Blood on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5728378	5730739	High on Life on Nintendo Switch.
5731760	5735683	Metal Eden on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

5745946	5748688	We have The Midnight Walk on PC and PlayStation 5.
5749949	5754733	Revenge of the Savage Planet on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5755393	5760477	Spirit of the North 2 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
5761618	5766021	Vanbrace Dungeon Monarch comes out of early access on PC.
5767222	5784452	Yes, Your Grace, Snowfall on PC, on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Little Kitty, Big City, and last but not least, Spirit Fall on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
5785453	5785773	Alright.
5786473	5790436	Well, we have one more news story tonight, and what a shitty note to end on, Loki.
5793067	5801476	Well, you know, tariffs are affecting everything, and everything includes replica Atari 2600 cartridges.
5802277	5802978	That's right.
5803218	5805821	So Atari has been putting out some...
5807987	5834740	replica cartridges I think those are 2600 plus they did recently 2600 plus so of course they wanted to share that tariffs have infected their business and of course with the recent increases they're going to have to raise the price of those cartridges up a bit so the replica cartridges will go from 30 to 33 dollars and then of course
5835840	5839442	Apparently, I know that there's some that were going up $10 as well.
5839883	5843025	Also, all of the accessories are going up by $5.
5843445	5849189	I mean, all things considered, that's not a huge price increase, but it's the principle, right?
5849349	5850910	Like, it's just... Oh, I'm sorry.
5850930	5852411	I read that it's $10.
5852551	5852831	It's 10%, so $3.
5852991	5853471	Yeah.
5853511	5855012	But still.
5855192	5856653	Still, I mean, it's everything.
5856934	5857734	Yeah.
5857774	5858835	What's that money going to?
5859994	5870890	you know it's just it's going to yeah the cost of those things there's a uh it's not the food and drug administration like it's not necessarily the games industry but there's a great um
5872128	5875890	Oh gosh, there's... I don't know if it was ReviewTech.
5876010	5892597	It was one of the tech channels, GamersNexus, did an in-depth piece on the whole tariff situation and how it's affecting PC parts manufacturers and system integrators and stuff like that.
5892997	5894237	And talking about kind of...
5896255	5898501	Just how ridiculous it is.
5898782	5903233	Some of these larger companies obviously are going to be able to absorb this, but smaller companies...
5904178	5929800	they just may go out of business and it really gets down into the details like there's some of these companies where they're talking about like we manufacture this PC case and like we're going to be fully transparent here's all the costs here's the cost of the tariffs here's all of this stuff here's what we would have to mark this up to to even make a profit on it like we are making we are losing money on these essentially so it's a very interesting piece
5932188	5933810	Alright, well, we'll see.
5933910	5939095	I mean, and then who knows, maybe, you know, Dear Leader changes his mind tomorrow, so we'll see what happens.
5940217	5942799	Yeah, as Joe and Matt says, elections have consequences.
5942899	5944001	Yeah, we know.
5944561	5945762	We sadly, sadly know.
5947592	5949254	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5970516	5974619	Maybe this is an excuse for me to pick it back up because I think they did release a new set as well.
5974679	5976801	But now it's like, oh God, am I going to be too far behind?
5977241	5977542	We'll see.
5977582	5987229	So sorry if I stopped liking all your stuff in that game, but I literally stopped checking it like maybe three weeks ago or whenever that shiny set came out and I was getting shitty pulls every single day.
5987810	5994214	So anyway, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place where you can send your future emails if you want.
5995075	5997337	With that, I'm going to check with Loki on any last minute stories.
5999242	5999462	No.
5999882	6001023	Yeah.
6001763	6005625	It's been a big week, but I think we hit on all the big stuff already.
6005705	6007685	So we'll see what the coming days bring.
6007725	6011067	Hey, believe it or not, we're like a month out from Summer Game Fest and all that news.
6011647	6013928	And then the Switch 2 is released.
6013948	6017009	The year has gone by so fast and yet so slow.
6017049	6022291	That Switch 2, like the way Nintendo is releasing hardware on an accelerated timetable is wild.
6022991	6023752	But we look forward to that.
6024132	6024292	Yeah.
6025012	6027774	Alright, well with that, we're going to do some final thoughts and wrap it up.
6027814	6030015	Thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6030055	6033097	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6033698	6041783	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube or wherever you found this show going an awful long way.
6041863	6042403	Tell a friend.
6042963	6043724	Help us spread the word.
6043764	6044865	We need more voices here.
6044945	6045685	Thank you so much.
6046886	6047847	Let's get the final thoughts.
6047947	6051409	I'm assuming you are... We're done nice and early tonight, Jamie, so I'm assuming you're streaming tonight.
6052503	6052963	Yeah, I am.
6053164	6053704	Okay.
6054425	6055886	Yeah, I'm going to do some Dead by Daylight.
6055926	6056887	I might do some Killer.
6056907	6057608	We'll see what happens.
6057988	6058208	Fun.
6058608	6059129	Anything goes.
6059509	6059850	Have fun.
6061011	6062712	Oh, final thought.
6062812	6063193	Final thought.
6064354	6064534	Ow.
6065334	6065895	Okay, feel better.
6066435	6070379	Doing three ballet classes effectively a week is kind of owie.
6072441	6072761	Bye.
6072921	6073222	Bye-bye.
6074883	6076885	Loki, your final thought for us tonight.
6078221	6086246	My final thought is I am excited to get this Retroid Pocket Flip 2 fully ready to go.
6087107	6088428	Setting up emulators is hard.
6090928	6094271	My final thought is... Oh, real quick, I was going to say, sorry.
6095172	6102458	One disappointing thing, though, is I probably will not be able to get the dream of playing Final Fantasy XI offline on that thing.
6102959	6105461	It's just, it's so complicated to do it.
6105702	6107743	Like, it's so incredibly complicated.
6108044	6112468	And now with the servers being shut down and everything, good luck getting your system updates.
6112808	6114530	Like, how do you do that?
6115311	6115651	I don't know.
6116052	6117632	Can you do the desktop one easier?
6117872	6118593	Because I'll do that.
6118753	6120693	Yeah, it would be the desktop version.
6120733	6121873	It would be the PC version.
6121913	6123654	So emulating the PC version.
6124274	6135196	But it's hard to find a modded launcher that isn't specifically made for just one server.
6135856	6137777	Something that is available for everything.
6138997	6139557	They're not.
6141138	6141558	I don't know.
6141658	6142718	It's very complicated.
6143186	6151247	Alright, well, Square just needs to release a Final Fantasy XI new version that's playable offline already, but they probably won't.
6151507	6155528	Let's see, my final thought is Claire Obscure, Expedition 33, I'm coming for you this week, finally.
6155888	6157308	It's taken me way too long to get to.
6158409	6163549	But also, I had such a good time in LA this last couple days.
6164070	6169851	I think, you know, I was talking this through with my friend Victoria, who I used to do a podcast with, and one of these days I'd love to do a podcast with her again.
6170291	6172071	And I was like, I think, I think
6172851	6179216	Alan and I went so hard on Disney for so many years that it kind of ruined the SoCal trips for us for a while.
6179296	6180437	Or we burned out.
6180457	6181117	I shouldn't say ruined.
6181137	6181798	We burned out.
6181978	6183239	Nothing was wrong, per se.
6183279	6183900	It just got expensive.
6183920	6185481	We just got burned out doing other stuff.
6185501	6189684	But now that we got to go this last week, I'm definitely going to come to LA more often.
6190405	6191986	Maybe I'll go to the Game Awards finally this year.
6192026	6193167	We'll see.
6194748	6195749	Also, I love Kylie Minogue.
6196229	6196809	She's incredible.
6197450	6198271	Stan Kylie Minogue.
6198571	6199772	She's unproblematic and fun.
6200072	6200953	Have a good night, everybody.
6200993	6201173	Bye.
