1
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:21,124
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not known yet what the Xbox button will do, but Microsoft is expected to add features like Xbox Game Bar, Play Anywhere functionality, and Game Pass Ultimate.

2
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:25,028
[SPEAKER_00]: It could go even deeper, possibly launching the Xbox app on Windows, according to video cards.

3
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:33,634
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true, it is not known yet, but if you've ever used an Xbox or even an Xbox controller on Windows, you can probably figure out 90% of what the button will do or logically lead to.

4
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:40,478
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Fluffy Paragraph, and now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this FCC filing and the rest of the week's gaming news.

5
00:00:40,718 --> 00:00:42,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting right now on the show, wherever gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:51,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:54,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:54,213 --> 00:01:01,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back once again tonight, May the 11th, 2025, episode number 1046 of our program.

10
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:09,503
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, of course, here live to talk about video games, the week in gaming news, gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, all that good stuff.

11
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:10,804
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

12
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with you every week with my co-host.

13
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:16,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

15
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.

16
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,049
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

17
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask later.

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

19
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're looking forward to the pinball show next week.

20
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:26,734
[SPEAKER_06]: You and I were talking about that a little bit earlier.

21
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, ooh, maybe I can actually go this year.

22
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:30,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I always wanted to go.

23
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:31,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.

24
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:40,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to figure out how to make ballet rehearsal work on Sunday because I do not know that dance and I kind of don't want to.

25
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:42,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me doesn't want to do it, but I committed.

26
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinball's always pretty fun.

27
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Those machines are calling your name.

28
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:47,207
[SPEAKER_06]: But I get it.

29
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:47,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

30
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard when you say like, oh yeah, I'm going to do this thing.

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to stay true to it and all that good stuff.

32
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:53,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

33
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:59,219
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of it, I think it's just outside of my skill level.

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm having just that.

35
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of feel like I've asked for help and I'm not really getting it.

36
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:07,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is what it is.

37
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,928
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,120
[SPEAKER_06]: are doing incredible tonight.

39
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:39,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the folks that identify as a mother in whatever way that is, I hope you all are having a wonderful Mother's Day.

40
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes Mother Monster, Lady Gaga.

41
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:44,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wish Lady Gaga a very happy Mother's Day as well.

42
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll get right into the gaming news.

43
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:55,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to mention, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at The Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

44
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

45
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,473
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Twitch channel to follow and where we actually broadcast live.

46
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:11,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are on the air right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, who was on tonight and passed on his technical fail issues to us tonight because we're on take number three.

47
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:11,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, things happen.

48
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:13,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into game news.

49
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:15,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start off with this tonight.

50
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:18,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about a story from Nintendo.

51
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:27,492
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Nintendo has been very, I'll say aggressive when it comes to the legal things around, right?

52
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:39,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Something we're not talking about tonight on this show roll, but was also in the news was about how PalWorld has confirmed that they made adjustments to their game based on some of the things that happened in the Nintendo lawsuit.

53
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:39,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,602
[SPEAKER_06]: and I don't know if they're ultimately trying to settle out of court or what's going on there, but I digress.

55
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:50,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that Nintendo has always been a pretty litigious company, especially out of the big three.

56
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:57,506
[SPEAKER_06]: One could also argue they have some of the biggest intellectual properties out there to protect.

57
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:04,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I say as I sit here and I'm wearing a Bowser hat and DarkSakura's VTuber is on a Super Metroid inspired background, right?

58
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo creates... I can change it.

59
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:08,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

60
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:31,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Astrobot, Sackboy.

61
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:38,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there are some family, but, you know, put Astrobot and Sackboy side by side with Mario, Link, Samus.

62
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's still a different level of, I think, especially if you have to look past your...

63
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:47,899
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

64
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:17,356
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody under the age of 50 that's played, at least in America, Europe, Japan, one of the companies that has a Nintendo distribution.

65
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:20,777
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be hard-pressed to find somebody under 50 that's never played those games.

66
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:25,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, The Last of Us and even Astro Boy, you name it.

67
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:27,479
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

68
00:05:46,066 --> 00:06:01,076
[SPEAKER_06]: My point is that Nintendo somewhat, I believe, acts overly litigious because of the strength of their IPs that we're now seeing leveraged in movies as well with the Mario movie and soon to be a Zelda movie that they really have to protect.

69
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,398
[SPEAKER_06]: But certainly a lot of that goes to the games as well.

70
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:06,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a little bit controversial.

71
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:07,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new change in the Nintendo user agreement.

73
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:20,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you updated the Switch firmware on your Nintendo Switch or you pretty much tried to do anything involving your Nintendo account, you're going to need to accept the new user agreement.

74
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:31,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, this new user agreement, if we want to just cut all the fluff out, we're going to say it's going to break your Switch if it's found with pirated games or mods.

75
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:45,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So some folks actually dug through and found that Nintendo said you should not, quote, bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo account services.

76
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,031
[SPEAKER_06]: If you adapt, reverse engineer, or modify a Nintendo user account, that was in the previous agreement.

77
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:54,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this new one is in place.

78
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,934
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do break those rules, Nintendo can, quote,

79
00:06:58,155 --> 00:07:03,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable or whole or in part.

80
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So if... That has nothing to do with playing anything on your own computer.

81
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,361
[SPEAKER_06]: No, your computer would be different.

82
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:10,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is piracy on your device.

83
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:17,726
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that is because, yeah, Nintendo can't really force you to accept a license agreement on your PC.

84
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:23,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of, I mean, if you visit their website maybe, but otherwise, and yeah, they wouldn't have access to break your computer.

85
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,170
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're right.

86
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't stop piracy on...

87
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:37,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say I have a great new Dolphin emulator that lets me play F-Zero GX in 4K, even better looking than the GameCube had it.

88
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:39,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo kind of can't stop that.

89
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:46,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, legally, if I was making a profit on YouTube with videos of it, they could go after me.

90
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,042
[SPEAKER_06]: They could go after that front with copyright claiming my videos.

91
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:55,565
[SPEAKER_06]: If I was a ROM site distributing those F-Zero GX, they could go after me there.

92
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:56,445
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:31,256
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using your Switch and you've modded it to sideload games, play pirated games, I don't know if they have a way to hack the Nintendo Switch Online library with more games.

94
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's a thing, but who knows.

95
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,342
[SPEAKER_02]: People figure stuff out.

96
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:37,442
[SPEAKER_06]: People do figure stuff out.

97
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:40,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And Nintendo is basically saying they have the right to break your device.

98
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I will say, and I'll admit I did it.

99
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it long after its life cycle.

100
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:52,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But I went back and modded my Wii console, the Nintendo Wii, to check out the Homebrew channel.

101
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:56,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was well before all the recent allegations against what's going on in the Homebrew channel.

102
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it play Just Dance ABBA?

103
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,090
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually, legitimately, yes.

104
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't believe they released that game here.

105
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:03,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there for that.

106
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:05,731
[SPEAKER_04]: TRO was there for that.

107
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,431
[SPEAKER_06]: You were.

108
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:09,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that game was only released in Europe.

109
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:12,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was actually a big reason why I modded the Wii.

110
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,354
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I've always been very anti-region locking.

111
00:09:15,794 --> 00:09:22,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was like, alright, well if they don't want me to be able to play this legitimately, then I'm just going to open up the Wii and play it that way.

112
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that brought the Homebrew channel and all the other stuff with it.

113
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:26,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

114
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:33,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did mod the Nintendo Wii, but did that stop me from spending dollars at Nintendo?

115
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:33,618
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

116
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Have I still supported... Did I still buy a Wii U?

117
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

118
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

119
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:54,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize it gets into a gray area when we talk about the ethics and all that good stuff, but I don't feel any particular moral sense of lesser because I modded my Wii well after...

120
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: or well towards the end of the Wii's life cycle when the Wii U is about to come out.

121
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,988
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100 Matt, that's a good point.

122
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:05,373
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100 Matt says, I think some folks hacked their Wii to play President Cat.

123
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, maybe we did have some impact.

124
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:12,057
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:40,731
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

126
00:11:04,636 --> 00:11:05,337
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

127
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: and Skateboard Down the Streets of the City or whatever were the minigames in that thing, which I think was one of those.

128
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:43,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, PodCulture says, now you have Stray and Little Kitty Big City.

129
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,816
[SPEAKER_06]: We here at Orange Lawns Radio, we're just ahead of our time.

130
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:50,634
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just a stray.

131
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:51,836
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome for stray.

132
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:52,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take credit for that.

133
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:53,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

134
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:53,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

135
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:54,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

136
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:55,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

137
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

138
00:11:57,501 --> 00:11:58,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that, DJ Ranma.

139
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:04,848
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S in chat says, ZenkaiCon 2008 actually had President Cat in the game room.

140
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,514
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're going to look me dead ass in the eye and say that that game didn't sell any copies.

141
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to dead ass look me in the eye and say that game didn't sell any copies.

142
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's where piracy got the game over here in the US.

143
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,661
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was never endorsed.

144
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:21,562
[SPEAKER_06]: That was never the point.

145
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:25,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The point was to get that game released in the US, which unfortunately never happened.

146
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:29,149
[SPEAKER_06]: But we did get the attention of the nice social media staff on Twitter.

147
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember those back when Twitter was fun.

148
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what's going on here, but thank you.

149
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that response.

150
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:37,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We have no idea why this is happening, but thank you.

151
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:40,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when Twitter was fun.

152
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember those days?

153
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, boy.

154
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: No, back when Twitter was.

155
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:45,824
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, too.

156
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:46,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when Twitter was.

157
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:48,546
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

158
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:48,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

159
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:53,685
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that Nintendo has always had a very strong anti-piracy stance.

160
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:59,107
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know what happened about Yuzu and when Nintendo has gone after them.

161
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,788
[SPEAKER_06]: There was Ryu Jinx and all this stuff.

162
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo really tries to whack-a-mole with these emulators as they come up and so forth.

163
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:11,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say I'm surprised to see it, to be honest.

164
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:16,056
[SPEAKER_06]: My concern is what's going to happen when somebody hits a false positive?

165
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:17,956
[SPEAKER_06]: You just know that's coming.

166
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:26,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's system is going to get bricked and cue the 90 minute YouTube they're going to make that says Nintendo illegally banned me.

167
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo illegally banned me.

168
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the list of all the things I never did wrong.

169
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:38,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it will come out like three years later that they did indeed sideload something and just didn't think they'd get caught.

170
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:40,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, in...

171
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:46,491
[SPEAKER_06]: In fairness, there could be the false flag that comes out somewhere because we don't know how this detection system is going to work.

172
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:46,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt that.

173
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt that.

174
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:50,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of doubt it too.

175
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:56,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what Nintendo needs is, because here's what I worry about.

176
00:13:57,805 --> 00:14:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times today you'll hear that people get banned from, I don't know, Pokemon Go or EA Online or whatever.

177
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,854
[SPEAKER_06]: People get banned and they have like no recourse to figure out why they were banned or how to appeal that ban.

178
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:15,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Because companies don't like to share the reason why people were banned.

179
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm assuming that's because, I don't know, they don't want other people to... I don't know what the reason is or thought behind it, but they don't like to share those types of things.

180
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:26,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So my concern is...

181
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:41,392
[SPEAKER_06]: If, and I'm with you, Jamie, that I don't think this is going to happen, but if it happens even once to somebody who didn't deserve it, that person has the right to be able to go to Nintendo and say, you brick this shit when you shouldn't have, unbrick it.

182
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And there should be that process set up.

183
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:48,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just know, I already know, I already know, that's not going to be a thing.

184
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:49,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be a thing.

185
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's not going to have a system set up like that.

186
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:55,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I guess that would mean cue the lawsuit eventually.

187
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they want to have their ass handed to them at some point.

188
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But even so, there's not going to be any recourse.

189
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, complain all you want on the internet.

190
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:04,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo will give a shit.

191
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:07,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or talk to our AI support bot.

192
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,786
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be the recourse.

193
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:15,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk to our AI support bot who will just keep parroting the same, like, five... Have you turned it off and on again?

194
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:19,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do me a favor.

195
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:22,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn it off again and wait for 30 seconds and then turn it on again.

196
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,968
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S says if they brick it, there's a way to recover.

197
00:15:29,288 --> 00:15:42,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's another thing I'm curious about is wouldn't the piracy community and we'll say the hacking modding community, wouldn't they be the ones to come up with a here's how to unbrick your switch?

198
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've been bricked.

199
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:45,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's how to unbrick it.

200
00:15:47,754 --> 00:15:48,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, hold on.

201
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:49,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

202
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:58,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly think all it's going to be is that you just have to go through a system restore that removes any sideloaded whatever.

203
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Your account gets restored.

204
00:15:59,621 --> 00:16:00,121
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

205
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a factory reset by pushing different buttons?

206
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:04,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

207
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to do that to my Evercade when I first got it.

208
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you remember, but when I got my Evercade... I mean, any device can be factory reset.

209
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:11,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

210
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:16,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can do that to any phone, your computer.

211
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,405
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's got an OS on it, it can be restored.

212
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:25,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that Nintendo could go the lengths of like the Mac address of the device banning it from online?

213
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:28,239
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if you did factory reset it, you can't do anything with it?

214
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:29,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Offline?

215
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's going to be necessary.

216
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And besides that, there's ways around that too.

217
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

218
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:35,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

219
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:38,288
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

220
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, Ranchan, there are ways around a boot loop.

221
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:48,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel like it's a giant game of chess between Nintendo and the hacking and piracy communities.

222
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to make clear, I don't endorse piracy of new games.

223
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I think games that are no longer available at retail, there ought to be some sort of way to preserve those games.

224
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:02,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we need to kind of find that medium as an industry with that.

225
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,255
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't support the piracy of current games.

226
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:10,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do understand the desire of, hey, someday

227
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:22,236
[SPEAKER_06]: someday Nintendo is going to pull the Switch store just like they did the Wii store and just like they did the Wii U store but I will still want to be able to experience the games of that time especially the ones that I own so

228
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we'll see legally how this goes and what systems actually get bricked.

229
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be watching this.

230
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:34,568
[SPEAKER_02]: There may just not even be anything to worry about.

231
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:35,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

232
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it's in the end-user license agreement doesn't mean Nintendo's going to do it.

233
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:49,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means they want that ability to do it, although an end-user license agreement has, I don't believe, ever been...

234
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Looked at in court.

235
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Because these things always settle.

236
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:57,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's funny, we kind of say, I think Nintendo could have a court case coming.

237
00:17:57,649 --> 00:17:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Would they or would they just settle?

238
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what always happens is they settle.

239
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Be very interesting.

240
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:03,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very interesting.

241
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,551
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

242
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:13,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, ethically and sourced by a store or otherwise.

243
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,773
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've just been...

244
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:39,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, playing from some dark dungeon where I have like 50,000 old CRT monitors from all the systems I've been hacking through time I want to visit this dark dungeon, that sounds fucking rad Ironically, I think there is a game called Dark Dungeon You don't want to go there But, I mean, I played, speaking of dark dungeons, I've been playing Dead by Daylight

245
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:47,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, kind of having a, I don't know, I'm getting kind of tired of DBD.

246
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:51,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I know blasphemy, blasphemy, blasphemy.

247
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you interested?

248
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's in our show role.

249
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:56,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you interested in anything that they announced at their anniversary update?

250
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they did their big meeting.

251
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested.

252
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninth anniversary, because they finally unveiled Springtrap, right?

253
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:02,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Springtrap.

254
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:03,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

255
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got, what's his face from the movie?

256
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:06,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Matthew Lillard.

257
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:07,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

258
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:08,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the voice.

259
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:08,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

260
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:08,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

261
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:10,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That was more interesting.

262
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just doing the voice.

263
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:14,650
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the face in motion capture.

264
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

265
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,891
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a skin that actually has him.

266
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:17,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

267
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

268
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:25,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they left a teaser for

269
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:33,688
[SPEAKER_02]: for what one of the upcoming killer chapters is, and they figured what it is, and then I promptly forgot what it was.

270
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:39,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to say that Polyester said something about it.

271
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:44,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, they kept making some fun jabs at him because he was there.

272
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to look at

273
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I like some of the cosmetic stuff coming out there's

274
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,050
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be some very interesting things happening.

275
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the Witcher stuff that's happening.

276
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:12,013
[SPEAKER_06]: The Boulay Brothers artist skin is fire.

277
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:14,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like what they did with that.

278
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:14,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, it is.

279
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:16,996
[SPEAKER_02]: The Huntress, I could take her, you know, take her leave.

280
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:26,842
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's, I'm pretty, pretty, pretty, I'm happy about it.

281
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:28,043
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't get me wrong.

282
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:57,012
[SPEAKER_02]: but at the same time I'm also just like I really want to see what they're doing to fix some of the things oh yeah so the thing is Walking Dead oh that makes so much sense though they've been talking about that forever when I say they I mean the community rumors have been buzzing about that forever they did some he sang something at the end hmm

283
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:04,647
[SPEAKER_02]: and so that they've left hints in the event.

284
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:06,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

285
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:08,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it would be Negan who's the killer?

286
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The speculation is Walking Dead.

287
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:10,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

288
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

289
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:20,958
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm pretty... I don't know.

290
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:24,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say at least the haystacking was kept.

291
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

292
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question about the Dragula thing.

293
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw some of the highlights on social media, but I didn't watch the whole presentation.

294
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:35,563
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I watched the Boulay brothers reveal.

295
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:36,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched that whole thing.

296
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:41,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they ever credit Asia Consent for that Huntress outfit?

297
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:48,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm almost positive the language they were using was, as seen on the show, that we designed through our show, that this was on the show.

298
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kind of like, why aren't you saying Asia Consent?

299
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

300
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working at the same time.

301
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:53,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

302
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:54,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

303
00:21:54,728 --> 00:22:09,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have missed it, but I swear when I watched the walkback, I was going, maybe they were worried that some people wouldn't get the pun because unfortunately on the internet, they were worried that people would take the name Asia Consent a little literally.

304
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:11,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they were worried about saying the name.

305
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was a little weird that she wasn't credited, at least again, in my recollection.

306
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:17,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

307
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:18,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

308
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:18,898
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

309
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,059
[SPEAKER_06]: She made that Huntress thing for a challenge.

310
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they showed her directly.

311
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:35,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sort of half paying attention to some of that because I was trying to get work done.

312
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:36,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had it all on the side.

313
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:40,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, the drag performer's name is Asia Consent.

314
00:22:40,306 --> 00:22:41,066
[SPEAKER_06]: She's out of Portland.

315
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:41,987
[SPEAKER_06]: She's very talented.

316
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:42,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

317
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I don't think there's anything bad about the name.

318
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the problem, Jamie.

319
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:52,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Straight people.

320
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's straight people.

321
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:58,592
[SPEAKER_02]: People are too focused on fucking.

322
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything has to be about that.

323
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also consent for legal agreements.

324
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:09,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean you watching, and I don't mean you listening on the podcast feed.

325
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,491
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you're an ally, you know I don't mean you.

326
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,692
[SPEAKER_02]: They could have said it.

327
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, it's an 18-plus game.

328
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:17,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's true.

329
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, so there would have been no problem saying anything about it.

330
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:24,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You do have to be a certain age to consent to play the game.

331
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:27,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

332
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:28,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

333
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:33,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm a little hangry, so...

334
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the vibe tonight.

335
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:38,420
[SPEAKER_02]: There's chicken.

336
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, chicken.

337
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:42,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

338
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,468
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta come here for chicken.

339
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:51,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I played some Mass Effect.

340
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Got through the Noveria mission.

341
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:54,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't take Liara.

342
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,296
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time I haven't taken Liara to Noveria.

343
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:01,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I started off with her and then I was like, oh wait, I need someone who can hack.

344
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't use Ashley that much.

345
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought Ashley and Tali and I was like, oh wait, this is why I bring Liara.

346
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:32,343
[SPEAKER_02]: and I usually want to punch Ashley in the face on that mission even though I always kill Caden because he's Captain Cardboard and I like Ashley better in the later games because she overcomes her xenophobia and you never find that out if you don't let her live

347
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:33,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice.

348
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a lot more personal development as a character than Caden does.

349
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just facts.

350
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,582
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of stays the same person he is.

351
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:46,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And she actually grows out of her xenophobia, which I really enjoy seeing.

352
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And you find out more about her family and all this.

353
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:53,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that's why I choose to let her live.

354
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:54,828
[SPEAKER_02]: That and honestly...

355
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:57,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit of a mood.

356
00:24:57,453 --> 00:24:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

357
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:25,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

358
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:38,792
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never figure out what it was about him that just aggravated me until it finally just dawned on me in the middle of trying to explain it to somebody else last night that I just don't think he's got an engaging personality.

359
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:44,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, my husband only has him tattooed on himself, so I don't have any strong feelings or anything.

360
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:46,637
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, though...

361
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:54,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have zero attraction to him as a character, so I'm a little bit biased that way.

362
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:57,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

363
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:18,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played some Palia I've been getting back into my modding a lot for Palia and I'm working on my property and trying to save money so I can buy another property but I wouldn't use the default one because I'm trying to boundary break because there is this wall and you can see something behind the wall and I've broken that boundary once and I need to do it again

364
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: but I have to have $100,000 monies to do that I've been doing Fruit Mountain just, you know, my Mahjong game on the go just like the usual stuff

365
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:59,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I just really haven't wanted to branch out more I went back to go read the original Chilling Adventures of Sabrina comic and I need to find the rest of it It goes so much differently than this show did It's a lot darker and I'm kind of here for it Nice So, it's really good But yeah, that's it

366
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,711
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week.

367
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:10,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I've, of course, still been playing a lot of Diablo 4 because that game just gives me the serotonin boost that I desire with clicking and killing the demons.

368
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:16,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm up to Torment 2 in this season, which I thought climbing the Torment ladder was supposed to be harder this season.

369
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:17,014
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

370
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:44,762
[SPEAKER_06]: But even even in their builds, I do find things where I'm like, this doesn't add up or I feel like this was not changed from a previous draft where maybe their line of thinking about what skills they should take.

371
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:49,344
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't want to get too far in the weeds on it, but even sometimes and that's fine.

372
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:52,926
[SPEAKER_06]: That site prints a ton of builds and they're always updating.

373
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:53,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a read.

374
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, I always like to kind of go, yes, I'll use this as a blueprint, but I'll challenge the thinking.

375
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I'll be like,

376
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure I logically get that, so I want to try doing this instead.

377
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:06,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me try this out in a nightmare dungeon and see if I clear it faster.

378
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll do little things like that.

379
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:13,247
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love that their site sets a blueprint and gives me an idea which direction to go.

380
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's lots of sites just like it.

381
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Icy Veins is one I've used in the past too, and there's lots of other sites.

382
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:32,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm playing a necromancer this season and I'm doing a minion build, which is basically it's very similar to in Diablo 3 when you would have the witch doctors minion build that would just the minions would kill everything on the screen and you only have to focus on bosses and big things.

383
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,541
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, very, very similar to that ultimately in execution how it plays.

384
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,902
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm having a fun time with it.

385
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just it's just so fun tearing through all the monsters.

386
00:28:40,763 --> 00:29:09,105
[SPEAKER_06]: but I did play one other game this week very important that I finally mentioned that I got to Claire Obscure Expedition 33 finally started playing that this week and I threatened last week on the show I said I know I'm overdue because this game's been out for two weeks it's right up my alley but just with all the traveling I've been doing stuff yeah it's um it's it she is that bitch that's French that's that's my uh that's my summary of Claire Claire Obscure she is that bitch I've been watching Nick play

387
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:11,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a lot of streamers playing that right now.

388
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:13,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Including Nick, yeah.

389
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:14,519
[SPEAKER_02]: With a baguette.

390
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,601
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's great.

391
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It's incredibly engrossing from the beginning.

392
00:29:21,204 --> 00:29:23,987
[SPEAKER_06]: The prologue is very, like, wow.

393
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just kind of pulls you in.

394
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:32,334
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a sequence of events happens shortly after the prologue where I was just like, am I watching the movie up?

395
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:34,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't anybody warn me about this?

396
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:36,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus Christ.

397
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,639
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

398
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:11,360
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are one of those people that was like Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon were underrated fucking Xbox games, those games deserve better.

399
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Those games always deserved a sequel.

400
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,403
[SPEAKER_06]: This game just got served up to you on a platter.

401
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:18,284
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it.

402
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: This is it, folks.

403
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:20,725
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the game you've been waiting for.

404
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:21,625
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

405
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:36,883
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

406
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:10,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the website to kind of start to read it and I instantly had spoiled for me who all the playable characters were.

407
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:12,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, you know what?

408
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have known better.

409
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my bad.

410
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to do that in the future.

411
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:19,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I'm playing on easy mode.

412
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:20,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So how bad can I fuck it up?

413
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,014
[SPEAKER_06]: How bad can I fuck it up?

414
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:22,934
[SPEAKER_02]: This is interesting.

415
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:23,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

416
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:28,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I already own Dead Cells and there is a two-piece bundle.

417
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:32,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually just get the game for like five bucks cheaper online.

418
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:32,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

419
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:35,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're not a Game Pass person.

420
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I'm doing it.

421
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:38,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Pass.

422
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:39,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the outfits.

423
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a Mac.

424
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:42,348
[SPEAKER_06]: The outfits are a nothing burger.

425
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:43,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't worry about it.

426
00:31:43,749 --> 00:31:47,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I shouldn't say a nothing burger, but it's a single player game.

427
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:53,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people have actually said from equipping the outfits, it takes them out of the experience.

428
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say very early on in the game, I don't think this is going to ruin anything.

429
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's during the prologue.

430
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:02,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually found an area.

431
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you didn't find this, hunt around a little more.

432
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a little hidden area where I battled a mime.

433
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:12,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in defeating the mime, I got an outfit that's like a mime outfit.

434
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:13,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

435
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:13,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

436
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:13,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

437
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and I will say I do love the hairstyles that I did.

438
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:39,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I did change the main character's hairstyle very soon.

439
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:43,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, SGO100Matt says this game is a love letter to JRPGs.

440
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:51,508
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is a love letter to games like I and this game is going I don't know because again, I feel like we said the same thing about Baldur's Gate 3.

441
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:53,649
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:14,529
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

443
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: it holds its fucking own against those series even in the brief bits I've experienced so far and I know I've just scratched the surface but it is itching all of those same it is scratching all of those same itches that a Final Fantasy game scratches so I I don't see how this game does not win game of the year because this game is such a fucking disruptor

444
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:03,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby in chat says, I'm struggling with the dodges and the parries.

445
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,099
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be playing on easy mode.

446
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:08,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you, Bobby Blackwolf.

447
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:12,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It does make the timing a lot easier from what I understand, but it is tight.

448
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,362
[SPEAKER_06]: The parries are tight.

449
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say if you can't do the parries, focus on the dodges first.

450
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:23,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way the dodges, you start to... It's kind of like...

451
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:36,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how when you see a Final Fantasy monster enough times, you go, oh, this is a zombie, I know from prior experience, they're weak to cures, they're weak to fire, so if I use those spells on the zombies, I'll get through them.

452
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:37,610
[SPEAKER_06]: You sort of learn those things.

453
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar with their attacks.

454
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:49,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there's one mob early on in the game that says, this mob does a fast attack, and then this mob does a slow attack, and based on what it's telling you,

455
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:57,616
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the exact same animation every time, and as you start to see it, you start to learn how to dodge it.

456
00:34:57,936 --> 00:35:04,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But I fucking love how you can start the fight by aiming your gun and shooting a weak point for massive damage.

457
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,298
[SPEAKER_06]: The flourish in this game is incredible, and obviously it looks great.

458
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:11,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure many of you have seen screenshots.

459
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:11,379
[SPEAKER_06]: This game...

460
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,721
[SPEAKER_06]: She is that bitch.

461
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,383
[SPEAKER_06]: She is that girl.

462
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:17,604
[SPEAKER_06]: All the hype.

463
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for a reason, y'all.

464
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:25,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's somebody out there that's going to be like, eh, I don't like that.

465
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:26,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

466
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

467
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:28,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, she's different.

468
00:35:28,897 --> 00:35:29,418
[SPEAKER_06]: We get it.

469
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:34,628
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the game industry as a whole, this game is pretty fucking incredible.

470
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:42,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very interested to see what type of ripple effect this is going to have on the industry.

471
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:48,277
[SPEAKER_06]: My understanding is this story was already optioned for a movie.

472
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:58,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody got an inside presentation on this and scooped up those movie rights because they're smart, because the story's

473
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:00,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, even early on.

474
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also hear the story can be very triggering.

475
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:06,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw that on Blue Sky today, is that there's actually some issues.

476
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some pretty intense stuff, I guess, in the game.

477
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:14,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know enough about the story, but it can be pretty overwhelming.

478
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:21,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does seem like the type of thing that would serve itself very well as either a movie or a TV show.

479
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody snatched those rights up.

480
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is going to be out there.

481
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:30,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, S2100Matt says Charlie Cox is the main character voice who played Daredevil.

482
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:34,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Ben Starr also plays a major character who I don't think I've gotten to yet.

483
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I love... What's that second character's name?

484
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Lume?

485
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:38,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Luna?

486
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:42,472
[SPEAKER_06]: She is like hot.

487
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just gonna say it.

488
00:36:43,112 --> 00:36:43,633
[SPEAKER_06]: She's hot.

489
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:48,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like... I was pretty sure I heard Jennifer English when I was watching Nick play.

490
00:36:48,314 --> 00:36:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Mmm.

491
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:52,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, yeah, great characters.

492
00:36:53,454 --> 00:37:00,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if you like RPGs, I'm assuming you are already playing this game.

493
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:09,118
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just going to tell you, if you've been holding off, if you like these RPGs, these types of games, go fucking play this game.

494
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really that good.

495
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,099
[SPEAKER_06]: However, now I'm going to tell you my one complaint.

496
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say 10 out of 10.

497
00:37:17,524 --> 00:37:18,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to say 9.9 out of 10.

498
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one major fucking complaint with this game.

499
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:22,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to guess?

500
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:24,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to guess?

501
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:25,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to guess?

502
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you, Mike.

503
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:28,128
[SPEAKER_06]: One complaint with the game.

504
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:30,728
[SPEAKER_06]: No fucking maps.

505
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know.

506
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:34,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the interview.

507
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:40,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the interviews where they said they made the choice to do it for whatever editorial reason.

508
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:40,292
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

509
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:49,749
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times have we been told we don't want something, but really we do?

510
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, isn't the mere existence of Claire Obscure a whole response to Square Enix saying you don't want a turn-based game with modern graphics?

511
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:03,465
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm telling you, yes, we want fucking maps.

512
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:05,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest.

513
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I just have a problem with spatial awareness or spatiality.

514
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually see the lack of maps

515
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:18,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say it as an accessibility issue.

516
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the lack of maps is an accessibility issue.

517
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think having maps is going to make your game more accessible.

518
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know some of you out there are going to say, well, then draw your own map.

519
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:30,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, princess, we're not on the days.

520
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:30,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to mod.

521
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,834
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on the, yes, yes.

522
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a map mod.

523
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:35,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that, oh, yes to that.

524
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's, because here's the thing.

525
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not in two dimensions anymore, sweetie.

526
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:47,501
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't map things on graph paper like we used to do in Metroid and Kid Icarus Dungeons and stuff like that.

527
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: We're past those days.

528
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Doom broke that in 1995.

529
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:52,825
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in 3D now, honey.

530
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:57,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't just draw my own map.

531
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:01,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and it looks like some folks in chat agree with me.

532
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Mish says, thank you, that's my only gripe.

533
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream says, yes.

534
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:08,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the lack of maps is ridiculous.

535
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:12,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And whatever their editorial reason is for it, they are wrong.

536
00:39:14,558 --> 00:39:18,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So there actually is an active request right now for a map mod.

537
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:19,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

538
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the mod community does it.

539
00:39:22,783 --> 00:39:23,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I will install that, 100%.

540
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:25,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

541
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:26,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, modders.

542
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:27,687
[SPEAKER_06]: We salute you.

543
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:29,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Modder's Day.

544
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:32,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the modders out there.

545
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

546
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:36,127
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

547
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,990
[SPEAKER_06]: All the modders that have come before.

548
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

549
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:42,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

550
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:46,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Has this Joe 100 Matt say maps like the song?

551
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,595
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't love you like I love you.

552
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:50,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

553
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait on the maps.

554
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:53,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait.

555
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,442
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't love you like I love you.

556
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:55,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I love maps.

557
00:39:55,703 --> 00:39:55,964
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

558
00:39:56,024 --> 00:39:58,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, enough deep references.

559
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:00,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough Claire Obscure references.

560
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:03,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some news.

561
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we're done with our gaming week, let's get into more news.

562
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:09,031
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about Nintendo.

563
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about Microsoft and Xbox.

564
00:40:12,132 --> 00:40:12,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaks.

565
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:13,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We got them.

566
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:16,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a new Microsoft leak.

567
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what the Microsoft X-branded handheld is going to look like.

568
00:40:22,574 --> 00:40:26,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually an Asus ROG Alley 2 handheld.

569
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:30,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are going to be the things that are Xbox branded if these leaks are to be believed.

570
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:34,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're literally looking at a piece of hardware in these leaks.

571
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:40,261
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a very hard thing to dispute, and I think this is very a where there's smoke, there's fire situation.

572
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,363
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the Xbox handhelds have been rumored for a long time.

573
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Why wouldn't this be the type of thing to announce during the Keelyverse, whether it's this summer or this winter?

574
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I think probably this summer would make a lot of sense.

575
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So an Xbox-branded gaming console seems to be on the way.

576
00:40:57,452 --> 00:41:00,894
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there are some specs for this.

577
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:03,676
[SPEAKER_06]: They have 7-inch 120Hz displays.

578
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:18,404
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox version of the ROG Ally 2, because there's two different versions of this, so the Xbox-branded version will have an AMD 8-core 36W Ryzen Z2 Extreme and 64GB of LPDDR5X memory.

579
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the regular specs are different, we'll say that.

580
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:46,000
[SPEAKER_06]: so um the Xbox branded one looks to have just a little bit more oomph there uh but we see that there's an Xbox button and so we assume that Microsoft will add in things like the Xbox game bar play anywhere functionality which could be huge um playing games through the cloud on this portable device especially from your own Xbox like lying in bed tapping into the Xbox downstairs on this thing could be very interesting um

581
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we'll have to wait and see what all the details really are, but we know this is coming.

582
00:41:53,205 --> 00:42:03,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seemed like between the Switch 2s, the Steam Decks of the world, it doesn't surprise me that Microsoft wants to get into this space too.

583
00:42:04,193 --> 00:42:09,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Rinmari68k in chat says, okay, but I'd like to know how long the battery can last.

584
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:10,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Valid question.

585
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have run eight C-cells.

586
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:14,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a Game Gear.

587
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:18,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like three-fourths of the way to Game Gear was the batteries.

588
00:42:20,342 --> 00:42:24,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But even the Steam Deck, I feel, runs through battery charge real fast.

589
00:42:24,105 --> 00:42:26,286
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, it depends on what you're playing, right?

590
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:33,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Tetris the Grandmaster, not a game – and I love that game – but not a game that's pushing the graphics card to its extreme, right?

591
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas –

592
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:39,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Claire Obscure, I guess we'll say, might be a game that's going to push the limit a little more.

593
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:41,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So the battery life is going to depend on what you play in.

594
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:43,191
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a big part of that.

595
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:48,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, yeah, I think an Xbox handheld could be really neat.

596
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:51,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we need all of those handhelds.

597
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:58,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Like personally, do I need a Steam Deck and a Switch 2 and a mobile phone and an Xbox?

598
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:04,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I need that, but let's see what the case is that Microsoft's going to make on why I need to have one of those.

599
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make phone calls too?

600
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it an N-Gage?

601
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a Taco?

602
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:09,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the Xbox N-Gage?

603
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:11,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, we don't need any of them.

604
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dear lord, I'm so glad I got out of this game.

605
00:43:42,830 --> 00:44:02,718
[SPEAKER_02]: in the 90s and sold all of my cards and got a lot of money for them same and that's no shade my wallet is celebrating all my black bordered cards my moxes my dual lands my legends y'all know I'm talking about magic the moment I bring up you know the alphas the betas the reserves all those legends

606
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they have unveiled new Magic the Gathering and Final Fantasy cards.

607
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, these are pretty.

608
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:19,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I would buy them other than that they're pretty.

609
00:44:21,247 --> 00:44:27,231
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are some new cards being added in for the Final Fantasy series.

610
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:39,478
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got like Vivi, Cloud, we have Bahamut Summon, we have Zanarkand, we have Vanille, Squall, Tifa, Renoir, Lightning, I mean like so many.

611
00:44:39,518 --> 00:44:47,804
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Kayn, we have Furion, the Rose Warrior, we have, you know, one of the Sids, Cecil,

612
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:52,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaos, like just so many things.

613
00:44:53,844 --> 00:45:00,294
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to have some special mechanics to go along with those play styles.

614
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

615
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:04,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

616
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:11,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as a Final Fantasy fan, I look at this and I go, oh, I have to have the Balthier and Fran card.

617
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:15,637
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I'm like, ooh, I should get back into Magic the Gathering.

618
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:22,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I hear my wallet screaming at me going, don't you even fucking think about it, you stupid capitalist bitch.

619
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not fall for this stuff.

620
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:27,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to pretend I never saw any of this.

621
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:38,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I do think it's... I really like the artwork they did for Terra's card because it's a mono art.

622
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:44,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it's still magic and I'm not gonna... I know.

623
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:47,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I still almost want to get the cards just to have in one of those display cases.

624
00:45:48,347 --> 00:45:49,248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like baseball cards.

625
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:50,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never use them for anything.

626
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:51,490
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they get you, Rob.

627
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

628
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:53,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It is, it is.

629
00:45:55,387 --> 00:46:11,776
[SPEAKER_06]: and then yeah my wallet will be like how dare you can't you just stick to the free Pokemon cards and the trading card pocket which by the way I finally fell off that game I'm sorry if I stopped sending you cheers or whatever they are in those I finally fell off that game I haven't opened it in months so sorry but yeah

630
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I never got on it, so I'm not losing anything.

631
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:19,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for the best.

632
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

633
00:46:21,636 --> 00:46:31,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to something we can all get on board with, and that is our game developers forming unions for their rights and their protections.

634
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:35,523
[SPEAKER_06]: And the developers behind the popular video game Overwatch...

635
00:46:36,483 --> 00:46:38,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Overwatch 2 still or Overwatch?

636
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I noticed the media is just calling it Overwatch again.

637
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:42,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I digress.

638
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:46,588
[SPEAKER_06]: The developers behind the Overwatch franchise have unionized.

639
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:52,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Activision Blizzard Overwatch team made a union under the CWA.

640
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:54,812
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Communication Workers of America.

641
00:46:55,293 --> 00:46:59,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It is recognized by parent company Microsoft, which to be fair, Microsoft...

642
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:00,795
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

643
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:38,533
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, in the CWA's announcement on Friday, quote, a neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal.

644
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:45,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions.

645
00:47:46,177 --> 00:47:47,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

646
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully this means, you know, they'll...

647
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:53,838
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

648
00:48:12,714 --> 00:48:13,074
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

649
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:52,776
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back to something that we're into, and that is seeing the old stuff come back, right?

650
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:55,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always dealing with it.

651
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,680
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that there was the attempt to try to bring back Echo the Dolphin?

652
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Kickstarter that kind of failed pretty bad.

653
00:49:05,924 --> 00:49:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But Echo the Dolphin is getting a remaster, and not just the first game, but also Tides of Time is getting a remaster.

654
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:15,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a note about a new

655
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:17,710
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

656
00:49:32,025 --> 00:49:54,274
[SPEAKER_02]: he said me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Echo the Dolphin and Ties of Times game then we will make a third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities and then he linked a brand new website with a countdown scheduled to end on April 25th, 2026 so there you go we'll see what happens

657
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:59,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I find SSJ100Matt's comment in chat highly relatable, saying, I never beat Echo.

658
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:02,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just rent it and swim around most of the time.

659
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:02,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

660
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, at a recent little gamer gathering with friends, Echo the Dolphin got brought up and played a little bit.

661
00:50:12,116 --> 00:50:14,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, dang, this game was hard.

662
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:17,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for a game about a fucking dolphin, this game is hard.

663
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as, you know, a lot of games of that era were.

664
00:50:20,404 --> 00:50:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: It was freaking gorgeous.

665
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

666
00:50:21,945 --> 00:50:22,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, it's gorgeous.

667
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:25,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, everything is about memorizing the patterns at the end of the day.

668
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:27,050
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a hard game.

669
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:27,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

670
00:50:28,803 --> 00:50:29,083
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

671
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:30,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's talk about the Switch 2.

672
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:33,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting that we're already talking about sales.

673
00:50:33,744 --> 00:50:34,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

674
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:36,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I found this story to be a little bit weird.

675
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:36,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to be honest.

676
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:37,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to explain why.

677
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:46,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently Nintendo, I guess, may be revising some of their sales estimates on this.

678
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:56,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the latest earnings report, they projected that 15 million Switch 2 units would be sold in its first year through March 2026.

679
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:59,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So its first fiscal year, if you will.

680
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:04,675
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's lower than what the analysts were predicting was 16.8 million.

681
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:12,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's being blamed for this is, well, it's a little bit inferred, but it's all this uncertainty around the tariffs.

682
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:13,098
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

683
00:51:37,065 --> 00:51:38,606
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

684
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:55,382
[SPEAKER_06]: pre-orders.

685
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:58,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So we already know how many are selling through the viewers because it's, it's been limited.

686
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:12,154
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been capped, but I guess where it gets, you know, a little muddy is how many switch twos are there really going to be able to bring over here to the States between now, you know, what's already here and the holiday season.

687
00:52:12,475 --> 00:52:22,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can understand that that's, what's maybe muddying the waters and lowering this prediction because already less boats are coming over here because of this whole ridiculous tariff situation.

688
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:23,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So interesting.

689
00:52:24,544 --> 00:52:24,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

690
00:52:25,886 --> 00:52:38,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they are saying in Japan, the company received 2.2 million applications for pre-orders and Nintendo said that far exceeds their expectations.

691
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,064
[SPEAKER_06]: But Shintaro Furukawa did say that U.S.

692
00:52:43,104 --> 00:52:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: tariffs are one area the company does not have control over.

693
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:57,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Furukawa did say that Nintendo's current policy is to recognize the tariffs as a cost, but if additional tariffs necessitate a price increase in the U.S., then demand in the country is going to fall.

694
00:52:58,326 --> 00:53:06,668
[SPEAKER_06]: The rising prices of daily expenses and food could also have an impact on what, you know, like Jamie said earlier, you don't need games.

695
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:10,509
[SPEAKER_06]: You need food, you need water, but you don't need games.

696
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:14,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And that turns into a lot of difficult household decisions for people.

697
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are expecting 45 million Switch 2 games to be sold through the financial year.

698
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:29,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want to put things in comparison, 150 million Switch consoles have been sold to date, and that was 17.79 million in the first 13 months.

699
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:40,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Switch 2 is on a similar pace, but we'll see how this tariff situation fucks everything up.

700
00:53:41,987 --> 00:53:52,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranmari68 says, I can't wait to pay an extra $70 for my Gradius Origins Japanese version, but at least it will arrive in August instead of 2027 or whatever.

701
00:53:52,818 --> 00:53:56,421
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's coming from Japan, it isn't going to be 145% or whatever.

702
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:57,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only, I think, 10%.

703
00:53:58,183 --> 00:53:58,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be high.

704
00:53:59,124 --> 00:54:01,286
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't make any sense of this bullshit anymore.

705
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:04,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect anyone to be able to, but I don't think it's that high.

706
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,271
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

707
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:31,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Bobby does point out it depends if you get the game from Japan or Hong Kong.

708
00:54:31,757 --> 00:54:32,237
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

709
00:54:32,277 --> 00:54:34,278
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of game distributors in Hong Kong.

710
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:35,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for reminding me.

711
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:37,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And they make their game from Japan.

712
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:39,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it goes to Hong Kong.

713
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it comes here.

714
00:54:40,301 --> 00:54:42,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, and PlayAsia is stationed in Hong Kong.

715
00:54:42,902 --> 00:54:43,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for reminding me.

716
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:44,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot about that.

717
00:54:45,103 --> 00:54:47,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So yep, then you would have to pay the extra money.

718
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or do they still have those elaborate services where you can get something like shipped to a locker in Japan and then they'll ship what's in the locker to you?

719
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:56,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Rakuten, I think.

720
00:54:56,368 --> 00:54:58,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I thought that was a thing.

721
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:58,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of those.

722
00:54:59,029 --> 00:54:59,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

723
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still shopper sites.

724
00:55:01,269 --> 00:55:01,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

725
00:55:02,209 --> 00:55:06,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe one of your close friends is planning on moving to Japan in a few months and can do all this shit for you.

726
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:07,710
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

727
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:09,591
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

728
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:17,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's go back to a simpler time where the only tariff you had to pay was 25 cents per game.

729
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:19,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to this segment.

730
00:55:19,913 --> 00:55:21,373
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a tariff, Rob.

731
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:24,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's not, but forgive my transitions.

732
00:55:34,952 --> 00:55:42,235
[SPEAKER_01]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

733
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:45,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

734
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:57,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And once a month for 2025, DarkSakura likes to pick a arcade or excuse me, a game that started as a video game but is now in the arcade.

735
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura, what is... A console game.

736
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:00,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what is the... That goes to the arcade.

737
00:56:00,682 --> 00:56:04,123
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the console classic game to arcade of the month?

738
00:56:05,267 --> 00:56:05,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris.

739
00:56:06,771 --> 00:56:09,899
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one I forgot went that path.

740
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,002
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, that's great.

741
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:11,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

742
00:56:11,363 --> 00:56:11,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us more.

743
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:17,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Tetris in its original conceptions was a PC game.

744
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:27,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and of course there were all sorts of other variants, like even a version that you could play on a TI-83 graphic calculator, which I have.

745
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:36,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is a game that has a Guinness World Record for the most ported game.

746
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:38,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Video game of all time.

747
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,608
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, yeah.

748
00:56:42,468 --> 00:56:58,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had had all kinds of home versions for different computers, including the Amstrad systems, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple II, BBC Micro Acorn, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, you know, IBM PCs, MS-DOS, Mac OS, PC 9800, X68000.

749
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could keep going.

750
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a Famicom version.

751
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:25,536
[SPEAKER_02]: of course we had but it wasn't you know we had all of these releases by the way that record was awarded in 2017 and the official versions are about 220 over 65 different platforms so yeah

752
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:43,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, going back, I mean, we had the very original Spectrum Holobite version that was released January 27th, 1988.

753
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:54,220
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first arcade version, there was one that came out, it was Sega's version, in December 1988.

754
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Japan, it was the highest grossing game of 1989.

755
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stayed in the highest grossing arcade conversion kits through 1995.

756
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:18,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this also led to, um, the, uh, there was a Mega Drive version being developed by, um, Sanri Tsudenki, and it was cancelled.

757
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they printed less than 10 copies.

758
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:39,474
[SPEAKER_02]: but they actually did end up releasing a new version of it that came out on the Sega Genesis Mini so there's that and then of course there were other arcade versions that were released there was the Atari games version in 1988 as well and

759
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:52,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving into later on, this just opened the door for us having all sorts of arcade versions.

760
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:53,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in 1995, we had Tetris Plus.

761
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had Tetris Plus 2 in 87.

762
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:08,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Going further into Tetris the Grandmaster in 1998, 10 years after that original release.

763
00:59:10,495 --> 00:59:16,578
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a version... Oh my god, I kind of remember that there was a Sony Ericsson version in 1999.

764
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:21,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm just going through all the various arcade versions.

765
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,221
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Tetris the Absolute, the Grandmaster 2 in 2000.

766
00:59:23,261 --> 00:59:23,541
[SPEAKER_02]: We had...

767
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:29,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, there's the version I had on my phone.

768
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Sony Ericsson T68M.

769
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:34,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember that phone.

770
00:59:36,044 --> 00:59:40,727
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 2005 Tetris the Grandmaster 3 Terror Instinct.

771
00:59:41,468 --> 00:59:47,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, I'm looking for another, the N-Gage version, Arcade Tetris Giant.

772
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:48,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We've played that one.

773
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:50,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's the one that used to have a golf land.

774
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:51,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:59:51,774 --> 00:59:52,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

776
00:59:54,161 --> 01:00:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: there was uh hold on I'm looking for another arcade one um

777
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:10,652
[SPEAKER_06]: The video you have playing of the OG arcade Tetris, the Atari one, I'm watching this going, fuck, I missed this version of the game.

778
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:13,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally want to fire up MAME and play this after the show.

779
01:00:13,854 --> 01:00:16,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm like, oh man, this version of Tetris was so good.

780
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:19,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the way it was styled was just neat.

781
01:00:20,397 --> 01:00:20,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

782
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I get that it's all about Grandmaster and these newfangled Tetris now, but I have a special place in my heart for these oldies.

783
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:58,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm laughing because there's an unofficial one called TERTIS T-E-R-T-I-S in 1991 for the Acorn Archimedes published by SICK just sick published by sick so yeah but back to it though I mean we have had a number of arcade releases and so it does count for home console games that have been ported to arcades

784
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,320
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it absolutely counts.

785
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:10,963
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I was originally reading you picking this pick, I was just like, yeah, like, you know, this game, I mean, technically it was originally, originally, like my brain goes, oh, it was originally a Game Boy game.

786
01:01:10,983 --> 01:01:11,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, no, it wasn't.

787
01:01:11,904 --> 01:01:15,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It was originally, originally that Russian terminal system that didn't even exist here.

788
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:16,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's where the creator made it.

789
01:01:17,285 --> 01:01:19,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I played Tetris forever.

790
01:01:19,186 --> 01:01:19,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that...

791
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm up on it now.

792
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I watched that four-hour documentary, okay?

793
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:25,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try me.

794
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:33,114
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, in all seriousness, like, you know, now it's, you know, you see the different divergent paths of Tetris, right?

795
01:01:33,214 --> 01:01:39,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And the versions that people consider to be, like, the biblical versions of Tetris, the definitive versions of Tetris.

796
01:01:40,058 --> 01:01:41,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some people, that's the Game Boy version.

797
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:43,160
[SPEAKER_06]: For some people, that's the NES version.

798
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, when my people were crossing the desert, the only thing they had to stay amused with was Tetris.

799
01:01:49,144 --> 01:01:49,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

800
01:01:49,944 --> 01:01:51,325
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

801
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: and how that all works that kind of just makes the strategy in that game a little bit different and like it makes Tetris a very different experience between something like that which is rooted in the arcade and something like let's say Tetris Effect which is like obviously an extremely modern console version of Tetris that in in many ways is is definitive in and of itself so the fun thing going back into this is all of this started from woodblock puzzles

802
01:02:41,772 --> 01:02:43,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

803
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:46,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I love doing freaking woodblock puzzles for the record.

804
01:02:46,814 --> 01:02:56,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you did the long documentary, but Tetris Forever is really, really worth a playthrough or watch through, whatever you want to call it.

805
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:01,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You see him working on a wood puzzle while he's talking about how the wood puzzles inspired Tetris.

806
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool.

807
01:03:02,402 --> 01:03:02,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

808
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:10,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've got all kinds of apps that are just like, you know, the wood puzzle apps.

809
01:03:10,097 --> 01:03:12,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to fill the whole screen with the pieces that you have.

810
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:15,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are so much fun to me.

811
01:03:15,181 --> 01:03:17,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tetris, you know, I used to do this when I was a kid.

812
01:03:17,903 --> 01:03:21,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that was really my first attraction to Tetris.

813
01:03:22,046 --> 01:03:25,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this person is making mistakes in this video.

814
01:03:26,189 --> 01:03:27,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long play video.

815
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:27,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

816
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:29,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Choices were made.

817
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Choices were made.

818
01:03:30,532 --> 01:03:31,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was a great choice.

819
01:03:32,403 --> 01:04:01,095
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, well thank you but no, I love me some Tetris and to this day maybe I'm not like I don't really enjoy the Grandmaster games that much but I enjoy the classic NES Tetris because once I get started I don't stop it's just like that I'm the same way with Dr. Mario if I have a gradual build up to it I just don't stop until I'm just bored

820
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:06,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Rinmari in chat... Oh, go ahead.

821
01:04:07,988 --> 01:04:09,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

822
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:15,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Rinmari in chat says, any Tetris game where a piece is instant lock, like the Nintendo and Atari versions, I can't really go back to, lol.

823
01:04:15,832 --> 01:04:16,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that.

824
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:22,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's even hard to play without the hold feature now that's present in modern Tetris games.

825
01:04:22,515 --> 01:04:23,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all are spoiled.

826
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:27,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think about what I would consider the definitive Tetris to be.

827
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:31,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be the one that was on the Russian workstation.

828
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, well, or to you, I guess, or whatever that is.

829
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:39,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for me, I consider the Game Boy version the definitive edition.

830
01:04:39,144 --> 01:04:46,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But I completely understand that it's different for everybody and that the play styles are different.

831
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:56,937
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you what, if Tetris Plus on the PlayStation 1 by Jaleco is your definitive version of Tetris, something is wrong with you because that version sucked ass.

832
01:04:58,618 --> 01:04:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on God.

833
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

834
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:09,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably, I mean, well, to me, I would probably say just given that it was the Famicom one that I grew up with.

835
01:05:10,518 --> 01:05:15,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, truly, you know, if I was going to be honest, I'd say the Game Boy version because I stole my mom's.

836
01:05:16,424 --> 01:05:23,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always was a big fan of like Blastress for a hot minute when we had our Super Scope.

837
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:47,467
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm gonna go on record right now saying that one of the emotional attachments I have in Tetris is fucking Tetranet oh fucking Tetranet core memory unlocked no T that's that's all of us on dial up on AO fucking L going hey you wanna play Tetranet yeah let's play Tetranet

838
01:05:48,832 --> 01:05:54,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, maybe it was intended, but don't forget that Famicom and NES actually were different Tetrises.

839
01:05:54,876 --> 01:05:59,299
[SPEAKER_06]: The Famicom version was much different because it had to do – and Tetris Forever gets into this.

840
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because – Remember I had my friend that had – Oh, yeah.

841
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:04,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

842
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:06,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

843
01:06:06,604 --> 01:06:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people out there may not know without seeing the documentaries and stuff behind it that there really was a different version in Japan of Tetris than there was in the US.

844
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a cartridge.

845
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:21,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a Tetris 2 cartridge.

846
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:26,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember how to play Tetris 2.

847
01:06:27,556 --> 01:06:27,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

848
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a Famicom cartridge.

849
01:06:31,457 --> 01:06:34,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people are going to say, no, you're wrong.

850
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:34,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

851
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:35,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

852
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:37,660
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, Dr. Mario is Tetris 2.

853
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:43,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think because it was the most logical feeling.

854
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:43,383
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

855
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:46,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I love freaking Dr. Mario.

856
01:06:46,459 --> 01:06:46,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too.

857
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But that had nothing, that was nothing Tetris-y to me.

858
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:58,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but it was, well, for me, it was that same like look and feel of the pieces falling into the well, but it was like a different concept, you know?

859
01:06:58,421 --> 01:06:58,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

860
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:00,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but like, think about this.

861
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:02,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Columns had that.

862
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:04,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Puyo Puyo had that.

863
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:05,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate Columns.

864
01:07:05,143 --> 01:07:06,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all that preview.

865
01:07:06,503 --> 01:07:08,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Columns is a terrible game, I'm sorry.

866
01:07:08,483 --> 01:07:09,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm throwing it out there.

867
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it, I get it.

868
01:07:10,104 --> 01:07:11,584
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Yoshi's Cookie.

869
01:07:13,038 --> 01:07:27,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Twinkle Star Sprites like all of those games that had Puzzle Fighter I do love Puzzle Fighter I do love Puzzle Fighter there's enough of a tweak in mechanics Puzzle Fighter is just P.O.P.O.

870
01:07:27,856 --> 01:07:31,361
[SPEAKER_02]: on incredible colorful crack I love P.O.P.O.

871
01:07:31,973 --> 01:07:37,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna say the other game that I can't stand in retrospect, and this game was everywhere.

872
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,923
[SPEAKER_06]: People sure have sentimental attachments to it, but Klax.

873
01:07:41,364 --> 01:07:42,305
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awful.

874
01:07:42,748 --> 01:07:43,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Klax.

875
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:47,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand how you're supposed to be successful in that game.

876
01:07:47,249 --> 01:07:52,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play Klax when there was nothing else because it was always on free play at the roller rink.

877
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:52,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

878
01:07:53,391 --> 01:07:57,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Klax is one of those games where I'll play it once and I'll be like, this game is fucking terrible.

879
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:58,452
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you supposed to get good at this game?

880
01:07:58,472 --> 01:07:59,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd never play it again.

881
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Klax is the game that you play to remind yourself of how bad Klax is.

882
01:08:02,394 --> 01:08:04,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, that part.

883
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:06,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

884
01:08:06,895 --> 01:08:07,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

885
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,360
[SPEAKER_06]: But there were a lot of bad Tetris.

886
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:18,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and... And also, if you use the Type-C music on NES Tetris, there's a special place in hell for you.

887
01:08:18,742 --> 01:08:26,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just, like, maybe why I feel the way I do about Dr. Mario is that all of, like, the official Tetris sequels are just, like, non-starters to me.

888
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:33,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm sorry, and I know people are going to disagree, and that's fine, but to me, Tetris 2, didn't care for it.

889
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:34,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Hat-triss, bad.

890
01:08:35,005 --> 01:08:36,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Face-triss, bad.

891
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:37,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Word-triss...

892
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:40,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, but not great.

893
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:44,034
[SPEAKER_02]: But Blastress was, though, just kind of fun, I have to say.

894
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:45,154
[SPEAKER_06]: God, what was the other one?

895
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Hatress, Facetress, they were just all bad.

896
01:08:49,055 --> 01:08:49,876
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them were good.

897
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:52,836
[SPEAKER_06]: But, anyway.

898
01:08:53,757 --> 01:08:58,658
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of liked, we liked the Bombtress, though, that was pretty fun.

899
01:08:58,818 --> 01:09:00,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster says, where am I faced?

900
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Tetris Battle Gaiden?

901
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:03,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

902
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:03,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

903
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:06,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fun one.

904
01:09:06,661 --> 01:09:08,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's in Tetris Forever.

905
01:09:09,204 --> 01:09:11,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Questmaster says, where are my face-tress people at?

906
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Out back by the dumpster trying to find your game.

907
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:25,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Bonds 006 says, does anyone else see Tetris falling in their sleep?

908
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:26,201
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I guess it's just me.

909
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the whole thing.

910
01:09:27,703 --> 01:09:29,685
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that original Tetris Effect trailer?

911
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:34,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and watch the Tetris Effect trailer.

912
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really one of the best trailers they ever did.

913
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:40,955
[SPEAKER_06]: S200 Matt says, we're drawing lines in the sand tonight on OLR.

914
01:09:40,995 --> 01:09:41,596
[SPEAKER_06]: We sure are.

915
01:09:41,796 --> 01:09:42,296
[SPEAKER_06]: We sure are.

916
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:43,938
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

917
01:09:45,003 --> 01:09:46,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on.

918
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:49,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about a couple other quick items in rapid fire news.

919
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:52,032
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

920
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:54,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I gotta?

921
01:09:54,614 --> 01:09:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I gotta.

922
01:09:56,494 --> 01:10:02,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ACNEO Geo Selection Volume 5 and 6 has been announced for Switch.

[SPEAKER_02]: I want them both, because both have things I want.

930
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:46,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, I mean, if I really wanted to play Last Blade 2, I could just bust out my Dreamcast.

931
01:10:47,634 --> 01:11:11,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say bust out my Neo Geo and my fat fucking cartridge okay given that I have a Neo Geo and a bunch of fat fucking cartridges I do not have Last Blade 2 and I would give somebody else's right arm for it maybe their left arm too and a couple of their metatarsals what's your foot bones?

932
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:14,072
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

933
01:11:14,212 --> 01:11:21,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those sound like really impressive collections because I have not... Yeah, I don't know why this is ACA, but... Oh, Arcade Archives.

934
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:21,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I guessed.

935
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:23,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Arcade Archives.

936
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:23,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

937
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was like, what?

938
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: The Affordable Care Act making video games?

939
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:27,723
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Arcade Archives.

940
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:55,131
[SPEAKER_06]: um but yeah well and you can get those piecemeal I'm pretty sure today but I have to admit I don't follow the arcade archive series week to week so it's only when these big massive collections come out that I go oh oh shit I need to get in on that they release some good shit on that platform I keep forgetting like the original Tetris Grandmaster came out on arcade archives at some point so it's like something I kind of want to go revisit now that I've been playing four I do play four on my steam deck I really enjoy it so

941
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,909
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

942
01:12:22,179 --> 01:12:24,280
[SPEAKER_02]: If you delude yourself long enough, you eventually believe it.

943
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:30,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So a small development, I guess, in this particular story that happened.

944
01:12:30,941 --> 01:12:34,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The translator response in full is the following.

945
01:12:35,763 --> 01:12:37,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I want to do something.

946
01:12:37,503 --> 01:12:40,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, Dragon Quest has seen three, one, and two remakes.

947
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:41,825
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

948
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:00,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuji Horii sees you and wishes you'd stop calling.

949
01:13:01,047 --> 01:13:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

950
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:05,029
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's a possibility for sure, but we'll see.

951
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to find out a little later how you all feel about remakes with not our Fugle Question of the Week, but kind of a newer thing we're doing during the Listener Roundtable.

952
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:22,839
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we need to travel around and check out some release dates of some games coming out real soon.

[SPEAKER_06]: That's a stacked fucking collection, let me tell you.

987
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still tempted to wait until it goes on sale, but we'll see.

988
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:19,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I know my friend will pick it up right away, and I'm like, I can go play it at his house, but we'll see.

989
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's the release dates from around the world.

990
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:28,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Some folks in chat, Mike Def says, I'm getting that collection on launch for Switch.

991
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:31,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't blame y'all.

992
01:16:32,044 --> 01:16:33,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Def says, may pick it up for Steam too.

993
01:16:33,925 --> 01:16:35,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, the double dipping!

994
01:16:35,848 --> 01:16:41,630
[SPEAKER_06]: The Double Dippy, remember when y'all made fun of me for like quadruple dipping on Mass Effect 3?

995
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:43,451
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

996
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:52,134
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Wii U. I had the fucking Wii U version of Mass Effect 3.

997
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:54,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the one that bought it on sale.

998
01:16:54,455 --> 01:16:56,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But I modded mine to shit and back.

999
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:01,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember your old, whatever happened to your old Tumblr?

1000
01:17:03,533 --> 01:17:03,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still there.

1001
01:17:04,193 --> 01:17:06,194
[SPEAKER_02]: MassAffecting.tumblr.com Yeah.

1002
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard Tumblr was like in a renaissance thing right now.

1003
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:13,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually thinking about revi- what, what, what?

1004
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:15,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because I misspelled it.

1005
01:17:16,819 --> 01:17:20,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A. MassAffecting.

1006
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,321
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1007
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking A. I was about to freak the fuck out.

1008
01:17:24,322 --> 01:17:25,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, yeah.

1009
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:26,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.

1010
01:17:29,104 --> 01:17:30,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Last post set October 30th, 2023.

1011
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was about Silent Hill.

1012
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:35,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

1013
01:17:35,535 --> 01:17:35,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

1014
01:17:35,895 --> 01:17:38,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But you had an N7 post in 2019.

1015
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:39,896
[SPEAKER_06]: So, good times.

1016
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:40,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1017
01:17:40,817 --> 01:17:43,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I still have like over 10,000 followers on it for some reason.

1018
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

1019
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:46,218
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1020
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1021
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe it's time to bring it back.

1022
01:17:48,379 --> 01:17:48,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1023
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:51,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go to a place where we don't have 10,000 followers.

1024
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 160 about.

1025
01:17:53,781 --> 01:17:54,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, hey, I'll take it.

1026
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:55,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take it.

1027
01:17:55,321 --> 01:18:02,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our Blue Sky over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com because we are verified by... We need to play like a MIDI version of Mr. Blue Sky for this segment.

1028
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:07,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

1029
01:18:07,886 --> 01:18:13,227
[SPEAKER_06]: We're verified by domain over on Blue Sky, so you can follow us at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1030
01:18:14,268 --> 01:18:21,770
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked a fun question this week that I want to get to, which is, for tonight's show, what's your take on video game remakes?

1031
01:18:23,050 --> 01:18:24,331
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of hullabaloo.

1032
01:18:25,071 --> 01:18:26,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that I was able to use that name today.

1033
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:31,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Around a potential Chrono Trigger remake, as I talked about during Rapid Fire News.

1034
01:18:31,715 --> 01:18:35,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want to see this or a classic that you love remade at all?

1035
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:38,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are these classics best remembered as only a classic?

1036
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:40,180
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people definitely feel this way about a lot of movies.

1037
01:18:41,441 --> 01:18:43,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was curious what you all think about games.

1038
01:18:43,442 --> 01:18:47,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like to see these remakes or do you get a little irritated when you hear about this stuff?

1039
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:48,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go through some of the answers.

1040
01:18:50,690 --> 01:19:04,925
[SPEAKER_06]: 13X Forever messaged us on Blue Sky hello hello and said remakes are a great way to make old title more accessible to current audiences visuals controls gameplay accessibility societal norms everything is changing and not everything ages equally well

1041
01:19:05,586 --> 01:19:09,370
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Chrono Trigger had so many remakes, and the latest one is still fresh.

1042
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:16,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming referring to the relatively recent iPad, and I'm sure it was on Android as well, so mobile version, we'll say.

1043
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:21,082
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, give me Final Fantasy Tactics or A or A2.

1044
01:19:21,242 --> 01:19:21,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1045
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,258
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, personally, I'm all for it.

1046
01:19:25,938 --> 01:19:38,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering your options these days are either the Steam release or track down one of the previous releases of the game, which could get expensive, at least as far as OG Super Nintendo goes, I would certainly not object to a new HD 2D release on modern systems.

1047
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:40,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It worked out for Dragon Quest 3.

1048
01:19:41,307 --> 01:19:44,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to Dragon Quest 1 and 2, which I thought would have been out by now, to be honest.

1049
01:19:45,149 --> 01:19:45,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1050
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:49,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, SSJ100Matt messaged us, oh, I'm sorry, I skipped one.

1051
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:55,498
[SPEAKER_06]: DungeonBuster messaged us saying, one way I like looking at a solid remake is that they're kind of like reposts.

1052
01:19:55,899 --> 01:20:01,744
[SPEAKER_06]: They share that experience with those that might have missed out with a bit of added polish after learning something new since then.

1053
01:20:02,304 --> 01:20:03,685
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1054
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:27,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't that great, so something to think about.

1055
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:37,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, S200Matt says, I think remakes are a great way for folks of this generation of gamers to experience the classics as well as us older folk get to revisit.

1056
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: A Chrono Trigger remake done in the style of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake would be at the top of my list, but how about a Blades of Steel remake?

1057
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:48,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you need Konami originals?

1058
01:20:51,518 --> 01:21:19,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved Blades of Steel Blades of Steel and only if it has the mini version of Gradius available still at halftime or whatever they call the third breaks in hockey Critical Myth says sometimes remakes are a great opportunity to play something you missed on old hardware that is no longer easy to find or use I recently played Dragon Quest 3 Remake and I don't think I would have been able to play the game otherwise

1059
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:25,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's, you know, maybe the old school NES graphics can be a little grating at some point, so...

1060
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:34,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment replied and said, I'm all for gaming companies going through their catalogs of IPs and seeing what hasn't been used in a while.

1061
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:38,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps they could look at something that flopped and see how they could do much better.

1062
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Much like with Battlestar Galactica.

1063
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1064
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:49,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not necessarily remaking because, you know, I think a lot of this are approaching this with remaking like a legendary game or a game a lot of people remember fondly.

1065
01:21:50,474 --> 01:21:55,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But Redertainment is suggesting what about going back and redoing a game that sucked?

1066
01:21:56,056 --> 01:21:57,717
[SPEAKER_06]: and giving it the attention it deserves.

1067
01:21:58,658 --> 01:21:59,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting proposition.

1068
01:21:59,818 --> 01:22:00,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1069
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream Today says, I still fantasize, no pun intended, about getting a Final Fantasy VI remake like the one VII has been getting.

1070
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:19,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Remakes with small changes and visual updates are fun, but huge overhauls that really honor the original are great, and the original is still there to enjoy.

1071
01:22:20,031 --> 01:22:20,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You know...

1072
01:22:21,954 --> 01:22:22,795
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1073
01:22:45,089 --> 01:22:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's really like the story completely retold from the ground up.

1074
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:56,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like it's told for the stage instead of told for the screen or the novel instead of the original.

1075
01:22:56,411 --> 01:22:58,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just – it's so different to me.

1076
01:22:59,191 --> 01:23:08,673
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's weird when I – and it's not to shade the original comment because I completely understand why your brain is going there because they called that game Final Fantasy VII Remake.

1077
01:23:08,993 --> 01:23:14,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're all kind of conditioned to think, oh, when they remake a Final Fantasy game, it needs to be that in-depth.

1078
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:34,331
[SPEAKER_06]: and I don't necessarily think that's what we're asking for a lot of these re-releases I don't know about you all that's not what I need for Chrono Trigger I would actually be worried that's how you get the bad remakes that was referenced in an earlier post is by changing the things that people really loved I don't know that's my opinion

1079
01:23:36,609 --> 01:23:37,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Mish.

1080
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:46,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Mishkins, who says, I wouldn't mind a remake, but I feel like at this point it'll run us $100 if it did happen.

1081
01:23:46,596 --> 01:23:49,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, little tongue-in-cheek, but you're not incorrect.

1082
01:23:49,177 --> 01:23:49,938
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not incorrect.

1083
01:23:50,918 --> 01:23:55,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Bryguy replies to us on Blue Sky saying, I'd like to see a Star Fox Adventure remake.

1084
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Need more Tricky in my life.

1085
01:23:58,383 --> 01:24:00,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we just need Star Fox to make a comeback.

1086
01:24:01,047 --> 01:24:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we do.

1087
01:24:01,608 --> 01:24:05,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's all cross our fingers and toes and find our favorite effigy.

1088
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But do a barrel roll.

1089
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's all do a barrel roll.

1090
01:24:08,237 --> 01:24:08,558
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1091
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Do a barrel roll to get Star Fox on Switch 2.

1092
01:24:11,021 --> 01:24:11,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1093
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:13,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1094
01:24:14,004 --> 01:24:18,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Coral Rose on Blue Sky responds to us saying, Game budgets are unsustainable.

1095
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,568
[SPEAKER_06]: The financial risk is killing companies and jobs.

1096
01:24:22,028 --> 01:24:24,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Remaking older games is a good middle ground.

1097
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:31,113
[SPEAKER_06]: They're smaller, they're known quantities, and they can revive a franchise or get a niche game the audience it deserves.

1098
01:24:31,853 --> 01:24:34,374
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, Vagrant Story and the Xena Saga games.

1099
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:41,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a really realistic take on, and this is the case for Hollywood as well,

1100
01:24:43,087 --> 01:24:47,270
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people bitch about the remakes and the retellings and why do we have to do these shows again?

1101
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's been shown that people will tend to watch them.

1102
01:24:51,897 --> 01:24:54,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I do feel like some of the damn is starting to break on that.

1103
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:57,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Like not every revival has been doing fantastically.

1104
01:24:58,118 --> 01:25:02,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Night Court remake just got canceled after three seasons, but it still lasted three seasons.

1105
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:05,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And even I went, it was on more than one.

1106
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,180
[SPEAKER_06]: That's surprising.

1107
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:12,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And in games, I think that's, you know, we talk about $80 from this giant team to do this.

1108
01:25:12,361 --> 01:25:12,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1109
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:18,482
[SPEAKER_06]: A remake is something much smaller in scope that they can probably put out at a more affordable price.

1110
01:25:20,765 --> 01:25:21,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to think about.

1111
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I think remakes are unavoidable for those reasons, as Coral points out.

1112
01:25:26,769 --> 01:25:30,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuzzerhop on Blue Sky says, I think it all depends on how playable the game is.

1113
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:36,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Some games might just need a graphical update, or others just need bug fixes or a faster sale.

1114
01:25:36,836 --> 01:25:40,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to determine which games need more fixing and which games don't.

1115
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:43,100
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all a matter of opinion, really.

1116
01:25:44,101 --> 01:25:47,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading Fuzzerhop's reply going, if they did an E.T.

1117
01:25:47,463 --> 01:25:47,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Atari 2600 remake...

1118
01:25:51,594 --> 01:26:05,412
[SPEAKER_06]: the instruction manual would be built in this time so you would know how to play the game besides just playing it up on a ROM going this is terrible you would know that what was it game 4 was actually the beginner mode of the game that helps you get used to the mechanics and all that other stuff

1119
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:07,255
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkDetsuya said,

1120
01:26:25,356 --> 01:26:33,681
[SPEAKER_06]: On the President Cat Talk, I saw a YouTuber I watch regularly find a copy of the game in one of those retro game shops over in Japan.

1121
01:26:34,141 --> 01:26:35,582
[SPEAKER_06]: They were asking 65,780 yen.

1122
01:26:35,622 --> 01:26:36,483
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about $450.

1123
01:26:36,523 --> 01:26:37,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it became quite the collector's item.

1124
01:26:38,044 --> 01:26:38,344
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1125
01:26:52,059 --> 01:26:53,119
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1126
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it would be worth $450 open, but he could probably still get a pretty penny for it.

1127
01:27:26,253 --> 01:27:26,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me.

1128
01:27:28,134 --> 01:27:29,035
[SPEAKER_06]: That is so wild.

1129
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:31,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question, Dr. Zia.

1130
01:27:31,557 --> 01:27:33,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the YouTuber call it President Cat?

1131
01:27:35,619 --> 01:27:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it has nothing to do with being an actual president.

1132
01:27:38,381 --> 01:27:39,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a company president.

1133
01:27:39,842 --> 01:27:45,847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know, but that's the tell on if it was something they got from us or if they actually translated the real name.

1134
01:27:45,867 --> 01:27:46,287
[SPEAKER_02]: They got it from us.

1135
01:27:46,547 --> 01:27:48,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if they call it President Cat.

1136
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1137
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:50,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Dr. Cia says no.

1138
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:51,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That came from us.

1139
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:52,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1140
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:54,552
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1141
01:27:55,132 --> 01:27:55,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1142
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:58,293
[SPEAKER_02]: You were the ones who called that game President Cat to start.

1143
01:27:58,394 --> 01:28:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because you were talking about that loose translation.

1144
01:28:02,775 --> 01:28:04,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I said, done.

1145
01:28:04,756 --> 01:28:05,476
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need a reason.

1146
01:28:05,516 --> 01:28:06,237
[SPEAKER_06]: President Cat.

1147
01:28:06,257 --> 01:28:07,317
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great fucking idea.

1148
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:08,037
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the president.

1149
01:28:08,057 --> 01:28:09,218
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the president of the company.

1150
01:28:09,938 --> 01:28:10,839
[SPEAKER_06]: What a great name that is.

1151
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:12,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just fucking ran with it.

1152
01:28:12,519 --> 01:28:13,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I was saying it's like...

1153
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:18,417
[SPEAKER_02]: The Leader or President and it's a delinquent girl, you know.

1154
01:28:18,697 --> 01:28:21,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't, CEO Cat doesn't have the same ring to it, you know.

1155
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:23,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1156
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more, I can buy and sell this company.

1157
01:28:28,482 --> 01:28:28,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1158
01:28:29,662 --> 01:28:35,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway, DarkSakura, I don't think we had anything in the mailbox, but I'll check rather than assume.

1159
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:35,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1160
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:38,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can always send us emails.

1161
01:28:38,406 --> 01:28:41,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send an email.

1162
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:43,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Love that.

1163
01:28:44,764 --> 01:28:45,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, that's it.

1164
01:28:45,725 --> 01:28:50,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I don't have any last-minute stories, and I doubt you do either, DarkSakura, so this is it.

1165
01:28:51,007 --> 01:28:52,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing Dead by Daylight.

1166
01:28:52,108 --> 01:28:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thoughts.

1167
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:53,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I blame you.

1168
01:28:53,589 --> 01:28:54,369
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you playing tonight?

1169
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:56,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play Claire Obscure.

1170
01:28:57,831 --> 01:29:00,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, okay, okay.

1171
01:29:00,792 --> 01:29:01,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get it started.

1172
01:29:01,913 --> 01:29:04,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play for very long because, you know, tomorrow's a work day.

1173
01:29:04,954 --> 01:29:14,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but we can see the beginning of the game, which I think a lot of people who haven't seen the beginning of the game on Twitch, and maybe if they don't have the money to pick up the game or whatever, this is great.

1174
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's a lot of reason for people to stay tuned tonight.

1175
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:17,919
[SPEAKER_02]: My channel.

1176
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:21,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my house!

1177
01:29:23,604 --> 01:29:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, DarkSakura, before we let you go, let me say, of course, as always, thank you, of course, for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio and listening to us.

1178
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:33,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1179
01:29:33,852 --> 01:29:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So please leave us a nice five-star review, a place like iTunes, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube.

1180
01:29:41,098 --> 01:29:42,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes an awful long way.

1181
01:29:42,459 --> 01:29:47,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, of course, for telling a friend about the show because we need more voices to put out on air.

1182
01:29:48,523 --> 01:29:50,085
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week in seven days.

1183
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:51,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We won't see DarkSakura.

1184
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:52,987
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be at Golden State Pinball Festival.

1185
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:54,168
[SPEAKER_06]: But have fun.

1186
01:29:54,248 --> 01:29:54,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.

1187
01:29:54,808 --> 01:29:56,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to go on Saturday.

1188
01:29:56,349 --> 01:30:00,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we have any locals that make the trek out to Lodi, I'm going to try to go on Saturday.

1189
01:30:01,373 --> 01:30:02,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I'll see you there too.

1190
01:30:02,674 --> 01:30:03,534
[SPEAKER_06]: But DarkSakura will be there.

1191
01:30:03,574 --> 01:30:04,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki will be back next week.

1192
01:30:05,296 --> 01:30:06,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have the RV.

1193
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:08,378
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be fun.

1194
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be there's going to be adventures in culinary delights that involve fire.

1195
01:30:14,416 --> 01:30:16,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there air conditioning in that RV?

1196
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:18,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there has to be.

1197
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:18,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

1198
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:19,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ours.

1199
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:19,700
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1200
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:20,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you need.

1201
01:30:21,202 --> 01:30:23,543
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S is inside the building.

1202
01:30:24,264 --> 01:30:27,687
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S is teasing in a call from Japan next Sunday.

1203
01:30:27,747 --> 01:30:30,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that might be fun because I think what this shows on like Monday morning.

1204
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:33,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to have a live listener that would like listen to us at work.

1205
01:30:34,452 --> 01:30:35,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen his name in a while.

1206
01:30:35,733 --> 01:30:36,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope he's doing well.

1207
01:30:36,554 --> 01:30:38,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But you'll be like 8 or 9 a.m.

1208
01:30:38,515 --> 01:30:39,516
[SPEAKER_06]: over there while the show's on.

1209
01:30:39,616 --> 01:30:41,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always kind of fun.

1210
01:30:41,498 --> 01:30:43,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, by all means, if you want to call in, that would be great.

1211
01:30:43,799 --> 01:30:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be a good way to do it because it's just Loki and I here next week.

1212
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:49,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll be here back by Sunday night.

1213
01:30:50,304 --> 01:30:53,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I like pinball, but not to the extent that Dan and Jamie do.

1214
01:30:53,827 --> 01:30:55,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll be there the whole time.

1215
01:30:55,308 --> 01:30:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine going for one day.

1216
01:30:56,689 --> 01:30:58,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to say if you are...

1217
01:30:59,469 --> 01:31:02,091
[SPEAKER_02]: at the show or have the ability to make it there.

1218
01:31:02,611 --> 01:31:09,476
[SPEAKER_02]: We are bringing a prototype of Multimorphic's newest table, Portal.

1219
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:11,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.

1220
01:31:11,297 --> 01:31:12,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been sitting in my garage.

1221
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:14,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

1222
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:15,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun.

1223
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:16,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to come play it.

1224
01:31:17,862 --> 01:31:18,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to.

1225
01:31:18,562 --> 01:31:19,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over.

1226
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

1227
01:31:20,524 --> 01:31:20,864
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1228
01:31:22,349 --> 01:31:27,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I will let you go so you can get your stream started and then I'll wrap it up here all by myself.

1229
01:31:27,351 --> 01:31:32,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I will wait on purpose to start the game when people are there, okay?

1230
01:31:32,573 --> 01:31:32,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1231
01:31:32,873 --> 01:31:33,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1232
01:31:33,994 --> 01:31:34,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, have a good stream.

1233
01:31:34,914 --> 01:31:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good stream, Jamie.

1234
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:37,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1235
01:31:37,835 --> 01:31:39,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And that leaves me all by myself.

1236
01:31:40,016 --> 01:31:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: All by myself.

1237
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:44,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I guess I'll put myself front and center then.

1238
01:31:45,318 --> 01:31:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.

1239
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:47,059
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just me.

1240
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody else left me.

1241
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:51,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mike Deft.

1242
01:31:51,755 --> 01:31:52,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am dancing on my own.

1243
01:31:53,036 --> 01:31:54,257
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

1244
01:31:54,297 --> 01:31:57,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the good Robin said, I'm dancing on my own.

1245
01:32:12,014 --> 01:32:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you all have a wonderful week.

1246
01:32:13,435 --> 01:32:14,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy gaming.

1247
01:32:14,235 --> 01:32:15,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm going to be playing more games this week.

1248
01:32:16,216 --> 01:32:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm going to play more Diablo 4 and no, you can't do anything about it.

1249
01:32:20,557 --> 01:32:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care of each other.

1250
01:32:21,278 --> 01:32:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great month.

1251
01:32:23,078 --> 01:32:23,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Go outside.

1252
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Go outside and take a walk.

1253
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:31,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Go on a stupid walk for your stupid mental health and you can play like Pokemon or Pikmin or Ingress or whatever tickles your fancy when you go walk.

1254
01:32:31,802 --> 01:32:32,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun, everybody.

1255
01:32:32,362 --> 01:32:32,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great week.

1256
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:33,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, everybody.

1257
01:32:36,023 --> 01:32:38,304
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1258
01:32:40,615 --> 01:32:41,276
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week.
