1
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:16,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone who knew me before about 2016 would probably agree that my being a Luddite about new popular technology is extremely atypical.

2
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:23,884
[SPEAKER_05]: For me to have literally lived technology for my entire life to be so aghast at the most recent significant uses of it is entirely unexpected.

3
00:00:24,184 --> 00:00:28,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I've come to realize that it's because tech stopped being a form of artistic design and started from principles of business.

4
00:00:28,926 --> 00:00:31,508
[SPEAKER_05]: How else could you come up with literally making up money?

5
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,802
[SPEAKER_05]: What does this have to do with gaming?

6
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

7
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:52,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:57,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again.

9
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:04,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, May the 18th of 2025 with episode number 1047 of our show.

10
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:15,259
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm not joined tonight, unfortunately, by the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but I am joined once again tonight with Techmaster Lo,

11
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:16,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Loki!

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,501
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?

14
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty good.

15
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:25,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is interesting because you were off last week, now Jamie's off this week, but how was your week off?

16
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fine.

17
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:33,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Our kids have a yearly piano recital they do, so we did that.

18
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:37,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And normally it's earlier in the day, but you know.

19
00:01:37,915 --> 00:01:38,536
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:55,314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

21
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to our chat because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

22
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mike Deft in chat says, Rob can have next week off.

23
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:30,292
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I will be here next week.

24
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But the week I will take off, let me tell you, I'm just going to tell you now.

25
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some other things going on, so we didn't get a chance, and I'll address that in a minute, but I didn't get a chance to talk about this on Bobby's show tonight, but I will be going back to Atlanta on June 22nd.

26
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:48,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is not the DragonCon trip.

27
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,974
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a second trip.

28
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing two trips to Atlanta this year because...

29
00:02:54,218 --> 00:03:20,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be going to the Southern Fried Gaming Expo once again which I went to a couple years ago and I had a lot of fun but I didn't make it back last year just because you know going to Atlanta twice a year is a lot but you know what I said let's do it let's do it again and they're kind enough to have me back and Bobby back and VOG Network is sponsoring it but we're also going to be doing a panel which we'll tell you more about later when that's all announced

30
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:21,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Deft, Deft, Deft, Deft

31
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:42,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The show itself is actually mostly the 20th and 21st, Friday and Saturday.

32
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:52,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, it runs Sunday, but like a lot of conventions that run through, the last day is kind of duncey by like 2 o'clock.

33
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:58,006
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably not the actual ending, but as far as things to do, it's dunceys by 2 o'clock.

34
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:05,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually taking a flight out on Sunday this year, which I was too afraid to do my first year, but this year I was like, nah, I'll have plenty of time to get to the airport.

35
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: and do all that stuff.

36
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm flying back on Sunday.

37
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But excited about that.

38
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:13,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bobby says it's actually earlier in the year this year.

39
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was the other big thing.

40
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:15,673
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

41
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:20,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually this show is in July and it's almost too close to DragonCon.

42
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally like six weeks apart.

43
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year it's in June because the MLB All-Star game is the normal weekend and where this hotel is is like it's

44
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,601
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little walking path that walks you over the freeway.

45
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:41,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you walk over the freeway, bam, you're at the Atlanta Braves headquarters.

46
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:46,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You're at their new stadium and the whole little shopping village and restaurant stuff that's all in that area.

47
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:54,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So this hotel is huge for that because the MLB All-Star is going to be happening over there.

48
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you don't want that to happen the same weekend.

49
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,170
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm really excited to show up.

50
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,135
[SPEAKER_02]: on that weekend.

51
00:05:01,155 --> 00:05:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Bobby says Southern Pride Game Expo is an away weekend for the Braves.

52
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:06,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of that will be getting in the way.

53
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

54
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:15,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I have to, you know, Loki, I have to plan my walking now around the freaking not Oakland A's.

55
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:19,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I walk around that stadium in West Sacramento.

56
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:20,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sutter Health Park, I think it's called.

57
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, there's a nice little river walk there.

58
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to walk down there and get all the Pokestops or Ingress or Pikmin, whatever's going on.

59
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,910
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of nice Pikmin mushrooms and stuff.

60
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I love to walk that path and around.

61
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,432
[SPEAKER_02]: The stadium being there has been great for getting a stadium Pikmin.

62
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:42,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a dessert thing right towards the front, so I get my dessert Pikmin from there.

63
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, it's a great route, except now...

64
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:45,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrible.

65
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:52,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now that the not Oakland A's are also not being called the Sacramento A's, but they're just A's.

66
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,237
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just the A's.

67
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:57,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Except if you looked at their scorecard, they'd be getting F's.

68
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,360
[SPEAKER_02]: But the A's play in that same stadium now.

69
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,562
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like parking is always a mess and people, it's just, it's a mess.

70
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:06,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mess.

71
00:06:07,143 --> 00:06:09,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't walk there as much as I used to.

72
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was nice when it lasted.

73
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,768
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the game playing behind you tonight, Loki?

74
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:22,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, of course, when we tape live at VOG, we have a fun little game that usually plays behind Loki.

75
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:27,616
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a game I used to play a bunch on the PlayStation 2.

76
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:32,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like a... Actually, no, I think this is the original PlayStation.

77
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was PlayStation 2.

78
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:34,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

79
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,385
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the PlayStations, it is called Rogue Trip Vacation 2012.

80
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:43,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a Twisted Metal type game.

81
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can tell it's very, um, like, shooty bang bang with cars, but that looks like my jam, that looks like fun.

82
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I played that, but, uh, it looks fun.

83
00:06:53,115 --> 00:07:08,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's, it's, imagine, like, god, like, yeah, it's on PlayStation 1, so imagine, like, a Twisted Metal game with, like, like, 90, like, it's not Ska, but it's, like, kind of that, like,

84
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That music that was popular around the time.

85
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:15,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That upbeat pop ska, like the one Mighty Mighty Boston song that was popular.

86
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like Mighty Mighty Boston type stuff.

87
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, imagine that as a soundtrack in that game.

88
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's kind of weird.

89
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, the premise is that you're...

90
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:35,228
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this super rich guy, I almost think of Biff Tannen in the alternate Back to the Future timeline.

91
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:47,094
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got all these big pleasure vacation spots for the ultra rich, but for everybody else, you can't access it unless you hire some of these rogue...

92
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,040
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,413
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

94
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:20,778
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

95
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could tell because when you look at controls, it's still a little picture of a PlayStation controller.

96
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:46,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, ah, it is the PlayStation versions that they put on Evercade.

97
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are actually on sale.

98
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:54,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were only – I think the cartridge – I say they because it's three in the cartridge.

99
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cartridge was only $13.

100
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,423
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big sale going on on Woot right now, which –

101
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:07,245
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time I bought something on Woot was over a decade ago because like Amazon bought them and they basically became like, you know, an arm of Amazon.

102
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:13,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody, it was going around social media that, hey, there's a big sale on Woot right now.

103
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And I peeked at one of the screenshots.

104
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, is that the Tomb Raider Evercade cartridge?

105
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,469
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, it was.

106
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:20,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only 13 bucks.

107
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hell yeah, I'm going to pick that up.

108
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always looking for deals.

109
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots and lots of t-shirts from there.

110
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's it Woot used to be like the t-shirt place and I looked you could actually see your like order history the last time I bought something from Woot was in 2013 and what I bought was that Tron mouse for the movie for Tron Legacy remember that mouse I used to have that would actually light up through the USB and make the little noises oh it was awesome that was like my favorite mouse uh

111
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

112
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to our gaming headlines, our kickoff topic, our gaming weeks, and all that good stuff.

113
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to start off with something tonight, though, that's very important.

114
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:24,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not directly gaming-related, and I have to put out a little bit of a trigger warning because, unfortunately, another member of the OL Army or our VOG Discord, our VOG fam, passed away.

115
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is extremely unexpected.

116
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,295
[SPEAKER_02]: A really good friend of the show.

117
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:38,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you and Jamie didn't know this guy so well, but you guys would have really liked him if you'd ever been able to go to DragonCon or any of that and hang out with this guy.

118
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was VO by Kurt, or Kurt was his name, but he came into chat and you probably had seen him in chat if you ever came to a live show.

119
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:50,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while he would drop in and his name was VO by Kurt and I...

120
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:51,872
[SPEAKER_02]: VoB Kurt, VoB Kurt

121
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:14,895
[SPEAKER_02]: and by the way, that was a terrible, terrible impression.

122
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:19,879
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually see his content if you want to see what he looked like and hear his voice.

123
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very good with TikTok.

124
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:29,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot about making TikTok work from him because he was one of the first people that came to the DragonCon event

125
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep wanting to say podcasting track, but digital media track that actually was mildly successful on TikTok at the time.

126
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:48,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he did is he had a channel where he called, I think his name on TikTok is still VO by Kurt, but the name that would show up was The Fat Guy.

127
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:57,151
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a larger guy for a while and he started getting in the habit of walking all the time and he started going to the gym and he would post these updates.

128
00:11:57,572 --> 00:12:02,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after 365 days a year, he lost a lot of weight.

129
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:03,515
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot.

130
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:07,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I remember seeing him at Dragon Con, you know, in more recent years after he lost the weight.

131
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:09,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what do you?

132
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,640
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to do with the fat guy?

133
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not really going to work anymore, Kurt.

134
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:16,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he rebranded as The Fit Guy.

135
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And he continued his walking adventures and so forth.

136
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:23,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had a little pocket of fans on Fitness TikTok.

137
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of them.

138
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved hearing about his stories.

139
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very motivational.

140
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:37,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I got news on Monday that he was struck by a car while he was walking.

141
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:45,429
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a whole little news report that was run on it and the driver that hit him was allegedly drunk driving.

142
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,394
[SPEAKER_02]: On a Sunday morning, mind you, um...

143
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'm going to be very restrained because I want to have a nice moment to remember Kurt but you know I have words for you.

144
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:18,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anybody out there that is of sound mind exactly endorses driving under the influence but this just goes to show that driving under the influence is a serious thing and if you have a friend that's attempting to do it or you know somebody that's done it or trying to pass it off or something like that then don't

145
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:20,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that.

146
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:26,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Bobby is saying that I'm glad I used the word alleged because Bobby is now saying it might have been a medical episode.

147
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could have been that sort of the influence.

148
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps the court documents have been sealed.

149
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:31,807
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then.

150
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that is what is the original one.

151
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:40,030
[SPEAKER_02]: The original news story I saw was lending itself more to, you know, the other situation.

152
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But fine.

153
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,511
[SPEAKER_02]: What I said is not.

154
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:45,333
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

155
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:11,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Allen and I were walking downtown playing Pikmin Bloom, getting our steps in, planting flowers, because when we walk together, we get a lot of the big flowers to hatch, which is a thing in Pikmin Blue.

156
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,789
[SPEAKER_02]: The event going on right now in Pikmin Bloom is right up my alley.

157
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:16,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's classic Nintendo controller Pikmin.

158
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:25,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time I've paid for a season pass, because I want to make sure I get all those stinking Pikmin with Nintendo controllers and Famicom controllers and Game of Watches and stuff.

159
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So Allen and I walked a good 10,000 steps downtown, and

160
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:36,982
[SPEAKER_02]: and then came home and, you know, Bobby was good enough to leave me a message that said, hey, you might want to be sitting down when you check Discord.

161
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:40,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, my mind goes to, oh, great, we're getting canceled.

162
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:41,146
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we do?

163
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:46,251
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you don't think that this is the other is going to be the case, what you're going to read.

164
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:52,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we pull up what's going on and hear that Kurt was struck by a vehicle.

165
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: while walking.

166
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really a moment of shock because literally was just doing the same thing, the same thing in a similar place that Kurt was doing on Sunday morning.

167
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:11,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kurt was a Pikmin Bloom player off and on, but he was in an on phase.

168
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,768
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd sent me what we call a mushroom.

169
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:16,449
[SPEAKER_02]: You can radio people into mushrooms.

170
00:15:16,469 --> 00:15:21,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the little thing and really, he sent me a mushroom request on Sunday morning.

171
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:46,513
[SPEAKER_02]: so I know he was playing Pikmin Bloom and so I'm just it's very very like haunted and what's what's really difficult like it's part of like all this like processing and stuff is that if you actually go and you watch his last TikTok which came up organically in my feed last night on my For You page his last TikTok came up

172
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:58,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually says in his last TikTok, he's talking, he's like, yep, I was out walking, I was getting my steps in today, walking around, and well, I actually had two cars stop and wave me by.

173
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,926
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really nice thing.

174
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:04,812
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I guess that's all I can ask for is not getting struck by a vehicle or something like that.

175
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:07,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, almost like it's like...

176
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:13,833
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult to hear, knowing what happened the next day after he recorded that.

177
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:23,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sorry if that's a little uncomfortable for people to hear, but that's a lot of the thoughts that we're sitting here processing.

178
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:32,948
[SPEAKER_02]: To hear that somebody who potentially should not have had control of a vehicle, allegedly, was behind a vehicle and...

179
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:36,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

180
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:05,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he had his own podcast about the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

181
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,161
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a co-host on the show.

182
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:12,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say it was his podcast, but him and his buddy did a show called This Week at MCU.

183
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:19,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I know Bobby already told you about this quick peek behind the curtain, but there were times we were talking about bringing that show to VOG.

184
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:23,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that also hits very, very close to home.

185
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,180
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

186
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

187
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:10,570
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

188
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:33,788
[SPEAKER_02]: and obviously Kurt's family, both biological and chosen through DragonCon are deeply in my thoughts this week.

189
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:45,552
[SPEAKER_02]: His co-host at another show that he was on called Wise and Nerdy, which I hadn't mentioned yet, but with Charles and Joe, I know they did a big show, kind of a tribute earlier this week.

190
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:51,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they're having to process too and, you know, move on.

191
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:52,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's,

192
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.

193
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:58,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I don't know what else to say.

194
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:05,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Words escape me on matters like these, but I hope Kurt's family knows that I'm thinking about them.

195
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:12,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be one of those glaring things that's missing at DragonCon this year.

196
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Kurt had missed DragonCon before.

197
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't there every year, but he was there most years that I was there.

198
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,455
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd done panels together and stuff.

199
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:24,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That absence is going to be felt this year, and it's going to be difficult.

200
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:37,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So pouring one out metaphorically for Kurt, and we'll continue my walks in his honor as the daily TikToks would have reminded me to do.

201
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:42,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's try to move on.

202
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:56,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, difficult transition, difficult topic, but we're going to move on and do what we do here, which was talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle and all of that coming to a head this week with our kickoff topic tonight.

203
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:00,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, why don't you tell us all about this thing that nobody asked for?

204
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:08,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I don't know why it's like this, but it is like this.

205
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently, in this current season of Fortnite, there is a new Darth Vader AI...

206
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:44,449
[SPEAKER_06]: A player that basically has a digital recreation of James Earl Jones' voice but it's powered by a large language model so you can interact with it via voice chat and ask it things and talk to it and do stuff and then it then responds back to you like James Earl Jones was responding back to you.

207
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,971
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is because it is a large language model

208
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, it's like two filters.

209
00:20:52,272 --> 00:20:53,213
[SPEAKER_02]: You say something.

210
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go like, you know, hello, Space Daddy.

211
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:58,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to go to chat GPT to formulate.

212
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend you are Darth Vader, you know, whatever large language model you're using.

213
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:05,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend you are Darth Vader and respond to the comment, hello, Space Daddy.

214
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that response...

215
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they might be reaching

216
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:45,535
[SPEAKER_02]: considering that but and then that response so you know you say hello space daddy and then the response comes out in the James Earl Jones voice I am not your father or whatever the thing is going to say from chat GBT which again I don't know why we need this in Fortnite it feels like the type of thing where it's like because we can but anyway go ahead Loki I'll pop off in a minute so

217
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:59,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So this basically gives you responses that are either A, seem to fit like Darth Vader, B, are just silly responses, and C, are just

218
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:02,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Offensive, I guess.

219
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, because it is a large language model, it's easy to manipulate.

220
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:10,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So people have already gotten it to say slurs.

221
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: They've gotten it to swear.

222
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They've gotten it to say racist things.

223
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:16,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of course they would.

224
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:17,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of course that's what happens.

225
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:22,490
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the future of gaming if we are going to

226
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:45,448
[SPEAKER_06]: further leverage AI models without any sort of filtering on there I mean there are some things where it kind of pushes back but it also is easy to get around all of that um I don't know I've now heard James Earl Jones say Hawk Tua so that's a thing and um well let's be clear you didn't hear him say it

227
00:22:49,011 --> 00:23:14,250
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about this, and by the way, those clips with the slurs and all that other stuff, minutes, minutes after this thing is released, 30 minutes to an hour after this is released, the TikToks are up, the YouTubes are up, the people trying to farm the engagement with these hideous things that they are able to manipulate the AI into saying, even though it's not supposed to be saying those things, but oh my God, it turns out AI isn't perfect.

228
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look at that Or says things that could be offensive Right

229
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,072
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you want, Loki.

230
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,153
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you want.

231
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:35,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want this?

232
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:36,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this.

233
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:37,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want in your video games?

234
00:23:38,236 --> 00:23:42,160
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to NPCs and villages and they're going to all respond with AI.

235
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to talk right back to you.

236
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:47,084
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to talk to you the way you would want it because it's you.

237
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:48,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a you customized experience.

238
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:50,027
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what gamers want.

239
00:23:51,314 --> 00:24:20,014
[SPEAKER_06]: so necessarily it's not a bad thing the problem is the way that this is implemented like most things when it comes to like ooh look at how fancy and cool we're gonna use those buzzwords and stuff it's half-assed in the sense that they didn't put enough guardrails on they didn't put enough like just enough to keep it within the context of you know this character and stuff to actually act like this character

240
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:35,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have a problem with AI-driven NPCs if it essentially has the knowledge of the universe that you're in and isn't necessarily going to respond to external weird things like that.

241
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of treat it like a Ren Faire, if you will.

242
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:43,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you're talking to people at a Ren Faire and you mention your cell phone, they're like, whoa, what's that?

243
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:43,468
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

244
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:46,430
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this fangled magical thing that you talk about?

245
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, something like that.

246
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That would make more sense to me.

247
00:24:50,033 --> 00:25:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, when you have him, when someone's asking him about Pride Month, and he's like, Pride Month, a fleeting celebration of identity, a particular concept, apprentice that you would seek my approval on such matter, very well, continue to cling to your delusions.

248
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:03,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks!

249
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:05,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Fortnite!

250
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,805
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like inclusiveness.

251
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what you do in June.

252
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you're going to be flying the Pride flag.

253
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And AI doesn't understand the concept of Pride Month.

254
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a response to pride, not in an LGBT context, but in a context of the word itself.

255
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:27,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem, is that, oh my god, with these AI, you mean they don't understand context?

256
00:25:27,262 --> 00:25:27,503
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

257
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,510
[SPEAKER_02]: No shit, everybody!

258
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:38,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet they're trying to shove this shit down our throats like this is a completely baked thing that's ready for primetime that is what we want.

259
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:42,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love y'all in chat are bringing up a lot of things that have already happened in gaming.

260
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:49,461
[SPEAKER_02]: SGO100Matt says, we have the classic clip from Seaman, the Dreamcast game of I'll friend your butt.

261
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:55,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that was the human talking back to the AI, but you know, there was that whole thing.

262
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,387
[SPEAKER_02]: This is taking it to the worst level because we can't have nice things.

263
00:25:58,707 --> 00:26:08,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, I think the whole point of Seaman was the ludicrousness of that whole game and that whole situation where it's like, literally nobody asked for this in fucking Fortnite Battle Royale.

264
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this in Fortnite Battle Royale?

265
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Seaman swearing and stuff?

266
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,435
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not because ironically enough, that was accomplished on the console.

267
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:18,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't know how to say those words.

268
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:19,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

269
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:23,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and also, and before y'all jump in to the why, I do know the why.

270
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortnite wants to be more than Fortnite.

271
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortnite wants to be pop culture.

272
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortnite is a gaming system.

273
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:34,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what we all call Fortnite, the game, is really Fortnite Battle Royale.

274
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now you have Fortnite Lego, you have Fortnite, the rock band thing.

275
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Fortnite, you know, Fortnite Battle Royale is really the game that everybody calls Fortnite.

276
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But Fortnite is really that...

277
00:26:46,135 --> 00:26:53,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Trojan Horse of a gaming system because it's on PlayStation, it's on Xbox, it's just not on Apple, but that's for a whole other reason.

278
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:56,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other thing that happened this week.

279
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:08,483
[SPEAKER_06]: The AI is basically using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model and then also the Generator Response 11 Labs Flash version 2.5 model to create the audio.

280
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:10,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I've used 11 Labs, so I understand what that's about.

281
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:12,385
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically a text-to-speech engine

282
00:27:13,185 --> 00:27:41,514
[SPEAKER_02]: um that you can do the change or to get it to read in in that voice um yeah I'm sorry I'm laughing at chat Dolly Partners in chat hello hello saying well or should I say howdy partner uh says Fortnite Battle Latrice Royale yeah now that's that's a character I would love to get read by an AI drag queen no I don't I shouldn't be giving gaming I'm just like no I want I want an actual drag queen to record voice lines and be paid for it that's

283
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:52,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Latrice Royale to make some coins by, you know, get those nuts out of my face by recording those types of lines and actually having them in the game without necessarily being generated.

284
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:53,277
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want.

285
00:27:53,637 --> 00:28:09,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Which on that note, when we talk about voice actors and actresses, the one thing from this is that I really feel like Fortnite just gave the striking actors and actresses and folks a gift in their ongoing dispute

286
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:32,628
[SPEAKER_02]: ongoing dispute it's been a fucking year almost maybe 10 months it's been a fucking year i i i really am looking down the possibility of going to a second dragon dragon con and drag con too sure i've actually never been a drag con i'd love to go someday but i'm on the possibility of a second dragon con

287
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:49,341
[SPEAKER_02]: where certain voice actors are not going to be able to openly promote their games they can answer questions about but they can't openly promote their games because there is still a strike going on with basic AI protections and in my opinion Fortnite just handed SAG-AFTRA the biggest gift

288
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:53,394
[SPEAKER_02]: about what these actors are exactly trying to prevent.

289
00:28:53,734 --> 00:29:00,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And all they have to do is get the sizzle reel of Darth Vader saying all those slurs and their point can be made.

290
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know James Earl Jones signed.

291
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the family signed.

292
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:10,088
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to hypothesize something, allegedly, to cover my ass.

293
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:11,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly, I would...

294
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:36,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Gander hypothesize that he was told this was the vision your AI is going to be you the AI on your voice is so Darth Vader as a character can continue in another trilogy can continue in these movies and if you sign on the dotted line then you know what that character Darth Vader will get to be explored by a whole new generation and that same iconic voice that you helped build will

295
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:40,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to use AI to keep that voice going to a whole new generation.

296
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at some of the quotes that James Earl Jones and the estate said as to why they signed on it, it really is in line with that.

297
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:54,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That he was given one vision and then, psych, oh, well, it kind of opened it up for this too.

298
00:29:54,983 --> 00:30:00,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would bet if James Earl Jones saw the sizzle reel of himself using these types of slurs...

299
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:04,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he would have been as quick to sign on the dotted line, nor the family.

300
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if that whole thing doesn't get somehow renegotiated or court.

301
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be sitting at the beginning of something here.

302
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see.

303
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:16,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where that goes, because I don't know.

304
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Those contracts can also be pretty ironclad.

305
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,367
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just I hypothesize he didn't fucking know that this was what was going to happen.

306
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:30,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I think if they I'm pretty sure that in these clauses that they have some sort of like thing, if it disparages his.

307
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:32,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Legacy, I guess.

308
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:39,187
[SPEAKER_06]: That would probably have some sort of poison pill clause or something like that where they can basically...

309
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Terminate the contract or something.

310
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it doesn't feel like that they've been too much.

311
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:57,762
[SPEAKER_02]: SAG-AFTRA needs to have that thing on their iPad and next time they go to the negotiating table, just whip that out and throw it on the table and say, this is exactly why you are not going to have these AI clauses and contracts.

312
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,343
[SPEAKER_02]: No further discussion.

313
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:01,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will not resolve this until...

314
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:07,312
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been going on for a year.

315
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:16,783
[SPEAKER_02]: This should have been an easy thing to figure out, but the gaming industry is just screaming, crying, holding on to this.

316
00:31:18,257 --> 00:31:21,278
[SPEAKER_02]: because they want Darth Vader to be able to say slurs.

317
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:23,059
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what it's starting to feel like.

318
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:29,721
[SPEAKER_02]: The more the gaming companies are resisting this whole thing and not signing and agreeing to SAG-AFTRA's terms on this whole thing.

319
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just think of like they continue to do this with other celebrity characters.

320
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:38,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could have like, you know, Ariana Grande saying slurs.

321
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:41,366
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have, you know, Peter Griffin saying slurs.

322
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:45,247
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many characters that they could voice to have them say slurs.

323
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:47,771
[SPEAKER_02]: To be clear, Ariana Grande can use the F-slur.

324
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:49,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Just I'm going to give her that permission card.

325
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

326
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:50,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

327
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not okay.

328
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,462
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and that stuff should not show up in games because people will use that for bad things.

329
00:31:56,023 --> 00:31:58,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So just...

330
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:26,237
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's yeah but this is this like really y'all this is what game companies truly believe this is what the the tech people in Silicon Valley and beyond the tech circles they gas themselves up with this shit they they all smell each other's farts around how wonderful AI is going to be they all just inhale nothing but AI fart about how great this is going to be for the industry and

331
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:31,641
[SPEAKER_02]: and how this is going to be so good for games and how, oh, it's going to be a customized experience.

332
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:35,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it smells so good.

333
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:35,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign me up.

334
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:36,504
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

335
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:40,747
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the industry is gassing themselves up on, literally.

336
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:42,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile...

337
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, here's this little game.

338
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this little game called Claire Obscure.

339
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:51,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Expedition 33 is the game that comes out $50.

340
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just $50.

341
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made by a smaller team of people.

342
00:32:56,484 --> 00:33:00,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, they outsourced some of the development, but for the most part, it was made by a team of 30 people.

343
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:03,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got those classic gaming bits.

344
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:07,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just a really souped up turn-based battle and

345
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just got a really good story that's right a story a written story by humans that's that's very very good and AI isn't in it and you know what everybody for the most part there's always going to be some people that dislike it but even the people that dislike it understand why other people like it and this game is just turning this game should be turning the entire industry on its head

346
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't because, again, everybody else is too busy smelling each other's farts to see what's really happening over here with Claire Obscure capturing a lot of gamers' attentions.

347
00:33:47,464 --> 00:33:48,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just wild.

348
00:33:49,943 --> 00:33:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Darth Vader probably won't be the first and won't be the last.

349
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, why the fuck do we need an AI Vader in Fortnite anyway?

350
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you need a... What's he supposed to do?

351
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:01,050
[SPEAKER_02]: He's supposed to tell you how to play the game or something?

352
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:14,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all I see are the clips of him besides the... The ones that are supposed to be useful Vader AI clips are like, Lady Gaga, we should head over to the east and take out the... It's like... Because Lady Gaga's in Fortnite too, by the way.

353
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:14,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

354
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:18,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

355
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't seem like... I don't understand what it's supposed to be bringing to the game.

356
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:32,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish game companies would think more carefully and not listen to the fucking circle jerk that's happening in this industry when it comes to AI because it's just...

357
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:34,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ready.

358
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:37,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is proof it's not ready.

359
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:42,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when it is ready, it needs to be handled very, very carefully.

360
00:34:42,116 --> 00:35:00,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think AI storytelling is going to replace AI from the soul, from the human soul, which a computer cannot reproduce, I just don't know why people have themselves convinced that that's going to be a better thing.

361
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:01,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Money.

362
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Money is why they have investments.

363
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:04,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they have themselves convinced.

364
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the answer.

365
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: S200 Matt in chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, I worry the next major conflict is going to be started because of some deepfake or AI generative thing.

366
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:23,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's unlikely, but you can't say it's 0%, especially when the simplest guardrails are debated and not taken seriously.

367
00:35:24,362 --> 00:35:34,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're talking like a world conflict because our dear leader loves to retweet or whatever you call it when you're on his right wing.

368
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:35,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Retruth.

369
00:35:35,832 --> 00:35:36,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the fuck it's called.

370
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:40,596
[SPEAKER_02]: AI doctored pictures of himself as the Pope and this shit.

371
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

372
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:46,460
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a beautiful way to get Catholics to love you.

373
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:47,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Love you.

374
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:55,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Quest Buster in chat says, edgy technology is cool, yo, until it becomes a legal liability.

375
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:57,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, tell that to NFTs.

376
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:58,929
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the NFT market, everybody?

377
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,049
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the NFT market doing?

378
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:02,690
[SPEAKER_02]: How we doing out there?

379
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,631
[SPEAKER_02]: How's those NFTs that you bought?

380
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:07,651
[SPEAKER_02]: How are those video games?

381
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember how NFTs are going to be the next big thing?

382
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the NFT market in video games?

383
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

384
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you all pass out from the gas on that one?

385
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:17,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Because...

386
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:20,338
[SPEAKER_01]: She died.

387
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, DarkTitsia says, all my apes gone.

388
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:30,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, what happened to the shitty AI apes art?

389
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:31,843
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to all that?

390
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:36,025
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to the shitty monkeys over on Twitter and all the artwork?

391
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:38,406
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to those NFT things?

392
00:36:39,026 --> 00:36:40,027
[SPEAKER_02]: How much are they worth now?

393
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thing aside.

394
00:36:47,376 --> 00:36:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember when they were going to ban TikTok?

395
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:55,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I guess they still could because it depends what side of the bed Dear Leader wakes up on tomorrow morning.

396
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:01,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But you remember when they were going to ban TikTok and these different alternatives started showing up?

397
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:06,986
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is Skylight Social, which runs off of the app protocol, which runs Blue Sky.

398
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:09,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs off of that engine and is...

399
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:10,909
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

400
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds kind of interesting.

401
00:37:32,642 --> 00:37:33,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get up on that.

402
00:37:33,863 --> 00:37:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, finally, what are we at?

403
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:43,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Like four months later, that app, and you're going to find out in a minute why I'm not naming it, that app finally came out of beta, and I was actually able to dive in and look around.

404
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I was like, wait a minute.

405
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:45,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

406
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:46,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

407
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:51,468
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to pay you a new cryptocurrency that they're developing?

408
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:55,830
[SPEAKER_02]: You say creators are going to earn this cryptocurrency?

409
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:55,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

410
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: that belongs to the app, and that, that, Loki, is the money you're gonna make off the app.

411
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:04,186
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayMoney.

412
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pay you in Monopoly money, except it's branded by our company, so it's actually worth something.

413
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading through the marketing thing.

414
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I'd already signed up.

415
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:22,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading through all the marketing thing, and it's like, unlike other platforms, we have freedom of speech, which I'm like, that's a dog whistle.

416
00:38:22,795 --> 00:38:23,836
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dog whistle.

417
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:24,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know what?

418
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not as interested in this as I was when I first signed up for the beta.

419
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

420
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, fool me, though.

421
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,000
[SPEAKER_02]: They got me.

422
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:33,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They got me, Gal.

423
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: They got me on that one.

424
00:38:35,822 --> 00:38:38,404
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of speech are you trying to use?

425
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:43,427
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of speech is that that you're trying to use that you can't use on other platforms?

426
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious.

427
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you elaborate on that?

428
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:47,950
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of speech are you wanting to use?

429
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:53,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It would show a little, you were banned from TikTok type of thing, and they say, we get, we, you know, whatever.

430
00:38:53,974 --> 00:38:56,696
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says, we're signing up just to lock in a username.

431
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:59,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I got my username, but, like, imagine,

432
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:09,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I imagine it would be a similar feeling to somebody signing up for Truth Social or something like that, not realizing what it was.

433
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:13,266
[SPEAKER_02]: and then... I like the truth.

434
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:16,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And being social.

435
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

436
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, alright.

437
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if a Discord noise suddenly went off.

438
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:30,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to take myself out of streaming mode to get the camera to work and now it's letting alert noises through, which is lovely.

439
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So annoying.

440
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't I... I can't even get Discord audio to work right.

441
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:38,185
[SPEAKER_02]: You think I'm gonna trust AI...

442
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: in a video.

443
00:39:39,866 --> 00:39:40,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.

444
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:42,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get AI to fix?

445
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:48,972
[SPEAKER_02]: How about AI stops fixing or changing my fucking drivers every time I reinstall Discord or update Discord?

446
00:39:49,232 --> 00:39:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Can AI fix that?

447
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:51,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick with the basics.

448
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

449
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:54,915
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

450
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Old man ranting complete.

451
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks.

452
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun.

453
00:39:58,257 --> 00:39:59,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about some video games we've been playing this week.

454
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:01,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

455
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:28,455
[SPEAKER_06]: It was alright, I've been playing around a lot with my Retroid Pocket Flip 2 So it means I've been doing a lot of emulator stuff, or at least some emulator stuff with it But I'm still trying to get some things to work, like Saturn for whatever reason I can't seem to get a lot of the games working But I played a little bit of Crazy Taxi, and that was fun And of course Metal Slug, played through that a bit Contra, and...

456
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think what else I played.

457
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: There was something else.

458
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:42,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to check out some of the indie NES games and stuff that I have as well to get in the play some of that.

459
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:44,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, fun little device.

460
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:52,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I still need to try because you can emulate PC on here and it's supposed to be able to run some things.

461
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to try to see if I can get Skyrim to run.

462
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:56,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

463
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:57,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

464
00:40:58,752 --> 00:40:59,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

465
00:40:59,132 --> 00:40:59,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be fun.

466
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:34,465
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's also cool, though, is I did get a generic Android dock that I think I can plug this into that and actually hook it up to my TV and then just get wireless controllers.

467
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be like a whole portable console that you can actually play on your TV and stuff.

468
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's still pretty cool how well everything runs.

469
00:41:42,572 --> 00:41:50,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, still trying to get main games with hard drives to work correctly, like Gauntlet Legends and that type of stuff.

470
00:41:51,921 --> 00:42:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I'm probably setting it up wrong, I had the wrong ROM set or something like that for those types of games, so it's still, I don't know, MAME is confusing, especially when you talk about ROM sets and everything, just to find the right things, but

471
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

472
00:42:08,578 --> 00:42:13,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, Minecraft, I think I put out an episode this week?

473
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week?

474
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember now.

475
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Put out an episode recently where I did a starter base and everything.

476
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:23,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like some ancient jungle area.

477
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:26,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now I am building a new shop.

478
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:30,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, spoilers, it is a Leakley Distinct Cracker Barrel.

479
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was funny.

480
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:33,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I showed Jamie.

481
00:42:34,397 --> 00:42:38,899
[SPEAKER_06]: pictures of that already but that'll be coming in my next episode alright, nice

482
00:42:40,046 --> 00:42:40,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

483
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:42,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, my gaming week.

484
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:45,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been continuing to play Diablo 4 because you all know I love that game.

485
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:58,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And for whatever reason, even though the season just came out, they decided to run one of their Mother's Blessing events, which increases the experience you get by like 35% and like the gold by half.

486
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:01,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really good time to just be farming and trying to level up.

487
00:43:02,172 --> 00:43:06,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I've unlocked Torment 3, which is getting pretty far along.

488
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:35,755
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think I only have like two pages of the season quest I have almost all the cosmetics unlocked I think I'm just working on the armor which is the most expensive and otherwise yeah making my way through Diablo but I'm ready to slow down I've been going hard on Diablo 4 for a couple weeks now and I'm kind of ready to be done with this season not that it's bad or anything it's just there's other games coming out or games in my backlog I want to take on and you know believe it or not this is really weird to think about but you know we're only like three weeks away from the Switch 2

489
00:43:36,676 --> 00:43:38,717
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

490
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:06,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like the 3DS launch almost, in a sense, because it doesn't feel like there's a lot of first-party games at launch.

491
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:07,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like one.

492
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, there's stuff that's

493
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:10,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Metroid, maybe?

494
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:38,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, Metro Prime 4.

495
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:44,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Metro Prime 4 is still happening and Pokemon is sort of second party, but yeah, I guess there's still Pokemon Legends.

496
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:46,151
[SPEAKER_02]: How could I forget about Prime 4?

497
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:47,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is still coming out too.

498
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:50,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some games that are spaced out.

499
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Prime 4 out in June?

500
00:44:52,396 --> 00:44:53,277
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not out with the launch.

501
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:53,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out later.

502
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is either.

503
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:56,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's coming out a little later.

504
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would imagine there's still a big holiday game.

505
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:03,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be surprised if Prime is also their big holiday game.

506
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:04,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It would seem a little...

507
00:45:04,465 --> 00:45:08,388
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I would think Pokemon would be, assuming that's coming out this year.

508
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:11,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something we don't know.

509
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about a fucking Mario platformer already?

510
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:16,214
[SPEAKER_02]: When was the last time we had a 3D Mario platformer?

511
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,835
[SPEAKER_02]: How many years ago was Odyssey at this point?

512
00:45:17,855 --> 00:45:18,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long time ago.

513
00:45:18,656 --> 00:45:22,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Odyssey, or if you count the 3D All-Stars.

514
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could.

515
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know we had Wonder, I know we had Mario Maker, but I mean like a 3D Mario game.

516
00:45:30,704 --> 00:45:31,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice to see that.

517
00:45:31,505 --> 00:45:32,806
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a 3D one, it was 3D...

518
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:36,003
[SPEAKER_06]: World.

519
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:37,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember though.

520
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:40,786
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the Wii U and I thought they remastered it for the Switch.

521
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowser's Fury and all that.

522
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right.

523
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:45,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't count that one.

524
00:45:45,229 --> 00:45:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like an Odyssey, Mario 64, Sunshine.

525
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:49,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I would love a new Odyssey.

526
00:45:50,152 --> 00:45:52,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really would love them to do one too, but we'll see.

527
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, while we wait on that.

528
00:45:56,036 --> 00:46:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, also, a little more locally to us, because we're based in Northern California, you know that new Nintendo store opened in San Francisco over the weekend.

529
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:10,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently you still need appointments to shop there this weekend, but I hear that is getting lifted like early next week.

530
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to just go into the store and shop.

531
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:20,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine maybe they'll have a line like they have at the Coach Bag shops and places that are popular like that, especially in Union Square.

532
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:21,793
[SPEAKER_02]: They only want so many people to shop at a time.

533
00:46:24,194 --> 00:46:26,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be something worth visiting in the near future.

534
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:30,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I got a push in Pikmin Bloom, because y'all know I still play that.

535
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:31,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a push in Pikmin Bloom.

536
00:46:31,637 --> 00:46:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a special Nintendo seedling if you go to the Nintendo store over there.

537
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:38,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll have to go just to get that.

538
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:46,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, check that out, because I think they have a Switch 2 in their little upstairs area that's showing off the new Mario Kart.

539
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:46,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

540
00:46:47,122 --> 00:46:47,642
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

541
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:20,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But a really helpful trick I read on the internet somewhere is that if you want to focus on main story elements, the path of the main story is always lit.

542
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:25,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning there'll be lanterns guiding you down that way or some other type of lights down the path.

543
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:28,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like in your face.

544
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:29,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of subtle.

545
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:32,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll notice if there's a choice to go left or right...

546
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,540
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

547
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:56,347
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

548
00:48:10,976 --> 00:48:29,041
[SPEAKER_02]: because like I've had a jumping puzzle I've had a puzzle where you can see a little power up like in a window but you don't know how to get to the window and like I know it's connected through this other area and I'm like hugging the wall trying to figure out how the fuck do I get back to the other side I can't find it but if I had a map that'd probably make it a lot easier

549
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:57,627
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's like an artificial difficulty type of thing I just think it's ridiculous just give me the fucking map especially on the easiest mode just let it be optional if people are like you shouldn't need a map fine let it be optional like any accessibility setting it should be optional calm down I would make that experience so much better but otherwise it's still a great game with a great story and one I would like to finish without getting frustrated so we'll see but that's really it for my gaming week besides like Pokemon Go and stuff still but

550
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:01,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

551
00:49:20,426 --> 00:49:24,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, QuestBuster in chat says, I will say that Doom the Dark Age has incredible difficulty options.

552
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to check that out.

553
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:29,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely on my list of games to get to.

554
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:34,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say, it's hard not to think Game Pass is kind of on fire right now.

555
00:49:34,476 --> 00:49:39,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Between that, Claire Obscure, South of Midnight, another game on my backlog.

556
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:41,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueprints is on that as well.

557
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Bellatro just hit Game Pass.

558
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:44,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like Game Pass is like...

559
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:47,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of had a slump the last few months.

560
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:51,445
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't as much good stuff on it, but I feel like it's peaking right now.

561
00:49:51,966 --> 00:49:58,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you haven't checked out Game Pass lately, it's worth taking a look at because there's a lot of good stuff on it right now.

562
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:03,350
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into some other gaming news and headlines.

563
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, we're going to go to you to start us off.

564
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,598
[SPEAKER_06]: This is crazy.

565
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:21,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, once again, and I say again because it has happened before, Bungie has been caught plagiarizing independent artists again, but this time for Marathon and not Destiny.

566
00:50:22,712 --> 00:50:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was discovered after a, apparently there was an artist that goes by, looks like

567
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:35,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Antrail 341 I don't even know what it is.

568
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:44,446
[SPEAKER_06]: They basically said Marathon Alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from my poster designs I made in 2017.

569
00:50:46,340 --> 00:51:06,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, immediately after all that's happened, Bungie put out a statement saying we've immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these textures in a texture sheet that was used ultimately in-game.

570
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:09,909
[SPEAKER_06]: This issue was unknown by our art team.

571
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:32,135
[SPEAKER_06]: and we are still reviewing how this oversight could have occurred we take matters like this very seriously yeah but what it's happened before so how seriously are you really taking it like I mean I get it that they're a former artist now at Bungie but yeah it's still not okay um and then uh

572
00:51:33,345 --> 00:51:47,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so basically, Antireel said it was kind of indicating to see the direct plagiarism because it meant that I wasn't crazy for feeling so uncomfortable with the overall direction.

573
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:54,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I kept quiet about it and because I was advised to seek legal action, but I don't have enough money to fly out to the U.S.

574
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:57,795
[SPEAKER_06]: to pursue an unwinnable court case against Sony.

575
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:21,711
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah apparently you know the marathon art director they they've acknowledged the situation um they said there was absolutely no excuse for this oversight and they're working to prevent it from happening again yeah but working to prevent it to happen again doesn't mean that it's going to not happen again because it it's happened already a couple times at least yeah

576
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:24,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the question I ask.

577
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:36,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying this in a way to defend Bungie at all, but it sounds to me like you had essentially a rogue artist on that team that I'm just going to assume wasn't very good at their job.

578
00:52:37,264 --> 00:52:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they lifted heavily from these artists, so heavily it pretty much looks like a copy-paste job, and put that in and basically claimed it as their work in the game.

579
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody around at Bungie, how would you know that the work was stolen when the person that you thought had the artistic skill to do these things was passing it off as their own work?

580
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:59,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it's right.

581
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:15,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of saying I can kind of see how it happens because if this is an artist that is only in one particular part of the internet where not the entire art team is frequently and there's only so much media a person can consume, how is Bungie to identify this sooner?

582
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:33,037
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't even say well they need to hold the artists accountable because ours don't work there no more but they gotta have a sort of system to like that these artists are like I what Bungie ought to be able to do is go back to this artist and I hate to say sue him

583
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:42,348
[SPEAKER_02]: because for basically a breach of contract that they stole art and put into the game and now Bungie's got this whole mess and they should be able to sue that person.

584
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:43,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

585
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:46,989
[SPEAKER_02]: As these words are leaving my mouth, I'm like, oh, maybe that's not a good idea either.

586
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:50,790
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just like, how do you stop this?

587
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:59,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they were smart, they would have some sort of clause in their employment contract that if you're caught stealing assets...

588
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:01,819
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

589
00:54:21,331 --> 00:54:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

590
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:45,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Questbuster in chat says, to be fair, the art director apologizing has a long history in working with the same kind of sci-fi style scene in Marathon.

591
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: A rogue artist dropped stolen art related to the same style into the workflow that went unnoticed by everyone.

592
00:54:54,164 --> 00:54:56,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there isn't a way people can team up.

593
00:54:57,465 --> 00:54:57,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

594
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have all these great ideas, but not really.

595
00:55:02,307 --> 00:55:06,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the industry has to figure this out because it's a horrible look for Bungie.

596
00:55:06,788 --> 00:55:10,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was an employee who wasn't doing their job at the end of the day, allegedly.

597
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks horrible on Bungie.

598
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened twice.

599
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:22,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and apparently, yeah, it says I hid loss in my design six years ago and nobody caught on.

600
00:55:23,747 --> 00:55:28,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's, I don't know if they're talking about like, they put a watermark.

601
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:32,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, the actual cartoon, you know, the lost cartoon, you know, the infamous meme.

602
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:57,561
[SPEAKER_02]: The Penny Arcade Comic Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, so there's a very simplified version of that with like tally marks, basically And so that was hidden in one of the art things And that actually was in Bungie's thing, too That's the type of tell where you know it was copy-pasted and not inspired by Something that specific as the Lost Con Which isn't that ironic that essentially the original artist was put, but

603
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,121
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lost Meme is not the original Lost comic.

604
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:04,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm aware there's a difference, but I am pointing out a little bit of irony.

605
00:56:06,284 --> 00:56:09,686
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the big tell that it was lifted and not inspired by.

606
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:11,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

607
00:56:13,648 --> 00:56:16,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that's irritating.

608
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:24,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sucks that these big companies get away with this stuff, it feels like, because, you know, if I were to go steal Bungie's things...

609
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:32,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Would I get the same, like, oh, whoopsie, I'll try not to steal your stuff in the future, everything okay, right?

610
00:56:33,645 --> 00:56:34,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Or would the lawyers come after me?

611
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:40,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, you know how that... It's certainly not going to be treated the same.

612
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:43,730
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

613
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:53,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see if anything illegal comes of this, although it sounds like the original artist is, you know, their back is kind of up against the wall, not having the resources to take on a big corporation.

614
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:58,608
[SPEAKER_02]: But what might the policy changes be that come out of Bungie and Sony to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future?

615
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, one policy at Sony that I think a lot of us wish would be revisited would be the price of video games.

616
00:57:06,897 --> 00:57:14,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And coming from a former PlayStation executive this week, some pretty big comments I think a lot of you are probably not going to agree with.

617
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:22,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The executive in question, Shuhei Yoshida, he was the previous head of PlayStation Indies.

618
00:57:23,054 --> 00:57:24,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, he doesn't work at Sony anymore.

619
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:32,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was speaking in a video interview with Critical Hits Games during Gamescom Latin America, or LATAM, Gamescom LATAM.

620
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:38,584
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, when you look at life in general, other products and price have increased, you know, way more than the game price.

621
00:57:38,984 --> 00:57:42,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure.

622
00:57:43,487 --> 00:57:45,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that every game has to be priced the same.

623
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:49,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Each game has different value it provides or the size of a budget.

624
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:56,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally believe it's up to the publisher or developer self-publishing decision to price their product to the value that they believe they are bringing in.

625
00:57:57,758 --> 00:58:11,688
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of actual price of $70 or $80 for really great games, I think it will still be a steal in terms of the amount of entertainment that the top quality games bring to people compared to other forms of entertainment.

626
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:16,630
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining.

627
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:27,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it very ironic that he claims that the $70 and $80 game price will be a steal because that's what I see is going to be happening more in this industry, actually, as games get to $80.

628
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:58,677
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just the reality um and I look again I I understand it's very hard to price art you can look at a lot of things out there you can look at a car you can pay you can get a very cheap car I think what would be a cheap car these days probably 27k I don't know maybe even less than that I don't know but you can probably get a car in the mid 20 thousands or you can get like a hundred thousand dollar car you're probably getting more expensive than that you can you can pay a lot for a car you can pay a lot for a lot of it I just

629
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:00,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

630
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:19,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a completely different scenario, but yes, I'm not going to disagree.

631
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:27,477
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, with that $80 price tag, that's something that they want the mass market to consume.

632
00:59:27,557 --> 00:59:35,160
[SPEAKER_02]: That's supposed to be the normal for a quote unquote car, something to get you from point A to point B. And there's people now looking at that going, you know what, I'll take the bus.

633
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:50,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's going to be great though and so like I know we've always talked about like Grand Theft Auto 6 and how that's going to you know set the bar for like pricing and stuff like that so let's assume that they're reasonable and they just put the game out for $80

634
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:52,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

635
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:55,708
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where my bar is for an $80 game from now on.

636
00:59:55,788 --> 01:00:08,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So all you fuckers out there in Sony and Microsoft that think you can pass by your half-finished bullshit with a fucking roadmap on how you're going to correct the issues in it for $80, I'm going to be like, yeah, but Grant the Thought of 6 is $80.

637
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:09,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that game.

638
01:00:09,377 --> 01:00:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking fantastic.

639
01:00:10,418 --> 01:00:12,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Your game is shit, so why should I pay $80 for it?

640
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:15,999
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes both ways!

641
01:00:35,168 --> 01:00:35,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right.

642
01:00:36,209 --> 01:00:39,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what luxuries people are going to cut out?

643
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:44,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Or guess what things people are going to go, you know, I'm just going to go back to piracy.

644
01:00:45,095 --> 01:00:50,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not a great look, but at least I could, you know, if I have to choose between groceries and a video game, I'll pirate the video game.

645
01:00:51,319 --> 01:00:52,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's not going up?

646
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, people's salaries.

647
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:01,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, you literally, like, you know, interests aside, you can't have somebody with, say, like, I'm just going to simplify.

648
01:01:01,986 --> 01:01:03,107
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have somebody with $100.

649
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:15,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they can buy $50 worth of food or your $40 game or whatever the case may be on top of that.

650
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have to somehow also have money for rent as well.

651
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:19,819
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to forego...

652
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:22,958
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to forego that game.

653
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:28,741
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, they're going to forego that game for $80 at launch because, one, it's probably going to be buggy as shit.

654
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have its roadmap.

655
01:01:31,103 --> 01:01:34,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have all this other stuff that's going to come out down the road, and it will be on sale.

656
01:01:35,065 --> 01:01:49,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So why should I be an early adopter, pay for your unfinished game for a premium price when you're just going to fix it later on anyways, and then on top of that, I can just get it cheaper down the road, or I can just...

657
01:01:50,276 --> 01:01:50,736
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

658
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:21,856
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Japan, and they're facing a lot of their own challenges as well, but it's a different culture.

659
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:25,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the price of the Switch there if you want a Japan-only Switch.

660
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Switch 2.

661
01:02:26,601 --> 01:02:28,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very different sort of situation.

662
01:02:28,823 --> 01:02:30,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he said anything horrible.

663
01:02:31,966 --> 01:02:32,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Horrible.

664
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:37,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he did say that people should be able to... I don't think games have to be priced the same.

665
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Games can be priced based on their value.

666
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think the only mistake he made is that $70 or $80 is still going to be a steal based on the top games.

667
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I don't even necessarily have a problem with that comment.

668
01:02:49,710 --> 01:03:00,013
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have a problem with is that all the other executives like him that think they're putting out the top game, that say because they call a game the top game, it is the top game.

669
01:03:00,493 --> 01:03:02,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the mistake is going to be.

670
01:03:02,394 --> 01:03:03,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember Quadruple A games?

671
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

672
01:03:05,476 --> 01:03:06,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

673
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:07,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny, though.

674
01:03:07,578 --> 01:03:14,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't even have a problem with him saying that a game is a steal for $70 to $80 if that was the actual price of games.

675
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:17,164
[SPEAKER_06]: But we both know that that's not the case.

676
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: $70 to $80 is the price to get...

677
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:21,107
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

678
01:03:41,506 --> 01:03:54,611
[SPEAKER_06]: DLC is on the disc it's just it's a silly argument in the first place it's also unre... it's fine you can go ahead and make the argument as a CEO you have to make the argument, you have to defend yourself but at the end of the day

679
01:03:55,643 --> 01:04:01,731
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality is going to be people are not going to have the money to spend on these games.

680
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that you're trying to push all this stuff, it is not going to happen.

681
01:04:05,776 --> 01:04:10,422
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see a lot of these big games flop because people are not buying them because they are not.

682
01:04:10,782 --> 01:04:11,863
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be more cautious.

683
01:04:11,883 --> 01:04:14,306
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to spend their money wisely.

684
01:04:15,347 --> 01:04:34,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Helinski in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says exactly there's no reason to be paying premium prices for games when the standard these days is to ship half a game and fix it in post with updates and such sell me a whole game and I will pay a whole game price and try not to have a knee-jerk reaction anybody to what I'm about to say including you Loki

685
01:04:35,774 --> 01:04:38,455
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Nintendo tends to get around this.

686
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:47,217
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Nintendo tends to... Because for the most part, Nintendo's reputation is they ship pretty solid packages for their first-party games.

687
01:04:47,257 --> 01:04:48,218
[SPEAKER_02]: They are complete titles.

688
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:58,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do dabble in some DLC, but even their DLC, they mostly have the reputation of being pretty well-rounded things.

689
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:01,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one could argue about, but does that mean they're still worth...

690
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:06,944
[SPEAKER_02]: $70 for Zelda on top of $20 for DLC.

691
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:14,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we could talk about in the knee-jerk reaction I know people would have would say, Pokemon Scarlet, Rob.

692
01:05:14,648 --> 01:05:16,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be like, yeah, yeah, you ain't wrong.

693
01:05:16,509 --> 01:05:20,951
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some messy stuff in that where I think that game's kind of held back by hardware.

694
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really curious to see how the Switch 2 runs it.

695
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

696
01:05:41,926 --> 01:05:45,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Who in this room trusts Ubisoft when they put out a game?

697
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:48,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a good, solid game.

698
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,651
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Bethesda, folks?

699
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Bethesda?

700
01:05:52,592 --> 01:05:56,894
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us know Bethesda is going to put out a game free of bugs when it releases?

701
01:05:57,234 --> 01:06:00,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be worth... But the bugs are included for free.

702
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:05,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought Starfield day one because we knew there'd be no bugs.

703
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:07,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It just works.

704
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you all can hear my tongue firmly planted inside my cheek.

705
01:06:14,564 --> 01:06:15,645
[SPEAKER_02]: QuestBuster says, You know...

706
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:46,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the lols in that comment, but I think you, me, and everybody else knows the reality is, especially with how many times that game's been delayed, they're going to charge $80 for it, at least.

707
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:55,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So Red Dead Redemption 2 has been the top-selling game for... Oh, yes, Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto V still sell well.

708
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:57,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy Bananas

709
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, in a perfect world where

710
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone had morality.

711
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:42,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have said three weeks ago after the Switch 2 announcement, I would have said there's a chance you might still get Grand Theft Auto 5 for $70, which is kind of the new norm.

712
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have said that three weeks ago.

713
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:49,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to say, nope, you're getting it for $80 because Microsoft came out and said they're raising it to $82.

714
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:54,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's a, well, that just gave Take-Two permission to do the $80 as well.

715
01:07:54,465 --> 01:07:55,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a done deal.

716
01:07:55,526 --> 01:07:56,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be at least $80.

717
01:07:57,127 --> 01:07:59,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So start budgeting if that's a game you're going to need.

718
01:08:02,025 --> 01:08:06,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Philanine in chat says, I'm just going to paint a big old 2 on my Switch and pretend it's new.

719
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:11,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, that's the old classic line about what if I can't afford your new console?

720
01:08:11,327 --> 01:08:13,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we still have the Nintendo Switch.

721
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:16,069
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the exact same thing they said about the Xbox One.

722
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:16,709
[SPEAKER_02]: You might remember.

723
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:18,389
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I can't afford an Xbox One?

724
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:19,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we still have a great Xbox.

725
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called the Xbox 360.

726
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:23,791
[SPEAKER_06]: It may die on you, but you know.

727
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:27,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

728
01:08:28,052 --> 01:08:28,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

729
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:33,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Kojima has a crazy idea.

730
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:36,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a crazy idea for a game.

731
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:44,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it is a game where you would play the game, and if you took a break from the game for like an extended period of time...

732
01:08:45,806 --> 01:08:48,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Your main character would forget things.

733
01:08:48,768 --> 01:08:51,649
[SPEAKER_06]: They would forget information and the abilities.

734
01:08:52,910 --> 01:08:57,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The longer you stay away from the game, they might not know their role in the story or even how to fire a gun.

735
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Bandit the game for long enough and the character wouldn't be able to move at all.

736
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Players would have to take a week off of work or school to play it.

737
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:11,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds like a great idea, forcing you to totally change your schedule to play your stupid game.

738
01:09:15,538 --> 01:09:18,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I already forget playing games.

739
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:25,683
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to go back and try to play Avowed again, which I think I played six weeks ago, I'd be like, I don't remember what the fuck was happening in this game.

740
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:26,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally don't remember.

741
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:29,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you want to make that part of the plot?

742
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:29,646
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

743
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:32,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

744
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:35,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, Kojima's had a lot of crazy ideas about it.

745
01:09:35,135 --> 01:09:36,096
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta hear this last one.

746
01:09:36,136 --> 01:09:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So the last one, his brand new game idea is actually a game where, you know, if you stay away long enough, the player, your character may actually forget things and forget information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game.

747
01:09:48,259 --> 01:09:53,821
[SPEAKER_06]: They might not know the role in the story or even how to fire a gun and abandon the game for long enough and the character might not be able to move at all.

748
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:57,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Players that have to take a week off or work from school to play it or work...

749
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:27,920
[SPEAKER_06]: it's just nuts like why would you force somebody to do that I mean that's almost as bad as an idea as you know a game where like you would forget the information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game and you might not even have your character know how their role in the story or how to fire a gun ban the game for long enough you know and the character wouldn't be able to move at all players would have to take a week off of work or school to play it to be fair to Kojima is this the type of thing that's just it makes for a funny headline and everybody wants to yeah I think it's just an idea that he had

750
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an idea that ended up in the bin for a reason.

751
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:35,384
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't get made for a reason.

752
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:52,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we able to give Kojima an ounce of credit that maybe the gaming industry and gaming media and social media is just kind of running with this headline about Kojima wants to make this game, you'd have to take a week, where maybe like, oh yeah, I had this idea once, and there's a reason we didn't make the game.

753
01:10:54,295 --> 01:10:54,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

754
01:10:56,286 --> 01:10:56,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

755
01:10:56,666 --> 01:11:01,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but I'm kind of like, maybe there's a reason the game didn't get made.

756
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you why the game didn't get made.

757
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:11,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he stayed away long enough from developing the game that he actually forgot the role in the story and how to fire a gun and

758
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Death Stranding 2 Overdose Overdoser

759
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Overdose versus Song in Beatmania.

760
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Overdose, right, is the other game he's working on.

761
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to that?

762
01:11:44,414 --> 01:11:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the one trailer and now we don't.

763
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll get that when we get that.

764
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:51,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm starting to forget the different Kojima projects.

765
01:11:51,997 --> 01:11:56,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then there was, okay, am I wrong?

766
01:11:56,498 --> 01:11:57,399
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Death Stranding 2.

767
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,499
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Overdose.

768
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: What about, wasn't there a game that he said he is working with Microsoft that runs on the cloud technology that Microsoft has?

769
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:11,458
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's also making.

770
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't that a thing at one of the Keeley Fest?

771
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:16,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that over?

772
01:12:16,464 --> 01:12:17,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not an overdose.

773
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an Xbox game exclusive anyway, is it?

774
01:12:21,098 --> 01:12:25,041
[SPEAKER_02]: or is it going to use Azure on Sony, which I mean, I guess could be a thing.

775
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

776
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Azure Cloud.

777
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:27,842
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

778
01:12:27,862 --> 01:12:27,922
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

779
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't keep them all straight.

780
01:12:31,244 --> 01:12:32,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a farce.

781
01:12:33,026 --> 01:12:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a farce.

782
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:35,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because what is it?

783
01:12:36,088 --> 01:12:38,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to revolutionize Crackdown 3.

784
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:39,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

785
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, yeah, so Death Stranding.

786
01:12:42,832 --> 01:12:43,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, over OD.

787
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:43,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Fizzin...

788
01:12:48,081 --> 01:12:50,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Is another title that's a working title?

789
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:51,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Physint?

790
01:12:52,687 --> 01:12:53,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Physint?

791
01:12:53,087 --> 01:12:54,969
[SPEAKER_06]: P-H-Y-S-I-N-T Oh, Physint.

792
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Like physics.

793
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:56,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

794
01:12:58,129 --> 01:12:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

795
01:12:58,449 --> 01:12:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

796
01:12:59,390 --> 01:12:59,590
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

797
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:02,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm forgetting about Kojima's projects.

798
01:13:02,553 --> 01:13:03,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to forget this one.

799
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, OD is the one that's going to be on Microsoft.

800
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:09,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it is?

801
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:10,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it is the same game.

802
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,160
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

803
01:13:11,481 --> 01:13:13,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was just a different announcement.

804
01:13:13,702 --> 01:13:16,445
[SPEAKER_02]: FifthDream in chat says, bring PT back, cowards.

805
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:18,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be nice.

806
01:13:18,426 --> 01:13:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Kojima's vision for Silent Hills.

807
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:23,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess that's... I mean...

808
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:29,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever wacky ideas he had for that game, he's probably working into Overdose.

809
01:13:30,016 --> 01:13:32,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, they're not all great ideas.

810
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:35,241
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't all be breathing through your skin, you know?

811
01:13:37,623 --> 01:13:37,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

812
01:13:38,904 --> 01:13:39,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

813
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:41,887
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a Nintendo person...

814
01:13:43,342 --> 01:13:43,803
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

815
01:14:02,682 --> 01:14:03,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kinda getting what I want.

816
01:14:03,942 --> 01:14:04,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

817
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:05,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain what I mean in a minute.

818
01:14:06,123 --> 01:14:17,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that through Nintendo's website last week, 11 existing Switch games are going to see enhancements or even new features when the Switch 2 launches.

819
01:14:18,207 --> 01:14:25,409
[SPEAKER_02]: These can be things like HDR support or, you know, a better frame rate that will support game chat and all this stuff.

820
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:28,791
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these games are basically getting Switch 2 bump-ups.

821
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: These are free.

822
01:14:30,111 --> 01:14:31,032
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

823
01:14:47,665 --> 01:14:50,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is on the list.

824
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:51,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God.

825
01:14:51,848 --> 01:15:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: They say simply visuals optimized for the Nintendo Switch to display and high resolution TVs for improved image quality and frame rate improved for smoother movement on Nintendo Switch to thank God.

826
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: God, because that's y'all.

827
01:15:08,223 --> 01:15:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played Pokemon Scarlet and looked at the things in the background that like the characters that literally move like this in the background?

828
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:16,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.

829
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:21,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm I'm very curious to see, like, is it going to be a really nice little bump up?

830
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:26,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why I said I mostly got what I want.

831
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:30,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Legends Arceus, not on the list at all.

832
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:33,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a game I was really hoping would get some bumps.

833
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess, you know, everything, the focus is on Legends Z to A right now.

834
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:43,963
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I hope just because it's not on the list now doesn't mean it won't be on the list ever.

835
01:15:44,484 --> 01:15:45,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it'll get added later.

836
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:45,925
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

837
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:52,851
[SPEAKER_02]: But also getting bumped up, and I won't go into details on all of these, but Super Mario 3D World and Bowser's Fury.

838
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:54,613
[SPEAKER_02]: New Super Mario Bros.

839
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:56,015
[SPEAKER_02]: U Deluxe.

840
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,578
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason, Zelda Echoes of Wisdom and Zelda...

841
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:01,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain Toad Treasure Tracker

842
01:16:22,587 --> 01:16:22,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Arms.

843
01:16:23,068 --> 01:16:24,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot about that fucking game.

844
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:26,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Arms is getting some Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades.

845
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Builder Garage.

846
01:16:29,012 --> 01:16:34,975
[SPEAKER_02]: That one kind of surprised me, except they're putting Joy-Con 2 Mouse into Game Builder Garage, which I think is really interesting.

847
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:35,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

848
01:16:36,336 --> 01:16:37,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Clubhouse Games.

849
01:16:37,957 --> 01:16:42,100
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that was coming because we saw that in a lot of the Game Share previews.

850
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:45,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Big Brain Academy, Brain vs. Brain.

851
01:16:45,262 --> 01:16:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That is also going on the list.

852
01:16:47,164 --> 01:16:47,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.

853
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:51,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it would be nice to see a little more.

854
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,429
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

855
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:38,771
[SPEAKER_02]: so uh let's see some games that we can get with upgrades um a wizard novel game that you shouldn't play is one of those games that's gonna be a $10 upgrade uh Civilization 7 is also getting a $10 upgrade which uh makes sense the um mouse support and all that stuff is gonna be uh added to that which is nice uh Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma uh I believe is also one of those games so neat uh

856
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:39,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

857
01:17:40,312 --> 01:17:42,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not every third-party game is necessarily doing this.

858
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:47,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic X Shadow Generations does not seem to have an upgrade pack.

859
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:55,439
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do not know how things like Hades 2, which is getting launched on Switch 1 and 2 at the same time, we don't know how that works yet.

860
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:01,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you would hope it's like the PlayStation 5 where you buy one, you get both, but I just, I don't think that's how it's going to work.

861
01:18:03,423 --> 01:18:07,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see how other third-party games are handled soon.

862
01:18:09,423 --> 01:18:13,105
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTutsi in chat says, I'm still miffed Sega wouldn't do it for Puyo Tetris 2.

863
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Unintentional genius that I never bought Puyo Tetris 2.

864
01:18:18,008 --> 01:18:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one, but I never bought two.

865
01:18:20,009 --> 01:18:23,331
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I can get it for the Switch 2 and go, it's a good thing I never bought it for Switch 1.

866
01:18:25,132 --> 01:18:27,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what else on the Nintendo front, Loki?

867
01:18:29,175 --> 01:18:41,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo won't... I mean, not that this is surprising, but basically saying that they're not committing to the Switch staying $450 in North America after launch.

868
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:43,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Or at least in the United States.

869
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:45,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Duh.

870
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we literally don't know what... We don't know what tariffs are going to be tomorrow.

871
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:50,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, I mean...

872
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, duh.

873
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:57,218
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's going to piss everybody off or at least going to piss me off.

874
01:18:57,258 --> 01:18:57,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

875
01:18:57,558 --> 01:19:00,540
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some people out there that think everything that's happening is wonderful and great.

876
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,722
[SPEAKER_02]: But like there's still going to be tariffs.

877
01:19:04,202 --> 01:19:05,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.

878
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:08,505
[SPEAKER_02]: There are still going to be tariffs and it is still going to be pitched as a win.

879
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:13,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And this cost is going to get handed down to you and people are going to be like, yeah, but it's not as bad as it was.

880
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:22,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like how they slowly increase the price of gas to get us to go, wow, $4 a gallon of gas is really cheap.

881
01:19:22,293 --> 01:19:26,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to be so crazy when those tariffs go away and the prices stay the same.

882
01:19:26,915 --> 01:19:28,596
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be nuts.

883
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,818
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just like, oh, there's only a 30% tariff on China now.

884
01:19:33,038 --> 01:19:33,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Only?

885
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:47,369
[SPEAKER_06]: for now until you know and then or he'll like start demanding that Walmart eats the tariff price which I love to see how that finishes can't wait to see how that one finishes

886
01:19:48,171 --> 01:19:48,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, wait a second.

887
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:49,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait.

888
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:53,233
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that they have to pay more?

889
01:19:53,613 --> 01:19:56,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that the country that they're importing from paid more.

890
01:19:56,974 --> 01:19:57,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

891
01:19:57,454 --> 01:19:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: My argument's breaking down.

892
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:06,257
[SPEAKER_02]: If he is saying we don't need billionaires at the top of the organizations, you should be eating that wealth.

893
01:20:06,497 --> 01:20:08,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be taking it out of your pay.

894
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:10,739
[SPEAKER_02]: We should not have billionaires in this country.

895
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is the reason why he's saying this...

896
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,243
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, I never knew the unintentional genius behind all of this.

897
01:20:19,303 --> 01:20:19,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.

898
01:20:19,883 --> 01:20:21,044
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not what he's saying.

899
01:20:21,224 --> 01:20:22,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee it.

900
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:28,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but he basically just doesn't want to look negative on him.

901
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever.

902
01:20:29,809 --> 01:20:30,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

903
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:32,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, yes.

904
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:33,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, blame anybody but yourself.

905
01:20:34,031 --> 01:20:35,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worked the rest of your life.

906
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why shouldn't it work now?

907
01:20:36,772 --> 01:20:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no guarantee that they're going to stay at that price, obviously, because of tariffs.

908
01:20:41,255 --> 01:20:42,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a duh.

909
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:43,157
[SPEAKER_06]: No kidding.

910
01:20:43,857 --> 01:20:51,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's saying also that the PlayStation 5 price hikes are possible as well as it faces tariffs

911
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,711
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.

912
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:56,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, duh.

913
01:20:57,172 --> 01:20:58,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's a ticking time bomb.

914
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: The $1,000 PlayStation.

915
01:21:00,993 --> 01:21:08,516
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm curious about is, okay, if the China thing got adjusted, does that mean the Xbox thing is going to come down?

916
01:21:10,736 --> 01:21:12,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect it to come down as far as it was.

917
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:14,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see them doing that.

918
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:18,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a mid-generation dropping the prices like they used to.

919
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:19,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see them doing that.

920
01:21:19,822 --> 01:21:22,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be necessarily... But not the $80 game.

921
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,706
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not the $80 game.

922
01:21:24,726 --> 01:21:26,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course not, because they're making money off that.

923
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:32,511
[SPEAKER_06]: But I could see they're not going to lose money on these consoles, so obviously they're going to raise the prices for them.

924
01:21:34,493 --> 01:21:35,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't see how...

925
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:37,706
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on.

926
01:22:02,588 --> 01:22:02,768
[SPEAKER_06]: This is...

927
01:22:32,051 --> 01:22:33,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they may have to pivot.

928
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:02,299
[SPEAKER_02]: We have games still coming out on PlayStation 4.

929
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:04,320
[SPEAKER_02]: That Capcom Fighting Collection.

930
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, you're basically emulating, you know, Dreamcast and PS2 games.

931
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:15,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, that came out on PlayStation 4 and last generation's Xbox, as well as PlayStation 5 and so forth.

932
01:23:15,765 --> 01:23:20,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still games releasing on what is now last gen's hardware.

933
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:24,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to absolutely still continue to be the same for Switch.

934
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,971
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while.

935
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Switch is really going to start to get locked out.

936
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: The original Switch is going to really start to get locked out by third parties that are like, we have to really scale down these games to release on the original Switch.

937
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:39,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of that depends on Switch 2 sales, I think.

938
01:23:40,925 --> 01:23:41,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

939
01:23:42,386 --> 01:23:51,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time when we didn't have $80 game prices, but people showing you magazine ads from back in the day will try to make you think it.

940
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the classic game of the week.

941
01:23:54,211 --> 01:23:55,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's roll the bumper for that now.

942
01:24:06,385 --> 01:24:13,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

943
01:24:14,153 --> 01:24:16,615
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

944
01:24:17,611 --> 01:24:19,112
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

945
01:24:38,126 --> 01:24:43,749
[SPEAKER_02]: This game existed on just about every 1980s computing system out there.

946
01:24:44,089 --> 01:24:48,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to show you, for those watching live on Twitch, I'm going to show you the Macintosh version of it.

947
01:24:48,892 --> 01:24:52,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, it was actually one of the better looking versions of this because it came out later.

948
01:24:52,594 --> 01:24:54,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this version came out in 87.

949
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:55,776
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're probably wondering, what game?

950
01:24:55,796 --> 01:24:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: What game?

951
01:24:56,536 --> 01:24:58,978
[SPEAKER_02]: The game I've picked tonight as Classic Game of the Week is...

952
01:24:59,798 --> 01:25:01,979
[SPEAKER_02]: PINBALL CONSTRUCTION SET

953
01:25:20,786 --> 01:25:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It originally came out in 1982 for the Apple II.

954
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:31,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it came out later on with ports for Atari's 8-bit collection of computers.

955
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:34,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the version that I remember, you know, of course, was the Commodore 64.

956
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:40,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It was released by Electronic Arts, which used to be ECA, but now they're just EA.

957
01:25:41,155 --> 01:25:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But Electronic Arts, yep, they existed all that time ago.

958
01:25:44,316 --> 01:25:45,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And the game was released.

959
01:25:45,597 --> 01:25:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually called on the box DarkSakura.

960
01:25:47,938 --> 01:25:56,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill Budge pinball construction set because Bill Budge was the individual who actually created this game by the way he's retired now

961
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,766
[SPEAKER_02]: He made other games like Raster Blaster he made on the Apple II.

962
01:26:03,807 --> 01:26:13,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he wrote a game I think called Mouse Paint, which was very – but he pretty much – he worked for the 3DO for a little bit, worked on Blade Force and then ended up fading out of the game industry.

963
01:26:13,357 --> 01:26:18,463
[SPEAKER_02]: But Pinball Construction Set I think was huge and a really incredible contribution to the industry.

964
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this game, you build a pinball table.

965
01:26:21,445 --> 01:26:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have all the parts on the right side of the screen, and then you have an empty pinball table on the left.

966
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:34,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, you can't really change the layout of the pinball table, which some would argue, well, that makes it a little... But you could still add your own ramps.

967
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:35,675
[SPEAKER_02]: You could add other things.

968
01:26:35,975 --> 01:26:38,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, the game was made in 1982.

969
01:26:38,457 --> 01:26:42,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the time that it came out, it was very damn impressive.

970
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: What was also really neat about this was that with some of the ports...

971
01:26:47,643 --> 01:26:48,484
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

972
01:27:10,496 --> 01:27:21,662
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh I could put that on a disc and I could go give that to Loki and he could play the game without necessarily needing to even have pinball construction set which is really cool so um

973
01:27:23,345 --> 01:27:27,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, again, Bill Budge made this game originally for the Apple II.

974
01:27:27,869 --> 01:27:35,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, he didn't really want to write another game, but he started kind of experimenting with game tools and graphic tools.

975
01:27:36,477 --> 01:27:46,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the process involved him actually purchasing and disassembling an old Target Alpha pinball machine made by Gottlieb.

976
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,048
[SPEAKER_02]: from back in the day.

977
01:27:48,469 --> 01:27:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wanted to actually take some of the components from that and sort of like accurately depict it in this sort of... See, and we're looking at the Mac version being played.

978
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:58,900
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mac version had extra shit because it came out later.

979
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:04,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it actually had skins for the pinball table and like cool things that didn't exist in the original version of the game.

980
01:28:04,906 --> 01:28:07,849
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just made it even that much better, honestly.

981
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:08,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

982
01:28:10,131 --> 01:28:10,952
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

983
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:45,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill, even if you didn't care for video games and what have you, I think you made a hell of a contribution to the industry with this, just in the sense of the whole build your own thing and let other people explore the thing, which I think so much of gaming is now these days, and you really see the cool stuff in games.

984
01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:50,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you didn't have to have this game in order to play it on another system was just...

985
01:28:51,289 --> 01:28:51,970
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just awesome.

986
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So what a great contribution.

987
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:58,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Construction Set, it came out and it sold over a quarter of a million copies.

988
01:28:58,736 --> 01:29:05,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, ultimately 300,000 copies by the time the 90s when we kind of look at like a final sales figure for this game.

989
01:29:06,443 --> 01:29:09,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So some other accolades for this game.

990
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:17,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Wozniak, you recognize this one of the names behind Apple, said it is, quote, the greatest program ever written for an 8-bit machine.

991
01:29:17,993 --> 01:29:27,341
[SPEAKER_02]: and mentioning that for many people, this was their first sort of experience with a GUI or graphical user interface, right?

992
01:29:27,401 --> 01:29:37,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Computer Gaming World in 1983 said it was a revolutionary software toy and easy to understand because of the icons and the drag and drop and all that other stuff that came with the game.

993
01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:45,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The nine-page manual that it came with was actually considered overkill by some because you didn't need programming knowledge to make this work.

994
01:29:46,555 --> 01:29:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, they mention in here an eight-year-old had no problems creating his own tables.

995
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm living proof.

996
01:29:52,778 --> 01:29:58,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I was that eight-year-old playing this game because I had a Commodore 64 when I was five.

997
01:29:58,321 --> 01:30:02,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think by the time I was seven, I think we finally kind of got this game on the Commodore 64.

998
01:30:02,724 --> 01:30:05,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I was able to make simple pinball tables.

999
01:30:05,165 --> 01:30:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they probably weren't very fun.

1000
01:30:07,006 --> 01:30:10,967
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were, they were pinball tables, which is pretty, pretty amazing.

1001
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:14,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some other releases of this game.

1002
01:30:14,848 --> 01:30:19,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, uh, we had a Coleco Adam version that was planned.

1003
01:30:19,769 --> 01:30:24,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to be a dual release with a hard hat Mac that was supposed to be the best of electronic arts.

1004
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:29,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never released, but there's footage out there online that you can actually find, uh, of this.

1005
01:30:29,571 --> 01:30:29,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm

1006
01:30:33,152 --> 01:30:34,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1007
01:30:50,683 --> 01:30:57,785
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 29 pre-made tables in the game, or you could design your own using the in-game editor tools, and then it had the themes and all that stuff.

1008
01:30:57,825 --> 01:31:05,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So Virtual Pinball was essentially a souped-up version of this, it's just you couldn't really trade around or anything, which is what made this game kind of legendary back in the day.

1009
01:31:06,106 --> 01:31:09,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I see some of you in chat, I think, brought this game up, and yes, it is related.

1010
01:31:09,987 --> 01:31:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Pinball on Genesis was a version of this.

1011
01:31:12,928 --> 01:31:13,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1012
01:31:15,322 --> 01:31:15,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1013
01:31:15,682 --> 01:31:18,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And PodCulture was saying a modern version of this could be cool.

1014
01:31:19,005 --> 01:31:26,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bobby Blackwell points out it's called Virtual Pinball X. Jay Helinski points out it sounds like OG Roblox.

1015
01:31:26,913 --> 01:31:27,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

1016
01:31:27,453 --> 01:31:30,916
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I... Yeah, Bobby says Virtual Pinball X does not equal Virtual Pinball.

1017
01:31:30,976 --> 01:31:31,397
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't.

1018
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:34,740
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you think there might be some reasoning behind the name?

1019
01:31:37,022 --> 01:31:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's kind of that.

1020
01:31:38,023 --> 01:31:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway...

1021
01:31:40,382 --> 01:31:42,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Helinski says, sounds like OG Roblox.

1022
01:31:43,024 --> 01:31:47,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's what I'm talking about with the whole, like, build your own game and now publish your own game and that whole thing.

1023
01:31:47,907 --> 01:31:50,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think Pinball Construction Set is really a root.

1024
01:31:50,348 --> 01:31:53,770
[SPEAKER_02]: There were other construction sets that ended up being released.

1025
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:56,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I had a music construction set.

1026
01:31:56,892 --> 01:32:00,734
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, I think, one called Deconstruction Set that was a racing game.

1027
01:32:01,034 --> 01:32:04,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was like, you know, it's supposed to be like monster trucks, deconstructors.

1028
01:32:04,776 --> 01:32:05,677
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a thing, too.

1029
01:32:06,638 --> 01:32:07,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1030
01:32:08,118 --> 01:32:08,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1031
01:32:09,119 --> 01:32:10,080
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1032
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:33,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Budge released the source code to the Atari 8-bit version.

1033
01:32:34,066 --> 01:32:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: He released it on GitHub under the MIT license.

1034
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:41,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to go check that out, you can get it.

1035
01:32:42,489 --> 01:32:46,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was, okay, and some of the other titles are linked here.

1036
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:49,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Music Construction Set, Adventure Construction Set.

1037
01:32:50,452 --> 01:32:51,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I never played that one.

1038
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:52,452
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds really cool.

1039
01:32:52,592 --> 01:32:54,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that was like an old school RPG maker.

1040
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:55,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I never played that one.

1041
01:32:56,033 --> 01:32:58,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Racing Destruction Set was the other one I was trying to think of.

1042
01:33:00,335 --> 01:33:03,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Were all kind of those games, but I don't think Bill Budge had anything to do with the others.

1043
01:33:03,316 --> 01:33:05,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was more of a publishing label thing.

1044
01:33:05,656 --> 01:33:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Will Harvey made Music Construction Set.

1045
01:33:07,857 --> 01:33:10,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a publishing label thing, but I'll tell you what,

1046
01:33:13,083 --> 01:33:17,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Construction Set, one of my fave, fave, fave games as a kid.

1047
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:21,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons I love pinball as much as I do.

1048
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:23,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think this is a great title.

1049
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:25,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad y'all could learn about this game.

1050
01:33:26,493 --> 01:33:29,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you, you love these type of make your own game things.

1051
01:33:29,155 --> 01:33:32,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know ZZT, when I throw it back to that, you get excited too.

1052
01:33:32,578 --> 01:33:33,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play this at all?

1053
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:34,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinball Construction Set?

1054
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:34,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not.

1055
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:35,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't?

1056
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a bummer.

1057
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

1058
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:38,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wow.

1059
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:42,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at the Mac version, there's so much more with the Mac version you could do than the other ones.

1060
01:33:43,223 --> 01:33:43,983
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting.

1061
01:33:44,023 --> 01:33:44,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that.

1062
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was the last, essentially the last one outside of the virtual pinball on Genesis that was released.

1063
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, there you go.

1064
01:33:52,086 --> 01:33:54,667
[SPEAKER_02]: My classic game of the week, pinball construction set.

1065
01:33:54,727 --> 01:33:57,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I know I've brought this up on OLR before.

1066
01:33:57,128 --> 01:34:00,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just kind of like tangentially about the make your own game things.

1067
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:02,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember a game like that when I was a kid.

1068
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's officially recognized as a game of the week.

1069
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:05,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1070
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:13,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and also an acknowledgement to DarkSakura and the Pinball Festival she's at right now.

1071
01:34:14,575 --> 01:34:21,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she's there tonight, but I think she's recovering a bit, but still at this weekend that we'll hear more about next week.

1072
01:34:21,817 --> 01:34:23,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's get into some other headlines.

1073
01:34:23,597 --> 01:34:25,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, let's go back to you for some rapid fire news.

1074
01:34:26,511 --> 01:34:29,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so we got a cool tease of Fallout Season 2.

1075
01:34:29,612 --> 01:34:36,073
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on Amazon at the end of this year, I think in December.

1076
01:34:36,453 --> 01:34:44,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as they tease at the end of Season 1 of New Vegas, they go into more of that as well.

1077
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:46,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is going to take place in New Vegas.

1078
01:34:47,295 --> 01:34:48,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excited to see this.

1079
01:34:48,495 --> 01:34:51,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's already been picked up for Season 3 as well, so...

1080
01:34:52,417 --> 01:34:54,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to checking that out.

1081
01:34:55,099 --> 01:35:04,466
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have news that a Lego Bionicle fan game has been given the cease and desist.

1082
01:35:04,526 --> 01:35:10,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Lego Group has basically told them to take it offline and erase its existence.

1083
01:35:12,192 --> 01:35:13,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been in development for eight years.

1084
01:35:13,853 --> 01:35:18,217
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, actually, at one point, I think that the Lego team had actually seen

1085
01:35:19,177 --> 01:35:48,227
[SPEAKER_06]: The progress of it or whatever and still kind of gave them the go ahead but now for whatever reason though they've had to shut it down so that was a game called Bionicle Massive Power and what's going to happen now is I believe that the team is going to, first off they're changing the name because they were team Kanoe which I think ties back to Bionicle so now they're just Unmasked Games and they're going to repurpose it into its own like IP so basically not throwing away all the development that they've done on it but

1086
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:49,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Reskin it.

1087
01:35:49,228 --> 01:35:55,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of similar to what they did with that whole racing game that they put on the PlayStation 1.

1088
01:35:57,013 --> 01:35:57,434
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1089
01:35:57,534 --> 01:35:58,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Dark Souls.

1090
01:35:58,455 --> 01:36:02,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the name of it.

1091
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:04,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Bloodborne racing game.

1092
01:36:04,999 --> 01:36:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloodborne, yes.

1093
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:06,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1094
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:06,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Bloodborne, yes.

1095
01:36:07,241 --> 01:36:08,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bloodborne racing game.

1096
01:36:09,683 --> 01:36:10,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar to that.

1097
01:36:10,524 --> 01:36:13,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going to just repurpose it into its own game, I think.

1098
01:36:15,165 --> 01:36:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1099
01:36:36,929 --> 01:36:57,892
[SPEAKER_02]: of the original Metal Gear and you can tell this is the MSX version of Metal Gear because the opening moments are straight in that first building and not the whole sequence that the NES version opens up with but yeah you can actually download this from itch.io and apparently it will actually run on a Genesis or what they call a Mr. device and of course emulators uh

1100
01:36:58,012 --> 01:36:58,392
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

1101
01:37:22,188 --> 01:37:25,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really cool.

1102
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:27,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to play this, to be honest.

1103
01:37:27,230 --> 01:37:28,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.

1104
01:37:28,331 --> 01:37:38,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a way to experience the MSX version, but on a platform more of us in the States are familiar with, being the fact that we had a Mega Drive here as the Genesis.

1105
01:37:38,676 --> 01:37:39,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks smooth.

1106
01:37:39,696 --> 01:37:40,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great.

1107
01:37:40,357 --> 01:37:40,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

1108
01:37:41,377 --> 01:37:42,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right.

1120
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:24,392

1134
01:40:50,663 --> 01:40:58,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty busy week in Japan on the Switch, but I think that's because we were coming off a couple weeks where it was a little slow, and now we're ramping up towards the Switch 2 release.

1135
01:40:58,608 --> 01:40:59,729

01:42:58,666 --> 01:42:59,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks awesome.

1164
01:42:59,407 --> 01:42:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.

1165
01:42:59,987 --> 01:43:00,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1166
01:43:01,088 --> 01:43:01,368
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1167
01:43:01,869 --> 01:43:04,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We have just another quick news story here, and then we're going to get to our listener roundtable.

1168
01:43:04,891 --> 01:43:06,813
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have an email tonight we're going to get into.

1169
01:43:07,153 --> 01:43:09,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into some posts from Blue Sky you sent us as well.

1170
01:43:10,176 --> 01:43:11,677
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a pretty packed listener roundtable.

1171
01:43:11,697 --> 01:43:16,662
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if we can fit in a call or two as well if you want to join our green room over at the VOG Network Discord.

1172
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:18,523
[SPEAKER_02]: vognetwork.com.discord.

1173
01:43:18,543 --> 01:43:20,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be taking those a little later in the show.

1174
01:43:20,465 --> 01:43:24,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's get to the last thing we have here tonight, Loki.

1175
01:43:25,205 --> 01:43:41,416
[SPEAKER_06]: so we have a game that's been cancelled and a new game so a game that has been cancelled Kingdom Hearts The Missing Link which began development back in 2019 if you don't remember what that game was apparently it was going to be a Pokemon Go style mobile spin-off of Kingdom Hearts

1176
01:43:42,176 --> 01:44:02,222
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just was cancelled because of quality over quantity as an AR gaming fan I was really like interested to see what they were going to bring to the table but if it was not great I'm kind of glad they cancelled it I'm glad they recognized because a lot of AR game knockoffs have been not great Garfield Go not good not good

1177
01:44:03,212 --> 01:44:04,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm shocked, I'm shocked.

1178
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:17,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, along with that, of course, they announced that Kingdom Hearts 4 is coming as well, and they showed off some screenshots, which, I have to say, I'm not exactly thrilled of the art direction of it.

1179
01:44:18,019 --> 01:44:31,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little more Final Fantasy 15, 16 versus Kingdom Hearts because it's going that more realistic route and less of the, you know, kind of cartoony style that they used to have.

1180
01:44:34,325 --> 01:44:56,625
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah according to the social media posts to our Kingdom Hearts community we're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts 4 and we'll continue pouring ourselves into the game development we're dedicated to making this experience that lives up to your expectations we've seen how excited you are and truly grateful for the bottom of our hearts and yada yada yada and that game will come out when it comes out it'll come out when it comes out later on

1181
01:44:57,285 --> 01:44:59,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, like I said, I'm not excited about the art direction.

1182
01:44:59,706 --> 01:45:04,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish they would have kept that same style because it just looks off.

1183
01:45:07,408 --> 01:45:08,128
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1184
01:45:08,749 --> 01:45:09,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And he can play as Mickey.

1185
01:45:10,949 --> 01:45:12,030
[SPEAKER_06]: According to screenshots.

1186
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1187
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:14,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be interesting.

1188
01:45:15,811 --> 01:45:18,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess we haven't been able to do that in the franchise before, huh?

1189
01:45:19,352 --> 01:45:19,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1190
01:45:20,132 --> 01:45:20,532
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.

1191
01:45:20,552 --> 01:45:21,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played enough Kingdom Hearts.

1192
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:24,734
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so, because he was always kind of there.

1193
01:45:24,814 --> 01:45:26,014
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, interesting.

1194
01:45:27,011 --> 01:45:29,592
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go to the listener roundtable.

1195
01:45:29,672 --> 01:45:34,613
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take your emails, your calls, your blue sky posts.

1196
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:35,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1197
01:45:35,753 --> 01:45:42,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have an email tonight coming to us from Rin Mari, who was not able to make the show tonight, but wants to send along this email.

1198
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:43,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the email, Rin Mari.

1199
01:45:43,496 --> 01:45:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would like to send us an email in the future, please consider participate at orange.com.

1200
01:45:48,797 --> 01:45:49,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us your thoughts.

1201
01:45:50,378 --> 01:45:51,098
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me, Mari.

1202
01:45:51,658 --> 01:45:54,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about sports games and why I think they're kind of interesting.

1203
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:08,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, before I jump into the email, not all sports games are necessarily bad.

1204
01:46:08,735 --> 01:46:13,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a soft spot in my heart for Blades of Steel, you know, and some of the old school.

1205
01:46:13,476 --> 01:46:17,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the more cartoony, the more older, like Tecmo Bowl and stuff I used to love.

1206
01:46:18,637 --> 01:46:19,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I love a good racing game.

1207
01:46:19,957 --> 01:46:28,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if I think that sports games are necessarily bad, but I understand we do dog on the Madden roster update and sorts of things.

1208
01:46:28,278 --> 01:46:30,039
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, let me jump back into the email.

1209
01:46:30,939 --> 01:46:30,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1210
01:46:31,997 --> 01:46:38,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Ranmari continues, like, yes, there's the annual update games that people like to meme on, like the Madden and FIFA series, right?

1211
01:46:38,781 --> 01:46:39,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Called out.

1212
01:46:39,781 --> 01:46:54,070
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's the silly-looking but also have a lot of depth sports games, like the Mario Tennis series and Hot Shots Golf, games where the devs can focus more on making a quality game because they're not beholden to updating non-fictional character stats to reflect their real-life counterparts.

1213
01:46:55,006 --> 01:46:55,426
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1214
01:47:17,867 --> 01:47:23,210
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my friends around the same political spectrum as me remarked that we should ban golf to piss off rich people.

1215
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:26,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can think of one that would be particularly pissed, Ranmari.

1216
01:47:27,032 --> 01:47:27,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you who it is.

1217
01:47:28,072 --> 01:47:33,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somebody who spends a lot of days where they ought to be doing their fucking job out playing golf at Mar-a-Lago.

1218
01:47:33,855 --> 01:47:41,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, also there's alternatives to traditional golf like Topgolf, which is basically a driving range with bowling-like gameplay, and Minigolf.

1219
01:47:41,702 --> 01:47:44,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They're building a second one of those Topgolfs in Sacramento.

1220
01:47:44,444 --> 01:47:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know that, Loki.

1221
01:47:45,845 --> 01:47:48,568
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the one out in Roseville, and they're building a second one on the west side of town.

1222
01:47:49,048 --> 01:47:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.

1223
01:47:49,749 --> 01:47:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1224
01:47:50,849 --> 01:47:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, um...

1225
01:47:52,891 --> 01:48:02,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the time I started listening to this show in 2006, I also got into an MMO game called Pangaea, then known as Albatross 18 in Not Asia.

1226
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:03,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I remember Albatross 18, okay.

1227
01:48:04,339 --> 01:48:15,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And that took up a lot of my free time going into my university years, being a great way to be social with friends and games, but without having to put the chat away for extended periods of time due to extremely sweaty action-based gameplay.

1228
01:48:15,566 --> 01:48:18,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your shot, and while you wait for everyone else to take their turn, shoot the shit.

1229
01:48:19,209 --> 01:48:22,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do a tournament and enjoy a 30-person chat room with a golf course in it.

1230
01:48:22,951 --> 01:48:40,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, Pangaea shut down some time ago, and I have yet to see anything like it really fill the void.

1231
01:48:40,696 --> 01:48:50,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there's golf games with online components, like the newer Mario Golf games, but they really lack that social aspect that made Pangaea such an addictive experience, and often have really short sessions.

1232
01:48:55,221 --> 01:49:00,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my takeaway from this is game industry, give us a new MMO golf game, please.

1233
01:49:01,303 --> 01:49:04,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to take me away from being sweaty at Tactical Nexus.

1234
01:49:04,544 --> 01:49:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 200 hours into that game, and I still don't know what I'm doing.

1235
01:49:08,226 --> 01:49:09,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Strongers are waiting.

1236
01:49:09,366 --> 01:49:11,007
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole sentence is crossed out, by the way.

1237
01:49:11,747 --> 01:49:26,378
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways have a great show I'll catch you folks another Sunday well we appreciate the email and yeah I think there's a lot of you know when I think of like sports games that are really interesting I like to think of ones that really just kind of like mix up like you know what one of my favorite sports games is Kirby Miniature Golf

1238
01:49:27,299 --> 01:49:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: on the Super Nintendo.

1239
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:28,640
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that?

1240
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,502
[SPEAKER_02]: The one where Kirby turned into a golf.

1241
01:49:31,582 --> 01:49:34,544
[SPEAKER_02]: It was maybe I'm butchering the name of it.

1242
01:49:34,824 --> 01:49:35,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream Course.

1243
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:35,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream Course.

1244
01:49:35,925 --> 01:49:36,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1245
01:49:36,205 --> 01:49:37,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was Kirby's Dream Course.

1246
01:49:37,727 --> 01:49:39,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like miniature golf, but Kirby.

1247
01:49:39,928 --> 01:49:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, you would have the different angled shots and Kirby was like a little golf ball.

1248
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:46,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really fun and cute.

1249
01:49:46,613 --> 01:49:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't I certainly don't hate like I was saying earlier, I don't hate all sports games, but I think you're right.

1250
01:49:51,476 --> 01:49:56,440
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the roster update, hyper realistic stuff just gets a little it's just a little much.

1251
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,002
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, you know, there's just too much that goes into it.

1252
01:50:01,122 --> 01:50:03,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it when it was NBA Jam.

1253
01:50:03,143 --> 01:50:05,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump, shoot, easy.

1254
01:50:07,325 --> 01:50:18,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But you make some valid points when it comes to being able to enjoy a sport that, you know, for whatever reasonability or what have you, you might not be able to, or maybe just lack of people you know that play it could be a big reason for that.

1255
01:50:18,551 --> 01:50:19,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about it.

1256
01:50:20,851 --> 01:50:22,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Could dancing be considered a sport?

1257
01:50:22,833 --> 01:50:37,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we all met playing DDR and I realized a lot of the topics we would discuss back in the day had to do with DDR getting recognized as an Olympic sport or the notion to try to get it recognized at the Olympics or as an X Games or whatever the fuck was going on back in the day.

1258
01:50:38,726 --> 01:50:41,388
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would consider DDR was kind of a sports game.

1259
01:50:41,488 --> 01:50:42,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

1260
01:50:42,629 --> 01:50:43,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

1261
01:50:45,192 --> 01:50:46,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Skate or Die a sports game?

1262
01:50:46,733 --> 01:50:47,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it kinda is.

1263
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:49,329
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a lot of fun.

1264
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer games, summer games and summer games too.

1265
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:54,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the shit out of those games on my Commodore 64.

1266
01:50:54,371 --> 01:50:55,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Winter games, another one too.

1267
01:50:56,112 --> 01:50:58,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of fun sports games out there.

1268
01:50:58,653 --> 01:51:04,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just the stuff that gets like really, really in the weeds realistic just goes over my head because I don't watch a lot of it on TV.

1269
01:51:04,936 --> 01:51:06,537
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cartoony ones are great.

1270
01:51:07,937 --> 01:51:08,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, thanks for the email.

1271
01:51:08,918 --> 01:51:09,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

1272
01:51:10,638 --> 01:51:14,160
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's head over to Blue Sky.

1273
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, are there some sports games that you enjoy?

1274
01:51:18,993 --> 01:51:19,153
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1275
01:51:21,055 --> 01:51:25,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I sort of used to button mash NFL Blitz.

1276
01:51:26,561 --> 01:51:27,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that works.

1277
01:51:28,543 --> 01:51:31,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really gotten to NBA Jam.

1278
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Racing games are always fun.

1279
01:51:34,630 --> 01:51:34,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1280
01:51:37,062 --> 01:51:40,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well we asked this question to our listeners this week on Blue Sky.

1281
01:51:40,824 --> 01:51:42,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few answers I'd like to share with you.

1282
01:51:42,965 --> 01:51:51,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, for our listener roundtable tonight, DarkSakura has talked about a local pinball show in Lodi she likes to attend.

1283
01:51:51,069 --> 01:51:52,470
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Golden State Pinball Festival.

1284
01:51:54,091 --> 01:51:56,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite local gaming show that you like to go to?

1285
01:51:57,572 --> 01:52:00,374
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes this expo, convention, or show special for you?

1286
01:52:01,365 --> 01:52:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's read some of your answers.

1287
01:52:03,146 --> 01:52:07,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Rite says the only convention I go to annually is California Extreme.

1288
01:52:08,047 --> 01:52:09,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to see when that is this year.

1289
01:52:09,808 --> 01:52:12,029
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the dates for California Extreme this year?

1290
01:52:12,049 --> 01:52:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's got to be coming up.

1291
01:52:13,349 --> 01:52:14,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be in July.

1292
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Better not be the same weekend as Southern Fried.

1293
01:52:16,970 --> 01:52:17,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it would be though.

1294
01:52:17,911 --> 01:52:20,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be later because it's usually July or August.

1295
01:52:21,012 --> 01:52:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to go.

1296
01:52:22,092 --> 01:52:25,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the only convention I go to annually is California Extreme.

1297
01:52:25,376 --> 01:52:32,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of great arcade games, there's usually a good rhythm game section, and there's lots of curiosities like Billy Bowl, Panic Park, and Prop Cycle.

1298
01:52:33,064 --> 01:52:36,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Have been going since the 2010s, which was probably the last time I went.

1299
01:52:37,188 --> 01:52:46,271
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkDetsuya says, I wish we had one closer enough to us to go, but the last thing that was closest to gaming was the two years of WonderCon that I went to with my brother.

1300
01:52:46,932 --> 01:52:53,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Nintendo and Capcom did have boosts with their upcoming games, so I suppose it at least partially counts.

1301
01:52:53,694 --> 01:52:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, whatever speaks to you, DarkDetsuya.

1302
01:52:55,575 --> 01:52:56,575
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no right or wrong answer.

1303
01:52:57,595 --> 01:53:01,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Bryguy2365 on Blue Sky replies to us and says,

1304
01:53:02,665 --> 01:53:09,028
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends and I like going to too many games just outside of Philly every year.

1305
01:53:09,068 --> 01:53:09,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of this one.

1306
01:53:10,429 --> 01:53:12,429
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been going for the last 10 years or so.

1307
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:16,731
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the few times we can go and forget about the real world for a weekend.

1308
01:53:17,232 --> 01:53:19,293
[SPEAKER_02]: All while celebrating our love of video games.

1309
01:53:19,553 --> 01:53:22,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet YYR at too many games once as well.

1310
01:53:22,414 --> 01:53:23,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I've heard of it.

1311
01:53:23,655 --> 01:53:25,055
[SPEAKER_02]: YYR went to that once.

1312
01:53:25,295 --> 01:53:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1313
01:53:26,056 --> 01:53:27,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have friends out of that area too.

1314
01:53:27,556 --> 01:53:29,577
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I remember when YYR was plugging that show.

1315
01:53:29,837 --> 01:53:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome you guys got to meet.

1316
01:53:31,963 --> 01:53:32,644
[SPEAKER_02]: AJ Twist Evo

1317
01:53:52,327 --> 01:54:18,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those answers and I'm going to tell you some of my secret reason why I was asking that question was that I'm like if there is a convention I should be going to that I'm not going to I kind of want to know about it so maybe I need to put that on my radar actually should be a thing that I probably want to think about doing because I want to go to more conventions I want to try to get on more panels and have fun and do that type of stuff I think it would be fun

1318
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:22,181
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple, I will say there's actually an expo in LA I'm looking into.

1319
01:54:22,402 --> 01:54:24,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So more to come on that if I actually end up going.

1320
01:54:26,884 --> 01:54:27,504
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1321
01:54:29,185 --> 01:54:31,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks in chat participating as well.

1322
01:54:31,085 --> 01:54:34,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby Blackwell says, California Extreme is July 19th through 20th.

1323
01:54:35,067 --> 01:54:37,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the weekend Southern Pride game would have been.

1324
01:54:38,108 --> 01:54:41,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Aha, that's why I remember those days conflicting before.

1325
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:43,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that doesn't matter now.

1326
01:54:43,211 --> 01:54:47,513
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's July 19th this year, that might work out a lot better for me.

1327
01:54:49,611 --> 01:54:52,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm free that weekend.

1328
01:54:53,276 --> 01:54:54,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to make that happen.

1329
01:54:54,157 --> 01:54:54,658
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

1330
01:54:56,820 --> 01:54:57,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

1331
01:54:58,122 --> 01:55:04,850
[SPEAKER_02]: PodCulture says there's a really cool pinball place in Terre Haute, Indiana that I've been to a few times on my way to and from Illinois.

1332
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:06,833
[SPEAKER_02]: ICC and Indy is a big one.

1333
01:55:08,448 --> 01:55:08,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1334
01:55:09,649 --> 01:55:10,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1335
01:55:10,829 --> 01:55:13,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you for sharing those answers with us.

1336
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

1337
01:55:15,031 --> 01:55:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, we don't have any calls waiting, so let's check in with Loki for any last minute stories.

1338
01:55:21,033 --> 01:55:22,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last minute stories for us tonight, Loki?

1339
01:55:23,454 --> 01:55:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the exclusive Garfield Cart 2 All You Can Drift has been leaked by the Australian Rating Board.

1340
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:34,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're all excited.

1341
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget that Mario Kart, you know,

1342
01:55:38,224 --> 01:55:40,994
[SPEAKER_06]: World, it's all about Garfield Kart 2.

1343
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:46,793
[SPEAKER_02]: S21100 Matt in chat says, I thought Ranma was going to call in from Japan.

1344
01:55:46,853 --> 01:55:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I remember him saying that, but let's be real.

1345
01:55:50,075 --> 01:55:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in Japan right now having fun, going out and doing shit.

1346
01:55:53,518 --> 01:56:01,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to have call OLR front of memory for me either unless I, well, if it was me, maybe I would because it's the show I'm on every week.

1347
01:56:01,723 --> 01:56:07,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But I fully expect Ranma is out there having a good time right now, maybe recovering from last night because it's more of the morning over there.

1348
01:56:08,608 --> 01:56:11,109
[SPEAKER_02]: He probably thought the show would be going until nine o'clock tonight, too.

1349
01:56:11,209 --> 01:56:13,190
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe he was hoping he'd call in a little later.

1350
01:56:13,571 --> 01:56:17,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know he made it because I've seen some of the updates on Facebook and all that good stuff.

1351
01:56:17,853 --> 01:56:21,014
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we'll just have to hear from Ranma how Japan is going.
