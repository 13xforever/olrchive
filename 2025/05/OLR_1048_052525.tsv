9662	11463	You got your PlayStation in my Xbox!
11623	20446	With Xbox's recently released Retro Classics library for Game Pass subscribers, a litany of DOS, SNES, Atari, Amiga, and PlayStation games arrived on Xbox and PCs everywhere with more to come.
20646	22687	Naturally, these games are played via a streamed connection.
22927	28049	Not that streamed games are novel at this point, though there is something strange about a keyboard plugged into a game console to play Zork.
28209	29809	This is the Activision Acquisition Headline.
29929	34851	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somers, and Loki to tell you more about Retro Classics and the Rear's of the Week's Gaming News.
35011	37052	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has a voice.
39997	42418	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42438	46060	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46180	48581	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48661	49482	We are live.
49542	50102	Hello, hello.
50222	57226	Once again, May the 25th of 2025 with episode number 1048 of our show.
57666	60387	Hope those of you in the States are having a good Memorial Day weekend.
60587	63189	But we're here to talk about video games as we usually do.
63289	64970	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week.
65430	69452	And my co-host, welcome back this week, the one and only Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
71815	72716	Welcome back!
73236	75597	How was Golden State Pinball Fest?
75778	76718	You had a good time there, right?
76738	79880	It was lots of fun and I played lots of stuff.
80120	82482	I got stuff for y'all.
82642	84643	I'll tell you during my gaming week.
84803	90667	I caught you on Blue Sky and then over on Twitch that you were doing some commentating for a little bit too, which I wasn't expecting.
91127	92128	Yes, I was.
93008	96710	I was commenting on the women's pinball tournament.
96791	96971	Mm-hmm.
98792	112107	and it was there were some mean tables they were rude the word of the night was rude that reminds me of that TikTok trend I don't know if you see it but there's that okay so you know they made Death Becomes Her a musical right yeah
112648	114029	So that's a big musical on Broadway right now.
114089	120112	And one of the songs, and I think it's right after the one, you know, Meryl Streep gets a hole blown inside.
120132	120993	Or no, was that Goldie Hawn?
121013	121253	I don't know.
121273	126075	One of them gets the shotgun, but obviously it's the... But she goes, that was rude.
126115	126876	That was Goldie Hawn.
127216	128857	That was pretty fucking rude.
129077	129777	It's really funny.
129997	134360	Like, you have to... I know you're not a big TikTok person, but it's these videos, like, I see them all the time.
134400	138522	I'm sure YouTube Shorts, Instagram, wherever, they all pull the same memes.
139002	139883	So, yeah.
140003	140623	Well, I...
143431	149540	The only one of those that I care about was Drag Becomes Her with Ben Dillacrim.
149560	150902	Oh, that looks like it would be fun.
150982	151523	I would have seen that.
151543	154227	I was third row watching that.
154247	154848	I would have seen that.
155623	162205	I was front row when they did Drop Dead Gorgeous with Pandora Box and Ben DeLaCreme was in that one too.
162225	162965	That was a lot of fun.
163285	165466	But anyway, let's see.
165586	166826	What else was I going to say here?
166986	172488	Oh, so you're doing the commentating and were you able to see the winner and all that good stuff?
172608	173828	Or was it still like the qualifiers?
173848	177029	I saw the winner, but I don't remember who it was because I just wasn't familiar with everybody.
177149	178270	But it was a really...
179210	181432	It was a really good tournament.
181452	185035	There was lots of skill, just the machines were not kind.
185416	186256	They were not kind.
186757	187237	Very rude.
188899	189379	Quite rude.
189399	191041	It was pretty fucking rude.
192081	196726	But I learned a lot about some of the intricacies of some of the older tables there, though.
196866	198767	And I have to say that I was...
200049	202892	Pretty impressed actually with the John Wick table.
202992	206756	It's a lot more fun than I thought it was the first time I played it.
207637	210441	But I'll tell you more about some of the tables I played at the con.
210481	215226	We actually brought in a prototype of the portal multimorphic table.
215426	216868	That's so cool that you have that.
217228	220851	It is now packaged up and ready to go back to the developer.
221832	224253	But it was pretty great.
224754	225054	Nice.
225855	226215	More later.
226895	228136	I'm sad I didn't get out there.
228156	232039	Our errands had backed up and we just didn't have time during the week to do them.
232079	233941	And I was like, eh, I'll live.
234141	235102	I'll be sad, but I'll live.
235682	236263	So, all right.
237384	240126	Let's get to the one and only Techmaster Loki is here tonight.
241006	241286	Hello.
241467	242087	Hi, Loki.
242267	242748	How are you doing?
243769	244289	I'm doing good.
244309	244810	Yeah.
245250	250153	I notice the game you have behind you because we are broadcasting live, of course, at Twitch Television.
250454	254216	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network, the Voice Geeks Network, VOG Network.
254256	261081	We broadcast live every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except plot twist.
261381	263182	There was no Bobby Blackwolf on tonight.
263783	267165	He was streaming on other parts of Twitch as they were doing speed runs.
267525	268446	I believe the twist is
268866	269527	Thanks for watching!
285340	292565	He was at MobileCon this weekend and so he wasn't able to be here live tonight, but I was following his blue sky and it looked like he was having a lot of fun.
292705	300830	So I don't blame him for taking the night off to enjoy the rest of MobileCon and whatever other antics he may be up to tonight, but he'll be back next week.
302131	312077	But Loki, as we are taping live, I noticed you have a game playing behind you here and it took me a minute to realize that's the Lilo and Stitch game that you have playing from like Game Boy Advance or something, right?
312217	313658	It is from Game Boy Advance, yeah.
313678	314078	So I have that.
314198	315018	Never played this.
315558	318579	I just, you know, we've done this show for like thousands of times.
318819	322620	And so it's... 1047 and then this is one more.
322680	322940	Yes.
324120	327461	Trying to think of new games to put behind me, you know, every time.
328422	331282	So I heard about this recently, I guess.
331702	333163	It was, I think, through Blue Sky.
333223	334623	Someone was posting like retro games.
335303	337764	And they were talking about how the game was kind of like a...
338894	346033	Metal Slug clone, which sounded cool to me, so I just thought I'd throw it up behind me since the movie just, live action remake just came out.
346894	347634	Yeah, I was curious.
347654	348335	Which I have not watched.
348415	351295	Okay, I was curious if you were playing that because you saw the live-action remake.
351315	352416	I have heard some garbage about the movie.
352536	356997	I'm so... I don't have much interest in a lot of these live-action remakes.
357157	360419	The live-action remakes, they're desperate.
360559	362959	They're screaming, we need more coin.
363099	365660	I just, I don't know if any of them I've seen have been good.
365940	368101	I damn near walked out of Beauty and the Beast at the beginning.
368221	369562	That opening scene was so terrible.
370062	372803	But then it grew on me as it went on, but...
373963	375244	It wouldn't be so bad.
375744	380906	Stitch, as far as Stitch goes in the movie, was well represented, I think.
381067	382427	I mean, it looked good.
382947	387950	It's all the other side characters that they tweaked and changed and then added more in.
388030	389751	It's like, why?
389931	393593	Why did you add more side characters and nobody cares about these people?
393613	395494	And then certain things they took out because of...
396468	398269	The culture that we live in now.
398709	399909	Interesting.
400149	401250	Stupid things like that.
402550	409373	I'm curious if the non-Disney remake, because they're doing How to Train Your Dragon as a remake now.
410413	413415	That one's going to maybe buck the trend because it's not Disney.
413475	414375	I'm very curious.
414415	415275	That would be very interesting.
415916	417936	Maybe they'll remake all the non-Disney.
418537	420337	Can we get a Shrek live action remake?
420677	424459	I think there are millions of people that would love a Shrek live action remake.
424779	425841	No, I'm sorry.
425961	426281	Yes.
427342	430006	We're getting a Shrek 5, so I mean, that's coming.
430146	439197	Ever since I saw the performances online of, it's a drag Shrek, secondary characters only.
439438	439638	Yeah.
440258	440618	No, no, no.
440659	452326	They did show... So there was a teaser for the new Shrek, and if I remember correctly, I think they changed what his model or some of the models of the characters look like, and it's not great.
452926	453226	Uh-oh.
453246	454147	If I remember correctly.
454167	454947	Uh-oh.
455087	457469	It's like, what did you do to this?
457549	458449	And I get it.
458690	466514	Shrek and that stuff was from an age of when earlier CG, and obviously things have improved over time, but also...
467914	469514	Like, I don't know.
472055	476996	Maybe if it's been like over 10 years since your last movie, maybe you don't need to make another one.
477696	478096	Maybe not.
478496	478796	Maybe not.
478836	483057	All right, let's get into, you know, we do love movies, but we also love video games.
483357	486177	And we have a couple kickoff topics tonight because they're pretty short.
486577	488938	And one of them at least has to do with my gaming week.
489018	491218	I don't know about y'all, but I play the shit out of this this week.
491238	492638	So we'll get into that in a little bit.
492678	496119	But first, an interesting plot twist in Sony's world, right, Loki?
496139	496239	Yeah.
497307	501312	I mean, I didn't think this was going to last very long anyways, because it's barely mentioned.
502052	503254	Horrible job promoting this.
503634	513085	Yeah, their other incentive program that they had as well, which I also could never figure out how to get enrolled in or get points in, or when I did have points, how to do anything with it.
513445	514446	So, like, it doesn't even matter.
514526	519371	But anyways, PlayStation Stars, their loyalty program that you may or may not have been aware of,
520393	524457	Where you can get points for playing games, launching programs, doing that kind of stuff.
525198	526339	Yeah, they're sunsetting it.
526499	534128	So as of this week, they're going to no longer let you, or I should say last week, no longer letting you sign up.
534388	537431	Probably because it's being shut down July 23rd.
538772	553540	or I'm sorry July 23rd all campaigns additional rewards and existing benefits will cease yay and then November 2nd 2026 any remaining points you have will be wiped out because they'll be officially over um
555365	556445	Yeah, I don't know.
556605	562207	They said, since launching our program, we've learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond to.
562647	566748	And as a company, we're always involved in blah, blah, blah.
567369	572350	Through this evaluation, we've decided to refocus our efforts and we'll be winding down the current PlayStation Starz.
572690	578752	My guess is because people aren't using it and also maybe just the engagement that they got with it wasn't good.
578772	581453	But once again, they didn't push it and the rewards are probably crap.
581473	581513	So...
583962	585023	I don't know who cares
611215	620538	So, before they shut this down, I would encourage you, if you think you may have signed up for this, because obviously you can't sign up for it now, but if you think you may have signed up for this, go in and see if you have accumulated stars.
620878	627100	You might be able to get, like, a $5, $10 PlayStation gift card through this, which, hey, $10, free money, right?
627720	627960	Mm-hmm.
628240	629381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
652861	653841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
673531	702464	and um but but then it was like oh by getting trophies you can level up to three and four and then what do you get when you level up to level four do you get these awesome perks no they call it priority routing for voice chat the fuck does that even mean priority routing for what the fuck does that even mean do the pores do the pores get like Dixie cup and string quality chat like what's what's going on I don't under like it makes no sense as a perk why should like
703544	704204	Yeah, I know.
704264	705465	It doesn't make sense.
705665	706526	Once again, look at that.
706546	707526	Let's think about that for a second, okay?
707566	712089	A company is giving you a feature that the console already technically has.
729844	731725	So it's like really of no value.
731765	734588	It's like, oh yeah, we took this away so we can give it back to you.
734828	735990	Aren't you thankful?
736110	739974	You haven't said thank you yet for our PlayStation Star service.
740674	741415	We're taking it away.
741475	744078	You aren't grateful enough for it.
745279	746100	It's very there.
746180	746901	It's very there.
748220	748860	But you know what?
748880	750181	You know who is more grateful?
751002	752683	Microsoft, maybe, in this case.
752783	758167	Because they're going to give you 50-plus classic Activision games, as well as other things.
759468	761049	Sierra, hello?
761509	763311	Hello, Sierra?
764554	767436	through AntStream's arcade streaming.
767737	770459	So it's the new retro classics.
771199	772841	And like I said, it's powered by AntStream.
773121	777344	And they've got a bunch of old classic games.
777485	779386	You know, Sierra, Activision.
779426	781007	I see some of the MechWarrior stuff in there.
781268	786152	Some of the older, obviously, like 2600 Activision games as well.
787012	789254	Even looks like there's a PlayStation 1 game on there.
789835	791796	Amiga, Super Nintendo, DOS.
792997	807287	um lots of offerings 50 games so far and I think more are going to be coming later on um yeah that's really cool apparently if you have of course your uh game pass subscription so um
808089	809069	Yeah, that's really cool to check out.
809129	810550	I've not played any of this yet.
810570	815592	So Microsoft fucking stealth released Game Room again randomly in the middle of the week.
816892	817412	Kind of.
817452	818813	It's not actually Game Room.
818833	820153	There's some very big differences.
820293	823734	But I gotta say, I was... There's no room for the games again.
823994	824274	Shut up.
824675	827616	I was very pleasantly surprised at this release.
828356	830797	You know I love me some retro games.
831577	836078	And I was just shocked to see that this just came back out of nowhere.
836539	837179	And I was like...
837819	842823	This... No, but this is... This is what I fucking wanted Microsoft to do when they purchased Activision.
843163	849348	Like, I was like, do you know what a rich fucking library... Activision has been around since fucking Atari days.
849769	857956	Like, they have been making, like, really... They were the good guys in the Atari days, believe it or not, because they were willing to credit developers and publishers.
858336	860317	Remember David Crane's Pitfall?
860698	863240	One of the, like, legendary games of all time and all that?
863740	865201	Like, this is a...
866431	868412	This is what I wanted to see them do.
868772	875236	So to see this really come out of nowhere was really surprising in the best possible way.
876077	876257	So...
877383	880286	But is it really Nowhere?
880986	882328	Because it isn't.
882608	886552	It's built completely on the back of something else.
887292	888994	And that was also surprising.
889394	892237	And also probably the most controversial take of this whole thing.
892917	895980	So what this really is, this is AntStream.
896721	897622	You remember AntStream?
898282	903745	AntStream was that company that launched a Kickstarter about... I want to say it was probably even before the pandemic.
903785	904646	It was a few years ago.
905366	909188	And they were going to cloud stream classic games.
909649	912991	And that was a little bit controversial because not everybody's into the cloud streaming.
913451	922076	But being server-side, it allows them to do some things like challenges and tournaments and competitions without fear of people necessarily hacking this.
922496	925158	This literally the retro classics...
926459	928561	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
949378	957804	that only has the games that Microsoft has the rights to through all of their acquisitions over the years, which now includes Activision.
958184	964968	I didn't even realize that somehow included the magic stuff like Atlantis and those games from the Atari days.
965508	968631	Sierra, which Activision acquired at some point.
968931	971312	So, I mean, it's really leaning into some of their legacy holdings.
971672	974474	But the most controversial part of this app is going to be it's cloud streaming.
974815	976776	And people are going to say, eh, that sucks.
976796	978357	That's not how I want to enjoy my retro games.
979895	984458	Well, I mean, streaming retro games, they're so small.
984558	988080	I can't imagine it's actually streaming that stuff.
988120	989981	It's just downloading to your console.
990041	991081	It does nothing to your bandwidth.
991181	1002487	But I noticed when I was streaming, so there's a game in there that a Magic made called Cosmic Ark, which I just did a YouTube video on that when I was kind of doing my retro stuff last year before that fell off the wagon.
1002787	1007730	But I did a whole video on Cosmic Ark, and so I played that because they have a challenge where...
1007890	1014433	which, again, that's the part I love about this is that they have these challenges and they do things with it where they can actually have these retro competitions.
1014913	1019415	So I was doing a challenge for Cosmic Arc and I was like, oh, I can tell the artifacting in this one.
1019435	1020615	Oof.
1020675	1021295	You can see it.
1021656	1036622	Like, you know, because it's very colorful and I was like, I mean, it's not horrible, but it's enough where I'm like, okay, for an Atari 2600 game, I can see that some pixels don't look the same color as others and it's, yeah, it's that whole thing.
1037122	1037242	So...
1038022	1041184	I'm going to chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1042104	1056472	Let's see, PodCulture says, I wonder if you could use the Switch 2 controller, and I think that's in a response to QuestBuster saying, it's wild seeing Quest of Glory on a modern console, which I definitely applaud, but using a controller to navigate it had me jonesing for a keyboard and mouse.
1057052	1058973	Yeah, and you can play it on PC as well, but yeah.
1064429	1069632	I really do dislike cloud streaming games, TBH.
1070052	1071673	It's always on DRM 211.
1072434	1073875	And I get that, and that's valid.
1073995	1076957	And that's why I can't really say this is Game Room.
1077337	1079418	This is AntStream, but it's Microsoft's version of that.
1079898	1080239	Still...
1080999	1081820	Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass
1097699	1099279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1117284	1117905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1135640	1137140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1160066	1162187	The notification screen is completely broken.
1162668	1164549	And so you go to this challenge screen, there's nothing there.
1164669	1166730	You can't actually see how the challenge performed.
1167991	1178498	You can tell that the code name for this game while they were developing it was Pleasantville, which I think is a clever little name if you think of the movie that came out probably 20 years ago at this point.
1178839	1184522	But the movie Pleasantville, you can tell that the – because the name is still everywhere.
1184883	1189906	If you take a screenshot in the client, it spits out and it's called Pleasantville and whatever the screen is.
1190466	1193930	A permission screen will come up and it says Pleasantville, at least on PC.
1193990	1196172	I've been playing mostly this on PC, not on a console.
1197152	1205260	So there are some parts that feel a little like they're not fully... There's an achievement for tournaments, but I don't think the tournament system is in the game yet.
1205760	1209103	But AntStream has tournaments, so I know how that's going to turn out, but...
1209964	1212865	and somebody had asked in chat earlier if I had AntStream.
1213005	1213665	I used to.
1214226	1217967	I actually kickstarted it and I had it for like two or three years.
1218487	1222348	And the only reason I let it lapse is that they never, no, that's how I know.
1222388	1233692	So this was 2018 because they never updated the client to Xbox Series X. They did eventually like a year or two ago, but I just never got back on the bandwagon.
1233732	1234713	I never picked it back up.
1235433	1241955	So, yeah, I just never got back on AntStream.
1242295	1243295	But that's not a bad thing.
1243335	1245736	Like, I always thought it was kind of a neat little thing.
1246116	1250597	But yeah, I mean, the cloud streaming is controversial, you know, whatever.
1251037	1252338	But I think this is a nice little...
1252958	1254338	Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass
1276565	1289620	If they actually lean into this and they do really release games every week or so from Microsoft's rich library, of which there's a lot, and maybe are able to partner up with some other people, this could be pretty fucking cool.
1290381	1293244	If Sierra is a part of this...
1293905	1294305	Hello?
1294926	1299370	I can't wait for things like The Island of Dr. Brain and The Castle of Dr. Brain.
1299390	1300271	Like, where are those games?
1300351	1301112	I'm fucking excited.
1301392	1303114	You think Leisure Shoot Larry might ever be in there?
1303234	1303514	I don't know.
1303554	1304155	That might be a lot.
1304535	1305296	I don't know about that.
1305356	1306617	They have Willie Beamish already.
1306637	1307798	Yeah, Willie Beamish is in there.
1308118	1309680	There's one space quest.
1309700	1310681	There's one police quest.
1311161	1312402	But there's no King's Quest.
1313243	1314123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1331849	1332269	Maybe?
1332550	1334911	I don't know, but that's a whole separate thing that you can buy now.
1335632	1335952	I don't know.
1336132	1336413	I don't know.
1337133	1342597	DarkTutsu in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, I'm guessing Xbox felt left out on the retro stuff.
1342937	1343678	Maybe a little bit.
1344198	1344799	It's hard to say.
1345199	1345760	It's hard to say.
1346160	1350843	But they wanted to add value, and this is... I mean, I can't complain.
1351664	1378838	I was already paying for Game Pass because of these other games that I'm playing on it so this is just kind of a thing to sort of sweeten the pot SheHulk10 says they will probably come out with Xbox 360 Classics 100 games I don't know about that because a lot of those games they still sell on the marketplace if they're compatible with Xbox One and Series X but maybe especially as we start to go into the next generation of Xbox I don't think that should necessarily be off the table
1380305	1381085	We'll see what happens.
1381745	1382106	We'll see.
1382706	1385046	I mean, I guess, you know, because I keep saying, why not?
1385106	1386867	Microsoft wants to make money off of it.
1387167	1393609	But at the same time, if they can make that money from Game Pass, then I wouldn't say.
1394629	1395210	It'll be interesting.
1395250	1395530	We'll see.
1396550	1396790	All right.
1397070	1402292	Well, let's talk about what other types of games we were playing this week in a segment we call How Was Your Gaming Week?
1402692	1403952	DarkSakura, we'll go back to you.
1404012	1405693	I'm sure you want to talk about pinball and more.
1405713	1406333	How was your gaming week?
1407586	1410509	Yeah, it was pretty eventful.
1410629	1415994	I'm getting up my pictures so I can tell you what exactly I played because I took pictures of everything I played.
1417035	1420058	So I started off with ABBA, It's Not Good.
1420939	1422460	Oh, that's so depressing to hear.
1422480	1424222	It's my favorite band.
1424522	1425443	It's my favorite.
1426431	1429475	Alien, however, was right next to it and it was fucking amazing.
1429755	1430736	It was the Ripley edition.
1432017	1433059	It was really good.
1433619	1434180	Really good.
1435321	1437704	Um... I, um...
1439269	1444671	I played... I'm trying to get to the next pictures because I took a lot of pictures of the tables I super enjoyed.
1446212	1447712	I sent you a bunch, I know that.
1448093	1448653	You did.
1449653	1452574	I played Dungeons & Dragons The Tyrant's Eye.
1452874	1454195	It was super good.
1454515	1455155	Super fun.
1455395	1456336	I really enjoyed it.
1458757	1464919	I played... Oh, someone had the phone booth from Bill & Ted there.
1465019	1465519	It was great.
1466520	1466620	Um...
1468655	1471196	I played Ninja Eclipse.
1471836	1472816	That one was fun.
1473336	1474537	Total Annihilation.
1475297	1477097	I actually won Bellringer this year.
1480618	1481419	What's that?
1482499	1489621	It's like a kid's one where you just do one ball and you have to spin it around and get it in the center target to ring the bell.
1490641	1491401	I played X-Men.
1492042	1492982	It was also really good.
1493922	1496563	I played Heavy Metal Meltdown.
1496923	1497303	It was alright.
1498066	1499087	Played Baby Pac-Man.
1499127	1499667	We didn't buy it.
1501368	1501848	Firepower.
1501868	1503429	I was so tempted when you told me that.
1504709	1505510	Stranger Things.
1505850	1508411	That actually is a bit much for what it is.
1510192	1511673	Last Action Hero was broken.
1511993	1515875	That was a table that Dan and I used to play a lot at the old Godfather's Pizza in Atomos.
1516895	1519537	Because that's where I would drop off the deposit when I worked at GNC.
1521898	1523900	Um, Oktoberfest.
1524340	1528442	That one, I actually enjoy Oktoberfest a lot more than I did the first time I played it.
1528803	1531044	Of course I played Foo Fighters, which is always awesome.
1531524	1536328	I played Royal Rumble, which I hadn't played that one before, and it's a lot more fun than I thought it was gonna be.
1537508	1540290	Um, I bought Giant Flippers.
1541271	1544073	Um, uh, there was, uh...
1545461	1545961	Hot Wheels.
1546321	1547282	That one was pretty fun.
1547362	1548743	Swords of Fury is always fun.
1549683	1551204	Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
1551864	1553305	Whodunit, which I used to own.
1555747	1557668	Iron Maiden, but the old Iron Maiden table.
1558448	1559689	Not the current one.
1560829	1561790	It's like an old stern.
1563010	1566932	I played the 007 table that's themed around different movies.
1567233	1568193	Oh, I love that table.
1569114	1569974	Demolition Man.
1571375	1571475	Um...
1574266	1575706	Yeah, I just played a bunch of stuff.
1575746	1579147	And of course, we brought Portal.
1580188	1583469	It's a multi-morphic of the P3, the modular tables.
1585509	1591871	And of course, it's been in my garage for two weeks, and I got to play quite a bit of it.
1592591	1593152	It's pretty fun.
1594052	1600534	Of course, all the GLaDOS lines are taken from the game, but there's a new personality core named Reggie.
1600554	1601114	Hmm.
1601704	1604326	Who's sort of like your narrator through the game.
1605247	1607209	Loosely based on Wheatley, but not stupid.
1608690	1611092	He's like the... What's the word I'm thinking of?
1611853	1614695	Concierge wants to come to mind, but that's not the word I'm thinking of.
1615716	1619800	Like... I don't know, maybe...
1621385	1622266	I also attended a...
1645017	1650198	A little seminar about changing out units and some of the basics on the P3.
1650238	1653699	And I learned that the P3 units, most of them have Twitch integration.
1654339	1654679	Oh, really?
1654739	1662501	So you can stream the video play field on your live streams.
1663001	1665622	And that might become a thing down the line.
1665762	1666422	Wow, that's cool.
1667402	1670823	And some of the tables like Weird Al has sort of like a...
1674221	1674901	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1700394	1702575	I played, of course, played a bunch of Dead by Daylight.
1702655	1710538	I played a lot with Nick yesterday because he's doing a stream for a cause right now, raising money for charity.
1711479	1716441	Yeah, shout out to our pal Nick and Prince who's doing that charity right now.
1718202	1720263	He's going to, I think, have sleep time in a little bit.
1721784	1724525	Napping is a good idea and having your friends fill in for you.
1724545	1730548	Well, there's only so many ways you can go all weekend long, right?
1732509	1733849	Like, you have to have the help.
1734269	1735310	I think he's two days in.
1735510	1735750	Yeah.
1738131	1742753	But at any rate, I also played some Palia, and I played a lot of Mass Effect.
1742793	1747175	I did the Vermeier mission last night, and of course, Captain Cardboard got axed.
1750874	1764509	and not a lot of people save Ashley so that's also the other reason why I was saving her because I want to show more people that she learns she actually starts learning from her experiences and becomes a better person
1765578	1765638	Hmm.
1794355	1797261	Well, anyway, that was that's pretty much it.
1798122	1799385	Okay.
1799485	1800948	Let's go over to Loki.
1801008	1801749	How was your gaming week?
1803663	1805905	It's just playing Minecraft as usual.
1806846	1817956	I've been working a lot on trying to get my next episode out, but I have a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff that I have to do as part of this latest build, which is that Legally Distinct Cracker Barrel.
1820038	1824543	So I do this thing, or at least I have been doing this thing for the last few shops they've been putting together.
1824583	1826104	It's kind of a social experiment.
1826184	1826785	I'll hide...
1828174	1830196	Something for people to find.
1830836	1836421	And it just keeps getting more and more elaborate as I put out more and more shops.
1837061	1839744	And so now this is like the fifth time I've done this.
1840725	1843927	Yeah, it's gotten extremely elaborate at this point.
1844688	1846509	So there's a lot of like...
1847523	1850206	Custom artwork and stuff I'm working on behind the scenes.
1850406	1851727	That's all part of it.
1851807	1853749	Unfortunately, it's only the process.
1854289	1856972	But they'll have fun when they figure out what it is.
1858413	1864138	Other than that, I'm messing around a little bit with my Retroid Pocket Flip 2.
1864539	1872806	So I've been playing... I've been meaning to sit down and start Final Fantasy VI, but I just haven't had a chance to...
1874116	1874996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1893837	1896839	Yeah, I may just have to create an identical setup on my PC as well.
1898360	1899880	But yeah, I'm going to try to get into that.
1899900	1905263	I've been just playing arcade games, going through Metal Slug and the Contra arcade versions.
1905303	1906924	I don't think I've ever played Contra in the arcade.
1908005	1911147	And... What else?
1911667	1913468	What do they call that?
1913868	1917370	There's one I used to play on the candy cabs at Arcade Infinity all the time.
1918031	1918171	It's...
1921241	1922522	Oh, I can't remember the name now.
1923282	1927664	Not Gal's Panic, but it's along those lines.
1927724	1933107	It was like 3D and not safe for work, I guess.
1933167	1935668	I can see the game in my head, but I don't know what it was called either.
1935708	1940790	Yeah, it's like Go Go Something or Let's Go Something or Let's Do This.
1940890	1941371	I don't remember.
1941511	1943532	I can look it up, but I don't want to right now.
1945112	1946093	But yeah, it's...
1947065	1949545	It's been a lot of fun just messing around with some of these random arcade games.
1949625	1957967	I still need to fix my... And I never did get this with even when I set up MAME on my old arcade cabinet and stuff like that.
1959107	1966088	Using the compressed hard drives and stuff along with those hard drive images, I still haven't quite figured out how to do that properly.
1966468	1971789	So none of those games that I have that have those work right now.
1971889	1975150	And some of those are the ones I really want to play like Gauntlet Legends and...
1976590	2005810	there's like some shmup games San Francisco Rush, California Speed like the old like late 90s early 2000s racing games and stuff like that I think would be a lot of fun to play especially San Francisco Rush all that stuff just setting that up so I'll probably have to look at those images and see when you're talking about like ROM sets and MAME and stuff it gets really complicated like you could have a completely wrong set and it doesn't work so we'll have to go back to the drawing board with some of those alright
2007347	2010069	Well, then if that's it for your gaming week, I'll talk about my gaming week.
2010089	2012091	But honestly, it was pretty short and simple.
2012972	2021678	I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV, a little bit of Diablo 4, but I think I'm kind of done with Diablo 4 for this season because it's just kind of run its course for me.
2021819	2023320	I think it's supposed to be a short season anyway.
2023380	2026462	There's a couple cosmetics left I want to get, but I mean...
2027423	2027964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2045959	2047141	I got some other games I got to play too.
2047582	2054834	Little bit of Claire Obscure, still annoyed at the lack of a map because I did that thing where I went into a map and I was like running around.
2054874	2055976	I was like, oh, here's an exit.
2055996	2058800	And I found a door and then I ended up going out the way I came in.
2060740	2061140	DarkSakura.com
2091138	2107772	Talia is great it just came out and this is this is the catalyst it just came out on PlayStation 5 and I think it's on Series X as well but yeah but I picked it well that's why when we were playing the other night let me do some of the fun stuff yeah and that was why I was like I can't talk to you because I'm on the PS5 client
2107972	2110293	So it's well, I mean, I can I can type.
2110353	2112413	I have to type in my controller, which is no fun.
2112793	2115774	But yeah, so that's that's where I started.
2116174	2118035	And then that's why I got some of those gifts.
2118095	2120516	And I was like, oh, they sent me an arcade machine, too.
2120696	2123697	But I think it's because it's like a PlayStation founders pack or something.
2124217	2130059	So, yeah, I mean, so if you haven't played Palia, I mean, DarkSakura streams it pretty often.
2130079	2137601	And I know we've rated her after a show once, but I might be able to do some of the glitching, some of it.
2137961	2138682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2156693	2159454	and, you know, I was all like, oh, I've got my little log cabin.
2159514	2163496	I'm like, oh, it's like my little animal crossing little hut there.
2163936	2167518	And then DarkSakura signed on and I was like, oh, can I add you as a friend?
2167858	2169939	And DarkSakura said, yes, and come to my house.
2170380	2171380	I have four of them.
2171740	2173321	And I was like, oh, okay.
2173861	2177783	And then I go, oh my god, palace, palace, palace.
2177883	2182124	And I was like, Jesus Christ, how many trees have you chopped down to get this?
2182664	2183825	But no, I was impressed.
2183925	2185105	I was like, dang.
2185405	2189667	You know, because I've watched you stream Palia before, but obviously a lot of it like went over my head.
2190947	2195309	And now I'm like, now like kind of seeing it firsthand, I was like, dang.
2195329	2195529	Dang.
2196289	2197450	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2218991	2225034	No, you just get a wider range with your water.
2225114	2228555	But I mean, overall though, I mean, it's a very...
2233314	2234474	It's very relaxing.
2234834	2235114	It is.
2235415	2253539	It is a very... Well, Loki plays the shit out of Minecraft, and at its core, this game is not that much different from Minecraft, except you're not deconstructing and constructing in the same way, but it's still the same concepts of mine things and shoot cute little animals to cook them.
2253739	2256640	Yeah, it's a lot of the same fucking concepts.
2258021	2260722	But you have to get the material to build it.
2261002	2261202	Yeah.
2261622	2263563	Or No Man's Sky, in a way.
2263643	2265503	This is just No Man's Sky, not in space.
2266064	2267904	I mean, you know, this is a whole genre.
2267924	2273106	The crafting and gathering genre in games is bigger and bigger.
2273146	2276607	And a lot of you have probably played some type of game that fell in this genre somewhere.
2277027	2285930	But considering it's a free-to-play game, and I haven't felt the pressure to monetize yet, I don't know if that gets worse later on, but I haven't felt pressure to monetize
2286990	2287691	I'm enjoying it.
2287711	2288391	Literally not.
2289072	2293635	The only thing I did is I joined the Zeki Club.
2295056	2300480	Because you get points that you can use to redeem for stuff later on.
2301120	2303502	And that's, I think, fine.
2303602	2307985	It's not a very big investment, and it's pretty fun.
2309219	2311480	Go to our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
2311560	2316243	Fifth Dream says that cozy Fantasy Life game you mentioned here really recently apparently took off.
2316683	2317724	Yes, I heard about that too.
2317744	2322706	Apparently Fantasy Life, the one that just came out like last week, already sold half a million copies.
2323266	2323947	Pretty impressive.
2324547	2331011	And I do want to get that game, but I'm kind of like, oh, we're like, what, two weeks from the Nintendo Switch 2?
2332051	2332171	Yeah.
2332231	2332371	Yeah.
2332391	2332531	Yeah.
2332571	2332771	Yeah.
2332811	2332971	Yeah.
2356792	2371448	and then fall down the Switch 2 hole for a little while then maybe I'll come back when Fantasy Life goes on sale for like $40-$50 and I'll get up on that and I know that's not nice to the developers to just wait for games to go on sale but that's the reality of the $70 and $80 game
2373110	2374391	I'm just going to keep it real.
2374771	2377052	Like, yes, of course I want to support developers.
2377112	2379454	Of course I want to be a consumer.
2379614	2384317	And when I sit here and talk about layoffs suck and stuff, I want to still support developers wherever I can.
2384357	2389460	But the reality is I have to pick and choose what I drop 70 bucks on.
2389960	2394943	And when there's a free game over here that's like, come play me for a little bit.
2395563	2398806	Paglia, that's very similar in some ways to Fantasy Life.
2399226	2403309	It's easy for me to say, oh, I'm going to go play with that one for a little while.
2403870	2404851	And then I'll come back and do it.
2406652	2417121	Ranmari68k in chat says, to be fair to you, Rob, the problem is that for the $70 to $80 games, a lot of the money ends up going to the CEO's pockets instead.
2418041	2420744	I believe as the kids say today, period.
2421884	2422385	Period.
2422405	2422525	Period.
2423652	2425913	Anyway, that's it for my gaming week.
2425953	2427374	Let's get into some more gaming news.
2428575	2429655	Loki, we'll start with you.
2431776	2432237	All right.
2433517	2442822	Well, we knew this was coming right after we even talked about it last week with the whole AI, Fortnite, Darth Vader thing.
2443663	2445924	Didn't I say something similar?
2446664	2449126	It didn't quite turn out the way I said it, but still, a little bit.
2449266	2451327	Yeah, so it's not...
2451747	2460419	So SAG-AFTRA, you know, filed an unfair labor practice charge against Epic Games and Llama Productions.
2461961	2467929	This is not because they used the AI, it's because of how they went about the process of using the AI, I guess.
2469571	2482335	So it says, we celebrate the right of our members and their states to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles.
2483095	2498800	However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around the use of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.
2500761	2517049	that basically they said that Epic and Llama Productions chose to replace the work of human performers with AI and did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this without allowing unions to bargain over fair terms.
2520070	2522031	This is an interesting angle.
2522112	2529076	It's one of those things where I didn't think of it last week because I said that this was just giving the Darth Vader using all the slurs in Fortnite games.
2529376	2536741	That's just giving SAG-AFTRA the ammunition to revoke the James Earl Jones permission things and reevaluate that.
2537121	2541664	But I didn't think, oh, by them doing this in the first place –
2542304	2557874	Technically, they're violating union agreements because, and I just want to reiterate what you said, they're allowing AI to do a job that should have gone to a Darth Vader successor, basically.
2557914	2560836	You know how when voice actors pass away or decide to move on?
2561377	2562578	Charles Martinet, for example.
2562618	2563178	He didn't pass away.
2563218	2564659	Thank God we still have him among us.
2564699	2566920	But he retired, whether it was his choice or not.
2566980	2567981	He retired from that.
2568341	2572084	And now we have a successor, Mario, that was invited to do that.
2572564	2575106	That's what's supposed to happen in these union things.
2575366	2583253	Except, I will point out one thing, James Earl Jones himself gave the permission.
2583333	2588417	He did, but that doesn't change the union.
2588657	2595002	Because the union says you're letting AI do the job of somebody else that could do it.
2595262	2596684	That's a union agreement thing.
2598485	2612519	We were talking a little bit about this last week, but yeah, I'm aware James Earl Jones Estate has the permission and all that, but I wonder what they're going to think when they see those TikToks of him using slurs, which they were able to do within 10 minutes of that feature going live.
2612579	2614140	I wonder if they're still going to feel that way.
2614861	2620325	So, you know, and last week, I know you weren't here, Jim, but last week I had said that's going to show up in court.
2620625	2625849	SAG-AFTRA is going to take that footage, take it to a courtroom and say this should be revoked.
2626410	2632735	James Earl Jones, his estate, never would have agreed to this if they saw this is what was going to become of it and fight it that way.
2632795	2634015	I thought that's what was going to happen.
2634296	2637058	The managers of his estate, how they weighed in on it.
2637967	2638947	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2667552	2675734	Right, and I wouldn't necessarily say that this is going to be like, they're going to stop stuff from happening because of this instance.
2676094	2687577	However, to go back to what Rob said before, yes, absolutely, this is going to be used in any sort of negotiation down the road where they're like, yeah, well, you know, we'll tastefully use your voice and be like...
2688597	2696481	James Earl Jones, classic, classic actor, iconic voice, and you have him saying slurs and shit.
2696841	2700163	You know, clearly that type of, you know...
2701857	2730462	care and you know emphasis on trying to make it realistic and family friendly within Fortnite you are cutting so many corners you might as well have just a god damn circle there because this is certainly not what the estate of the Jones estate would be like yeah we're cool with that you know James used to throw the slurs around all the time like I'm sorry no nor is Disney going to be excited about this
2731257	2740959	Well, this is what I was going back to about the about the estate and their statements and then the permission granted is because I wanted.
2742320	2743620	I'm glad that this is out there.
2743640	2745621	I want it to be an example.
2746101	2746321	Yeah.
2747341	2750602	And I think I want this to be a very big example.
2751016	2758580	And I'm going to say that my opinion, because I'm going to say something very strong, so I'm going to very clearly say this is my opinion.
2759040	2763742	My opinion is that James Earl Jones' estate was presented this agreement under false pretenses.
2764262	2772566	That they were told about it's the movies and it's going to keep his legacy alive in the films and allow his performance to be experienced by new generations.
2772666	2775367	And this part was never explained.
2775667	2776628	That's my opinion.
2777148	2780032	that this part was never explained and now here we are.
2780112	2785178	So it's like, oh, we could do all this other dirty shit too now that we have the sign on the dotted line.
2785699	2790505	So that's my opinion is that they agreed to this under false pretenses and now we're seeing the side effect of that.
2794295	2821076	and what else was I going to say with the whole oh a reminder again SAG-AFTRA is still striking with video game companies who won't fucking agree to the terms and AI continues to be a sticking point and this should end that argument from the game companies the actors have every right to protect themselves from this so just a reminder
2822318	2823579	SAG-AFTRA is still striking.
2825321	2828124	Anyway, let's move on to more stories, shall we?
2829346	2830447	Let's talk about something.
2831008	2832469	This might be a little bit positive.
2832569	2843882	We like to see games go multi-platform and probably not a huge surprise to hear that Microsoft is looking at porting more of their games and it'll be to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is out pretty soon.
2844662	2854289	This is apparently a little leak that came out courtesy of The Verge and Tom Warren in talking with an article about Microsoft and some of the ports.
2854649	2862394	Apparently, Hellblade 2 Senua's Saga is currently on the list of games that are going to be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2.
2862674	2868618	It's coming out for the PlayStation 5, as we know, but apparently there's a number of games that are going to be worked on for the Switch 2.
2869299	2872381	We don't know exactly what games yet, but I'd like...
2872941	2875943	Hello, Sea of Thieves seems so obvious.
2875963	2877104	Haven't they already announced that one?
2877444	2880466	Sea of Thieves is already on the Switch, isn't it?
2880586	2881106	I think it is.
2881166	2882727	Okay, yeah, then it is.
2882747	2886570	There's some games that are just so obvious, but how cool would it be?
2887491	2890092	Now, okay, so hear me out, folks.
2890933	2901500	There's been a lot of people that are like, Nintendo Switch needs to have a Game Pass app that would let you play Game Pass games on your Nintendo Switch.
2902751	2904692	What if... I don't think y'all are right.
2904812	2906132	I don't think it happens that way.
2906692	2910194	But what about the Retro Classics app now?
2910894	2911954	What about AntStream?
2912415	2918437	And what about maybe that being the reason why this needed to come out now, two weeks before the Switch 2 comes out?
2918837	2928481	Because maybe... Maybe Microsoft is going to put specifically the Retro Classics app on the Switch 2...
2930034	2933435	Granted, you'll be tied to cloud-based services, so don't get too excited.
2933455	2935516	You're not going to be able to take those games truly portable.
2935556	2943098	It'll require an internet connection, but you could still log in and play those, you know, sitting on your couch or in your bed or whatever around your house on a portable device.
2943858	2946579	I could see that happening.
2946659	2953341	I mean, at that point, they might as well just do like an Activision Classic Collection or something like that and just sell it.
2953801	2954762	Like, I don't know.
2955462	2957022	Sure, it's a possibility.
2957843	2958403	I mean, just...
2959702	2960403	I don't know.
2960923	2963946	Anything's possible if you think about it, but yeah.
2964827	2967670	I'd be curious to see what develops with that.
2967710	2968631	DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
2970473	2972254	Oh, just stuff.
2973414	2979616	So, Nintendo, as we know, had been absent from the last Gamescom.
2980357	2985959	They made an announcement that they will be there in Germany.
2986979	2992201	They did a post on their German language social media account that said that they will be on the show floor.
2993281	3005631	um there's a chance there might be a switch to direct who knows but there's also stuff about Metroid Prime 4 Beyond there could be Pokemon Legends so we don't know yeah
3007216	3010517	I mean, it makes sense that they're going to do Gamescom because they have more to show now.
3010597	3020701	Like last year, you know, the Switch was kind of ramping down and now with the Switch 2 ramping up, it makes sense they want to get that in people's hands on the show floor and, you know, get more hype going for it.
3020801	3023181	So I can't say I'm surprised to hear this.
3023221	3026683	It's nice to see them back, but I would like to see them do a Nintendo Direct.
3026703	3030344	I think we all would to really hear what the plan is through the holiday and all that.
3030424	3036166	But whether that's Gamecom or, you know, Keeley vs. Summer Game Fest, but those...
3036806	3038626	Well, no, because Gamescom's going to be a little later, right?
3038666	3039807	Gamescom says we're August.
3040747	3042007	But it could happen to either one.
3042567	3047028	I think Nintendo does make at least one big announcement at Summer Game Fest.
3048848	3053369	I don't know if it's as big as their holiday game, but I think they're going to announce something, something.
3053509	3055470	I think that's an easy prediction to make.
3055530	3061811	Nintendo announces something for Switch 2 at Keeley Fest because they've done it before.
3062431	3062571	So...
3063632	3065552	Yeah, August is Gamescom, so we'll see.
3066072	3088297	August, I mean, with the recent timetable of Nintendo kind of announcing things just a couple months before they come out, August does seem to be a more likely timeframe for them to announce something for the holiday, but August would also be a great time for them to maybe start pushing something a little harder like Metroid Prime 4, now that Mario Kart World will be two months old at that point, and the Donkey Kong game will be out as well.
3088977	3093298	Gamescom allows them to set the stage for the other upcoming games, so we'll see.
3095075	3096636	All right, moving on.
3096776	3100079	Wow, SJ100 Matt says Summer Game Fest is June 6th.
3100259	3102500	That's the same day as the Switch 2 release.
3102520	3103901	I did not realize it was the same day.
3104001	3107344	It's the day after Switch 2 releases the 5th.
3107564	3109025	Oh, I thought it was the 6th for some reason.
3109105	3110546	Okay, but still interesting.
3110726	3113188	They're being weird doing it on Thursday.
3113248	3114389	They're right on top of each other.
3114469	3115349	That's still interesting.
3115630	3116730	So, all right.
3117731	3118672	Well, let's move on.
3118752	3121414	This is definitely a story that's raising eyebrows, right, Loki?
3121434	3121534	Yeah.
3122438	3132945	Well, I mean, it's funny because, like, you know, there was a very famous instance of AI artwork in Call of Duty Zombies.
3133585	3136867	And, you know, they insisted, no, no, no, no, it's real art.
3136887	3138368	And then it came out that it was AI art.
3139209	3146033	But now, Dark Outlaw Games, which is a PlayStation studio run by Jason Blundall, who was...
3146934	3161122	basically known for developing the Call of Duty Black Ops zombie mode is now they're listing for a senior concept artist to join their LA studio and says they're reporting to their art director.
3161583	3173410	The ideal candidate is proactive with strong skills in digital illustration, 3D modeling, character design, graphic design, experience with generative AI tools, and passion about making games.
3175051	3188401	They also require advanced expertise in using generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, and similar platforms, as well as refining and polishing 2D artwork created by both human artists and generative AI tools.
3188421	3196668	So yes, they are using generative AI tools in the sense to, it sounds like, replace concept artists or at least, you know, get a start on concept art stuff.
3198334	3201875	It's gross, but it's going to happen.
3203276	3204877	Apologies for the error in the sidebar.
3204897	3207758	It should say Call of Duty former dev speaking AI specialist.
3207818	3215221	But anyway, still knowing that this is coming to – it's not like this is the last time we're going to see something like this, right?
3215521	3222783	Yeah, it's still a studio that's run by Sony.
3222843	3228504	So yeah, it's not Call of Duty dev in the sense that they're working on Call of Duty right now.
3228564	3233365	But yeah, I mean, you're going to see a lot of this in, I think, studios using AI.
3233845	3238746	I think it's depending on how much, how apparent that is in the final product.
3238806	3242287	Because if it's being used to replace, like,
3243658	3244579	AI is not a replacement.
3244599	3245019	It is a tool.
3269640	3271721	That's what this should be.
3271821	3273742	AI should not be replacing art.
3273982	3276683	AI can sometimes be a tool with art.
3278043	3278663	It's weird though.
3278683	3282105	They call all this shit AI now that isn't necessarily AI.
3282125	3283445	Large language models.
3283565	3290488	But I will admit I was working on a graphic the other day and I was using Adobe – what's their –
3291008	3291989	AIR is very cringe.
3313664	3320174	I mean, it's getting better, always, but, like, have you seen, like, the Google's VO3 stuff?
3321035	3327164	Where it's generating, like, video, and they have, like, now the actors can dialogue, or have dialogue with each other.
3327184	3328346	That stuff is wild.
3329567	3337635	They traded on YouTube videos and TV, and so they're like, oh, look, we can replace YouTubers with AI-generated crap.
3338035	3343320	And it's not good, but it's very convincing, certainly if you're not paying attention.
3343740	3348865	And certainly there's a large swath of the population that aren't paying attention.
3348905	3349826	Say it, say it.
3349986	3350286	Say it.
3350386	3357432	There is a large swath of population too stupid to critically think and will buy this shit at face value.
3357793	3363998	There are a lot of people out there uneducated on how to spot AI and this will absolutely be weaponized.
3364278	3364918	Absolutely.
3365219	3366400	They already are trying to do it.
3367936	3385652	and I've been doing it this this shit needs to come to a legal head like that like how the fact that it's training off of all of YouTube or whatever did they get permission from YouTubers to do it no I'm sure they snuck it into the agreement or whatever for you to be using YouTube you have to allow it but right now you have to opt out
3386954	3387735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3404267	3407749	That is the equivalent, I feel, of that posting on Facebook.
3408069	3411611	I don't give you permission to steal my data.
3412172	3413913	It's absolutely useless.
3414053	3415634	You bring up an excellent point.
3415974	3418776	People are stupid enough to think that does anything.
3419196	3423979	There's a lot of people, probably in your family, that think that that's going to do something.
3424400	3427662	Aren't you a little worried what they're going to believe in these videos?
3428102	3431925	It's just that generation, too, I think, because...
3432945	3434025	Think back.
3434146	3439888	Even way before the AI stuff and way before social media, what was it that we would get?
3440348	3449591	You would get Grandpa forwarding you those email forwards saying, you got to type this in here and then Bill Gates will send you a million dollars or something like that.
3449931	3451852	Forward it to five of your friends.
3452532	3458134	That bullshit was around back in the late 90s and shit when the internet was first...
3459014	3484244	becoming publicly available to everything so it's only gonna get worse from here in the sense of like using it to manipulate the masses into believing stuff or the case of showing a real video and going no that's AI I didn't I didn't do that that's AI someone generated that with AI and you'd be like well I can't tell because AI does look realistic so I don't know
3484984	3486025	Possible deniability.
3486525	3494872	All I have to say is that this AI stuff, it's just... Okay, let me tell this one quick story, then we'll move on to the next thing.
3495513	3502378	So my understanding is there's an app out there called Grindr, and either you know what that is or you don't, okay?
3502779	3511646	But there is an app out there called Grindr, and now that app, as I understand, when you log into that app, it will actually ask you for permissions to use AI.
3512907	3513548	For what?
3514129	3518313	For what does that app, that app, need AI for?
3519034	3532370	And I guess it wants to train off, to make fake people to play into, I mean, let me tell you, my understanding is there's plenty of fake people already on Grindr.
3533866	3535007	and all the other dating apps.
3535568	3545298	So what, I mean, when Grindr is asking permission to use AI, I think we all need to sit here and ask ourselves, what have we done?
3547740	3548801	Let's move on to our next story.
3550543	3550863	Please.
3551304	3552205	Let's talk about Konami.
3553622	3554062	and DarkSakura.
3568547	3569428	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3589267	3594050	Previously, this was Konami Amusements, but that was also Pachinko.
3594430	3597972	So the Pachinko and the arcade halves have divided.
3598933	3600954	So yeah, that's all going to be changing.
3601234	3606697	So Konami Arcade Games will be established June 2nd and become effective as of October 1st.
3607238	3614922	Konami Arcade Games will assume all assets, contracts, excuse me, liabilities and other obligations related to the arcade game business of Konami Amusements.
3616132	3622416	Yoshitaka Nishimura, who is composer in several Bamani rhythm games.
3622516	3624498	Is that the Taka Yoshitaka?
3627360	3634524	Anyway, well, he's the composer of several Konami beat mini rhythm games as its representative director and president.
3634705	3635505	So that'll be interesting.
3636386	3636526	So.
3638911	3642113	I guess if you're a Konami music game fan, which we still are at heart.
3642874	3647957	Oh, it's DJ Yoshitaka says Ranmari68 is the actual musician there.
3648077	3649118	So that's really cool.
3650799	3651059	All right.
3652360	3654301	So we'll say that that's a very...
3655945	3656305	DarkSakura
3685914	3705582	Sega has, of course, been introducing the Shinobi Art of Vengeance, and they say that if it does well, and this is from an interview with Sega's content production department, sorry, with the head, I think, Shimomura Kagase, who
3708422	3712725	to talk about... I just completely lost my train of thought.
3713186	3722473	They're saying that if this does well, that they are planning on reviving the Shinobi license.
3723033	3725495	They say that if... Sorry, the franchise.
3725855	3733461	They say that they could experience a sustained revival that sees it retake a place of prominence among Sega's IPs.
3733621	3734702	That's a quote.
3735603	3735903	So...
3738463	3747885	Another thing it says is that we do think that IPs are supposed to evolve and expand and we really do feel strongly about our Shinobi IP and want to take care of it and nurture it.
3748426	3751066	Maybe there might be a vengeance too somewhere along the road.
3751366	3757648	This is obviously nothing that's planned right now but it really depends on how we can nurture the IP in the future now the IP is going to grow.
3757948	3759348	But we definitely do want to grow it.
3760608	3761069	Interesting.
3761229	3761929	It looks good.
3762229	3764369	I was thinking of grabbing the limited run.
3764389	3767010	Alright.
3769152	3770474	Yeah, I might want to check that out too.
3770674	3774957	You know, my backlog just grows and grows, but I do have a soft spot in my heart for Shinobi.
3776359	3778440	Let's move on to another game I'm excited about, Loki.
3780042	3785126	Yep, Mario Kart World, just right around the corner.
3785526	3787908	And of course, it's fun hearing about these...
3788880	3789820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3810643	3811824	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3834659	3837221	I wondered why there was never a Mario Kart game on Switch.
3837662	3840164	Because Mario Kart 8 was a Wii U game that was ported.
3840804	3843226	So I wondered why there never was one, but this kind of answers it.
3843327	3844107	There was supposed to be.
3846069	3848331	And that's why this one is coming out so soon, right?
3848371	3851674	It's a launch game for Switch 2, which kind of all adds up now.
3852659	3859768	Yeah, so when we were developing for the Switch system, it became difficult to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return.
3860188	3866056	We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases.
3866516	3867878	It was a tough situation.
3869019	3870161	Yeah, I can give that.
3870691	3870971	Free, yeah.
3892492	3893934	God, because it needs it.
3894074	3894815	So I'm really excited.
3894855	3899320	I wish Pokemon Legends was getting that too, but at least there's a new Pokemon Legends game to look forward to later in the year.
3899420	3908430	So I'm just excited to revisit old Switch shit that's being up-dued for the Switch too, because yeah, it's going to be great.
3909051	3919020	All right, let's move on and talk about another part of the Switch 2, which, you know, one of the things that excites me a little bit is the mouse support.
3919320	3920101	And I talked about that.
3920501	3933012	I kind of think this is kind of one of those secret killer features of Switch 2 is that it's going to allow this control control scheme that brings us the best of keyboard and controller and the excuse me, keyboard and mouse support.
3933252	3935893	and the best of controller into a mouse and controller.
3936274	3941016	I guess there's no keyboard and controller setup, but a mouse and controller type of setup, which I think is pretty cool.
3941676	3947459	Some Switch 2 games, it's being reported, will allow you to plug in a USB mouse.
3948039	3954882	So you don't even have to use the Joy-Con turned on its side if you're worried that that's not going to be responsive or good enough.
3955383	3959685	Apparently, some Switch 2 games, you can just plug a USB mouse in.
3960945	3966608	So apparently this was something that was being spotted around social media.
3967008	3983256	Koei Tecmo put up an official gameplay stream of Nobunaga's Ambition Awakening CE running on the Switch 2 and the producer Michiru into the demo actually took out a USB mouse and started playing the game with the USB mouse.
3984238	3986619	So this, that's great.
3986779	3988479	I hope it works with the Bluetooth mouse too.
3988859	3989840	Wouldn't that be something?
3991580	3994761	But this is going to be like a game changer for something like Civ 7.
3995441	3997162	Like that, this is how I want to play Civ 7.
3998082	4000263	This is how I want to play Metroid Prime.
4001263	4000263	100%.
4001303	4003264	I really hope Nintendo is embracing this for Metroid Prime 4.
4003764	4012371	I have no doubt the Joy-Con thing will be it, but man, if they let you use a USB or even a Bluetooth mouse, like, I think it's a real significant game changer.
4012411	4015133	Yeah, QuestBusterChat says mouse users rise up.
4015534	4022039	Even something like Palia will be great because you can.
4023620	4024681	It does have mouse support, I think.
4024921	4025602	Even on consoles?
4025622	4025702	Yes.
4026815	4027995	I think so, I don't know
4051042	4055426	If it would work with a USB trackball, for those that prefer a trackball.
4055946	4057628	I don't see why not.
4057868	4060870	Don't a lot of systems sort of treat them as Mises?
4061971	4062352	I think?
4062992	4063593	Be interesting.
4065357	4071940	S. Jonah and Matt says, though, to be clear, the Switch one did have some mouse and keyboard support, but not a ton of things supported.
4072260	4082964	Yeah, I mean, and to be fair, on the PlayStation 4, you can play, like, Final Fantasy XIV will take a keyboard and mouse, and you can play that control and all that, but it's not very well advertised.
4083024	4084144	It's not in a lot of games.
4084705	4087346	And, you know, they have to go out of their way to support it.
4088826	4092908	And Xboxes support it in very few games, all things considered.
4094298	4096379	All right, well, let's go back to a simpler time.
4096419	4101220	And I was going to say a time before mouses and all that took over the world.
4101240	4107142	But that wouldn't be true for this pick because a classic game is 10 years older or more.
4107682	4111703	And well, we're going to run the bumper and then DarkSakura is going to tell you what she picked for this week.
4122287	4129591	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4130051	4133033	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4134254	4135194	All right, y'all.
4136115	4137556	Are you ready to feel old?
4137576	4139857	Are you ready to feel old?
4139877	4141298	Because this week's pick is going to do it.
4142098	4147181	DarkSakura, what is our 10 years old or more classic game of the week this week?
4148402	4148822	Splatoon.
4150427	4179499	yes, Splatoon is pretty much dead on 10 years old the game came out in 2015 on the Wii U it is a third person shooter game where you play as beings called Inklings that are cephalopodic lifeforms that can go between cephalopod forms and humanoid forms and they get into big turf wars with colors so yeah
4180233	4181774	There you go.
4181934	4198367	It was developed by Nintendo Entertainment's Analysis and Development Division, and it started with an idea of a competitive multiplayer ink-based territory control game, and then they expanded into squids and swimming through the ink.
4199087	4205993	The concept was created by their lead programmer, Sato Shintaro, who had worked previously on Animal Crossing.
4207093	4214500	and the team was mostly younger Nintendo employees compared to most of their other staff.
4216241	4218723	And so the game spawned a whole series.
4219204	4219244	So
4225624	4236970	Going back into this, so your team has a color and you have to pretty much cover the other color and then shoot the other people?
4238961	4254508	your own ink makes it faster for you to go through but enemy ink is slower to walk through in humanoid form and you cannot swim through it as a squid and it can actually hurt you so you try to use your ink to splat your opponents which will send them back to their starting point
4255633	4270391	um and so in all of the modes except for the two-player mode you can use your Wii U gamepad to view a map of your surroundings and launch towards the locations of another teammate and you can use gyroscopic controls to assist in aiming
4271732	4296144	and um so you go into your match with your primary ink weapon and uh you can get a secondary weapon like ink balloons and sprinklers and disruptive fields and you basically just keep going in and covering it up um the game does uh support the Splatoon amiibo which each of them will unlock different missions and extra equipment and clothes in a bonus mini game and uh
4297625	4321655	more ways to make money and you had the ability to make posts to the game's Miiverse community and you would see those as graffiti on buildings in the game there was multiplayer which was a regular and ranked game four different rule sets you had Turf War, Splat Zones, Tower Control and Rainmaker which was Capture the Flag style
4323195	4330700	On April 8th, 2024, online multiplayer was discontinued because of the shutdown of all online services for Wii U games.
4332321	4337244	Battle Dojo local multiplayer mode, you can do like balloon popping.
4339005	4345328	You can use a Wii U Pro Controller or Wii Classic Controller or the Wii U GamePad.
4345348	4346029	Even...
4349116	4352357	A controller in Wii Remote could do it as well.
4353618	4367244	Then there were the Splatfests, which was like a big multiplayer game where you could choose between one of two teams and earn points and goodies and things like that.
4367764	4370165	And then there was the campaign mode.
4370285	4372666	Octo Valley is the single player campaign mode.
4373206	4381609	and you are recruited by a veteran and the leader of Squidbeak's platoon, Captain Cuttlefish, to rescue the great Zapfish.
4382529	4396913	Now, as for development, in mid-2013, one of the members of the Animal Crossing developed teams, which is Sato Shintaro, created a 4v4 ink-based territory control game in this big featureless arena and management liked the prototypes.
4396954	4401635	They approved it being made into a full game and the team just kept going into it.
4402595	4423147	and it even you know it had so many ideas that developers were having some trouble filtering it down to be simple and fun that's from Miyamoto saying that there was no appeal to the game in that state and so they they kept narrowing it down and working on things and finally just got something simple that would work.
4425120	4436265	so as far as when it was released there was a time-limited multiplayer demo known as Global Testfire held on May 8th and 9th 2015 and one two-hour block on May 23rd 2015
4440066	4442108	on May 15th on the Santa Monica Pier.
4442568	4448192	Nintendo held a special event called the Splatoon Mess Fest with celebrities in an obstacle course inspired by the game.
4448693	4450094	You could play a demo at the event.
4451415	4458240	And there was a collaboration with Anbei Masahiro's Squid Girl Manga and including in-game costumes.
4458320	4458981	There were different
4459281	4480761	Outfits available in the Nintendo 3DS title Girls Mode 3, Kira Kira, Starcode And there was Splatoon Frozen Yogurt in Canada at Yogurty All kinds of stuff Nintendo UK worked with a journal in Alley Skate Park to decorate in decals And there was fan art, Miiverse and Twitter All kinds of stuff
4481321	4486762	and so the Wii U Deluxe set was bundled with Flat Tune in North America at Best Buy.
4487222	4493183	You got a coupon for a digital copy in Australia, Europe and New Zealand on a physical disc.
4493263	4504965	You had the Amiibo released alongside the game which was Boy and Girl Inkling and then there were two in-game pop idols, Callie and Marie known as the Squid Sisters.
4505045	4505825	They had Amiibo.
4507625	4508846	You could use the
4511630	4517956	If you pre-ordered the game at GameStop, you got a download voucher for a Splatoon-themed Mii costume to use in Super Smash Bros.
4519078	4520939	So, I mean, just all kinds of stuff.
4521039	4522020	I mean, lots of stuff.
4522040	4523782	They really, really, really promoted it.
4526265	4529208	And so to skip past a lot of that, going into the...
4531169	4556677	well actually there was that thing about online play in 2023 that there was a vulnerability with that Mario Kart 8 and then they fixed it and resumed everything and then they ended the services for Wii U so moving forward it was very well received people were surprised that Nintendo was doing a shooter IP but they thought it was unique and fun
4557889	4561613	It got an 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 88 reviews.
4562073	4564215	GamesRadar gave it a 3.5 out of 5.
4565816	4575724	Destructoid gave it an 8.5 and they said that there were some shortcomings but they could be overlooked because of quote, how damn fun the game is, end quote.
4576946	4578668	I think that's the important part.
4578688	4582953	A lot of people really enjoyed that sort of 90s cartoon aesthetic.
4584074	4588039	It even gave it some comparisons to Jess at Radio and Da Blob.
4590484	4615843	and it was great that it was ink based and not all bloody and gross Splatoon debuted at number 2 in the UK software sales chart only behind Witcher 3 Wild Hunt it was Nintendo's sorry it was the 5th fastest selling Wii U title and fastest selling new IP on the console and it beat the previous record set by Ubisoft's Zombie U
4617293	4619855	It debuted at the top of Japanese software sales.
4621556	4627700	In the US, there were 165,000 combined physical and downloaded copies sold in May 2015.
4628280	4633703	It really has just been one of the big ones.
4633943	4642649	And it was then announced in May 2016 that Splatoon was the most successful new home console IP in Japan since Wii Sports.
4644088	4652992	and the soundtrack actually even debuted at number two on Billboard Japan's Hot Albums chart and number 46 on the chart's 2015 year-end list.
4653632	4666118	It's won games, the British Academy Children's Awards, Best Nintendo Game for the 33rd Golden Joystick Award, Best Multiplayer, Best Shooter for the Game Awards,
4668220	4675028	most promising new intellectual property for the South by Southwest Gaming Awards and Japan Game Awards winning game of the year
4676175	4697455	There has been the Art of Splatoon book release, Toy Water Guns based off of the Ink Guns, Virtual Concerts with the Squid Sisters They were there as holograms on the Tokaigi 2016 Makuhari Mess in January and then at Japan Expo
4698522	4700944	and Nico Nico Cho Party in November.
4702265	4718375	There's manga written and illustrated by Hinodeya Sankichi that's been serialized in Besetsu Kodokoro Comic and actually it's even been re-released in English by Viz Media.
4720537	4725300	Kodokoro Comic gave free access to the entire series from 11th of Tain from June 22nd to July 13th, 2018.
4729323	4730924	and there you go, Splatoon.
4731944	4736367	All right, there's your, I can't believe this is 10 years old, pick of the week.
4737388	4752378	Looking at some comments in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, I saw some comments earlier on that were kind of talking about how a future Splatoon, yeah, Dr. Zia says, if they fix those issues for a Splatoon 4 and implemented the mouse controls, I might be convinced to dive back in.
4752478	4755420	Ooh, this is a very appropriately timed pick for
4755720	4761903	After that story about Nintendo Mouse, because yeah, getting mouse control in this game, holy shit, that would be a game changer for me.
4761983	4763104	I would love to play it.
4763784	4766445	NSJ100, Matt had mentioned the Splatfests were fun.
4766766	4771408	While it was just a silly social media thing, it was pretty smart and got folks coming back to it for the polls.
4771688	4776571	Yeah, back when Twitter was fun, you know, 10 years ago, and there was those Splatfests, but I will say-
4777611	4781774	Yeah, Ranmari68k says, if Mayo wins, I'll throw my switch in a lake.
4781934	4782354	Oh, God.
4783235	4786697	That catch-up Mayo fight, that made me physically ill.
4787298	4788199	Catch-up is gross.
4788919	4790880	But y'all know how I feel about mayonnaise.
4790900	4794263	It made me physically ill to see those matches, so I couldn't do it.
4795864	4798546	But I did appreciate how fun those things were.
4798646	4805571	Final Fantasy Online or something like that, I sort of remember some sort of team-based thing or something.
4806923	4807984	Final Fantasy Online?
4808364	4809665	Yeah, was that a thing?
4810545	4819090	They did the... There was their version of Monster Hunter that was... I can't remember the name of that game, but it was a DS game.
4819130	4823312	Final Fantasy Explorers, maybe, was what it was called.
4824753	4831216	Yeah, I just thought that they did something where you had to achieve a certain thing and they had different teams based off of your...
4834575	4839582	Maybe I'm thinking of the factions and how you had the different factions and you competed.
4840544	4841906	You got perks if you did that.
4842406	4842787	I don't know.
4844149	4845391	Alright, well let's move on.
4845411	4848375	We got some other news to cover here, so let's get into some rapid fire news.
4848435	4848636	Loki.
4850434	4852275	Great, another movie announcement.
4852395	4861120	So, The Elden Ring is being adapted for a movie, and this is going to be coming through A24.
4861780	4869164	And they announced that they're working with Alex Garland, who did Civil War and Ex Machina.
4870285	4876128	And yeah, good lord, I have no idea when or what this will even be.
4878271	4880373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4897446	4900827	You know, name in it too that I think the movie will be well received.
4900867	4905009	And yet again, you know, video game conversions are all the rage right now.
4905149	4908170	I believe Last of Us finale for season two is tonight.
4909610	4912612	So, you know, there's a lot going on with video game properties.
4912672	4916093	So I can't say I'm shocked to hear Elden Ring is becoming a movie.
4916909	4923739	I was gonna mention really quick, this is kind of a little bit of a last minute story type thing, but confusing, to say the least.
4923999	4931049	So, Michael Bay has, of course, is allegedly, of course, tied to the Skibbity Toilet movie.
4931089	4932171	Yes, I heard this too.
4932331	4932431	So...
4933112	4933852	No, hold on, hold on.
4934113	4936194	This doesn't make any sense when you think about it, okay?
4936314	4945059	So, he released a reel today saying, Hey, you guys, you've been saying that, you know, I'm involved or directing the Skibbity Toilet movie.
4945519	4946640	I'm doing no such thing.
4947140	4951563	Mind you, his previous two reels were teasers for the Skibbity Toilet movie, so...
4954326	4955126	I don't know!
4955867	4959348	You are saying one thing, but then also saying another thing.
4959928	4961108	I don't believe you, sir.
4961468	4965510	I believe that you are working on it, but you're not directing it.
4966410	4968891	No, he is not directing it.
4968971	4982295	He's probably playing another role with it, but you don't put a teaser out for the movie, or a piece of artwork for the movie, and then the next day go, what are you guys talking about?
4982315	4982695	I'm not...
4984881	4985382	It's not.
4985562	4986323	It's going to be amazing.
4986363	4987404	I want it to tank.
4987665	4989046	It's going to be so bad.
4989107	4989727	I can't wait.
4990248	4991129	I can't wait.
4991189	4993232	I want it to fail so hard.
4994413	4996276	Alright, let's go on to our next story, DarkSakura.
4998985	5001748	I'm also going to counteract what PodCulture said real quick.
5001828	5003170	Misery shared is halved.
5003330	5004051	No, it's doubled.
5006874	5015783	Anyway, I keep hitting my sound thing on my stream deck by accident, so I keep hearing the Cisco hold music at different intervals, and it's very distracting.
5015803	5016504	Yeah.
5017675	5019696	Anyway, Game Boy stuff.
5020076	5022898	How about for Nintendo Switch Game Boy stuff?
5022958	5030541	They are adding Gradius, Interstellar Assault, Kirby Star Stacker, Survival Kids, and The Sword of Hope.
5031141	5032002	How's that?
5033403	5033503	Um...
5034824	5042813	You are... I mean, the Gradius game is... It's an interesting Gradius game.
5044715	5050762	You have a dual-scrolling battlefield and 3D effects and blah blah, all the stuff.
5051723	5053104	Kirby Star Stacker is a puzzle game.
5054025	5055507	You do have a versus mode.
5056549	5065040	Survival Kids is, I mean, you have to create tools and hunt and, you know, very Lord of the Flies.
5065561	5067784	And then sort of Hope, where it's an RPG.
5068885	5069286	There you go.
5070273	5070473	Speed up!
5099646	5120126	uh anyway but I would I would say that Sword of Hope nothing like Secret of Mana even though they tried to jack the box art like looking things so but um sure it's it's an interesting don't be fooled it's an interesting relic of its era we'll leave it at that it's more of a wizardry inspired inspired game from the looks of it so
5121707	5122908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5138824	5142767	But if you aren't a player of that game, you can celebrate classic Nintendo in another way.
5143468	5150453	There are Switch user profile icons available until the 27th of May, so you know how much time left.
5151154	5158260	That's the first wave of icons where you can make yourself a classic NES controller or a Famicom controller or an Nintendo 64 controller.
5158600	5161803	And then through the coming weeks, you can do other interesting controllers.
5162283	5164965	But a lot of folks have noticed that Wave 3...
5166526	5178035	that starts June 3rd through June 10th offers a Famicom, a Super Famicom, a GameCube, and a Nintendo Super Nintendo mouse is in there too.
5178475	5181077	And it's like, since when is the Switch to acknowledge the mouse?
5181577	5187782	And it leads a lot of people to infer some things, but still, the user icons are cute if that's something you want to get in on.
5188062	5188983	So check that out.
5189683	5193206	Meanwhile, let's check out what's coming out this week in world release dates.

5471029	5475150	And in just two weeks, less than two weeks, we got a brand new console coming out.
5475210	5476390	So it must be summer.
5476751	5477251	Good times.
5477891	5478111	All right.
5478131	5478811	Well, we have one more.
5478871	5481332	Speaking of that new console, we have one more story for you here.
5481392	5484133	And then we're going to get to the listener roundtable where we have one email tonight.
5484493	5486534	So we'll go to Loki first.
5487813	5494339	Yes, Randy Pitchford, once again, opening his mouth and putting his foot inside.
5494399	5495500	He loves to do that.
5495560	5500625	He's really in touch with the fans thing when it comes to games.
5501306	5509614	So, of course, it's been asked of Randy Pitchford, hey, is Borderlands 4 going to be one of those $80 games when it comes out?
5510795	5515758	And to which, you know, the response was, you know, one, it's not my call.
5516298	5519160	But if you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen.
5519180	5522702	The most non-answer telling answer ever.
5523923	5533609	My local store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 while I was just out of high school working a minimum wage and ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach.
5533669	5535871	He fell right into that fucking trap.
5536291	5537772	He fell right into that fucking trap.
5540948	5550280	Once again, I feel like it goes without saying, and I'm sure you all know it, but I'm going to say it anyways just in case if for some reason you're like, hey, he's got a point there.
5551744	5557266	A game that came out for the Sega Genesis was a complete game.
5557726	5562167	There were no more parts of that game that you would be charged for later on down the road.
5562348	5564748	It was the game that you got.
5564908	5567229	You paid for it and all that stuff.
5567809	5569750	Also, they had rental to go in.
5571110	5571751	Rental as well.
5571771	5574491	There's rental price games as well at some point.
5575092	5575292	But...
5576813	5579797	An $80 game back in 1991 is not the same as an $80 game in 2025.
5579837	5584985	An $80 Borderlands 4 game will come out, but then there's also the $30 or $40 Borderlands.
5591474	5598136	Season Pass, and then all this other DLC and all these other cosmetics and maybe an in-game currency.
5598796	5604818	Who the hell knows what else on top of that that you're going to be charged beyond the $80.
5605498	5607439	$80 is the entry point into that game.
5607799	5609739	It is not the full price of the game.
5610559	5618822	Stop letting these CEOs and these companies try to convince you that, well, it's just, you know, it's just the inflation stuff.
5619582	5625324	Might I remind you that your salaries haven't gone up at the same rate as the inflation has for this stuff.
5625364	5627525	So they can go shove it up their ass.
5628345	5630966	If people want to spend $80 on the game, good.
5631246	5636088	But the expectation that, oh, I need to buy it day one for $80, guess what?
5636148	5638709	This shit goes on sale all the fucking time.
5639169	5639769	So no.
5640410	5643451	No, you do not get $80 just because you're Borderlands 4.
5644844	5669396	Claire Obscure Expedition 33 which will undoubtedly be the game of the year I think that's the most obvious thing I could say right now barring a huge holiday surprise we don't know what Nintendo might pull out for the holidays but barring a huge holiday surprise it is very obvious that game will be game of the year that is a $50 game and the industry just the industry just needs to sit and stare at that all the CEOs just need to sit and stare at that for a little bit
5670799	5683593	and then on top of that he tried to walk it back slightly because he unknowingly got pointed out and he didn't know that the fans would call him out on that he didn't like the pull quotes, yeah
5684159	5691124	It's like, so someone commented on, you know, someone put real fans tweeting to a handsome Jack AI.
5691184	5692805	Ooh, boy, $80 for Fortnite 4?
5692986	5694727	Let me break out the world's tiniest violin.
5695207	5698630	Crafted from iridium and oiled with the tears of my whiny vault hunters.
5698650	5701412	Listen, Cupcake, you're not buying a game, you're investing in it.
5702653	5706716	And then Randy's like, oh, that's, is that how I sound?
5706936	5708457	Oh, in all seriousness, you know.
5709491	5711912	Nobody likes being taken for granted, but that was not my intent.
5712252	5712932	Bullshit!
5713072	5715393	It wasn't your intent.
5715413	5719775	You said, if you're a real fan of this, you're going to give us the full amount of money that we ask for.
5719915	5720655	Fuck you.
5722216	5724016	I want to also read this, then we'll move on.
5724397	5738562	RinMari68 in chat says, As I said earlier, I'd be fine with the argument of games are getting more expensive due to inflation and paying the devs if I could be reassured that most of those $80 go to the people who actually made the fucking game.
5740120	5743504	I said this once to one of their comments before, and I'm going to say it again.
5744025	5744666	Period!
5746868	5750413	I know we got an email tonight, I believe, from the same individual, right, DarkSakura?
5750513	5751794	Let's go to our listener roundtable.
5751875	5754518	Participate at OrangeLondrina.com is the place to send your emails.
5755865	5757065	Hello again, OLR crew.
5757106	5760147	I just want to say thank you for reading and responding to my email from last week.
5760267	5765929	It is Sunday as I write this, and assuming a meteor doesn't hit my house or whatever, I should be good to listen to tonight's episode.
5766589	5770151	So DJ Ranma S says he's in Japan and was around Akihabara.
5770551	5775073	I mentioned to him that he should visit Akihabara Hei, short for Hirose Entertainment Yard.
5775513	5780755	It's a wonderful little arcade, more specifically a specialized branch of the Taito Station franchise.
5781195	5787720	with a whole floor of retro arcade games and two entire rows of retro shmups, shoot-em-ups like Raiden, Gradius, Toho Project.
5788100	5792484	And now I'm going to make myself feel old and say that cave games are retro at this point.
5793324	5798188	I had visited Japan last November, and it was as excellent of an arcade as I expected.
5798468	5807415	All of the shmup cabs have auto-fire buttons, which is great because I'm anti-American and dislike having to type the same button repeatedly and rapidly over the course of a 30-minute game.
5808682	5812526	I also wanted to bring up that this kind of retro arcade is becoming less and less common in Japan.
5812787	5816050	Most arcades I saw were mostly price catcher games.
5816510	5825720	According to a Hamitsu article that interviewed one of the staff of Game Center Mikado, another retro arcade in Tokyo, well, there's three branches and I visited two of them.
5826080	5828683	Only about 30 arcades like this still exist in Japan.
5828843	5830485	Of the big chain arcades that have
5830945	5832346	more than UFO catcher games.
5832906	5839910	Usually they will have a ton of rhythm games, those weird gacha card games, video game mahjong, and not much else for video games.
5841531	5855279	At least I played a ton of Tunism, the rhythm game with a touch lighter and an air sensor that you wave your hands through, to unlock a song that an acquaintance of mine made, La Symphonie des Célestia Agony Movement.
5856559	5859301	I think that's about my main arcade rhythm game at this point.
5859721	5869566	I find this and Sega's other rhythm games, MaiMai, Ongeki, more appealing at this point due to their well-refined mechanics, and they've basically been a competitor to Bamani for the last decade.
5870126	5872547	I did get to play the newest Bamani game, Polaris Chord.
5873147	5875849	It's sort of a cross between Chinnithim and Sound Vortex.
5876349	5879510	I thought it was a neat idea, but I really didn't like it had gacha elements, too.
5880231	5884213	I kind of wish I'd gotten to check out Japanese arcades maybe 20 or even 10 years ago.
5885538	5889182	They're still well afloat, and their machines are still well taken care of.
5889382	5892785	The variety in those arcades is not as diverse as it used to be.
5893286	5895768	As such, I try to enjoy these arcades when I get a chance.
5897010	5900433	They're already dead-ish in America, and they're on their way to that in Japan, too.
5901134	5902955	Anyways, thank you for reading this email.
5903036	5905478	It's great to be listening to OLR full-time again.
5905618	5906519	I'll see you folks at 6.
5907240	5908221	Rin Mari, Clarita.
5910120	5915365	Thank you for the state of the different arcades you were able to visit over in Japan.
5915505	5919589	I can't wait to hear about Ranma's experience too when he's back from his trip.
5920149	5921310	I'd still love to go someday.
5921350	5922591	Y'all know I've never been to Japan.
5923072	5924433	I'd love to go at some point.
5925394	5928377	I'll tell you what, my desire to go to Kyoto has stopped.
5928597	5929518	It's completely over.
5930103	5931423	Wow, what happened?
5932064	5936025	Seeing how tourists... Well, okay, I want to go to Kyoto, but I don't want to do the tourist things.
5936485	5940486	Because right now, tourists in Kyoto are fucking everything up for everybody.
5941046	5942707	The locals are angry.
5943167	5952930	You have people who are completely disrespecting shrines, littering, trying to destroy ancient bamboo forests by just being absolute idiots.
5953590	5958314	Just and completely, you know, hogging up the bus system and everything.
5958814	5960256	And I don't want to contribute to that.
5961517	5976069	I'm thinking if I go to Kyoto, I want to go to the places that are off the beaten path or maybe to some of the other shrine towns and go actually be respectful instead of, you know, being a stupid Westerner.
5980123	5981085	I have a few friends living there.
5990916	5991256	All right.
5992036	5994677	Well, that does it for our listener roundtable tonight.
5994998	6000400	If you want to send us some emails in our future week, participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send an email.
6000820	6003441	So that takes us to last minute stories.
6003541	6006002	I don't know if we have anything, Loki, but I'll check in with you.
6006042	6009663	No, that's nothing else other than what we just talked about with Michael Bay.
6010143	6010464	All right.
6010524	6010924	Fair enough.
6011664	6011964	All right.
6012044	6013906	Well, then we're going to wrap it up for the night.
6013946	6017789	I know it's a little bit early, but I have plans after the show because this is a three-day weekend this week.
6018289	6023393	And I think I noticed there's less people watching live tonight probably also because it is a three-day weekend.
6023673	6025255	And so folks are out doing things.
6025475	6026776	So all's good.
6027556	6030437	Thank you for being here whether you were live or on the podcast feed.
6030477	6032178	We appreciate your participation either way.
6032778	6033559	Super appreciate that.
6033919	6036520	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
6036800	6041102	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6041442	6045363	A nice five-star review on a place like Apple Podcasts or Spotify or YouTube.
6045763	6046944	And yes, I saw the YouTube comment.
6048066	6048986	Will you say something, Jamie?
6049386	6051167	No.
6051267	6055488	A nice five-star review on those places going an awful long way, and we really appreciate those as well.
6055848	6061350	But at the end of the day, a social media repost or anything like that, that all helps as well.
6061470	6061710	Okay.
6062990	6065711	With that, we're going to get to final thoughts tonight.
6066471	6069612	DarkSakura, you are streaming tonight after the show for a little bit, right?
6070894	6088320	I am and I do in this case ask that if we have people show up, stay because I'm going to be raiding Nick and Prince later who is, like I said, doing stream for a cause and I'm going to see if I can do some 2v8 in Dead by Daylight when Nick wakes up from his nappy naps.
6090041	6090381	Alright.
6092262	6098104	Then we'll go over to... Actually, I'll just say bye to you, DarkSakura, so you can go off and get your stream started, but we'll see you next week.
6101069	6108403	and meanwhile we'll go over to Loki with your final thoughts tonight, Loki my final thought is hopefully I have my episode out this week or something else
6111198	6111998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6135066	6140010	I will play lots of time-wasting games like I usually do throughout the week.
6140470	6141851	Have a great week, everybody.
