39161	45984	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46084	48585	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49245	57528	Live tonight with episode number 1039 for tonight, March the 23rd of 2025, where we always get it right on the first take.
57628	60909	So you should always be here to see it live because we never make mistakes.
61630	63490	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm perfect.
63510	63890	Thank you.
63950	65851	And I'm joined by the always perfect.
66171	67792	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
69144	69985	You're perfect.
70085	71446	You look like a model.
71726	73107	Like Linda Evangelista.
73127	73587	Thank you.
73968	74408	Thank you.
74508	79512	I actually don't have a voice very much because I just got over a cold.
79592	81273	What super spreader event did you attend?
82434	83375	I went to work.
83975	84516	Oh, okay.
86777	90040	Yeah, those whole back in office mandates are real useful, aren't they?
91721	94263	I actually had an x-ray for my leg.
94343	95164	Nothing's broken.
95484	95824	Oh, no.
96264	96885	Two months later.
98404	98644	What?
98684	99925	A little whore?
99945	100106	What?
100126	100226	No.
120563	123065	A little horror show.
123385	126187	The camp classic sleepaway camp from the 80s.
126588	128469	We were doing a live screening with the star.
128509	130110	She was like 13 when she was in the movies.
130431	132032	And she's in her 50s now because it's an old movie.
132052	134374	Was it a live screening or a live screaming?
134394	135575	It was all of the above.
135855	136736	It was all of the above.
136896	137556	It was a good time.
137596	139758	And did you wear your sunscreen?
140739	142340	To an indoor at night event?
142400	143381	Yes, of course I did.
143421	144962	Yes, always wear your sunscreen.
144982	145062	Okay.
146243	147847	There's radiation everywhere, Rob.
147887	151095	Technically, the little face wash I use is sunscreen.
151215	153160	So, I mean, yes, I wore sunscreen.
153180	154924	You want to know what's funny?
156178	158400	This face wash is like have stuff in them.
158720	163724	They don't really do any good unless you like leave them on your face for a couple of minutes before you wash them off.
163804	165125	Actually, I do do that in the shower.
165665	165925	I do.
166045	166566	I'll do that.
166606	173971	And then I kind of not that you all need to know my shower routine, but I will I will soap other things that need soaping while while that is resting.
174151	175873	This is your skincare PSA.
175893	176413	That's right.
176773	179015	This is how I look so fucking good approaching 50.
179115	180316	Just thank you very much.
182738	183078	What?
184059	185440	You know what's happening next month.
186969	189610	Uh, you're having a sub-a-thon because you want money.
189830	190790	Oh yeah, it's your birthday too.
192590	193431	I'm going to be 49.
194171	196011	Congratulations, but you're still not 50.
196231	196911	You're not approaching 50.
197031	200452	I am.
200872	203173	I'm knock, knock, knocking on 50's doors.
203273	204933	I have a whore in that race, okay?
205093	206453	You're kicking down that door.
207213	208194	I have a whore in that race.
209294	209714	I mean horse.
211191	224268	Alright, anyway, let's say hello to another old horse here on the program Always tip and respect your sex workers But, younger than DarkSakura myself, say hello to TechMasterLoki Hello Hi Loki, how are you?
226914	239366	I noticed tonight as we're taping live, because let's get this plug out, we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
239406	240407	You can catch us live.
240467	242409	Again, we always get it right on the first take.
242429	247274	We would never have microphone fails or OBS suddenly deciding to switch audio devices.
247374	247614	Why?
247634	249396	Because we can, or maybe...
249636	250256	I remember drivers.
250276	250756	How quaint.
276466	290197	I only drive when it's Forza Horizon Put that on a t-shirt Or if I'm Loki, this is another case I would drive Playing F-Zero GX, which I noticed you have playing behind you tonight Oh, sorry, this is AX, the arcade one Oh, shit
290717	291738	Good times.
291938	292498	Oh my god.
292598	311588	I know we've reminisced on the show before, but y'all have to know that we are – look, we talk about how we're old, but I want to tell you all we are privileged to have lived at the same time as A, Dolly Parton, and B, F-Zero AX in the arcades and actually getting to go to what, Sunnyvale Golf Land or who had that machine?
311648	312068	Sunnyvale had it.
312088	312568	Yeah, Sunnyvale Golf Land.
312888	323937	Somebody else had it, maybe a place in Vegas, and actually get to play F-Zero AX, taking our fucking GameCube memory cards, putting it in the machine because you unlock... People forget this.
324297	328140	This is the one time I'm ever going to say Nintendo was ahead of its time.
328260	330041	Actually, I'm not, because sometimes...
331022	338888	Sometimes they actually, it's one of those like the correct fool who ends up doing something wrong but ends up getting it right.
338948	340429	But Nintendo totally got it right here.
340789	346373	You would put your GameCube memory card in the F-Zero AX machine and you could fucking unlock the tracks for the home version.
346714	348235	And this is why I have been saying,
349075	351437	I'm going blue in the face saying this too much.
351778	356742	And I hope to God, maybe Switch 2 has the mystical, magical hardware that will let it happen.
357202	360645	Re-release F-Zero GX, you cowards.
361126	368732	And now just flip the magic switch, have a little save file by default with all the AX tracks unlocked.
368972	372636	Because I'm telling you, like 95% of the people that played F-Zero never saw those tracks.
373436	374998	So it'd be amazing.
375816	385543	which were really just reroutes like they were they were just reroutes of existing tracks in the game I don't think there was anything like completely original but still you guys will yeah
386457	390802	Yeah, or as SSJ100Mac calls it, Rob going big blue in the face.
391002	391563	Exactly.
392204	402115	And technically, I think there's either a developer code or a GameShark code that you can put in to actually unlock.
403496	405178	It's like an AX mode even.
405398	406760	Like they have like a whole...
407478	407798	F-Zero GX
426294	429455	Y'all are going to hate me for suggesting this, but Nintendo could sell them both.
429956	431016	Nintendo should sell both.
431036	431977	They could sell them separately.
432077	435858	Sell AX and sell GX, and then let people share the same file between them.
435938	436959	People will buy them both.
437279	437659	I'm sorry.
437719	439860	I know you all are going to hate me for saying it, but let's be real.
440220	441641	I need Nintendo's attention.
442281	443042	I need their attention.
443062	448764	AX goes on the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass, and then you sell the other game, and then it unlocks tracks on the other game.
448784	449284	Done and done.
449324	449905	For the record...
450945	459586	If anyone wants, I do have the GameShark or whatever codes there were for F-Zero AX on GameCube.
459666	460187	Amazing.
460727	461187	Amazing.
462267	464447	Oh, Bobby, I did not realize this.
464547	470248	Bobby said AX tracks also unlocked if you beat all the cups on Master Difficulty.
470368	471288	I never realized that.
471649	472709	I wasn't that good.
473529	475689	I wasn't as good as Bobby Blackwolf, clearly.
476409	479230	Well, this is a way, I guess, for non...
480959	502149	expert players yeah but hey the arcade though it tilted the one we had oh my god it did yeah it was you would actually go let you could go pretty high i don't think you went full sideways but you went a good like 45 degree angle either way it was so fun it was pretty cool so fun all right which which obviously means it didn't last at golf land so you know
503052	506073	All right, well, let's go from what, 2002 or whenever that game came out?
506093	507854	Let's go from 2002 to 2025.
508895	510996	Game Developers Conference happened this week.
511636	518119	Totally, I knew it was, I always forget that that is actually during the week because it is for the industry.
518139	519419	It is for people that work in the industry.
519740	520480	So it is a week.
520600	521360	Day Conference.
521440	523401	I'm always like, oh, GDC is this weekend.
523441	524502	And it's like, no, idiot.
524562	525362	It happened during the week.
525822	528644	So I did have a friend that went and said they got a lot out of it.
528664	529484	They had a really good time.
530104	531925	Who works in the industry and has reasons to go.
532806	534386	So yeah, it sounds like GDC was a good time.
534446	543611	Now, we don't usually get a lot of gaming news out of GDC, but we have a few things tonight, including, I think, something that plays into...
544611	551956	How the industry's kind of been for the last year and some of the not so great things and some of the changes that are happening as a result.
552436	555138	Loki, I'm going to turn this over to you to kick us off tonight.
556138	571288	Yeah, so they announced the formation of the United Video Game Workers CWA, which was an industry-wide union formed by Code CWA and CWA Union.
572528	591125	and uh so now they have basically almost like a SAG-AFTRA type of uh union that is not just centric to like one company for example it is just game developers as a whole across the board which I think gives them a little bit more leveraging power to you know get uh
591966	610745	better compensations you get you know better benefits that type of stuff protections um but yeah they said to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers but also to build large scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry um
611368	613070	So that's what they were doing.
613150	618434	And it says for two thirds of the modern industrial history, there were no legal forms of unions.
619715	625360	They were just humans coming together to organize as best they could to leverage against their employers for better conditions.
626641	633167	But of course, you know, nowadays, you know, it seems to be very anti-union and very like
634400	648446	you know, capitalistic in the sense that they're looking to exploit their workers and stuff we've had lots of stories about different layouts and whatnot but yeah, it's good to see that they're all more united front with that type of stuff
650871	658237	It's going to be interesting to see how this develops, especially now that there is that more, like, anybody can access this type of thing, right?
658257	660219	So you might see more smaller companies.
660599	668626	I don't necessarily want to say indie, because I feel like indie is its own thing, but definitely like small, you know, there's video game studios out there that are, what, less than 20 people, easy.
669167	673070	I want to say, like, Hello Games, I think, who makes No Man's Sky, is a very small studio.
673090	677634	Yeah, certainly, and let's not say that, like, you know, it's not going to necessarily be...
679090	706623	perfect in the indie studios but a lot of the times the stuff that you see where you have you know exploit workers being exploited and stuff tends to be in the more larger studios where they're kind of beholden to shareholders and infinite growth and that type of stuff not to say that you know smaller studios don't have like crunch and other things that aren't necessarily good business practices anyways but um yeah it'll be interesting to see how that actually works out
707796	728865	Yeah, I think all of us have predicted some time ago that with all these layoffs that have been happening and the workers getting treated poorly and some of the things that came out of the dark parts of Activision Blizzard a few years ago, especially during COVID that led to all the protests, I think we all kind of foresaw that more and more people were going to unionize within the industry.
728945	731466	So it's interesting to see it happen at this level.
731546	733787	And honestly, it just sounds like it's needed.
734267	740069	Like, you know, with how long people work, we all know about the horrors of crunch time.
740149	745452	And, you know, I understand once in a while you got to do that to meet some deadlines and get the product out on shelves.
745492	750454	But at the same time, it's like, wait, sometimes it feels like... Don't make it an expectation, make it an exception.
750474	751074	Exactly.
751494	755856	Too many companies are building it into part of their, you know, development plan.
755896	757736	And it's just, it's getting ridiculous.
758277	763299	So, you know, happy workers will inevitably make better games.
764338	768199	So, well, I'm happy for the industry.
768219	769740	That's why happy cows make better cheese, right?
769760	771080	Better milk.
771100	775902	Alright, we're going to move on to the next segment.
775922	777902	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games.
777922	778443	Let's move on.
778463	778943	That's right.
779903	780983	You see what I did there.
781464	785045	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
785085	785525	DarkSakura.
787628	789209	I played some Dead by Daylight.
789429	795573	It's Chaos Shuffle again, and I'm like, meh, meh, meh, meh about it.
796773	800696	Otherwise, I played some Monster Hunter Wilds.
800736	805118	I'm still getting used to the control scheme, which honestly sucks.
806519	809221	Even though I know it's been the same one always, it still sucks.
812022	813463	I played Bell Outro.
814525	816766	a lot of it during my breaks.
817886	818487	I like that game.
819087	821808	I didn't think I would like it, but I like it.
823729	826170	I have... I also played some Palia.
826190	830231	I played... What else did I play?
830752	832052	Shit, I don't remember what else I played.
833433	833813	I'm old.
834553	836534	Oh yeah, Dragon Age.
837595	838295	And yeah.
838315	840316	Alright.
841356	842797	Well then we will move over to Loki.
842877	843477	How was your gaming week?
844700	846982	It's basically the same as every other week.
847202	848123	It's been Minecraft.
848143	849444	You're going to surprise me someday.
851426	853448	Maybe someday, yeah.
853848	855009	I still need to play Avowed.
855669	863416	But no, it's been mainly just Minecraft and then a little bit of Lotro in between everything.
863596	865037	A lot of content creation stuff.
865317	866819	Your latest video looked really good.
868487	869187	It was alright.
869347	869688	I don't know.
869848	871468	What the fuck, Loki?
871508	873529	You gotta be your own hype man over there.
873849	875230	Your latest video looked good.
875290	876030	Yes, it did.
876190	876731	Yes, it did.
876791	879512	Loki, you know what you gotta do?
880072	880732	You gotta believe.
881713	882813	He's gotta do what?
882933	883813	He's gotta do what?
888524	889505	It's got to be speed.
889985	890746	But it's fine.
890786	896671	We take the alright ones because otherwise you're spending a month editing something.
899333	902836	It's what comes with the territory when you're putting out weekly content.
903316	907020	And so I'm fine with it being okay right now.
907180	909121	It is kind of in a rush.
909602	910322	There's a lot of...
911630	912410	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
941630	942771	Loki, you're the worst.
943032	945955	This is why you're not getting the subs.
945975	949018	You are the worst hype man.
949318	949719	It's fair.
949759	951541	Believe in yourself as much as we do.
952061	953322	No, I believe in myself.
953342	955304	I'm just saying that the end is pretty boring.
956326	961651	Yeah, the shaders make it look nice, but it's one of the things that everybody keeps complaining.
961731	964194	Like, hey, you guys need to do an end update because...
965526	967988	It's pretty boring, you know, like there's nothing in there.
968128	972671	There's not a lot of reason to go there outside of like Shulker Shells and Elytra.
974493	981778	So, I mean, it could be better, but yeah, I mean, the shaders definitely make it look nice.
982259	987603	And, you know, we'll be talking about updates later on that are going to be coming very soon.
988363	990105	Old promises coming back.
990765	993047	So it's it'll be fun.
993757	994097	All right.
994677	995938	Well, no, do check out the video.
996198	996698	It's great.
996858	999839	And honestly, Loki's got a great collection on his YouTube.
1000299	1001319	We all do stuff on the side.
1001399	1002560	DarkSakura, of course, has Twitch.
1002760	1003560	We just talked about that.
1004720	1009662	I guess, I mean, a lot of my time has been with the live hosting stuff, so it's a little harder to find.
1009722	1017244	But, you know, I try to get back on Twitch once in a while, but it is, I'm going to be honest, it's been kind of hard to make time, intentional time for Twitch lately.
1017284	1018405	And I'm just kind of, I'm,
1019085	1020106	I'm just making the most of it
1026946	1027387	Let's see.
1028467	1029167	My gaming week.
1029187	1034629	So therefore, my gaming week, I don't have as much to talk about, but it's mostly the usual suspects, right?
1034729	1036070	You know, like Pokemon Go.
1036170	1038831	I did the Totodile Day and caught more Shinies.
1038911	1039191	Why?
1039311	1040551	I don't know, because I feel the need.
1041592	1044493	You know, and Ingress and Pikmin and other geolocation games.
1044813	1046173	A little bit more Diablo 4.
1046313	1050715	I am now on tier 89 out of 90 for this season, so I'm almost done.
1051155	1053437	I don't think I'm going to do the full completion of the quest.
1053477	1056680	I think you unlock like a Raven pet or something, but it's just not worth it.
1056760	1065027	I need to focus on beating some other games or continuing down the rabbit hole of things like Final Fantasy XIV, which has a big patch coming on Tuesday.
1065147	1069531	So therefore, I've been working very hard on the limited time cosmetic event that they're running.
1069571	1071413	They do this Moogle Tome event is what they call it.
1071713	1099446	and they usually run it to try to keep people sort of engaged in the game before a patch because they know the content gets a little dry so they run some like really hard to get cosmetics normally from previous expansions we'll come back again for Moogle Tomes and running dungeons and helping people with the game and stuff like that so I have now hit 100 on Scholar which also means 100 on Summoner which I never play Summoner but I always play Scholar because it's the one job in the game that's kind of linked it's
1100706	1110768	1.0 did this weird shit where you had your class before you had your job and then so Arcanist can lead to both Scholar and Summoner.
1110868	1113809	So when you level anything in the Arcanist tree, you're leveling both.
1113929	1116129	I know it sounds complicated because it is.
1116449	1120410	Because Final Fantasy XIV's biggest problem is the fact that it was built on top of 1.0.
1120630	1126912	The creamy, gooey center of that game is still Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 which was what?
1127372	1127852	Horrible.
1128252	1128532	So
1129492	1134153	And someday, they're really going to have to commit to uncoupling themselves.
1134293	1138954	That's going to take a major world-changing expansion to do that, but they need to do it.
1139574	1140714	Swear to God, they need to do it.
1140814	1145815	Or they're just going to, at some point, they're just going to say, Final Fantasy XVII online, let's go.
1145915	1149255	And of course I'll be there, because I'm a sucker for Square Enix online games.
1149736	1151896	I wish they'd still bring Dragon Quest X over here.
1152576	1155317	I wish we'd get online, or the offline Dragon Quest.
1155537	1157637	I'll take either, online or offline Dragon Quest X.
1158550	1159891	I'm sure they'll come over eventually.
1159911	1161553	I don't see why they couldn't.
1161753	1168039	Well, and then I want Square to do a Final Fantasy XI offline, which I guess most of the game is solo at this point.
1168319	1170041	Yeah, I know, right?
1170081	1170821	Come on!
1171322	1177788	Did you know that the latest raid in Final Fantasy XIV, the 24-man content, is Final Fantasy XI themed?
1178288	1178408	What?
1178448	1178528	What?
1178869	1179129	What?
1196451	1217265	are in an area that is literally a copy of Upper Juno with like the auction house and everything except everything is like different looking and you see ghost figures where NPCs would have been in 11 and then there's all these different characters there from 14 and then you actually do the raid and you fight like the Shadow Lord is the last boss so it's
1218986	1219346	It's neat.
1219386	1222049	And they use, and yes, they bring back the battle music from Eleven.
1227293	1228914	So Eleven had a great soundtrack.
1229414	1233958	If y'all never played Eleven, and I understand why a lot of people didn't touch Eleven.
1233998	1236260	It did not have the quality of life Perks of 14 have.
1236700	1239162	But Eleven has a banger soundtrack.
1239322	1239882	It really does.
1239902	1240603	I played Eleven.
1241324	1246112	I don't know what the battle music sounded like because I had it swapped out with Final Fantasy X music.
1246172	1246653	Oh, that's right.
1246693	1247995	You had it Zanarkand.
1248495	1251120	I forgot about that.
1251160	1251981	That's right.
1253047	1281542	so Loki and I used to live together years ago and when he would, let's say we were in a Valcrum Dooms, like we would play Eleven together, like on computers, like right next to each other and we would be in a Valcrum Dooms party and then it's like somebody engages a crab and then like, you know, I'm hearing the normal battle music and then over from Loki's computer I'm hearing, change my pitch up, smack my bitch up it was I mean, it was epic it was great it's the most late 90s, early aughts thing ever
1282563	1284864	And then, oh, what was the other one?
1284904	1291847	The other one was the Chocobo music was replaced with the Falkor's theme.
1291867	1293388	Yes, you had the never-ending story music.
1293648	1294308	Oh, my God.
1294368	1295649	Yeah.
1295669	1296569	Oh, so cool.
1296989	1297670	All right, anyway.
1298550	1305617	I just remember playing that game with a controller and being able to pull off all of my macros with my bonus buttons on my controller.
1306158	1307259	It's such a great game.
1307279	1309321	Yeah, it was built for the PS2.
1309461	1311343	So yeah, controllers worked really well in that game.
1311383	1313405	Controllers work well on 14 also.
1313985	1316207	I found a better way.
1317992	1324580	I need, like, a way to emulate Eleven offline and just play, like, on or something like that.
1324940	1326522	Like, that would be amazing.
1326723	1332529	So, I really shouldn't endorse this because Final Fantasy is still a live continuing service.
1332630	1333070	However...
1333931	1341534	You know, recently... But I firmly believe it is a service that should be rolled up into one fee with Final Fantasy XIV at this point.
1341574	1342354	I'd gladly pay it.
1344355	1348016	We can call it... What would we call it instead of Xbox Game Pass?
1348176	1349596	Squeenix Squeepass.
1349636	1350397	The Squeepass!
1351217	1355839	The Squeepass should have Final Fantasy XIV and XI.
1355879	1356419	And what else?
1356719	1358760	It could have that fucking triple triad from XI.
1358980	1361280	Remember there was a separate XI triple triad thing?
1361861	1362321	It could have that.
1362401	1362521	Look.
1363041	1363962	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1382813	1394418	but you should look on there about how people talk about how to play Final Fantasy XI on the emulated PS2 when the PS2 and Xbox 360 versions were taken down a long time ago.
1395078	1396138	Wink wink, nudge nudge.
1396738	1410464	Yeah, I have to look and see how to do that because another thing I've been looking at recently is getting one of those because I have a lot of actual systems but I want one of those cheap I just want one of those cheap
1411377	1436776	you know, emulation handhelds that you can just dump a bunch of ROMs on play stuff so like a Steam Deck but like off-brand but it would be like Android based or something like that just something cheap but they have them now, I mean technology is to a point where Playstation 2 is easy peasy to emulate that for the most part so I'm like portable Final Fantasy 11?
1436876	1437116	maybe
1440259	1443461	So watch, we're going to get to our gaming weeks in like three weeks.
1443522	1445863	And Loki's going to be like, I didn't play Minecraft this week.
1446164	1446764	What did you play?
1446844	1447865	Final Fantasy XI.
1447985	1448906	And how did you do that?
1449226	1450307	Can't talk about it.
1453949	1455831	As he holds up a portable system.
1456191	1456471	All right.
1457452	1462516	Let's get into some other games that people get very excited about as we get into some gaming news.
1462656	1465338	And this is, I heard you like collecting.
1465378	1467720	So I'm going to put some collecting in your collecting, right, Loki?
1467740	1467820	Yeah.
1469351	1470532	Yes, absolutely.
1470652	1482137	So this is kind of cool because for the longest time, Lego hasn't had the rights to Pokemon as far as putting out Nintendo products.
1482177	1484538	No, another company called Mega had it.
1484598	1487199	I'm looking down because I have a Mega Block thing here.
1487279	1489240	Mega Blocks, Mega Constructs.
1489720	1491460	I was a big fan of Constructs back in the 80s.
1492221	1492961	That was my jam.
1493101	1493641	Also Legos.
1493661	1497103	But, you know, back then it's like your kid, you're like, hey...
1498567	1499487	Do the blocks push?
1499767	1501248	Can I use these blocks with Legos?
1501588	1501828	Yes.
1502028	1502569	Okay, cool.
1502909	1503729	It's fine with me.
1504189	1506330	I'm not like, oh, it has to be Lego.
1506690	1513433	But anyways, yeah, Mega has had the rights to the Pokemon franchise for a long time.
1514033	1516114	And to be honest, their sets aren't bad.
1516674	1517334	They really aren't.
1517534	1518955	I've gotten a few of them for my son.
1519095	1519615	I had a
1520055	1548225	you know like a 12 inch tall Pikachu and stuff like that and they're really cool and they've had some really cool sets but now uh starting in 2026 the rights are going to be going back to Lego and they're going to have the rights the exclusive rights I assume to make Pokemon products um so yeah be interesting to see what they come up with because honestly like I said you know the the mega stuff it wasn't all that bad like I don't know I don't know why
1548567	1552610	Well, the hate was for, but, like, it'd be interesting.
1552850	1556333	They have a lot of cool sets coming out Nintendo-wise.
1556753	1560656	Like, I gotta get that Mario Kart one that's coming out in, like, two months here, but one month.
1560796	1561656	Oh, yeah, one month.
1561776	1562397	May 1st, I think.
1563918	1569062	Looking in chat, S2100Matt says, the fandom surcharge will be real with those sets and will gladly pay it.
1569162	1569542	Yeah.
1569702	1570803	Yes, you will.
1571023	1572604	So that is a thing.
1572664	1576107	Like, that is one of the things with the Mega sets is...
1577202	1599265	they weren't super expensive like Nintendo and well Nintendo and Lego are very much like they are premium price sets so that is the only downside with that um but it's fine I mean I would say if you're interested you will be tested how bad do you want this Pikachu you will be tested
1599947	1603110	I gotta be honest, the Pikachu set that's out now, they have multiples.
1603150	1605571	They have one that animates, it looks like it's running.
1605932	1609434	They have another one you can get with Ash and Pikachu, I think.
1609514	1616880	It's a full, not full-sized Ash, but obviously it's a pretty decent-sized Ash and Pikachu.
1617701	1624325	There's a lot of good sets out there, so if you're really interested in getting one of those and you don't want to pay the premium...
1625106	1627168	Then I would say, you know, check that out.
1627688	1630651	I hope these are minifig scale sets would be kind of cool.
1631472	1639620	I mean, obviously they'll do some larger stuff, but I think it'd be really cool to have like actual, you know, like ash minifigs and stuff like that, you know, all that, but...
1641081	1644824	And honestly, check those clearance bins at wherever you're shopping.
1644884	1647806	I don't know where people are shopping these days because everybody's pissed at Target.
1647886	1654491	But that's where I know in the past I got my Mega Block set for, I have a Squirtle, came from Target.
1655091	1659254	And when the Pokemon Lego things start coming in, the Mega ones are going to end up in the clearance bins.
1659314	1663237	You probably can get some of those for real cheap as they offload them.
1663297	1663958	So keep an eye out.
1664795	1692485	yeah and they're around I mean there's a lot of places that'll sell those because like they don't move very fast but they have a lot of cool stuff they have a little pixel like you can do they're like little mosaics that are the sprites from the Game Boy version stuff like that that are pretty cool with all the starters at least quite a few of the starters I mean there's a lot of sets out there I really recommend you go check them out before the Lego stuff comes out and obviously that's still a year away so we got time
1693480	1701314	As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, the thing that I hope doesn't happen is that whenever they do minifigs of Pokemon, that the Pokemon scalpers don't make it miserable.
1701715	1705582	Lego is pretty good at flooding the market where it is not a thing for scalpers to be bums.
1706297	1709459	Yeah, I don't think it's going to be an issue, but yeah, it sucks.
1709659	1711580	Yeah, reasonable concern.
1712360	1715061	You know what they could do that would be fucked up?
1715241	1715982	Oh, my God.
1716302	1719944	I want to do this just because of my friend Shane, who's obsessed with Shinies.
1720404	1728768	What if one in every 256 boxes, the bricks were different colors and they let you build shiny Pokemon?
1732463	1734365	I mean, I don't know if they would do that.
1749426	1750327	Don't give them ideas.
1750507	1751848	They've already had the idea.
1752288	1758331	Well, so apparently the next, so the trading card pocket game, I didn't talk about it in my game movie.
1758431	1760332	I still play that just about every day.
1761873	1765816	Mike Def said, I stopped my Bellatro session to yell at Rob.
1765896	1766256	I love it.
1768217	1771458	I still play the Pokemon trading card game just about every day.
1771578	1772838	I've been slacking a little bit.
1773579	1775299	Those of you that play the game know how it goes.
1775620	1784803	Sometimes you open the game and it says max number of packs available, two packs available, which means you've been getting your unoptimal number of packs per day.
1784843	1788184	And it's like, oh, fuck, I missed out on getting my maximum number of packs.
1788204	1788945	Yeah.
1790265	1811971	so um apparently the next pack that is coming to that game next week is like a shiny themed pack and I was like oh fuck does that mean you only have like one in 256 chance or something to pull a shiny card but apparently no apparently it is at least in chat please correct me if I'm wrong because sometimes I'm wrong on this stuff um
1812111	1814552	Okay, so Mike Def says it's just shiny art, so that's good.
1814572	1814732	Okay.
1834301	1842727	But, you know, imagine that game has been doing pretty well and they're starting to crank out the expansions a little more often.
1843928	1844528	How about that?
1845169	1849552	Oh, Def says it's also the same card with the same effects and stats.
1849572	1854776	Well, that makes sense because isn't that the way the foil... No, sometimes the foils will have like an extra move or something, huh?
1855316	1859437	So I'm not, and you guys have to remember, I'm not as deep down the well of the trading card game.
1859898	1875663	I never touched it before that phone game, but I've got to say, the trading card pocket game, like, I hate to hype a game that I'm not being paid to do, but it's very addicting and fun to just collect the cards, even if you don't really play the game in it.
1876243	1876383	So...
1877557	1881939	Alright, yeah, Def says that's what they normally do with the shiny sets in the real-life card game.
1882079	1882959	Alright, that's good to know.
1883360	1883700	Interesting.
1884480	1888042	Alright, anyway, I don't know how we got from LEGO Pokemon to that, but we did.
1888462	1891663	So, let's move on and talk about... How do we get to any topic?
1891723	1894705	That's right, because the tangent train says... Beep, beep, I'm here.
1894725	1895405	You do.
1896105	1904291	Uh, let's talk about... We mentioned on the show a few weeks ago that Good Old Games, or GOG, was going to be starting this preservation program.
1904331	1911216	And I think at the time, we'd kind of said, well, isn't this just a rebrand of kind of like what they're already talking about doing anyway?
1911576	1912617	Which is, you know, they want to...
1913397	1923121	And I understand that, you know, a lot more gamers are being aware of this idea that sometimes games are no longer available.
1923161	1930303	They're no longer playable because maybe they were online only or they, you know, they're on a system that's very hard to find copies.
1930363	1936646	I think just earlier in chat, DarkTetsuya was saying something about trying to get a copy of F-Zero GX now.
1936666	1937066	Yeah.
1937526	1964272	is dollars like it's it's not a cheap game um it's probably not as expensive as like some of the Saturn classics that Jamie brings up on the show but I it's probably cost more than you know it did when it came out so good old games you know their original sort of MO was uh releasing classic games and then to try to turn a better profit they started kind of getting in the market of current games as well but it's all DRM free and has manuals all this stuff
1964932	1966112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1993837	1998579	So, this week, GOG announced Silent Hill for The Room.
1999140	2000120	That's kind of surprising.
2000160	2001501	Isn't that kind of out of left field?
2002461	2004302	I think that was a better game than people give it credit for.
2004402	2006043	That's not left field.
2006063	2007304	That's somebody else's field.
2009805	2010565	But it's a good pick.
2012139	2012799	I like the room.
2013279	2016241	So yeah, Silent Hill 4 is going to get added to that.
2016321	2018762	Deus Ex, which a lot of people love that game.
2019062	2022063	The original Fear is also joining that as well.
2022123	2029326	In fact, they are saying 20 new games being added to that, including, oh my god, this makes me happy, all 8
2030726	2031346	Wing Commander 1 and 2
2045467	2052634	That's brilliant because I think a lot of people try to go back and play Wing Commander 1 and 2 and the clock speed is way too fast.
2052914	2057579	And I know there's tools out there to adjust, play with them, find the right setting, all that stuff.
2058039	2064085	So I just love that people can now experience the classic fucking... These are like... Y'all have to remember for...
2065066	2066007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2084246	2091711	Port Royale 3 Gold, Alien Breed and Tower Assault, Privateer 2 The Darkening, and Cannon Fodder and Cannon Fodder 2.
2091771	2093392	That's all the games going into the program now.
2094312	2097394	So that's – I will give credit where credit is due.
2097834	2102037	When I first talked about this, I was like, this is just kind of like a marketing thing for GOG.
2102077	2104038	It's just to remind people they sell the classic games.
2104599	2110502	The fact that they are coming back and saying we're adding more and they're – these aren't – some of these are –
2111843	2115605	There's big games coming to this that will probably catch your attention.
2115645	2119767	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf saying, Wing Commander 1 and 2 was my jam.
2119927	2121068	I can't run them on my 486.
2122289	2123089	Too fast.
2123970	2125571	Exactly.
2125731	2128532	But now you can run them with this program.
2128612	2129653	So I think that's great.
2129873	2131274	So kudos.
2131914	2133214	DarkSakura with other stuff out of GDC.
2158901	2166666	Yeah, so there was, of course, the Game Developers Choice Award 2025 and Game of the Year is Bellagio.
2167687	2169368	Yay, Kermit Flail.
2170448	2174130	Anyway, I really don't think anyone is super surprised.
2174170	2177713	I mean, that's kind of surprised because, I mean, there was what else?
2177833	2178573	Astro Bot.
2179574	2179854	Astro Bot.
2180919	2199345	Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Astro Bot I'm not even seeing it on the list at all I see Astro Bot for Best Technology and Bellator won Game of the Year and Best Design and Innovation Award and Best Debut so I wouldn't say it's a total sweep but it was pretty big
2201127	2204169	This is a good year for an indie to really be celebrated like that.
2204329	2206591	Even if I've talked about how Bellatro didn't click for me.
2206611	2212175	But boy, the more my co-hosts talk about playing it all the time, I'm like, I really need to just suck it up and try it again.
2212476	2214777	And now it's on Xbox Game Pass too.
2215798	2220942	So it was on Steam and I play through Apple Arcade now.
2221903	2229729	And what I really dig with it is just that it's something that I can have open on the side while I'm doing other things.
2231246	2256114	you know so like if I'm say watching a documentary you know because you know me I love documentaries then I might keep it open just to have something to do with my hands while I'm watching something I thought it was your Chinese 90s dramas or whatever was your thing okay so uh-oh uh-oh she done went there when I was she done went there when I was watching I finished the one um
2258636	2261398	I started another one to realize I'd actually already watched it.
2262779	2265361	It was actually a sequel to the one, so I started another one.
2265982	2267203	And I've detected a theme.
2268304	2281614	I've detected that when the women in the harem hit that point where they have had too much and want to escape living, they run full blast with their heads into solid objects.
2283598	2283958	That's it.
2284379	2289402	That's the theme of every single one of them is ram your head into an object if you want to no longer exist.
2290403	2290963	Or you know.
2291864	2294025	If you're ready for reincarnation, run into the wall.
2296027	2301451	But anyway, yeah, and everything bad has to, something really bad has to happen every episode.
2302471	2304433	And then, but wait, there's a twist.
2305613	2306194	That's how they go.
2306234	2306834	That's how they all go.
2307295	2307675	I digress.
2309676	2310817	I mean, that's what happens on this show.
2311097	2317183	Looking at chat, Dr. Tia talking about Bellatro says, I'm probably not great at poker, and I did try it after it showed up on Game Pass.
2317464	2319065	Might have to give it another try, but it's neat.
2319125	2320687	And Bobby says, exactly.
2321387	2323369	Bobby says, the only thing it shares with poker is what the hands are.
2323469	2328654	I would say, if you've ever played Yahtzee, or Yacht, I guess, as it's called in some collections,
2329795	2342980	it that has about as much in common with poker as well like it's just it's like the scoring mechanisms and how you get things but like Yahtzee is like a very different game that just is scored similarly to poker if that makes sense
2343581	2349102	Yeah, they basically, outside the terminology and some of the gameplay, it's completely different.
2349242	2350642	Yeah.
2351523	2351963	Let's see.
2352803	2361144	Bobby Blackwolf also says about these GDC awards, these are your real awards, but nobody cares because they show no game trailers.
2361264	2362005	No, you're right.
2362065	2363485	There's no lies detected.
2363805	2366125	But here's the problem with the cycle of that.
2366605	2369106	Because they don't do game awards and because they aren't...
2369926	2371066	Thank you for watching!
2393015	2393375	DarkSakura.com
2413214	2413514	Anyway.
2414395	2414696	All right.
2415737	2421382	We just have to remember in the future, GDC week is when that happens.
2421502	2421783	Okay.
2422584	2427048	I know this isn't on the show roll for tonight, but surely...
2428328	2428708	Oh, yeah, I saw that.
2428728	2428848	Yeah.
2456623	2458364	It looks so fun!
2458965	2460286	It looks so cute!
2460486	2461366	Isn't this the best?
2462387	2462547	No.
2463027	2463648	I love this.
2463968	2465349	Just, no, wait.
2465469	2471573	I'm gonna tell you right now, like, the cat that we have come over all the time, that is how she wants to be pet.
2471593	2473915	She just gets butt up in the air.
2475376	2475696	It's like...
2476676	2478858	It's so weird, but that is so accurate.
2478958	2479198	Yes.
2479278	2482781	See, I don't need to put money into that because I have a cat.
2483181	2485163	And I smack her butt all the time.
2485323	2486764	I still would play that game.
2487064	2487645	I don't care.
2488225	2491668	SSJ100Matt says, I want someone to beat a Souls game with that controller.
2491808	2492289	Oh, I'm sure.
2492349	2493330	GDQ next year?
2493510	2494090	Absolutely.
2494290	2494791	Absolutely.
2495812	2500575	What about installing Doom on that TV and playing Doom with the cat butt?
2500615	2501696	Like, it's going to happen.
2502197	2505179	Just give the internet a little time, people.
2505439	2505900	A little time.
2505940	2506260	It's been...
2506400	2509421	We just need to see when this gets to round one.
2510021	2510461	Yeah, right.
2510761	2512902	So anyway, that was... I still haven't been to that round one, by the way.
2513442	2513782	Really?
2514723	2515123	Yeah, really.
2515223	2520565	We need to like really do a night out because we talked about a night out at the movies and didn't end up doing it, but it was... And then I was sick.
2520885	2523345	Yeah, it was a long week for me at work.
2523405	2527107	So yeah, no, we need to do a trip to round one.
2527847	2530768	My weekend should be more free next weekend, so maybe we can do that.
2530868	2531088	Mm-hmm.
2532214	2555831	I still want to see that movie too but the movie might be harder to find uh because uh you know because Warner Brothers I heard they did extend it another week though so it's did you hear about Wiley or Acme yes I did that's actually great it's the same distributor that did this movie right isn't that great that they get to write it off for taxes and sell it yeah that's
2556451	2556891	Great.
2556971	2559112	This same distribution company, what is it called?
2559152	2560212	Painters or something?
2560512	2560992	Is that their name?
2561132	2561552	Ketchup.
2561913	2562513	Oh, no, Ketchup.
2562533	2562793	Sorry.
2563053	2564213	Where the fuck did I get Painters from?
2564253	2565113	Okay.
2565254	2573236	Ketchup apparently offered 50 million for Coyote vs. Acme to do a full theatrical release and all that stuff with it.
2573316	2575596	And everybody on the internet is like, yes, bitch.
2576217	2576737	So we'll see.
2577759	2578199	Could happen.
2578459	2581481	Yeah, and PodCulture says, now I want Batgirl, damn it.
2581641	2582421	I'm really surprised.
2582801	2587844	Do you know how much money Netflix spent on that fucking bomb they just released?
2587864	2588884	I don't even remember the name of it.
2588945	2591546	It has the Stranger Things girl in it, who's a woman now.
2591586	2592906	She's like 21.
2593427	2594507	It's $320 million.
2594867	2595788	It's the electric state.
2595948	2596448	I have the book.
2596468	2596928	That's it.
2597008	2597369	That's it.
2597389	2597869	I just got the book.
2597889	2598229	Was it good?
2598249	2598929	Did you watch the movie?
2598969	2599370	Was it good?
2599410	2599790	I heard it wasn't.
2599810	2600610	I did watch the movie.
2600870	2601931	So here's the thing.
2602231	2603372	The movie is...
2604452	2605652	I like the environment.
2605812	2607093	I like everything about it.
2607653	2616595	I haven't read the book yet, so I don't know how accurate to the book it is, but it just seemed like the writing was bad, is what it was.
2616975	2619695	Everything else was fine with it, it's just the writing was bad.
2621156	2627437	And based off of what I heard with the Russo brothers and stuff, it's basically like, oh yeah, we like the imagery in the book.
2628211	2629011	Okay, cool.
2629271	2630252	Did you read the book?
2631972	2633513	Did you incorporate the themes of the book?
2633533	2634593	Did you read a comic book?
2634633	2635314	Who reads?
2635934	2637134	I can't read without pictures.
2637194	2640456	It's not even that big of a... We had Lea Michele analyze it for us.
2641596	2643837	But anyways, yeah, so that it's
2645140	2645720	It's alright.
2646340	2647481	I mean, I liked it.
2647761	2648381	It was alright.
2648981	2651722	Is it like an exciting movie that I'd have to go back and watch again?
2651882	2652082	No.
2652742	2653742	Like, absolutely not.
2654262	2662645	I would say if you like the idea of what they're doing with that and want to execute it better, I hear Tales from the Loop is better.
2662845	2664705	It's another book that's by the same author.
2665505	2667246	And that's an Amazon series.
2667486	2675147	The point I really wanted to make is that for that amount of money, Netflix could have made 10 movies for $32 million, which is a pretty modest, you know, pretty decent budget for a movie.
2675167	2676648	Could have made 10 movies for $32 million.
2676668	2684389	This would have been a great, if they just like had better writing and just extended it out for a series, this would have made a really good series.
2684429	2690330	Because there's a lot that they could do with the environment and the imagery that's in that, that they kind of rushed through.
2690430	2692971	And a lot of it was kind of explained away, just like,
2694386	2723449	barely it's just exposition dump and then it's just you know a thing happens and then we go do the thing and now we gotta go to this place and do this thing and there's no stakes really like they have these other like evil robots and it's like okay here are the evil robots and they're gone like it was just as quickly as they were introduced they were a threat for like 30 seconds and then then they're gone
2724775	2725295	Interesting.
2725575	2725895	All done.
2726876	2727136	All right.
2727156	2731938	Well, not only can Loki talk about movies, but there's another topic you'd love to talk about, Loki.
2732858	2733279	I do.
2733439	2733679	I do.
2733719	2734159	Get to it.
2734179	2735159	Talk about Minecraft.
2735740	2735900	Yeah.
2735940	2737680	So yesterday was Minecraft Live.
2737720	2741042	They've now committed to doing two per year.
2741162	2752967	So whereas it used to be like one big event that they would talk about, you know, the next big updates coming now that they've switched to a smaller like quarterly drop event.
2754165	2755366	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2783621	2785623	New Grass Options Dead Bushes
2801058	2826435	WindGusty Sounds, so it's a lot of ambient detailed stuff that's coming with this next update which will be out on Tuesday and then they talked about showing off the first feature of the update coming out after that which is now this new version of the gas which is like this big balloon ghost thing that has a weird baby cry to it
2827215	2853859	um but now it's called the dry gassed and you find them in the soul sand valleys and basically you hydrate them with water and then they become a friendly gas that you could ride and put cool steampunk goggles on and just ride this giant like airship thing it's kind of like the movie trailer but not like in the sense those are more set up like hot air balloons these are just like sitting on a giant balloon and just riding on the top of it um
2855000	2862869	They did show off a little bit more of the Minecraft movie, another clip of it, which is just more of Steve yelling out game mechanics for Minecraft.
2864990	2877961	I feel like, you know, like the modern day, you know, landscape of video entertainment on television and movies, it seems to be that what is hampering a lot of this stuff is bad writing.
2878321	2887709	And unfortunately with the Minecraft movie, I feel that's also going to be a thing because it's just, it's, it, it's explaining too much.
2887809	2891673	Like you don't need to explain like, those are the villagers.
2891753	2891893	Like,
2894164	2896626	We can gather that from the game or something.
2896846	2900148	But how else are they going to know what toys to look for on the store shelves?
2900168	2901348	Yeah, but they don't need to.
2901949	2902929	Who's this movie for then?
2903230	2906031	The toy companies, that's who the movie's for.
2906171	2911835	That's never heard of Minecraft, then I don't think that you need to explain all the mechanics.
2912315	2913216	It's for people that...
2913956	2919359	Play Minecraft or like enjoy it like for kids that obviously are familiar with all this stuff.
2919399	2927823	Like you don't have to explain, you know, Loki, Loki, Mel Brooks said it best merchandising, merchandising, merchandising.
2928083	2929364	I understand that.
2929504	2935607	And yes, they've already done the merchandising with the horrible Jack Black mini fig that you can get for the movie.
2937293	2940755	I saw some of the action figures, or inaction figures I should say
2952867	2968819	yeah they're scary looking but yeah so that's some of the stuff that's going to be coming we'll probably get some more updates with the Minecraft monthlies that they do and then of course that stuff will start dropping in snapshots here probably pretty soon as soon as this next update comes out
2969881	2996760	so I'm excited for it, I think it looks cool the rumors I've heard about the next update are like they were talking about doing some tweaks with horses as well like giving them horseshoes and stuff so it sounds like it could be maybe centered around transportation being that this is a new method of transportation with this flying friendly gas thing so it'll be interesting to see what happens but I'm excited and I'm excited to see the movie even though it's probably not going to be great
2998559	2998939	All right.
2998979	3001601	Well, I look forward to your review on if I should bother or not.
3002161	3002462	All right.
3002942	3003883	Well, let's move on.
3004183	3006985	And this is some of the most shocking news of the week.
3007045	3010967	But, you know, I have to talk about when companies do things right and when companies do things wrong.
3011588	3018412	I'm going to talk about a story tonight where the ESA, yes, the Entertainment Software Association, has done something useful.
3019253	3020814	This is incredible.
3021494	3021675	Huh?
3022435	3024877	Accessible Games Initiative Accessible Games Initiative
3042112	3051698	and Nintendo is going to be one of the founding members along with EA, Microsoft, Google and Ubisoft which honestly reads like a rogues gallery but here we are.
3052039	3054160	Bizarro world is here everybody.
3055581	3061605	But yeah, the Accessible Games Initiative is going to start with those five founding members but I do believe there's more as well.
3061625	3064127	I think I heard somewhere Sony is going to be involved with that and some other companies too.
3064147	3066308	That already sounds exciting.
3066328	3066408	Yeah.
3066428	3072331	Yeah, the idea is clear information about accessibility features within the video games.
3072771	3076093	There's going to be tags that will have clear criteria.
3076473	3086359	So some tags will highlight games that have clear text, large subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion, save any time, and things like that.
3086419	3090221	So Nintendo of America is going to introduce these tags in the future.
3090581	3097804	So when publishers add support for the accessible games initiative tags, you can find them in the My Nintendo Store, right?
3097844	3102686	Because we're kind of doing more of our shopping for games online by these tags.
3102986	3106227	So these tags are going to help you find what games are accessible.
3106487	3107427	Pretty logical, right?
3108108	3108468	Mm-hmm.
3109188	3117471	They are saying that this is going to help consumers, going to help the players to find information about these video games before you plunk down the $70 or whatever they cost to buy them as well.
3117931	3123213	Other games that are committed to this, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Squeenix, Warner Brothers.
3123733	3135157	Again, reads like the Rogues Gallery of Evil, but this is a great thing and a broken clock is right twice a day, so let's call out the time because it's looking good.
3136377	3151047	In a comment, the current president and CEO of the ESA, Stanley Pierre-Louis, said it was an industry-wide pursuit, saying, quote, Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that come with playing video games.
3151367	3155630	We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders.
3156111	3163996	This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play.
3164656	3165197	And yeah.
3165877	3167718	Gotta fucking hand it to them.
3167839	3169119	Games are for everyone.
3169540	3176324	This is the perfect fucking time to announce this when a lot of the developers are kind of paying attention right now.
3176705	3177425	So you know what?
3177765	3179086	Here you go, ESA.
3179627	3182749	I'm going to award you one clap.
3182949	3183349	Here you go.
3183850	3185391	One clap from Rob Roberts.
3186598	3187038	Thank you.
3187238	3187878	Thank you very much.
3187938	3190319	No, this really is a good thing.
3190899	3193660	More of this energy, please.
3194140	3201442	Now do Game Workers Rights next, but you won't because you represent the publishers, which are usually the ones.
3201842	3203762	But I'm going to challenge.
3204343	3205943	Do Working Conditions next.
3208104	3208644	SSJ100Map.
3211540	3218189	200 Matt in chat says, ESA doing the right thing is like the Washington Generals beating the Harlem Grobetrotters once every 50 years.
3219671	3221333	Yes, that part.
3221673	3224897	Well, also, I think, you know, and maybe this is it too.
3226219	3228182	I need to look into this before I run my mouth.
3231966	3236309	Somebody buy me time, because I need to, before I run my mouth here.
3236509	3240252	And here's Rob looking up stuff, but we like a fact check here in this house, right?
3240292	3240772	That's right.
3241452	3242033	We sure do.
3242773	3253600	And like, some people in charge of things in this universe, gonna say, but... I was told there'd be no fact checking.
3255201	3256002	You were lied to.
3256542	3257083	Lies!
3259825	3260926	Many, many lives.
3261046	3265968	I'm trying to figure out, okay, my thought is, how long has the CEO been there?
3267309	3270471	Isn't he newer to the organization?
3270931	3271691	No, since 2019.
3273312	3273993	Okay, hmm.
3274953	3276494	He's there since about four times.
3276574	3276934	All right.
3279055	3279556	I don't know then.
3279636	3281297	All right, I thought they had recently replaced.
3281537	3282857	See, that's why I fact-checked live.
3282917	3283418	Never mind then.
3283878	3284058	Yep.
3285168	3285428	All right.
3286249	3287709	Well, let's move on then.
3287729	3288810	We appreciate the fact-checking.
3288830	3289330	That's right.
3289370	3291191	So, see, I didn't run my mouth for once.
3291271	3291571	All right.
3292292	3297314	DarkSakura, why don't you give us the facts on what one of our favorite game devs of the past is up to?
3298635	3301096	Well, we like ourselves a Katamari.
3301317	3303918	We've left our mark on a Katamari in real life.
3304198	3305799	Well, we left a very tiny CD on it.
3305839	3308540	We left our mark on their Wikipedia article for one of their games.
3308580	3309101	Yes, we did.
3309621	3310201	We did.
3310241	3310761	It hurts.
3311142	3313343	It hurts also on there, too.
3314582	3337743	but Takahashi Keita who we love for Katamari and also for Nobi Nobi Boy and a few other interesting things has told us why he left Bandai Namco in 2010 because he wanted to share experiences with different developers to go all over the world and get different ideas from other people
3340926	3343428	He likes to see what different customs are around the world.
3343448	3344348	I'll go ahead and read a quote.
3345089	3348451	American schools don't have the custom of changing shoes like Japanese schools do.
3348952	3352994	I was once asked by a team member about what the school space full of shoe cupboards was like.
3353095	3359919	I tried to convey to them that there are loads of shoes and that there's a kind of smell, but it really is something that's unique to Japan.
3361921	3379451	I don't know what school culture is like in the US so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements so basically he wants to explore all different cultures and be able to incorporate the things that he learns into different games he wants to be able to understand his target audience and we don't have enough people doing that I love it
3381940	3388023	Yeah, some, you know, I feel like the news about this gentleman comes around like once every few years.
3388684	3398149	But that's kind of, yeah, I think it's, I think a change in atmosphere once in a while is a really good thing, especially in artistic sort of industries.
3398189	3398610	You know what I mean?
3399470	3400491	No, it absolutely is.
3400611	3404193	I mean, we, like I was just saying, we need more of that happening.
3404213	3404593	Mm-hmm.
3405959	3427573	you know it's we get too many I think games out there where it's just sort of not necessarily that it's a true cookie cutter but that it falls into a very targeted trap uh you know trap that you're only you know you're gonna get money out of these people so make it for these people right yeah um
3429227	3454590	I don't know I just I have feelings about it but I think that that I mean well I mean it's true we really do need more people willing to put that kind of legwork into it who want to understand the gamers who want to understand that there are bigger stories to be told well I look forward to playing to a tee very soon
3456856	3457617	I'll definitely check it out.
3458838	3460240	Here's a game I won't be checking out.
3461381	3464104	That's going to be May 28th, by the way.
3464204	3467407	Moving into a game I won't be checking out, but no shade.
3467507	3470911	It's just not my preferred thing, but Loki?
3472217	3484727	Yeah, so EA College Football apparently is offering more money to college players to appear in the game.
3485227	3489030	So I was just shocked at the amount of money that they get.
3489750	3498137	So previously, they would get $600 and a free copy of the game to appear in the
3498757	3499797	The NCA game.
3499957	3503999	A game that, you know, essentially is about them in the first place.
3504919	3506939	Now, though, they're being super generous.
3507600	3512321	Mind you, this is a multi-billion dollar company and this game makes billions of dollars each year.
3513281	3517883	They are upping that from $600 to $1,500 now if they will license their likeness to EA.
3517923	3517963	Um...
3525942	3538916	I hope it's just for the one year, because I could see them using AI to do stuff with these players and stuff, but that seems awfully low for putting these players in the game.
3538976	3541279	Y'all better write that AI shit in the contract.
3541579	3545423	I'm telling you, if we have any college football players that listen to this show...
3547193	3552796	If we have any, you better write that anti-AI shit into your contracts.
3552896	3557298	Do not sign if they have the right to use AI in your likeness for anything.
3558138	3559179	Unless you really want it.
3559199	3561620	It's just awfully low, considering that, like, what, $600?
3561660	3562560	Well, that's...
3564825	3565686	So, you know, it's not...
3590369	3594253	It is a little different than maybe when there's only like 21 players on a team and 21 teams.
3594273	3599757	You know, it's a lot more people play college football than you might think off the top of your head.
3599797	3602580	So like, I do understand that.
3602600	3604862	College football is religion in the South.
3605262	3606103	Yeah, it is.
3606923	3612028	I think, you know, if it's just, you know, like their stat and maybe like their likeness in the game, I...
3614060	3614420	I don't know.
3614641	3623907	It's hard for me to say what is fair and what is not fair, but if you are one of these people and you don't feel you're being compensated appropriately, you have the right to ask for more.
3624027	3629090	You might get told no, and it might be some hard bargaining, but you don't know if you don't ask.
3629310	3640918	And I would suppose it would depend on, you know, I don't know who the celebrities are in that sort of realm, but maybe there's some people that might feel entitled to a little more money, but then I don't know how it gets all...
3641638	3646209	Fuck you with union agreements at the collegiate level and all that stuff.
3646430	3648254	Yeah.
3648615	3648815	Yeah.
3649658	3650159	So, I mean, I...
3652600	3654021	It is, it is double.
3654221	3655681	It is, I mean, it is going up.
3655821	3672267	It does sound, I think it, I think it sounds bad because you think about your big football players and why in my brain do when I say big football players, I go like Joe Montana, like my brain, my brain is still rooting for the 49ers in 1985.
3672387	3673848	That is like where my brain goes.
3674228	3676249	Big football players like Joe Montana.
3676929	3679090	It's like, you know, that's,
3680091	3682801	Who would be commanding a lot more money.
3683383	3684748	But for these college players...
3685743	3703639	I mean, it's... I would say to my point, though, if it's too expensive to make your game because you have to pay people fairly, and you're like, well, I just can't do this if I can't pay them unfairly, then you can't make your game!
3704159	3704619	Sorry!
3705220	3706781	You can't do it then.
3707362	3708623	I don't know.
3708843	3713027	It just seems ridiculous to... That is such little money...
3714295	3717937	Well, you know, at the end, Bobby does point out players do opt out.
3718037	3718677	You can opt out.
3718777	3719698	You're not bound to this.
3719918	3722860	And like I said, if you don't think it's enough money, you have the right to opt out, which is good.
3723600	3724140	So don't sign it.
3724580	3725241	I think it's good.
3725281	3740229	But like, yeah, I mean, honestly, it just seems considering the amount of money that people make or demand for different things and considering how much money this company rakes in with Madden and
3741349	3743332	and E-Ink.
3743852	3748258	I want to say, isn't Ultimate Team part of the college one as well?
3749400	3754761	There's a lot of money, and there's absolutely no reason they couldn't pay more.
3754841	3755781	How would you feel?
3756661	3759002	Okay, just hypothetically.
3759722	3765563	How would you feel about a deal where if instead of a flat figure, there was a likeness pool?
3766123	3776646	We're going to pool all the players together into one financial pool that is like, we'll say 3% of the profits of the game go into this financial pool that will pay all of the players equally for their likenesses.
3777346	3778506	Yes, I think that's fine.
3779929	3780309	Interesting.
3781170	3781410	Okay.
3782450	3789614	I'd be curious how the math is mathing when all is said and done because Bobby does provide some good figures here saying that it was basically $8.5 million at $600 a pop.
3789634	3791975	You know, this is going to be much more money.
3792095	3803060	So, you know, if they are spending a pretty good percentage of the actual profits on this, then it probably just – it really – it's like those fucking class action lawsuits you get the emails about.
3803120	3805621	And then you're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get a big old fucking check.
3805641	3806842	And then you get the check in the mail.
3806862	3807122	And you get –
3807522	3836324	it's $4.06 and it's like because so many people did it it got split between all those people so I feel like there's similar mathiness going on here where it's just there's a lot of people entitled to the money let's see so college football 25 um so let's see here um
3837489	3843175	It says they only opted in, there's only 10,000 athletes Only 10,000?
3845438	3858932	Well, they had opted in for, yeah, so it was like 6 million, I guess, would that be, I think that's 6 million with $600 each But the game, let's see, so the game itself, I'm trying to see what the sales numbers were on this real quick
3860051	3865075	I guess, yeah, you add up 105 players on 10,000 players.
3865876	3871280	That's, again, it's a lot of people to split the money between.
3871440	3872180	That's what's happening.
3875242	3875503	Anyway.
3875663	3876824	I mean, I get it.
3877064	3883789	I just think, you know, at launch it says more than 2.8 million players.
3884669	3888352	It says 2.2 million whom purchased the deluxe edition of the game.
3890379	3906105	so 2.8 million uh 70 dollars a game i mean that's like but then shave the 30 off that the retail gets unless it was sold direct i mean math gets hard right no like most but yeah okay
3906585	3932545	but retail is hardly a dent in any of this stuff it's mostly digital nowadays so that 30% they're just taking the 30% so I think that kind of washes probably more so on the publisher side they probably get a lot more of that 30% because it's not the Wild West days where it's small independent stores now they're selling your games and you have to work in that margin for them
3933786	3936170	There's not a lot being sold at retail anymore.
3936290	3937511	It's mostly...
3938700	3963418	you know I think and this is probably that the reality is at the end of the day this is not a conversation that's our business and we just have to accept that in gaming we want everything to be our business but it's not always but it's all about me I know it's the games that I want just the early access the special edition versions of the game 2.2 million sold at $100 each oof
3965579	3976455	So that's $220 million Here's the rest of my thought And they're spending $6 million on the players?
3978395	3985880	The players and their agents should have an understanding of the math that we are trying to figure out live on the spot.
3986241	3990384	The players and their agents should have an understanding of what percentage does this boil down to.
3990744	3994727	And maybe that's why it went up from 600 to 1500 was through those conversations.
3995027	4002673	But I think at the end of the day, that's one of those... This is a conversation we're just not invited to the table for as much as we want gaming to center around us.
4002753	4003554	And that's what it is.
4003594	4007017	And that's before you even consider Ultimate Team because Ultimate Team is...
4007737	4015965	A major part of the pack-in bonuses with the Deluxe Edition, which sold 2.2 million copies.
4019750	4023072	Yeah, they can afford to pay them at least 10 times what they're paying them now.
4023573	4024573	They could afford that.
4024934	4025254	Easy.
4025574	4030478	We could talk much more about this, but the reality is we're not at the negotiating table.
4031018	4035941	But don't be afraid to negotiate, agents, folks, if you don't sign it.
4035981	4037743	If you don't like it, don't put a ring on it.
4038323	4039604	All right, let's move on.
4040525	4041426	Let's talk about this.
4041587	4042748	Oh, this is interesting.
4042788	4044389	Another sequel coming out of Atari.
4044710	4050796	So you know how they did like a Yars Revenge sort of reimagining and it really had very little to do with Yars Revenge.
4050856	4054900	They kind of turned it into a Metroidvania type of game that had Yars Revenge elements in it.
4055321	4055921	And to be fair...
4056682	4059523	I never got around to playing it, so I can't tell you if it's good or bad.
4059963	4067846	But apparently it was good enough for Atari and Mighty Yell and 13AM Games to come together to make Missile Command Delta.
4068566	4074408	It is now a turn-based tactical game that will be out on PS5, Switch, and PC.
4074808	4080790	Very little of the game could I get a sense of from the announcement trailer because it looked like a bunch of 3D stuff.
4080930	4082290	I was like, are they turning it into a 3D game?
4082570	4084751	But then you can see, just barely...
4085291	4090336	Some screenshots in the game I'm trying to see if I can like If you squint really hard?
4090517	4107414	Yeah, basically Like you can see Well, alright, I'm gonna do this For those that are watching live I will run the trailer here And I'll try to get the parts that actually show what the game looks like here
4110454	4112095	Which I think right in here.
4112875	4113316	Oh, dang it.
4113376	4114496	That part here.
4114596	4114956	There we go.
4115056	4119939	This part looks like the more tactical part where you have like the big board with the hexagons.
4120039	4120379	Dang it.
4120399	4125561	See, they show they show so little of it in the trailer that it's hard to get a sense of the actual game is.
4125981	4129103	But I think you see I think you see a glimpse of it here, too.
4130764	4135846	So, yeah, it's like a more like tactical, puzzly type of game here.
4137588	4138528	I don't know, it could be interesting.
4138708	4139749	Yeah.
4141209	4147931	Look, I appreciate that it's not just another fucking reboot of the same game we've been playing for literally 40 plus years.
4148291	4149651	Like, they're trying something different with it.
4149891	4150671	I hope it works out.
4151211	4154512	So, Tigerclaw says, I wonder if Mr. Awesome will play it.
4154572	4155232	Probably not.
4155593	4160534	I... I'm exhausted just thinking about that conversation.
4162492	4164234	All right, moving on.
4164314	4168557	Let's go back to a simpler time with this next segment.
4168597	4169938	We're going to roll the bumper right now.
4180467	4187773	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4188254	4190736	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4192308	4201392	This is quite the classic tonight that DarkSakura has picked for us because I know some people that would say this is the best video game ever made.
4201792	4204853	I know more than one person that would say this is the best video game ever made.
4205793	4208915	And it's about time that I did it because it hit the point.
4209615	4212676	It literally hit that point well enough.
4214096	4216418	Tomorrow.
4216618	4222402	That point being 10 years or older is what qualifies the game as classic game of the week.
4222682	4224943	But Jamie's allowed to bend the rules whenever she wants.
4225003	4225744	It's her segment.
4225764	4232728	So if she's early by a day, and I think when you hear what this game is, you're going to say, oh yeah, we can bend the rules for this one.
4233609	4234209	It's Bloodborne.
4235790	4238332	So I've already done both of those, you guys.
4238932	4241574	And I even did Halo, Bobby, because I got paid to.
4241594	4242715	Okay.
4244594	4250099	Bloodborne, a game that came out on March 24th, 2015 in North America.
4250920	4255184	PAL regions March 25th, Japan March 26th, UK March 27th.
4256265	4263171	It is an action roleplay game that was developed by From Software, published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.
4264512	4275488	You follow a hunter through this city called Yharnam, where the inhabitants have this blood-borne disease that turned them into beasts.
4276069	4280035	You have to find the source of the plague and unravel the mysteries behind it.
4281116	4310013	um there you go uh it is a third person perspective you control your protagonist and you run around and you fight shit um it has a lot of similarities to Dark Souls has lots of influences by Lovecraft and Bram Stoker and uh some this part that I think is cool it includes a lot of homages to the architectural design of Romania and the Czech Republic so I think that that's cool um
4311283	4315567	It has been, as some say, among the greatest video games ever made.
4317348	4323453	Praised for its atmosphere, art direction, sound design, the themes, gameplay, you name it.
4325715	4331780	There was some criticism when it first launched, but there have been post-release updates that made it better.
4331840	4334723	There's DLC called The Old Hunters, released November 2015.
4336124	4363622	the game has sold 7.46 million copies by February 2022 and there's all kinds of other stuff out for it as well so basically you play your hunter character and you go around fighting people, bosses and interacting with items and hanging out with NPCs and doing just all kinds of stuff that FromSoftware games are pretty much known for
4365675	4372777	So you also can return to your little hub world called the Hunter's Dream by talking to lanterns or interacting with them.
4373877	4380159	And it fills up your health, but it respawns every enemy you just fought except for bosses and mini-bosses.
4382699	4389101	But it's also got pretty big maps and all kinds of little hidden stuff that you can find.
4390822	4419022	and you also have shortcuts everywhere different places to explore but one of the other things too is that you are rewarded for higher risks so like for example if you you know you'll get health potions better health potions if you strike an enemy in like a more riskier move for example you also have a new game plus which is also good
4419502	4439160	you get Molotov cocktails, you can blow shit up you also get Blood Echoes where it works as experience points in currency and if you die you lose what you have but it drops where you left off hidden items, that kind of things it has a multiplayer mode
4441122	4467056	it is you basically activate this item and suspend an insight point and you can summon other players into your world to play with you but it does leave you open to invasions so other players can go into your your world and kill you so there's that there are chalice dungeons which are special dungeons that become available through using different items and materials um
4467996	4472397	There's really a lot going on with this game, way too much for me to go into super detail about.
4474397	4489821	But basically, Japan Studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment, reached out to From Software to work together on a game, and Miyazaki Hidetaka...
4491681	4496884	who was the director, asked about doing something for the 8th generation consoles.
4497084	4499585	And so Bloodborne came up around there.
4500886	4507930	It was something disconnected from the Dark Souls franchise, but of course it's from software.
4508030	4509551	It was going to be similar.
4510071	4517752	But they were predominantly inspired by Dracula, which features many locations in Romania and Chechnya.
4519173	4522773	Of course, there was nods to the Cthulhu mythos.
4523334	4526134	You know, all kinds of goodies in there if you're a fan.
4527694	4530195	So moving on to the release information.
4531995	4532535	It was...
4536206	4537627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4561205	4567912	Um, and, you know, I gave the release dates already, but there was the DLC, The Old Hunters, that came out November 24th, 2015.
4568512	4573377	And it's a place in a world where hunters of the past are trapped.
4573957	4576239	So you get new stuff, new outfits and stuff.
4577340	4580463	Um, there was a limited edition collector's pack.
4580563	4585288	It had a steelbook case, a hardcover art book, a digital copy of the cell track.
4586486	4597798	The Sail Trek was released separately on April 21st, 2015, and the European exclusive had physical items like a quill and ink set, and all of the items in the standard collector's edition.
4598459	4604905	The Asian edition had a letter opener that was modeled off the in-game weapon, the Kirkhammer PS4 bundle.
4605626	4607448	I was also available.
4607969	4616759	And then there was a song that was recorded by a hit house featuring Ruby Friedman for a trailer in the TV spot.
4616859	4621123	And they went all out basically for this.
4621183	4625889	In fact, Sony Denmark teamed up with Give Blood to encourage blood donations.
4627891	4634836	and anyone who donated on March 23, 2015 got a chance to win the game as a gift.
4636237	4642622	And then there was a licensed card game that was based off of the in-game Chalice Dungeons.
4643763	4644523	It came out November 2016.
4644583	4646945	There was a comic tie-in.
4646985	4648106	All kinds of stuff happened.
4648646	4652289	And it was received very, very well.
4652449	4653550	Its Metacritic score is 92%.
4655611	4656571	Edge gave it 10 out of 10.
4657032	4658652	EGM, 9.5 out of 10.
4658932	4659832	Game Informer, 9 out of 10.
4660073	4662993	So yeah, it did really, really, really well.
4664874	4669915	It also, for 2015, it won Best Original Game for Golden Joystick.
4669955	4671916	It was nominated, though, for a lot of other stuff.
4672016	4673717	And it did get PlayStation Game of the Year.
4675517	4682679	It also won the 12th British Academy Games Award for Game Design.
4683600	4684060	And there you go.
4684520	4684840	Bloodborne.
4686257	4687637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4702082	4705324	People, when it comes to games, feel completely differently as well.
4705344	4707366	They like that it is so difficult.
4707406	4708486	They like the challenge.
4708546	4716492	They like very little to guide you with the game and the sense of exploration and discovery that that gives.
4716872	4720034	And it's sometimes funny to see the most extreme way you could die.
4720314	4721335	Yeah.
4721395	4724377	But I recognize why this game is as loved as it is.
4724777	4727239	It's certainly beautiful to look at, especially for its time.
4728640	4728840	Yeah.
4729400	4730781	I think you kind of said it all otherwise.
4730881	4731842	For its time, Rob.
4733543	4759026	I mean it's not that old I know but just there's still tons of stuff on PS4 that look pretty modern Questmaster in chat says word is that the reason there hasn't been a remake which many fans have been clamoring and modding for years is that Hidetaka is too busy to do it himself and won't let it go to anyone else I believe that
4760968	4762969	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Bloodborne.
4764710	4766171	And for those of you that were asking, when?
4766331	4767032	Bloodborne, when?
4767092	4767572	Well, there you go.
4767592	4768072	There's your answer.
4768112	4768893	Now that it's 10 years old.
4770234	4776637	All right, let's move on and check out some other headlines from the week rapidly in some rapid-fire news.
4776757	4777018	Loki.
4778699	4780239	I don't know what this is at all.
4782165	4783486	I don't know why you would do this.
4783846	4791469	I mean, I assume they want to make money off the meme, but Big Rigs Over the Road Racing is now coming to Steam.
4791969	4807294	And if you don't know what Big Rigs Over the Road Racing is, it is an absolute terrible game about racing big rigs that it was completely unfinished and released retail, has no collision effect, you know, no very minimal physics.
4807455	4808515	Everything is just broken.
4809195	4831733	and there's no real word on if any of that stuff's gonna be fixed or if it's just gonna be a port of the game now running on Steam so I guess we'll find out yay um congrats to all the fans that are gonna buy this game they get a lot cited gold star that says your did it
4832899	4833019	S.J.
4833039	4834381	and Hunter Mattis probably on the right track.
4834401	4838306	The rights were probably cheap and might try to cash in on the terribleness.
4838667	4838306	100%.
4839909	4843373	100%.
4839949	4843373	Look, Showgirls gets re-released on Blu-ray every other year for a reason.
4844735	4844875	Yeah.
4845749	4849792	Um, and then, uh, this is kind of funny, but it's the times we live in.
4849932	4856877	You know, everybody remembers those old scholastic book fairs, you know, where you get all the different books and stuff.
4856897	4858798	They don't, like, cordon off a classroom.
4858818	4860839	That was, like, the highlight of the year.
4861680	4864762	Yeah, they always have, like, weird, like, video game things in there.
4864862	4867104	Usually they used to be, like, cheat guides and stuff like that.
4867164	4869725	Gotta get those tickets to Great America by selling a million books.
4870366	4874529	Well, now is the time to capitalize on the popular...
4875808	4878451	Internet Culture, and put it into a book.
4879031	4887058	And none other than Scholastic themselves has announced that they plan to print books and graphic novels based on Skibbity Toilet.
4888019	4888900	That's right.
4889000	4890982	Your favorite... How the mighty have fallen.
4891823	4899350	Your favorite Garry's Mod imagery coming to a Scholastic Golden Book soon.
4901397	4901918	Oh boy.
4902138	4903521	I'm going to go cry in the corner.
4903581	4907127	You know, Whitney Houston once said, I believe that children are the future.
4907568	4910413	And then she passed away.
4910453	4912216	And now clearly nobody believes that anymore.
4913055	4914096	and Converse Classic.
4914116	4919539	We're beyond thrilled to be the publishing partner for one of the most groundbreaking and unique properties of our time.
4919559	4921300	Okay, it's not groundbreaking.
4921360	4921700	Come on.
4921720	4924402	Brain-breaking, but not groundbreaking.
4924502	4925983	Let's reel it in.
4926203	4927424	It's not groundbreaking.
4927564	4928204	It's just weird.
4929185	4932907	A truly cultural phenomenon that resonates with readers of all ages.
4934308	4936989	I beg to disagree there, but okay.
4937170	4938650	Let's just... We'll see.
4938671	4941052	You don't want to know what my brain heard, by the way.
4944893	4948997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4962549	4965732	Yeah, well, I mean, definitely has potential to be, wouldn't you think?
4967954	4976702	But there is a sequel to Super Dodgeball, Double Dragon Dodgeball by Arc Systems.
4977930	4983834	So it has 56 characters from Double Dragon who will play dodgeball against each other.
4984034	4992279	And it will be released for PS5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC via Steam on October 23rd.
4992359	4993339	And it looks fun.
4993820	4998322	You have a story mode, which is like the classic Marion Rescue story.
4998402	5001444	I think by now she would just start packing heat with her.
5003245	5005046	Two player versus mode and a survival mode.
5007328	5007688	There you go.
5008211	5008691	Sounds fun.
5010272	5011132	I'd check that out for sure.
5012233	5017735	Music game fans, I know you're out there and there's a new release for you because guess who's involved with this?
5017895	5018335	Naoki.
5018835	5022777	Yes, the one and only Naoki from the early Konami days is involved with this one.
5022857	5023597	He's alive!
5023717	5026598	It's called MASH VP Revision.
5026658	5030019	It is leaving Early Access and officially launching as of yesterday.
5030039	5030980	So it's actually already out now.
5031600	5033981	Available in a variety of languages, including English.
5034301	5036322	This first went into Early Access on October 11th.
5037302	5061076	and uh this game will have 130 songs that you can mash together through the mashup system so apparently with this game you have two lines of music and you mash them together it's sounding a little dj hero-y but not really i don't really want to go down that road just kind of like oh it just kind of takes me back to those days but uh yeah i'm very curious to check this out sounds like it could be a lot of fun uh guess what there's a lot of uh
5061736	5087812	Artists you may have heard of in this game Not only Naoki, but also Akira Yamaoka Akira Yamaoka is in this, Paula Terry is on one of the tracks So yeah It can't be Naoki without Paula Terry somewhere That's right, that's right She needs to buy groceries, so we gotta get her a check So this is great I'll check this out, I'm gonna put this on my wishlist and try to grab this soon Cool
5089194	5095407	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

5174897	5176177	This is a remake of an old PC game.

5225435	5225735	That's it.
5226584	5229086	All right, traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.
5229586	5233289	Stalker, Legends of the Zone Trilogy is out this week in Japan on the Switch.
5233649	5235931	Winning post 10 at 2025.
5236031	5237332	That's a horse racing series.
5237372	5240034	I think it's winning 11 here from Koei Tecmo.
5240434	5241916	So what happens when they get to the next game?
5241996	5242636	It's going to be winning 11-11.
5243877	5244257	at some point.
5244277	5248201	Anyway, Winning Post 10 is out on the Switch this week.
5248301	5249322	Now, this is a U.S.
5249442	5255907	date, but I just want to call it out because I feel like we see these all the time in Japan, these Kemco RPG collections.
5257248	5258790	They are releasing one in the U.S.
5258970	5261252	Volume 1 comes to the U.S.
5261452	5263514	I swear to God, there's like 13 of these in Japan.
5263934	5266556	But Volume 1, finally on the Switch in the U.S.
5266716	5267157	next week.
5267977	5270720	As Divine Hearts, Revenant Saga, Antiqua Lost...
5271800	5273921	Sorry, Antiqua Lost and Dragon Sinker.
5273981	5288067	And I don't think it made our show role, but I think possibly timed for this, some classic Super Nintendo strategy games like Nobunaga's Ambition, which actually was a remake on Super Nintendo in itself because the original original was on Nintendo.
5288987	5291709	Games in that series are making their way to Switch Online.
5291969	5294230	So kind of interesting.
5294730	5294950	Anyway...
5295810	5299092	Let's see, other releases actually for Japan this week.
5299352	5305815	Setsuna ni Kakeru ko Hanabi comes out this week as well on the Switch.
5306875	5311317	And, oh, here we go, Kemco RPG Selection Volume 9.
5312138	5314259	I thought they were further along than 9, but they have 9.
5314319	5317240	So, As Divine Saga, Ghost Sinks, Sword of Elphesia...
5317740	5318620	and Ambition Record.
5318700	5319320	Oh, so interesting.
5319340	5320241	There's some crossover there.
5320381	5323301	I would have thought maybe we got games that kind of matched the first one, but no.
5323662	5325902	So Volume 9, that's what it looks like in Japan.
5326762	5331743	Sanrio Characters Miracle Match is out in Japan as well this week.
5332284	5332704	Why not?
5332804	5333244	Why not?
5333364	5334744	We needed another Hello Kitty game.
5336465	5338705	As long as there's lots of little twin stars, I'm happy.
5339085	5341586	And a game called Go Hell Go.
5342186	5344327	Not Oh Hell No, but Go Hell Go.
5344927	5345647	Suki Oto...
5346087	5348709	Yoshite Ko comes out as well.
5348929	5354332	And all I'm going to say, I'm going to, I don't even, can I even show this screenshot on our Twitch show?
5354352	5355173	I'm going to show it fast.
5355193	5356033	I'm going to show it fast.
5356233	5363298	So it's, it's safe for this website and everything's covered, but this screenshot should give you an example of what to expect in this game.
5363338	5364518	That's all I'm going to say.
5364859	5365259	Okay.
5369422	5369782	Okay.
5370382	5371083	No.
5373084	5373204	No.
5375536	5377817	I mean... And the chat goes mild.
5378697	5380538	There's a lot of silence and what?
5380978	5383758	Actually, the chat comments can be summed up as what?
5385439	5386779	How about the PlayStation 5?
5386939	5395902	Hey, maybe you prefer your exploitation a little more classic and you want Dead or Alive Extreme Venus Vacation Prism.
5395982	5398703	That is out on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.
5398743	5400523	Venus Vacation Prism.
5400603	5402224	That is the name of the game.
5402324	5402904	Did I stutter?
5406300	5413524	The graphics are really good, and the bra sizes, very big numbers, apparently.
5413984	5414265	Anyway.
5415445	5416946	You know what I keep thinking?
5417406	5417526	What?
5417546	5418547	You know what I keep thinking?
5418787	5420228	Ow?
5420548	5421268	Her poor back.

5591294	5594937	Alright, but let's get to this news story, Loki.
5595918	5605167	Yeah, so apparently there's some stuff being teased on social media coming from none other than Game Informer.
5605807	5605948	What?
5606008	5616617	Apparently it says, you know, they're going to make a, there's a video that they have called Continue, and it basically teases something being announced on the 25th.
5618820	5628543	and apparently there are staff from the previous Game Informer that have been also sharing this and it sounds like they're going to be involved.
5628703	5628983	Great.
5629523	5630704	Maybe it's coming back.
5630804	5632824	Somebody scooped up the rights at a bargain basement price.
5632864	5633225	Good for them.
5633785	5635145	I'm excited to see what happens.
5635205	5636346	Is ketchup going to be doing it?
5636626	5638066	Is ketchup going to save everything?
5638146	5638646	Jesus.
5639186	5641507	No, it's a new company called Mustard.
5642467	5642928	Mustard.
5643728	5644268	Oh, Jesus.
5646058	5646398	I tried.
5646538	5646779	Sorry.
5646799	5647139	I can't.
5647239	5647779	Sorry, everybody.
5647819	5648280	I'm going home.
5649080	5649381	All right.
5649961	5650802	We're home, Rob.
5650842	5653784	You can tell me to go home in this next segment, our Lister Roundtable.
5653804	5656906	If you'd like to give us a call, vognetwork.com slash discord.
5656926	5660429	If you guys have any random questions for us in chat, we welcome those as well.
5661029	5662690	You also can send us emails every week.
5663031	5665272	Participate at orangelauntrader.com.
5665312	5668074	But when I went in there a couple hours ago, there was nothing I saw.
5668395	5669135	It's a desert.
5669275	5669796	Oh, my God.
5669996	5672618	With space balls combing it.
5672718	5673919	There was at least 13 space balls.
5675540	5677401	Tuvok going, we ain't found shit.
5677781	5680942	There was 13 spam emails in there from one week.
5681843	5682283	One week.
5682743	5689746	And clearly the mistake I made was putting this show on YouTube because all of the spam is about increasing your YouTube views.
5690672	5691994	So that's kind of annoying.
5692234	5696999	All we need to do is go in and hit the unsubscribe on some of those.
5698161	5700724	You know why I don't like doing that?
5700884	5702786	I have an honest reason why I don't like doing that.
5702886	5705469	Because it tells them that you read it and that the email is valid.
5705889	5708332	I don't trust that that works.
5708352	5710635	But they still have to take you off.
5710855	5711376	They have to.
5713597	5714619	Consider me skeptic.
5714699	5714999	Sorry.
5715079	5715480	I mean, no.
5716461	5718024	Let me put it this way.
5718564	5720588	I understand that is the way the law is written.
5721048	5722410	Yeah.
5722430	5723652	There are also redirects.
5725074	5725235	Yeah.
5726466	5727747	Spam of the week.
5727767	5727927	Shut up.
5749990	5751692	I'm not giving that any freaking attention.
5751732	5752333	No, we are not.
5752393	5753033	No, we are not.
5753854	5758779	So... Fuck a bunch of that on a pogo stick.
5759340	5764185	Dr. T in chat says, I wanted to shout out MulletMadJack on Game Pass.
5764953	5768814	Game Pass has a lot of neat little indie and titles you might miss if you're not paying attention.
5769554	5774536	A Doom-style roguelike with a 90s anime aesthetic.
5774816	5776797	Misha and I are both hooked.
5777537	5781558	And DarkTest Studio says, I do try to send in Blue Sky stuff, but we've been super busy IRL.
5781598	5782298	Otherwise, I would have.
5782378	5783239	No, you don't have to apologize.
5783579	5787120	And to be fair, I'm very bad at – well, I do – I check Blue Sky throughout the week.
5787620	5788461	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5802995	5811437	Maybe we just need like a dedicated... Because I like the fact that there's a channel for Orange Launch Radio where people can post the news and sometimes discuss the news.
5811857	5815318	But I wish there was a place that was like just questions and feedback or something.
5815378	5815718	I don't know.
5815798	5817558	I don't know how to figure that out.
5817658	5820179	But I know Discord is a big thing these days now.
5821559	5822719	I will check that game out, Mish.
5822979	5825880	If it's on Game Pass, hey, I'm all for checking it out.
5826514	5827695	I think it's in my library.
5828036	5830878	I think Jamie got it for me for Christmas.
5831038	5832079	Oh, I love that.
5832099	5832920	When did I get you?
5833220	5834381	Mullet Mad Jack.
5834962	5835442	Oh, yeah.
5835783	5837404	When I saw that, I was like, I have to get that for you.
5838105	5840967	Yeah, so it's on there.
5841308	5844631	There's a lot of things that are in my library that I need to play.
5844651	5844691	Oh.
5845948	5852530	Okay, OrangeRite in chat says, I did tell someone making a podcast starter pack on Blue Sky about Orange Lounge Radio.
5852931	5854091	Hopefully it wasn't my fault.
5854311	5855672	No, but I did wonder.
5855952	5859173	We got like 25 new follows on Blue Sky, which is a lot for us.
5859473	5861634	And I was like, where did all these people come from?
5862634	5863935	So I was wondering about that.
5863955	5864855	Hi all of those people.
5865035	5867056	No, hi to any new listeners potentially.
5867116	5868276	No, OrangeRite, you're fine.
5868336	5868957	It's not your fault.
5869037	5874219	It's the... I can tell you right now, all the spam email we're getting is, you're not getting enough YouTube viewers.
5874639	5876260	Here's how to get more YouTube viewers.
5876300	5878100	Your podcast isn't getting enough viewers.
5878180	5880341	Let us help inflate your... It's all that shit.
5880401	5886764	And I know it's because we made the mistake of putting our email address on... Well, which is through the RSS feed.
5886804	5888504	So it's not really... It's on YouTube.
5888965	5889425	And people...
5890565	5910552	people scrape YouTube for all of that stuff for to send those sorts of emails so yeah no but thank you Orange right now that that answers that question I had I wondered why we got like a sudden influx of followers on Blue Sky I was like so somebody put us in a starter pack well that's really nice thank you we're not arguing with any of that
5912760	5914621	SHO and Hunter Matt says, need more cat photos.
5914701	5916682	Bobby drops a cat photo and gets hundreds of likes.
5916842	5917723	No, for real.
5918063	5918483	For real.
5918583	5921845	My cat photos get more traction than anything else on Blue Sky, which is fine.
5922105	5924286	Cheddar's the most adorable kitty.
5924706	5931049	As Alan puts it, the cat with permanent eyeliner.
5931289	5935691	Because he has these black lines that go from his eyes that make it look like he has permanent wings.
5936392	5936712	Makeup.
5937032	5937432	It's great.
5937932	5938493	I love Cheddar.
5939153	5940354	And there is my Midna.
5941034	5941114	Aww.
5944509	5948250	All I will say is we're considering that.
5949170	5958934	Alan is being courted by the adoption agency for a second cat that they think would be good.
5959114	5959934	So we'll see.
5959974	5961295	And I'm open to it, of course.
5961495	5962035	I love kitties.
5963195	5964776	Are they the kind that let you do the trial?
5966386	5966766	Oh, yeah.
5966866	5970609	I mean, they really want you to try to make it work like anybody would.
5970689	5975453	But yes, if for whatever reason the cats were to hate each other, they would always take them back.
5977435	5977855	That's good.
5979457	5979777	All right.
5980037	5982800	Well, Loki, let me check in with you and see if you have any last minute stories for us tonight.
5983676	5984757	I do not.
5985037	5991984	I was going to mention, though, coinciding with the Minecraft movie, they're going to be doing tie-ins with McDonald's.
5992504	6001011	So they had some really creepy Minecraft... So you know how the Minecraft movie visuals are already kind of like, uh, kind of creepy?
6001752	6004434	Now you put McDonald's characters in that style?
6006216	6006336	Ew.
6007217	6007637	I mean...
6009013	6010254	Is it the hot Hamburglar?
6010274	6010314	No.
6012635	6012935	What?
6013175	6013375	What?
6013756	6016317	Is there... Oh, you mean like from the Japanese commercials?
6016397	6023441	No, in like 2006, so that was like 20 years ago, they tried to reboot the Hamburglar for McDonald's and they made the hot Hamburglar.
6025042	6025842	I don't remember that.
6026042	6029084	I might have just forced that out of my memory.
6030404	6030865	No, let me see.
6031105	6032766	I'm getting it up right now on the other screen.
6033006	6033686	That's okay, Rob.
6034727	6036728	Well, now I want to share with the listeners.
6039017	6040658	And then Grimace could be a character.
6040698	6044440	So see, there's the... How do I get this big?
6044761	6048243	Because Grimace is the face that you make an hour after eating McDonald's.
6051685	6052465	Aptly named.
6054967	6058609	Anyway, if that's it for the stories then...
6060726	6088469	S200 Matt says Ben Star no but he did have that new commercial for Square Enix in the last week that was like I heard you might be looking for some new games to play and of course the answer is always Final Fantasy 8 but bearing that it's very his style is great anyway I picked up Final Fantasy 6 in that I didn't want to pick up all the Final Fantasy games because I was like I probably won't play them but
6088979	6090341	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6107183	6131444	Because, well, at least for a little while, my work schedule has me needing to get there at 6 in the morning And I have to be in office so I won't have my usual wake up time But I'll see how it goes after I'm back to my hybrid schedule where I can work at home on Monday And we'll see, but for right now I would not be at all able to do the thing
6132486	6135207	I can't, I can't brain, words are hard Can't even No, words are hard
6157958	6161039	Before I forget to say it, thank you, of course, for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us.
6161359	6165980	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if you want more voices to put out on air, tell a friend or two about the show.
6166020	6166760	Help us spread the word.
6167100	6178063	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or excuse me, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or I guess YouTube, even if it's going to invite spam, but show those spammers we don't need them.
6178983	6181823	That goes an awful long way, so thank you very much for all that support.
6181863	6182524	We appreciate it.
6183364	6184444	Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
6186108	6190850	My final thought is I got surprised with the mail that I get jury duty.
6191631	6192831	Yay!
6192871	6193111	Yay!
6193191	6194752	And the crowd hates it.
6194892	6195272	Alright.
6197185	6198065	She has to read a book.
6198186	6199226	Yeah, hopefully it's a short trial.
6200827	6204689	My final thought is I have a three-day weekend next weekend.
6204909	6207330	It's a very delightful surprise three-day weekend.
6207370	6210731	It's a state holiday, not a federal holiday, but I have it off, so I'm like, yay.
6211532	6212712	Hooray surprise holidays.
6212772	6213973	We love surprise holidays.
6214493	6215694	But we'll be back.
6216354	6219137	in seven days to do it all again on another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
