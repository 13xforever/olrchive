00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:45,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

2
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:09,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You're perfect.

10
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:11,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You look like a model.

11
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:13,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Linda Evangelista.

12
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:13,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

13
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:14,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

14
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:19,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't have a voice very much because I just got over a cold.

15
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,273
[SPEAKER_07]: What super spreader event did you attend?

16
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:23,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to work.

17
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:24,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

18
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:30,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, those whole back in office mandates are real useful, aren't they?

19
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:34,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had an x-ray for my leg.

20
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's broken.

21
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:35,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

22
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:36,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Two months later.

23
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:38,644
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

24
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:39,925
[SPEAKER_07]: A little whore?

25
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:40,106
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

26
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:40,226
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

27
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:03,065
[SPEAKER_07]: A little horror show.

28
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:06,187
[SPEAKER_07]: The camp classic sleepaway camp from the 80s.

29
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,469
[SPEAKER_07]: We were doing a live screening with the star.

30
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,110
[SPEAKER_07]: She was like 13 when she was in the movies.

31
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's in her 50s now because it's an old movie.

32
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it a live screening or a live screaming?

33
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:15,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all of the above.

34
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:16,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all of the above.

35
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good time.

36
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And did you wear your sunscreen?

37
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,340
[SPEAKER_07]: To an indoor at night event?

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, of course I did.

39
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, always wear your sunscreen.

40
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:25,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

41
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:27,847
[SPEAKER_04]: There's radiation everywhere, Rob.

42
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:31,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Technically, the little face wash I use is sunscreen.

43
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:33,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, yes, I wore sunscreen.

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,924
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what's funny?

45
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: This face wash is like have stuff in them.

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really do any good unless you like leave them on your face for a couple of minutes before you wash them off.

47
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I do do that in the shower.

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:45,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

49
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do that.

50
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:53,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I kind of not that you all need to know my shower routine, but I will I will soap other things that need soaping while while that is resting.

51
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,873
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your skincare PSA.

52
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:56,413
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

53
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:59,015
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how I look so fucking good approaching 50.

54
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thank you very much.

55
00:03:02,738 --> 00:03:03,078
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

56
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's happening next month.

57
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you're having a sub-a-thon because you want money.

58
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it's your birthday too.

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be 49.

60
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, but you're still not 50.

61
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:16,911
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not approaching 50.

62
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

63
00:03:20,872 --> 00:03:23,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm knock, knock, knocking on 50's doors.

64
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a whore in that race, okay?

65
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You're kicking down that door.

66
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a whore in that race.

67
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:29,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean horse.

68
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:44,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, let's say hello to another old horse here on the program Always tip and respect your sex workers But, younger than DarkSakura myself, say hello to TechMasterLoki Hello Hi Loki, how are you?

69
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:59,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed tonight as we're taping live, because let's get this plug out, we do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

70
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You can catch us live.

71
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we always get it right on the first take.

72
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:07,274
[SPEAKER_07]: We would never have microphone fails or OBS suddenly deciding to switch audio devices.

73
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:07,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

74
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can, or maybe...

75
00:04:09,636 --> 00:04:10,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember drivers.

76
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:10,756
[SPEAKER_07]: How quaint.

77
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:50,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I only drive when it's Forza Horizon Put that on a t-shirt Or if I'm Loki, this is another case I would drive Playing F-Zero GX, which I noticed you have playing behind you tonight Oh, sorry, this is AX, the arcade one Oh, shit

78
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:51,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

79
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

80
00:04:52,598 --> 00:05:11,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've reminisced on the show before, but y'all have to know that we are â€“ look, we talk about how we're old, but I want to tell you all we are privileged to have lived at the same time as A, Dolly Parton, and B, F-Zero AX in the arcades and actually getting to go to what, Sunnyvale Golf Land or who had that machine?

81
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:12,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunnyvale had it.

82
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:12,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Sunnyvale Golf Land.

83
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:23,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody else had it, maybe a place in Vegas, and actually get to play F-Zero AX, taking our fucking GameCube memory cards, putting it in the machine because you unlock... People forget this.

84
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:28,140
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one time I'm ever going to say Nintendo was ahead of its time.

85
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm not, because sometimes...

86
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:38,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they actually, it's one of those like the correct fool who ends up doing something wrong but ends up getting it right.

87
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: But Nintendo totally got it right here.

88
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:46,373
[SPEAKER_07]: You would put your GameCube memory card in the F-Zero AX machine and you could fucking unlock the tracks for the home version.

89
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why I have been saying,

90
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:51,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going blue in the face saying this too much.

91
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:56,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope to God, maybe Switch 2 has the mystical, magical hardware that will let it happen.

92
00:05:57,202 --> 00:06:00,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Re-release F-Zero GX, you cowards.

93
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:08,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And now just flip the magic switch, have a little save file by default with all the AX tracks unlocked.

94
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:12,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm telling you, like 95% of the people that played F-Zero never saw those tracks.

95
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be amazing.

96
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:25,543
[SPEAKER_07]: which were really just reroutes like they were they were just reroutes of existing tracks in the game I don't think there was anything like completely original but still you guys will yeah

97
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:30,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or as SSJ100Mac calls it, Rob going big blue in the face.

98
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:31,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

99
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:42,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And technically, I think there's either a developer code or a GameShark code that you can put in to actually unlock.

100
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an AX mode even.

101
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:46,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have like a whole...

102
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:47,798
[SPEAKER_01]: F-Zero GX

103
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:09,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all are going to hate me for suggesting this, but Nintendo could sell them both.

104
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo should sell both.

105
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:11,977
[SPEAKER_07]: They could sell them separately.

106
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:15,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Sell AX and sell GX, and then let people share the same file between them.

107
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:16,959
[SPEAKER_07]: People will buy them both.

108
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:17,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

109
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you all are going to hate me for saying it, but let's be real.

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I need Nintendo's attention.

111
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I need their attention.

112
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:28,764
[SPEAKER_01]: AX goes on the Nintendo Online Expansion Pass, and then you sell the other game, and then it unlocks tracks on the other game.

113
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:29,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Done and done.

114
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record...

115
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:39,586
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone wants, I do have the GameShark or whatever codes there were for F-Zero AX on GameCube.

116
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

117
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:41,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

118
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Bobby, I did not realize this.

119
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:50,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby said AX tracks also unlocked if you beat all the cups on Master Difficulty.

120
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I never realized that.

121
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:52,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't that good.

122
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't as good as Bobby Blackwolf, clearly.

123
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is a way, I guess, for non...

124
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:22,149
[SPEAKER_07]: expert players yeah but hey the arcade though it tilted the one we had oh my god it did yeah it was you would actually go let you could go pretty high i don't think you went full sideways but you went a good like 45 degree angle either way it was so fun it was pretty cool so fun all right which which obviously means it didn't last at golf land so you know

125
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:26,073
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's go from what, 2002 or whenever that game came out?

126
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:27,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go from 2002 to 2025.

127
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Developers Conference happened this week.

128
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:38,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally, I knew it was, I always forget that that is actually during the week because it is for the industry.

129
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,419
[SPEAKER_07]: It is for people that work in the industry.

130
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a week.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Day Conference.

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always like, oh, GDC is this weekend.

133
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no, idiot.

134
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:45,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened during the week.

135
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did have a friend that went and said they got a lot out of it.

136
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:49,484
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a really good time.

137
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:51,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Who works in the industry and has reasons to go.

138
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it sounds like GDC was a good time.

139
00:08:54,446 --> 00:09:03,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we don't usually get a lot of gaming news out of GDC, but we have a few things tonight, including, I think, something that plays into...

140
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:11,956
[SPEAKER_07]: How the industry's kind of been for the last year and some of the not so great things and some of the changes that are happening as a result.

141
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, I'm going to turn this over to you to kick us off tonight.

142
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:31,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they announced the formation of the United Video Game Workers CWA, which was an industry-wide union formed by Code CWA and CWA Union.

143
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:51,125
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh so now they have basically almost like a SAG-AFTRA type of uh union that is not just centric to like one company for example it is just game developers as a whole across the board which I think gives them a little bit more leveraging power to you know get uh

144
00:09:51,966 --> 00:10:10,745
[SPEAKER_01]: better compensations you get you know better benefits that type of stuff protections um but yeah they said to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers but also to build large scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry um

145
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:13,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what they were doing.

146
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says for two thirds of the modern industrial history, there were no legal forms of unions.

147
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:25,360
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just humans coming together to organize as best they could to leverage against their employers for better conditions.

148
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:33,167
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you know, nowadays, you know, it seems to be very anti-union and very like

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:48,446
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, capitalistic in the sense that they're looking to exploit their workers and stuff we've had lots of stories about different layouts and whatnot but yeah, it's good to see that they're all more united front with that type of stuff

150
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:58,237
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be interesting to see how this develops, especially now that there is that more, like, anybody can access this type of thing, right?

151
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might see more smaller companies.

152
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:08,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't necessarily want to say indie, because I feel like indie is its own thing, but definitely like small, you know, there's video game studios out there that are, what, less than 20 people, easy.

153
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:13,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say, like, Hello Games, I think, who makes No Man's Sky, is a very small studio.

154
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, and let's not say that, like, you know, it's not going to necessarily be...

155
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:46,623
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect in the indie studios but a lot of the times the stuff that you see where you have you know exploit workers being exploited and stuff tends to be in the more larger studios where they're kind of beholden to shareholders and infinite growth and that type of stuff not to say that you know smaller studios don't have like crunch and other things that aren't necessarily good business practices anyways but um yeah it'll be interesting to see how that actually works out

156
00:11:47,796 --> 00:12:08,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think all of us have predicted some time ago that with all these layoffs that have been happening and the workers getting treated poorly and some of the things that came out of the dark parts of Activision Blizzard a few years ago, especially during COVID that led to all the protests, I think we all kind of foresaw that more and more people were going to unionize within the industry.

157
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's interesting to see it happen at this level.

158
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:13,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, it just sounds like it's needed.

159
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:20,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, with how long people work, we all know about the horrors of crunch time.

160
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I understand once in a while you got to do that to meet some deadlines and get the product out on shelves.

161
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:30,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, it's like, wait, sometimes it feels like... Don't make it an expectation, make it an exception.

162
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

163
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:35,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Too many companies are building it into part of their, you know, development plan.

164
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,736
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, it's getting ridiculous.

165
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:43,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, happy workers will inevitably make better games.

166
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So, well, I'm happy for the industry.

167
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:49,740
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why happy cows make better cheese, right?

168
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Better milk.

169
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to move on to the next segment.

170
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games.

171
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:58,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.

172
00:12:58,463 --> 00:12:58,943
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

173
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:00,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You see what I did there.

174
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:05,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

175
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:05,525
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

176
00:13:07,628 --> 00:13:09,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some Dead by Daylight.

177
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:15,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Chaos Shuffle again, and I'm like, meh, meh, meh, meh about it.

178
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:20,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I played some Monster Hunter Wilds.

179
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:25,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still getting used to the control scheme, which honestly sucks.

180
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I know it's been the same one always, it still sucks.

181
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Bell Outro.

182
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,766
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of it during my breaks.

183
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:38,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that game.

184
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think I would like it, but I like it.

185
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:46,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I have... I also played some Palia.

186
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I played... What else did I play?

187
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:52,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Shit, I don't remember what else I played.

188
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:53,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm old.

189
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Dragon Age.

190
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah.

191
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:00,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

192
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then we will move over to Loki.

193
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:03,477
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

194
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the same as every other week.

195
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:08,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been Minecraft.

196
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:09,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to surprise me someday.

197
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe someday, yeah.

198
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I still need to play Avowed.

199
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:23,416
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it's been mainly just Minecraft and then a little bit of Lotro in between everything.

200
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,037
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of content creation stuff.

201
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:26,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Your latest video looked really good.

202
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It was alright.

203
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:29,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

204
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,468
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck, Loki?

205
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta be your own hype man over there.

206
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:35,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Your latest video looked good.

207
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it did.

208
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it did.

209
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you know what you gotta do?

210
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta believe.

211
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:42,813
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gotta do what?

212
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:43,813
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gotta do what?

213
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:49,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to be speed.

214
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fine.

215
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:56,671
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the alright ones because otherwise you're spending a month editing something.

216
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,836
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what comes with the territory when you're putting out weekly content.

217
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:07,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm fine with it being okay right now.

218
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of in a rush.

219
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,322
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of...

220
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,410
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

221
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you're the worst.

222
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:45,955
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why you're not getting the subs.

223
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:49,018
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the worst hype man.

224
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:49,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fair.

225
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe in yourself as much as we do.

226
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,322
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I believe in myself.

227
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that the end is pretty boring.

228
00:15:56,326 --> 00:16:01,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the shaders make it look nice, but it's one of the things that everybody keeps complaining.

229
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:04,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, you guys need to do an end update because...

230
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:07,988
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty boring, you know, like there's nothing in there.

231
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:12,671
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of reason to go there outside of like Shulker Shells and Elytra.

232
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:21,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it could be better, but yeah, I mean, the shaders definitely make it look nice.

233
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we'll be talking about updates later on that are going to be coming very soon.

234
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Old promises coming back.

235
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:33,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it'll be fun.

236
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:34,097
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

237
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:35,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, do check out the video.

238
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:36,698
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

239
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, Loki's got a great collection on his YouTube.

240
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,319
[SPEAKER_07]: We all do stuff on the side.

241
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,560
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, of course, has Twitch.

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,560
[SPEAKER_07]: We just talked about that.

243
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, I mean, a lot of my time has been with the live hosting stuff, so it's a little harder to find.

244
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:57,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I try to get back on Twitch once in a while, but it is, I'm going to be honest, it's been kind of hard to make time, intentional time for Twitch lately.

245
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just kind of, I'm,

246
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just making the most of it

247
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:07,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

248
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:09,167
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week.

249
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:14,629
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, my gaming week, I don't have as much to talk about, but it's mostly the usual suspects, right?

250
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like Pokemon Go.

251
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the Totodile Day and caught more Shinies.

252
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:19,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

253
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:20,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, because I feel the need.

254
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:24,493
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and Ingress and Pikmin and other geolocation games.

255
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:26,173
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit more Diablo 4.

256
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:30,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I am now on tier 89 out of 90 for this season, so I'm almost done.

257
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I'm going to do the full completion of the quest.

258
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:36,680
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you unlock like a Raven pet or something, but it's just not worth it.

259
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:45,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to focus on beating some other games or continuing down the rabbit hole of things like Final Fantasy XIV, which has a big patch coming on Tuesday.

260
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore, I've been working very hard on the limited time cosmetic event that they're running.

261
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:51,413
[SPEAKER_07]: They do this Moogle Tome event is what they call it.

262
00:17:51,713 --> 00:18:19,446
[SPEAKER_07]: and they usually run it to try to keep people sort of engaged in the game before a patch because they know the content gets a little dry so they run some like really hard to get cosmetics normally from previous expansions we'll come back again for Moogle Tomes and running dungeons and helping people with the game and stuff like that so I have now hit 100 on Scholar which also means 100 on Summoner which I never play Summoner but I always play Scholar because it's the one job in the game that's kind of linked it's

263
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:30,768
[SPEAKER_07]: 1.0 did this weird shit where you had your class before you had your job and then so Arcanist can lead to both Scholar and Summoner.

264
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you level anything in the Arcanist tree, you're leveling both.

265
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:36,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it sounds complicated because it is.

266
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Final Fantasy XIV's biggest problem is the fact that it was built on top of 1.0.

267
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:46,912
[SPEAKER_07]: The creamy, gooey center of that game is still Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 which was what?

268
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:47,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrible.

269
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:48,532
[SPEAKER_07]: So

270
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:54,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And someday, they're really going to have to commit to uncoupling themselves.

271
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:58,954
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to take a major world-changing expansion to do that, but they need to do it.

272
00:18:59,574 --> 00:19:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Swear to God, they need to do it.

273
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:05,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they're just going to, at some point, they're just going to say, Final Fantasy XVII online, let's go.

274
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:09,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course I'll be there, because I'm a sucker for Square Enix online games.

275
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:11,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they'd still bring Dragon Quest X over here.

276
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:15,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we'd get online, or the offline Dragon Quest.

277
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take either, online or offline Dragon Quest X.

278
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they'll come over eventually.

279
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why they couldn't.

280
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:28,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and then I want Square to do a Final Fantasy XI offline, which I guess most of the game is solo at this point.

281
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know, right?

282
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:30,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on!

283
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:37,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that the latest raid in Final Fantasy XIV, the 24-man content, is Final Fantasy XI themed?

284
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:38,408
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

285
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:38,528
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

286
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:39,129
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

287
00:19:56,451 --> 00:20:17,265
[SPEAKER_07]: are in an area that is literally a copy of Upper Juno with like the auction house and everything except everything is like different looking and you see ghost figures where NPCs would have been in 11 and then there's all these different characters there from 14 and then you actually do the raid and you fight like the Shadow Lord is the last boss so it's

288
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:19,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat.

289
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: And they use, and yes, they bring back the battle music from Eleven.

290
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eleven had a great soundtrack.

291
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:33,958
[SPEAKER_07]: If y'all never played Eleven, and I understand why a lot of people didn't touch Eleven.

292
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:36,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It did not have the quality of life Perks of 14 have.

293
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But Eleven has a banger soundtrack.

294
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:39,882
[SPEAKER_07]: It really does.

295
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:40,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Eleven.

296
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:46,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the battle music sounded like because I had it swapped out with Final Fantasy X music.

297
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:46,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

298
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:47,995
[SPEAKER_07]: You had it Zanarkand.

299
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:51,120
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot about that.

300
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,981
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

301
00:20:53,047 --> 00:21:21,542
[SPEAKER_07]: so Loki and I used to live together years ago and when he would, let's say we were in a Valcrum Dooms, like we would play Eleven together, like on computers, like right next to each other and we would be in a Valcrum Dooms party and then it's like somebody engages a crab and then like, you know, I'm hearing the normal battle music and then over from Loki's computer I'm hearing, change my pitch up, smack my bitch up it was I mean, it was epic it was great it's the most late 90s, early aughts thing ever

302
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:24,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, oh, what was the other one?

303
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:31,847
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one was the Chocobo music was replaced with the Falkor's theme.

304
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you had the never-ending story music.

305
00:21:33,648 --> 00:21:34,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

306
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:35,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

307
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so cool.

308
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, anyway.

309
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:45,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I just remember playing that game with a controller and being able to pull off all of my macros with my bonus buttons on my controller.

310
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:47,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a great game.

311
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was built for the PS2.

312
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, controllers worked really well in that game.

313
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:53,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Controllers work well on 14 also.

314
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:56,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I found a better way.

315
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:04,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I need, like, a way to emulate Eleven offline and just play, like, on or something like that.

316
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that would be amazing.

317
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:12,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I really shouldn't endorse this because Final Fantasy is still a live continuing service.

318
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,070
[SPEAKER_07]: However...

319
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:21,534
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, recently... But I firmly believe it is a service that should be rolled up into one fee with Final Fantasy XIV at this point.

320
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd gladly pay it.

321
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:28,016
[SPEAKER_07]: We can call it... What would we call it instead of Xbox Game Pass?

322
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:29,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Squeenix Squeepass.

323
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:30,397
[SPEAKER_07]: The Squeepass!

324
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:35,839
[SPEAKER_07]: The Squeepass should have Final Fantasy XIV and XI.

325
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:36,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And what else?

326
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have that fucking triple triad from XI.

327
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember there was a separate XI triple triad thing?

328
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have that.

329
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:42,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Look.

330
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:43,962
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

331
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:14,418
[SPEAKER_07]: but you should look on there about how people talk about how to play Final Fantasy XI on the emulated PS2 when the PS2 and Xbox 360 versions were taken down a long time ago.

332
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:16,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Wink wink, nudge nudge.

333
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:30,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have to look and see how to do that because another thing I've been looking at recently is getting one of those because I have a lot of actual systems but I want one of those cheap I just want one of those cheap

334
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:56,776
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, emulation handhelds that you can just dump a bunch of ROMs on play stuff so like a Steam Deck but like off-brand but it would be like Android based or something like that just something cheap but they have them now, I mean technology is to a point where Playstation 2 is easy peasy to emulate that for the most part so I'm like portable Final Fantasy 11?

335
00:23:56,876 --> 00:23:57,116
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe

336
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So watch, we're going to get to our gaming weeks in like three weeks.

337
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki's going to be like, I didn't play Minecraft this week.

338
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:06,764
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you play?

339
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:07,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XI.

340
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:08,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did you do that?

341
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:10,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't talk about it.

342
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,831
[SPEAKER_07]: As he holds up a portable system.

343
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:16,471
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

344
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:22,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some other games that people get very excited about as we get into some gaming news.

345
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:25,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, I heard you like collecting.

346
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to put some collecting in your collecting, right, Loki?

347
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:27,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

348
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:30,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

349
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:42,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of cool because for the longest time, Lego hasn't had the rights to Pokemon as far as putting out Nintendo products.

350
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,538
[SPEAKER_07]: No, another company called Mega had it.

351
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking down because I have a Mega Block thing here.

352
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Mega Blocks, Mega Constructs.

353
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a big fan of Constructs back in the 80s.

354
00:24:52,221 --> 00:24:52,961
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my jam.

355
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:53,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Also Legos.

356
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,103
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, back then it's like your kid, you're like, hey...

357
00:24:58,567 --> 00:24:59,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the blocks push?

358
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I use these blocks with Legos?

359
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:01,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

360
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:02,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

361
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:03,729
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine with me.

362
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:06,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like, oh, it has to be Lego.

363
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:13,433
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, yeah, Mega has had the rights to the Pokemon franchise for a long time.

364
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:16,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, their sets aren't bad.

365
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:17,334
[SPEAKER_01]: They really aren't.

366
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:18,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a few of them for my son.

367
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:19,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a

368
00:25:20,055 --> 00:25:48,225
[SPEAKER_01]: you know like a 12 inch tall Pikachu and stuff like that and they're really cool and they've had some really cool sets but now uh starting in 2026 the rights are going to be going back to Lego and they're going to have the rights the exclusive rights I assume to make Pokemon products um so yeah be interesting to see what they come up with because honestly like I said you know the the mega stuff it wasn't all that bad like I don't know I don't know why

369
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:52,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the hate was for, but, like, it'd be interesting.

370
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,333
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of cool sets coming out Nintendo-wise.

371
00:25:56,753 --> 00:26:00,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I gotta get that Mario Kart one that's coming out in, like, two months here, but one month.

372
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:01,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, one month.

373
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:02,397
[SPEAKER_01]: May 1st, I think.

374
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:09,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking in chat, S2100Matt says, the fandom surcharge will be real with those sets and will gladly pay it.

375
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

376
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:10,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you will.

377
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,604
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a thing.

378
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:16,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that is one of the things with the Mega sets is...

379
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:39,265
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't super expensive like Nintendo and well Nintendo and Lego are very much like they are premium price sets so that is the only downside with that um but it's fine I mean I would say if you're interested you will be tested how bad do you want this Pikachu you will be tested

380
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:43,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta be honest, the Pikachu set that's out now, they have multiples.

381
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,571
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one that animates, it looks like it's running.

382
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:49,434
[SPEAKER_01]: They have another one you can get with Ash and Pikachu, I think.

383
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full, not full-sized Ash, but obviously it's a pretty decent-sized Ash and Pikachu.

384
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:04,325
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good sets out there, so if you're really interested in getting one of those and you don't want to pay the premium...

385
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would say, you know, check that out.

386
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:10,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope these are minifig scale sets would be kind of cool.

387
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:19,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously they'll do some larger stuff, but I think it'd be really cool to have like actual, you know, like ash minifigs and stuff like that, you know, all that, but...

388
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:24,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, check those clearance bins at wherever you're shopping.

389
00:27:24,884 --> 00:27:27,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where people are shopping these days because everybody's pissed at Target.

390
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:34,491
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's where I know in the past I got my Mega Block set for, I have a Squirtle, came from Target.

391
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the Pokemon Lego things start coming in, the Mega ones are going to end up in the clearance bins.

392
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:43,237
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably can get some of those for real cheap as they offload them.

393
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:43,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye out.

394
00:27:44,795 --> 00:28:12,485
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and they're around I mean there's a lot of places that'll sell those because like they don't move very fast but they have a lot of cool stuff they have a little pixel like you can do they're like little mosaics that are the sprites from the Game Boy version stuff like that that are pretty cool with all the starters at least quite a few of the starters I mean there's a lot of sets out there I really recommend you go check them out before the Lego stuff comes out and obviously that's still a year away so we got time

395
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:21,314
[SPEAKER_07]: As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, the thing that I hope doesn't happen is that whenever they do minifigs of Pokemon, that the Pokemon scalpers don't make it miserable.

396
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:25,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Lego is pretty good at flooding the market where it is not a thing for scalpers to be bums.

397
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:29,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think it's going to be an issue, but yeah, it sucks.

398
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, reasonable concern.

399
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,061
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they could do that would be fucked up?

400
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:35,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

401
00:28:36,302 --> 00:28:39,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do this just because of my friend Shane, who's obsessed with Shinies.

402
00:28:40,404 --> 00:28:48,768
[SPEAKER_07]: What if one in every 256 boxes, the bricks were different colors and they let you build shiny Pokemon?

403
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if they would do that.

404
00:29:09,426 --> 00:29:10,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them ideas.

405
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already had the idea.

406
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:18,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so apparently the next, so the trading card pocket game, I didn't talk about it in my game movie.

407
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:20,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I still play that just about every day.

408
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:25,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Def said, I stopped my Bellatro session to yell at Rob.

409
00:29:25,896 --> 00:29:26,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

410
00:29:28,217 --> 00:29:31,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I still play the Pokemon trading card game just about every day.

411
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:32,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been slacking a little bit.

412
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Those of you that play the game know how it goes.

413
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:44,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you open the game and it says max number of packs available, two packs available, which means you've been getting your unoptimal number of packs per day.

414
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:48,184
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, oh, fuck, I missed out on getting my maximum number of packs.

415
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:48,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

416
00:29:50,265 --> 00:30:11,971
[SPEAKER_07]: so um apparently the next pack that is coming to that game next week is like a shiny themed pack and I was like oh fuck does that mean you only have like one in 256 chance or something to pull a shiny card but apparently no apparently it is at least in chat please correct me if I'm wrong because sometimes I'm wrong on this stuff um

417
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Mike Def says it's just shiny art, so that's good.

418
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:14,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

419
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:42,727
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, imagine that game has been doing pretty well and they're starting to crank out the expansions a little more often.

420
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:44,528
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

421
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:49,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Def says it's also the same card with the same effects and stats.

422
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:54,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that makes sense because isn't that the way the foil... No, sometimes the foils will have like an extra move or something, huh?

423
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:59,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not, and you guys have to remember, I'm not as deep down the well of the trading card game.

424
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:15,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I never touched it before that phone game, but I've got to say, the trading card pocket game, like, I hate to hype a game that I'm not being paid to do, but it's very addicting and fun to just collect the cards, even if you don't really play the game in it.

425
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:16,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

426
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:21,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, yeah, Def says that's what they normally do with the shiny sets in the real-life card game.

427
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's good to know.

428
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

429
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, I don't know how we got from LEGO Pokemon to that, but we did.

430
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:31,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So, let's move on and talk about... How do we get to any topic?

431
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because the tangent train says... Beep, beep, I'm here.

432
00:31:34,725 --> 00:31:35,405
[SPEAKER_07]: You do.

433
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:44,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, let's talk about... We mentioned on the show a few weeks ago that Good Old Games, or GOG, was going to be starting this preservation program.

434
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:51,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think at the time, we'd kind of said, well, isn't this just a rebrand of kind of like what they're already talking about doing anyway?

435
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is, you know, they want to...

436
00:31:53,397 --> 00:32:03,121
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that, you know, a lot more gamers are being aware of this idea that sometimes games are no longer available.

437
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:10,303
[SPEAKER_07]: They're no longer playable because maybe they were online only or they, you know, they're on a system that's very hard to find copies.

438
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:16,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I think just earlier in chat, DarkTetsuya was saying something about trying to get a copy of F-Zero GX now.

439
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

440
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:44,272
[SPEAKER_07]: is dollars like it's it's not a cheap game um it's probably not as expensive as like some of the Saturn classics that Jamie brings up on the show but I it's probably cost more than you know it did when it came out so good old games you know their original sort of MO was uh releasing classic games and then to try to turn a better profit they started kind of getting in the market of current games as well but it's all DRM free and has manuals all this stuff

441
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:46,112
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:18,579
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this week, GOG announced Silent Hill for The Room.

443
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,120
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of surprising.

444
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that kind of out of left field?

445
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was a better game than people give it credit for.

446
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,043
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not left field.

447
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,304
[SPEAKER_04]: That's somebody else's field.

448
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:30,565
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a good pick.

449
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:32,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the room.

450
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,241
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, Silent Hill 4 is going to get added to that.

451
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:38,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Deus Ex, which a lot of people love that game.

452
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:42,063
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Fear is also joining that as well.

453
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:49,326
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they are saying 20 new games being added to that, including, oh my god, this makes me happy, all 8

454
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:51,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Wing Commander 1 and 2

455
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:12,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That's brilliant because I think a lot of people try to go back and play Wing Commander 1 and 2 and the clock speed is way too fast.

456
00:34:12,914 --> 00:34:17,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there's tools out there to adjust, play with them, find the right setting, all that stuff.

457
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:24,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just love that people can now experience the classic fucking... These are like... Y'all have to remember for...

458
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,007
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

459
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Port Royale 3 Gold, Alien Breed and Tower Assault, Privateer 2 The Darkening, and Cannon Fodder and Cannon Fodder 2.

460
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,392
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the games going into the program now.

461
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:57,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's â€“ I will give credit where credit is due.

462
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:02,037
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first talked about this, I was like, this is just kind of like a marketing thing for GOG.

463
00:35:02,077 --> 00:35:04,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just to remind people they sell the classic games.

464
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,502
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that they are coming back and saying we're adding more and they're â€“ these aren't â€“ some of these are â€“

465
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,605
[SPEAKER_07]: There's big games coming to this that will probably catch your attention.

466
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:19,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf saying, Wing Commander 1 and 2 was my jam.

467
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't run them on my 486.

468
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Too fast.

469
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

470
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:28,532
[SPEAKER_07]: But now you can run them with this program.

471
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:29,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's great.

472
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:31,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So kudos.

473
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:33,214
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura with other stuff out of GDC.

474
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:06,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there was, of course, the Game Developers Choice Award 2025 and Game of the Year is Bellagio.

475
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Kermit Flail.

476
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I really don't think anyone is super surprised.

477
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of surprised because, I mean, there was what else?

478
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Astro Bot.

479
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:19,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Astro Bot.

480
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:39,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, Astro Bot I'm not even seeing it on the list at all I see Astro Bot for Best Technology and Bellator won Game of the Year and Best Design and Innovation Award and Best Debut so I wouldn't say it's a total sweep but it was pretty big

481
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:44,169
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good year for an indie to really be celebrated like that.

482
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if I've talked about how Bellatro didn't click for me.

483
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:52,175
[SPEAKER_07]: But boy, the more my co-hosts talk about playing it all the time, I'm like, I really need to just suck it up and try it again.

484
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's on Xbox Game Pass too.

485
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was on Steam and I play through Apple Arcade now.

486
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I really dig with it is just that it's something that I can have open on the side while I'm doing other things.

487
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:36,114
[SPEAKER_04]: you know so like if I'm say watching a documentary you know because you know me I love documentaries then I might keep it open just to have something to do with my hands while I'm watching something I thought it was your Chinese 90s dramas or whatever was your thing okay so uh-oh uh-oh she done went there when I was she done went there when I was watching I finished the one um

488
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:41,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I started another one to realize I'd actually already watched it.

489
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:45,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually a sequel to the one, so I started another one.

490
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:47,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've detected a theme.

491
00:37:48,304 --> 00:38:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I've detected that when the women in the harem hit that point where they have had too much and want to escape living, they run full blast with their heads into solid objects.

492
00:38:03,598 --> 00:38:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

493
00:38:04,379 --> 00:38:09,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the theme of every single one of them is ram your head into an object if you want to no longer exist.

494
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:10,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you know.

495
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:14,025
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're ready for reincarnation, run into the wall.

496
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:21,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, yeah, and everything bad has to, something really bad has to happen every episode.

497
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:24,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, but wait, there's a twist.

498
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:26,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they go.

499
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:26,834
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they all go.

500
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:27,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I digress.

501
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:30,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what happens on this show.

502
00:38:31,097 --> 00:38:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at chat, Dr. Tia talking about Bellatro says, I'm probably not great at poker, and I did try it after it showed up on Game Pass.

503
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Might have to give it another try, but it's neat.

504
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,687
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bobby says, exactly.

505
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby says, the only thing it shares with poker is what the hands are.

506
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:48,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say, if you've ever played Yahtzee, or Yacht, I guess, as it's called in some collections,

507
00:38:49,795 --> 00:39:02,980
[SPEAKER_07]: it that has about as much in common with poker as well like it's just it's like the scoring mechanisms and how you get things but like Yahtzee is like a very different game that just is scored similarly to poker if that makes sense

508
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:09,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they basically, outside the terminology and some of the gameplay, it's completely different.

509
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

510
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:11,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

511
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:21,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf also says about these GDC awards, these are your real awards, but nobody cares because they show no game trailers.

512
00:39:21,264 --> 00:39:22,005
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're right.

513
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:23,485
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no lies detected.

514
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:26,125
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the problem with the cycle of that.

515
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:29,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they don't do game awards and because they aren't...

516
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:31,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

517
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:53,375
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

518
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:13,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

519
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:14,696
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

520
00:40:15,737 --> 00:40:21,382
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have to remember in the future, GDC week is when that happens.

521
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:21,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

522
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:27,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this isn't on the show roll for tonight, but surely...

523
00:40:28,328 --> 00:40:28,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I saw that.

524
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

525
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so fun!

526
00:40:58,965 --> 00:41:00,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks so cute!

527
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:01,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't this the best?

528
00:41:02,387 --> 00:41:02,547
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

529
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:03,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this.

530
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:05,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, no, wait.

531
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:11,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna tell you right now, like, the cat that we have come over all the time, that is how she wants to be pet.

532
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,915
[SPEAKER_01]: She just gets butt up in the air.

533
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:15,696
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

534
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,858
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so weird, but that is so accurate.

535
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:19,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

536
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:22,781
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I don't need to put money into that because I have a cat.

537
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smack her butt all the time.

538
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:26,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I still would play that game.

539
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:27,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

540
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:31,668
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, I want someone to beat a Souls game with that controller.

541
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:32,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sure.

542
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:33,330
[SPEAKER_07]: GDQ next year?

543
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

544
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:34,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

545
00:41:35,812 --> 00:41:40,575
[SPEAKER_07]: What about installing Doom on that TV and playing Doom with the cat butt?

546
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:41,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's going to happen.

547
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:45,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Just give the internet a little time, people.

548
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:45,900
[SPEAKER_07]: A little time.

549
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been...

550
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,421
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to see when this gets to round one.

551
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:50,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

552
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that was... I still haven't been to that round one, by the way.

553
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:53,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

554
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

555
00:41:55,223 --> 00:42:00,565
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to like really do a night out because we talked about a night out at the movies and didn't end up doing it, but it was... And then I was sick.

556
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was a long week for me at work.

557
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:07,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, no, we need to do a trip to round one.

558
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:10,768
[SPEAKER_07]: My weekend should be more free next weekend, so maybe we can do that.

559
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:11,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

560
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:35,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I still want to see that movie too but the movie might be harder to find uh because uh you know because Warner Brothers I heard they did extend it another week though so it's did you hear about Wiley or Acme yes I did that's actually great it's the same distributor that did this movie right isn't that great that they get to write it off for taxes and sell it yeah that's

561
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:36,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

562
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,112
[SPEAKER_07]: This same distribution company, what is it called?

563
00:42:39,152 --> 00:42:40,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Painters or something?

564
00:42:40,512 --> 00:42:40,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that their name?

565
00:42:41,132 --> 00:42:41,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Ketchup.

566
00:42:41,913 --> 00:42:42,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, Ketchup.

567
00:42:42,533 --> 00:42:42,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

568
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Where the fuck did I get Painters from?

569
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:45,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

570
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:53,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Ketchup apparently offered 50 million for Coyote vs. Acme to do a full theatrical release and all that stuff with it.

571
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:55,596
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody on the internet is like, yes, bitch.

572
00:42:56,217 --> 00:42:56,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

573
00:42:57,759 --> 00:42:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Could happen.

574
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:01,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and PodCulture says, now I want Batgirl, damn it.

575
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:02,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really surprised.

576
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:07,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how much money Netflix spent on that fucking bomb they just released?

577
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:08,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember the name of it.

578
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:11,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the Stranger Things girl in it, who's a woman now.

579
00:43:11,586 --> 00:43:12,906
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like 21.

580
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $320 million.

581
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:15,788
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the electric state.

582
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:16,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the book.

583
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:16,928
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

584
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:17,369
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

585
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:17,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got the book.

586
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:18,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it good?

587
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:18,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you watch the movie?

588
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:19,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it good?

589
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:19,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard it wasn't.

590
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I did watch the movie.

591
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,931
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing.

592
00:43:22,231 --> 00:43:23,372
[SPEAKER_01]: The movie is...

593
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the environment.

594
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I like everything about it.

595
00:43:27,653 --> 00:43:36,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read the book yet, so I don't know how accurate to the book it is, but it just seemed like the writing was bad, is what it was.

596
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:39,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else was fine with it, it's just the writing was bad.

597
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:47,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And based off of what I heard with the Russo brothers and stuff, it's basically like, oh yeah, we like the imagery in the book.

598
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:49,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.

599
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:50,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you read the book?

600
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:53,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you incorporate the themes of the book?

601
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:54,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you read a comic book?

602
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Who reads?

603
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read without pictures.

604
00:43:57,194 --> 00:44:00,456
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even that big of a... We had Lea Michele analyze it for us.

605
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:03,837
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, yeah, so that it's

606
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright.

607
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I liked it.

608
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:08,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It was alright.

609
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like an exciting movie that I'd have to go back and watch again?

610
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:12,082
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

611
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:13,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, absolutely not.

612
00:44:14,262 --> 00:44:22,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you like the idea of what they're doing with that and want to execute it better, I hear Tales from the Loop is better.

613
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:24,705
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another book that's by the same author.

614
00:44:25,505 --> 00:44:27,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an Amazon series.

615
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:35,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The point I really wanted to make is that for that amount of money, Netflix could have made 10 movies for $32 million, which is a pretty modest, you know, pretty decent budget for a movie.

616
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Could have made 10 movies for $32 million.

617
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:44,389
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have been a great, if they just like had better writing and just extended it out for a series, this would have made a really good series.

618
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:50,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot that they could do with the environment and the imagery that's in that, that they kind of rushed through.

619
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it was kind of explained away, just like,

620
00:44:54,386 --> 00:45:23,449
[SPEAKER_01]: barely it's just exposition dump and then it's just you know a thing happens and then we go do the thing and now we gotta go to this place and do this thing and there's no stakes really like they have these other like evil robots and it's like okay here are the evil robots and they're gone like it was just as quickly as they were introduced they were a threat for like 30 seconds and then then they're gone

621
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:25,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

622
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:25,895
[SPEAKER_01]: All done.

623
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:27,136
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

624
00:45:27,156 --> 00:45:31,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not only can Loki talk about movies, but there's another topic you'd love to talk about, Loki.

625
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:33,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

626
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:33,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

627
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to it.

628
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:35,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about Minecraft.

629
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:35,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

630
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday was Minecraft Live.

631
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,042
[SPEAKER_01]: They've now committed to doing two per year.

632
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:52,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So whereas it used to be like one big event that they would talk about, you know, the next big updates coming now that they've switched to a smaller like quarterly drop event.

633
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,366
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

634
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:25,623
[SPEAKER_01]: New Grass Options Dead Bushes

635
00:46:41,058 --> 00:47:06,435
[SPEAKER_01]: WindGusty Sounds, so it's a lot of ambient detailed stuff that's coming with this next update which will be out on Tuesday and then they talked about showing off the first feature of the update coming out after that which is now this new version of the gas which is like this big balloon ghost thing that has a weird baby cry to it

636
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:33,859
[SPEAKER_01]: um but now it's called the dry gassed and you find them in the soul sand valleys and basically you hydrate them with water and then they become a friendly gas that you could ride and put cool steampunk goggles on and just ride this giant like airship thing it's kind of like the movie trailer but not like in the sense those are more set up like hot air balloons these are just like sitting on a giant balloon and just riding on the top of it um

637
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,869
[SPEAKER_01]: They did show off a little bit more of the Minecraft movie, another clip of it, which is just more of Steve yelling out game mechanics for Minecraft.

638
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:57,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, you know, like the modern day, you know, landscape of video entertainment on television and movies, it seems to be that what is hampering a lot of this stuff is bad writing.

639
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately with the Minecraft movie, I feel that's also going to be a thing because it's just, it's, it, it's explaining too much.

640
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:11,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't need to explain like, those are the villagers.

641
00:48:11,753 --> 00:48:11,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

642
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:16,626
[SPEAKER_01]: We can gather that from the game or something.

643
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:20,148
[SPEAKER_07]: But how else are they going to know what toys to look for on the store shelves?

644
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:21,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they don't need to.

645
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:22,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's this movie for then?

646
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,031
[SPEAKER_01]: The toy companies, that's who the movie's for.

647
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:31,835
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never heard of Minecraft, then I don't think that you need to explain all the mechanics.

648
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:33,216
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for people that...

649
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:39,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Play Minecraft or like enjoy it like for kids that obviously are familiar with all this stuff.

650
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:47,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't have to explain, you know, Loki, Loki, Mel Brooks said it best merchandising, merchandising, merchandising.

651
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

652
00:48:49,504 --> 00:48:55,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, they've already done the merchandising with the horrible Jack Black mini fig that you can get for the movie.

653
00:48:57,293 --> 00:49:00,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some of the action figures, or inaction figures I should say

654
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:28,819
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah they're scary looking but yeah so that's some of the stuff that's going to be coming we'll probably get some more updates with the Minecraft monthlies that they do and then of course that stuff will start dropping in snapshots here probably pretty soon as soon as this next update comes out

655
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:56,760
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm excited for it, I think it looks cool the rumors I've heard about the next update are like they were talking about doing some tweaks with horses as well like giving them horseshoes and stuff so it sounds like it could be maybe centered around transportation being that this is a new method of transportation with this flying friendly gas thing so it'll be interesting to see what happens but I'm excited and I'm excited to see the movie even though it's probably not going to be great

656
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:58,939
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

657
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I look forward to your review on if I should bother or not.

658
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:02,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

659
00:50:02,942 --> 00:50:03,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on.

660
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:06,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is some of the most shocking news of the week.

661
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I have to talk about when companies do things right and when companies do things wrong.

662
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:18,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk about a story tonight where the ESA, yes, the Entertainment Software Association, has done something useful.

663
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:20,814
[SPEAKER_07]: This is incredible.

664
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:21,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh?

665
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:24,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Accessible Games Initiative Accessible Games Initiative

666
00:50:42,112 --> 00:50:51,698
[SPEAKER_07]: and Nintendo is going to be one of the founding members along with EA, Microsoft, Google and Ubisoft which honestly reads like a rogues gallery but here we are.

667
00:50:52,039 --> 00:50:54,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Bizarro world is here everybody.

668
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:01,605
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the Accessible Games Initiative is going to start with those five founding members but I do believe there's more as well.

669
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I heard somewhere Sony is going to be involved with that and some other companies too.

670
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:06,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That already sounds exciting.

671
00:51:06,328 --> 00:51:06,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

672
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:12,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the idea is clear information about accessibility features within the video games.

673
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:16,093
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be tags that will have clear criteria.

674
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:26,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So some tags will highlight games that have clear text, large subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion, save any time, and things like that.

675
00:51:26,419 --> 00:51:30,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nintendo of America is going to introduce these tags in the future.

676
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:37,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So when publishers add support for the accessible games initiative tags, you can find them in the My Nintendo Store, right?

677
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:42,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're kind of doing more of our shopping for games online by these tags.

678
00:51:42,986 --> 00:51:46,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So these tags are going to help you find what games are accessible.

679
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:47,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty logical, right?

680
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:48,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

681
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:57,471
[SPEAKER_07]: They are saying that this is going to help consumers, going to help the players to find information about these video games before you plunk down the $70 or whatever they cost to buy them as well.

682
00:51:57,931 --> 00:52:03,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Other games that are committed to this, Amazon Games, Riot Games, Squeenix, Warner Brothers.

683
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:15,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, reads like the Rogues Gallery of Evil, but this is a great thing and a broken clock is right twice a day, so let's call out the time because it's looking good.

684
00:52:16,377 --> 00:52:31,047
[SPEAKER_07]: In a comment, the current president and CEO of the ESA, Stanley Pierre-Louis, said it was an industry-wide pursuit, saying, quote, Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that come with playing video games.

685
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:35,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders.

686
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:43,996
[SPEAKER_07]: This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play.

687
00:52:44,656 --> 00:52:45,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.

688
00:52:45,877 --> 00:52:47,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta fucking hand it to them.

689
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Games are for everyone.

690
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:56,324
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the perfect fucking time to announce this when a lot of the developers are kind of paying attention right now.

691
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:57,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

692
00:52:57,765 --> 00:52:59,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go, ESA.

693
00:52:59,627 --> 00:53:02,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to award you one clap.

694
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:03,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go.

695
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,391
[SPEAKER_07]: One clap from Rob Roberts.

696
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:07,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

697
00:53:07,238 --> 00:53:07,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

698
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:10,319
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this really is a good thing.

699
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,660
[SPEAKER_07]: More of this energy, please.

700
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:21,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Now do Game Workers Rights next, but you won't because you represent the publishers, which are usually the ones.

701
00:53:21,842 --> 00:53:23,762
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to challenge.

702
00:53:24,343 --> 00:53:25,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Do Working Conditions next.

703
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Map.

704
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:38,189
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 Matt in chat says, ESA doing the right thing is like the Washington Generals beating the Harlem Grobetrotters once every 50 years.

705
00:53:39,671 --> 00:53:41,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that part.

706
00:53:41,673 --> 00:53:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, I think, you know, and maybe this is it too.

707
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:48,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to look into this before I run my mouth.

708
00:53:51,966 --> 00:53:56,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody buy me time, because I need to, before I run my mouth here.

709
00:53:56,509 --> 00:54:00,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's Rob looking up stuff, but we like a fact check here in this house, right?

710
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:00,772
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

711
00:54:01,452 --> 00:54:02,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We sure do.

712
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:13,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, some people in charge of things in this universe, gonna say, but... I was told there'd be no fact checking.

713
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:16,002
[SPEAKER_04]: You were lied to.

714
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:17,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Lies!

715
00:54:19,825 --> 00:54:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, many lives.

716
00:54:21,046 --> 00:54:25,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to figure out, okay, my thought is, how long has the CEO been there?

717
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:30,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't he newer to the organization?

718
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:31,691
[SPEAKER_07]: No, since 2019.

719
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:33,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, hmm.

720
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:36,494
[SPEAKER_01]: He's there since about four times.

721
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:36,934
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

722
00:54:39,055 --> 00:54:39,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know then.

723
00:54:39,636 --> 00:54:41,297
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I thought they had recently replaced.

724
00:54:41,537 --> 00:54:42,857
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's why I fact-checked live.

725
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:43,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind then.

726
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:44,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

727
00:54:45,168 --> 00:54:45,428
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

728
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's move on then.

729
00:54:47,729 --> 00:54:48,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate the fact-checking.

730
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:49,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

731
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So, see, I didn't run my mouth for once.

732
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:51,571
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

733
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:57,314
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, why don't you give us the facts on what one of our favorite game devs of the past is up to?

734
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:01,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we like ourselves a Katamari.

735
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:03,918
[SPEAKER_04]: We've left our mark on a Katamari in real life.

736
00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we left a very tiny CD on it.

737
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,540
[SPEAKER_07]: We left our mark on their Wikipedia article for one of their games.

738
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we did.

739
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:10,201
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

740
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:10,761
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts.

741
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,343
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts also on there, too.

742
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:37,743
[SPEAKER_04]: but Takahashi Keita who we love for Katamari and also for Nobi Nobi Boy and a few other interesting things has told us why he left Bandai Namco in 2010 because he wanted to share experiences with different developers to go all over the world and get different ideas from other people

743
00:55:40,926 --> 00:55:43,428
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes to see what different customs are around the world.

744
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:44,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go ahead and read a quote.

745
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: American schools don't have the custom of changing shoes like Japanese schools do.

746
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:52,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I was once asked by a team member about what the school space full of shoe cupboards was like.

747
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:59,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to convey to them that there are loads of shoes and that there's a kind of smell, but it really is something that's unique to Japan.

748
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:19,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what school culture is like in the US so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements so basically he wants to explore all different cultures and be able to incorporate the things that he learns into different games he wants to be able to understand his target audience and we don't have enough people doing that I love it

749
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:28,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some, you know, I feel like the news about this gentleman comes around like once every few years.

750
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:38,149
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's kind of, yeah, I think it's, I think a change in atmosphere once in a while is a really good thing, especially in artistic sort of industries.

751
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:38,610
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

752
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,491
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it absolutely is.

753
00:56:40,611 --> 00:56:44,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we, like I was just saying, we need more of that happening.

754
00:56:44,213 --> 00:56:44,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

755
00:56:45,959 --> 00:57:07,573
[SPEAKER_04]: you know it's we get too many I think games out there where it's just sort of not necessarily that it's a true cookie cutter but that it falls into a very targeted trap uh you know trap that you're only you know you're gonna get money out of these people so make it for these people right yeah um

756
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:34,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I just I have feelings about it but I think that that I mean well I mean it's true we really do need more people willing to put that kind of legwork into it who want to understand the gamers who want to understand that there are bigger stories to be told well I look forward to playing to a tee very soon

757
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:37,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll definitely check it out.

758
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:40,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a game I won't be checking out.

759
00:57:41,381 --> 00:57:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be May 28th, by the way.

760
00:57:44,204 --> 00:57:47,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving into a game I won't be checking out, but no shade.

761
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:50,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not my preferred thing, but Loki?

762
00:57:52,217 --> 00:58:04,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so EA College Football apparently is offering more money to college players to appear in the game.

763
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:09,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just shocked at the amount of money that they get.

764
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:18,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So previously, they would get $600 and a free copy of the game to appear in the

765
00:58:18,757 --> 00:58:19,797
[SPEAKER_01]: The NCA game.

766
00:58:19,957 --> 00:58:23,999
[SPEAKER_01]: A game that, you know, essentially is about them in the first place.

767
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:26,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, though, they're being super generous.

768
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:32,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Mind you, this is a multi-billion dollar company and this game makes billions of dollars each year.

769
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:37,883
[SPEAKER_01]: They are upping that from $600 to $1,500 now if they will license their likeness to EA.

770
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:37,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

771
00:58:45,942 --> 00:58:58,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's just for the one year, because I could see them using AI to do stuff with these players and stuff, but that seems awfully low for putting these players in the game.

772
00:58:58,976 --> 00:59:01,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all better write that AI shit in the contract.

773
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, if we have any college football players that listen to this show...

774
00:59:07,193 --> 00:59:12,796
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have any, you better write that anti-AI shit into your contracts.

775
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:17,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not sign if they have the right to use AI in your likeness for anything.

776
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you really want it.

777
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:21,620
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just awfully low, considering that, like, what, $600?

778
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's...

779
00:59:24,825 --> 00:59:25,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's not...

780
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:54,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a little different than maybe when there's only like 21 players on a team and 21 teams.

781
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:59,757
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a lot more people play college football than you might think off the top of your head.

782
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:02,580
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I do understand that.

783
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,862
[SPEAKER_04]: College football is religion in the South.

784
01:00:05,262 --> 01:00:06,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

785
01:00:06,923 --> 01:00:12,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, if it's just, you know, like their stat and maybe like their likeness in the game, I...

786
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:14,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

787
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:23,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard for me to say what is fair and what is not fair, but if you are one of these people and you don't feel you're being compensated appropriately, you have the right to ask for more.

788
01:00:24,027 --> 01:00:29,090
[SPEAKER_07]: You might get told no, and it might be some hard bargaining, but you don't know if you don't ask.

789
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:40,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would suppose it would depend on, you know, I don't know who the celebrities are in that sort of realm, but maybe there's some people that might feel entitled to a little more money, but then I don't know how it gets all...

790
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:46,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you with union agreements at the collegiate level and all that stuff.

791
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

792
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

793
01:00:49,658 --> 01:00:50,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I...

794
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,021
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, it is double.

795
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:55,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, I mean, it is going up.

796
01:00:55,821 --> 01:01:12,267
[SPEAKER_07]: It does sound, I think it, I think it sounds bad because you think about your big football players and why in my brain do when I say big football players, I go like Joe Montana, like my brain, my brain is still rooting for the 49ers in 1985.

797
01:01:12,387 --> 01:01:13,848
[SPEAKER_07]: That is like where my brain goes.

798
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:16,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Big football players like Joe Montana.

799
01:01:16,929 --> 01:01:19,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, that's,

800
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:22,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would be commanding a lot more money.

801
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:24,748
[SPEAKER_07]: But for these college players...

802
01:01:25,743 --> 01:01:43,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's... I would say to my point, though, if it's too expensive to make your game because you have to pay people fairly, and you're like, well, I just can't do this if I can't pay them unfairly, then you can't make your game!

803
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:44,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry!

804
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,781
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do it then.

805
01:01:47,362 --> 01:01:48,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

806
01:01:48,843 --> 01:01:53,027
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems ridiculous to... That is such little money...

807
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, at the end, Bobby does point out players do opt out.

808
01:01:58,037 --> 01:01:58,677
[SPEAKER_07]: You can opt out.

809
01:01:58,777 --> 01:01:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not bound to this.

810
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, if you don't think it's enough money, you have the right to opt out, which is good.

811
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,140
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't sign it.

812
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good.

813
01:02:05,281 --> 01:02:20,229
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah, I mean, honestly, it just seems considering the amount of money that people make or demand for different things and considering how much money this company rakes in with Madden and

814
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,332
[SPEAKER_01]: and E-Ink.

815
01:02:23,852 --> 01:02:28,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say, isn't Ultimate Team part of the college one as well?

816
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:34,761
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of money, and there's absolutely no reason they couldn't pay more.

817
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:35,781
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you feel?

818
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:39,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just hypothetically.

819
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:45,563
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you feel about a deal where if instead of a flat figure, there was a likeness pool?

820
01:02:46,123 --> 01:02:56,646
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to pool all the players together into one financial pool that is like, we'll say 3% of the profits of the game go into this financial pool that will pay all of the players equally for their likenesses.

821
01:02:57,346 --> 01:02:58,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think that's fine.

822
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:00,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

823
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,410
Okay.

824
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:09,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be curious how the math is mathing when all is said and done because Bobby does provide some good figures here saying that it was basically $8.5 million at $600 a pop.

825
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:11,975
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is going to be much more money.

826
01:03:12,095 --> 01:03:23,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if they are spending a pretty good percentage of the actual profits on this, then it probably just â€“ it really â€“ it's like those fucking class action lawsuits you get the emails about.

827
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get a big old fucking check.

828
01:03:25,641 --> 01:03:26,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get the check in the mail.

829
01:03:26,862 --> 01:03:27,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And you get â€“

830
01:03:27,522 --> 01:03:56,324
[SPEAKER_07]: it's $4.06 and it's like because so many people did it it got split between all those people so I feel like there's similar mathiness going on here where it's just there's a lot of people entitled to the money let's see so college football 25 um so let's see here um

831
01:03:57,489 --> 01:04:03,175
[SPEAKER_01]: It says they only opted in, there's only 10,000 athletes Only 10,000?

832
01:04:05,438 --> 01:04:18,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they had opted in for, yeah, so it was like 6 million, I guess, would that be, I think that's 6 million with $600 each But the game, let's see, so the game itself, I'm trying to see what the sales numbers were on this real quick

833
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:25,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess, yeah, you add up 105 players on 10,000 players.

834
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:31,280
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, again, it's a lot of people to split the money between.

835
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,180
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's happening.

836
01:04:35,242 --> 01:04:35,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

837
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I get it.

838
01:04:37,064 --> 01:04:43,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think, you know, at launch it says more than 2.8 million players.

839
01:04:44,669 --> 01:04:48,352
[SPEAKER_01]: It says 2.2 million whom purchased the deluxe edition of the game.

840
01:04:50,379 --> 01:05:06,105
[SPEAKER_01]: so 2.8 million uh 70 dollars a game i mean that's like but then shave the 30 off that the retail gets unless it was sold direct i mean math gets hard right no like most but yeah okay

841
01:05:06,585 --> 01:05:32,545
[SPEAKER_01]: but retail is hardly a dent in any of this stuff it's mostly digital nowadays so that 30% they're just taking the 30% so I think that kind of washes probably more so on the publisher side they probably get a lot more of that 30% because it's not the Wild West days where it's small independent stores now they're selling your games and you have to work in that margin for them

842
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:36,170
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot being sold at retail anymore.

843
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,511
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly...

844
01:05:38,700 --> 01:06:03,418
[SPEAKER_07]: you know I think and this is probably that the reality is at the end of the day this is not a conversation that's our business and we just have to accept that in gaming we want everything to be our business but it's not always but it's all about me I know it's the games that I want just the early access the special edition versions of the game 2.2 million sold at $100 each oof

845
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:16,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's $220 million Here's the rest of my thought And they're spending $6 million on the players?

846
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:25,880
[SPEAKER_07]: The players and their agents should have an understanding of the math that we are trying to figure out live on the spot.

847
01:06:26,241 --> 01:06:30,384
[SPEAKER_07]: The players and their agents should have an understanding of what percentage does this boil down to.

848
01:06:30,744 --> 01:06:34,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that's why it went up from 600 to 1500 was through those conversations.

849
01:06:35,027 --> 01:06:42,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think at the end of the day, that's one of those... This is a conversation we're just not invited to the table for as much as we want gaming to center around us.

850
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:43,554
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what it is.

851
01:06:43,594 --> 01:06:47,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's before you even consider Ultimate Team because Ultimate Team is...

852
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:55,965
[SPEAKER_01]: A major part of the pack-in bonuses with the Deluxe Edition, which sold 2.2 million copies.

853
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they can afford to pay them at least 10 times what they're paying them now.

854
01:07:03,573 --> 01:07:04,573
[SPEAKER_01]: They could afford that.

855
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:05,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy.

856
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:10,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We could talk much more about this, but the reality is we're not at the negotiating table.

857
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:15,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't be afraid to negotiate, agents, folks, if you don't sign it.

858
01:07:15,981 --> 01:07:17,743
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't like it, don't put a ring on it.

859
01:07:18,323 --> 01:07:19,604
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

860
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:21,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about this.

861
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:22,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is interesting.

862
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:24,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Another sequel coming out of Atari.

863
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:30,796
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know how they did like a Yars Revenge sort of reimagining and it really had very little to do with Yars Revenge.

864
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:34,900
[SPEAKER_07]: They kind of turned it into a Metroidvania type of game that had Yars Revenge elements in it.

865
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:35,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair...

866
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:39,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I never got around to playing it, so I can't tell you if it's good or bad.

867
01:07:39,963 --> 01:07:47,846
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently it was good enough for Atari and Mighty Yell and 13AM Games to come together to make Missile Command Delta.

868
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:54,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It is now a turn-based tactical game that will be out on PS5, Switch, and PC.

869
01:07:54,808 --> 01:08:00,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Very little of the game could I get a sense of from the announcement trailer because it looked like a bunch of 3D stuff.

870
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, are they turning it into a 3D game?

871
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,751
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you can see, just barely...

872
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:10,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Some screenshots in the game I'm trying to see if I can like If you squint really hard?

873
01:08:10,517 --> 01:08:27,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, basically Like you can see Well, alright, I'm gonna do this For those that are watching live I will run the trailer here And I'll try to get the parts that actually show what the game looks like here

874
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:32,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think right in here.

875
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dang it.

876
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:34,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That part here.

877
01:08:34,596 --> 01:08:34,956
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

878
01:08:35,056 --> 01:08:39,939
[SPEAKER_07]: This part looks like the more tactical part where you have like the big board with the hexagons.

879
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Dang it.

880
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:45,561
[SPEAKER_07]: See, they show they show so little of it in the trailer that it's hard to get a sense of the actual game is.

881
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:49,103
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think you see I think you see a glimpse of it here, too.

882
01:08:50,764 --> 01:08:55,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, it's like a more like tactical, puzzly type of game here.

883
01:08:57,588 --> 01:08:58,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it could be interesting.

884
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

885
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I appreciate that it's not just another fucking reboot of the same game we've been playing for literally 40 plus years.

886
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they're trying something different with it.

887
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:10,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it works out.

888
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Tigerclaw says, I wonder if Mr. Awesome will play it.

889
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:15,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably not.

890
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:20,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I... I'm exhausted just thinking about that conversation.

891
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,234
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, moving on.

892
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:28,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to a simpler time with this next segment.

893
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,938
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to roll the bumper right now.

894
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:47,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

895
01:09:48,254 --> 01:09:50,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

896
01:09:52,308 --> 01:10:01,392
[SPEAKER_07]: This is quite the classic tonight that DarkSakura has picked for us because I know some people that would say this is the best video game ever made.

897
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I know more than one person that would say this is the best video game ever made.

898
01:10:05,793 --> 01:10:08,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's about time that I did it because it hit the point.

899
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:12,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally hit that point well enough.

900
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow.

901
01:10:16,618 --> 01:10:22,402
[SPEAKER_07]: That point being 10 years or older is what qualifies the game as classic game of the week.

902
01:10:22,682 --> 01:10:24,943
[SPEAKER_07]: But Jamie's allowed to bend the rules whenever she wants.

903
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:25,744
[SPEAKER_07]: It's her segment.

904
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:32,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So if she's early by a day, and I think when you hear what this game is, you're going to say, oh yeah, we can bend the rules for this one.

905
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:34,209
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bloodborne.

906
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've already done both of those, you guys.

907
01:10:38,932 --> 01:10:41,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even did Halo, Bobby, because I got paid to.

908
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:42,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

909
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:50,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloodborne, a game that came out on March 24th, 2015 in North America.

910
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,184
[SPEAKER_04]: PAL regions March 25th, Japan March 26th, UK March 27th.

911
01:10:56,265 --> 01:11:03,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an action roleplay game that was developed by From Software, published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4.

912
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:15,488
[SPEAKER_04]: You follow a hunter through this city called Yharnam, where the inhabitants have this blood-borne disease that turned them into beasts.

913
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:20,035
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to find the source of the plague and unravel the mysteries behind it.

914
01:11:21,116 --> 01:11:50,013
[SPEAKER_04]: um there you go uh it is a third person perspective you control your protagonist and you run around and you fight shit um it has a lot of similarities to Dark Souls has lots of influences by Lovecraft and Bram Stoker and uh some this part that I think is cool it includes a lot of homages to the architectural design of Romania and the Czech Republic so I think that that's cool um

915
01:11:51,283 --> 01:11:55,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been, as some say, among the greatest video games ever made.

916
01:11:57,348 --> 01:12:03,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Praised for its atmosphere, art direction, sound design, the themes, gameplay, you name it.

917
01:12:05,715 --> 01:12:11,780
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some criticism when it first launched, but there have been post-release updates that made it better.

918
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,723
[SPEAKER_04]: There's DLC called The Old Hunters, released November 2015.

919
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:43,622
[SPEAKER_04]: the game has sold 7.46 million copies by February 2022 and there's all kinds of other stuff out for it as well so basically you play your hunter character and you go around fighting people, bosses and interacting with items and hanging out with NPCs and doing just all kinds of stuff that FromSoftware games are pretty much known for

920
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:52,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So you also can return to your little hub world called the Hunter's Dream by talking to lanterns or interacting with them.

921
01:12:53,877 --> 01:13:00,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And it fills up your health, but it respawns every enemy you just fought except for bosses and mini-bosses.

922
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:09,101
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also got pretty big maps and all kinds of little hidden stuff that you can find.

923
01:13:10,822 --> 01:13:39,022
[SPEAKER_04]: and you also have shortcuts everywhere different places to explore but one of the other things too is that you are rewarded for higher risks so like for example if you you know you'll get health potions better health potions if you strike an enemy in like a more riskier move for example you also have a new game plus which is also good

924
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:59,160
[SPEAKER_04]: you get Molotov cocktails, you can blow shit up you also get Blood Echoes where it works as experience points in currency and if you die you lose what you have but it drops where you left off hidden items, that kind of things it has a multiplayer mode

925
01:14:01,122 --> 01:14:27,056
[SPEAKER_04]: it is you basically activate this item and suspend an insight point and you can summon other players into your world to play with you but it does leave you open to invasions so other players can go into your your world and kill you so there's that there are chalice dungeons which are special dungeons that become available through using different items and materials um

926
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really a lot going on with this game, way too much for me to go into super detail about.

927
01:14:34,397 --> 01:14:49,821
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, Japan Studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment, reached out to From Software to work together on a game, and Miyazaki Hidetaka...

928
01:14:51,681 --> 01:14:56,884
[SPEAKER_04]: who was the director, asked about doing something for the 8th generation consoles.

929
01:14:57,084 --> 01:14:59,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Bloodborne came up around there.

930
01:15:00,886 --> 01:15:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It was something disconnected from the Dark Souls franchise, but of course it's from software.

931
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,551
[SPEAKER_04]: It was going to be similar.

932
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:17,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were predominantly inspired by Dracula, which features many locations in Romania and Chechnya.

933
01:15:19,173 --> 01:15:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there was nods to the Cthulhu mythos.

934
01:15:23,334 --> 01:15:26,134
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all kinds of goodies in there if you're a fan.

935
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on to the release information.

936
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:32,535
[SPEAKER_04]: It was...

937
01:15:36,206 --> 01:15:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

938
01:16:01,205 --> 01:16:07,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, you know, I gave the release dates already, but there was the DLC, The Old Hunters, that came out November 24th, 2015.

939
01:16:08,512 --> 01:16:13,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a place in a world where hunters of the past are trapped.

940
01:16:13,957 --> 01:16:16,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get new stuff, new outfits and stuff.

941
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there was a limited edition collector's pack.

942
01:16:20,563 --> 01:16:25,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It had a steelbook case, a hardcover art book, a digital copy of the cell track.

943
01:16:26,486 --> 01:16:37,798
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sail Trek was released separately on April 21st, 2015, and the European exclusive had physical items like a quill and ink set, and all of the items in the standard collector's edition.

944
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:44,905
[SPEAKER_04]: The Asian edition had a letter opener that was modeled off the in-game weapon, the Kirkhammer PS4 bundle.

945
01:16:45,626 --> 01:16:47,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also available.

946
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:56,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a song that was recorded by a hit house featuring Ruby Friedman for a trailer in the TV spot.

947
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:01,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went all out basically for this.

948
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:05,889
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, Sony Denmark teamed up with Give Blood to encourage blood donations.

949
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:14,836
[SPEAKER_04]: and anyone who donated on March 23, 2015 got a chance to win the game as a gift.

950
01:17:16,237 --> 01:17:22,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a licensed card game that was based off of the in-game Chalice Dungeons.

951
01:17:23,763 --> 01:17:24,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out November 2016.

952
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,945
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a comic tie-in.

953
01:17:26,985 --> 01:17:28,106
[SPEAKER_04]: All kinds of stuff happened.

954
01:17:28,646 --> 01:17:32,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was received very, very well.

955
01:17:32,449 --> 01:17:33,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Its Metacritic score is 92%.

956
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Edge gave it 10 out of 10.

957
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,652
[SPEAKER_04]: EGM, 9.5 out of 10.

958
01:17:38,932 --> 01:17:39,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Informer, 9 out of 10.

959
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:42,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it did really, really, really well.

960
01:17:44,874 --> 01:17:49,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It also, for 2015, it won Best Original Game for Golden Joystick.

961
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:51,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nominated, though, for a lot of other stuff.

962
01:17:52,016 --> 01:17:53,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And it did get PlayStation Game of the Year.

963
01:17:55,517 --> 01:18:02,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It also won the 12th British Academy Games Award for Game Design.

964
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And there you go.

965
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:04,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloodborne.

966
01:18:06,257 --> 01:18:07,637
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

967
01:18:22,082 --> 01:18:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: People, when it comes to games, feel completely differently as well.

968
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:27,366
[SPEAKER_07]: They like that it is so difficult.

969
01:18:27,406 --> 01:18:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: They like the challenge.

970
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:36,492
[SPEAKER_07]: They like very little to guide you with the game and the sense of exploration and discovery that that gives.

971
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sometimes funny to see the most extreme way you could die.

972
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:41,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

973
01:18:41,395 --> 01:18:44,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But I recognize why this game is as loved as it is.

974
01:18:44,777 --> 01:18:47,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It's certainly beautiful to look at, especially for its time.

975
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:48,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

976
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you kind of said it all otherwise.

977
01:18:50,881 --> 01:18:51,842
[SPEAKER_04]: For its time, Rob.

978
01:18:53,543 --> 01:19:19,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it's not that old I know but just there's still tons of stuff on PS4 that look pretty modern Questmaster in chat says word is that the reason there hasn't been a remake which many fans have been clamoring and modding for years is that Hidetaka is too busy to do it himself and won't let it go to anyone else I believe that

979
01:19:20,968 --> 01:19:22,969
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Bloodborne.

980
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you that were asking, when?

981
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:27,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Bloodborne, when?

982
01:19:27,092 --> 01:19:27,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you go.

983
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:28,072
[SPEAKER_07]: There's your answer.

984
01:19:28,112 --> 01:19:28,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that it's 10 years old.

985
01:19:30,234 --> 01:19:36,637
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on and check out some other headlines from the week rapidly in some rapid-fire news.

986
01:19:36,757 --> 01:19:37,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

987
01:19:38,699 --> 01:19:40,239
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what this is at all.

988
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:43,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you would do this.

989
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:51,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I assume they want to make money off the meme, but Big Rigs Over the Road Racing is now coming to Steam.

990
01:19:51,969 --> 01:20:07,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know what Big Rigs Over the Road Racing is, it is an absolute terrible game about racing big rigs that it was completely unfinished and released retail, has no collision effect, you know, no very minimal physics.

991
01:20:07,455 --> 01:20:08,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is just broken.

992
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:31,733
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no real word on if any of that stuff's gonna be fixed or if it's just gonna be a port of the game now running on Steam so I guess we'll find out yay um congrats to all the fans that are gonna buy this game they get a lot cited gold star that says your did it

993
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: S.J.

994
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:34,381
[SPEAKER_07]: and Hunter Mattis probably on the right track.

995
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:38,306
[SPEAKER_07]: The rights were probably cheap and might try to cash in on the terribleness.

996
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:38,306
100%.

997
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:43,373
[SPEAKER_07]: 100%.

998
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:43,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, Showgirls gets re-released on Blu-ray every other year for a reason.

999
01:20:44,735 --> 01:20:44,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1000
01:20:45,749 --> 01:20:49,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, this is kind of funny, but it's the times we live in.

1001
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:56,877
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody remembers those old scholastic book fairs, you know, where you get all the different books and stuff.

1002
01:20:56,897 --> 01:20:58,798
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, like, cordon off a classroom.

1003
01:20:58,818 --> 01:21:00,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That was, like, the highlight of the year.

1004
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:04,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they always have, like, weird, like, video game things in there.

1005
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:07,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they used to be, like, cheat guides and stuff like that.

1006
01:21:07,164 --> 01:21:09,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta get those tickets to Great America by selling a million books.

1007
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:14,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now is the time to capitalize on the popular...

1008
01:21:15,808 --> 01:21:18,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Internet Culture, and put it into a book.

1009
01:21:19,031 --> 01:21:27,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And none other than Scholastic themselves has announced that they plan to print books and graphic novels based on Skibbity Toilet.

1010
01:21:28,019 --> 01:21:28,900
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1011
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Your favorite... How the mighty have fallen.

1012
01:21:31,823 --> 01:21:39,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Your favorite Garry's Mod imagery coming to a Scholastic Golden Book soon.

1013
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:41,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh boy.

1014
01:21:42,138 --> 01:21:43,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go cry in the corner.

1015
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:47,127
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Whitney Houston once said, I believe that children are the future.

1016
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:50,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she passed away.

1017
01:21:50,453 --> 01:21:52,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And now clearly nobody believes that anymore.

1018
01:21:53,055 --> 01:21:54,096
[SPEAKER_01]: and Converse Classic.

1019
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:59,539
[SPEAKER_01]: We're beyond thrilled to be the publishing partner for one of the most groundbreaking and unique properties of our time.

1020
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:01,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's not groundbreaking.

1021
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:01,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

1022
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Brain-breaking, but not groundbreaking.

1023
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:05,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's reel it in.

1024
01:22:06,203 --> 01:22:07,424
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not groundbreaking.

1025
01:22:07,564 --> 01:22:08,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just weird.

1026
01:22:09,185 --> 01:22:12,907
[SPEAKER_01]: A truly cultural phenomenon that resonates with readers of all ages.

1027
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:16,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I beg to disagree there, but okay.

1028
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just... We'll see.

1029
01:22:18,671 --> 01:22:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to know what my brain heard, by the way.

1030
01:22:24,893 --> 01:22:28,997
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1031
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I mean, definitely has potential to be, wouldn't you think?

1032
01:22:47,954 --> 01:22:56,702
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a sequel to Super Dodgeball, Double Dragon Dodgeball by Arc Systems.

1033
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:03,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has 56 characters from Double Dragon who will play dodgeball against each other.

1034
01:23:04,034 --> 01:23:12,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be released for PS5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC via Steam on October 23rd.

1035
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:13,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks fun.

1036
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:18,322
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a story mode, which is like the classic Marion Rescue story.

1037
01:23:18,402 --> 01:23:21,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think by now she would just start packing heat with her.

1038
01:23:23,245 --> 01:23:25,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Two player versus mode and a survival mode.

1039
01:23:27,328 --> 01:23:27,688
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1040
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:28,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds fun.

1041
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:31,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd check that out for sure.

1042
01:23:32,233 --> 01:23:37,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Music game fans, I know you're out there and there's a new release for you because guess who's involved with this?

1043
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:38,335

[SPEAKER_07]: That's a horse racing series.

1074
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:20,034

1075
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happens when they get to the next game?

1076
01:27:21,996 --> 01:27:22,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be winning 11-11.

1077
01:27:23,877 --> 01:27:24,257
[SPEAKER_07]: at some point.

1078
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:28,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Winning Post 10 is out on the Switch this week.

1079
01:27:28,301 --> 01:27:29,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is a U.S.

1080
01:27:29,442 --> 01:27:35,907
[SPEAKER_07]: date, but I just want to call it out because I feel like we see these all the time in Japan, these Kemco RPG collections.

1081
01:27:37,248 --> 01:27:38,790
[SPEAKER_07]: They are releasing one in the U.S.

1082
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:41,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Volume 1 comes to the U.S.

1083
01:27:41,452 --> 01:27:43,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, there's like 13 of these in Japan.

1084
01:27:43,934 --> 01:27:46,556
[SPEAKER_07]: But Volume 1, finally on the Switch in the U.S.

1085
01:27:46,716 --> 01:27:47,157
[SPEAKER_07]: next week.

1086
01:27:47,977 --> 01:27:50,720
[SPEAKER_07]: As Divine Hearts, Revenant Saga, Antiqua Lost...

1087
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Antiqua Lost and Dragon Sinker.

1088
01:27:53,981 --> 01:28:08,067
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think it made our show role, but I think possibly timed for this, some classic Super Nintendo strategy games like Nobunaga's Ambition, which actually was a remake on Super Nintendo in itself because the original original was on Nintendo.

1089
01:28:08,987 --> 01:28:11,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Games in that series are making their way to Switch Online.

1090
01:28:11,969 --> 01:28:14,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of interesting.

1091
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:14,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway...

1092
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:19,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, other releases actually for Japan this week.

1093
01:28:19,352 --> 01:28:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Setsuna ni Kakeru ko Hanabi comes out this week as well on the Switch.

1094
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:31,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And, oh, here we go, Kemco RPG Selection Volume 9.

1095
01:28:32,138 --> 01:28:34,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were further along than 9, but they have 9.

1096
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So, As Divine Saga, Ghost Sinks, Sword of Elphesia...

1097
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:38,620
[SPEAKER_07]: and Ambition Record.

1098
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so interesting.

1099
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,241
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some crossover there.

1100
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:43,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have thought maybe we got games that kind of matched the first one, but no.

1101
01:28:43,662 --> 01:28:45,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So Volume 9, that's what it looks like in Japan.

1102
01:28:46,762 --> 01:28:51,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Sanrio Characters Miracle Match is out in Japan as well this week.

1103
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:52,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1104
01:28:52,804 --> 01:28:53,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

1105
01:28:53,364 --> 01:28:54,744
[SPEAKER_07]: We needed another Hello Kitty game.

1106
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as there's lots of little twin stars, I'm happy.

1107
01:28:59,085 --> 01:29:01,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And a game called Go Hell Go.

1108
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:04,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Oh Hell No, but Go Hell Go.

1109
01:29:04,927 --> 01:29:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Suki Oto...

1110
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:08,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Yoshite Ko comes out as well.

1111
01:29:08,929 --> 01:29:14,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I'm going to say, I'm going to, I don't even, can I even show this screenshot on our Twitch show?

1112
01:29:14,352 --> 01:29:15,173
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show it fast.

1113
01:29:15,193 --> 01:29:16,033
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show it fast.

1114
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:23,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's safe for this website and everything's covered, but this screenshot should give you an example of what to expect in this game.

1115
01:29:23,338 --> 01:29:24,518
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I'm going to say.

1116
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:25,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1117
01:29:29,422 --> 01:29:29,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1118
01:29:30,382 --> 01:29:31,083
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1119
01:29:33,084 --> 01:29:33,204
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1120
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:37,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean... And the chat goes mild.

1121
01:29:38,697 --> 01:29:40,538
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of silence and what?

1122
01:29:40,978 --> 01:29:43,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the chat comments can be summed up as what?

1123
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:46,779
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the PlayStation 5?

1124
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:55,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, maybe you prefer your exploitation a little more classic and you want Dead or Alive Extreme Venus Vacation Prism.

1125
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:58,703
[SPEAKER_07]: That is out on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan.

1126
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:00,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Venus Vacation Prism.

1127
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,224
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the name of the game.

1128
01:30:02,324 --> 01:30:02,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I stutter?

1129
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:13,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The graphics are really good, and the bra sizes, very big numbers, apparently.

1130
01:30:13,984 --> 01:30:14,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1131
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:16,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I keep thinking?

1132
01:30:17,406 --> 01:30:17,526
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1133
01:30:17,546 --> 01:30:18,547
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I keep thinking?

1134
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:20,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow?

1135
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:21,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Her poor back.

1136
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:22,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1137
01:30:23,009 --> 01:30:23,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Her poor back.

1138
01:30:26,307 --> 01:30:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the UK?

1139
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:32,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Take us to the classic kingdom, DarkSakura.

1140
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:35,852

1160
01:32:35,214 --> 01:32:40,316
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Ranma's at a con this weekend, actually, because he was texting me pictures of somebody cosplaying Columbia for the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1161
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure they'll be talking all about that.

1162
01:32:42,877 --> 01:33:10,203
[SPEAKER_07]: British Invaders as well still going strong all these years later they've been on damn near as long as we have they've been going a long time talking about classic and modern British television check out some of our shows there and of course the one and only Bobby Blackwolf but he gets a plug every week at the beginning of the show I just want to mention those shows as well all of us collaborate over at the Voice Geeks Network Discord server vognetwork.com we heart Bobby here slash Discord of course we do we read his comments and chat throughout the night as well

1163
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:14,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, but let's get to this news story, Loki.

1164
01:33:15,918 --> 01:33:25,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so apparently there's some stuff being teased on social media coming from none other than Game Informer.

1165
01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:25,948
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

1166
01:33:26,008 --> 01:33:36,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently it says, you know, they're going to make a, there's a video that they have called Continue, and it basically teases something being announced on the 25th.

1167
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:48,543
[SPEAKER_01]: and apparently there are staff from the previous Game Informer that have been also sharing this and it sounds like they're going to be involved.

1168
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:48,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1169
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:50,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's coming back.

1170
01:33:50,804 --> 01:33:52,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody scooped up the rights at a bargain basement price.

1171
01:33:52,864 --> 01:33:53,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Good for them.

1172
01:33:53,785 --> 01:33:55,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited to see what happens.

1173
01:33:55,205 --> 01:33:56,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Is ketchup going to be doing it?

1174
01:33:56,626 --> 01:33:58,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Is ketchup going to save everything?

1175
01:33:58,146 --> 01:33:58,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.

1176
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:01,507
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a new company called Mustard.

1177
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:02,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Mustard.

1178
01:34:03,728 --> 01:34:04,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jesus.

1179
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:06,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried.

1180
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:06,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1181
01:34:06,799 --> 01:34:07,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

1182
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:07,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, everybody.

1183
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:08,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going home.

1184
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,381
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1185
01:34:09,961 --> 01:34:10,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We're home, Rob.

1186
01:34:10,842 --> 01:34:13,784
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell me to go home in this next segment, our Lister Roundtable.

1187
01:34:13,804 --> 01:34:16,906
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to give us a call, vognetwork.com slash discord.

1188
01:34:16,926 --> 01:34:20,429
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys have any random questions for us in chat, we welcome those as well.

1189
01:34:21,029 --> 01:34:22,690
[SPEAKER_07]: You also can send us emails every week.

1190
01:34:23,031 --> 01:34:25,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Participate at orangelauntrader.com.

1191
01:34:25,312 --> 01:34:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I went in there a couple hours ago, there was nothing I saw.

1192
01:34:28,395 --> 01:34:29,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a desert.

1193
01:34:29,275 --> 01:34:29,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

1194
01:34:29,996 --> 01:34:32,618
[SPEAKER_04]: With space balls combing it.

1195
01:34:32,718 --> 01:34:33,919
[SPEAKER_07]: There was at least 13 space balls.

1196
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuvok going, we ain't found shit.

1197
01:34:37,781 --> 01:34:40,942
[SPEAKER_07]: There was 13 spam emails in there from one week.

1198
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:42,283
[SPEAKER_07]: One week.

1199
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:49,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And clearly the mistake I made was putting this show on YouTube because all of the spam is about increasing your YouTube views.

1200
01:34:50,672 --> 01:34:51,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of annoying.

1201
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: All we need to do is go in and hit the unsubscribe on some of those.

1202
01:34:58,161 --> 01:35:00,724
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why I don't like doing that?

1203
01:35:00,884 --> 01:35:02,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an honest reason why I don't like doing that.

1204
01:35:02,886 --> 01:35:05,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it tells them that you read it and that the email is valid.

1205
01:35:05,889 --> 01:35:08,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't trust that that works.

1206
01:35:08,352 --> 01:35:10,635
[SPEAKER_04]: But they still have to take you off.

1207
01:35:10,855 --> 01:35:11,376
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to.

1208
01:35:13,597 --> 01:35:14,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Consider me skeptic.

1209
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:14,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1210
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no.

1211
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

1212
01:35:18,564 --> 01:35:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that is the way the law is written.

1213
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1214
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,652
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also redirects.

1215
01:35:25,074 --> 01:35:25,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1216
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:27,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Spam of the week.

1217
01:35:27,767 --> 01:35:27,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1218
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:51,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not giving that any freaking attention.

1219
01:35:51,732 --> 01:35:52,333
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we are not.

1220
01:35:52,393 --> 01:35:53,033
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we are not.

1221
01:35:53,854 --> 01:35:58,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Fuck a bunch of that on a pogo stick.

1222
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. T in chat says, I wanted to shout out MulletMadJack on Game Pass.

1223
01:36:04,953 --> 01:36:08,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Pass has a lot of neat little indie and titles you might miss if you're not paying attention.

1224
01:36:09,554 --> 01:36:14,536
[SPEAKER_07]: A Doom-style roguelike with a 90s anime aesthetic.

1225
01:36:14,816 --> 01:36:16,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Misha and I are both hooked.

1226
01:36:17,537 --> 01:36:21,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkTest Studio says, I do try to send in Blue Sky stuff, but we've been super busy IRL.

1227
01:36:21,598 --> 01:36:22,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I would have.

1228
01:36:22,378 --> 01:36:23,239
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to apologize.

1229
01:36:23,579 --> 01:36:27,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, I'm very bad at â€“ well, I do â€“ I check Blue Sky throughout the week.

1230
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,461
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1231
01:36:42,995 --> 01:36:51,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we just need like a dedicated... Because I like the fact that there's a channel for Orange Launch Radio where people can post the news and sometimes discuss the news.

1232
01:36:51,857 --> 01:36:55,318
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wish there was a place that was like just questions and feedback or something.

1233
01:36:55,378 --> 01:36:55,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1234
01:36:55,798 --> 01:36:57,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to figure that out.

1235
01:36:57,658 --> 01:37:00,179
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know Discord is a big thing these days now.

1236
01:37:01,559 --> 01:37:02,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I will check that game out, Mish.

1237
01:37:02,979 --> 01:37:05,880
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's on Game Pass, hey, I'm all for checking it out.

1238
01:37:06,514 --> 01:37:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's in my library.

1239
01:37:08,036 --> 01:37:10,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jamie got it for me for Christmas.

1240
01:37:11,038 --> 01:37:12,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love that.

1241
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:12,920
[SPEAKER_01]: When did I get you?

1242
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Mullet Mad Jack.

1243
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:15,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1244
01:37:15,783 --> 01:37:17,404
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw that, I was like, I have to get that for you.

1245
01:37:18,105 --> 01:37:20,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's on there.

1246
01:37:21,308 --> 01:37:24,631
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that are in my library that I need to play.

1247
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:24,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

1248
01:37:25,948 --> 01:37:32,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, OrangeRite in chat says, I did tell someone making a podcast starter pack on Blue Sky about Orange Lounge Radio.

1249
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:34,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it wasn't my fault.

1250
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:35,672
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I did wonder.

1251
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:39,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We got like 25 new follows on Blue Sky, which is a lot for us.

1252
01:37:39,473 --> 01:37:41,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, where did all these people come from?

1253
01:37:42,634 --> 01:37:43,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was wondering about that.

1254
01:37:43,955 --> 01:37:44,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi all of those people.

1255
01:37:45,035 --> 01:37:47,056
[SPEAKER_07]: No, hi to any new listeners potentially.

1256
01:37:47,116 --> 01:37:48,276
[SPEAKER_07]: No, OrangeRite, you're fine.

1257
01:37:48,336 --> 01:37:48,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not your fault.

1258
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:54,219
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the... I can tell you right now, all the spam email we're getting is, you're not getting enough YouTube viewers.

1259
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how to get more YouTube viewers.

1260
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Your podcast isn't getting enough viewers.

1261
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us help inflate your... It's all that shit.

1262
01:38:00,401 --> 01:38:06,764
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know it's because we made the mistake of putting our email address on... Well, which is through the RSS feed.

1263
01:38:06,804 --> 01:38:08,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not really... It's on YouTube.

1264
01:38:08,965 --> 01:38:09,425
[SPEAKER_07]: And people...

1265
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:30,552
[SPEAKER_07]: people scrape YouTube for all of that stuff for to send those sorts of emails so yeah no but thank you Orange right now that that answers that question I had I wondered why we got like a sudden influx of followers on Blue Sky I was like so somebody put us in a starter pack well that's really nice thank you we're not arguing with any of that

1266
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,621
[SPEAKER_07]: SHO and Hunter Matt says, need more cat photos.

1267
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:36,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby drops a cat photo and gets hundreds of likes.

1268
01:38:36,842 --> 01:38:37,723
[SPEAKER_07]: No, for real.

1269
01:38:38,063 --> 01:38:38,483
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

1270
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:41,845
[SPEAKER_07]: My cat photos get more traction than anything else on Blue Sky, which is fine.

1271
01:38:42,105 --> 01:38:44,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheddar's the most adorable kitty.

1272
01:38:44,706 --> 01:38:51,049
[SPEAKER_07]: As Alan puts it, the cat with permanent eyeliner.

1273
01:38:51,289 --> 01:38:55,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he has these black lines that go from his eyes that make it look like he has permanent wings.

1274
01:38:56,392 --> 01:38:56,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Makeup.

1275
01:38:57,032 --> 01:38:57,432
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

1276
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Cheddar.

1277
01:38:59,153 --> 01:39:00,354
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is my Midna.

1278
01:39:01,034 --> 01:39:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

1279
01:39:04,509 --> 01:39:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: All I will say is we're considering that.

1280
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:18,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Alan is being courted by the adoption agency for a second cat that they think would be good.

1281
01:39:19,114 --> 01:39:19,934
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1282
01:39:19,974 --> 01:39:21,295
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm open to it, of course.

1283
01:39:21,495 --> 01:39:22,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I love kitties.

1284
01:39:23,195 --> 01:39:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they the kind that let you do the trial?

1285
01:39:26,386 --> 01:39:26,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1286
01:39:26,866 --> 01:39:30,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they really want you to try to make it work like anybody would.

1287
01:39:30,689 --> 01:39:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, if for whatever reason the cats were to hate each other, they would always take them back.

1288
01:39:37,435 --> 01:39:37,855
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1289
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:39,777
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1290
01:39:40,037 --> 01:39:42,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Loki, let me check in with you and see if you have any last minute stories for us tonight.

1291
01:39:43,676 --> 01:39:44,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not.

1292
01:39:45,037 --> 01:39:51,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to mention, though, coinciding with the Minecraft movie, they're going to be doing tie-ins with McDonald's.

1293
01:39:52,504 --> 01:40:01,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had some really creepy Minecraft... So you know how the Minecraft movie visuals are already kind of like, uh, kind of creepy?

1294
01:40:01,752 --> 01:40:04,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you put McDonald's characters in that style?

1295
01:40:06,216 --> 01:40:06,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew.

1296
01:40:07,217 --> 01:40:07,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

1297
01:40:09,013 --> 01:40:10,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the hot Hamburglar?

1298
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:10,314
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1299
01:40:12,635 --> 01:40:12,935
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1300
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:13,375
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1301
01:40:13,756 --> 01:40:16,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there... Oh, you mean like from the Japanese commercials?

1302
01:40:16,397 --> 01:40:23,441
[SPEAKER_07]: No, in like 2006, so that was like 20 years ago, they tried to reboot the Hamburglar for McDonald's and they made the hot Hamburglar.

1303
01:40:25,042 --> 01:40:25,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember that.

1304
01:40:26,042 --> 01:40:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have just forced that out of my memory.

1305
01:40:30,404 --> 01:40:30,865
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let me see.

1306
01:40:31,105 --> 01:40:32,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting it up right now on the other screen.

1307
01:40:33,006 --> 01:40:33,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, Rob.

1308
01:40:34,727 --> 01:40:36,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now I want to share with the listeners.

1309
01:40:39,017 --> 01:40:40,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Grimace could be a character.

1310
01:40:40,698 --> 01:40:44,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So see, there's the... How do I get this big?

1311
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:48,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Grimace is the face that you make an hour after eating McDonald's.

1312
01:40:51,685 --> 01:40:52,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Aptly named.

1313
01:40:54,967 --> 01:40:58,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, if that's it for the stories then...

1314
01:41:00,726 --> 01:41:28,469
[SPEAKER_07]: S200 Matt says Ben Star no but he did have that new commercial for Square Enix in the last week that was like I heard you might be looking for some new games to play and of course the answer is always Final Fantasy 8 but bearing that it's very his style is great anyway I picked up Final Fantasy 6 in that I didn't want to pick up all the Final Fantasy games because I was like I probably won't play them but

1315
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:30,341
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1316
01:41:47,183 --> 01:42:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, well, at least for a little while, my work schedule has me needing to get there at 6 in the morning And I have to be in office so I won't have my usual wake up time But I'll see how it goes after I'm back to my hybrid schedule where I can work at home on Monday And we'll see, but for right now I would not be at all able to do the thing

1317
01:42:12,486 --> 01:42:15,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't, I can't brain, words are hard Can't even No, words are hard

1318
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:41,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I forget to say it, thank you, of course, for listening to Orange Launch Radio and supporting us.

1319
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:45,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but if you want more voices to put out on air, tell a friend or two about the show.

1320
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:46,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us spread the word.

1321
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:58,063
[SPEAKER_07]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or excuse me, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or I guess YouTube, even if it's going to invite spam, but show those spammers we don't need them.

1322
01:42:58,983 --> 01:43:01,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That goes an awful long way, so thank you very much for all that support.

1323
01:43:01,863 --> 01:43:02,524
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

1324
01:43:03,364 --> 01:43:04,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

1325
01:43:06,108 --> 01:43:10,850
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I got surprised with the mail that I get jury duty.

1326
01:43:11,631 --> 01:43:12,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1327
01:43:12,871 --> 01:43:13,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1328
01:43:13,191 --> 01:43:14,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And the crowd hates it.

1329
01:43:14,892 --> 01:43:15,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1330
01:43:17,185 --> 01:43:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to read a book.

1331
01:43:18,186 --> 01:43:19,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, hopefully it's a short trial.

1332
01:43:20,827 --> 01:43:24,689
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I have a three-day weekend next weekend.

1333
01:43:24,909 --> 01:43:27,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very delightful surprise three-day weekend.

1334
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:30,731
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a state holiday, not a federal holiday, but I have it off, so I'm like, yay.

1335
01:43:31,532 --> 01:43:32,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray surprise holidays.

1336
01:43:32,772 --> 01:43:33,973
[SPEAKER_07]: We love surprise holidays.

1337
01:43:34,493 --> 01:43:35,694
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll be back.

1338
01:43:36,354 --> 01:43:39,137
[SPEAKER_07]: in seven days to do it all again on another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
