10256	11596	The news this week is full of trends.
11796	13037	New releases this year.
13117	14637	Continued cuts and industry shrinking.
14977	17198	The strike goes on, but we commit to opportunity.
17378	19519	And also returning the spotlight to Warner Bros.
19539	22920	continuing to kill the opportunity to make money and continuing to fail to launch.
23120	24840	It's a mixed bag, but at least it's news.
25080	27401	Don't believe everything you read, especially not after this show.
27601	30082	The April Fools will come out attempting to make fools of us all.
30162	31462	This is the last gasp of March.
31622	35843	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this week's gaming news.
36063	38124	Starting right now on the show, every gamer has voice...
39861	42662	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42722	46484	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46564	56669	It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, episode number 1040 for March the 30th of 2025.
56829	63712	So yes, as Jason pointed out in the intro there, be wary of April Fool's jokes coming up this week, but none on tonight's show.
63752	65853	We're in the clear for that, but I think we all know
66593	78560	Little pranksters love to prank and come out with fake news things on April 1st, which I legitimately think is why Nintendo is doing a direct on April 2nd, just to steer the boat clear of any of that shenanigans.
78580	82383	That's also why Behaviour's doing their announcements on the 2nd as well.
82583	84524	Well, hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
84564	84764	Hi.
85024	91248	And yes, so not the only company doing announcements on April 2nd, purposefully steering clear of the 1st.
91488	92189	Yeah, makes sense.
92925	118844	and which is uh wise yes is that like not even a real holiday knock it off people is April 2nd when they're going to patch in that manga killer they announced recently they're doing a live and then it's typically right after they do those the live uh sorry that the actual thing goes live gotcha okay interesting uh also say hello to the one and only tech master Loki hello hi how are you Loki
119912	120753	Everyone can play in that
138018	138959	Yes, it's the new hottest right now.
139580	141642	Oh yes, I have seen a lot of streamers.
141682	144025	I feel like I've been out of the loop on Twitch culture a little bit.
144066	147170	I mean, outside this show, like I've barely watched my favorite streamers.
147230	148271	It's nothing, nothing's wrong.
148311	153678	It's just I've been oddly busy IRL, which I'm not going to complain about.
153778	155440	But yeah, so I just haven't.
156762	159724	I get the notifications and I'm always like, what is this R.E.P.O.
159784	161466	game everybody's freaking streaming?
161546	171594	It's like Lethal Company in the sense that you're going to a place and there's like monsters that you have to avoid and you have to bring back loot and stuff and try not to die and all that thing.
171614	173135	So it's like that, but it's funnier.
173616	173796	Yeah.
174868	183893	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
184613	186454	And we do have folks in our chat.
186494	188935	Thank you, Tigerclaw, linked us to buy that on the store.
189495	193877	We need to get some type of VOG Network kickback key for those links one of these days.
193917	195538	I actually don't think those exist on Steam.
196699	200581	Anyway, Questbuster says, I still miss the old Irem April Fool's jokes.
201241	201961	Oh, yes.
202401	205162	Some companies do have cute April Fool's things.
205182	207163	You just have to be in the right mindset for it, right?
207603	214585	I love stuff that's so over-the-top and ridiculous that it's obvious it's an April Fool's thing.
214825	217026	Blizzard used to do a lot of those, to be fair.
217346	230110	I don't remember what they've done the last couple years, and it's probably been toned down ever since they were in the spotlight for hella legit reasons, but they used to do some pretty over-the-top stuff that was a lot of fun, so I'll be curious if Blizzard does anything this year.
232791	237032	DarkTetsuya says there is also the should be fake but it's actually real news too.
237372	238833	Oh yes, there's that too.
239433	241674	Don't worry, we'll get that April 2nd.
242714	246195	TigerCloud pointing out there have been April Fool's jokes that become actual products.
246555	252517	Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is Google's Maps Pokemon kinda was in a way Pokemon Go.
252917	258399	Wasn't the mini fridge from Xbox, that was an April Fool's thing too, wasn't it?
261093	279849	I think it was a full-size fridge and it I mean it wasn't it was a joke but also it was a thing that they sold okay okay in limited quantities it was just like the joke would be that it's like being widely released but they did release a few okay um not a lot though it was like kind of a contest thing
280613	287039	Bobby Blackwolf says the ties I wear were the original Think Geek April Fool's gag that they turned real, the 8-bit tie.
287640	290482	Do you know what piece of nerd paraphernalia I bought this week?
292224	295167	I don't know if you heard about this whole thing at South by Southwest, but...
296768	306295	It was something, it was a shirt that Mark Zuckerberg wore that said, basically, it was like a Roman quote or something that was like trying to compare him to Caesar or something like that.
306335	314360	Like basically saying, like, you know, kind of pronouncing what a great person he is in his own mind.
315521	317462	But then the great thing was- Which Caesar?
317562	318863	One of them got stabbed in the back.
319103	319924	I know, right?
319964	323526	What was, now I'm going to, I'm going to, it's going to bug myself.
323926	324827	No, it wasn't that one.
326948	333674	See, I'm never prepared to talk about these things on air, which is why I have to research.
334474	338157	But okay, so what was it said?
339418	341160	Out Caesar, Out Neil.
341660	343241	Either Caesar or nothing.
343361	346224	But the shirt actually said Out Zuck, Out Neil.
346244	346484	Okay.
346744	350065	Mark Zuckerberg, Blue Sky, Jay Graber, Mundus Sine Caesaribus, A World Without Caesars
368336	396253	and so they actually sold replica shirts of that on Blue Sky's site and they charged a little premium for it they charged 40 bucks for it and it was $10 shipping I bought because the money is to go support Blue Sky I bought one because I'm like sure I'll support Blue Sky it's obviously that type of shade I'm gonna throw money at that that's great and yeah I wanted one and I just thought that was some world class shade going on from Blue Sky so hell yeah I bought one of those shirts
396853	399336	I didn't even know they were there.
399376	400057	I would have got one.
400457	404561	Yeah, it was announced on Blue Sky's official thing.
404582	406083	And yeah, they only sold them for a limited time.
406383	407585	But I wonder if they'll come back.
408466	409246	I wonder if they'll come back.
410267	411867	Well, the site will be worldwithoutcaesars.com Right?
438986	442069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
462286	464829	This is a huge Nintendo time of year.
465209	469834	So Loki's going to recap a somewhat surprise Nintendo Direct from this week for us.
470155	482647	I say surprise because we were only told two days beforehand, but if you believe rumors and scuttlebutt, one of the rumors out there was pegging that there was going to be a pre-Nintendo Switch 2 Direct this week.
483828	487469	And we know that the big Nintendo Switch 2 unveil official.
487570	492291	I mean, we had the little teaser, but we're going to get the official unveiling next week on the 2nd.
492751	495592	So we'll get into some of that later.
496112	503455	But first, we have the Nintendo Direct from this week, which was focusing on, I guess, the last hurrah for the original Nintendo Switch.
503515	504615	I mean, kind of.
505856	509357	Some third parties will still support it for a while, but yeah.
509477	511538	And I think a lot of the stuff that they were showing off, too...
513306	537477	is kind of similar to what we see what we've seen with a few other of kind of end of life start of a new generation type releases where you'll have games coming out on multiple platforms I think because I they showed off um one of the like the big reveals that they showed was more uh gameplay from Metroid Prime 4 and that it's going to be out this year so you would imply that it's
538337	566397	probably going to be a Switch 1 game but also I'm wondering if there's like a Switch 2 enhancements to go along with it that we'll find out you know on Tuesday here or Wednesday I guess that would be the second so yeah it's going to be interesting lots of things a lot of smaller things as well so starting off we had a Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake those are going to be coming out over here as well so that's supposed to be coming out later this year
568018	576780	Also, we have a new detective game from Konami called No Sleep for Kanamane Date.
578001	580641	And it says, From AI, The Somnium Files.
581301	582882	So many words in those titles.
583442	585483	But that is coming out July 25th.
588337	614950	Raido Remastered, The Mystery of the Soulless Army It's supposed to be a game that came out on the PlayStation 2 a long time ago And now coming out on the Switch June 19th Shadow Labyrinth, that weird game that was based off of the Amazon series for Pac-Man That is going to be coming out July 18th Oh yeah, that, I remember that
616789	619710	It's weird, but I kind of dig it.
620150	622011	I kind of like it.
622291	624372	So that'll be coming out July 18th.
626232	627433	This is kind of surprising.
627733	631494	Patapon from the PSP coming out on the Switch.
631794	635695	So they're doing remasters of Patapon 1 and 2.
636015	637556	Yeah, that was a surprise.
637756	637936	Yeah.
638567	640668	Namco is the one that's going to be doing the...
668716	671419	The release of this, I believe.
671499	672781	I thought I saw Namco's name on it.
672801	680830	Well, it's certainly possible like a studio made it and Sony published it and now maybe the rights came out or something and now another studio is doing it.
680870	681130	I don't know.
681150	682311	That publishing stuff gets complicated.
682331	683933	Yeah, Mike Depp says it is a Sony title.
684393	687176	So, you know, but rights get weird.
688325	690186	We've seen... You've seen games... Everything is weird.
690226	692067	Yeah, and you've seen games... No, it is.
692267	692967	It is Sony.
693227	694268	It is a Sony title.
694288	697989	Yeah, it's a Sony Interactive Entertainment developed by Bandai Namco.
698229	705853	So it's kind of weird in that sense, but it is licensed and, yeah, it does have Sony as credited on there.
705873	716818	I was going to say, those weird sorts of things that happened before, like I, you know, throwing out there, like Illusion of Gaia and that series, Nintendo actually published, you know, here, and even though it was an Enix game at the time, and anyway...
718735	719035	Cool.
719195	727341	It's still a Sony, you know, a game that we all know from the Sony PSP, PS Vita sort of era coming out for Switch.
727401	728441	I think that is great.
728461	731163	I think it's going to get seen by a new crowd, which is pretty cool.
733084	739228	Then we have a story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, which is going to be coming to the Switch August 27th.
739788	743111	And that was a series that was on the original DS.
743131	745152	I remember that kind of, I think it's been off of Harvest Moon.
747051	764080	and of course like I mentioned Metroid Prime 4 Beyond that was a big thing that they showed off showing off actual gameplay and what it's going to kind of look like which it's a bit different looking but I like the way it looks and that is sometime in 2025 that that's coming out
764420	768004	I wonder if that's a holiday game or if it's going to be a Switch 2 release title.
769065	772989	I feel like that's kind of the unknown factor there, the question mark.
773389	775311	Are we going to get a version of that on Switch 2?
775351	785421	Are we going to see that game again next week that maybe is possibly a slight bit enhanced or just, you know, like in a Zelda Breath of the Wild kind of way, right?
785601	786342	Certainly, yeah.
786902	789004	Wii U, and Switch game.
789044	797211	It's just we're now in this unique situation where the Switch 2 will play Switch games, which wasn't a factor with the Wii U and Switch type of thing.
797471	798632	So it's going to be interesting to see.
798652	804337	I mean, there's a lot of interesting stuff that's going to be answered with next, hopefully, answered with next week's thing.
804637	807640	And that's where I'm at is I'm kind of like, okay, but is it going to be on the Switch 2?
807900	809341	Because I want the Switch 2 version of it.
809902	810122	That's...
811303	812804	Where my head is at with a lot of Switch games.
812844	814185	Of course you're going to want that.
814945	818868	Another game that they announced, Villains Cursed Cafe.
819008	828434	I don't know if this is like a mobile game that's being ported to the Switch, but it's a cafe game with dizzy villains and you make them drink some potions.
829835	830175	Okay.
830629	833690	I wanted to read a quick comment from chat on Story of Seasons.
833770	836590	Bobby Blackwolf does say that is the original Harvest Moon.
837150	840391	The Harvest Moon today is not the same series as the original Harvest Moon.
840531	844932	So Story of Seasons is for, you know, the old school fans, I guess.
845232	847813	So you were on the right line of thinking there, Loki.
848653	848873	Yeah.
849393	852454	I remember, like, this is going back to when I sold games.
852574	857335	I remember selling those and had the, you know... What's Harvest Moon?
857355	857395	No.
857475	857515	Um...
860353	874162	So this is cool, like in Witchbrook, it is an isometric pixel art RPG following, looks like someone going through like a magical academy and they have a different like co-op for up to four players.
875243	876424	Looks very pretty.
876944	878425	I really like the art style in it.
878845	882287	Now this is a magical university game I can get behind.
883388	883948	Yeah, exactly.
885389	885770	Exactly.
886110	887451	Unlike, nevermind.
888572	889132	Yep, yep, yep.
890428	893490	Then we had The Eternal Life of Goldman.
895011	897213	It's a hand-drawn platforming adventure game.
898113	899194	Looked pretty cool looking.
900816	901396	Let's see.
901936	906180	This one I got very excited about because I am a big fan of this series.
906620	907981	Gradius Origins.
908021	908762	Hell yes.
908902	909983	This is going to be awesome.
911178	915520	So it's all of the Gradius games put together, I think, for the most part.
916381	920683	I don't know if Gradius 5 was in there or not, but also a brand new game, Salamander 3.
921363	922984	That's what's extra rad about this.
923905	925366	Yeah, they're putting a new game in it.
925446	926306	Like, hell yes.
926446	929128	And I wonder if it was like a prototype that got canceled or something.
930728	931589	I'm so down for that.
931889	936472	I wonder if there will be repeats from the... Because Konami had an arcade collection...
937392	939113	I wouldn't have done it if I got it.
953845	957527	I mean, we've got the Salamander Deluxe Pack for Saturn.
957567	961430	We've got all kinds of collections because every time something comes out, we end up getting it.
961630	962070	Sure, sure.
962150	967093	It says it has, it says it comes with 17 versions, six titles from Arcade Origins.
967233	967873	Okay, okay.
967933	969674	So six titles, okay, that overlap.
969714	970715	That's it, Arcade Origins.
970795	971895	So six titles do overlap.
972176	973276	But that's okay, that's okay.
973356	979680	Yeah, Gradius, it looks like Gradius 2, Gradius, Gradius 3, Salamander, Salamander 2, and Life Force.
981038	985221	This feels like the album being re-released with some really solid extra tracks.
986682	987282	I'm fine with it.
987342	988043	It's been long enough.
989444	996188	Also, the 17 games we're talking about too, that includes also all of the different versions of the ROMs.
996609	1000632	So you have the JP and North American, Europe.
1000692	1002113	We're doing some creative counting.
1002313	1002473	Yeah.
1004395	1021474	and it should be like this will almost certainly not be a Nintendo exclusive thing this is just how a lot of people will probably pick it up because they have Nintendo memories from playing these games on the NES or they want the portable versions but I mean 99.99% this is out on PlayStation 5 and I would say 98% this is out on Xbox
1026600	1029742	They also have different modes in there as well.
1029782	1033245	So they have a rewind, so you can rewind it if you mess up.
1033825	1038469	Easy mode, with a smaller hit detection area.
1039229	1041011	And then they have invincible mode.
1041951	1045814	It counts the number of times the enemies... Let's see here.
1046815	1048296	I can't see because of this stuff.
1048316	1051579	Oh, like you're invincible, but it counts the number of times the enemies hit you.
1052751	1055952	so that you still have like a score to sort of achieve.
1055972	1057313	Those games are very difficult.
1058053	1063515	Like I, okay, I don't want to spoil my gaming week, but I randomly fucking played Life Force on the NES this week.
1064176	1067017	And I forgot how unforgiving that game is.
1067077	1069498	You literally have to memorize things in the stage.
1069538	1082083	Like that first stage with the brain boss, you have to remember like, oh, you got to take the top path because if you take the bottom path, it grows that kind of brain cell stuff or whatever it's supposed to be like right in front of you and you die.
1082543	1107377	so like you have to remember how to go certain paths to get through levels that's how those fucking arcade machines ate your quarters too so um yeah like in no shame in using invincible mode in some of these games like or you'll never see the end of them yeah the Konami code exists for a reason yeah that's that's true too Sean322 says spoiler alert oh give me for a game from 1987 sit down
1112328	1114029	I thought that was already a series.
1127301	1130462	Crypt of the NecroDancer, but this Rift is going to be different.
1130822	1136184	Yeah, so Crypt of the NecroDancer was more of like an actual dungeon crawling game where you had to move to the beat.
1136224	1137764	This is an actual rhythm game.
1138184	1140305	But you're still also attacking enemies and stuff.
1140325	1146867	There's like three different lanes and you kind of have to jump between those or hit the different buttons to do different attacks and stuff.
1146947	1148007	Real talk, folks.
1148307	1155169	If Harmonix wasn't going to make a new Rock Band Blitz for consoles, I'm glad somebody did it.
1155189	1156290	Legally distinct.
1156510	1156750	Yeah.
1158790	1159410	So we have that.
1159670	1168774	And then Tamagotchi Plaza looks crazy with all the different Miis in there.
1171195	1174256	So that's a thing coming June 27th.
1175376	1176757	And then what else?
1177797	1184680	We got more footage of Pokemon Legends Z to A. And yeah, it looks good.
1184920	1185420	Zach!
1186240	1190402	The game, I really hope, has a Switch 2 enhanced version.
1190722	1193324	Especially after... And I'm going to be completely honest.
1193384	1195685	I did not watch the Direct Live because, look...
1197702	1200244	Some time zone is going to get screwed in this whole thing.
1200264	1203187	When you're doing these worldwide announcements, some time zone is going to get screwed.
1203647	1205509	And we get screwed with a 6 a.m.
1205549	1206269	start time for this.
1206489	1209412	East Coast can have a nice little breakfast thing.
1209612	1210993	Europe is, what, 2 o'clock.
1211073	1212434	Japan is 10 o'clock.
1212474	1214056	That's like the evening news, right?
1214676	1215557	We get 6 a.m.
1215597	1218059	The only time zone I would say that has it worse than us is Hawaii.
1218079	1218740	I mean, there's...
1220461	1222982	Hawaii's like three or four in the morning.
1223022	1226004	They're just not going to be watching this unless they get up early.
1226344	1230806	So I don't really watch these things live when they're that early because I value my sleep.
1231246	1238730	But I did watch the Z to A and I was like, oh, I hope they get a more powerful system to put this on.
1239471	1267105	It's gonna be a lot of the same problems from Gen 10 It's gotta be It's gotta be Oh my god, please, please Game Freak, please, hear my prayers Why would you make a brand new console and then just like, oh yeah it's not gonna be on that brand new console, it's gonna be stuck with the lower power, come on It's a Pokemon game, of course they're going to We'll see We'll see, we'll see
1268582	1274766	Anyways, another neat surprise, Rhythm Heaven Groove, brand new Rhythm Heaven game coming to the Switch as well.
1275807	1277969	Do you know what my TikTok algorithm has found?
1278729	1284333	People live reacting to the Rhythm Heaven announcement and losing their fucking mind.
1284413	1292439	And the funny thing is, what always gives it away is that very distinct advancing the text box noise that the Rhythm Heaven games have.
1292839	1295941	Like everybody's kind of looking at it at first like, is this Rhythm Heaven?
1296041	1323067	could it be and then the text advances everybody goes oh my god it's rhythm heaven you know the way everybody hacks online during these live react things and it's pretty funny so yeah no I'm excited too so then breaking up all the game announcements and different things releasing there was an announcement of a brand new system that is coming to Nintendo and that is this virtual game card system
1323567	1334372	and what it is, it is a way to be able to trade and loan out your digital game library to other Switches or Switch 2s.
1334972	1342735	So, for example, if you live in a household... There's a very important asterisk here because I was excited until this asterisk.
1342755	1343936	I was like, well, this does nothing for me.
1344256	1346077	Bobby took a deep dive on this on his show tonight.
1346757	1348878	Especially locally.
1349458	1352640	No, they have to be on your family plan and locally.
1353826	1356048	So you can only share with people on your family plan.
1356809	1357330	Yeah, it works.
1357350	1359972	Because I'm on a family plan with friends.
1361033	1362775	Yeah, so no, that works.
1362895	1366359	If you're on a family plan with friends and you go visit those friends in person, you can loan the games.
1366499	1367119	That's great.
1367600	1370523	But for me, I'm not on a family plan.
1370543	1374186	And even if Alan and I were on a family plan, it wouldn't do us a lot of good.
1374727	1377470	I was hoping it was without the asterisk.
1377850	1388397	That you just had to be on the same local network, which I'm totally okay with because loaning games across the internet would lead to all sorts of weird Reddit circles and things and it would hurt game developers.
1388957	1400744	But locally, oh my god, that would add so much value to digital games to be able to be like, hey, so we're getting together in person to play Mario Party and oh shit, you have Bellatro?
1400964	1401665	Can I borrow that?
1402405	1424484	and you just click you just do it digitally and you can't play it for 14 days but they can it's like loaning out a cartridge but you know that cartridge is coming back in 14 days and if that's not enough time you do it again although I don't think we know the cool down period but unfortunately it is limited to family plans which my hope fingers crossed toes crossed eyes crossed my hope is that
1425225	1428129	This is maybe the test for maybe making it broader.
1428409	1436299	And I'm even okay if they limit it to people on your Nintendo friends list so that you can't just like go to a random convention and loan out games for your booth or something.
1436319	1438161	I have to be on your friends list.
1438241	1439963	I think it's both though.
1440204	1443027	I think you can lend it to people that are in your...
1443928	1444668	Okay, okay.
1444688	1445169	Yeah.
1467481	1471063	If you have two systems... Okay, here's what it says on the Nintendo.com website.
1471144	1474626	So we're going... I'm going... I'm going to the source to figure this out.
1474746	1479949	It says, the virtual game card feature for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 systems adds some of the flexibility.
1480450	1484753	If you have two systems, you can digitally eject and load games from one system to another.
1485613	1489238	and you can even lend games to members of your Nintendo account family group.
1489618	1491601	This is the wording that worries me.
1491901	1499690	If you have two systems, that doesn't mean you and somebody... If you have a system and your friend has a system, or that would be worded differently.
1500051	1500872	So this is like...
1501372	1505435	because Nintendo has released a Switch, a Switch Lite, a Switch OLED.
1505836	1509058	It is very – or your Shane and you buy all the Pokemon Switches.
1509158	1510960	This is a Shane feature.
1511220	1515443	That's who's going to benefit from this with his 17 Switches and Pokemon games.
1515924	1523209	You can loan the games amongst yourself, but it doesn't do anything with friends or anything like that, which is –
1524246	1524927	Kind of a bummer.
1524967	1530711	Yeah, and then land games to members of your Nintendo account family group.
1531151	1533794	Nothing to do with the other part about having the multiple systems.
1534714	1536776	So yeah, Loki, I'm right there with you, though.
1536876	1540359	The wording was, or at least the way I understood it, because again, I didn't watch it live.
1540419	1542681	The way I understood it at first was like really exciting.
1542701	1545683	I was like, holy shit, Nintendo ahead of its time.
1545763	1546984	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
1547024	1548325	Like this whole thing, right?
1548846	1551428	And then when I saw the rest of it, I was like, oh.
1552609	1553489	Not as exciting.
1553950	1560075	Except, and to be fair, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Nintendo thinks people will have a Switch and a Switch 2.
1561016	1561796	Of course they will.
1562156	1563237	I will have a Switch and a Switch 2.
1563778	1564919	So that will be useful.
1565139	1574227	I can get the digital loading from my original Switch so I can play things like Pokemon Scarlet, which I bought digitally, on my Switch 2.
1574867	1577070	So yes, there is still some benefit for me.
1578072	1589988	And maybe this is what it is because my thought was, well, why wouldn't it just be like the fucking PlayStation where I go in the store and I download the game just like I did on PlayStation, but maybe it's some funky thing with rights.
1590208	1590769	I don't know.
1591590	1592931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1612421	1613223	This could be so big.
1613383	1617512	Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to derail too much, but it is a weird Enigma thing.
1617592	1619155	Maybe we'll hear more about it next week.
1619596	1622662	But yeah, it's not as exciting as it could have been.
1624375	1625096	No, understandable.
1625116	1627677	Yeah, it's a little confusing.
1628078	1628798	But it's exciting.
1629699	1637404	Like, if you are two parents and two kids, if you're a two-parent, two-kid household type of thing, oh my god, this is huge for you.
1637765	1644750	Fuck, even if you're just a two-adult household that both actively game, like a Jamie and Dan household that both actively game, yeah, you can like lend...
1645874	1646795	games between each other.
1646895	1650098	But like Loki, for you, I don't, you have a Switch.
1650118	1651500	I imagine your kids have a Switch.
1652040	1653321	You can all loan games to each other.
1653341	1654322	Oh, you only have one.
1654342	1656144	Well, there'll be a Switch 2 at some point, I'm sure.
1656745	1658747	I honestly didn't pay for my Switch.
1658987	1659708	I went in at work.
1659948	1660428	It doesn't matter.
1660488	1660829	It's yours.
1662090	1668176	Yeah, but it means, I mean, there's no logical reason for us to have more than one in this house.
1668396	1668916	Yeah, I get it.
1668976	1669317	I get it.
1670345	1677509	I mean, we're probably going to get a Switch 2, but we didn't get a PS5 or an Xbox, you know?
1678429	1680911	We kind of were just like, done with it.
1681011	1682071	I already know I'm getting a Switch.
1682091	1683352	The whole social thing, kind of done with it.
1683632	1687634	I'll get a Switch 2 day one, provided the pre-orders allow me to.
1688014	1695238	That is my biggest scare right now, is that it's going to be a cluster fucky McFuckerson town trying to get one of those Switch 2 pre-orders.
1696178	1700441	I'll be honest, I'm probably going to get a stream deck before I get a Switch 2.
1702523	1704004	A stream deck or a Steam deck?
1704764	1705705	Steam deck, whatever.
1705785	1708627	I've got a bajillion stream decks already.
1709508	1710368	A Steam deck.
1710528	1711169	Steam decks are fun.
1711289	1715432	Because it's going to have a bigger library on it.
1715812	1717694	It's still handheld.
1718114	1720055	I can still plug it into my TV.
1721056	1721957	I already have one.
1721977	1724318	I'm not super excited about the Switch 2.
1726222	1753693	I won't be excited until there's a game on it I give a shit about well let's check in after April 2nd because that'll be Nintendo's chance to say here are the games to substantiate your hype so we'll see, let's check back in next week so alright, anyway, sorry Loki but that was an important point and then yeah, there are a bunch of smaller announcements so High End Life is getting ported to the Switch on May 6th that's the Rick and Morty gun game, right?
1754608	1755568	Yes, basically.
1756649	1764072	Star Overdrive is another cool-looking game that's coming out on April 10th.
1765513	1775937	Kind of a... It almost has a similar art style to Sunset Overdrive or... What was the other one?
1776777	1780639	I don't know, but it's a futuristic hoverboard action game.
1781462	1782622	Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals Time
1805270	1807511	Yeah, so that's coming out May 21st.
1808712	1809493	Clearment calendar.
1809753	1811014	That's right around Memorial Day again.
1811574	1813755	Saga Frontier 2 Remastered.
1814296	1815336	Gorgeous looking game.
1816757	1819359	That's going to be... That was one of those, hey, it's out today.
1819659	1820539	So it's out now.
1820820	1821340	Go check it out.
1821440	1826323	I have to just... Y'all know I did not care for the original Saga Frontier, but maybe I'd like to.
1826443	1826783	I don't know.
1827143	1828064	There's so much to play.
1828584	1833848	Monument Valley 1 and 2, and apparently 3 now, are going to...
1834758	1835078	Everybody's Golf
1861888	1863551	Otherwise known as Hot Shots.
1864112	1867558	It's actually called Everybody's Golf Hot Shots because it's Hot Shots Golf here.
1867578	1869903	Resident Evil Biohazard.
1871325	1872027	Yes, exactly.
1874338	1875018	That's great.
1875258	1884642	And then one of the games that I'm most excited about, a brand new beat-em-up fighting game called Marvel Cosmic Invasion.
1884682	1888024	It's by the folks that did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game originally.
1888084	1890845	So it's kind of a throwback to the old arcade stuff.
1890885	1891525	That's going to be fun.
1891585	1892905	Very excited to play that.
1893606	1896107	I wonder if that's going to be like those Marvel Ultimate games.
1896127	1897767	I remember Jamie was super into those games.
1898528	1899288	No, it's not.
1899388	1901789	It's just a pure side-scroller beat-em-up.
1901889	1902690	Well, that'll still be fun.
1902790	1905735	That'll be like the, I don't know, like the X-Men side-scroller.
1905755	1908900	It'll be like the Avengers game or the X-Men game that was in arcades.
1908920	1909481	That'll still be fun.
1911343	1912746	With a much larger cast, it seems.
1914003	1919007	Is it going to be as big as that fucking Avenger Doomsday cast they announced this week?
1919047	1919967	Because, Jesus.
1920268	1920628	Oh, God.
1920908	1921609	I didn't even look.
1921869	1922309	Oh, did you?
1922389	1922689	Okay.
1923010	1925892	All you need to know, Alan Cumming is coming back as Nightcrawler.
1926492	1927133	All you need to know.
1927393	1933857	Yeah, because what made me laugh is that, like, Tigerclaw was trying to post the entire cast list for the movie.
1934458	1937480	And because we have some type of official Discord group,
1937840	1938460	I don't know.
1938560	1942961	We have to, in order to have some status we have in Discord, we have to have some mod filter on.
1943321	1946662	And the mod filter rejected Tigerclaw's post like three times.
1946722	1949622	And I'm sure he couldn't figure out, like, I'm not swearing in this.
1949682	1951843	Like, what is rejecting this post?
1952123	1953763	It's because he was trying to put the word coming.
1958124	1962265	Because Alan Cumming is coming back as Nightcrawler.
1963385	1967186	I have to rethink my entire life choices now.
1967512	1968012	I know, right?
1968072	1975776	It's so... I realize this is outside video games, but I just need us all to take a minute to appreciate Alan Cumming.
1975936	1977596	Can we all take a minute to appreciate Alan Cumming?
1978057	1982418	Because, like, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, hello, one of the best.
1983299	1990362	The Traitors, which literally, if you're going to watch any reality TV show made in the last 10 years...
1990942	2014451	you should watch the traitors it's fucking incredible television and 99% of that is because of Alan Cumming there is a reason he somebody finally dethroned RuPaul as best game show host and that was Alan Cumming he is incredible on that show okay I stopped to look over the cast and I mean I knew about about Downey being Dr. Doom but still oh yeah this is actually pretty it's
2016064	2017465	Okay, I'm officially happy.
2017985	2019667	I'm officially happy.
2043503	2043823	Anyway.
2044904	2045365	All right, all right.
2045405	2046105	Marvel beat him up.
2046466	2046706	Anyway.
2048587	2048827	Yes.
2049708	2050889	Anyways, a couple more things.
2050909	2051770	Sorry, sorry.
2051850	2052210	I'm sorry.
2052270	2052730	No, Loki.
2052750	2054812	Because chat comments derailed me yet again.
2055172	2057614	Bobby Blackwolf in chat put, everyone is here.
2058215	2058935	I need to see.
2059275	2060176	Here's the meme I need.
2060336	2062718	I need to see the Marvel Doomsday cast right there.
2063138	2067422	And then I need that Sakurai meme where he says, never ask me for anything ever again.
2067442	2067522	Yeah.
2074844	2075104	All right.
2075164	2075985	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
2076125	2076785	I mean it this time.
2078026	2082529	OK, so we had a couple more things that were announced.
2083069	2087012	So one of those, of course, was Tomodachi Life Living the Dream.
2087172	2090494	This is the game I was thinking about when we were talking about the Tomodachi thing before.
2091055	2097158	So this one's the weird me game that's coming out next year, which probably is a switch.
2097199	2098539	Do you remember this on the DS?
2098559	2098800	Yes.
2099781	2100621	It was weird.
2100821	2105962	It was a little bit controversial because you couldn't have a same-sex relationship in the game.
2107003	2111063	It got a lot of controversy for that, and I think, you know, some of us were like, well, fuck that game then.
2111143	2117445	But it kind of became a little bit of an underground classic, and a lot of memes were made out of that game.
2117945	2121066	Like, I just remember... Now I have to find it.
2121346	2122066	I have to find it.
2122446	2123026	It's too good.
2123346	2127167	There are these YouTubes of, like, the characters singing...
2129659	2135607	You can make your characters sing with all these original lyrics and things like that, which is great.
2136889	2144118	In fact, even the trailer kind of had one of those memes with the big face that was like, do you want to talk?
2144459	2144579	Like,
2145539	2167164	that was really funny I think that game is really supposed to be like the meme game but this is the meme I was thinking of is that it's this and you're going to hear a little bit of audio that comes through this game and it's I Don't Know Her and it's Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj singing
2172481	2174802	I don't know her.
2174982	2175663	Anyway, trust me.
2175823	2176183	Trust me.
2176243	2176663	It's funny.
2177224	2177704	It's funny.
2180525	2181206	Look up the video.
2181946	2182546	Look up the video.
2182626	2183047	You'll laugh.
2183587	2184127	You'll chuckle.
2184787	2185728	You'll lightly teehee.
2187329	2188890	So yes, we're getting Meme Generator 2.0.
2190390	2206532	Yes, and then the last piece of news was that they were going to be launching another app called Nintendo Today, which keeps you up to date with all the Nintendo news, including a big bombshell that they dropped in that, but we'll talk about that later.
2206772	2210434	Yes, so well, but it also shows that this is Nintendo's attempt.
2210954	2215517	It's an interesting way to take the Nintendo Direct concept one step further.
2216177	2221600	What if Nintendo, instead of waiting for that Direct, could send you a push notification to tell you the news?
2222961	2236968	It's, you know, for as much shit as Nintendo gets for not being very clue-filled when it comes to being online, and rightfully so, this does seem like a very forward-thinking type of thing, if they can compel people to install that app.
2237904	2256788	which I'm not sure the calendar well actually no the calendar thing is kind of cute because you can turn those into widgets at least on Apple and I'm assuming Google's the same thing so on Apple you know how Apple has like the widgets on the screen and stuff you can actually have like a Nintendo branded widget that you can like have your calendar with that
2258164	2260105	That's going to be cute for some people.
2260165	2266488	If you don't really care about branded stuff or seeing Animal Crossing characters all over your phone, then whatever.
2266528	2267269	You're probably not going to care.
2267329	2283957	But it's a little something to make a little widget for your home screen and now get some of these announcements and things pushed to you, which Nintendo utilized the day after they announced this to get people to install it on their phones so people could be like, oh shit, Nintendo's going to drop bombshells with this thing.
2284477	2302464	so I'm very curious to see what happens after next week with the Switch 2 announcements and what sort of things get pushed out in that app so I mean it's free I had no problem installing Nintendo today your phone your business install what you want but free is a great price free 99 yep
2307745	2311789	By the way, the Tamodachi Life announcement, also a big TikTok meme.
2311849	2316094	People losing their fucking mind over that game, which I did not realize that game.
2316694	2325644	But I think, I feel like the people I'm seeing losing their mind are all of a certain age where they were like probably like 11, 12 years old when that game first came out.
2326244	2330549	And so this is like a huge deal, you know, because I'm sure that game was all around them.
2330749	2333570	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2356696	2359277	But we don't want to start the show during the ads.
2359557	2366059	And we do that to drop the pre-roll so people can jump right into our show at the beginning without Twitch forcing ads on you.
2366139	2366499	Trust me.
2366539	2367780	There's reasons for all this.
2368180	2371781	So we have what's called the cat roll, which shows all of our different cats.
2371821	2374502	And I think we've been open to adding other pets to it too.
2374522	2375642	But for right now, it's only cats.
2376162	2383065	And it's current and past because Mr. Smush is in it and Midna and Shermie is in it.
2383085	2383345	Yeah.
2384605	2385826	There might even be a Sanrio picture.
2386246	2387567	So we have all the cats.
2387767	2393510	But there's one picture in there that's like DarkSakura is me like falling asleep on the cat.
2393990	2398232	And that's either the native 3D photo thing or that's from the original Tomodachi life.
2398973	2401814	That is from – that actually has nothing to do with it.
2401834	2406997	That's from – what was that me thing on iPhone?
2407237	2407357	Oh.
2408068	2409269	Oh, Miitopia!
2410149	2410349	Oh!
2411569	2412730	Miitomo.
2413410	2414890	I forgot all about that.
2415431	2415991	Oh, shit.
2416051	2416771	Okay, Pwned.
2417311	2417651	Pwned.
2417871	2418572	Alright, never mind.
2419692	2421172	I thought it was a Tomodachi Life thing.
2422373	2423613	I've never played Tomodachi Life.
2423933	2424153	Well...
2427481	2427781	Oh, well.
2428061	2428381	All right.
2428642	2429422	So that's what that was.
2430162	2431683	Well, I'm hoping this one will be good.
2431963	2437526	And as far as the relationships thing goes, it's, you know, in 2025, we've made some fucking progress in that department.
2437866	2444689	So Nintendo doesn't fuck that up and make it a controversy in 2025 because love has no boundaries.
2444989	2448651	And I think most decent people know that now in 2025.
2449091	2452152	If you haven't figured that out, I don't know how to explain it to you any further.
2452892	2454533	So we'll see what happens with this game.
2455073	2455994	Hopefully it's going to be a lot of fun.
2457742	2458943	But the preview was really funny.
2459223	2464848	Did you notice in the preview, like it comes up, it shows the beach and everybody goes, animal crossing, but it's not.
2465169	2468251	And then the next shot is a me sleeping on the chair.
2468772	2471254	And you might miss this the first time you watch the trailer.
2471354	2483685	If you missed it, go back and watch because right before it fades into the next scene, the me that's asleep in the chair makes a little sound, a little poot sound and a little cloud comes out of their butt.
2486620	2489305	It's so silly, but it's hilarious.
2489365	2492830	But that's like your first clue that this is Tomodachi Life.
2495743	2497344	Anyway, all right.
2497844	2498124	All right.
2498704	2501585	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games.
2501905	2502065	Yeah.
2502126	2505287	Mike Defton chat says, yeah, the beach scene threw me for a loop.
2505347	2506607	Thought it was Animal Crossing.
2506947	2510109	I mean, reasonable guess, reasonable expectations.
2510569	2516291	I feel like that is going to be a sure thing for Switch 2, whether now or next year, like Animal Crossing is going to happen.
2516991	2518712	But yeah, the fart got me like, what?
2518912	2519972	Yeah, it's funny.
2520292	2520513	Anyway.
2520873	2521093	All right.
2522013	2523894	Farting or not, let's talk about our gaming week.
2523914	2525715	Some types of games we have been playing this week.
2525955	2527876	DarkSakura, how was your pooting week?
2530638	2531138	Dear lord.
2531658	2532619	I've had a very busy week.
2533800	2537602	But I have played a lot of Bellatro.
2537742	2542004	It's like my fill-in-the-time stuff, you know?
2544946	2548908	I've been playing my Fruit Mountain game again and finally broke...
2549972	2576814	I had been stuck at like the most I've gotten was like around the 4,000 point range and I broke 7,000 points and the next best I was able to get is over 5,000 so I'm getting a little bit better at it I also of course played Dead by Daylight I've played Palia I've played some Dragon Age, the Veil Guard I've played Monster Hunter Wilds which I really like the game but it makes me motion sick and I still hate the controls
2579147	2580108	I'm getting better at it, though.
2580248	2580968	I'm getting better at it.
2583830	2592976	And, I mean, I'm not, I kind of want to do something different, and I'm still debating my retro night if I'm going to do Wonder Project J or Marvelous.
2593737	2595698	So, suggestions would be nice.
2596619	2598500	But other than that, yeah.
2599561	2600241	Alright, cool.
2600761	2601382	Let's go to Loki.
2601402	2602783	There's a lot of World Cup today.
2603844	2604504	World Cup soccer.
2604584	2606645	No problem with pinball.
2607526	2608807	Loki, how was your game of the week?
2610220	2612088	It's pretty much just Minecraft as usual.
2612891	2613453	We had
2615543	2618045	A lot of work that I've been doing on like episodes.
2618125	2620887	So I've put out fourth week in a row now.
2621468	2623129	Don't know how long that's going to continue on.
2623469	2629013	And then still have working on Storage Room, which is going to be the next episode.
2630234	2631755	And Bellatro.
2632116	2633697	Played a little bit of Bellatro as well.
2634377	2639521	Still trying to get all the chips in one of the specific card sets just to...
2640362	2641423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2657099	2658881	Yeah, I gotta check that out myself.
2676701	2677542	I'm inside your mind.
2677582	2677883	One of the
2696064	2697285	Best puzzle games ever.
2697365	2700988	There's a reason why they let him do Tetris, him being Mizuguchi.
2701948	2702929	Luminous is just so good.
2703029	2707673	So yeah, I was playing like the Switch version or, you know, the re-release of the original on the Switch a couple years ago.
2708513	2709354	It was fun.
2709414	2711075	And then just like random retro games.
2711215	2714057	I've been, you know, going down a random retro rabbit hole.
2714818	2716920	I was playing some of Super Mario World the other day.
2717340	2717640	Why?
2718541	2718981	Why not?
2719622	2720983	It's one of the best games ever made.
2721043	2721823	Why wouldn't I play it?
2722524	2722644	So...
2723973	2733176	I do need to get cracking on some more recent games, but when you have all the retro games to catch up on, you know, it doesn't matter when the game was made.
2733216	2734096	A good game is a good game.
2734396	2735157	I guess that's what it is.
2736597	2740598	All right, let's move on to some more stories for this week.
2741399	2742219	Loki, we'll start with you.
2743274	2744014	Last Chance Launch Rumors
2763383	2782295	now this is something that I would say that we floated as a possibility based off of the time frame from the original Switch launch which they announced the Switch back in I think January and then launched it in March so now if they're doing like the official unveil in April it you know
2783530	2784371	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2800592	2814472	They are planning on a June release with a multi-phase rollout that would see the release strategy around Switch 2 games shift from first party to third party as the year progresses, but basically launching with a lot more first party games first.
2815433	2817575	That's very similar to the original Switch's strategy.
2817615	2821099	It was making sure that there was something coming out every month, even if it was third party.
2821159	2827224	So just like, I want to say Mario and Rabbids early on was like a flagship title, even though it was an Ubisoft game and not a Nintendo game.
2827645	2836493	So again, there's a lot, you know, if you are to believe Nintendo's, if it ain't broke, don't fix it method of launching this system, that makes a lot of sense.
2836573	2836853	And I...
2837674	2839575	I'm tempering my expectations with June.
2839675	2840796	Of course, I hope it's June.
2841537	2842657	June makes a lot of sense.
2842877	2846700	It's right when the kiddos are getting out of school or even the college kids are getting out of school.
2847200	2850502	It is before the end of the fiscal year, so they can really bump the numbers.
2851643	2853124	And they still would get a holiday to get through.
2853144	2855466	So a lot with June makes sense.
2856326	2860912	But at the same time, I don't want to set June as an expectation.
2861573	2866699	I want to be fully aware that Nintendo very well could come out and say, coming holiday 2025.
2867079	2869763	And I think that's where you should put your expectation.
2870143	2873207	And then that way, if they say June, yay, you're pleasantly surprised.
2874448	2875650	Yeah.
2876111	2883182	Along with that, there's a rumor that there may be some hints that Switch 2 upgrades for older games might be a thing.
2884103	2887549	According to some of the fine print that was out...
2889076	2890578	Talk about the virtual card system.
2891018	2899506	It says the Nintendo Switch exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 edition games can only be loaded in Nintendo Switch 2 systems.
2900287	2904792	So Nintendo Switch 2 edition games and exclusive games.
2905292	2911438	So it sounds like that you could have a version that there's multiple versions of said game.
2912369	2913250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2929622	2933565	Like they did with the PlayStation and I think even like some of the Xbox stuff.
2933645	2936367	But PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 had that stuff.
2936607	2938228	I'm of a few mindsets about this.
2938368	2945774	As long as they make the performance enhancements worth the price, I'm okay with an upgrade price if I already owned it on Switch.
2946294	2957843	And I also fully realize this would leave room for, let's say, Metroid Prime 4 on the original Switch is going to be $59.99, which was the price of games on the PlayStation 4 a while ago, or
2958323	2960385	or even, you know, a while ago in games.
2960465	2967510	And then the addition on the Switch 2 is $69.99, which is more in line with the price of current games on other consoles.
2967670	2971854	But maybe the performance enhancements will justify that bump.
2971894	2977979	But what I don't want to see is that I have to rebuy, like that $10 upgrade or whatever better be a thing.
2978099	2983063	Because if I have to rebuy things like Pokemon Legends to get them to run better, I probably just won't.
2983963	3004982	and that's going to be really disappointing because that's some of the thing that is anticipating me most about this system is being able to play things like Pokemon Legends and especially Pokemon Scarlet Violet which badly needed better hardware on better hardware so let's see but also I think something to keep in mind
3005703	3008504	This isn't necessarily limited to Nintendo's first party.
3008905	3013807	I absolutely believe there will be third-party games that will put out Nintendo Switch 2 editions of their games.
3014307	3017669	Number one on the list, I would say Hello Games' No Man's Sky.
3018129	3021011	Garen fucking T, there's going to be a Switch 2 version of that game.
3021071	3022211	Why the fuck wouldn't there be?
3023232	3025633	It literally releases on every other system.
3026133	3028855	You can expect there will be a No Man's Sky release on Switch 2.
3029115	3034057	Now the question is, will they charge you again for it, or will they give you a free upgrade?
3034357	3035018	Just so you know,
3035598	3039382	You got a free upgrade if you had it on PS4 and then you put that PS4 in the PS5.
3039763	3041765	So that would be kind of the model I'd be expecting.
3041845	3043607	But, you know, we'll see.
3043727	3049934	I don't know how the Nintendo system will mess things up, but it'll hurt sales, I think.
3050935	3055500	Or I should say it's not going to inflate sales to make people buy that thing full price all over again.
3056824	3063051	Another third-party game I would fully expect to see, Diablo 4, which I actually don't think had a release on the original Switch.
3063071	3064612	I don't think Diablo 4 is on the Switch.
3065053	3073241	So I think some of these launch titles are going to be filling out the plate of things that got skipped over on Nintendo because the system wasn't good enough.
3073581	3075503	Diablo 4, Final Fantasy XIV.
3076584	3079485	Final Fantasy XV and XVI while we're at it.
3080046	3085088	I think there's going to be a lot of gap filling, but I just hope Nintendo isn't relying on that.
3085588	3091391	It's not going to be enough to let those types of third-party games carry your system forever.
3091651	3093272	Maybe for a few months, but not for forever.
3094690	3098094	Yeah, because they need to be in the situation of the Wii U, essentially.
3098374	3099795	Yeah, exactly, exactly.
3099895	3106122	So they need to not do the Wii, like, re-releases of old-ass games are not going to carry your system.
3106222	3112889	But, hell yeah, there's going to be people that will buy Diablo 4 when it's portable, or any of those games I named that you can play on Switch 2.
3114170	3114871	So, we'll see.
3118598	3119178	Very exciting.
3119259	3119379	Yeah.
3119419	3120700	It'll be interesting to see.
3120760	3122241	I mean, we've only got a couple more days to wait.
3122261	3122741	That's right.
3123161	3125843	It's weird to think in seven days we'll finally know.
3125863	3129466	Actually, less than seven days, but we'll be back here in seven days when we finally know.
3129706	3134550	Although maybe we need to do an emergency stream that night of the announcements to...
3136644	3138185	Decompress all that stuff.
3138486	3138866	We'll see.
3139026	3139286	We'll see.
3154136	3158017	That's right, it wasn't reported by Deadline, like a Hollywood industry thing.
3158057	3160098	It wasn't reported by a video game blog.
3160538	3171201	Nintendo decided to put that information out themselves with a very quick, I wouldn't even call it teaser trailer, I would call it logo, because it was like a logo display and then the date.
3171661	3175082	And the date of the Zelda movie is March 26th, 2027.
3177143	3178383	So you have two years to wait.
3178423	3181604	In two years, you will see a Zelda movie, if you want to.
3182424	3188349	Now there are some more rumors that have kind of followed up since then on this movie.
3188449	3195074	Number one, that it's going to be a trilogy and that they are locking in the principal actors who have apparently already been cast.
3195494	3205602	They are locking in the principal actors between, I think it's Link, Zelda, Impa, and like one other character I think are going to be locked in for a six year, three movie deal.
3206043	3207404	So they're going to have to do all the movies.
3208704	3229077	and that this film is going to start shooting in New Zealand this winter which our winter is their summer so if we talk about a November shooting it'll be it'll be beautiful weather down in New Zealand New Zealand of course being where they shot the Lord of the Rings movies which were infamously well known for just how fucking gorgeous the scenery was and I mean
3230663	3234345	I mean, in many ways, I think this movie has the potential to be huge.
3234546	3236867	I think locking him into a trilogy is a smart idea.
3237388	3241390	I think this movie does stand to do very well as long as the script doesn't suck.
3241790	3243512	Oh, God, I hope the script doesn't suck.
3243872	3245073	But the Mario movie was cool.
3245253	3245773	It was fine.
3246273	3250736	You know, any problem... This is a live-action movie instead of an animated movie.
3250836	3255339	I know, so there's a lot that could go wrong, but there's a lot that could go right.
3255880	3260363	And it's interesting that there are these comparisons to Lord of the Rings because, honestly,
3261303	3264206	and I'll probably get hazed for this comment, but I'm going to own it.
3264426	3266687	I think this is like a millennial Lord of the Rings.
3267168	3267728	I really do.
3268509	3274073	By the time this movie actually hits theaters, think about it.
3274573	3280777	Those of us, and I'm pointing at us, maybe we're more Gen X, Zillennial, whatever, but we're going to be
3281898	3308576	Push in 50 if not in our 50s by the time these movies finally hit theaters and most a lot of our friendos will be taking their kids this will be a whole family thing because it's like you grew up with the modern Zelda games and I grew up with the old school Zelda games and we're coming together to see the Zelda like it's instead of growing up with the books we all grew up with the games and this is going to be like a huge moment in pop culture I really do think again please
3309540	3310661	Don't be a shitty movie.
3310781	3312261	Like I don't know how else to put it.
3312662	3316804	I'm really putting my faith in that the Mario movie shows that they can do good enough.
3317304	3322927	But like, I don't want to get too wacky talking.
3323327	3328089	This has the potential to be like an Oscar caliber type of movie if they don't fuck it up.
3328989	3330350	It has the potential to be that good.
3331611	3333872	Because it's going to mean that much to a lot of people.
3334994	3335214	DJ Ranma S
3352777	3379399	maybe second unit type of stuff especially if there are like maybe snow type scenes in it because we don't really know what they're doing but I don't think they will film anything until they announce the principles because there will be leaks otherwise and everybody wants control over this information so yeah I would say second yeah b-roll stuff second unit maybe that stuff could already be being made sure I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility but things with actual actors probably not um
3381061	3384765	Let's see, Tigerclaw says the movies could be adapting the first three games.
3385405	3388288	There's a lot it could be doing, and we don't know.
3388348	3390570	And the Zelda timeline is very complicated.
3390911	3394975	And quite honest, I honestly think they're gonna pull...
3397392	3401073	It's gonna be like the Oz stuff, like Return to Oz.
3401713	3406774	Return to Oz pulled from two books to sort of create one story, for better or for worse.
3406874	3408194	Not everybody cared for that movie.
3408614	3410534	But I feel it's a similar thing.
3410554	3412315	There's like 20-something Oz books.
3412635	3413995	There's 20-something Zelda games.
3414115	3421616	They're gonna pull a little from column A and a little from column B, but they're gonna have to make one story out of multiple things.
3421656	3423337	And I think they could do it.
3423477	3424257	We'll see what happens.
3424757	3429578	It'll be or it might be like a completely original type of idea that also exists in the same timeline.
3430338	3431459	I think there's a lot of ways to do it.
3431539	3431859	We'll see.
3433339	3433459	Yeah.
3433499	3437680	And Quest Buster says talks about the New Zealand filming and says, let's go Lord of the Ring fans.
3438020	3447082	Hey, if you're in New Zealand now, now your tourism is going to be Lord of the Rings visiting and Zelda visiting if the movie is good.
3447442	3452804	So if I'm in New Zealand, I'm fucking getting out the confetti cannons right now for my tourism industry.
3452824	3453644	Yeah.
3454284	3457607	TigerClaw in chat says, do the Zelda movies based on the original games.
3457867	3461109	Then if they're successful, the sequels would have to be based on the 3D Zelda games.
3461509	3462450	Every game is a rehash.
3462470	3463811	You have to rescue the princess in each one.
3463831	3467294	And that's why I don't think it's going to just one for one the movies.
3467454	3473078	And I would not expect the rescue the princess trope to translate very well into the movies.
3474099	3475740	Sheik will exist in the movies.
3476581	3477741	I will bet the farm on that.
3478082	3479423	Sheik will exist in the movies.
3480407	3484209	because they're not gonna go with the damsel in distress trope for the movies.
3485209	3488550	Yeah, but she was hardly a damsel in distress in Tears of the Kingdom.
3488751	3495773	Right, so there's gonna be, they're gonna incorporate a little from column A and a little from column B to well round out these characters.
3496034	3503737	Well, just like they did in the Mario movie and instead they flipped the script and Luigi was the damsel in distress, so to speak.
3503797	3506378	It was a little different than that, but they flipped the script.
3506638	3507299	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3529093	3534756	There's a lot of armchair critics with this, and I'm going to tell you, and I made a bleat on Blue Sky about this.
3535557	3544422	The day that that trailer comes out for the Zelda movie, I'm logging the fuck off because fans are going to be insufferable when that trailer comes out.
3545262	3571679	present company included, myself fans are going to be insufferable when that trailer comes out because everybody is going to be nitpicking every little frame there's going to be 3 hour YouTubes there's going to be live reacts it's all going to be there and it's going to be insufferable but I think what could be interesting is that Nintendo could roll out that trailer within the Nintendo Today app first
3572793	3579665	It's not to say it won't get copy-posted onto YouTube and all the other places, but Nintendo has the ability to put out that trailer on their Today app first.
3580507	3580827	We'll see.
3581926	3583387	Alright, anyway, enough on that.
3584287	3585367	It's just a release date.
3585648	3592110	But the reality, like for me, this release date is like reality that these movies are happening.
3592471	3594451	And they're not going to be stuck in development hell.
3595172	3600154	Like the only thing that could go wrong now is that it's a Warner Brothers movie that gets hosed to be a tax write-off.
3600214	3601895	But thankfully it's not a Warner Brothers movie.
3602395	3604076	So... It's a Sony movie.
3604096	3604916	It's a Sony, yeah.
3604956	3607037	Nothing wrong with any Sony movies.
3607357	3607477	Hmm.
3608959	3610481	So we're just going to hope that doesn't happen.
3611262	3616047	Like, they ought to be contractually obliged with Nintendo to actually release the movie.
3616988	3618109	Anyway, we'll see what happens.
3618670	3619090	DarkSakura.
3620732	3624917	So there's more news in the saga of Ubisoft.
3626007	3626827	Yes, them.
3628328	3645678	They have announced on this past Thursday that they are creating a new gaming subsidiary in conjunction with Tencent, investing $1.25 billion into it.
3646779	3654403	The subsidiary will take care of Ubisoft's longest, best-known brands of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry,
3655023	3666427	Rainbow Six, and that actually boosted their shares by like 10.3% just after the announcement.
3667147	3668228	This showed up on Friday.
3669048	3677651	But in their press release, they said, and I quote, that it will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platformed.
3678691	3695266	Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features.
3696587	3702172	So... The investment...
3705021	3710884	Actually, the new subsidiary is valued, I keep in mind this comes from a European source, at 4 billion euros.
3711784	3722969	So they're thinking that it could quadruple their sales from this range to much further on down the line.
3722989	3723029	So...
3727788	3750107	I mean this comes from being speculated from a potential sale of a company to now this and Bloomberg did report earlier that they were going to be looking into bringing in external investments in a new entity and I guess this is what it is I mean who knows we'll see what happens because of it
3752549	3755150	I feel like both could be true still.
3755310	3758030	I feel like this is priming the rest of Ubisoft to get sold.
3758490	3760251	That's what I feel like this is.
3761551	3762771	I don't entirely think so.
3763272	3763532	Fair.
3763592	3766372	I think that there's a pride issue on the line for this too.
3768693	3771174	With the Gamon family being direct investors in this whole thing?
3771394	3771854	Possibly.
3772174	3772614	Exactly.
3772754	3772954	Yeah.
3774738	3798951	but I don't know, I can't help but feel like this is the first step, and it's probably a pessimist with everything else that's been going on in the industry the last few years, and you know, I would prefer that you're correct, DarkSakura, but I just can't feel I can't help but feel like this is just priming the rest of Ubisoft to be sold but we'll see that's true alright, well something else selling right now not things GameStop, right?
3799851	3804414	yeah, promising to sell eventually, GameStop
3807175	3826880	you know i thought it's like if they can't do it with a super hyper inflated evaluation then how are they going to do it at all well they're gonna put all their money that they can into uh bitcoin and roll it all on bitcoin 1.3 billion dollars on bitcoin and how early 2024 of them
3829622	3831182	Yep.
3831483	3834543	They have $4 billion in cash reserves still.
3835304	3837464	And they're going to put it in Bitcoin.
3838645	3844406	And then it says also, you know, basically that the cryptocurrency was trading at $87,000.
3845086	3849728	And it was, you know, of course, peaked at $105,000.
3850848	3852048	No possible way it could crash.
3852768	3854009	No possible way.
3854049	3856169	This seems like a very safe bet.
3857390	3857590	And...
3859600	3863763	Yeah, I don't know, man.
3864223	3866624	I'm surprised they're still around, honestly.
3866864	3868525	I am shocked GameStop's still in business.
3868946	3869746	I'm just going to keep it real.
3869946	3871927	I am shocked that that store is still in business.
3872368	3877791	As we're watching Sears around the nation go under, what's the latest one that they started closing all the stores?
3878371	3879572	JC Macy's.
3879812	3882274	Macy's, that's right, because our big Macy's here in Sacramento.
3882294	3884635	Macy's, we just had Joanne's.
3884815	3885976	Joanne's, yes.
3886556	3904089	that's the other big one so yeah this is just like I'm I'm kind of shocked the GameStop is like holding on to be honest um you know and again I I realize there's a very a lot there's a lot of hard-working people on the front line and this is a lot of like people's first job experience yeah and like
3904509	3907793	Please, I am sorry to be such a pessimist.
3907833	3913220	This is not about you hardworking folks and all about the way these companies are mismanaged.
3913260	3917806	And nobody will tell you more about how these companies are mismanaged than those people on the front line.
3918422	3919003	No, exactly.
3919063	3919563	Yeah, for sure.
3919583	3926468	And it's it's not like, you know, I mean, back in the day, we used to complain about like pushing subscriptions and stuff like that.
3926528	3930071	It's like we know that it's not the employee that's meaning to do that.
3930151	3938878	It's it's pressure from higher ups to turn a profit in what is not a very profitable industry, at least resale wise, you know.
3939319	3942161	And I get it now with the Funko stuff that they're doing that.
3942201	3944302	But like, honestly, like I look at.
3945243	3946624	other game stores out there.
3946664	3952628	Like, for example, I went to the local retro game store yesterday to just check out.
3952688	3952968	Which one?
3952988	3953949	There's a couple of them now.
3954629	3955690	The new Fire and Ice.
3955890	3956830	I haven't been over there yet.
3956850	3957431	I need to go over there.
3957511	3963955	So Fire and Ice, they're right there by the old Cusar, but like Chuck E. Cheese, you know, and Citrus Heights.
3964015	3971400	But it's it's I think it took over like the old Pier One or Cost Plus or something.
3971420	3972500	Oh, there was a Pier One over there.
3972580	3973221	OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3973757	3974177	Yeah, yeah.
3974237	3979621	So they split it up between that and now it's like some freight tools place.
3979701	3980922	Not Harbor Freight, but something else.
3981102	3981302	Sure.
3981522	3983723	Anyways, so yeah, we went there.
3984164	3985365	Very, very nice store.
3985405	3990828	They have like tons of like new in-box retro games if you want to pay that kind of money.
3990988	3991829	Or they have like
3992429	3996252	Very nice not-inbox retro games.
3996272	4000276	They sell tons of, like, you know, magic and Pokemon cards and all that stuff.
4000676	4003999	Lots of, like, these cool signs that it looks like they custom make.
4004260	4008383	Like, these giant, like, display signs you can put into your game rooms or whatever.
4008403	4009865	So, really nice laid-out store.
4010285	4012107	That's how a game store should be.
4012247	4014168	Like, that is, like, kind of the heyday of...
4015029	4027515	GameStop and stuff like that it's like it's just a nicely laid out clean store no Funko Pops I love that idea of combining like retro video games and even do they sell current video games too or is it just retro?
4028704	4035247	Uh, I mean, they have, like, PlayStation 4 games, and so I wouldn't be surprised if they had PlayStation 5 games, but it, I mean, it looked like everything.
4035347	4043930	I love that they combined that with the concept of a physical game room and physical games, whether it be, like, the Pokemon cards or, you know, like, things you would have.
4043950	4044930	And they play games there, too.
4045050	4049012	Yeah, because now I'm like, look, I've got all this room for signage here in my office.
4049552	4051252	Now I'm like, oh, I should go over there and see what they've got.
4051493	4057415	Because I got, like, I will say, the retro one downtown, I can't remember their names, but the ones over on J Street downtown,
4058215	4061359	I did pick up a cool little... I'm pointing over here because it's on my wall over here.
4061679	4064021	It's one of those... Game Over or something like that.
4064322	4067645	The box 3D box pixel art.
4067705	4069607	I have a Castlevania scene in 3D.
4069908	4071629	And I looked for them again last time I was there.
4071649	4073772	I didn't have any, so I don't know if they just stopped...
4074792	4075612	Like a shadow box.
4075692	4076993	Yeah, it's like that.
4077493	4081034	So I was like, oh, I want to get more for other games, but they're gone from that store.
4081054	4088277	I can probably get them online somewhere, but there's something kind of fun about going in the store and seeing it for yourself, the quality in person and all of that.
4088677	4089577	It was really nice.
4089657	4101401	Honestly, I was going to get stuff, but I was like, you know, I have a whole stack of Nintendo games here that I'm not playing, and I'm maybe looking at getting a retro emulation system type thing.
4102101	4116626	and like I don't really need to buy this but they were very nice it was a lot better than like going to the the flea market out on Folsom Boulevard where I mean they're selling they're trying to sell their whole inventory for like a million dollars and it was just like unorganized yeah
4118431	4119632	I think that's who's selling.
4120472	4121833	That's the one in Denios.
4121893	4124255	Trader Dan's is the one out in Denios.
4124295	4126836	No, this is the other one.
4126956	4133981	And it's just like dirty and it's like good luck finding anything because it was just a stack of cartridges half the labels rubbed off.
4134041	4134321	It's like
4135660	4136000	Be rude.
4154265	4156548	That's it.
4156728	4160011	It looked like it felt in the weather.
4161913	4170201	It was just not... Even if you had the intention to go purchase something from them, good luck finding what you want.
4170241	4171483	Because, like I said, it was...
4172103	4173343	Not organized at all.
4173604	4175084	Like, this is all in alphabetical order.
4175324	4177885	They have clear, distinct sections for each of the things.
4178085	4181666	They sell retro games, they sell all the peripherals, all the stuff that you'd possibly need.
4182106	4189129	Like, this is very easy to find stuff, whereas that is just like someone took a bunch of them, just dumped it in a pile, maybe stacked it up, and that's it.
4189829	4191810	And, I mean, it was dirty and just gross.
4191930	4192290	It's just...
4193120	4195462	Do you remember... I'm going to do a tangent train for a minute.
4196022	4200466	My first job at a high school that I had was for a local video chain.
4200486	4202927	They don't exist anymore, so I'll say it was called Plaster TV Video.
4202947	4204128	Do you remember them, Loki?
4204469	4204629	Yes.
4204669	4205449	Plaster TV Video.
4205469	4206150	That's where I used to work.
4206190	4212374	I used to work at their flagship store in Old Town Roseville many, many, many years ago, before most of you were born.
4213655	4217758	And the thing about that store is that the owners firmly believed...
4218579	4220861	That the movie should not be organized.
4221261	4225224	That they were out there by letter and by category.
4225724	4235350	But otherwise, and it was the type of thing you had to take the box, bring it to the counter, and then little old me would go find it in the back, which was completely alphabetized by number and categorized.
4235370	4238172	It was very easy for me to find, but for you to find the movie.
4238412	4241654	And then they would have just one section that was just clumped with new releases.
4242035	4244737	These new releases, it's just go find them.
4245237	4247759	And they firmly believed that was the way to do it because
4248939	4251440	That way people can find something new to watch.
4253840	4254380	That was it.
4254520	4255421	That was their big.
4255541	4257661	This is how people find something new to watch.
4258061	4262802	Meanwhile, somebody's coming in there going, do you have a copy of Heat with Val Kilmer?
4262822	4265763	Because that was, you know, how many years ago I was working at this video store.
4266123	4268864	And I'm like, yes, I show we have one in inventory.
4269044	4269564	All right.
4270144	4272065	Let's go out and try to find the box.
4272665	4275165	There's a there's a there's somebody returning.
4275225	4277986	It is such a pain in the fucking ass anymore.
4278306	4280107	No, no, and the people would figure that out.
4280427	4283768	Just come to the counter and ask the kid behind the counter to find the damn thing for you.
4284708	4285188	Annoying.
4286029	4287249	Otherwise, it was a decent job, though.
4287269	4290890	The people there were great, and I learned a lot in the short time that I worked there, but yeah.
4292351	4296432	Yeah, so it, yeah, I don't know, like, why they would do that.
4296452	4301934	I mean, because obviously people are able to find other things in stores that are perfectly organized.
4302194	4303275	Also with this store.
4304706	4309387	So I see in chat, Bobby's like, I worked for Blockbuster and I'm sure people worked for Hollywood.
4309727	4313148	No, no, Placer TV had something that those chains didn't have.
4314168	4316169	We had the top shelf movies.
4316229	4317089	Loki's nodding.
4317429	4324111	We had the top shelf movies, which means the movies that were on top of the shelf where the kids couldn't reach them.
4324371	4325431	They weren't in a back room.
4325971	4328732	They were on the top shelf where the kids couldn't reach them.
4329996	4333337	and they were slightly bigger boxes.
4333737	4334757	That's right, kids.
4335217	4342638	We rented porn, which made more money than anything else in that store because porn releases never, never go old.
4343558	4349639	And I will say I had the unique experience of renting porn to my friend's dad.
4350420	4354740	That is the type of thing that is a memory that doesn't leave you.
4358581	4358901	Anyway.
4359940	4362463	So what are your plans for tonight?
4363084	4367550	In case any of my current friends are listening, not a friend I have talked to since grade school.
4367710	4370074	So nobody that knows me now has to worry.
4370394	4372757	This is a friend I have not talked to since grade school.
4372777	4374119	You know what?
4374139	4374359	Yeah, what?
4376279	4382560	When I was in college in my dorm, we used to just find random porn and watch it for hilarity reasons.
4382600	4387241	Just all of us, like a big group of people, just watching and riffing it the whole time.
4387661	4389401	And look, look, and I'm not shaming.
4389861	4391522	I'm not shaming people that watch porn.
4391562	4393782	Like everybody's watched porn at some point in their life.
4394542	4395582	I'm not shaming porn.
4395723	4402784	It's just when you're 18 and still learning a lot about the world, it was a very eye-opening experience.
4402844	4403764	That's all I have to say.
4406893	4410003	I think he didn't know who I was, and that was fine by me.
4410144	4411247	Alright, um...
4412699	4418980	Let's go back to the GameStop story and why they might be playing Katy Perry's The One That Got Away on loop this week.
4419800	4425961	Because we have news that the magazine that used to be a part of GameStop, Game Informer, is coming back.
4426641	4436763	That's right, an announcement on the official Game Informer Twitter, which I don't know why any respectable organization is still using Twitter, but I'm going to get off that soapbox or we'll be here for five hours tonight.
4437523	4440424	Game Informer's official Twitter has said that the...
4441644	4469498	publication is uh you know it was was shutting down and all that and then now Game Informer is actually on its way back uh on the YouTube channel is actually I'm sorry the Twitter channel that's good I thought I thought Twitter was where they announced the comeback but it's actually YouTube where they announced the comeback there's a new YouTube that uh came out that says not only is Game Informer coming back but the entire team is also going to be returning with this nice
4469878	4477744	Now, my understanding, though, is that there's a little bit of an asterisk with this that has the concern of some people.
4479006	4491916	And apparently what's happening is that the company that is jump-starting this is one that was known for getting into the business with crypto and I think it was specifically NFT games.
4492556	4496279	That's not to say they are still currently in that business, but...
4497380	4504063	It's kind of like a little bit of a stink, shall we say, that's hanging on that.
4504143	4515489	So Gunzilla Games, who developed Off the Grid, and Off the Grid was a free-to-play battle royale game that would have an NFT marketplace for purchasing and selling in-game items.
4516329	4518030	So there's just a little bit of stank.
4518791	4524214	But I do think we're at a place where the market has firmly rejected these type of games.
4525014	4530838	And so I'm also kind of like, I'm not going to play the morality police on this issue.
4531318	4534720	Because I'm for people that walk the walk and talk the talk.
4534820	4536621	And here's the thing.
4536741	4540383	You brought back Game Informer, and you didn't just zombie the brand.
4540563	4542625	You brought back the staff that made it happen.
4543385	4544826	It sounds like every single one of them.
4545347	4546507	So, fine.
4546848	4549630	If you made that type of investment, I hope it pays off for you.
4549690	4563420	Because I would rather see that type of investment pay off for a company than the NFT, you know, all that garbage that we just don't... It was not going to be good for our industry and has been soundly rejected.
4564100	4564221	So...
4566147	4567588	Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
4567608	4569288	The Digital Archive is back.
4569348	4570228	There's new articles.
4570268	4571148	There's new reviews.
4571829	4574809	And the magazine will be revived later this year.
4574949	4575970	And I think that's pretty exciting.
4576070	4577930	And you won't have to walk into a GameStop to get it.
4580171	4584132	Yeah, Mike Defton Chat says, Crypto Bros are funding this and I really don't like that.
4584252	4588333	I just hope they let Game Informer run their stuff like they used to and keeps their hand away.
4588753	4590673	That's where I'm at.
4590693	4590813	Again,
4594833	4601989	I think a more morally gray company would have bought the name and hired cheaper people to do it
4603015	4607316	And if we're going to talk about companies doing wrong things, we should talk about companies doing right things.
4608036	4621680	And I think when the company hires the original staff and brings this back in a manner that I think we can all agree is the way we can bring it back, I'm willing to overlook the company's past mistakes as long as we stay on this positive road we're on.
4622220	4626281	Let's stay on this positive journey together and everything will be cool.
4628544	4656170	but S. Joe and Hunter Matt says worries me that if the parent company feels they're not getting a return on the investment they'll force them to ram in the NFT crypto stuff which is now what GameStops ended up doing essentially but I mean the market has already rejected this the gaming gamer fans as a whole has rejected this and I know somebody's gonna DM me going but Rob what about that store marketplace but very few people are turning a profit off that stuff
4657552	4661154	Ask some of our friends we used to podcast with how the NFT thing has gone for them.
4669477	4672319	Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out nothing about the GI vault.
4673099	4674159	No, nothing about that either.
4674940	4680682	So yeah, DJ Ranma S says crypto bros are bringing back a magazine, bringing back the staff and doing something good.
4680762	4682143	I feel it failed to see the issue here.
4682183	4686385	Yes, we are hoping that our crypto bros have found a better path forward.
4687304	4710718	and that is to be celebrated all right uh let's move on yes I believe DarkSakura's next yeah and uh well it's another bit of layoff news because of course it is I mean who here likes Myst or or Riven
4713146	4713726	I love it.
4713866	4713966	Yeah.
4714006	4716528	I mean, I've never played all time class.
4716588	4732235	I mean, Myst is like the I mean, it's it's one of it's always picked for these Hall of Fame's most influential, greatest of all time of its era for a reason, you know, and yeah.
4732455	4732635	Yeah.
4733743	4737925	The developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff by half.
4739186	4741387	Although, I mean, it is 12 people.
4742128	4744309	But that is roughly half of their team.
4745250	4752253	Because apparently they said they were forced into a tricky spot.
4753434	4759742	where they were not able to cover costs.
4760202	4762525	I'm actually going to read.
4763106	4771195	Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025.
4772917	4780925	Throughout the past year, we have been ultra transparent with the entire Scion team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead.
4781646	4787792	While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was and is still deeply saddening for all of us.
4788833	4789093	Yeah.
4789273	4792797	We have done our best to pad the landing for those affected with severance packages.
4792957	4797021	We would implore any fellow developers looking for world-class talent to reach out.
4798740	4801321	Yeah, this actually seems pretty sincere.
4801421	4802041	No, it does.
4802141	4812464	And I think maybe because it is a smaller studio and as much as this news sucks, you feel a little bit more, let's say, humanity in this than a lot of the game layoff news we've had from larger corporations.
4812984	4816825	So while this news sucks and I'm not going to sugarcoat that.
4817365	4821448	at least they have been fairly transparent throughout this process and so forth.
4821508	4833496	And I think, you know, that's what we as fans who support these companies look for these companies to do is to, you know, keep doing that right thing for these people that they do unfortunately have to let go.
4833976	4846805	But I understand, like, you know, Cyan, I believe the latest things they published were VR versions of Myst and Riven, which while that sounds really cool and I actually would like to try that because those games are epic,
4847986	4850109	I'm not sure maybe VR took off.
4850289	4853434	To me, that sounds like they kind of hedged some bets in VR.
4853934	4858240	And this is not me poo-pooing VR because I understand people are doing amazing things in VR.
4858540	4864388	But the reality is, it's not adopting, especially right now, amongst gamer fans.
4864969	4865309	DarkSakura
4891636	4902328	Well, more to the point of the layoffs, and Bobby pointed this out in chat, that their follow-up post had the 12 people listed and how to contact them for hiring.
4904352	4904913	With permission.
4905113	4907195	Truly, they are doing their best for that.
4907635	4910918	But I mean, we're coming just for the first quarter of 2025.
4911378	4916001	That's about 1,200 game developers losing their jobs.
4916722	4920205	This is coming from about 14,600 in 2024 and 10,500 in 2023.
4920245	4923587	Of course, that doesn't include people who might have been rehired or hired by other places.
4923627	4924288	But I'm just saying it's
4934887	4935207	It's there.
4935227	4936148	It's there.
4959989	4986517	just you wait and that's why I'm worried about this Ghibli which without going down that whole rabbit hole that's what has me worried about this Ghiblification thing that's going on right now and how many people that don't really know the nuances of this are really buying into that that's a very dangerous thing that's happening if I I think this is not the sort of thing that would make Miyazaki happy
4987541	4991364	No, in fact, he said as much in 2017 or something.
4991424	4997288	He made a comment on the AI that was not complex because he's making the rounds again because people are attributing it as a current quote.
4997348	4997708	It's not.
4997748	5001450	It's an old quote, but I'm sure his position has not changed.
5001510	5003732	It has only intensified after what happened this week.
5004292	5007635	I would not be surprised if there was legal action.
5008795	5011017	To me, that's going to have to happen.
5012458	5016801	Studio Ghibli kind of needs to sue OpenAI and that needs to play out.
5017541	5022067	It's clearly that they've trained it off of their material illegally.
5022307	5025011	Clearly, that's what happened.
5025651	5029716	Now that you say this, it actually is...
5031631	5038494	There are some experts saying that there is grounds to take legal action against OpenAI.
5040635	5042916	So, yeah.
5043036	5047859	And in fact, hold on, I just read something about this.
5047919	5049119	It was posted a couple days ago.
5052176	5064264	The former general counsel at TV Channel Showtime and AI expert Rob Rosenberg, Ghibli may actually be able to take legal action against open AI over the situation, even though it is a complex question.
5064664	5073791	This is related to the Lanham Act from 1946, having to do the primary federal statute governing trademark law in the U.S.,
5074471	5090763	So they could argue that converting user photos to Ghibli style OpenAI is trading off the goodwill of Ghibli's trademarks and using Ghibli's identifiable style and leading to a likelihood of confusion among consumers that this function is endorsed or licensed by Studio Ghibli.
5092485	5108333	S2 and Hunter Matt in chat says it may be a fight in court but it's worth the fight 100% this is how we need to redirect AI to stay in its fucking lane and as I've said time and time again AI great when it's a tool terrible when it's a replacement for art those are two very different things
5109529	5118634	New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI as well, and they requested for the case to be thrown out, and a federal judge denied them.
5120275	5126558	So there are a lot of big ones out there.
5126678	5130941	Meta has been accused of illegally downloading pirated books to train AIs.
5131801	5132781	Yeah, that one's nice.
5133202	5136763	I like how they're like, oh, well, we shouldn't be punished for all that stuff.
5137603	5143765	You guys were suing folks $100,000 for downloading 1MB3.
5143805	5146146	They need to be sued to oblivion.
5146266	5149287	And fucking tired of the lack of accountability in this country.
5150528	5157250	I will also, though, point out that there is a cease and desist letter that's floating around from Studio Ghibli and it is false.
5157690	5158150	It's fake.
5159691	5159771	Um...
5161366	5166650	But, yeah, it's not homage.
5166950	5168451	It is art theft.
5168692	5171193	This is going to court somehow.
5171253	5177618	If the Ghibli thing doesn't because it gets complicated with international stuff, this will go to court one way or the other.
5177778	5178319	Just you wait.
5179380	5180881	I will throw this out here, though.
5182562	5189567	ChatGTP is blocking those AI-generated Ghibli art pieces.
5190067	5190548	Quote art.
5191087	5192468	Hmm, interesting.
5192889	5194090	So, there is that.
5195771	5200015	Anyway, not meaning to go off on the tangent there, but it is worth mentioning.
5200115	5205820	No, it's absolutely worth mentioning when you look at things from an industry perspective and why these layoffs happen.
5205920	5213407	So, you know, as much as this news sucks with Cyan, they're doing everything right for this difficult process.
5213467	5218131	And then when you look at these other big companies that just seem to have no heart whatsoever,
5218411	5220612	why they're laying people off, how they're laying people off.
5220813	5222213	It's such a contrast.
5222374	5226796	No wonder it's so ego-reducing in the industry.
5227977	5233880	I would say if you're going to want to look, by the way, back to those updates about Ghibli, look to NHK.
5234901	5240184	They're pretty much the ones who've been getting the quotes and the news on it directly from the company.
5240704	5242245	Okay.
5242385	5243166	Let's move on.
5243246	5245067	We're going to go to another story from Loki.
5245087	5245207	Okay.
5246257	5246457	Yep.
5247158	5266473	So along the same lines of where, you know, some of the stuff in the industry is pivoting the wrong way, Sony has kind of done that in the past with some of this push to make a ton of live service games and then having to walk that all back after, of course, Concord completely bombed and everything.
5267434	5272518	But we had an interesting comment from ex-PlayStation boss Sean Layden saying,
5273198	5273999	Thank you for watching!
5293000	5317752	all that's considered it seemed to be a good time to step down after 32 years at Sony so it sounds like they were pushing to move this into the live service stuff and it's just like I'm not inspired to make anything within that space it's kind of putting pressure on the creatives at the company so yep
5320098	5320658	Interesting.
5321698	5323359	Because of live service stuff.
5323519	5323779	Yeah.
5324659	5330400	That's a heck of a way to kind of see what's coming and make moves appropriately.
5330600	5332541	I wonder how many people are doing this because of AI.
5332561	5334621	It's interesting.
5336501	5337282	It is interesting.
5338022	5339722	I don't know what else to say about it, so I'm going to move on.
5340502	5346703	Let's talk about the Multiverses developers, which unfortunately, as we all know, Multiverses has got the plug pulled, essentially.
5347143	5348304	They're on their last season.
5350333	5356278	Apparently, Player First, which was the team behind Multiverses before, you know, Warner Brothers got to Warner Brothers.
5356959	5362724	Apparently, they were going to be working on – this comes through a podcast.
5362884	5367608	It's one of these whole – once associated with Warner Brothers, San Diego and all this.
5368488	5370510	So anyway, the podcast was Sacred Symbols.
5371071	5375555	So I don't know how much this is hearsay or direct knowledge, but I would believe this.
5376215	5376595	Mm-hmm.
5376616	5376856	Mm-hmm.
5399159	5417677	Apparently, also the source on this podcast, the host Colin Moriarty for Sacred Symbols, said there was quite a lot of animosity internally from people that worked on the game, who felt it was profoundly unfair that their sister team, Player First, got to launch multiverses twice while they never got a shot to launch at all.
5418057	5418878	Hmm, interesting.
5420157	5439298	but it should be pointed out Mario Kart clones are nothing new and some of them have actually done very well I think we all kind of liked Sega's All-Star Racing I'm pretty sure they've had their own with the Adventure Time and stuff they had Cartoon Network Racing was a game years ago making something a little more Mario Kart 8 yeah
5440940	5446484	How about this, Warner Brothers and studios that are employed by Warner Brothers?
5446624	5449606	Stop trying to copy everybody else's games and make your own original games.
5450086	5452808	You wonder why you can't have a successful game.
5452868	5455229	It's because you're trying to crib off of everybody else.
5455550	5457091	Come up with something unique yourself.
5458134	5459054	Here's the thing for me.
5459574	5460935	Multiverses wasn't bad.
5462255	5467817	No, it's not bad, but it's clear where the inspiration's drawn from.
5467877	5475139	We have Disney Speedstorm, which is the same thing, but it's Disney, and I think it's doing pretty well, and I see friends on Twitch that stream that.
5475780	5479361	I think DreamWorks has one, too, called All-Star Kart Racing, although I'm not sure.
5479981	5481481	Yeah, they have the DreamWorks.
5481521	5483222	That's pretty old by this point.
5483542	5489464	And then, of course, you know, if it's true we're getting Mario Kart 9... Hey, Garfield Kart, let's not forget Garfield Kart.
5489864	5492805	I forgot about Garfield Kart.
5493506	5501849	If it's true we're getting Mario Kart 9 or 10, depending on where you count Mario Kart Tour with this or not, you know, with that being announced...
5502769	5504891	Almost definitely next week.
5505031	5509194	That would have probably really taken the wins out of any type of sales of this sort of game.
5509214	5517299	And honestly, it's something that Speedstorm and the others need to be aware of is that with a legit new Mario Kart title imminent, that's going to be huge.
5517319	5520561	But it's not to say you can't have more than one successful kart racing game.
5521241	5524103	Some of the others that aren't live service games are cute.
5524203	5528646	I was at a party where some friends were playing Crash Racing just the other day.
5528927	5529627	Crash Racing?
5529747	5532589	is great, Sonic, Sega, Racing, All-Stars.
5532609	5536452	Bring me back Chocobo Racing without all that bullshit.
5538554	5541015	That should be the addition, without all that bullshit addition.
5541576	5548321	Which I think technically the game I think exists is that now, but it's it's so it's too late, exactly.
5548361	5549802	And now it's like that's never coming back.
5549822	5552444	That was our chance was that game and
5553749	5553989	Womp.
5554991	5557454	So I guess we have the Sonic thing to look forward to.
5557695	5561620	And of course, Mario Kart 9 or 10, which I'll finally know the actual name next week.
5562561	5562822	All right.
5563963	5570633	Well, while I think about upcoming games, DarkSakura is going to take a minute in our next segment to talk about old games.
5581400	5588724	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5589164	5591826	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5592186	5598970	And Jamie, with the Classic Game of the Week, you're on a roll with some bangers right now, some modern day classics.
5599010	5601071	I'm assuming everything's turning 10 this month.
5602341	5607465	Yeah, but I mean, I was a little bit just taken aback by this.
5607505	5609786	And actually, this is 11 years we're looking at.
5609886	5610627	Oh, geez.
5610847	5611387	Oh, my God.
5612208	5612909	I feel so old.
5612949	5613689	All right.
5613749	5614650	What is the classic game?
5615430	5623216	And while the creator of the series can be very problematic, I did pick Five Nights at Freddy's.
5625422	5637848	It is a point-and-click survival horror game that was developed and published by Scott Cawthorn, where you play as a character named Mike Schmidt, who is a security guard at a pizzeria.
5638668	5647252	And he has to basically guard the place and keep from being murdered by the animatronics that live there, or exist there, I should say.
5648892	5649493	Yeah.
5650253	5658077	So at any rate, it was actually developed as a result of criticism.
5659338	5662819	So he had created a game called Chipper and Son's Lumber Company.
5663239	5672103	And it said that even though it was supposed to be a family-friendly game, the characters were unintentionally frightening and had unnatural movement.
5672303	5675044	So he's like, well, if that's what it is, then that's what we're doing.
5675624	5683367	So six months it took using the Clickbait... Sorry, Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game engine.
5683907	5687989	It was released on Windows through Desura on August 8th.
5689650	5691512	2014, and then through Steam on August 18th.
5692113	5695417	And then there were, of course, later versions that came out.
5696819	5699101	And it received pretty positive reviews.
5699181	5701284	It was considered frightening and distinct.
5701844	5706270	The atmosphere, sound, gameplay, and of course lots of jump-scare
5707839	5710181	Opportunity, at least.
5711381	5722788	And I think what really pushed its popularity were the let's play videos and just the big kind of cult following that it got.
5723249	5734856	I mean, it has led to fan games and sequels and books and a movie, which I honestly, I tried to watch some of the movie and I didn't think what I watched of it sucked too badly.
5735902	5750808	but anyway so you are the guard, Mike Schmidt and you are guarding Freddy Fazbear's Pizza you have to finish your shift and it lasts from midnight to 6am without being killed, you know, should be easy at any other job, not this one
5751748	5779601	um so you have almost nothing in the way of defenses you have to sit in the office and you have security cameras that let you monitor the place and then you have like I guess a set battery level in doors you can open and close um and you can turn on lights here and there um and yeah like I said you've also got the steel doors to keep the the characters from opening and from coming and going um
5781803	5809700	and if you don't prevent them from entering the office they will attack and kill you with a big jump scare and it's game over so um and it's like basically each of the levels is like one night it's about 10 minutes and then if Freddy Fazbear shows up then you hear the Toreador song you know uh anyway um for the March of the Toreadors um
5811684	5814465	Not to be confused with Vampire, the Masquerade people.
5815525	5815825	Nerds.
5816326	5817366	Wait, I'm the one that came up with that.
5817386	5817666	Never mind.
5818246	5826009	Anyway, so you have a higher difficulty each night.
5826549	5828869	And then you have basically six levels.
5828889	5831370	You have the five main nights and the extra sixth night.
5831710	5833071	I'm getting to the other bit.
5834071	5854641	so basically you listen to voicemails from his predecessor at the job that explains the story that there were the animatronics Freddy, Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy have to become mobile at night or their servo motors will lock up if they're left off too long and they said he was like
5855241	5880148	you know make sure you keep yourself safe or you lock them up or they will mistake humans for an animatronic endoskeleton and have to put them inside a mechanical suit which of course would kill the player it talks about this thing called the bite of 87 where apparently a person lost their frontal lobe and were forced into the animatronic
5881308	5905688	um there there's all kind of other stuff you know about a murder case for five children um it's it's pretty pretty brutal um and then the fourth night there's a voicemail that implies that the previous employee was killed by an animatronic while he was recording it the fifth night has a message that's nothing but garbled sound and then you get your paycheck after the fifth and sixth night
5906488	5913694	After the sixth night, you're given access to a seventh custom night where you can change the AI difficulty of the animatronics.
5914615	5916636	After you finish the seventh night, you get fired.
5918217	5918838	Isn't that great?
5920219	5920819	What a twist.
5923041	5923261	Yeah.
5924442	5928205	So... It's foreshadowing the game industry.
5929306	5930887	You do well, you get fired.
5930927	5932208	But anyway...
5937040	5951641	The point with the game is that, like, I mean, keep in mind all those other games were like Christian-oriented family whatever games, and this is a horror game that does not have set violence in it.
5952381	5971634	no gore, no blood lots of talks about it, lots of hints to it but it uses that psychological factor to create the fear without it being graphically violent and a reviewer for Game Revolution said it was the most terrifying game he'd ever played um
5972895	5974916	There are, of course, other versions.
5975276	5982221	There was the Windows via Desura, there was the Steam version, and then the version for Android and iOS came out.
5982801	5987164	Windows Phone, there's been versions for Switch, PS4, and Xbox One.
5987224	5988885	Those three came out November 29th, 2019.
5992288	6001594	The mechanics were considered well-designed, and it was like... I like the comparison of a game of red light, green light, but very lethal.
6002234	6004875	Sound design was, I always thought the sound design was really good.
6005855	6006656	How Squid Game.
6008837	6009197	Huh?
6009217	6011057	You said red light, green light, but very lethal.
6011097	6012218	And I said, how Squid Game.
6013658	6014659	Well, this predates Squid Game.
6014779	6015699	I know, I know, but still.
6016839	6017580	Yeah.
6018120	6028924	But anyway, there's a quote from Touch Arcade that said the game challenged players by forcing them to yield to their own paranoia.
6029983	6034029	I think that is a very good way to describe it.
6040457	6042180	Basically, instead of having...
6043874	6047596	The jump scares, you know, just be a thing that's just there.
6048536	6051938	It's more of the possibility of one that scares you.
6052759	6059322	Some people think it was too reliant on the jump scares, but I kind of, it's more of the anticipation of it.
6059382	6061023	You know it's coming, right?
6063318	6081535	but it has been just featured by some of the biggest influencers out there it was the adaptation in 2017 for the film it was the novel Five Nights at Freddy's The Silver Eyes they're just all kinds of stuff I mean they're
6083271	6089275	There was that controversy about Cawthorn and his donations, which we won't get into.
6090176	6095780	But he's done a statement that he intended to pass on the management of the franchise to another party.
6097201	6101684	And then, of course, this franchise has been subject to all sorts of theories.
6102805	6103646	All kinds of stuff.
6103946	6110491	And, I mean, a lot of the fanbase really did get this negative reputation for being toxic.
6111465	6114247	but still super influential.
6115487	6117629	Lots of fan games that were made around it.
6119770	6120691	Some published on...
6123115	6149784	Game Jolt and it made them create an entire video game category dedicated to it there's just all kinds of stuff I'm not going to go into a lot of details but there was different artists doing music around the lore including the Living Tombstone and their song was featured in the closing credit sequence of the film so there you go
6151525	6154528	I remember going to your place and watching, what was it, the sequel?
6154589	6155730	The second one with the kid?
6155970	6158032	Yeah, I think this was something Shane forced me to play.
6158333	6160795	And I'm just not a fan of these games.
6160975	6163398	And I want to be very clear.
6164539	6166702	For people that are into them, I get it.
6167102	6190187	and like I understand why they are big games especially with younger folks because this is a horror game that's kind of safe for kids because there's not a lot of blood a lot of it is very implied sort of things you know but for me it is it's completely a game made out of jump scares which is my least favorite game in a video game that's why I don't like Mori's in Dead by Daylight you know that oh really
6191573	6216796	yeah because they just there's just something that sets them off in my head I get the same reaction to them as I do from a jump scare for me it's not the Moris that bother me because I know they're coming for that but it's it's I cannot stand cannot stand going against Trapper and Ghostface because of the jump scares that's that's what gets me Myers for me
6217941	6223325	Myers, I feel like the way that Myers has to play is like, I don't get jump scared as much.
6223545	6224785	But yeah, I get it.
6224966	6227747	Yeah, a good Myers is gonna be a jump scare.
6227947	6228868	Yeah, no, I get that.
6228908	6229288	I get that.
6229448	6230749	That's if you're gonna be moving.
6230769	6232330	My MMR is not high enough for that.
6233631	6238875	And I don't even mind being jump scared in DBD because like, I have a scream and laugh about it.
6239475	6245339	But not for I prefer a jump scare when I have zero anticipation of it happening.
6246394	6259541	It's the things that I anticipate, as in what it is in Five Nights or with the Moris, that I just get this feeling of discomfort.
6260101	6261942	And I know they're not supposed to be happy.
6262602	6265244	You know Shay, she loves a Mori.
6265984	6266905	But me?
6269126	6269486	No.
6270266	6271367	I don't even like doing them.
6272455	6281689	Yeah, and that's why for so long in DBD, I stuck to playing killer because when I was in control of the jump scares, it was fine.
6281709	6283291	You don't really get jump scared as a killer.
6284032	6286375	And I actually love playing as Ghostface.
6287917	6289358	So it's kind of ironic.
6289458	6295600	I mean, I actually like I hate that it's not as easy to photobomb a Ghostface Mori.
6296300	6303082	I love how Five Nights at Freddy's turned into Dead by Daylight because that's literally one of the next DLCs coming out.
6303596	6304798	I think I was in that category.
6318337	6323382	I understand the problematic creator.
6324463	6330369	I'm glad that it sounds like some of the money is getting distanced a little bit through another agency.
6332891	6336174	Unfortunately, there's going to be problematic people all over the games industry.
6336795	6340276	If you're going to dodge problematic people, there's a lot of games you're going to be dodging.
6340416	6340636	A lot.
6340656	6342036	You're going to have very little left to play.
6343417	6353299	You know, and even, like, I think about, like, Loki plays Minecraft every single week, and we all know that the original creator of Minecraft is a gigantic douche canoe, and thankfully he has nothing to do with this.
6353659	6358620	He has nothing to do with the series anymore, but still, you know, it just stinks.
6358680	6361941	I just imagine someone going down the river in a giant Massengill bottle.
6363021	6363502	Summer's Eve.
6365242	6389618	While singing, of course Floating down the river I'm going to take a tiny tangent here and I'll tell you why I like the word douche as an insult for guys Okay, please Because a douche is something that actively causes harm to a woman's body And I think it's highly appropriate to use that for men who cause harm to a woman's body Or anybody's body
6392216	6392636	Think about it.
6392696	6393076	Fair enough.
6393916	6394157	All right.
6394737	6401959	Let's move on and talk about some other headlines in the gaming industry rapidly in a segment we call, appropriately, Rapid Fire News.
6402159	6402419	Loki.
6403779	6403979	Yes.
6404760	6412962	So I know this is going to come as a big sad for you guys, but Hogwarts Legacy isn't getting its DLC it's supposed to have gotten.
6413622	6415843	Apparently, its expansion has been canceled.
6416723	6418023	Oh, that's sad.
6418203	6419164	Oh, she passed away?
6419604	6420204	Oh, all right.
6421468	6425251	Hey, remember, one day we will read her obituary.
6426412	6428374	Sure, making games on a different intellectual property.
6428394	6428674	Great idea.
6428694	6429975	Maybe pick a good one.
6445262	6450306	Anyway, I want to point out that I'm drinking this iced coffee that's Girl Scout.
6450687	6454610	They say coconut caramel, but I prefer the other cookie factory that still calls them Samoas.
6456231	6458173	I'm drinking this Girl Scout flavored iced coffee.
6458233	6462917	And you think this has all the makings of like literal gay power in a can.
6462977	6467301	It's iced coffee, cookies, but it's only okay.
6467961	6468702	It's only okay.
6469523	6470503	How much sugar is in it?
6471204	6472065	That's like at 15 carbs, 13 carbs.
6475353	6475853	I meant sugar.
6475913	6476875	Oh, actual sugars.
6477035	6477656	Total sugars.
6477876	6478177	10 grams.
6479619	6479819	Oh, not bad.
6479839	6480299	Yeah, it could be worse.
6480320	6482262	It's still mostly coffee.
6482302	6484686	Of course, you know the coffee queen wants you to share, Rob.
6486688	6487109	Coffee.
6489172	6489632	Dan.
6489913	6489973	Uh...
6492700	6503886	We also got news that to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Undertale, they're going to be having a live orchestra performing the Undertale soundtrack in London.
6505047	6509389	The event called the Determination Symphony is going to be held June 22nd.
6509589	6511110	You can get your tickets now.
6515012	6517974	I should probably put Megalovania back as my ringtone.
6519622	6532611	But mine was the Homestuck, one of the Homestuck versions Speaking of live concert symphony things I bought tickets to go see Dear Friends Is Dear Friends going to be in Sacramento?
6533411	6533952	Sacramento!

6536654	6541497	Because you're a grown-ass person, you get a portrait Why didn't you tell me?
6541537	6547741	Dear Friends, buy your own I literally saw it on an Instagram ad last week And so it was November 1st is the day
6550720	6573653	so you should go we can all we can we can they're not sold out they still have a ways to go uh we can do a dinner beforehand that would be fun yes dinner the last time i went to one of those concerts with you was in san francisco that was a long time ago long time ago i'm just excited because apparently 16 music is in the rotation now that's what i really want to hear so
6575985	6577826	Imagine if Ben Starr went on tour with them.
6577927	6578307	He won't.
6578427	6578687	He won't.
6578727	6580428	He's way too booked and blessed in other areas.
6580648	6584651	Which, by the way, that Expedition 33 game, hype, hype, hype.
6584771	6586092	I really hope that game isn't bad.
6587173	6588294	I really want that game to be good.
6588634	6589655	Really want that game to be good.
6590515	6592537	Shay, it's the Dear Friends concert.
6592617	6593938	It's Final Fantasy music.
6594338	6595299	Yeah, with an orchestra.
6595539	6596840	So it's fine.
6597000	6598422	It's a fancy night.
6598482	6599843	It's a night at the opera.
6600323	6601204	Except it's not opera.
6601224	6601544	Fancy.
6601985	6602625	Fancy.
6602845	6603806	It's Fancy Feast.
6604267	6604527	All right.
6605407	6607529	Anyway, who are we on?
6607569	6608190	Are we on Jamie?
6608230	6609131	Yeah, we're on Jamie's story.
6610765	6610945	Huh?
6611286	6611886	Didn't I just?
6611986	6612547	Rapid fire.
6612867	6613227	Never mind.
6613868	6614969	How about Tetris?
6616230	6616791	Tetris.
6617471	6617711	Sure.
6617731	6618112	That's you.
6618232	6620114	You want to switch?
6620154	6620334	Sure.
6620374	6624498	I'm like, I don't even know why I pulled that up because shit happens, maybe?
6624818	6625138	It's fine.
6625238	6627100	Okay, because I was like, why do I have a Tetris story?
6627260	6630903	Anyway, live radio!
6631804	6632345	SAG-AFTRA
6633311	6637134	They have made a statement.
6637214	6646022	They represent 160,000 media professionals, including voiceover artists, and they have two new agreements.
6646182	6650526	The Student Interactive Waiver Agreement and the Game Jam Waiver Agreement.
6651567	6659694	Those agreements provide video game developers at every stage of their careers the opportunity to work with union performers, even as the video game strike continues.
6660735	6665217	So this is basically so students can hire professional voice actors for their games.
6665737	6666197	That's great.
6666438	6668899	That should be a bridge that's easy.
6668959	6675822	It's kind of one of those things you wouldn't have thought would have got left out before, but obviously SAG-AFTRA's beef is not with students and people up and coming.
6675862	6677062	It's with large corporations.
6677302	6678363	So this is great.
6678503	6678763	Great news.
6678783	6682825	And it works with them to help them satisfy course requirements during game developments.
6683345	6683545	So...
6684085	6708520	I think that's pretty awesome and of course like you said I don't think AI is going to enter into it they do have that the participants have to sign the project to the appropriate agreement also the big thing is that provided that the game the project does not generate revenue oh interesting okay
6710639	6718161	Wait, does that mean if we did another game jam here at VOG Network that Bobby can make Flappy Bird with SAG-AFTRA actors?
6719941	6721181	Or Flappy VOG, excuse me.
6721621	6724762	If Bobby goes back to school for game design, then yes.
6725942	6727862	He could take a class at a community college.
6731643	6735364	All right, well, this might shock you, but I have a story about Tetris.
6737855	6738175	What?
6738395	6742479	And yes, it's that Tetris game that I know many of you are looking forward to.
6742659	6746383	It is Tetris the Grandmaster 4, Absolute Eye.
6746403	6750407	I'm really surprised there's a story about Tetris.
6750487	6751828	I know nobody would ever ruin that.
6752088	6752549	I'm just kidding.
6752869	6753309	It doesn't matter.
6754230	6755111	I just happened to find out.
6775446	6777627	It'll be 3,900 yen if you live over there.
6777727	6779748	So yes, this is Tetris the Grandmaster.
6780248	6782108	It was first in arcades in August of 98.
6782729	6787550	Then there was Grandmaster 2 in 2000, Grandmaster 3, Terror Instinct in 2005.
6788031	6791112	And yes, the rights have been obtained.
6791552	6793032	Everything is lined up.
6793272	6796714	And now we're getting a brand new Grandmaster game this week.
6797274	6798234	What game modes?
6798674	6799855	How can we possibly...
6800635	6802076	Do more with Tetris, you ask?
6802116	6803757	Well, you have Marathon Mode.
6804177	6805878	I mean, it's not Tetris without a Marathon Mode.
6806159	6807299	You have Normal Mode.
6808540	6810081	Also, you know, kind of important.
6810441	6815745	Asuka Mode, which is for intermediate players where Tetriminos drop at top speed.
6815845	6818446	So you better be fast, ho, to clear that.
6818486	6819807	It's actually in the press release.
6820087	6822069	Asuka Mode?
6822829	6823249	No, it's not.
6823710	6828893	It must be the character they were showing in the video there, Asuka.
6829153	6830214	Yeah.
6830254	6831935	There's also a backstep function.
6831975	6835777	You can rewind if you need to replace a Tetromino.
6836257	6836877	Master.
6837598	6838038	That's right.
6838098	6844762	You can show that you are a master baiter in Tetris where advanced players will put all Tetris skills to the test.
6845482	6849084	You level up a bunch and Tetrominos drop at maximum speed right away.
6849144	6851025	It sounds like it's similar, but there is no rewind.
6851725	6853126	T-spins, all clears.
6853306	6854047	You better be good.
6855147	6856088	Uh, Kohona Mode.
6856669	6857710	Big blocks.
6857750	6859811	That's actually what's on the screen right now for our Twitch viewers.
6860252	6861353	Big blocks.
6861813	6864556	This is bringing Duplos to a Lego match.
6864796	6866557	It's big, big blocks.
6867178	6873183	Every time you get an all clear, you get a bonus illustration, such as this lovely anime person playing a guitar.
6873323	6874024	Isn't that lovely?
6874945	6879749	Early on, you get a guide to help you, and then when you pull them off, you get visuals.
6879949	6880269	Cute.
6881490	6886574	and then Shiranui, I hope I'm saying this right, where you face off against CPU opponents.
6887474	6890777	And I'm sure they are going to give you hell in this game.
6891257	6892578	So enjoy that.
6893618	6893819	What?
6894999	6896300	Wait, you said Shiranui?
6896340	6899963	That's like a ghost story.
6900803	6905726	Well, anyway, I know many of you already have this on your wish list for Steam and you're ready to go for this week.
6905746	6906307	It's an optical illusion.
6907443	6911327	I'm a whore for puzzle games and I love Tetris, so I'm going to pick this up too.
6911427	6912888	I don't know a lot about Grandmaster.
6912948	6915490	I've just heard it is hard as hell.
6916611	6917092	Yes, it is.
6917132	6917492	You're correct.
6917532	6922717	Yes, because it's based on the Sega game that was... Not necessarily Grandmaster, maybe the Grand Bastard.
6925099	6927841	Anyway... And don't forget about the other mode though, Rob.
6928062	6928242	What?
6929343	6932085	There's Master of Puppets mode where it plays nothing but Metallica.
6932105	6932365	There you go.
6932385	6932766	Perfect.
6932806	6933246	Perfect.
6933687	6937209	Well, actually, with it being on Steam, it's very easy to minimize the music in that game.
6937790	6941293	Do you know how often I love to do Diablo 4 with Enya music?
6942013	6943154	One of my favorite things.
6943214	6944315	Slaying demons to Enya?
6945016	6945396	Brilliance.
6945917	6946497	I am 100% serious.
6946537	6949600	Are you sure that that doesn't promote bowel movements?
6950700	6950881	No.
6951581	6952242	Not in this house.
6953579	6954940	Alright, moving on.
6955281	6958103	We're going to travel around the world and check out some other games you can play this week.
6958163	6961386	Not just Tetris the Grandmaster, but Loki, what's coming out in the US?
6962367	6968172	Not much, because remember, we're past the end of the financial year now, and everybody's taking a break.
6969130	6971112	So, we only have four games this week.
6971132	6972072	For some companies.
6972192	6973874	Some companies end the financial year.
6973894	6974694	Some end it in June.
6975515	6977697	Most, yeah, most end it now.
6977817	6978397	But, anyways.
6979218	6984662	So, we have Korya, which is coming out on PC and PlayStation 5.
6985283	6992989	Croc, The Legend of Gabos on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
6993869	7000778	Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, Fuel Brothers Tonosama No.
7001478	7011711	1 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and finally Tetris The Grandmaster 4 Absolute Eye on PC.
7014005	7014305	That's it.
7040478	7041759	Oh, that sounds like Shane's jam.
7041799	7042920	I wonder if he knows about this game.
7043381	7046744	But yeah, you explore and solve the hidden secrets of the hospital.
7046884	7048245	Oh no, not a scary hospital.
7049446	7052729	Scholar's Mate, that's coming out this week in Japan on the PlayStation 5.
7052789	7063819	Otherwise, it's empty on the Switch, which is kind of surprising, but maybe because we had that release of Saga Frontier 2 that just came out of nowhere, so maybe there's some other things there.
7064920	7065901	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
7067202	7067722	Some stuff.
7068463	7068883	No, really.
7069344	7078652	We have on the 31st, we have Sultan's Game for PC, also Wild Keepers Rising, Post Trauma for PC, PS5, Xboxes.
7079392	7082054	There's an undated game called Screaming in the Basement.
7082134	7083295	I really want to know what that is.
7085641	7092088	Moving on into April, on the first is Koita for PC, PS5, Niff Niff for PC and Switch.
7092709	7095152	On the second, Elroy and the Aliens for PC.
7095432	7097755	On the third, The Last of Us Part II Remastered.
7098836	7105924	Pinball FX VR for MetaQuest, Sand for PC, Echo Beach for PC, and that's it.
7108300	7111702	Sorry, now the chat is talking about my Enya Diablo thing.
7111762	7112223	I'm sorry.
7112403	7114444	S2100Matt just put the best idea in my head.
7115145	7119128	Tiger Claw is talking about trance remixes of Enya music, which I never even knew was a thing.
7119248	7121329	But this being the internet, of course it's a thing.
7122110	7123951	I've never thought to seek that out before.
7124051	7125652	And now, of course, Rule 34.
7125732	7127093	It exists somewhere, right?
7127553	7128634	So I'll have to seek that out.
7128714	7129094	However...
7130075	7133478	S200 Matt wins with this comment saying, forget the original soundtrack.
7133858	7137521	Gotta call that 90s infomercial and get the Pure Moods CD.
7138201	7138802	Oh, perfect.
7138842	7142905	Now look, I haven't, oh my god, I'm already hearing Enigma in my head.
7143645	7145466	It's the return to innocence.
7146007	7147348	Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7148510	7176812	like every fucking I know I fucking I unironically loved Enigma in the 90s like all their original CDs are fucking great their third album was extremely underrated with Beyond the Invisible oh and the fourth oh my god their fourth album with the chick from Olive who did the vocals Gravity of Love that legit is like one of the best that song is so fucking good oh my god if you've never heard Gravity of Love by Enigma go watch the music video right now because it's so
7176852	7184437	I haven't done a stream in a very long time but I know my next stream because I run the audio through different channels so I can do this my next stream is going to be Diablo 4 to Pure Moods 100% we're doing it
7204514	7207257	So, Rob, I was playing Palia last night.
7207397	7207678	Oh, yeah?
7208158	7215045	And I was totally doing it to one of my old playlists, which is nothing but music from Bust a Move, Bust a Move 2.
7215206	7215626	Perfect.
7216086	7217108	Katamari Damacy.
7217128	7219250	I was just going to say, like a DDR soundtrack?
7219450	7219971	Perfect.
7220671	7220852	Perfect.
7220872	7221833	No, it wasn't any DDR.
7221853	7222293	That's fine.
7223434	7228181	It had some diverse system in there, like the diverse versus 8-bit, because I really fucking love Hinotori.
7230184	7234691	But I was doing Polly at a Silent Hill, and that was pretty funny.
7235956	7239299	I remember, do you remember, I wonder what ever happened to this guy.
7239319	7241761	He was a good friend and we just kind of drifted apart.
7241781	7246044	But do you remember the gay guy named Garrett that used to come on the show years ago when we were at Loki's?
7246364	7246684	Remember?
7247905	7250447	I remember when him and I would go on long drives at night.
7250547	7252649	Nothing weird, just, you know, we were bored young.
7253190	7256592	And we would go out to the rural parts of town that were really dark.
7256672	7260996	Like out like the Yolo Causeway rural roads out there.
7261016	7261296	Oh, jeez.
7261656	7290932	and we would drive out there and blast and we would blast the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack like at max volume good times good times you just made me think of Tia Mistress Tia we would go in my Lancer driving through Citrus Heights with White Snakes Here I Go Again playing out of my cheap ass radio yeah
7292470	7293071	Oh, the days.
7293231	7293511	I know.
7293591	7295473	I think she unfriended me on Facebook, which is sad.
7295533	7296273	But, you know, I understand.
7296353	7299156	I haven't talked to her in like 10 years, so I can't be mad about it.
7299176	7302178	But it's, you know, it's one of those like, oh, good memories.
7302278	7306201	You know, people, the little footsteps friends leave in your heart, little things like that.
7306502	7306902	Yeah.
7307042	7307182	Yeah.
7308283	7332903	okay anyway on that note let's get oh wait did we do uk dates did you did you do them yeah i just did okay so i just then we got on the tangent because of screaming in the basement look i had which i had to check with the surroundings of the tangent train apparently it's a flashlight jump scare game because ssj100 matt looked it up for me um but also that just sounds like a metaphor for my life screaming in the basement
7333323	7336585	SSJ100 Matt says, next we will be playing games to Lilith Fair CDs.
7336645	7338567	Y'all know I went to the first Lilith Fair.
7338727	7339467	You know that, right?
7339607	7339948	I went.
7340288	7340828	I am old enough.
7340948	7344891	I went to the very first Lilith Fair in Mountain View, California.
7345852	7347232	Did you go to the Menzies Fair?
7348013	7349154	No, but I did.
7349494	7351015	You know the reference?
7351355	7352016	Yes, I do.
7352156	7354217	That was Hedwig and the Angry Inch, right?
7354237	7354617	Hedwig.
7354737	7355518	Yeah, it was Hedwig.
7355978	7385173	um no it's so who played that Tracy Chapman was the one I remember she was incredible and uh she because she played she played a fucking didgeridoo on stage that's all you need to know uh who else was at that one it was uh Sarah McLachlan of course Paula did Paula Cole play that night no Tori wasn't there on that night um oh my god Suzanne Vega that one Suzanne Vega played there uh and then I think there was one other big headliner I always think of Luca
7386095	7386375	Oh, yeah.
7386735	7389377	Hello, my name is I live on the second floor.
7389497	7391338	Very sad song.
7391398	7392759	I don't think Fiona Apple was at that date.
7392819	7394400	I would have remembered that.
7394480	7395861	It rotated from show to show.
7396521	7401684	So I don't know why I keep thinking Sheryl Crow, but I don't think it was Sheryl Crow.
7401704	7402885	I think she was at one of them.
7403325	7403625	Yeah.
7404085	7409769	I'm looking at the list here of who they had that toured because it wasn't all of these people one night.
7411450	7412770	Oh, I think Jewel was there.
7412910	7413611	I think it was Jewel.
7415199	7415899	Ladyfingers Ladyfingers
7441483	7444845	One of the few songs I will actually get up in karaoke sober.
7445045	7447366	What was the other big song they had that was on MTV all the time?
7448047	7448447	Naked Eye?
7448687	7449507	Yeah.
7449647	7455751	Of course, Daughters of the Chaos is my other favorite by them.
7455811	7461393	I know you're streaming after the show tonight, and I demand 1900s music.
7461894	7461934	1900s?
7462934	7464515	Let me go get out my gramophone.
7464655	7465215	No, 1997 is the 1900s.
7470671	7471932	Oh, I'm thinking 19th century.
7472112	7472773	No, no, 1900.
7473313	7474194	Or like 1900.
7474875	7476917	No, the 1900s, 1997.
7477037	7478759	Alright, that's what the kids call it today.
7479759	7481501	I gotta look for my 90s playlist now.
7481621	7482102	Alright, awesome.
7482542	7486646	Okay, Loki, you've got a very serious story for us to finish this up here.
7486906	7487947	Very, very serious.
7488047	7489468	Absolutely dead serious.
7490349	7493712	GOAT Direct will be taking place this year on April 1st.
7494332	7499597	That, of course, is going to be tied in with more announcements for GOAT Simulator 3.
7500317	7504381	And much like last year when they made announcements about the whole...
7505782	7506182	WackyMiniGames
7532503	7535948	and that's going to take place on Twitch, of course, on Twitch Rivals channel.
7536408	7536628	Nice.
7537089	7537810	I am excited.
7538591	7544879	I can't wait to see what I saw the finish playing through the multiverse of nonsense.
7545560	7548244	I didn't finish that, but I'll have to go back and do that.
7549429	7549769	All right.
7550110	7554052	Well, with this part of the show, we'd like to welcome your comments through our listener roundtable.
7554092	7560016	You can also always leave us messages throughout the week on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

7561838	7566160	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send us emails.
7567361	7570123	But I don't think we had any this week, if I remember right.
7570263	7570423	No.
7570784	7570904	No.
7572245	7572285	No.
7572765	7573485	We also...
7574386	7575407	BlueSky, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7590988	7595931	And this is living that thing we always say at the end of the episode.
7595972	7597513	We're like, tell a friend about the show.
7597573	7598413	Help us spread the word.
7598553	7609300	Orange Rite gets the Gold Star Listener of the Week award for recommending us for the starter pack because we got probably like 20 new followers on Blue Sky from it, which doesn't sound like a lot, but we value every listen.
7610641	7613583	And yeah, put us in a starter pack of podcasts.
7613843	7620628	I just put a post over on our own Blue Sky, which is at OrangeRite.com, the video game podcast pack.
7621248	7622769	So, yeah, thank you for that.
7622989	7624650	And shout out to the Video Game Podcast Pack.
7624710	7626952	By the way, there is also a VOG Network Pack.
7627332	7632235	If you are new to Blue Sky, you can also check out the VOG Network site, which is at vognetwork.com.
7632815	7636037	And it gives you all of our personal accounts on Blue Sky.
7636097	7647184	It gives you the show accounts and also the people that we work with here at the Voice Geeks Network, such as Bobby, Anime Jam Session, and British Invaders.
7647725	7649306	Speaking of Anime Jam Session...
7649966	7652687	I see that we have a call in our Discord green room.
7653087	7654428	Why don't we get to that call?
7654668	7655068	Let's do it.
7655088	7656089	We haven't taken a call in a while.
7656409	7657569	Hello, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.
7657589	7657970	Who's this?
7658950	7661231	Well, hey, it's the one and only Ranma.
7661251	7663532	How is everybody doing tonight?
7663572	7664352	Fantastic.
7664413	7665773	It is great to hear from you, Ranma.
7666213	7667494	Ask me next week.
7669515	7671656	Yeah, ask me after the reveal of the Switch 2.
7677186	7682009	Yeah, Rob, I just want you to know, I really appreciate the last 10 minutes of the show.
7683490	7684690	What, talking about the 1900s?
7685891	7690574	Yes, because I just came back from 90s con about three hours ago.
7690634	7692716	Oh my fucking god, how was 90s con?
7692816	7693436	I want to know.
7694176	7694837	Oh my god.
7694857	7696238	Okay, okay.
7697293	7704235	I got a gift for a co-worker at work, but since you're a big fan of the show as I am, I'm going to show you what I bought him.
7704415	7704915	Please do.
7704935	7706615	Okay, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.
7707195	7707615	Here we go.
7707776	7708616	Nice jammies, by the way.
7709676	7711196	Squad goals, loves.
7711856	7719598	But that's, I mean, Golden Girls is 80s, but I guess... You're right, it ran until 92.
7720078	7720819	It ran until 92.
7721319	7723339	You're going to tell the Golden Gays that?
7723959	7724780	Absolutely not.
7724840	7726180	The Golden Gays can do whatever they want.
7727260	7731886	I just found out they're a drag troupe out of the area and I've got to go to one of their shows.
7732762	7734943	They used to do the drag shows here.
7734983	7744647	It's actually really sad because the big drag queen that was behind the Golden Girls staging efforts in San Francisco, Heclina, she was the drag queen that passed away unexpectedly over in Europe.
7745727	7750689	Justice for Heclina, by the way, because the police are really dragging their feet on doing that investigation.
7751269	7753110	I would encourage more awareness about the topic.
7753150	7759112	If you haven't heard of this, just Google Heclina and what's going on with that.
7759412	7760112	What an inspiration.
7760132	7761273	I'm sorry to be a downer, but
7761553	7764894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7783303	7787545	No, it's only in, I think, Tampa Bay and Hartford, Connecticut.
7787645	7788165	Oh, interesting.
7788245	7788465	Okay.
7789085	7790166	Yeah.
7790306	7795368	I went up there to get, you know, my bestie Mako-chan her belated birthday gift.
7796508	7799249	Autographs by Matthew Lillard and Soleil Moonfry.
7801010	7801190	What?
7801210	7801690	Fuck off.
7801730	7802970	Soleil Moonfry was there?
7803811	7804071	Yes.
7804631	7806072	Oh, my God.
7806252	7807952	I loved her growing up.
7808753	7809173	Fuck.
7809373	7809573	Oh, yeah.
7810532	7812793	You might be a little jealous.
7812913	7814314	It's just laying on me.
7816415	7821998	Okay, so the line from Matthew Little is too long, so I said, screw it, I'll catch him at a Monster Mania for the autograph.
7822198	7830263	So I get on the line, and they tell us that every hour, Soleil has to leave to get something to eat for her blood sugar, which is understandable.
7830723	7836186	Before she left, she handed everybody a cake pop to apologize because she had to go get something to eat.
7836366	7837367	That's cute, yeah.
7838107	7866869	and she gave everybody hugs and I told her that I am here for my bestie for a birthday gift so she autographed the first season of Punky Brewster which I have right here and I'm showing you because she doesn't watch the show so it says on here Punky Power, happy birthday with her real name on it and she's like get your phone ready so she did an impromptu happy birthday video for her
7868680	7870962	I love celebs that are so nice to their fans.
7870982	7875424	Because, you know, last week I was talking about Phyllisa Rose from Super League Camp, who's just like that, like goes the extra mile.
7875984	7876324	Love her.
7876404	7877985	But that's so great to hear about Suleiman Farah.
7878045	7879206	I'll have to see her if she comes to Khan.
7879606	7890232	I will say, look, Rama, as jealous as I am, a couple years ago in Reno, one of those conventions up there, like, I don't know, some comic convention was getting 90 stars.
7890612	7894454	So I did get to meet and get a selfie with Jodie Sweetin from Full House.
7895114	7903521	So I did... I've gotten to meet some of my, you know, 90s princesses throughout my life, so... Oh, you must have missed that post.
7904842	7905203	Oh, what?
7905263	7905943	What happened now?
7907265	7909707	I met Jodie Sweet in a 90s con last year.
7909827	7914711	Got the autograph, the selfie, and we talked... I'm not jealous about that, because I've done that too.
7914991	7915672	Oh, that's great.
7915892	7916272	I love it.
7917053	7917633	Because...
7919018	7926222	The voice of Pikachu in the Japanese version of Pokemon is also the Japanese dub voice of Stephanie Tanner on Full House and Fuller House.
7926802	7927762	Oh, that's wild.
7927822	7928122	Okay.
7929723	7931624	All right, let's get to the topic you wanted to talk about tonight.
7931644	7932945	All right, two things.
7933165	7935566	One, the whole working in the video store thing.
7936606	7939048	At the age of 16, take these tapes.
7939088	7939828	Where am I going?
7940028	7941249	Oh, you're going to put them in the back room.
7941609	7942729	Oh, what's in the back room?
7943130	7943630	You'll see.
7943970	7945731	Walks in the back room, opens the door.
7947971	7951213	Oh, and I hear from the manager, don't stay too long back in there, back there.
7951473	7953015	There's birds and bees in there.
7954856	7961781	And here's something I don't think a lot of people know, but during the 90s of the video stores and so forth,
7963397	7986291	movies came out a year after they hit theaters but if you went to a video store on a regular basis you were able to see those movies six months before anybody else would rental and sell through baby Loki lived that life for so long and when I lived with Loki I got the benefits of that because Loki would be like
7987051	7988271	This movie looks gay.
7988572	7989272	You want to look at it?
7989292	7993373	No, no, he didn't say it that way, but he knew what to look for for me, right?
7993433	7996654	He's like, oh, the Advanced Strangers with Candy DVD?
7997074	7997594	I got you.
7997674	7999775	We're going to watch the movie before it's out on DVD.
7999855	8008318	Like, no, Loki was a champ with that stuff years ago when we lived together in that era.
8008338	8008418	Yeah.
8009861	8013303	Yes, and the whole thing about breaking street date, it is a thing.
8013604	8019347	Because two, three blocks down from the video store I worked at was a rival video store.
8019367	8021149	And I happened to walk in one day.
8021189	8022690	Not the rival video store.
8023670	8030335	And they had a list up on the wall of local video stores that were violating street date for Mortal Kombat 1.
8030375	8032856	And our video store was listed there.
8032896	8033657	And I was like, oh.
8034958	8035158	Oh!
8035398	8035738	You know?
8037019	8037860	That's so funny.
8040177	8042599	Kids today will never know the joys of working in a video store.
8043980	8045361	I mean, not for nothing.
8045381	8047142	That's how I used to get my anime dirt cheap.
8048963	8049403	Perfect.
8050904	8052525	Anything else on your mind to share with us tonight, Ranma?
8052545	8059049	A few weeks ago, you talked about the PlayStation FPGA emulator.
8059069	8060390	I think it's called the Super Station.
8060410	8063732	And I saw it and I actually thought about it.
8064451	8075614	Picking that up and then because there are emulated games that I have never gotten a chance to play because either I couldn't rent it or I couldn't afford it or something like that.
8076195	8086318	And then I started looking at my current game collection and all these remasters coming out and I'm just like, oh, Grandia, let me get that.
8086338	8087138	I didn't get a chance to play that.
8087158	8088398	Let me add that to my collection.
8089019	8091579	Oh, Sukiyota, I only was able to play two hours of that.
8091899	8092540	Let me get that.
8092600	8093360	And I realized...
8094417	8095277	Oh my god, that's so funny.
8123396	8123717	Yes.
8124418	8124759	Yes.
8124899	8132695	So when they did that whole pixel remaster, which I'm going to go into, and I know you're probably mentally laughing about that because you probably called that.
8133444	8136746	Like, when they announced that Pixel Remaster, I remembered that.
8136786	8137307	I'm like, you know what?
8137607	8139088	I gotta get my hands on it.
8139348	8141469	Square Enix, get an available physical copy, $74.99.
8141589	8144952	That's my black ass, Square Enix.
8145312	8145632	No.
8146493	8147333	Holidays come around.
8147793	8149174	Buy two, get one free.
8149234	8152857	Okay, so if I get this game, I get this game, the game comes out to $30.
8153297	8154118	I'll buy it then.
8154418	8154898	Perfect.
8155358	8158300	And I just found out that my sister has a Switch.
8158320	8158861	And I'm like, you know what?
8159801	8162143	Let me just get her a copy of Pixel Remaster.
8162563	8163804	That game's expensive.
8164124	8164584	And you know what?
8164604	8168465	Your sister could save over your save file so it could feel just like old times.
8170166	8172507	We had our own Nintendo.
8173848	8176629	But I'm like, okay, I will get her this game.
8177625	8178265	Game's expensive.
8178705	8181226	I'll just keep an eye out on who has it.
8181786	8188488	I end up importing the game from Canada because it was on sale for $45.99 US.
8188828	8190228	Oh, wow.
8190308	8191709	But shipping, $50 done.
8192229	8195330	The following week, price cut.
8195630	8197910	The Pixel Remastered game for Switch and PS4 is $49.99.
8197970	8198491	I'm just like...
8201051	8204172	And I'm like, Rob Harris, ain't that a bitch?
8204793	8206693	Well, at least you didn't pay.
8206713	8209635	That's one of those FFS moments for a fuck's sake.
8209675	8209895	Yeah.
8211615	8224421	But in a way, I'm not too salty because I picked up mine in a two-for-one special, so when it comes down to it, I pay maybe like $30 to $35 per game, so it's not so bad, so...
8225734	8227835	So let me flip this over to y'all.
8228475	8240200	Are there any games that you recently bought just because either you didn't have the ability to play it previously or you're only able to play it for a few hours for XYZ reasons?
8241491	8245134	Similar to you, but different, the Suikoden 1 and 2 HD remaster.
8245294	8248397	Part of the reason that pushed me to that is that I've actually not really played Suikoden 2.
8249538	8252080	I played the first one, but never really the second one.
8252100	8256263	Of course, I haven't put any time into it, and I need to, but such is life sometimes.
8256323	8257204	But that would be my answer.
8257624	8260407	I haven't bought an actual classic game in a hot minute.
8260867	8263069	I'm not going to these game shops that Loki's going to.
8263789	8268113	Loki, I'm going to throw it over to you next, because you were talking about, did you buy anything at that Fire and Ice shop?
8269011	8270192	No, I did not.
8270232	8272133	Because I know I wouldn't play it.
8274094	8275454	Well, then DarkSakura.
8275915	8276935	I was looking at Zelda, though.
8277155	8279256	I wanted a copy of Zelda.
8279716	8280497	I haven't been there yet.
8282478	8286540	Why would I want to go by, look for games that quite likely I already own?
8287318	8295984	Well, I mean, like, but to Ranma's question, have you bought something recently that you haven't had a chance to, like, that you bought it because you hadn't had a chance to play it yet or whatever?
8296684	8299606	I bought games so I could legally emulate them.
8301768	8306711	So I bought Wonder Project J, and I need to pick up Marvelous.
8307232	8310174	I have not found an affordable Rudra no Hiho yet.
8311335	8314317	But, I mean, yeah.
8314337	8314917	Yeah.
8315782	8319505	Well, in that case, you might want to remind me about that game in about six weeks.
8323107	8323548	Okay.
8324228	8326790	No, I'm going back to Japan for my birthday.
8327971	8331794	Yeah, there's something I'm looking for for Dan over there.
8332815	8337058	And that's that huge-ass, thousand-pound Genesis controller.
8338979	8344143	There is another Super Potato where I will be staying at, so I will be checking there for it.
8345160	8346860	and they have, I will let you know.
8347380	8348221	Take me with you.
8348421	8349841	I'm so happy you get to go back to Japan.
8349881	8350941	I mean, don't get me wrong.
8351021	8353442	I'm hatefully jealous, but I am happy for you.
8353502	8353962	It'll be fun.
8354342	8354802	Wait, wait.
8354942	8355822	Okay, okay, okay.
8355922	8356482	All right, okay.
8356662	8358043	I figured this was going to come up.
8358503	8361003	Here we fucking go.
8361343	8366884	Last weekend, I saw something for you and Alan that I bought that I'm going to put in the box and ship to you.
8366904	8368365	I'm going to show it to you right now.
8368525	8369365	Ship it from Japan.
8369405	8370325	It'll get here faster.
8376179	8376679	I wish.
8377220	8383306	I actually had a friend of mine ship me a couple of Ranma 1.5 magazines because I didn't think I'd get them at Kinokuniya.
8383366	8386610	I actually have a friend now looking for Ranma's outfit.
8386990	8392256	And I'm just like, if you see it, get the largest size you can and hold onto it till you come back.
8392496	8392897	But, um...
8394232	8402136	I know y'all went on the Trek cruise and I'm going through Artist Alley and I saw these amazing fried Trek pins.
8402336	8402697	Yes.
8402937	8403517	Oh my God.
8403717	8403957	Yes.
8404257	8405838	Oh, those are cool too.
8406158	8408340	So there's a guy that like 3D prints them on the cruise.
8408380	8409220	That's a different design.
8409260	8410461	So somebody else is doing that.
8410621	8415944	Cause I love that there's the trans next to the OG, but they don't, they don't have the black and brown, do they?
8416724	8417184	That's a bummer.
8417384	8419186	No, they didn't have that.
8419566	8421647	It's not okay, but I'll take it.
8421988	8422668	It's a nice design.
8424149	8424589	It's a start.
8425050	8426551	Yeah, it's a start.
8426591	8430553	I'm pointing like, oh, it's on my shirt right now and I haven't been on the cruise in a month.
8431314	8437178	He did a rainbow pattern last year and this year he did the progressive flag with the trans and the black brown in it.
8438679	8439940	It's really cool.
8440240	8441581	I love that stuff.
8441761	8443182	I don't just wear them.
8443222	8445063	I have a bag that we put pins on.
8445083	8446144	Alan and I love pins.
8446864	8447605	Oh, I'm so happy.
8447705	8449747	Do you have an Ita bag with all your pins on them?
8450328	8451689	Actually, I think my bag's in this room.
8451749	8452109	Oh, my God.
8452730	8452950	My bag.
8452970	8454532	My poor Ita bag finally died.
8454952	8457014	My bag happens to be in this room.
8457074	8459757	I say it's my bag, but it's actually Alan's bag.
8459857	8460778	Okay, okay.
8460818	8462720	But it's... Oh, shit, I'm knocking things over.
8463160	8466423	That's our little Alola duck trio.
8466483	8467084	Oh, that was...
8467344	8481600	that is precious let's see Stressy, Depressy, Lemon Zesty you know, just a variety of weird shit that I come across so that's where that Star Trek pin's going awesome
8483083	8483323	All right.
8483563	8485505	Well, Ranma, it's a pleasure as always to have you on the show.
8485605	8486245	I appreciate you.
8486926	8487606	Anytime.
8487786	8490368	So are we going to hear 90s Con on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday?
8490888	8494370	You'll hear a little bit of it, and we'll be talking about other things as well.
8494731	8496272	Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention.
8496292	8504277	When I bought this Squad Goals mug, the guy put two pieces of Grandma's candy in there for me.
8506551	8510672	I said, I don't know where they come from but they're absolutely delicious and I love it.
8510732	8512253	No, those strawberry things are bomb.
8512313	8513473	You can find them.
8513693	8516014	Okay, do they have Winco out there?
8517175	8517355	No.
8517535	8524077	Look for a place that sells food by bulk like Winco does because the strawberry shit is in bulk candy sections.
8524557	8525037	You can find them.
8525798	8525938	Yeah.
8527238	8529279	Good luck and or I'm sorry.
8529399	8529899	Take your choice.
8532048	8533349	Ramma, you take care of yourself, my friend.
8534170	8534510	Easy.
8534650	8536271	All of y'all take care of yourselves.
8536631	8542055	As I say on my show, and the late, great Jerry Springer says, take care of yourselves and each other.
8542375	8543416	Rest in peace, Jerry Springer.
8543436	8544177	All right, take care, Ramma.
8545337	8545758	Bye, Ramma.
8546058	8549981	All right, always a pleasure to hear from the one and only Ramma here on the show.
8550841	8558747	For the record, the controller, before I forget, is the XE-1AP, and it weighs like a bag of bricks.
8560056	8564219	Bobby Blackwolf in chat spotted the Duck Dodgers pin on my bag.
8564259	8566901	And yes, that is 100% because of Dragon Con reference.
8567381	8568562	There's this cute little store.
8568602	8571624	So, you know, I host these live horror shows and all this stuff, right?
8572005	8577589	This cute little store that sells all this goth shit opened up right next and she's...
8578229	8578730	She's so smart.
8578790	8584534	She opens up that store on nights that the Love Horror Events is doing a production at the Colonial.
8584835	8589158	And I think she runs an online shop to keep her sales going through the rest of the year.
8589578	8592501	And she has pins, pins, pins.
8592781	8593562	And so I was browsing.
8593602	8595263	It's like that three for $25.
8595303	8598085	And I was browsing the pins one night, and I saw the Duck Dodgers.
8598105	8600067	And I was like, oh, that's Dragon Con.
8600087	8600968	I want a Duck Dodgers pin.
8601428	8604529	So, yeah, what else came from that night?
8604589	8609730	I think the one that says, oh, the Marvin the Martian is from Duck Dodgers.
8610251	8612331	I thought I had an actual Duck Dodgers pin, too.
8612791	8615472	FYI, it's just Marvin Martian.
8618013	8618373	Whatever.
8619213	8621374	I think the Mr. Rogers one came from that, too.
8621434	8622434	Well, actually, Rob.
8623694	8624415	Well, actually.
8624435	8624955	Well, actually.
8625655	8625895	Anyway.
8627478	8628779	A Sailor Venus pin.
8628839	8629359	Yes, you did.
8629439	8631701	You did spot a Sailor Venus pin in the corner.
8631821	8632301	You sure did.
8633142	8633882	So, all right.
8634543	8638465	I have to tell you about the pins I just picked up, by the way, because you'll enjoy this.
8639946	8641767	I now have a Dracula and an Alucard.
8642888	8643428	Oh, I love it.
8644189	8644989	And they're big.
8645750	8648031	There's a Sailor Venus pin on there because it's Alan's bag.
8648131	8650253	I just stole it because that's what happens when you're married.
8650293	8651453	You steal each other's things.
8652874	8653134	True. 100%.
8655037	8659099	Okay, on that note, Loki, any last-minute stories before we wrap it up tonight?
8659599	8660440	There is nothing.
8660740	8661100	All right.
8661260	8664762	Everybody's waiting until, you know, Switch 2 announcements.
8665626	8666826	Clenched with Baited Breath.
8666906	8667146	All right.
8667186	8671247	Well, then I will say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting our show.
8671287	8674428	If you enjoyed what you heard here, help us spread the word and leave a review.
8674488	8680369	A nice five-star review on a space like Apple Podcasting, Spotify, or YouTube goes an awful long way.
8680709	8681449	We appreciate all that.
8681509	8682149	Tell a friend.
8682790	8683410	Help us spread the word.
8683430	8685170	Thank you so much for joining us tonight.
8685790	8686330	Final thoughts.
8686350	8689111	We're going to start with DarkSakura because I believe you are streaming tonight.
8690436	8690836	I am.
8690936	8699880	So basically, I thought that my schedule was going to an hour earlier, which would have deeply infringed upon any time so that I could have, you know, after stream time.
8700700	8704002	My schedule stayed the same, and I'm still working from home on Monday, so hell yeah.
8705882	8709444	Alright, well we will see you in the Debbies, and I will have a Shay with me.
8710000	8710521	Sounds great.
8710841	8711401	Have a good time.
8711742	8713563	We'll see you in a little bit.
8736764	8741646	How the fuck did Rob plant 28,000 flowers in the Pikmin Challenge this week?
8742247	8747889	Because this friend and I are encouraging each other to walk five miles every time we do it.
8748190	8755993	And we have this giant loop that we go drive and walk a big five miles now that it's late enough at night that we've been doing.
8756073	8757354	So we do that at least twice.
8757374	8759555	I try to get in a third one.
8760115	8761936	Bobby says, I felt bad that I had Big Fat Zero.
8761976	8762537	Don't feel bad.
8762577	8765278	I know there's other parts of the country have inclement weather.
8765678	8767639	I had COVID a few weeks ago and didn't walk at all.
8768019	8774923	No, I'm happy to carry the group because it actually gives me more motivation to walk the 10,000 steps and five miles.
8775363	8776804	So it works for me.
8777124	8778185	I don't care.
8778605	8784188	But yeah, Wednesday night, nerding out over the Switch 2 announcements, probably going to happen.
8784228	8785288	Maybe Loki will be here too.
8785348	8785668	Who knows?
8786249	8787509	You and Jamie have an invited horse.
8787990	8790371	All right, Loki, your final thoughts for tonight.
8791597	8796243	My final thought is just I should be doing some streaming later this month.
8796604	8796924	I don't know.
8797465	8800329	Oh, and then on the flip side, I get Jury Duty at the end of the month.
8800349	8801130	Jury Duty?
8802191	8803253	Who did you piss off?
8805282	8805722	It's been a while.
8805842	8806383	That's no fun.
8806543	8806803	All right.
8806843	8807724	Well, good luck with all that.
8808364	8808664	All right.
8808744	8814167	Well, with that, we are going to wrap it up here at the Voice Geeks Network for the day and for our show.
8814228	8815969	Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8816389	8817690	We will see you in seven days.
8817790	8821932	And finally, finally, no more switch to rumors for now.
8822653	8824094	Switch to facts.
8824454	8826175	We get to decompress them all next week.
8826315	8827536	I hope you will be here with us.
8827936	8829017	It's going to be an exciting week.
8829057	8829657	Until next time.
8829757	8829997	Bye.
8832059	8834360	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8836782	8837283	See you next week.
