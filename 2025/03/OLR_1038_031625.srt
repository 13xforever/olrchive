1
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: and Gadget reported on Microsoft's Copilot for Gaming preview referring to its ability to help folks download and launch games as Copilot solves the eternal problem of pressing a button.

2
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Not everything is distributed through a launcher.

3
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Notably, downloading content via HIO requires one to be reasonably adept with using a computer.

4
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:31,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, we've been doing this since the 90s, but there's a reason why technology and gaming continues to proliferate the way it does these days.

5
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Because someone made it easier.

6
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:34,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone is a beginner once.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's time for your hosts, Straw Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about Copilot for Gaming and the rest of the week's gaming news.

8
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:42,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

9
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:47,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,559
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We're live with you once again tonight, March the 16th of 2025.

13
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy pre-St.

14
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick's Day, as the case may be.

15
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:04,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It is episode number 1038 of our show.

16
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:16,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here every week at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Sunday nights, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except not tonight.

17
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf is out watching sports ball that he has season tickets for, so he is out watching the sports ball.

18
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, and gaming bullshit a lot with me, Rob Roberts, and the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:35,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

20
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you, Jamie Summers?

21
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:45,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting over a cold and I have been completely obsessed with watching Chinese period dramas.

22
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:47,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fun.

23
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: About harem life.

24
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:49,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

25
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:53,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they current or are they like made in the 80s or things like that?

26
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:57,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you mean, made in the 80s?

27
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is a fairly recent one.

28
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:00,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's what I mean.

29
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:01,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Ancient story.

30
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:05,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, like, you know, you could get into something like, oh, God, what's that show?

31
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:06,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Downton Abbey.

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,050
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's like a 20-year-old show at this point.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,172
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like that, you know, I'm just kind of, like, if it's a modern show or if it's a classic show.

34
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to see when it came out.

35
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:19,536
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, it had really high production value and looks really nice.

36
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:19,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

37
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:20,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

38
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Empresses in the Palace.

39
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:23,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

40
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:27,316
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's in HD, you know it's like at least 2010.

41
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:29,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The melodrama is real.

42
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:31,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a drama, it's a melodrama.

43
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one's more dramatic?

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,982
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're watching or a telenovela?

46
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I love me a telenovela.

47
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I don't understand.

48
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to watch the subtitles, but they're so good.

49
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a different kind of drama.

50
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:46,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

51
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:48,290
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

52
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:38,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I am at the revenge part 76 episodes and I'm on 56 since this is a video gaming podcast I'm trying to think is there a game that has that high level of drama and I'm like I don't know why but the first game that came to mind was Metal Gear with that type of it's not dramatic enough they do reference the time of the three kingdoms okay

53
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:43,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Like those, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and all those games?

54
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:43,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

55
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which was a real, you know, period of history.

56
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:54,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So they talk about some of the, like, different texts that have influenced some games and stuff.

57
00:03:54,165 --> 00:04:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it kinda goes, but it's a... I'm stupidly into it, and I just looked at it because I was mildly curious, and I can't stop.

58
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:11,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to see where this train wreck goes I don't know

59
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

60
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:30,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We have learned nothing.

61
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say I've learned prime numbers thanks to number munchers.

62
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,137
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I learned from video games.

63
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:35,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, this show came out in 2011.

64
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:37,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

65
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:38,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

66
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:40,483
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

67
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Before times.

68
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Before times.

69
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:42,865
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Loki?

70
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:43,685
[SPEAKER_04]: How's your week been?

71
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good up until today.

72
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:48,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

73
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everything's going okay.

74
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:50,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

75
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just disappointing.

76
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's the Stray Cat drama stuff.

77
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:03,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stray Cat is... I haven't heard the latest on this in a while.

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, no.

79
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we've been acclimating the cat more and more to the house.

80
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:14,290
[SPEAKER_07]: She just comes in like a few times a day usually and eats and stuff.

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,576
[SPEAKER_07]: She has a bed and doesn't really use it because, you know, cats never use the things that you purchase for them.

82
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they don't.

83
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:21,938
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just installed a...

84
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:28,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a cat door for the inside-outside, and she's been going into the garage.

85
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I started letting her go into the garage.

86
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:36,299
[SPEAKER_07]: And she takes naps in, like, a dirty... My old office chair that's, like, super dusty out there.

87
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's because it's quiet.

89
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And she'll come in for pets and stuff like that.

90
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyways, so I got knocked on the door today.

91
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:45,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

92
00:05:47,208 --> 00:06:10,125
[SPEAKER_07]: there's like a woman standing outside she's like you know about this cat i'm like yeah it's a stray cat that i've been taking care of you know she's like oh she's like i've been taking care of that cat for seven and a half years um and she lives across the street i guess but apparently she got another cat or something like that or there was another cat that she's taking care of that's scaring the other cat away and so she's been missing for a while um

93
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:35,135
[SPEAKER_07]: and so she's been coming over here to stay but apparently she goes over there and also like sleeps in their bed and stuff and all that stuff so it's just this point because like I don't like I was trying to work towards adopting the cat and now I can't do that so it's like it's just I don't know it's annoying all right is the neighbor at least still let the cat wander into your dirty office chair

94
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

95
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,515
[SPEAKER_07]: She's relieved that the cat's not, like, living on the street.

96
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:50,645
[SPEAKER_07]: That she's, you know, and I think she's living somewhere else, too, because she always goes, like, the neighbor is in one direction, but the cat always goes in the opposite direction.

97
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, she's, like, sleeping over somewhere over there.

98
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:55,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know.

99
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with FifthDream in chat.

100
00:06:58,653 --> 00:06:59,654
[SPEAKER_04]: A little two-timing kitty.

101
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:01,732
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

102
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:44,542
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah and left back into the park and she wandered over here and then the woman took care of her for a while um I don't know like whatever it's just it's annoying because like we've been investing all this time and stuff we're like oh yeah we need to get the pet doors so when we go on vacation in a few months you know that she can get out on her own and like

103
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:56,012
[SPEAKER_07]: um and it's like oh yeah hey cool well I'm just gonna be like you know owning the cat now and she'll come over here occasionally you know here here's some of her food and her toy it's like but I'm

104
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I taking care of this cat now?

105
00:07:57,862 --> 00:07:59,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are you taking care of this cat?

106
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Whose fucking cat is this?

107
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

108
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

109
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,884
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I'm like, is this... Are you saying I can take this cat?

110
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:11,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you saying that, like, you're keeping the cat, but it sounds like you're keeping the cat still, but I'm taking care of the cat.

111
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:12,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't understand what's going on.

112
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my cat, but you're going to take care of it and pay.

113
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:16,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not whose cat it is.

114
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's who belongs to the cat.

115
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:19,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

116
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:20,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, too.

117
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's confusing.

118
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's very confusing.

119
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:23,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

120
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:25,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

121
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,324
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, that was fun.

122
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally get your frustrations, Loki.

123
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:33,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was always the worst fear in the back of my mind when Mr. Smush was around.

124
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:34,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, he's no longer with us.

125
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:43,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But when he was around, like I was always like, oh, the owners are going to answer the phone someday or the, you know, suddenly show up, you know, out of nowhere and be like, oh, we've been missing our cat for six years.

126
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was like always my worst fear.

127
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:46,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get it.

128
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you invest all that time and energy into a cat.

129
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:49,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

130
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she's still hanging.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she's in the garage right now.

132
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so she still hangs out over here.

133
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like a lot more than the other house.

134
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,506
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's because she's been gone for a while.

135
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:02,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she hasn't been over there very often.

136
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:07,694
[SPEAKER_07]: And when she is going over there, she's not as like super hungry as she normally is because she's eating here.

137
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:10,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So the woman is confused as to what's going on.

138
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,478
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think she's relieved in that sense.

139
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:13,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, I don't know.

140
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to look her dead in the eye and be like, ma'am, your cat is a whore.

141
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:29,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not bad, it's like, it's like, because, like, I feel bad, like, if I, okay, so say this is the other woman's cat, like, and now I decide, okay, I want to get a permanent cat for the house.

142
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:37,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I would feel bad if this cat, like, all of a sudden is like, oh, I'm scared to go into this house now, and I'm going to go hide.

143
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:42,917
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I don't know, it feels, like, bad to do that to, like, an animal or something, but, you know.

144
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,542
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also sounds like the cat's kind of established itself in your garage, which I'm not sure a lot of cats would otherwise go into.

145
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:56,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess I don't know the traffic of your house, but maybe... Like, I would think if that situation were to happen, the cats would probably have their different areas.

146
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, your new cat just wouldn't go to the garage.

147
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:03,507
[SPEAKER_07]: She's very skittish in the sense that, like, she doesn't like when people are... Well, like, she's fine with...

148
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and my wife hanging out and stuff.

149
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:11,851
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the kids running around or shouting or doing whatever they're doing.

150
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,491
[SPEAKER_07]: She's uncomfortable.

151
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The sound of the heater coming on and stuff like that.

152
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,934
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't understand what the house sounds are.

153
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:23,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the garage is just quiet and she's used to sleeping outside.

154
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

155
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:28,819
[SPEAKER_07]: She's usually around a lot more once it's raining out.

156
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,560
[SPEAKER_07]: But now she has a way in and out.

157
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,242
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just weird because I thought we were working towards a point and it's like

158
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's not going to happen, so whatever.

159
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:39,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

160
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a complicated sort of situation.

161
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep us updated on who the cat chooses, because it sounds like the cat might be choosing you most of the time.

162
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:54,354
[SPEAKER_04]: But that cat is a little two-timer, so look out for empty promises and so forth in that cat.

163
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:59,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well anyway, we do talk about video games once in a while here on this show.

164
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:01,157
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a little bit going on this week, actually.

165
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:03,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we've had some somewhat slower news weeks.

166
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like this week's really been picking up.

167
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a pretty damn big headline to start us off, especially in the world of mobile games.

168
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:15,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, I'm going to turn it over to you, but when y'all hear what this is about, you know I'm going to have opinions.

169
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:17,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a lot of opinions on this, but I'm going to let Loki start off.

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so apparently there was rumors that Niantic was going to be sold to a Saudi Arabia-backed company called Scopely Inc.

171
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:28,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently it is true.

172
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:37,407
[SPEAKER_07]: They were sold to Scopely, which is owned by Savvy Games Group, which is a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.

173
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:42,489
[SPEAKER_07]: They also hold 6.3% stake in Nintendo.

174
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Niantic has reached an agreement to...

175
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:57,181
[SPEAKER_07]: for Scopely to acquire them for $3.5 billion with an additional $350 million in cash from Niantic being distributed as part of a deal.

176
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:03,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Toll value of $3.85 billion for Niantic equity holders.

177
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so interesting that they're owned by the Saudis now.

178
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:18,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and the makers of what, Monopoly Go, I think they bought Marvel Strike Force some time ago.

179
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:25,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, a lot of folks in the player base of Pokemon Go have a lot of fear around this company taking over.

180
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:29,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say Pokemon Go, Pikmin, Monster Hunter, that's all in it too.

181
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know Pokemon Go is the big one in the room, right?

182
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:48,625
[SPEAKER_04]: and so a lot of people have a lot of fear about the amount of microtransactions that could be coming to the game because Scopely is kind of known for I wouldn't even say nickel and diming their users they're known for $99-ing their users that's the type of stuff we're talking about I okay

183
00:12:50,655 --> 00:13:18,430
[SPEAKER_04]: so I trash it I have a lot of thoughts when it comes to uh this because obviously I've been playing Niantic games a very long time and it started with a game called Ingress that I don't think a lot of people really talk about anymore but Ingress was the first Niantic game that you know the actual game that came out Niantic the first app I think that came out of Niantic was called Field Trip and it wasn't a game it was meant to find locations near you and then um uh

184
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,771
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

185
00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:35,509
[SPEAKER_04]: to incentivize more people to submit things like Field Trip to really build up the database of local points of interest and interesting things that kind of gamified that whole thing.

186
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and I'm really cutting corners in this abridged little story about Niantic.

187
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:48,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And then essentially some folks in Japan played Ingress that had connections to Pokemon.

188
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:54,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time Niantic was a Google subsidiary and that whole Google Maps Pokemon April Fool's joke happened.

189
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:56,014
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

190
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,874
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:14:40,489 --> 00:14:41,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

192
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:03,938
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

193
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Monster Hunter.

194
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still played Pikmin.

195
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:35,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think Pikmin is actually one of the best Niantic games because of how passive it is and how much it incentivizes walking and all that stuff.

196
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:51,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played all those games over the years and here's my take on this whole thing is that the more I think about it, the less it actually surprises me because I don't think Niantic ever wanted to be in the video game business.

197
00:15:53,206 --> 00:16:01,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that might sound very shocking for a company that made like one of the biggest games in... No, no, the biggest game in mobile game history.

198
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:02,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not mince words.

199
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest game in mobile game history.

200
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:08,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Niantic became accidental billionaires with that game.

201
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think they ever really wanted to be a gaming company.

202
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the first sign...

203
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:18,383
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

204
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, isn't this interesting?

205
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:52,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Niantic is now doubling down and basically saying, you know what?

206
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:57,838
[SPEAKER_04]: All this gamification and all these games and things like that, it's in a place where it's kind of its own thing now.

207
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get back to exploring the world.

208
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: So they sold everything that's the games part over to Scopely.

209
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interesting thing in all of this, they kept Ingress.

210
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,842
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

211
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:29,840
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

212
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:48,512
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

213
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:32,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a moral quandary with this I'm interested to see what they do because for the most part these sorts of things that Niantic does I find the most interesting I doubt any of you have ever checked out Scannaverse and I don't blame you it's not really a game but I think it's fucking fascinating some of the stuff they're doing with it

214
00:18:33,423 --> 00:18:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let me put it like, this is what you can do.

215
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:39,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You can scan something in 3D on your mobile phone.

216
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So like one thing I did when I was in Nashville, there was a giant mural of Dolly Parton reading a book to a child.

217
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a portal in the game called Dolly Reads.

218
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is really cool.

219
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a little 3D scan of this.

220
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,790
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did.

221
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:52,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And

222
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,551
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

223
00:19:19,864 --> 00:19:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could scan, which kind of leads to weird copyright issues, but it's still an area we're exploring.

224
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:30,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's for personal use, it's one thing.

225
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: People scanning statues, and then now you can take that same data and 3D print statues.

226
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

227
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:03,163
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

228
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:24,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I shouldn't say that because we know Niantic has had their ups and downs, right?

229
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,582
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had some pretty catastrophic botched launches, i.e.

230
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Catan didn't happen, i.e.

231
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,405
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA All World, Poopy, i.e.

232
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:33,845
[SPEAKER_04]: what else?

233
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did they?

234
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:38,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever Marvel fucking thing they were going to do, like never even fucking happened.

235
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:47,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, they have had some very botched things along the way because I just don't think these guys knew how or wanted to run a gaming company.

236
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

237
00:21:08,065 --> 00:21:35,621
[SPEAKER_04]: we're fucked that's what that all goes to if you're a fan of Pikmin or Pokemon or Monster Hunter sorry kids we're fucked because now it's gonna be how do we make money off of this but there is I've seen all of the like danger scenarios of they're gonna charge you to even throw a Pokeball and have energy or even do gyms or they're gonna charge you for boosted shinies here's your one

238
00:21:36,121 --> 00:22:02,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Saving Grace in all three of those games is you have monetization and I'm sorry you do have monetization but you also have partnerships in especially in Pokemon Go and Pikmin and a notoriously difficult to work with organization in things like this and I'm talking about both the Pokemon company Pokemon Go and I'm talking about Nintendo Pikmin Bloom I'm talking about them both

239
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:07,095
[SPEAKER_04]: for being notoriously difficult with these types of partnerships.

240
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of your disaster scenarios, I don't think a Pokemon company is going to let fly.

241
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's as simple as that.

242
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:24,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as all of these, remember when everybody was bitching and moaning and niantic about all of these changes and how things went bad and all that stuff?

243
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:29,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I assure you, Scopely will not give a fuck

244
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:33,025
[SPEAKER_04]: about those types of complaints.

245
00:22:33,745 --> 00:22:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: And those sorts of things will be changed for the worse to benefit the dollar no matter what you have to say about it.

246
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:46,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's my take on that.

247
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:56,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm willing to keep entertaining those games and playing those games until that day comes, but the minute the day comes where the monetization gets out of hand, bitch, I'm out.

248
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:57,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out.

249
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see.

250
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:00,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Deft in chat says,

251
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:19,364
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

252
00:23:37,308 --> 00:23:43,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I will agree with you that just because they're the Pokemon company doesn't mean they're not going to monetize completely.

253
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:48,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's more of these quality of life changes that y'all bargained for with Niantic.

254
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:51,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a brick wall with Scopely.

255
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect those changes to be reversed.

256
00:23:55,496 --> 00:23:57,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Expect the PokeStops to go back to 40 meters.

257
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Expect all those things about accessibility and all that.

258
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Scopely will not give a fuck.

259
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:04,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee it.

260
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Guarantee it.

261
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:11,759
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where I kind of see the changes happening there.

262
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,740
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some other comments because y'all have some good stuff here in our chat.

263
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, we tape live on Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

264
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:22,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Sjohn Hunter Matt says, I don't know what Pogo is going to look like three years from now.

265
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: The only positives are they acquired the team and didn't lay anyone off.

266
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

267
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,785
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a huge positive.

268
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a great thing to come out of this news.

269
00:24:30,806 --> 00:24:31,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope...

270
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:33,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I need one of those things.

271
00:24:51,943 --> 00:24:58,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people that work in Niantic, and for their sake, they are very talented, very good people, and I really hope not.

272
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:03,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, I feel like I've seen this song and dance before, Activision Blizzard Niantic.

273
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,835
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with my brain today?

274
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:06,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm mixing all these things up.

275
00:25:07,036 --> 00:25:09,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is my case in point.

276
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

277
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,571
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says, Rob's burying the lead that he semi-predicted this a year or two ago.

278
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:19,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob Stradamus.

279
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,094
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

280
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a New Year's prediction a couple years ago.

281
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:24,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm almost positive.

282
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:27,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it happens.

283
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:28,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Me predicting?

284
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:29,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?

285
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:31,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, Humble, of course, always.

286
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:34,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Where were we?

287
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:38,773
[SPEAKER_04]: On Matt's comment further, also, whatever ridiculous monetizations won't happen overnight.

288
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:41,155
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest, we'll see what they do with the monetization.

289
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:46,240
[SPEAKER_04]: If they monetize the catch rate or shiny rates of Pogo, then the fans will quit the app.

290
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,285
[SPEAKER_04]: The Who, Saudi PIF that acquired them, can't be ignored here as well.

291
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:51,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

292
00:25:53,208 --> 00:26:04,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, since I'm riding a high on the prediction train, here is my prediction for how Scopely will monetize Pokemon Go that will not be popular with the fanbase.

293
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:13,182
[SPEAKER_04]: The sale of this game is coming at a very interesting time because they're running out of Pokemon to add into the game.

294
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:24,124
[SPEAKER_04]: They're running out of Pokemon that exist in, you know, I think there are still some Alola Pokemon and some Galar Pokemon still left to be added.

295
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:27,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's about all we're missing at this point, okay?

296
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:32,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know there is likely a new Pokemon game in the horizon.

297
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:34,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we don't have all the Paldea Pokemon either.

298
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:35,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

299
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:37,444
[SPEAKER_04]: They're drip feeding some of those.

300
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:48,886
[SPEAKER_04]: My prediction is that instead of these Pokemon coming out for free with all of these events that are happening, there's going to be Pokemon expansion packs.

301
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:58,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can bet your ass Generation 10 will be an expansion pack that you're going to have to pay money to get those Pokemon to show up in the world.

302
00:26:59,248 --> 00:27:01,368
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my little prediction.

303
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:03,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Write it on a card that's going to piss people off.

304
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon expansion packs.

305
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:13,314
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already dabbling in that when it comes to boosted shinies, but they've never been really willing to cross that line.

306
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:16,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Niantic was willing to cross that line with the player base.

307
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Scopely will cross that line.

308
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,781
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to say there's already 600 Pokemon in this game for free.

309
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,142
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the next 50?

310
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:23,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay up.

311
00:27:24,764 --> 00:27:25,545
[SPEAKER_04]: $29.99 expansion pack.

312
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:28,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Astral Projection.

313
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know whatever they call it.

314
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,502
[SPEAKER_04]: as you and her Matt also points out the battle season pass and that whole thing.

315
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:39,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can bet your ass that's continuing.

316
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:44,508
[SPEAKER_04]: That was going to happen even if it stayed with Niantic because every game is turning up with a battle pass at some point.

317
00:27:44,828 --> 00:27:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my prediction for Pikmin is they're going to figure out how to do the battle pass of Pikmin because that's the one thing it's kind of missing.

318
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:52,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

319
00:27:54,344 --> 00:28:01,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, and Mike Def says, if, like you said, the Pokemon Company International won't let that happen.

320
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:08,030
[SPEAKER_04]: They allowed a monetization of extra Pokemon and Pokemon Unite and those things.

321
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

322
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:11,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

323
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:12,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a prediction.

324
00:28:12,951 --> 00:28:14,412
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean I won't be wrong.

325
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to be wrong.

326
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love for nothing to change.

327
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:19,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love for the monetization to just stay the way it is.

328
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:21,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That game makes enough fucking money.

329
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:24,482
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

330
00:28:46,560 --> 00:29:07,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dropped all the Niantic games so not really that's fair and I think I'm not playing it I figured that it's just any of these companies are eventually these games are going to be unless it's an indie studio that's operating with very low profits if it's a larger company these games are just going to turn to shit eventually it's just a matter of time yeah

331
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:21,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and as here's the interesting thing in all this, as far as the Ingress fans go, and there are thousands, no, there are a hundred, there are dozens of us that are hardcore Ingress fans out there.

332
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:25,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you, this news is best case scenario for us.

333
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:27,192
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

334
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:50,688
[SPEAKER_04]: This was the best part because it's very hard to monetize Ingress.

335
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But this way, they're going to find the monetization in data.

336
00:29:54,029 --> 00:30:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to find monetization in other ways that they can sell, which they're already doing with what they're getting out of Scannaverse and other projects.

337
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:06,553
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as Ingress goes, we're feeling fine on all this for now.

338
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:10,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess we shouldn't get too cocky, but I feel like the Ingress player base is like, okay.

339
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:12,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, though, this is the weird part.

340
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I thought of something else.

341
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,642
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the very weird part.

342
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:27,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Amongst the Pokemon Go and the Monster Hunter and all this stuff, Wayfarer being a part of the sale does not make sense to me.

343
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:31,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not understand why Niantic Wayfarer was part of the sale.

344
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

345
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:35,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Campfire I get.

346
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And Campfire actually could be more interesting with the other Scopely games being worked into it.

347
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, good luck to them, I guess.

348
00:30:43,354 --> 00:30:44,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see where that ends up.

349
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as Wayfarer goes, my thought was Pokemon Go and those other games would have ended up the same way as Harry Potter Wizards Unite.

350
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Problematic author aside, from the game perspective, that game was not a Niantic game.

351
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a Portkey Games game, which was a subsidiary of WB, which made all the Harry Potter games.

352
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,566
[SPEAKER_04]: They only relied on Niantic for their...

353
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Wayfarer Network.

354
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:28,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And my full expectation was that Pokemon Go, Pikmin, would use that same partnership and then rely on the Wayfarer Network, which should, you would think, still be maintained by Niantic Spatial.

355
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not part of what's happening here.

356
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:35,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Wayfarer is also going to Scopely, which to me is strange.

357
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:40,023
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that working with Ingress then?

358
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the same data.

359
00:31:42,143 --> 00:31:43,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not know.

360
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:48,264
[SPEAKER_04]: The assumption among the fanbase is that the data will be forked.

361
00:31:50,004 --> 00:31:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a pun.

362
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:52,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually mean forked.

363
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:56,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning that at some point, whether that's January 1st, 26th, or whenever this deal closes.

364
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:57,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, this isn't a closed deal yet.

365
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:04,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever this deal closes, then Scopely will have their database and Ingress will have their database.

366
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:08,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, honestly, yay.

367
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:15,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I tell you the worst thing that happened to the Ingress Portal Network was allowing Pokemon Go players to submit Pokestops?

368
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:16,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not a read.

369
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Pokemon Go.

370
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:18,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the players.

371
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:27,860
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is a PvP game and a PvE game have very different expectations for where there should be points of interest.

372
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:56,543
[SPEAKER_04]: that was always a problem in Ingress let me tell you how many of us dozens of Ingress fans can't wait to start removing bullshit so I don't know I feel like the data is going to get forked and I mean actual fork not a pun but we do not know at this point what's going to happen for all we know Niantic starts getting their shit from Scopely

373
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope not, I really hope not

374
00:33:02,076 --> 00:33:29,061
[SPEAKER_04]: but Niantic also has Scanaverse and that's a big thing Scanaverse is different from Wayfarer and there's the whole light ship which I think is now called Niantic Spatial and there's a whole other many of you don't ever see this but there's a whole other lightship.dev which I think is now Niantic Spatial there is a whole other copy of what you see on Wayfarer but with all the scanning data is there

375
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:32,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So technically that data is already forked.

376
00:33:32,682 --> 00:33:38,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Niantic has a whole other system you just don't often see in that system that merges in with Wayfarer.

377
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:40,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking that's just going to get split.

378
00:33:41,783 --> 00:33:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

379
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:42,663
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

380
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: SGO100Matt says, Rob hates Little Free Library Pokestops confirmed.

381
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, for the most part, I do hate Little Free Library Pokestops.

382
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:53,305
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Little Free Library is at a park, a public park, I'm fine with it.

383
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:56,506
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Little Free Library is in front of somebody's house, I don't care for it.

384
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:01,969
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Pokemon, I'm all for it.

385
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have more Pokestops, not less.

386
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Ingress, they're fucking annoying.

387
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's see.

388
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:16,052
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100Matt says, I saw a Little Free Blockbuster library someone made where someone put a bunch of DVDs in there.

389
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really funny.

390
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:17,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

391
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends actually has a Little Free library that's art-based.

392
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:28,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in there, it's little tiny art things that you can give and take.

393
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:29,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cute.

394
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:31,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a really clever idea.

395
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,642
[SPEAKER_04]: PogCulture says, what if the park is in front of someone's house?

396
00:34:35,802 --> 00:34:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm fine with it.

397
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:38,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Then good for you, you live in front of a park.

398
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:44,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, if the Little Free Library is in the park boundary, I'm fine with it.

399
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:47,592
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's in your house boundary across the street from the park, I'm not okay with it.

400
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:48,412
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference.

401
00:34:50,073 --> 00:34:50,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

402
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:53,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, but anything in a park is fair game.

403
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything in the park should be lit up.

404
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always felt that way.

405
00:34:58,035 --> 00:35:09,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, enough of me monologuing on Niantic, but when I tell you I have spent the last 10 years of my life playing Ingress, this kind of news is, you know, it's a big deal.

406
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:11,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens in the next year.

407
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:14,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

408
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:17,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

409
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:18,886
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

410
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:19,547
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

411
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:25,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I played, well actually I don't think I played any Dead by Daylight this week.

412
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,343
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I played some on Sunday, of course, after the show last week.

413
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, okay.

414
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But I took the time off because Smokey, who is a big jerk, gave me 5,000 bits to buy Monster Hunter Wilds.

415
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:48,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, I'm so I haven't been able to catch these streams.

416
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so curious.

417
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:50,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So curious.

418
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:51,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complicated.

419
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:55,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a lot to get used to and I don't like that.

420
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:04,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess since it's just like an always online live experience that you can't actually pause the game.

421
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:34,306
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got like your menus that pop up over like all the other things that you do but I'm having fun so far and I'm enjoying it you know once I'm getting used to it I wish I had a lot more free exploration I could do instead of follow these people I mean it's it's getting there it's growing on me so I'll be playing it on Friday nights I think because I'm on my third playthrough of Dragon Age the Veil Guard

422
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm still super enjoying Dragon Age as well.

423
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that.

424
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I tried to start... I was bringing back Retro Knight, and I started to play the Nintendo 64 Dobutsu no Mori as an Animal Forest or Animal Crossing.

425
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game locked on me.

426
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hadn't saved yet.

427
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make it very far.

428
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:00,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I had just met all my neighbors.

429
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had some of the best neighbors.

430
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Daisy.

431
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: and I had Eloise and I told everybody about Dina who I wish would, you know, come back.

432
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:16,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Dina was our town lesbian.

433
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you muted?

434
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:21,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I?

435
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:21,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I am.

436
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I hit my button on accident.

437
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:25,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Dina was the lesbian anteater, right?

438
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least canonically in your town.

439
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:29,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, she was a duck?

440
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:30,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought she was an anteater.

441
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:32,916
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a green duck who had the gym equipment.

442
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:33,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

443
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,442
[SPEAKER_03]: and then she left my village for yours.

444
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:39,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

445
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sorry.

446
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:48,551
[SPEAKER_03]: We even put pride flags and everything outside of her house to show her how much we supported her.

447
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that happened.

448
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:53,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I tell a story?

449
00:37:55,336 --> 00:38:04,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember when we got a villager to say a very nasty word beginning with C and we got it to move to somebody's village that really did not like that word?

450
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,044
[SPEAKER_04]: That person had to work forever to erase that word.

451
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:13,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone said it.

452
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:14,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It spread.

453
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,852
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's so funny because now it's in Eurovision.

454
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:30,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's literally that song going, I'm serving Kant, except it's the Maltesian word for singing and not, you know, anything else.

455
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:31,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

456
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:32,144
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

457
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:32,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuntology 101?

458
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

459
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a real song and I super love it.

460
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:40,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the... That's a different song.

461
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:42,867
[SPEAKER_03]: C-U-N-T I want to do what's best for me.

462
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:43,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm cunty.

463
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:47,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to hear that song called I'm Serving Cunt.

464
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Do-do-do-do-do.

465
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Do-do-do-do-do.

466
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:51,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Do-re-mi-fa-so-so Serving Cunt.

467
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

468
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

469
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:57,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking... It's going to go in my play... You realize it's going to go in my playlist, right?

470
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,010
[SPEAKER_03]: As it should.

471
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,351
[SPEAKER_03]: My streaming playlist.

472
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:00,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to type how to...

473
00:39:01,895 --> 00:39:09,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the name of the artist, but it's Malta's entry into Eurovision.

474
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:12,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

475
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:13,611
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

476
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:14,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

477
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's called Kant.

478
00:39:16,874 --> 00:39:17,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

479
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say it like that.

480
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:19,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

481
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:19,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

482
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:22,459
[SPEAKER_04]: But when she sings it, it don't sound like that.

483
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:33,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But make sure you get the actual version called Kant and not because they did a Eurovision safe edit called Serving because Eurovision wouldn't let them do it with the full word.

484
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:34,429
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, it doesn't matter.

485
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:37,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Mariana Conte.

486
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:38,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

487
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

488
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:42,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you the video after the show.

489
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just text it to you.

490
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Small Shay in chat says, what did I just hear Rob say?

491
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:47,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm barely awake.

492
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

493
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:49,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all a dream, Shay.

494
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to bed.

495
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:51,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Have some more coffee, Shay.

496
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Have some more coffee, Shay.

497
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:54,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

498
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:58,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, this all started with Animal Crossing and your villagers serving.

499
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they were totally serving it.

500
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:01,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

501
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so I ended up looking at shutting down.

502
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:12,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up trying to find another game to play.

503
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:17,848
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just randomly pulled up Devil's Crush for TurboGrafx.

504
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:27,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Played a little bit of Devil's Crush and then I pulled up... I was going to play the NES Fantasy Zone.

505
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,711
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the NES one, but the TurboGrafx Fantasy Zone.

506
00:40:30,051 --> 00:40:30,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, screw that.

507
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:33,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Super Fantasy Zone for the Genesis Mega Drive.

508
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:35,174
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a little bit of that.

509
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:41,678
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was going to play a little bit of Threads of Fate, which in Japan was called Dew Prism.

510
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cute little RPG.

511
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I was totally into it.

512
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:47,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, wait...

513
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:51,253
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been wanting me to, why don't I just?

514
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did Cult of the Lamb for a while.

515
00:40:54,935 --> 00:41:03,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, so I think, and I'm so mad because I had graphics and everything for Animal Crossing and it looked really good.

516
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so happy.

517
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,722
[SPEAKER_03]: My little chat room said, Dobutsu no Mori Chattonumu.

518
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:12,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even redid like the graphics to make it look the same.

519
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so annoyed.

520
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:18,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was also the premiere of my new retro night graphics.

521
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:20,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Annoyed!

522
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Annoyed!

523
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:28,097
[SPEAKER_03]: RetroNight is back on hold until I think of something else.

524
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I found the video for you and I put it in chat.

525
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:35,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

526
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:37,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

527
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:42,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to find the unedited one because the number one hit is the Eurovision stage.

528
00:41:42,528 --> 00:41:43,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the artist.

529
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:44,109
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one I found.

530
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's the one.

531
00:41:47,212 --> 00:41:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Loki.

532
00:41:47,812 --> 00:41:48,493
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your gaming week?

533
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:49,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you serving?

534
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:51,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Serving?

535
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:52,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

536
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:55,638
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was playing Minecraft.

537
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Minecraft was not the serve.

538
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the serve, not the tea.

539
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:00,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

540
00:42:01,138 --> 00:42:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the T-Hunty, no god.

541
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

542
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:08,467
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was, yeah, I was playing Minecraft this week.

543
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:12,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, as usual, I put out a video earlier this week.

544
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been working on another one.

545
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:20,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, trying to get, like, somewhat weekly content, but I don't think it's going to stay like that because, um,

546
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:22,076
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

547
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,701
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

548
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm anticipating the patch.

549
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:04,070
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally know that there is a patch coming on the 25th.

550
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,511
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a little bit of news on that this week.

551
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:09,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should kind of pump a little more energy into the game.

552
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:12,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I must admit, I've been a little meh on 14 in general.

553
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:16,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been playing it as much, but I do love...

554
00:43:16,738 --> 00:43:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: to collect cosmetics and all that bullshit.

555
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when there's a Moogle Tome event, I'm usually all in on that.

556
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:22,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is that.

557
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:30,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I don't always talk about it, but like at the top of the show, I've been playing a lot of, you know, Ingress, Pikmin, Pokemon, all of it.

558
00:43:31,446 --> 00:43:39,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say my walking ever since Daylight Savings and that it's lighter out again, and I have a newer walking buddy that's been like accountability buddy that's been helping too.

559
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:44,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I have gotten like 10,000 steps in the last week every day.

560
00:43:44,694 --> 00:44:10,259
[SPEAKER_04]: and I kind of want to keep that trend going just to you know for health and all that stuff and it's been great for Pikmin so whenever Bobby does listen to this I carried us on that challenge this week but that's the motive that's I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek because there's been weeks I've been carried like the week I had COVID but I've been very trying to get back into you know using that as motivation to move and do all that good stuff so yeah been having fun with that now one other thing I will mention

561
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Pandora's Box

562
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Harrier

563
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

564
00:45:05,981 --> 00:45:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

565
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:08,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

566
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:11,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, this was a little bit after a bunch of Neo Geo games.

567
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:16,084
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend was like, did you know that there was a Double Dragon fighting game?

568
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:17,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, let's play it.

569
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:18,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So we played that for a little bit.

570
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:24,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, okay, if you're going to make me play Neo Geo fighting games, we will be playing Fatal Fury Special.

571
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:26,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So we played a little bit of that too, because that's one of my favorites.

572
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, did I get bad at that game.

573
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:31,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we were playing King of Fighters, which...

574
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:33,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask me which one.

575
00:45:33,169 --> 00:45:41,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, with this thing having a shit ton of runs, it was like, I know it was like King of Fighters 94, 95, 96, 97, 2000, 2001, Mark of the Wolves.

576
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:42,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

577
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:44,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, I think it was King of Fighters 97.

578
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say is what we were playing.

579
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was like, let's look at random retro games.

580
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the third one.

581
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:52,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of the earlier ones.

582
00:45:52,802 --> 00:45:54,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was like, let's look at random retro games.

583
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And Space Harrier came up.

584
00:45:56,744 --> 00:46:00,206
[SPEAKER_04]: My friend was actually the one that was like, oh my god, have you ever seen Space Harrier?

585
00:46:00,306 --> 00:46:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, bitch, have I ever seen Space Harrier?

586
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:06,329
[SPEAKER_03]: How old is your friend?

587
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe about seven years younger than me.

588
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:11,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Like late 30s.

589
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:13,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And does your friend know about the podcast?

590
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:13,933
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

591
00:46:14,477 --> 00:46:15,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but I don't think has listened.

592
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: So... But, I mean, the simple fact...

593
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:22,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

594
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:23,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a gaming podcast.

595
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:30,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but it's one of those things that I seriously think most... A lot of my friends... Keep in mind, I don't talk about my podcast all the time.

596
00:46:30,715 --> 00:46:31,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud of it.

597
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:36,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share it with friends, but I don't share it in person hanging out at parties all the time.

598
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:37,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a lot of people forget.

599
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:39,079
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like me hosting shows.

600
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,040
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people forget that I do that too.

601
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, you know, oh, yeah, one of my friends was at the Colonial last week and said they saw you.

602
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, it's something I do.

603
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:48,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

604
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:54,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, S2100 Matt in chat says, have you heard of a thing called a Zune, Grandpa?

605
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:55,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

606
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:56,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

607
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

608
00:46:58,662 --> 00:46:59,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at.

609
00:46:59,382 --> 00:46:59,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

610
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:00,203
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

611
00:47:00,783 --> 00:47:02,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have two 8-tracks.

612
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:03,446
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what one of them is?

613
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Please say it's ABBA.

614
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:08,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess if any other albums are rival.

615
00:47:09,771 --> 00:47:10,812
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's Fleetwood Mac.

616
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:12,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's still a good one, though.

617
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still good.

618
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:14,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rumors.

619
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:15,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's a good 8-track to have.

620
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:16,770
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the other one?

621
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was actually, like, I used to have the physical album as a kid, and it's one of the ones that got lost in the hurricane.

622
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:24,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

623
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:24,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

624
00:47:24,714 --> 00:47:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I would listen to Rhiannon on repeat.

625
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:28,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to collect 8-tracks.

626
00:47:29,836 --> 00:47:31,877
[SPEAKER_04]: All these fucking kids today collecting vinyl?

627
00:47:32,418 --> 00:47:33,758
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no kids.

628
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:36,180
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reason no one fucking collects 8-tracks.

629
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know why?

630
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going galaxy-brained.

631
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:39,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Get in the car.

632
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:39,982
[SPEAKER_04]: We're collecting 8-tracks.

633
00:47:40,262 --> 00:47:40,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

634
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever actually physically in your life played an 8-track?

635
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my grandma had one.

636
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:51,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you ever seen what happens to your tapes?

637
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:55,108
[SPEAKER_03]: If one little thing goes bad, they are worse to fix than cassettes.

638
00:47:55,308 --> 00:47:56,408
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we have pencils.

639
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:59,029
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, I know, they're a bitch.

640
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,550
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know, I know, it's a joke.

641
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of do fix them with a pencil, actually, but not like you would with a cassette.

642
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:09,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, children, for those who don't know, 8-tracks...

643
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:11,540
[SPEAKER_03]: are fucking old.

644
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:11,881
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

645
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:12,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.

646
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:13,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they are.

647
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:15,228
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

648
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when video games were on cassette?

649
00:48:20,683 --> 00:48:20,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

650
00:48:21,103 --> 00:48:22,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Look out, Grandpa Rob's on the prowl.

651
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:40,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about the Commodore 64 cassette player so you could play the slinky video game on a cassette after it took 60 minutes, 60 goddamn minutes to play that cassette into your memory on the Commodore 64.

652
00:48:42,148 --> 00:48:49,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, you're letting your Commodore 64 listen to music and then it loads it into the memory and then there you go.

653
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:53,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I got one further for you.

654
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:53,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, I can't wait.

655
00:48:54,767 --> 00:49:00,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Coleco Adam, where the power supply was as big as your house.

656
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,833
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was like the printer of the power supply.

657
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Something would run through the cassette deck.

658
00:49:06,955 --> 00:49:11,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you had any sort of power surge, you could kiss your cassettes goodbye.

659
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:17,661
[SPEAKER_03]: That is why Coleco Adam cassettes that actually work are money.

660
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:22,460
[SPEAKER_03]: And I lived in Alabama.

661
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Put the two together.

662
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:27,643
[SPEAKER_04]: In chat, SSJ100Matt says, clue VCR game for the win.

663
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:28,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 100%.

664
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's bring back VHS games.

665
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:32,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

666
00:49:34,298 --> 00:49:34,738
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

667
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:37,359
[SPEAKER_04]: The government's trying to ban VHS cleaner.

668
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:44,662
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to ban video cleaner because there's totally not another use for video head cleaner that anybody should know about.

669
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:47,123
[SPEAKER_04]: But the government's trying to ban it.

670
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:52,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore, in response, we need to bring back video cassettes and VCR games.

671
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:54,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Clue VCR game is where we start.

672
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:59,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I knew Bobby Blackwolf was good people.

673
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:04,035
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw Bobby Blackwolf owned not only Clue, the VCR game, but Clue 2, Murder in Disguise,

674
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew Bobby Blackwolf was good people.

675
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we've been working with him for 20 years.

676
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I just clue VCR game.

677
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:16,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

678
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:18,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just reading what QuestBuster is saying.

679
00:50:18,336 --> 00:50:19,116
[SPEAKER_03]: How big is that game?

680
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:19,957
[SPEAKER_03]: 9 megabytes?

681
00:50:20,057 --> 00:50:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's only 9 kilobytes.

682
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:23,078
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you guys even play anything?

683
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:28,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep thinking about this story that my friend Krista's dad talked about being an engineer.

684
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,603
[SPEAKER_03]: and, like, was it the late 40s, early 50s, something like that?

685
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:41,550
[SPEAKER_03]: About them lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.

686
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:47,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why those old-ass Atari games are so impressive.

687
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:53,058
[SPEAKER_04]: When you consider, like, how much they pack into such tiny space is wild.

688
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:54,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, totally.

689
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

690
00:50:55,743 --> 00:51:21,171
[SPEAKER_03]: and then like you go and then read about like the 16-bit era how they were trying to you know they made the special chips for the games and increased ram for the games and you basically were running part of the hardware for the console on the on the cartridge you know they were an expansion pack as well as a game that's crazy stuff

691
00:51:22,723 --> 00:51:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: SSU100 Matt in chat says, what was that one creepy VCR game with the creepy guy yelling at you?

692
00:51:27,326 --> 00:51:28,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it was called Nightmare.

693
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:32,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when the guy would randomly pop on the screen and go like, Maggot!

694
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:34,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Maggot!

695
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:35,029
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you call me?

696
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, but, you know, that was what was scary in the 80s was that stuff.

697
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Nightmare.

698
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:46,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had the videotape of How to Beat Games and it was the Metal Gear one.

699
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:49,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just watched it.

700
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:57,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, little did I know that people would make, you know, entire entertainment genres out of those.

701
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:59,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just watching those because they were cool.

702
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:05,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That and it also finally got me how I could beat Top Gun because I could never refuel my plane well.

703
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:08,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, those VHS games came and went in a year.

704
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 1984, they were everywhere.

705
00:52:09,138 --> 00:52:09,358
[SPEAKER_04]: 1985, gone.

706
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:13,862
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just wild how that works.

707
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:14,102
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

708
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we got a game.

709
00:52:15,462 --> 00:52:17,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's, you know, we're- It's games.

710
00:52:17,283 --> 00:52:17,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It counts.

711
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:18,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

712
00:52:18,604 --> 00:52:19,284
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about the game.

713
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a video element.

714
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:25,127
[SPEAKER_04]: We are talking about games from the 1980s, but let's talk about games in 2025 and beyond.

715
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:31,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Real quick before I turn it over to Loki for our first story, I do want to mention to the folks in chat, because I forgot to acknowledge it earlier, I want to say thank you.

716
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:36,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't usually acknowledge all the bits and subs live because we are trying to do a podcast feed, but-

717
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:41,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a very special golden hype train earlier.

718
00:52:41,315 --> 00:52:44,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And those don't happen every... It's like the shinies of hype trains.

719
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:47,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually had a golden hype train that turned up earlier.

720
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:50,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope you all collected your golden kappas from that.

721
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:53,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for your generosity and support.

722
00:52:53,182 --> 00:52:54,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does mean the world to us.

723
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,004
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

724
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:57,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Loki, why don't you start us off with 2025 gaming news?

725
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so 2025 Gaming News.

726
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:11,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, I don't think this is too surprising considering the landscape that we have right now with the Steam Deck and some of these other personal handheld gaming devices.

727
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:42,147
[SPEAKER_07]: but apparently Microsoft is working on releasing one of their own it's actually going to be a reskinned partner PC gaming handheld device running a new software layer not a full-blown Xbox gaming device but it will be something that is essentially running either some sort of Xbox streaming or Xbox powered games, maybe emulation or something like that um

728
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:53,891
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they're calling it Codename Kennen and it's supposed to, you know, feature like similar stuff you would expect with like an Xbox, you know, the guide button.

729
00:53:53,931 --> 00:54:02,959
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have, you know, possible like Series X and S generation type games on there.

730
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:15,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what they come up with certainly I think there are some Xbox games that PC games are probably compatible with the

731
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:35,501
[SPEAKER_07]: even the Steam Deck right now 100% I can imagine that quite a few things could run on there at the very least at Xbox Series S quality and I'm sure you can get a lot more with the games streaming through xCloud and stuff like that 100%

732
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:38,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

733
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:46,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, the rumor is that Asus is the one making the Kennen device.

734
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, they have their own ROG.

735
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:52,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what their handheld's called, but the Strix?

736
00:54:52,928 --> 00:54:53,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's not the Strix.

737
00:54:54,649 --> 00:54:56,590
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, one of the ROG ones that they have.

738
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,052
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a handheld of their own that's very similar to the Steam Deck.

739
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:03,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I guess we'll wait and see.

740
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:07,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be coming out this year, though, at some point.

741
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:15,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think maybe maybe Games Summer Games Fest, you know, now it's been released or something like that.

742
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,934
[SPEAKER_04]: This is I think this is so good for Microsoft.

743
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:19,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

744
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really good direction for them.

745
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:25,936
[SPEAKER_04]: My only reservation is that we're going to have a lot of portable shit pretty soon.

746
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:29,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I can already see my nightstand now is going to have a Steam Deck on it.

747
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:32,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have one of these on it and it's going to have a Switch 2 on it.

748
00:55:33,158 --> 00:55:36,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So I maybe worry a slight bit about handheld fatigue.

749
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:44,165
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think just from like my only concern about this is I think Microsoft should have done this about three years ago, to be quite honest.

750
00:55:44,205 --> 00:55:46,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they let Steam Deck beat them to the punch too much.

751
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:48,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is so smart.

752
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just for Game Pass.

753
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:53,611
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of Game Pass games are not things like Avowed.

754
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And even Avowed, like you said, like in an Xbox S quality will probably run fine.

755
00:55:58,974 --> 00:55:59,895
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

756
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:33,593
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's not just the Game Pass stuff that you download and install on your own system but now cloud gaming whether that be in your own house on Wi-Fi or if they've timed this right in a few years when 5G becomes more prevalent although

757
00:56:34,534 --> 00:56:37,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I've been saying that for about 10 years.

758
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:46,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm starting to wonder if that is really going to happen because I thought by now we would be in a world where there was faster over-the-air internet than cable internet.

759
00:56:47,024 --> 00:56:48,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not fiber, but cable internet.

760
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:51,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not quite where we're at yet.

761
00:56:51,788 --> 00:56:52,868
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

762
00:56:52,908 --> 00:56:57,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what's really holding it up, if it's a lack of competition or whatever the case may be.

763
00:56:57,252 --> 00:56:59,834
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it doesn't seem to be getting...

764
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Faster at all, actually.

765
00:57:02,647 --> 00:57:11,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've seen any sort of... Well, when tariffs are going to make the tech even more important to import, you can just kiss that shit goodbye, but that's another topic.

766
00:57:13,717 --> 00:57:14,797
[SPEAKER_04]: For no reason, mind you.

767
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:15,158
[SPEAKER_04]: None.

768
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:36,513
[SPEAKER_07]: well yeah data caps I don't think are a thing as E3VL mentioned in the sense that I don't think a lot of plans have data caps but they do have certainly data caps in the sense of speed like they'll be like yeah you can use all the internet you want but after 20 gigabytes of data we're gonna throttle that shit

769
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be living back in the 2G land.

770
00:57:55,234 --> 00:58:16,065
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know a handheld device that could do cloud gaming through 5G so you could literally do it anywhere without having to do these big installs and stuff would be huge you know I don't know how far away we are realistically from that but I feel like Xbox getting into this system positions them for that because they can still do all the cloud gaming now too through Xbox

771
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

772
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:17,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

773
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:46,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Shove it full of emulation stuff.

774
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:46,517
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

775
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:48,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Thousands of games you can put on there.

776
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,742
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I don't know.

777
00:58:51,883 --> 00:59:03,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the classroom and stuff just never even now doesn't seem interesting to me just because of the environment that we are in right now where high speed internet is limited in some capacity or

778
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:27,812
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you know we like it or not and we don't have those like you know multi megabit uh gigabit connections or whatever you know multi gigabit connections up and down over the air over you know cable internet or whatever it may be fiber we just don't have that everywhere yet it's not we're not living in that type of environment

779
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

780
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,581
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

781
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:32,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's move on.

782
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:40,703
[SPEAKER_04]: While we see what develops with that, I think you are on the right track that if they are going to announce something, Summer Game Fest, that sort of window, especially in the absence of E3.

783
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:43,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, don't we have a new thing now?

784
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:46,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we talked about that, that it's E3 without the show floor.

785
00:59:47,204 --> 00:59:48,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a thing that's going to happen?

786
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:50,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's going to include conferences.

787
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't assume it would.

788
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:52,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I highly doubt it will.

789
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:53,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

790
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:56,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

791
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:56,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

792
00:59:56,763 --> 00:59:57,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

793
00:59:57,864 --> 00:59:59,444
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC's coming up this week, right?

794
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:00,765
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC's this coming weekend, right?

795
01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:01,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did we miss it?

796
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:03,405
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it's this coming weekend is GDC.

797
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:10,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I seem to remember one of our buddies that does an ancillary event was promoting it for this Thursday.

798
01:00:10,688 --> 01:00:13,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think GDC's this coming week.

799
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:14,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And you never know.

800
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,170
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't get a lot of gaming announcements out of GDC.

801
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that kind of event.

802
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you all know that.

803
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:23,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But once in a while, we get hardware.

804
01:00:24,432 --> 01:00:26,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Sony's announced some hardware there.

805
01:00:26,413 --> 01:00:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it could, but I wouldn't set the expectation there.

806
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:32,056
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could be a nice little present.

807
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:36,878
[SPEAKER_04]: SSU100Matt says, should bring back Game Room for it to be the UI.

808
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

809
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:03,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami did a whole little preview of this game.

810
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think probably the striking difference at first is that instead of having that more like classic New England kind of look of a Silent Hill, you know, traditional game or like a Centralia, Pennsylvania type of look that Silent Hill games have traditionally had, this one is set in 1960s Japan.

811
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:23,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely looks a lot different.

812
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:42,331
[SPEAKER_04]: and instead of maybe the weird like blood and like copper rusty look that Silent Hill has usually when it transforms in this one it looks like it's a little more like floral type of looking and all this I don't know there's a specific thing about the kind of flowers they use oh

813
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:43,531
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

814
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:43,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

815
01:01:43,691 --> 01:01:43,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

816
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:44,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

817
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:32,597
[SPEAKER_03]: um so so yeah that's why this flower is you know important it's significant because it's associated with death reincarnation and mourning uh SSJ100 Matt in chat says Silent Hill fork Matt Matt I say this from the bottom of my heart fork you all right uh

818
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:36,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we know the character in this game.

819
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Shimizu Hinako is going to be the main character, a teenage girl that you're going to be playing as in the game, which for those of you watching us live on Twitch, as we're taping live on this Sunday night, we're playing a little bit of the trailer that they sort of put out with this.

820
01:02:49,676 --> 01:02:53,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We also, you know, add some more further comments from folks that are working on this.

821
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:59,626
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of folks that are kind of like lifetime fans of Silent Hill, like a lot of people in these quotes saying, I played Silent Hill 20 years ago.

822
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:01,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Silent Hill series.

823
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:06,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So Akira Yamaoka is the composer credited here saying,

824
01:03:30,078 --> 01:03:31,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to see how her name is spelled.

825
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,142
[SPEAKER_04]: S-H-I-M-I-Z-U No, no.

826
01:03:35,662 --> 01:03:37,883
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking about the kanji used in Hinako.

827
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:38,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh, oh.

828
01:03:41,366 --> 01:03:44,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Because standardly Hinako would mean like sun child.

829
01:03:45,328 --> 01:03:49,631
[SPEAKER_03]: But I keep thinking of like the Hina Matsuri or the dolls festival.

830
01:03:49,971 --> 01:03:50,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

831
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:50,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

832
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:52,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I don't know.

833
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:55,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the trailer was the I did not watch the entire thing.

834
01:03:55,652 --> 01:04:01,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, like some of the Silent Hill fans in my life were kind of reacting very tepidly to it.

835
01:04:01,479 --> 01:04:04,182
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like this trailer.

836
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:09,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can see where it's like it doesn't look exactly like a Silent Hill game, but I'm cool with them like trying something different.

837
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:11,210
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

838
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:37,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Heaven forbid they're ballsy enough to call it Silent Hills.

839
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:39,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the nerve.

840
01:04:39,566 --> 01:04:41,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the nerve, Bloober.

841
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:41,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

842
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:46,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the nerve to release a game called Silent Hills after everything that's happened in this world.

843
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:47,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

844
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:51,628
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it'll be interesting.

845
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:54,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, interesting.

846
01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:00,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Deft makes a little pun saying Silent Hill F, but with the I-V-E in quotes going Silent Hill 5.

847
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:08,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I remembered, there was some leak stuff on this before, wasn't there?

848
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like most of the leaks ended up being that free-to-play game that came out with all the cyberbullying subplot and all that stuff.

849
01:05:18,016 --> 01:05:20,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some of this before.

850
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:30,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, they announced Silent Hill F a while ago, but all we got was that conceptual floral monster-looking thing, and we didn't get a lot.

851
01:05:30,198 --> 01:05:32,438
[SPEAKER_04]: We just knew it was going to be Silent Hill in Japan.

852
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:35,619
[SPEAKER_04]: This gives us way more of what it actually looks like.

853
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:39,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me wonder if the town that they're in translates to Silent Hill.

854
01:05:41,097 --> 01:05:41,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, maybe.

855
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:43,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

856
01:05:43,459 --> 01:05:43,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

857
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:48,583
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, Aw, you're really gonna do Kojima like that?

858
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:49,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Look.

859
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:54,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Kojima, Kojima is not exactly like having a bad time.

860
01:05:54,895 --> 01:05:57,637
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got Death Stranding 2 happening real soon.

861
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:02,160
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got that other game that with all the people screaming with Udo Kier and that.

862
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,421
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck was that called?

863
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:03,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Overdose.

864
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:05,182
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got that going on.

865
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:07,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Kojima is going to be just fine.

866
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you worry.

867
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you worry, Dark Tetsuya.

868
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:12,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Kojima is going to be A-OK.

869
01:06:15,202 --> 01:06:16,283
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

870
01:06:44,062 --> 01:07:07,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami Arcade stuff still chugging along and still got its fans like Konami whatever was holding them back the managers appear to have been sacked so good for them let's move on to some bad decisions in gaming DarkSakura bad decision was gulping down this meatball

871
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, that's never a bad decision.

872
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:12,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the timing, but meatballs are great.

873
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:12,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

874
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:15,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than it getting kind of stuck.

875
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:22,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the best meatball in my entire fucking life in Florida after getting off that cruise.

876
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:23,841
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to this diner.

877
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:27,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was like an upscale, fancy-ass diner in the middle of Miami.

878
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:30,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, those meatballs.

879
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've had a lot of balls in my mouth over the years.

880
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Meatballs!

881
01:07:35,445 --> 01:07:35,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Meatballs!

882
01:07:36,745 --> 01:07:40,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that they never compared to my friend's Sicilian grandmother.

883
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:41,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's nothing.

884
01:07:42,129 --> 01:07:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: He made meatballs the size of a softball.

885
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:47,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is ever going to top home cooking.

886
01:07:48,492 --> 01:07:48,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

887
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:51,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially a Sicilian grandmother.

888
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:53,155
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

889
01:07:53,275 --> 01:07:53,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

890
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:53,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

891
01:07:54,596 --> 01:08:03,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a leak from Horizon Forbidden West with the main character Aloy as an A.I.,

892
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:12,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Sony employee talking to an AI version of the character.

893
01:08:17,858 --> 01:08:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But the character who voiced her, Ashley Burch, was basically...

894
01:08:27,873 --> 01:08:30,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Unhappy with some of the things.

895
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what she said is that she... I'll just read what her quote is.

896
01:08:35,064 --> 01:08:41,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the tech demo earlier this week and the demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development.

897
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

898
01:08:44,927 --> 01:09:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: and also uh Sony didn't use uh any of her performance so she says none of my facial or voice data Gorilla owns Aloy as a character um then she goes on to say I feel worried not worried about Gorilla specifically or Horizon or my performance or my career specifically even I feel worried about this art form game performance is an art form and then um

899
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:18,264
[SPEAKER_03]: She was talking about the SAG-AFTRA strikes and said that we're asking for protections.

900
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:23,528
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're fighting for is you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form.

901
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:28,053
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you're using this AI double.

902
01:09:29,981 --> 01:09:56,796
[SPEAKER_03]: and she said she doesn't feel worried because of the technology existing but just what people could do with it and so they want people to be protected and have a way to fight back so another quote from her that I really like this says I want to be able to continue to do this job and if we don't win then that future is really compromised I'm genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on Blast certainly not Guerrilla

903
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,358
[SPEAKER_03]: because, again, I don't think the technology is the problem.

904
01:10:01,918 --> 01:10:04,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Game companies wanting to use the technology isn't the problem.

905
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:09,862
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is we are currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.

906
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:16,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much.

907
01:10:18,186 --> 01:10:19,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I agree with that.

908
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:19,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.

909
01:10:19,747 --> 01:10:19,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

910
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:36,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and this is coming after, you know, the whole thing about Microsoft Muse, their generative AI, and just more... It's... I don't know.

911
01:10:37,614 --> 01:10:38,655
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more going on.

912
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:49,117
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you know, what she was referring to with what's going on with the strike and trying to negotiate and the...

913
01:10:50,757 --> 01:11:10,103
[SPEAKER_03]: The opposing party not be willing to give protections is that the studios were including some pretty big loopholes in their bargains.

914
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually just put out a memo saying there were alarming loopholes that will never that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse which is pretty much what started this whole thing to begin with they are really far apart in coming to any kind of agreement

915
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:50,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really... The studios care about money in any way they can to get it.

916
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:54,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And voice actors are a tool for them.

917
01:11:55,654 --> 01:11:57,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And not people doing their job.

918
01:12:00,377 --> 01:12:00,617
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

919
01:12:02,799 --> 01:12:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: but right now some of the studios that they're involved in the negotiations is Disney Character Voices, Activision Blizzard, EA, Warner Brothers, Insomniac, a few others and they said that they had tentative agreements on 24 out of 25 proposals but the SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director their chair Sarah, I'm going to mispronounce this Emily

920
01:12:32,362 --> 01:12:42,227
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote out to the members very recently that the last proposals wouldn't allow the studios to use union members past performances and outside performances without any of the protections that were bargained for.

921
01:12:42,927 --> 01:12:44,528
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're still waiting to get back on that.

922
01:12:44,668 --> 01:12:46,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a bunch of...

923
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:49,759
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot going on, there's a lot going on

924
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:18,186
[SPEAKER_04]: and most of these strikes that we've heard about in other areas, whether it was the writer's strike, blah, blah, blah, were settled within 90 days.

925
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:19,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really worry.

926
01:13:19,587 --> 01:13:32,396
[SPEAKER_04]: This Aloy demo, and I'm sure a lot of you saw it, and I saw it too, it has me worried because I feel like this is the game companies really trying to sort of put out there that, oh, well, we don't need the voice actors.

927
01:13:32,796 --> 01:13:39,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do this with the AI and everything, but let me tell you, and I'm sure many of you saw the demo as well, and I did,

928
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:45,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about y'all, but I was heavily reminded of something else we've seen before.

929
01:13:46,425 --> 01:13:48,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Who remembers Milo?

930
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:50,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone remember Milo?

931
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:53,789
[SPEAKER_04]: What was Milo, Loki?

932
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:54,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember?

933
01:13:55,339 --> 01:14:01,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Milo was the stupid Peter Molyneux thing that they were pushing with the Kinect that was just going to revolutionize everything.

934
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:19,923
[SPEAKER_07]: It was going to be like a real child that you've captured and kidnapped in your own console, and you get to talk to it, and it would have feelings, and it would recognize you, and all this stuff that Peter Molyneux was blowing out his ass because he always promises shit that he can't fucking deliver on all the time, and we now know that he's a fucking liar, but you know what?

935
01:14:20,003 --> 01:14:21,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

936
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give the man credit where it's due.

937
01:14:24,404 --> 01:14:27,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was 10 years ahead of the curve on this.

938
01:14:27,405 --> 01:14:32,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Because let me tell you, I had the same fucking reaction to the Aloy video that I did to Project Milo.

939
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:33,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

940
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:35,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, that's kind of interesting.

941
01:14:36,747 --> 01:14:41,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Artistically, this feels completely soulless and dead.

942
01:14:43,140 --> 01:15:12,481
[SPEAKER_04]: that's how I felt about that performance because like what the fuck even was that Aloy you know in that video is like oh I'm doing okay I just have a little bit of a sore throat how was your day go what the fuck what I'm afraid I can't do that you have a sore throat what the fuck does that have to do with anything in Horizon sorry about your bad day girly but like I just it just doesn't

943
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, E3VL's bringing up Seaman, Seaman, excuse me, Seaman, or Seaman, from the Dreamcast era and how weird that was, too.

944
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:36,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's quite a bit more, you know, just going back to the negotiations, is they're really trying to get the verbiage nailed down.

945
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:37,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

946
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:43,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that verbiage in and of itself is problematic and leading to those loopholes.

947
01:15:43,048 --> 01:15:44,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a chart in chat.

948
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:47,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to find it.

949
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:52,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the comparison chart for SAG-AFTRA.

950
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:53,452
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on SAG-AFTRA.org.

951
01:15:55,112 --> 01:16:02,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what the translation of the contractual text says in real words and then where they are on their gap.

952
01:16:04,756 --> 01:16:08,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty interesting read, but I'll leave it there.

953
01:16:10,614 --> 01:16:17,540
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also more AI crap happening.

954
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:36,554
[SPEAKER_03]: This was another article I was reading just earlier today where Sam Altman was deepfaked for an interview for a documentary that he had not agreed to be interviewed for.

955
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: which should absolutely be pursuable in court.

956
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:40,256
100%.

957
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:43,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.

958
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:53,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, the documentary is about him, but then he ended up making a film called Deep Faking Sam Altman.

959
01:16:53,948 --> 01:16:54,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

960
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:57,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

961
01:16:59,476 --> 01:17:04,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just goes back to my biggest issue with AI is that AI is a tool.

962
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:06,001
[SPEAKER_04]: AI is not a replacement for art.

963
01:17:06,441 --> 01:17:11,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything about that video, like where it was a tool, I guess it was okay.

964
01:17:11,445 --> 01:17:14,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it didn't seem to blow my mind any more than what's already out there on the PS5.

965
01:17:15,127 --> 01:17:18,490
[SPEAKER_04]: But as an art, like again, the voice, soulless.

966
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:23,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like talking to – do you remember when Gigi Goode – I'm going to make everything a Drag Race analogy.

967
01:17:23,554 --> 01:17:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember when Gigi Goode on Drag Race Season 12 did Maria the Robot for Snatch Game?

968
01:17:28,437 --> 01:17:29,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that was great.

969
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:29,738
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that.

970
01:17:29,818 --> 01:17:30,398
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

971
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:35,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what you are talking to in that game is Maria the Robot, which is a real thing.

972
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:38,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually saw at a conference for work once.

973
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not named Maria.

974
01:17:39,544 --> 01:17:41,545
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something else, but it's patented.

975
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:43,526
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, a whole other thing.

976
01:17:43,886 --> 01:17:46,288
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very that.

977
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:48,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, again, completely soulless.

978
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:55,033
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to use AI to design how the monsters move, design the map,

979
01:17:55,853 --> 01:18:03,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Design, well, even to some extent, that can get weird, but design how to hide things or design how the enemy controls some of that.

980
01:18:03,937 --> 01:18:08,779
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing, but to use it as an actual replacement for the art, I just think that's going to end.

981
01:18:08,839 --> 01:18:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you this question, everybody, and especially the folks, because I know we had some AI enthusiasts in chat last week, which is fine.

982
01:18:14,922 --> 01:18:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for healthy dialogue, and I want to be...

983
01:18:18,203 --> 01:18:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be open to some of the things that AI can do, but I just think there's obviously too much that people are trying to shove it into things they shouldn't do.

984
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me ask you this.

985
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:36,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you go watch a movie completely scripted and animated by AI?

986
01:18:37,315 --> 01:18:41,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you rather see that movie or would you rather see Pixar's next movie?

987
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:43,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I have that through.

988
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:46,551
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those companies.

989
01:18:46,571 --> 01:18:50,460
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was free, I would actually see the AI movie just to raz it.

990
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,003
[SPEAKER_07]: They have one.

991
01:18:52,063 --> 01:18:52,704
[SPEAKER_07]: They have one.

992
01:18:52,865 --> 01:18:54,629
[SPEAKER_07]: It's through like...

993
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,549
[SPEAKER_07]: They had one, it was like a love story or something like that.

994
01:18:59,629 --> 01:19:02,051
[SPEAKER_07]: It was absolutely looked like dog shit.

995
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:07,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember that whole Seinfeld thing on Twitch that got banned.

996
01:19:07,455 --> 01:19:08,395
[SPEAKER_07]: That's funny.

997
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:15,140
[SPEAKER_07]: That was funny in the sense that it looks horrible and it was just people were watching because they knew it was horrible.

998
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:18,182
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't watching like, oh, this is new Seinfeld episodes.

999
01:19:18,202 --> 01:19:19,143
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't looking at it like that.

1000
01:19:19,163 --> 01:19:26,028
[SPEAKER_07]: They were just looking at the meme-ability of the insane things that the AI would say because it goes off the rails so quickly.

1001
01:19:26,448 --> 01:19:28,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Assistive AI versus generative AI.

1002
01:19:42,922 --> 01:19:46,325
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.

1003
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:46,325
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.

1004
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:46,325
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a very good way of putting it.

1005
01:19:46,405 --> 01:19:48,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pro-assistive AI.

1006
01:19:48,908 --> 01:19:55,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'm going to say I'm anti-generative AI because I think there's some situations when it's more like the Google 2.0 type of thing.

1007
01:19:55,595 --> 01:19:57,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with it, but it's not a replacement.

1008
01:19:57,938 --> 01:19:59,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never a replacement for art.

1009
01:20:01,141 --> 01:20:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So did you see this?

1010
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've seen this or not.

1011
01:20:03,682 --> 01:20:07,063
[SPEAKER_07]: This was on the TCL channel, which I did.

1012
01:20:07,263 --> 01:20:09,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like the garbage TV stuff that comes in.

1013
01:20:10,964 --> 01:20:15,645
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is an example of an actual AI movie that is entirely AI.

1014
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:17,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like it.

1015
01:20:17,565 --> 01:20:18,486
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this shit?

1016
01:20:18,806 --> 01:20:19,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to look at it.

1017
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:21,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I stop Paris?

1018
01:20:21,827 --> 01:20:23,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe after the show.

1019
01:20:23,307 --> 01:20:23,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1020
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:24,867
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks bad.

1021
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:26,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you can...

1022
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:39,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of that AI dialogue always strikes me as, of course, we all remember the greatest cartoon ever made, which was rejected by Don Hertzfeld, a staple of Spike and Mike's Twisted and Sick Festival of Animation.

1023
01:20:40,558 --> 01:20:42,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you all remember that sequence.

1024
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then you know the sequence that goes, Tuesday's coming.

1025
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring your coat?

1026
01:20:48,145 --> 01:20:49,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a banana.

1027
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:50,647
[SPEAKER_04]: My spoon is too big.

1028
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,030
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what fucking AI dialogue sounds like to me.

1029
01:20:54,918 --> 01:20:57,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That's literally what those movies sound like to me.

1030
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:57,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway.

1031
01:20:58,499 --> 01:20:58,779
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1032
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:00,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough of that.

1033
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:04,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, though, one last thing.

1034
01:21:05,202 --> 01:21:13,465
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my extreme caution to the game industry on this.

1035
01:21:14,841 --> 01:21:15,822
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1036
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:47,182
[SPEAKER_04]: If you allow the voice of Aloy to be completely AI generated, I'm going to tell you what a lot of very disturbed people and gamers on X are going to do.

1037
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:54,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Aloy, would you pretty please say a slur just for me, just between friends?

1038
01:21:54,807 --> 01:21:59,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you tell a naughty joke that you shouldn't say in public just between friends?

1039
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:08,920
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going to try their damnedest to get Aloy to say very bad things.

1040
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And you all know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about.

1041
01:22:11,423 --> 01:22:12,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to elaborate.

1042
01:22:12,424 --> 01:22:15,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even think they need to try that hard to do that.

1043
01:22:15,628 --> 01:22:16,890
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a big problem.

1044
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: have you heard the latest argument now that they're trying to make in court these AI companies are trying to convince the court that copyrighted material should be it should be fair use for them to train their AI algorithms on it oh well then if that's the case copyrighted material should be free for me to perform at any time exactly like if that gets passed through that oh yeah it's okay to train your stuff on this okay well then it's free game for everything right

1045
01:22:47,292 --> 01:23:03,568
[SPEAKER_07]: or is it just that billion dollar companies, after they've already and mind you, they aren't asking permission up front, they've already done this, this is a thing they've already done, this is their defense in court saying that, oh we shouldn't be punished for stealing all this stuff, mind you that

1046
01:23:04,269 --> 01:23:04,449
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1047
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:11,459
[SPEAKER_07]: How many thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars were they suing people for downloading a song off Napster or something like that?

1048
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:17,488
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, oh hey, I can steal the entire works of every single artist out there and it's fine.

1049
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw, you have some gold star comments once in a while, I'm really going to say.

1050
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:28,260
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw says, so someone could have her say the C word?

1051
01:23:29,481 --> 01:23:30,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they could.

1052
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:35,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Aloy, I really enjoy that song that Malta put in Eurovision.

1053
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:36,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you sing the lyrics with me?

1054
01:23:38,322 --> 01:23:38,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't.

1055
01:23:38,802 --> 01:23:39,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Malta's a cunt.

1056
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:43,683
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she's not.

1057
01:23:43,723 --> 01:23:45,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never met the woman.

1058
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:47,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just... I'm just talking about singing.

1059
01:23:49,011 --> 01:23:56,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Fit Dream says, I think they'd pre-record and release only curated things, not just give Aloy to the general public.

1060
01:23:57,585 --> 01:24:03,194
[SPEAKER_04]: If having a sore throat was a curated statement, I question who's writing those curated statements.

1061
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:05,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1062
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:10,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I too hope they do not replace the scripting and the voicing with AI.

1063
01:24:10,744 --> 01:24:11,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I too am there.

1064
01:24:12,505 --> 01:24:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want to use AI to jumpstart what that might look like, but don't replace the people that make it fluid.

1065
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:21,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, anyway.

1066
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I can't with human people.

1067
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:26,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't?

1068
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:31,634
[SPEAKER_04]: People are not serving Kant right now.

1069
01:24:31,714 --> 01:24:32,214
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not.

1070
01:24:32,992 --> 01:24:35,135
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they're serving extra, which is the problem.

1071
01:24:35,935 --> 01:24:38,458
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1072
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:46,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to another story about a series that will finally be serving us something after like 13 years, right, Loki?

1073
01:24:49,071 --> 01:24:53,094
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

1074
01:24:53,214 --> 01:25:05,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know, what was the last remake of Elder Scrolls, a remaster or whatever that came out not that long ago?

1075
01:25:05,963 --> 01:25:14,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so it's been rumored for a while that Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion is going to be remade here pretty soon, and...

1076
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:43,678
[SPEAKER_07]: apparently it has been confirmed it is actually happening but there's now leaks saying that it's going to be announced very soon and that'll be coming out in June as well also along with the the leaks from I guess an insider NateTheHate also that they're going to be working on overhauling some of the systems in Oblivion as well including like the stamina system react

1077
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:51,401
[SPEAKER_07]: and the melee and archery combat to make it a little bit more improved and less irritating.

1078
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:53,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So cool.

1079
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:54,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that happens.

1080
01:25:55,643 --> 01:26:05,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll get this all, you know, I could see this as one of those things and it's out now type thing that after their Microsoft's

1081
01:26:06,516 --> 01:26:09,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Live show or semi-live show or whatever the case may be.

1082
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:13,823
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like one of those now type announcements.

1083
01:26:13,984 --> 01:26:16,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope this is the thing sooner rather than later, too.

1084
01:26:17,187 --> 01:26:18,789
[SPEAKER_04]: This this would be great.

1085
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:23,613
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to play a reworked Oblivion that kind of brings some of the modern stuff into it.

1086
01:26:23,674 --> 01:26:25,756
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just a little bit of quality of life juggling.

1087
01:26:26,076 --> 01:26:27,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be a great thing.

1088
01:26:27,517 --> 01:26:28,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do hope it's true.

1089
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:29,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.

1090
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:35,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, if Patrick Stewart is still the voice of, what was his name, Uriel?

1091
01:26:35,975 --> 01:26:36,836
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy in the very beginning?

1092
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:38,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be into that.

1093
01:26:38,939 --> 01:26:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1094
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:40,481
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1095
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:47,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on, I'm sorry, but we have yet another AI story, but this is where the gaming world is right now.

1096
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:50,578
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's interesting.

1097
01:26:50,758 --> 01:26:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hate this one, and I'm going to explain why.

1098
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't, because I don't think people are going to use it the way they think, and I'll explain why.

1099
01:26:59,306 --> 01:27:01,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is making a co-pilot...

1100
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:04,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Assistant for Games.

1101
01:27:05,091 --> 01:27:07,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, of course, going to use AI because that's what Copilot does.

1102
01:27:08,254 --> 01:27:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some conceptual videos with little, that means artistically rendered pop-ups that come up, but not something that is actually running in real time.

1103
01:27:17,342 --> 01:27:24,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But things like, let's imagine that you're playing Minecraft and you were to ask Copilot, okay, I've got some wood.

1104
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:25,530
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do with that?

1105
01:27:27,202 --> 01:27:33,548
[SPEAKER_04]: and CoPilot answers, stroke the wood slowly back and forth because AI doesn't understand nuance.

1106
01:27:34,168 --> 01:27:42,596
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but in this artistic render, it says, craft the oak logs into wooden planks by opening your inventory and placing the logs in the crafting area.

1107
01:27:42,676 --> 01:27:46,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's basically game tips as you play the game.

1108
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:51,083
[SPEAKER_07]: God forbid Mojang is going to put a tutorial in their games.

1109
01:27:51,203 --> 01:27:55,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's add all these new game mechanics and not explain any of it to anybody.

1110
01:27:55,686 --> 01:27:58,408
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the internet is for.

1111
01:27:58,588 --> 01:28:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Another example in the video showed Copilot recommending a hero in Overwatch 2 to compliment the other folks on the team.

1112
01:28:07,093 --> 01:28:09,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Answering questions about Minecraft and all this other stuff.

1113
01:28:10,636 --> 01:28:16,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Copilot will be able to see your game screen via an app integration to offer the guidance in games real time.

1114
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:17,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

1115
01:28:18,221 --> 01:28:23,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I don't necessarily hate this because I feel like so many people do this anyway.

1116
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:24,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I do this.

1117
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:28,689
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I do differently than the AI is just I have a Google window up.

1118
01:28:29,289 --> 01:28:33,192
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I find the XYZ item in Final Fantasy XIV?

1119
01:28:33,573 --> 01:28:36,174
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the farming locations for this?

1120
01:28:36,295 --> 01:28:38,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything I'm doing here is just Googling it.

1121
01:28:39,557 --> 01:28:44,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this co-pilot is just now I'm Googling it with my voice and it shows up on screen with the game...

1122
01:28:45,191 --> 01:28:48,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, is it going to get it right 100% of the time?

1123
01:28:48,793 --> 01:28:50,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee you it's not.

1124
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:54,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is, are people actually going to use this?

1125
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Because did you all forget?

1126
01:28:57,837 --> 01:29:03,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Or as Kathy Bates once famously said in the movie Misery, have you all got amnesia?

1127
01:29:04,301 --> 01:29:06,562
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't get out of the cock-a-doodie car!

1128
01:29:09,525 --> 01:29:15,048
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 5 touted something very similar to this when it came out.

1129
01:29:15,688 --> 01:29:21,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't AI, but it was little short videos showing you how to unlock trophies.

1130
01:29:21,892 --> 01:29:22,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop quiz, folks.

1131
01:29:23,573 --> 01:29:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time any of you PlayStation 5 owners used that feature?

1132
01:29:29,056 --> 01:29:32,238
[SPEAKER_04]: When was the last time you saw a game that had that supported in it?

1133
01:29:33,399 --> 01:29:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll wait.

1134
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:38,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played a PS5.

1135
01:29:38,788 --> 01:29:40,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a PS5.

1136
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: People are probably just not going to use it.

1137
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:54,954
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to give people incentive to use this.

1138
01:29:55,355 --> 01:29:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the top incentives would be to make sure it's always giving accurate information.

1139
01:30:00,276 --> 01:30:05,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, this is where the gaming industry is its own worst enemy.

1140
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,379
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see me, but I'm tapping the desk.

1141
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:08,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping the sound comes through.

1142
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:14,702
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where the game industry is its own worst enemy because games are constantly being patched.

1143
01:30:15,282 --> 01:30:20,504
[SPEAKER_04]: upgraded, changed, microtransacted, morphed, and all of that.

1144
01:30:20,845 --> 01:30:25,607
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times when you want to Google the answer to a question, how do I find XYZ?

1145
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:29,148
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer you get was true three patches ago.

1146
01:30:31,629 --> 01:30:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you bet this thing runs into the same problem, rendering it useless?

1147
01:30:39,588 --> 01:30:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Mish says, I use it all the time.

1148
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:45,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently using it on Stellar Blade and Horizon Forbidden West.

1149
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:46,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, shut me up.

1150
01:30:47,053 --> 01:30:51,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just feel like it's a totally underused type of feature, type of thing.

1151
01:30:52,237 --> 01:30:56,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Fifth Dream says, I never used it because I'm good at games.

1152
01:30:58,982 --> 01:30:59,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's funny.

1153
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:00,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good troll.

1154
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:01,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good troll answer.

1155
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:01,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1156
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:05,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Fifth Dream says, they call that backseating on Twitch.

1157
01:31:05,907 --> 01:31:07,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people ban for it.

1158
01:31:07,668 --> 01:31:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm

1159
01:31:09,656 --> 01:31:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, and Deft actually sees benefit.

1160
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:18,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Deft goes, I need that co-pilot stuff on Overwatch now so my teammates don't fuck up.

1161
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is assistive AI versus generative AI.

1162
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:26,173
[SPEAKER_04]: My only concern with this is, is it really going to assist people?

1163
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:30,482
[SPEAKER_04]: But conceptually, I don't hate it.

1164
01:31:31,224 --> 01:31:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's any... I think people use deadly boss mods.

1165
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and people Google shit all the time.

1166
01:31:37,473 --> 01:31:40,618
[SPEAKER_04]: So fine, put that on the screen, but just don't expect it to be right.

1167
01:31:43,222 --> 01:31:43,503
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1168
01:31:44,938 --> 01:31:49,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless maybe it trains off of documentations the developers provided if they want to.

1169
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:51,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Then maybe that could get interesting.

1170
01:31:51,681 --> 01:31:52,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1171
01:31:53,482 --> 01:31:55,423
[SPEAKER_03]: ChatGTP fueled game facts.

1172
01:31:56,283 --> 01:32:00,165
[SPEAKER_04]: So I realize this might surprise you as much as we've talked about AI on this show.

1173
01:32:00,185 --> 01:32:04,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say this co-pilot AI thing, I don't hate it.

1174
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm skeptical if it's really going to work.

1175
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:07,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

1176
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:09,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe in five years it's a little different.

1177
01:32:11,027 --> 01:32:11,928
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1178
01:32:12,008 --> 01:32:17,872
[SPEAKER_04]: SheHulk wants to point out, Xbox already has true achievements integrated to help with achievements, and it works great.

1179
01:32:18,692 --> 01:32:30,160
[SPEAKER_04]: QuestBuster says, I've used YouTube build guides for Diablo 4 and The First Descendant because I don't have weeks to figure out the math behind what does what after wondering what my tune hits like a wet noodle and where I went wrong.

1180
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:35,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give these guys a free plug, but this is the personal site I use for Diablo 4.

1181
01:32:35,463 --> 01:32:36,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called MaxRoll.

1182
01:32:36,824 --> 01:32:37,865
[SPEAKER_04]: MaxRoll.gg.

1183
01:32:38,445 --> 01:32:39,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Icy Veins is another good backup.

1184
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:40,026
[SPEAKER_04]: MaxRoll.gg.

1185
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:46,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I'm telling you that versus YouTube is that Max Roll automatically updates with every single season and every single patch.

1186
01:32:47,147 --> 01:32:48,948
[SPEAKER_04]: There are little nerds and a complimentary.

1187
01:32:49,268 --> 01:32:52,668
[SPEAKER_04]: There are nerds that crunch all the numbers, do that with every season.

1188
01:32:52,728 --> 01:32:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they build all the builds.

1189
01:32:54,049 --> 01:32:55,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I use for Diablo 4.

1190
01:32:56,809 --> 01:32:58,309
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube has that.

1191
01:32:58,709 --> 01:33:01,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It's outdated by the time the next patch comes out problem.

1192
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:04,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless maybe you're checking your created by dates.

1193
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if your created date was within the last couple of weeks, that's probably okay.

1194
01:33:07,071 --> 01:33:07,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1195
01:33:09,138 --> 01:33:14,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway, let's move on to something we're going to see a lot of YouTube tours on in the not-too-distant future.

1196
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:15,141
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

1197
01:33:17,442 --> 01:33:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think it's going to be time for a field trip soon because the Nintendo store in San Francisco is opening on...

1198
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:28,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Already.

1199
01:33:30,322 --> 01:33:31,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It opened yesterday.

1200
01:33:32,684 --> 01:33:43,971
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Nintendo store open in San Francisco and it is located at 331 Powell Street at the corner of Powell and Geary in Union Square.

1201
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:45,652
[SPEAKER_03]: We know where that is.

1202
01:33:47,093 --> 01:33:49,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the second retail location in the U.S.

1203
01:33:49,354 --> 01:33:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Not off the top of my brain.

1204
01:33:50,455 --> 01:33:52,136
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it's 331 Powell Street?

1205
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Corner of Powell and Geary.

1206
01:33:55,358 --> 01:33:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1207
01:33:57,219 --> 01:33:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1208
01:33:59,167 --> 01:34:01,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but it's 331 Powell Street.

1209
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think it's going to be time for a field trip soon.

1210
01:34:06,853 --> 01:34:09,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Except, don't you have to get on a waiting list or something?

1211
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I remember that's a thing.

1212
01:34:11,837 --> 01:34:14,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anything about a waiting list.

1213
01:34:15,601 --> 01:34:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I saw something online about that they're going to have people sign up for a waiting list.

1214
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,106
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't even a full article.

1215
01:34:22,766 --> 01:34:23,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hold on.

1216
01:34:23,887 --> 01:34:25,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to Nintendo's website.

1217
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1218
01:34:29,534 --> 01:34:32,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, no phone number listed, nothing.

1219
01:34:32,577 --> 01:34:33,138
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

1220
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm doing a little magic travel here to see where this is, to see if it jogs my memory.

1221
01:34:39,405 --> 01:34:41,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is right there in Union Square.

1222
01:34:41,067 --> 01:34:42,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So it must be this space here.

1223
01:34:42,748 --> 01:34:44,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Your brand here, retail.

1224
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:47,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine all these people that are going to soon live on top of the Nintendo store?

1225
01:34:48,375 --> 01:34:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine?

1226
01:34:49,676 --> 01:34:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be wild.

1227
01:34:50,796 --> 01:34:55,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Palangiri, unless it's on this side, it could be on this side of it.

1228
01:34:55,618 --> 01:34:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I think this is 331 right here.

1229
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It is literally right across from Union Square.

1230
01:35:01,841 --> 01:35:06,903
[SPEAKER_04]: This big building in the back, that's the huge Macy's building, I'm pretty sure, with the Cheesecake Factory on the roof.

1231
01:35:07,503 --> 01:35:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, there's a Nintendo bus going by.

1232
01:35:10,264 --> 01:35:11,845
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Saks.

1233
01:35:11,885 --> 01:35:13,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is the Macy's.

1234
01:35:14,106 --> 01:35:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit, it's across the street from that Macy's.

1235
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:22,469
[SPEAKER_03]: We have videos from NBC Bay Area.

1236
01:35:22,849 --> 01:35:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shoot.

1237
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1238
01:35:26,193 --> 01:35:26,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fill you in.

1239
01:35:27,474 --> 01:35:33,000
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, all I really need to know is it's literally across the street from Union Square Macy's.

1240
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Fun fact, Alan and I had our first date in Union Square many, many years ago.

1241
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:38,826
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1242
01:35:39,307 --> 01:35:40,488
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm trying to remember, what was that?

1243
01:35:41,926 --> 01:35:44,228
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that building before?

1244
01:35:44,768 --> 01:35:45,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, I don't remember.

1245
01:35:46,309 --> 01:35:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's right in the heart of everything.

1246
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm all for a field trip if we can go.

1247
01:35:50,432 --> 01:35:56,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, you know, I'm sure this place is going to get slammed in the first month, but then hopefully it kind of chills out after some time.

1248
01:35:56,496 --> 01:36:04,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time summer rolls around, Memorial Day, that whole type of thing, hopefully it's, well, maybe not as soon as Memorial Day, but hopefully by the time summer rolls around, like my birthday, SF Pride.

1249
01:36:05,623 --> 01:36:06,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't like SF Pride.

1250
01:36:07,024 --> 01:36:08,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, it is the, your...

1251
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:11,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Your brand here place.

1252
01:36:11,871 --> 01:36:12,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it is.

1253
01:36:12,393 --> 01:36:12,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1254
01:36:13,516 --> 01:36:13,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1255
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Still, it looks like a nice building.

1256
01:36:16,786 --> 01:36:16,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1257
01:36:18,382 --> 01:36:21,845
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Macy's that gives out all the Armani makeup samples just like if you ask for it.

1258
01:36:41,112 --> 01:36:41,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's nice.

1259
01:36:42,273 --> 01:36:43,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1260
01:36:43,393 --> 01:36:46,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I've bought many a wardrobe at that Macy's actually.

1261
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:53,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's so big, they have large amounts of the collections of all the strange brands that you can get.

1262
01:36:53,779 --> 01:36:56,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Like International Concepts, which is a Macy's brand I love.

1263
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:59,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I get a lot of my eccentric hosting outfits through that.

1264
01:37:00,343 --> 01:37:02,264
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a ton of it at the San Francisco one.

1265
01:37:02,404 --> 01:37:03,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I like to go there.

1266
01:37:05,045 --> 01:37:05,245
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1267
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:07,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's move on.

1268
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:08,107
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go back over to Loki.

1269
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:14,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so BlizzCon is not coming back this year.

1270
01:37:14,489 --> 01:37:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: They are skipping 2025, but they're going to return next year.

1271
01:37:20,531 --> 01:37:25,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently they don't have a lot to announce or something, at least in the physical form, I don't know.

1272
01:37:27,776 --> 01:37:48,353
[SPEAKER_07]: but yeah it says uh apparently they confirmed that the they're going to be returning on September 12th and was it they're doing the um events gonna be I guess returning in 2026 on the September 12th and ending on September 13th and they're not selling tickets yet for it um

1273
01:37:50,475 --> 01:37:54,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they said when BlizzCon returns in 2020... Oh, here we go.

1274
01:37:54,237 --> 01:37:55,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the full statement.

1275
01:37:55,297 --> 01:38:05,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it says BlizzCon is back and... Nothing really... No real details on what's going to change just other than they're going to be delaying it a year, I guess.

1276
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:15,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, it, it, well, I think you're going along the right line of thinking is that they probably just don't have a lot to announce this year.

1277
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:18,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we know there's probably going to be a new World of Warcraft expansion.

1278
01:38:18,678 --> 01:38:22,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we know there is one coming because remember they announced three in a row, right?

1279
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:26,402
[SPEAKER_04]: They announced War Within, Midnight, uh, what was the other one?

1280
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember now, but there was a third expansion.

1281
01:38:28,543 --> 01:38:28,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, folks.

1282
01:38:28,963 --> 01:38:29,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1283
01:38:29,963 --> 01:38:33,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so we know that that's because this is going to be the one that has player housing and all that stuff.

1284
01:38:34,165 --> 01:38:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1285
01:38:53,766 --> 01:39:22,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they know better than to throw a BlizzCon for a mobile phone game I think they learned that lesson so I don't think it'll be that maybe something in the StarCraft universe ooh, didn't we have the rumors about not StarCraft Ghost but basically StarCraft Ghost kind of making a comeback, that concept of StarCraft coming back as a shooter I wonder I wonder maybe that's the thing that they're finally going to be ready to show in 2026 that they're ramping up to

1286
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:44,854
[SPEAKER_04]: so we'll see E3VL says Overwatch roadmap you know we might have a major Overwatch revision dare I say Overwatch 3 but I feel like Blizzard's kind of had their statement on why maybe how about this I'm not even going to say Overwatch 3 I'm going to say finally some Overwatch PVE finally some Overwatch PVE maybe like a spinoff thing I don't know I don't know

1287
01:39:46,926 --> 01:40:08,636
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe I'm getting a little wacky wild there but I'd be curious to see what they might have come but I don't think that I mean obviously they're not going to have anything Diablo outside of a new expansion they'll have their regular expansion to the card game Hearthstone we already know what's going on in Warcraft so I feel like it has to be something Starcraft or something completely new

1288
01:40:10,632 --> 01:40:11,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

1289
01:40:11,632 --> 01:40:13,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess we'll wait and see.

1290
01:40:13,653 --> 01:40:15,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but not this year.

1291
01:40:15,953 --> 01:40:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's talk about, this is a very interesting phenomenon that a lot of people are talking about across a lot of gaming blogs and things like that this week, is that Super Nintendo consoles, and I mean the old school fucking brick consoles from 1991 that still fucking work because they used to make consoles really well back then.

1292
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:38,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a really disgusting color, but those things do work, right?

1293
01:40:39,020 --> 01:40:39,160
[SPEAKER_04]: But

1294
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,382
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some interesting things going on with the Super Nintendo hardware.

1295
01:40:42,482 --> 01:40:48,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the console is actually getting faster as it gets older.

1296
01:40:49,527 --> 01:40:51,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ever so slight.

1297
01:40:51,949 --> 01:40:58,234
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, there is what's called the SMP speed ROM test that you can run with a flash cart.

1298
01:40:58,734 --> 01:41:07,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And through 143 users participating in a TASBOT survey over on BlueSky at TAS.BOT.com,

1299
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: was running this test over on Blue Sky, said, can people run this?

1300
01:41:11,984 --> 01:41:16,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on the results, Super Nintendo has confirmed it is running faster.

1301
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,710
[SPEAKER_04]: The audio processing unit, or the APU, runs faster.

1302
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:24,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the DSP rate averages 32,076 hertz, rising 8 hertz from cold to warm.

1303
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:31,599
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1304
01:41:53,760 --> 01:42:08,027
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you are talking a frame by frame speedrun assisted bot doing this instead, I could see where every frame really can matter and make or break these speedruns.

1305
01:42:08,648 --> 01:42:13,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is probably very fascinating as far as being able to run these things on original hardware.

1306
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they better with age, like a fine wine?

1307
01:42:16,272 --> 01:42:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

1308
01:42:18,157 --> 01:42:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on how you look at it.

1309
01:42:19,038 --> 01:42:20,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the hardware is breaking down.

1310
01:42:20,178 --> 01:42:22,040
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just breaking down in a way that benefits.

1311
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's breaking down in a weird way.

1312
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:24,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Speeding up.

1313
01:42:24,562 --> 01:42:24,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1314
01:42:24,982 --> 01:42:30,346
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't mean it's like, it's not how it's supposed to operate.

1315
01:42:30,426 --> 01:42:36,910
[SPEAKER_04]: As a joke, I'm out with another joke saying, so what you're saying is Super Nintendo finally got its blast processing update after 35 years.

1316
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:37,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1317
01:42:37,811 --> 01:42:38,532
[SPEAKER_03]: For fuck's sake.

1318
01:42:39,032 --> 01:42:39,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1319
01:42:40,833 --> 01:42:41,214
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1320
01:42:42,494 --> 01:42:44,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough of you clowns in chat.

1321
01:42:44,596 --> 01:42:45,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1322
01:42:45,597 --> 01:42:46,998
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, it's specifically Matt.

1323
01:42:47,038 --> 01:42:47,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically.

1324
01:42:49,517 --> 01:42:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say clown, I mean Matt.

1325
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,445
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, moving on.

1326
01:42:54,627 --> 01:42:59,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do the classic game of the week, whether it's sped up or not.

1327
01:43:10,245 --> 01:43:17,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1328
01:43:17,993 --> 01:43:20,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1329
01:43:21,876 --> 01:43:24,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And what did you pick for the game this week, DarkSakura?

1330
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:26,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of a deep cut.

1331
01:43:27,725 --> 01:43:28,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really?

1332
01:43:28,585 --> 01:43:29,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1333
01:43:29,265 --> 01:43:29,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1334
01:43:29,806 --> 01:43:32,106
[SPEAKER_03]: People know that I'm a fan of the series.

1335
01:43:32,286 --> 01:43:33,086
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

1336
01:43:33,506 --> 01:43:33,746
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

1337
01:43:33,926 --> 01:43:44,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the game that I picked is Keio Yuugekitai Katsugekihen, which is the sequel to the last Keio Flying Squadron.

1338
01:43:45,569 --> 01:43:50,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, this came out on the Saturn in 1996.

1339
01:43:50,971 --> 01:43:53,791
[SPEAKER_03]: There also was a European release.

1340
01:43:53,891 --> 01:43:55,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not get this in the US.

1341
01:43:57,512 --> 01:44:00,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's okay.

1342
01:44:00,895 --> 01:44:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a cute game.

1343
01:44:01,976 --> 01:44:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.

1344
01:44:03,017 --> 01:44:06,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very Japanese culture heavy.

1345
01:44:07,782 --> 01:44:08,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll get back into that.

1346
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:15,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So the original Keio Yugekitai, or Keio Flying Squadron, was a shimupi.

1347
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:16,790
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is a platformer.

1348
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:37,357
[SPEAKER_03]: and um it also of course like the last game it it has a very big Japanese culture influence but also ancient and modern at the same time it's an interesting little universe that these characters live in so at any rate um a year after Keio Yu Gekitai

1349
01:44:39,158 --> 01:44:51,889
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some major economic consequences, and so there were public works set in place for the new Edo Castle, because they live in Edo, which was the original name for Tokyo as the Japanese capital.

1350
01:44:51,989 --> 01:44:53,771
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

1351
01:44:54,171 --> 01:45:07,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Pon Eho is a tanuki with a genius IQ of 1400, but he had to labor, and he found some scrolls that show where to find six magical orbs or jewels in the Japanese version.

1352
01:45:07,722 --> 01:45:26,361
[SPEAKER_03]: and so he'd gather the orbs to get, you know, treasure so he left and went to search for the orbs and then the main character for KO Flying Squadron is Rami Nanahikari

1353
01:45:27,291 --> 01:45:49,136
[SPEAKER_03]: and their family is having dinner and then the 13th queen of Yamatai Koku named Himiko Yamatai which is another historical name for this famed ancient princess Yamatai was the name that was given to Japan I think by China

1354
01:45:50,276 --> 01:45:51,277
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1355
01:46:09,938 --> 01:46:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Rami is actually the grandchild of an ancient family and descendant of aliens that came to Earth.

1356
01:46:17,867 --> 01:46:22,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she wears her bunny suit, which is the formal attire of a key guardian.

1357
01:46:22,712 --> 01:46:24,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And that explains the outfit.

1358
01:46:25,935 --> 01:46:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so like I said, for those in chat...

1359
01:46:31,949 --> 01:46:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone who's watching the video it it's a platformer and you go around and you fight a bunch of like tanuki and other creatures and uh rob if you skip up to uh the second time stamp uh one of the boss battles sorry i have to look up what it was again hold on uh 1441 i remember it because the number oh damn go you okay thank you

1360
01:46:57,847 --> 01:47:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah but anyway um you have these cut scenes in it and like so she's coming up in the middle of a like a sumo competition and and they're like no you can't go and she's like watch me and so she has to fight a uh a sumo who gets like encased in a um uh I can see the name in my head Daruma

1361
01:47:25,143 --> 01:47:28,470
[SPEAKER_03]: and she has to fight the giant Daruma.

1362
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's absolutely silly.

1363
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this game is hilarious.

1364
01:47:35,323 --> 01:47:35,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And

1365
01:47:37,585 --> 01:47:39,627
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I've seen copies of this game.

1366
01:47:39,647 --> 01:47:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The cheapest I saw was like $150.

1367
01:47:42,049 --> 01:47:45,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So not like super, super high crazy, but still high crazy.

1368
01:47:46,353 --> 01:47:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, Rami can also get different weapons.

1369
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:58,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are still like a couple of shmup levels.

1370
01:47:59,884 --> 01:48:06,309
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other things that she can get called the Homing Spot Junior.

1371
01:48:06,909 --> 01:48:08,770
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get those only as bonuses.

1372
01:48:10,371 --> 01:48:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as the other stages, there's a vertically scrolling bonus stage, a roller coaster stage, an underwater stage.

1373
01:48:17,096 --> 01:48:19,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty much a multi-genre platformer.

1374
01:48:19,978 --> 01:48:23,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the bonuses that you can collect are three weapons.

1375
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Atami, the Hammer of Dreams, which is a large mallet.

1376
01:48:28,123 --> 01:48:37,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinugawa, which is the Umbrella of Hope, an umbrella that you can hit enemies with or float or deflect overhead obstacles.

1377
01:48:38,568 --> 01:48:43,590
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kunsatsu, the Arrow of Hope, which is a bow and arrow, and you can just shoot people.

1378
01:48:44,190 --> 01:48:50,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bounce on the heads of enemies, and then you can use kappa to reach higher places.

1379
01:48:50,052 --> 01:48:52,573
[SPEAKER_03]: The kappa are, well, turtle demons.

1380
01:48:53,934 --> 01:48:54,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1381
01:48:55,467 --> 01:49:04,230
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are hit while you're not holding something, you lose life, but your weapons are kind of used as armor.

1382
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:12,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get points orbs to collect, and you'll get different rewards for them.

1383
01:49:14,293 --> 01:49:15,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the game.

1384
01:49:16,434 --> 01:49:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to play it, good luck.

1385
01:49:20,794 --> 01:49:23,696
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was, I mean, after K.O.U.

1386
01:49:23,716 --> 01:49:30,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Gekitai was very well received, the developers at Victor Entertainment wanted to make a sequel.

1387
01:49:31,541 --> 01:49:35,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were trying to get ideas together.

1388
01:49:36,184 --> 01:49:39,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the thing, they were looking at the three sequels.

1389
01:49:40,626 --> 01:49:51,152
[SPEAKER_03]: making a 3D video game, but they chose to stick to 2D because the game was started development for Sega CD, which Keio Gekitai was on.

1390
01:49:53,733 --> 01:50:03,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But once the Saturn release was rumored amongst the developers, they changed and really tried to

1391
01:50:05,214 --> 01:50:15,741
[SPEAKER_03]: pushed the 2D capabilities so they stuck with 2D and they were going to make it a graphically enhanced version of K.O.U.

1392
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Gekitai but then it was made into its own game with a different story they wanted it to be a little bit different so they wanted to bring out more of the charm of the characters and so that's why they did it this way

1393
01:50:30,311 --> 01:50:38,635
[SPEAKER_03]: There also... There was a... One of the shooter stages was going to be a platformer stage.

1394
01:50:38,695 --> 01:50:40,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Sumida River.

1395
01:50:41,096 --> 01:50:41,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1396
01:50:42,722 --> 01:51:04,199
[SPEAKER_03]: and so there are bow and arrow sets in there that you can't obtain and so there's like there's just like little pieces left in the game like in the code or you can see them on screen from their original what's the word I'm thinking of the original concepts so

1397
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:17,138
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, like, even going to be the martial arts tournament was planned to have seven participants in it, but they ended up scrapping five of them and only left in two.

1398
01:51:17,258 --> 01:51:19,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, like, all kinds of stuff.

1399
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:24,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted the soundtrack to have a relaxed tone, just kind of easygoing.

1400
01:51:26,505 --> 01:51:27,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah.

1401
01:51:28,387 --> 01:51:28,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It was...

1402
01:51:30,288 --> 01:51:33,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It was released May 17th, 1996 for the Saturn.

1403
01:51:34,132 --> 01:51:37,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in Europe and Australia, it was September later on.

1404
01:51:37,975 --> 01:51:42,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be out March that year and had been considered for a North American release.

1405
01:51:45,763 --> 01:51:53,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was this release that came out in Japan as a Sega Saturn disc called Keio Yu Gekitai Okeraku...

1406
01:51:56,041 --> 01:51:58,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I have my screen set for really small.

1407
01:51:58,563 --> 01:52:04,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Tama Tobacco, which was the KO Flying Squadron carefree jewel box that was not for resale.

1408
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:11,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had really high quality versions of the opening and ending FMV cutscenes of the games, which are

1409
01:52:13,031 --> 01:52:39,183
[SPEAKER_03]: fully animated scenes and then there were some other scenes that were related to the second game and demo levels from the second game and a sound test with voice clips and everything and there's all kinds of neat stuff on there it was pretty cool it got mixed reception everyone thought that the game looked really great and they loved the soundtrack but they thought that the controls were not as great

1410
01:52:40,283 --> 01:53:04,411
[SPEAKER_03]: um and of course there was uh the whole rivalry rivalry with Nintendo and PlayStation at the time that was taking away some of the market share for platformers um but there were folks who just said it seemed generic and way too easy but it was still pretty fun because it was odd and there you go all right

1411
01:53:05,728 --> 01:53:08,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not a game I knew a lot about, to be honest.

1412
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're a fan of this series, but you know I missed most of the Saturn games, and so I'm kind of learning about them years later, to be quite honest, through segments such as this one.

1413
01:53:15,975 --> 01:53:20,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is one a lot of people just really aren't super aware of, I mean.

1414
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:28,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is another one of those games that follows, like Terranigma did, where it came out.

1415
01:53:29,179 --> 01:53:31,820
[SPEAKER_03]: in Japan and Europe, but never in North America.

1416
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:32,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Australia as well.

1417
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,701
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know that Terranigma came out in Australia.

1418
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:35,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to look it up.

1419
01:53:35,781 --> 01:53:40,103
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it looks like it just has some neat things for its time in platforming.

1420
01:53:40,143 --> 01:53:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, definitely like that sense of humor as well that, you know, maybe you would see in like, I don't know, Goemon, but not a lot, a lot outside of that.

1421
01:53:48,725 --> 01:53:49,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

1422
01:53:49,326 --> 01:53:50,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still different.

1423
01:53:50,386 --> 01:53:52,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the pace is a little bit slow on it to me.

1424
01:53:52,627 --> 01:53:52,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1425
01:53:53,487 --> 01:53:53,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1426
01:53:54,247 --> 01:53:54,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But neat.

1427
01:53:54,928 --> 01:53:55,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.

1428
01:53:56,228 --> 01:53:56,348
Yeah.

1429
01:53:57,222 --> 01:54:16,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I love all the imagery in it and I love the graphics so it's really pretty great choice for a classic game awesome awesome alright we're gonna get back into some more news here in fact we're gonna get into some rapid fire news here on the program let's get to it Loki what do you have for us quickly

1430
01:54:17,521 --> 01:54:18,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm so excited.

1431
01:54:18,682 --> 01:54:21,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They've announced the sequel to PowerWash Sim.

1432
01:54:21,624 --> 01:54:23,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's PowerWash Simulator 2.

1433
01:54:23,165 --> 01:54:26,788
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be coming out later this year, console and PC.

1434
01:54:27,708 --> 01:54:28,889
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs a tagline.

1435
01:54:29,169 --> 01:54:32,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs that wash harder or something.

1436
01:54:33,813 --> 01:54:35,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Electric Boogaloo or something like that.

1437
01:54:35,954 --> 01:54:36,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1438
01:54:36,755 --> 01:54:37,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs a title.

1439
01:54:38,755 --> 01:54:43,578
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they're going to have two players split screen in there as well.

1440
01:54:45,259 --> 01:54:47,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, it looks pretty similar.

1441
01:54:48,181 --> 01:54:54,625
[SPEAKER_07]: There's supposed to be a hub that you can set up and customize.

1442
01:54:56,747 --> 01:54:59,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe like your own company office or something like that.

1443
01:54:59,649 --> 01:55:00,249
[SPEAKER_07]: You can do that.

1444
01:55:02,731 --> 01:55:04,732
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1445
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I love PowerWash Simulator.

1446
01:55:06,293 --> 01:55:06,633
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a...

1447
01:55:09,323 --> 01:55:32,188
[SPEAKER_07]: just one of those simple fun games that you just I know exactly what you mean it's a great game to just get high to and play I mean to just zone out and play yeah so I highly recommend it and I'm definitely looking forward to checking it out when it comes out later this year and then along with that um

1448
01:55:33,817 --> 01:55:44,741
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a brand new LEGO Mario set, and it is a LEGO Mario Kart set that features Mario in his iconic go-kart for $170.

1449
01:55:45,021 --> 01:55:55,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out in May, I think May 1st, and that was announced on Mario Day, and of course...

1450
01:55:57,501 --> 01:56:24,805
[SPEAKER_07]: it looks amazing like it's a really well put together set so I I don't want it it's eight and a half inches tall and like twelve and a half inches wide so it's not a small thing alright I'm excited for more Lego sets I'm not excited to spend the money on it but you know that's how those things go sometimes so alright DarkSakura what do you got for us?

1451
01:56:26,497 --> 01:56:28,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have some fun stuff.

1452
01:56:29,139 --> 01:56:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of my favorite games ever, Chrono Trigger, is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and there are lots of projects going on.

1453
01:56:40,649 --> 01:56:49,596
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a celebration post on their Twitter, I love that the site's still calling it Twitter, that Squenic says we can look forward to various developments that go beyond the world of the game.

1454
01:56:50,497 --> 01:56:52,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, I will...

1455
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:58,701
[SPEAKER_03]: a quote to mark the 30th anniversary and to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far.

1456
01:56:59,081 --> 01:57:02,923
[SPEAKER_03]: We are planning a variety of projects over the next year that will go beyond the world of the game.

1457
01:57:03,003 --> 01:57:04,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Please look forward to the latest information.

1458
01:57:05,604 --> 01:57:08,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is a, well, it's already happened.

1459
01:57:08,665 --> 01:57:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a live stream of music from Chrono Trigger from the soundtrack on March 14th.

1460
01:57:14,467 --> 01:57:15,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was another one.

1461
01:57:16,088 --> 01:57:18,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's still, it went until March 15th.

1462
01:57:20,349 --> 01:57:21,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But the whole thing is up on YouTube.

1463
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I can copy the link for chat.

1464
01:57:25,312 --> 01:57:30,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's... I have very special memories attached to this game.

1465
01:57:33,617 --> 01:57:34,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1466
01:57:34,317 --> 01:57:37,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe for its birthday, I'll play it again.

1467
01:57:38,139 --> 01:57:38,920
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that?

1468
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:39,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1469
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:40,881
[SPEAKER_03]: No promises.

1470
01:57:40,901 --> 01:57:44,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten practically all the endings, so... But I told you what...

1471
01:57:46,178 --> 01:57:48,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very, very treasured memory.

1472
01:57:50,381 --> 01:58:09,511
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the last Facebook messages, when I was still on Facebook, that I got from my papa-san, who passed away a couple years ago, was a message out of the blue that says, I remember how I loved sitting and watching you play Chrono Trigger.

1473
01:58:13,293 --> 01:58:14,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've kept that message forever.

1474
01:58:15,562 --> 01:58:16,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love that.

1475
01:58:17,664 --> 01:58:17,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1476
01:58:18,905 --> 01:58:19,225
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1477
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no easy way to follow that up, but I will talk about a game that I definitely am always willing to replay, and that's Katamari Damacy.

1478
01:58:29,374 --> 01:58:29,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1479
01:58:29,794 --> 01:58:32,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's been a long time since we've had a new Katamari game.

1480
01:58:32,997 --> 01:58:41,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It hasn't been that long since we've had a Katamari remaster, because we had one of those in 2023, but it's been a while since we've had a full-on new Katamari game.

1481
01:58:42,045 --> 01:58:42,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Catamari Damashii Rolling Live

1482
01:58:57,621 --> 01:59:03,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my own criticisms about playing games on touchscreens and things like that when a game is not specifically designed for that.

1483
01:59:03,967 --> 01:59:08,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see Katamari as a game that actually makes a lot of sense for a phone.

1484
01:59:08,751 --> 01:59:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So this could actually be pretty cool.

1485
01:59:10,433 --> 01:59:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious to check this out.

1486
01:59:12,955 --> 01:59:17,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not going to be something extremely different from other Katamari games.

1487
01:59:18,362 --> 01:59:19,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You play as the prince.

1488
01:59:19,683 --> 01:59:20,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You roll up objects.

1489
01:59:20,884 --> 01:59:21,505
[SPEAKER_04]: They get big.

1490
01:59:21,605 --> 01:59:22,526
[SPEAKER_04]: They become stars.

1491
01:59:22,986 --> 01:59:26,910
[SPEAKER_04]: But this time, and I love this, it's Kaidabai Damasi rolling live.

1492
01:59:27,310 --> 01:59:30,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You are now the prince as a live streamer.

1493
01:59:32,421 --> 01:59:32,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of love it.

1494
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:58,081
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1495
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: could stand to be the best fucking part of this game right there.

1496
02:00:16,312 --> 02:00:19,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the soundtrack, so there's a lot of good stuff in there.

1497
02:00:19,234 --> 02:00:21,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, yeah, this is cool.

1498
02:00:21,416 --> 02:00:22,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't let me down.

1499
02:00:22,256 --> 02:00:23,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't let me down.

1500
02:00:23,037 --> 02:00:25,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so disappointed that it's only on one platform, though.

1501
02:00:26,099 --> 02:00:27,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't like that.

1502
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:32,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of what game it is, especially like a Katamari or something like that, like, I hate when they just...

1503
02:00:33,584 --> 02:00:35,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Put out a game on one platform.

1504
02:00:35,826 --> 02:00:41,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, maybe it'll go the way of Fantasian and in two years, you know, and to be fair, any game.

1505
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:44,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I say Fantasian because that was Apple Arcade specifically, but you could put any, insert any game here.

1506
02:00:44,873 --> 02:00:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Final Fantasy 16?

1507
02:00:46,314 --> 02:00:49,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it goes, or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now is going to be on the platform.

1508
02:00:49,857 --> 02:00:50,878
[SPEAKER_04]: They all do eventually.

1509
02:00:51,078 --> 02:00:52,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well is a deep word.

1510
02:00:53,135 --> 02:01:02,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody here has an active Apple Arcade account and could very well be more than happy to demo the game for people.

1511
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:02,582
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1512
02:01:03,943 --> 02:01:05,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Streamception.

1513
02:01:05,384 --> 02:01:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You're streaming a game about streaming.

1514
02:01:08,546 --> 02:01:08,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Gasp.

1515
02:01:09,287 --> 02:01:09,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

1516
02:01:10,287 --> 02:01:10,968
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it mean?

1517
02:01:11,929 --> 02:01:27,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Another quick footnote on Apple Arcade because this was announced alongside another announcement about Skate City New York getting an upgrade with 30 new levels and 90 new objectives also coming March 27th and a new Space Invaders game coming on April 3rd.

1518
02:01:27,985 --> 02:01:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put those next to Katamari Damacy, it's harder to care because Katamari Damacy is everything.

1519
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:33,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1520
02:01:33,631 --> 02:01:33,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1521
02:01:34,111 --> 02:01:34,911
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1522
02:01:35,052 --> 02:01:37,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I gave them the footnote they deserved.

1523
02:01:37,573 --> 02:01:38,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to move on.

1524
02:01:38,393 --> 02:01:39,273
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

1525
02:01:39,894 --> 02:01:45,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some big games coming out soon, starting with the U.S.

1526
02:01:45,857 --> 02:01:46,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1527
02:01:47,577 --> 02:01:54,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We have MLB The Show 25 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

1528
02:01:55,692 --> 02:02:14,771
[SPEAKER_07]: My Sims Cozy Bundle on PC Kiniku Neko Super Muscle Cat This game looks amazing Super Muscle Cat It's on PC right now It's now coming out on console Check it out It's what President Cat did in retirement

1529
02:02:17,092 --> 02:02:25,575
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a giant muscly man, but you take the muscly man head off and you put a cute little blue cat head on it.

1530
02:02:25,915 --> 02:02:26,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1565
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:56,553
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the Switch, but what do you have on the PlayStation 5 this week in Japan?

02:05:57,273 --> 02:05:58,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Assassin's Creed Shadows.

1568
02:05:59,295 --> 02:06:02,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought Ubisoft's AAA games were a symptom of the US?

1569
02:06:03,058 --> 02:06:04,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, it's a worldwide problem.

1570
02:06:04,659 --> 02:06:06,140
[SPEAKER_04]: So that game's coming out in Japan as well.

1571
02:06:06,461 --> 02:06:08,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Assassin's Creed mainline games tend to be pretty good.

1572
02:06:08,642 --> 02:06:11,464
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just... Y'all know, Ubisoft just...

1573
02:06:12,265 --> 02:06:13,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Irritating the shit out of us.

1574
02:06:14,588 --> 02:06:18,333
[SPEAKER_04]: But Atlier, of course, is also releasing on the PlayStation 5, so please look forward to that.

02:06:18,474 --> 02:06:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bleach, Rebirth of Souls, also on the PlayStation 5 this week.

1576
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Japan.

1577
02:06:24,061 --> 02:06:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1578
02:06:28,152 --> 02:06:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we have just a handful of things.

[SPEAKER_03]: We have Party Club for PC on the 17th.

[SPEAKER_03]: On the 18th, we have 33 Immortals Early Access PC Xboxes.

1581
02:06:42,723 --> 02:06:46,125
[SPEAKER_03]: My Sims Cozy Bundle for PC, Rainbreaker.

1582
02:06:47,086 --> 02:06:52,109
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 20th, we have Assassin's Creed Shadows PC, Mac, PS5, Xbox, and Switches.

1583
02:06:53,551 --> 02:07:05,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the 20, DigVR, PC, PSVR 2, Vagrant for PC, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Complete Edition, Xbox and PlayStation, Wreckfest 2 for PC.

1584
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:08,823
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 21st, we have Broken Lore Don't Watch for PC.

1585
02:07:10,044 --> 02:07:18,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Assault Suit Lanos 2 Saturn Tribute for Switch and PlayStation, Xenoblade Chronicles X Remastered for Switch.

1586
02:07:19,227 --> 02:07:25,870
[SPEAKER_03]: For on the 21st, we have Atelier Yumiya, The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land for Switch.

1587
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:31,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And also on the 21st, Bleach, Rebirth of Souls, PlayStation, Xboxes, PC.

1588
02:07:34,441 --> 02:07:40,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, with that being our release dates, let's do, I think we have one more story for y'all tonight.

1589
02:07:40,787 --> 02:07:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to Loki.

1590
02:07:43,271 --> 02:07:50,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, apparently Split Fiction is exceeding their expectations as far as what it's selling.

1591
02:07:50,237 --> 02:08:05,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's sold over 2 million copies so far, and is one of the top-selling, or is the top-selling game, at least currently right now, was on Steam, at least on March 7th.

1592
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:06,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it hit the top one.

1593
02:08:08,012 --> 02:08:08,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1594
02:08:08,985 --> 02:08:38,492
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's probably because it's not a $70 game and it doesn't have any microtransactions so they've said they're not gonna have microtransactions plus being that it is a co-op game like it takes two you can also play with your friends um while only one copy if you use the friend pass thing so oh shit that's pretty you can do the the co-op stuff so um i know it takes two was a great game won a bunch of awards and stuff so that was good i played it gonna go along the same lines yeah

1595
02:08:39,554 --> 02:08:41,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so not surprising.

1596
02:08:41,935 --> 02:08:49,778
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, once again, proving that it doesn't take large budgets to make a solid game that sells well.

1597
02:08:50,018 --> 02:08:59,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes just make a good game is more important than make a game with flashy graphics and all these other buzzwords and stuff.

1598
02:08:59,622 --> 02:09:02,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, let's look at what Assassin's Creed is going to do.

1599
02:09:03,083 --> 02:09:05,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, it's probably going to sell okay, but...

1600
02:09:07,133 --> 02:09:32,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those games are kind of just trending downwards they're not getting better they're just kind of and make a complete experience that's very rewarding for 70 bucks Baldur's Gate 3 says hello like yeah I mean do you know I'm hearing uh this is EA's first game not that critics matter but we do talk about it sometimes EA's first game to Metacritic above 90 in like a decade

1601
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:35,061
[SPEAKER_04]: A very long time.

1602
02:09:35,081 --> 02:09:37,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I might be overstating, but it's many years.

1603
02:09:38,463 --> 02:09:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an indie game, and EA games, especially if you're talking about Madden and stuff, a lot of that stuff is just recycled year after year.

1604
02:09:46,589 --> 02:09:48,750
[SPEAKER_04]: EA's still publishing it, for what it's worth.

1605
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:50,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still an EA game.

1606
02:09:50,832 --> 02:09:55,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this is the type of thing that EA, you'll learn from this, EA.

1607
02:09:55,755 --> 02:09:57,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the success here, and look.

1608
02:09:59,878 --> 02:10:00,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make a good game.

1609
02:10:01,379 --> 02:10:02,140
[SPEAKER_04]: A complete game.

1610
02:10:02,780 --> 02:10:03,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Out the box.

1611
02:10:04,853 --> 02:10:09,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we wouldn't have a complete show if we didn't invite the listeners to participate.

1612
02:10:09,777 --> 02:10:17,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We love all you guys that show up here week after week to listen to our show and participate with us, whether you're here live with us on Sunday night or you participate on the podcast feed.

1613
02:10:17,343 --> 02:10:19,745
[SPEAKER_04]: We do invite your emails so you can participate with us every week.

1614
02:10:19,805 --> 02:10:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we will read your emails.

1615
02:10:23,909 --> 02:10:26,231
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, I think we have at least one tonight, right?

1616
02:10:26,351 --> 02:10:26,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one.

1617
02:10:27,152 --> 02:10:27,532
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1618
02:10:27,932 --> 02:10:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into it.

1619
02:10:28,993 --> 02:10:30,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I know who this is from based on Blue Sky.

1620
02:10:30,554 --> 02:10:33,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Hiya, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Mike Deft.

1621
02:10:34,117 --> 02:11:02,543
[SPEAKER_03]: as you may have talked about earlier in the show Niantic sold most of their games divisions to Scopely one of the biggest mobile gaming companies out there I personally am not thrilled about this purchase at all some people have said this is good that finally Niantic doesn't have a say in how the games are run and that finally someone that seems competent enough and knows how to develop actual games will fix all the problems and bugs in them I want to believe them and that's probably the case but who knows exactly because there's something that's certain and that is

1622
02:11:03,363 --> 02:11:04,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Scopely wants money.

1623
02:11:05,325 --> 02:11:10,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Scopely just didn't dish out over $3 billion just because they have cash burning on their bank account.

1624
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:17,679
[SPEAKER_03]: They obviously want the success Niantic has or had in raking in the money from all of these games, especially Pokemon Go.

1625
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:19,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Scopely is known for something...

1626
02:11:20,982 --> 02:11:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: is how they handle monetization in their games.

1627
02:11:23,003 --> 02:11:25,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what worries me the most of this whole deal.

1628
02:11:26,065 --> 02:11:35,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can be very optimistic about this and say that the game won't change that much, if at all, because, and thank you, whoever deity for this, the whole team from Niantic is going to still be working on the games.

1629
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:52,776
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll just have to answer to Scopely now maybe they'll add something like hey if you want to spend this Pokestop again sooner spend coins or like they already do with Dynamax and Gigantamax raids pay to add more bonus reward items I seriously hope

1630
02:11:53,916 --> 02:11:59,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously hope that is the future of the game with Scopely and I'll totally be fine with it.

1631
02:11:59,941 --> 02:12:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll for sure get rid of remote raid limits and possibly add most stuff to help with the game but for a price.

1632
02:12:06,827 --> 02:12:11,150
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see changes for sure but I don't think it will be entirely for the best.

1633
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:15,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, Scopely wants all the money and if you think Niantic was greedy, we haven't seen the worst yet.

1634
02:12:15,774 --> 02:12:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst case scenario is that we're going to have to pay for literally everything.

1635
02:12:19,556 --> 02:12:21,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you hit your spin limit for the day, you gotta pay up.

1636
02:12:22,197 --> 02:12:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, hey, wanna participate in this event at all?

1637
02:12:25,439 --> 02:12:25,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay up.

1638
02:12:26,519 --> 02:12:30,401
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not gonna be great and we're all gonna suffer for it and make the game not enjoyable at all.

1639
02:12:30,461 --> 02:12:32,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what worries me the most about this game.

1640
02:12:32,462 --> 02:12:33,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It finally dies.

1641
02:12:33,822 --> 02:12:36,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Pogo since day one or zero even.

1642
02:12:36,804 --> 02:12:38,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I installed the APK from the New Zealand release.

1643
02:12:39,565 --> 02:12:46,751
[SPEAKER_03]: and while not a perfect run, I enjoyed the ride so far and that's because the people I've met, the experiences I've had and all I've done in these almost eight years.

1644
02:12:48,219 --> 02:12:54,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Those ain't gonna go away and I'll cherish them but I can't help but feel it all going down the drain because of corporate greed.

1645
02:12:55,062 --> 02:13:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still playing Pokemon Go daily and will continue to do so until it's not fun or enjoyable at all.

1646
02:13:00,663 --> 02:13:07,826
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, my love for Pokemon is greater than my love for Go and nobody will probably ever take that.

1647
02:13:08,646 --> 02:13:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously, seriously hope I'm wrong about this and I'm just worrying too much about

1648
02:13:14,108 --> 02:13:16,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm worrying too much and everything will be fine and dandy.

1649
02:13:16,412 --> 02:13:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one knows.

1650
02:13:17,314 --> 02:13:20,019
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just have to wait and see and hope for the best.

1651
02:13:20,379 --> 02:13:24,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just end this email with the old saying, better the devil you know than the devil you don't.

1652
02:13:24,446 --> 02:13:26,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for reading and wish you all the best.

1653
02:13:28,288 --> 02:13:29,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the email, Deft.

1654
02:13:29,729 --> 02:13:36,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I have anything really to add to it since we, you know, spent, I spent a good 30 minutes at the top of the show talking about it, so I don't want to totally repeat everything.

1655
02:13:36,695 --> 02:13:38,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the additional perspective.

1656
02:13:38,677 --> 02:13:53,209
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing you do bring up that's interesting that I didn't think about that could absolutely, because I've actually mentioned it before on the program, is that, you know, an item in Ingress exists, or a pair of items I'm thinking of exist in Ingress called a multi-hack and a heat sink.

1657
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:56,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Ingress, you can only hack a portal for

1658
02:13:56,212 --> 02:13:57,593
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1659
02:14:19,305 --> 02:14:26,631
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I bring all that up, not that it's a one-to-one equivalent, because again, and as I said earlier, you have a PvE game and a PvP game.

1660
02:14:26,671 --> 02:14:27,852
[SPEAKER_04]: These are very different sorts of things.

1661
02:14:28,132 --> 02:14:30,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, you don't pay for these items.

1662
02:14:30,614 --> 02:14:33,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Heatsinks and Multisinks are not paid items in Ingress.

1663
02:14:33,477 --> 02:14:35,358
[SPEAKER_04]: You hack them from other portals.

1664
02:14:35,719 --> 02:14:39,282
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like items, you know, like cards in your deck that you can play, if you will.

1665
02:14:40,423 --> 02:14:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually think that's a...

1666
02:14:43,505 --> 02:14:48,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that monetization isn't already in Pokemon Go, to be quite honest, Deft.

1667
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:58,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to cool down the time that you can spin the Pokestop, or that there was never a hard limit on how many times you could spin a Pokestop.

1668
02:14:58,737 --> 02:14:59,318
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

1669
02:15:25,627 --> 02:15:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a thing here that could really piss the fanbase off.

1670
02:15:30,230 --> 02:15:37,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that that could be the unpopular change Scopely makes, is they put a hard limit on how many times you could spin that stop.

1671
02:15:37,854 --> 02:15:44,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Deft is actually saying, technically there is a limit, but you don't really hit it unless you're completely hardcore.

1672
02:15:44,218 --> 02:15:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I never realized you could hit a limit, but I guess that makes sense.

1673
02:15:46,999 --> 02:15:47,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1674
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:52,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and PogCulture says, or on their couch when the pokey stop is right outside their apartment.

1675
02:15:52,802 --> 02:15:54,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, the little free libraries we were talking about earlier.

1676
02:15:55,663 --> 02:15:59,124
[SPEAKER_04]: SG100Matt says, surely they'll monetize the gifts.

1677
02:15:59,664 --> 02:16:01,545
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why I liked the gifts?

1678
02:16:03,254 --> 02:16:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That felt like Niantic's original mission to me, to be able to explore the world.

1679
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Routes are actually supremely underrated in Pokemon Go because the point isn't that great in Pokemon Go.

1680
02:16:17,864 --> 02:16:21,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're underrated, meaning even by Niantic, they're underdone.

1681
02:16:22,167 --> 02:16:26,270
[SPEAKER_04]: The equivalent in Ingress is a huge reason to play the game.

1682
02:16:26,651 --> 02:16:29,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Missions is a huge thing that keeps people going in that game.

1683
02:16:30,293 --> 02:16:31,574
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1684
02:17:00,174 --> 02:17:21,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Niantic, let's be real Niantic had a little bit of a flash in the pan in some ways they are not good at making games to make money sure they had Pokemon but a lot of their other attempts have not done well I like Pikmin but a lot of you just shit on it and I

1685
02:17:22,828 --> 02:17:28,069
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean you specifically in chat, just like a lot of people out there that I talk to, just like, I don't like Pikmin.

1686
02:17:28,489 --> 02:17:29,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever played it?

1687
02:17:30,189 --> 02:17:31,129
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I don't like Pikmin.

1688
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's nothing like a game on GameCube through the Switch.

1689
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care, I don't like it.

1690
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:36,930
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just don't like it.

1691
02:17:37,831 --> 02:17:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1692
02:17:38,711 --> 02:17:39,351
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like it.

1693
02:17:39,431 --> 02:17:39,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you.

1694
02:17:40,391 --> 02:17:46,732
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just... I'm worried that Pikmin's going to be the first one to go, but I hope not.

1695
02:17:46,812 --> 02:17:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I really hope not.

1696
02:17:47,472 --> 02:17:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the fact that it's got the Nintendo tie-in.

1697
02:17:49,413 --> 02:17:51,213
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, Nintendo is...

1698
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:53,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And neither do I, Bobby.

1699
02:17:53,662 --> 02:17:55,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the console games either.

1700
02:17:55,463 --> 02:17:57,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But the mobile phone, again, I swear by it.

1701
02:17:57,745 --> 02:18:02,189
[SPEAKER_04]: For walking incentivization, it is the best Niantic game.

1702
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:11,676
[SPEAKER_04]: For that concept of explore the world around you and do shit with your friends in the process, Pikmin is one of the best games on that.

1703
02:18:11,996 --> 02:18:13,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody fucking believes me.

1704
02:18:13,818 --> 02:18:15,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for you and your wife, Bobby.

1705
02:18:16,460 --> 02:18:17,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few other people out there that play.

1706
02:18:18,861 --> 02:18:19,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1707
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:22,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, thank you for the email.

1708
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:23,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I do appreciate the perspective.

1709
02:18:24,253 --> 02:18:25,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, top of the show.

1710
02:18:25,695 --> 02:18:26,095
[SPEAKER_04]: We had more.

1711
02:18:26,876 --> 02:18:30,941
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, that means we are open to phone calls and so forth.

1712
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:34,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to take Ranma's call tonight, but I noticed he's not here.

1713
02:18:34,545 --> 02:18:36,728
[SPEAKER_04]: But was DerpyCon this weekend?

1714
02:18:36,748 --> 02:18:38,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think he was posting pictures from that.

1715
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:40,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So he might be out at a convention right now.

1716
02:18:40,772 --> 02:18:43,073
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to call, you can always join our green room.

1717
02:18:43,414 --> 02:18:45,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage you to join our Discord so you can talk to us throughout the week.

1718
02:18:46,036 --> 02:18:47,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1719
02:18:48,277 --> 02:18:56,664
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you like to share stories in our channel, and we will post those throughout the week and read some of those on the show.

1720
02:18:57,905 --> 02:18:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: We minimize the ping.

1721
02:19:00,446 --> 02:19:04,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't think we've pinged everybody on the server in years.

1722
02:19:05,430 --> 02:19:05,890
[SPEAKER_04]: or Ever.

1723
02:19:06,271 --> 02:19:11,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't use that feature, which I know a lot of people can't stand when they join 100 Discord servers is that they're all pinging them.

1724
02:19:12,594 --> 02:19:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that.

1725
02:19:13,235 --> 02:19:14,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

1726
02:19:14,155 --> 02:19:16,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Def says though, as long as you're not an ass or a bot.

1727
02:19:16,997 --> 02:19:17,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1728
02:19:17,778 --> 02:19:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an ass or a bot, please then do not join.

1729
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:21,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not come.

1730
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:24,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're an ass bot, what the fuck are you?

1731
02:19:24,301 --> 02:19:27,443
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're an ass bot, come on in because I want to see what that's all about.

1732
02:19:30,385 --> 02:19:32,386
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the butt bot in Twitch, right?

1733
02:19:32,426 --> 02:19:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1734
02:19:37,332 --> 02:19:39,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, funny, funny bread.

1735
02:19:39,253 --> 02:19:40,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, ass butt.

1736
02:19:40,233 --> 02:19:40,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1737
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:42,394
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to ass butt.

1738
02:19:43,874 --> 02:19:45,295
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some last minute stories?

1739
02:19:45,355 --> 02:19:46,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, we have any of those?

1740
02:19:47,315 --> 02:19:48,376
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was looking.

1741
02:19:48,436 --> 02:19:48,776
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1742
02:19:49,396 --> 02:19:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

1743
02:19:50,056 --> 02:19:50,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1744
02:19:50,516 --> 02:19:50,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1745
02:19:50,996 --> 02:19:51,276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

1746
02:19:51,296 --> 02:19:53,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a pretty busy week, all things considered.

1747
02:19:53,177 --> 02:19:55,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think with that, we can wrap up.

1748
02:19:55,138 --> 02:19:56,838
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is going to do some streaming.

1749
02:19:57,118 --> 02:19:58,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing Debbie tonight again?

1750
02:19:58,819 --> 02:19:59,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you doing?

1751
02:19:59,519 --> 02:20:00,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll play Debbie.

1752
02:20:00,419 --> 02:20:00,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1753
02:20:00,799 --> 02:20:01,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1754
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:02,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did.

1755
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:03,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the new killer.

1756
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to ask.

1757
02:20:05,241 --> 02:20:05,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Tokyo Ghoul.

1758
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:06,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1759
02:20:06,281 --> 02:20:06,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1760
02:20:18,357 --> 02:20:42,735
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched any Tokyo Ghoul but I know a lot of people who are really into it and the character design is very nice the concept of how they move is like this cross between I want to say like Legion and Wesker it's interesting it's really interesting so I'm looking forward to giving it a shot so we'll see

1761
02:20:43,303 --> 02:21:08,247
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a little Spider-Man to me because like you attach to walls and like pull yourself to the wall like it I don't know that's kind of the sense I got from it a little bit a little bit no weird I mean I could kind of see it but but at any rate though um we only get the killer we're not getting survivor or a special stage or or anything to that extent it's just gonna be the killer

1762
02:21:09,741 --> 02:21:14,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And funny people are saying that his best perks is a yellow one and a brown one.

1763
02:21:15,104 --> 02:21:24,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, look, for the Dead by Daylight fans out there, I'm just happy you finally got your tentacle monster killer and he's sexy.

1764
02:21:25,351 --> 02:21:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, look, they're actually delivering on bringing the sexy tentacle monster into Dead by Daylight.

1765
02:21:29,694 --> 02:21:30,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1766
02:21:30,735 --> 02:21:31,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You won.

1767
02:21:31,455 --> 02:21:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: You all beat the game.

1768
02:21:32,516 --> 02:21:35,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fanfic worked.

1769
02:21:35,258 --> 02:21:35,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats.

1770
02:21:37,099 --> 02:21:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, but there was a thing that they were doing, an event called Tadayama, which means I'm home in Japan last week.

1771
02:21:47,671 --> 02:21:50,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was them announcing the Tokyo Ghoul thing.

1772
02:21:50,395 --> 02:21:53,038
[SPEAKER_03]: DBD is massive in Japan, like super big.

1773
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:54,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

1774
02:21:56,408 --> 02:21:57,449
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of talk and chat.

1775
02:21:57,469 --> 02:22:03,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we wrap up, there's a lot of talk and chat about Looney Tunes because I guess it's going around on socials, on Blue Sky and stuff.

1776
02:22:04,154 --> 02:22:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: SGO100Matt says, I just read that they Zazloved all the classic Looney Tunes off of Max.

1777
02:22:10,839 --> 02:22:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1778
02:22:13,781 --> 02:22:14,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know.

1779
02:22:14,602 --> 02:22:16,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're talking about that there's a new Looney Tunes movie.

1780
02:22:17,284 --> 02:22:21,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know that there was a new Looney Tunes movie.

1781
02:22:22,168 --> 02:22:36,433
[SPEAKER_04]: now I'm kind of curious about it because I see Bobby is saying I kind of wish everyone would go watch the new Looney Tunes movie in the theater this week or at least buy tickets to it if you want to support 2D animation in future films I literally know nothing about it is Bugs Bunny in drag?

1782
02:22:36,513 --> 02:22:46,717
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'll go see it for Drag Bugs Bunny by the way I'm thinking about getting a hat with Drags Bug Bunny on it tell me I shouldn't do it

1783
02:22:47,170 --> 02:22:47,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're right.

1784
02:22:47,690 --> 02:22:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I should.

1785
02:22:48,670 --> 02:22:48,990
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1786
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:52,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Bugs Bunny isn't in it, but Daffy Duck and Porky Pig are.

1787
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:53,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's cool.

1788
02:22:54,552 --> 02:22:56,872
[SPEAKER_04]: We all love Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.

1789
02:22:57,352 --> 02:22:59,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Even cold.

1790
02:22:59,393 --> 02:23:00,933
[SPEAKER_04]: The day the earth blew up.

1791
02:23:03,354 --> 02:23:04,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm down for that.

1792
02:23:04,614 --> 02:23:05,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go see it.

1793
02:23:05,694 --> 02:23:06,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to go see it?

1794
02:23:06,975 --> 02:23:08,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do.

1795
02:23:08,135 --> 02:23:08,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

1796
02:23:09,055 --> 02:23:09,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's fucking do it.

1797
02:23:09,915 --> 02:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go on an OLR date just for Bobby Blackwolf.

1798
02:23:13,296 --> 02:23:13,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

1799
02:23:13,896 --> 02:23:14,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go see it.

1800
02:23:14,857 --> 02:23:16,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have ballet tomorrow.

1801
02:23:17,872 --> 02:23:20,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I have plans tomorrow, but I don't really know.

1802
02:23:20,214 --> 02:23:21,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have plans Wednesday.

1803
02:23:21,615 --> 02:23:22,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can go Wednesday.

1804
02:23:22,696 --> 02:23:23,236
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go Wednesday.

1805
02:23:23,377 --> 02:23:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it.

1806
02:23:24,137 --> 02:23:24,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1807
02:23:25,198 --> 02:23:25,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

1808
02:23:25,598 --> 02:23:26,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Done and done.

1809
02:23:26,039 --> 02:23:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there cheap movie deals on Wednesday?

1810
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:27,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.

1811
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1812
02:23:29,421 --> 02:23:38,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And I literally know nothing about it, but Looney Tunes is just dumb enough, complimentary, that I will probably enjoy it.

1813
02:23:38,808 --> 02:23:39,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to know anymore.

1814
02:23:39,749 --> 02:23:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Looney Tunes cartoons are just dumb.

1815
02:23:41,350 --> 02:23:44,513
[SPEAKER_04]: You put them on in the background, they're always fun and mildly entertaining.

1816
02:23:44,753 --> 02:23:47,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, dumb, parenthesis, complimentary.

1817
02:23:50,243 --> 02:23:57,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I am hosting a screening of the movie Sleepaway Camp on Saturday here in Sacramento, which, by the way, I encourage you all to come see.

1818
02:23:57,690 --> 02:23:59,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, Loki, you've seen this.

1819
02:23:59,812 --> 02:24:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Sleepaway Camp, that movie from the 80s with Angela.

1820
02:24:03,616 --> 02:24:04,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I slipped through it.

1821
02:24:05,298 --> 02:24:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Felisa Rose who played Angela in that movie is going to be here live doing live commentary and I have the great delight of sharing the stage with her that night so we are going to have a lot of fun so Sleepaway Camp going to be at the Colonial on Saturday night very excited about that but that movie is also very very dumb complimentary so alright

1822
02:24:27,644 --> 02:24:32,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwell says it's modeled after a sci-fi B-movie from the 50s.

1823
02:24:32,167 --> 02:24:33,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm even more down for that.

1824
02:24:33,888 --> 02:24:34,528
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be cute.

1825
02:24:34,548 --> 02:24:35,168
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be fun.

1826
02:24:36,569 --> 02:24:39,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if it actually is like Planet 9 from outer space.

1827
02:24:40,031 --> 02:24:43,612
[SPEAKER_03]: This island Earth can be yours if the price is right.

1828
02:24:44,473 --> 02:24:44,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1829
02:24:45,453 --> 02:24:46,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Now SSJ100 Matt's talking.

1830
02:24:46,974 --> 02:24:48,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder if it can be enhanced with edibles.

1831
02:24:49,495 --> 02:24:50,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, go pick us up some chocolate.

1832
02:24:55,066 --> 02:24:58,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I didn't show that on Twitch or anything.

1833
02:24:59,548 --> 02:24:59,828
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1834
02:25:00,368 --> 02:25:00,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1835
02:25:00,828 --> 02:25:00,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1836
02:25:01,869 --> 02:25:03,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, bring me something then.

1837
02:25:03,129 --> 02:25:03,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a dollar.

1838
02:25:04,850 --> 02:25:07,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Only something that is completely legal in California.

1839
02:25:07,391 --> 02:25:08,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just candy.

1840
02:25:08,251 --> 02:25:08,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just candy.

1841
02:25:08,891 --> 02:25:10,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's candy I bought at the store.

1842
02:25:10,392 --> 02:25:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

1843
02:25:11,832 --> 02:25:12,192
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1844
02:25:12,252 --> 02:25:13,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate candy.

1845
02:25:15,033 --> 02:25:15,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1846
02:25:16,014 --> 02:25:16,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1847
02:25:18,018 --> 02:25:19,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get those final thoughts.

1848
02:25:19,679 --> 02:25:20,800
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, over to you.

1849
02:25:20,820 --> 02:25:20,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1850
02:25:47,465 --> 02:25:49,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of looking forward to playing.

1851
02:25:49,927 --> 02:25:50,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I might just do Killer.

1852
02:25:51,108 --> 02:25:51,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1853
02:25:52,209 --> 02:25:54,711
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have things to talk about.

1854
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:57,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So come and listen to me talk.

1855
02:25:57,593 --> 02:25:58,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good stream.

1856
02:25:58,694 --> 02:25:59,215
[SPEAKER_03]: About things.

1857
02:25:59,695 --> 02:26:00,596
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll see you in just a moment.

1858
02:26:00,656 --> 02:26:02,157
[SPEAKER_03]: There's good things in my future and it makes me happy.

1859
02:26:02,297 --> 02:26:03,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll see you later.

1860
02:26:03,478 --> 02:26:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, happy.

1861
02:26:03,978 --> 02:26:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll see you in a minute.

1862
02:26:07,181 --> 02:26:07,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1863
02:26:09,242 --> 02:26:13,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully I'll have another episode out of my Minecraft series this week.

1864
02:26:13,766 --> 02:26:14,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1865
02:26:14,206 --> 02:26:14,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to get it weekly.

1866
02:26:15,287 --> 02:26:15,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to it.

1867
02:26:17,366 --> 02:26:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, sorry the last couple podcasts have gone up a couple days later on the feed.

1868
02:26:23,150 --> 02:26:24,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't do that tonight.

1869
02:26:24,571 --> 02:26:27,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I've just had some other things going on on Sunday night the last couple weeks.

1870
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:32,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But tonight, I'm home alone, I think, because I think Alan went to the store.

1871
02:26:32,536 --> 02:26:33,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will have the show up shortly.

1872
02:26:34,077 --> 02:26:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry about that.

1873
02:26:35,218 --> 02:26:38,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, thank you as always for your support of the show.

1874
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,421
[SPEAKER_04]: You all are wonderful people.

1875
02:26:39,881 --> 02:26:40,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1876
02:26:40,261 --> 02:26:44,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being good people, because as we saw at one point during tonight's show,

1877
02:26:44,904 --> 02:26:57,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody passes the vibe check around here and I appreciate all of you that show up live that have great vibes and bring great vibes to the show and I appreciate all of you that email us and participate on Discord and all the other ways through the podcast feed.

1878
02:26:57,530 --> 02:26:59,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel those good vibes as well.

1879
02:26:59,431 --> 02:27:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So keep those good vibes rolling.

1880
02:27:01,312 --> 02:27:02,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun gaming this week.

1881
02:27:02,613 --> 02:27:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you are going to be real into Xenoblade Chronicles X. Enjoy it.

1882
02:27:05,794 --> 02:27:06,615
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been waiting for this.

1883
02:27:06,975 --> 02:27:07,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1884
02:27:07,435 --> 02:27:08,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you in seven days.

1885
02:27:08,276 --> 02:27:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1886
02:27:10,597 --> 02:27:12,878
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio

1887
02:27:15,189 --> 02:27:15,850
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week.
