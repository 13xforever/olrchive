9881	14484	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 Plus 2 made me realize that my knowledge of Pro Skater 1 was significantly stronger than Pro Skater 2.
14844	18226	I thought I was adept at all four, but have realized it steadily declined along the first floor.
18346	27472	But I did play them and thoroughly enjoyed Pro Skater 1 Plus 2, so I look forward to playing 3 Plus 4, revisiting what I do remember, and also establishing memory that may have been vague or lost in the 24 and 23 years since.
27692	29293	It's almost time to grind the grind all over again.
29413	34276	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this future release and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34417	36398	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39741	42422	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42442	47364	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47484	53586	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back live tonight after a little pre-planned break.
54046	55467	Tonight, March 9th, 2025, episode number 1037 of our show.
55487	56367	We've been gone for a
66011	66632	DarkSakura.com
86305	91332	I managed to make it through last year without having my really bad bout of laryngitis that I get.
92013	95479	And well, it's kind of wanting to do its thing now.
99224	99865	I can't.
99885	101426	It's super chocolate.
118982	123224	I have been finding all of these weird, wacky, wild flavors of coffee lately.
123585	129808	And I gotta tell you, I never thought I would enjoy banana split flavored coffee, but it's S tier.
129828	130689	That sounds bizarre.
130769	131769	It is so good.
132389	134250	But I really like banana flavor, okay?
134851	138993	You know how like banana Laffy Taffy is like some of the world's most divisive candy?
139013	139934	I can't eat Laffy Taffy.
139974	141675	Okay, what else is banana?
141775	142335	Banana Runts?
142475	149880	I know though that the fake banana flavor is actually based off of a semi-extinct breed of banana.
150080	150500	Yeah, yeah.
150520	154563	That's why it tastes so different than the, I think the modern one is Cavendish.
155063	155323	Okay.
155343	156144	If I remember correctly.
156224	156724	Yeah, yeah.
156784	159366	No, that would make sense because like banana runts don't really taste like banana.
159386	161527	That's one maybe I can think of that's not like chewy.
161567	162728	It's a, yeah.
162748	164769	Banana milk doesn't taste like modern banana.
164969	165209	Yeah.
165730	166530	But yeah.
166590	167511	I love freaking banana milk.
167731	170593	But earlier today, I had mint ice cream coffee, too.
170813	172615	I mean, that was just really- Okay, that sounds really good.
172655	173775	That's just really coffee with mint.
173996	177318	And maybe a little bit of the chocolate flavor they put in it.
177758	179640	But it was good.
180000	181081	I love my coffee.
182041	185924	Looking in chat, Small Shay in chat starts us off tonight saying, Coffee talk?
186004	186344	That's right.
186685	188066	I'm your host, Linda Richman.
189446	191027	Oh, you know Shay likes coffee.
192027	194288	Shay is about the coffee.
194568	196009	Banana split flavor.
196169	197849	Neither banana nor split.
197929	198470	Discuss.
198490	201631	Discuss.
202611	208934	I do have to say, though, that I have gotten, I found Almond Rocha Tarani, sugar-free.
209194	209594	Oh, yeah.
209674	211235	No, I love my sugar-free Tarani.
211655	211855	Oh, yeah.
212515	217097	I am, I go to TJ Maxx just to get Torani and my career coffee.
217177	225359	I was going to say those types of like the big box discount stores, like because TJ Maxx, HomeGoods, there's another one I would put in the same, Marshalls.
226179	227660	Those all are great.
227960	229640	HomeGoods and Marshalls are all the same.
230421	230701	Yeah.
231121	231481	Company.
231501	236383	But they all, I mean, they all carry that like sugar-free Torani or other kinds of syrup.
236663	238143	Like, you know, one time I found the-
241388	248696	I found the Bethany Frankel brand, Skitty Girl or whatever it's called, like Tarani from one of the Real Housewives.
249156	252680	I can't believe it was at the discount mart, but it was.
253441	261970	They have those all the time, but I do get this one Italian brand I don't remember, but I have lavender syrup to put in lemonade.
263160	263700	Wait, where?
263720	263840	Where?
290550	291150	at Starbee's.
292391	293431	They have hazelnut.
293591	294171	Nope, not sure.
294211	294791	They used to.
295071	296952	Years ago, they used to have hazelnut cinnamon dolce.
296972	298432	They had it a couple weeks ago.
298592	299412	Pre-pandemic.
300993	304894	I'll have to bring it up in the app, but I swear I've only been able to find sugar-free vanilla.
305214	315957	But you go to Dutch Brothers, and they use Tarani, because they just use Tarani brand syrup, so they have every sugar-free and sugar-filled, but they have every... They use Tarani and Da Vinci.
316798	320100	I can get sugar-free coconut and I can get it with sugar-free chocolate syrup.
320160	320580	It's great.
321761	322302	I love it.
323082	335550	I'm right now, though, I'm being really wary of the companies I go to because if I find that they've canceled their DEI, then I'm trying to make it a very, very active point not to use their services.
335990	340093	Although the hard thing has been trying to disengage myself from the Googleverse.
340353	340593	Yeah.
340793	346217	Because all of my emails, especially one that I've had for longer than some people in chat have been live.
348350	372140	you know yeah it's it's it's it's hard when it's happening everywhere but I understand the whole like making an informed choice I don't like to what I I don't like what I'm doing to be called boycotting I like it to be called making an informed choice that's kind of where I'm at with it so because like so to be hitting a lot of these companies that they are feeling strained from it now yeah
373069	379575	Well, you know, I think with a lot of other stuff going on where everything's generally more expensive, I think people are just being more choosy on what they're buying.
379655	381076	So, you know, this is what it is.
381637	384099	Anyway, I don't mean to make him sit there quietly.
384159	386541	Of course, I want to introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
386581	387062	Hi, Loki.
388082	388283	Hi.
388583	389083	Welcome back.
389123	389704	How was your break?
390745	391465	Yeah, it was alright.
391645	392906	I saw you were... I say busy.
393226	398989	I know, I was going to say, I saw you were busy producing Minecraft videos because I saw you had a new one go up that was like your season kickoff.
399549	401450	So, yeah, so I saw that.
401510	403951	I think I literally wrote a comment that was like supportive comment.
404611	405652	It was supportive comment.
405832	406252	Yes, it was.
406532	409934	Because I didn't know what else to say and I was like, well, I just want the algorithm.
410094	411114	That's all I'm doing.
411254	412435	I do this for the algorithm.
413729	415991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
436465	437265	and DarkSakura.
456474	480076	our hard drives are full and to the like half a percent of Twitch users of which VOG Network was very much one of that have too much video in their archives we're going to start auto deleting I think my personal channel has this problem too but they say we're going to start auto deleting stuff over 100 hours so unfortunately not our choice but Twitch will now no longer allow you to watch this show beyond two weeks on video um
481297	491825	I've been going back in and trying to download all my old VODs, but I use them lately for doing video content that we will be talking about the place I'm trying to upload this stuff to later.
492065	505035	Yes, and I will say that, well, this is also weighing on my mind because I have given a second thought because of all of this to maybe we should put all the video on YouTube and then...
505956	510737	We'll talk about something later where I'm like, nothing, nothing works on this fucking internet anymore.
510877	512617	Nothing works on the internet.
513978	515378	AI is ruining everything.
515938	516398	I hate it.
517458	519479	Anyway, let's see.
519719	526780	Bobby Blackwolf says there are some landmark OLR episodes that I did not delete, but episode 1000 was never archived to Twitch.
526880	528401	I still have the recording of it somewhere.
528421	529341	I'm pretty sure.
530061	532521	So I have the intro if nothing else.
532541	533902	I'm pretty sure I have episode 1000 somewhere.
533922	534002	So.
536624	538205	Anyway, let's see.
538245	542626	But yes, the podcast Sans video is up on YouTube.
542666	549548	We've been doing that for a while, ever since Google Podcasts or whatever they were calling that, ever since that kind of faded to black.
549768	551169	It kind of merged in with YouTube.
551509	553189	And so our audio shows go to YouTube.
553629	554590	So there is that.
556010	559372	Yeah, and Mike Def says, you know, the video would be pretty great to have.
559452	567156	Well, the whole fact that we can't really offer that to Twitch subscribers anymore has me thinking about it, but, you know, more thinking to come.
567456	579543	Anyway, what I really wanted to ask was, Loki, you have video that plays behind you as we broadcast live, and you have the Game Boy Classic Super Mario Land, which I have randomly been thinking about lately, too.
579603	583525	What made you say, I want to revisit Super Mario Land?
587009	601213	Super Mario Land was kind of an underrated game in some ways.
601413	609635	I mean, it was condensed because of the fact that it was on the Game Boy, but it brought some different things to the series that I kind of like.
609655	610595	And the music was great.
611275	612236	So, it's great.
612556	612776	Love it.
614478	617560	All right, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
617840	621421	And since we have been out for a couple weeks, so I went on a cruise.
621881	623562	I haven't really made that a secret.
623622	631005	I went on the Star Trek cruise for the fourth time, which is it's basically like a normal cruise.
631125	634286	It's a normal cruise, Royal Caribbean, but it's a charter cruise.
634726	637127	So it's nothing but Star Trek fans that are on the boat.
637527	641249	And most importantly, no kids.
642250	642851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
658172	659012	Cozumel.
659072	660473	We went to Costa Maya.
660953	664614	We did an excursion where we had an open bar in Costa Maya.
665134	672896	It was a beach and it had one of those swimming pools where you could actually swim up to the bar and that bartender.
672976	676317	So I went with Arya Snark or Victoria from Shaking and Crying.
676357	677557	And I know you know who this is.
678578	683459	I went with her and her buddy Siobhan from Rocky Horror in the Bay Area.
683519	684799	So her and I go way back too.
685119	687240	So the three of us were in that swim up pool and
687800	713856	and you know these are they are attractive ladies right that were you know kind of you know being nice talk to the bartender and that when I tell you that bartender brought the heavy pour because we were thinking oh open bar it's going to be some weak ass kool-aid drinks nope nope y'all I got fucked up in Mexico that was my Star Trek cruise experience and that was most likely the day I contracted COVID as well so you know so yeah unfortunately on the way back
715296	716737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
733943	745290	It's annoying because I just had COVID in September after DragonCon because it was too soon in October to get the vaccine.
745310	747532	So I was like, well, I'll get the vaccine two weeks before I go on the cruise.
747812	749613	So I got the vaccine two weeks before I went on the cruise.
750074	750674	Didn't matter.
750954	751334	LOL.
751394	752015	New strain.
753016	754536	And it's annoying.
754557	759220	I mean, of course, I know it's part of the risk and all that stuff, but when I tell you all...
760040	771487	The lovely mental refreshment being in the tropics during this time of year and being with these people on this cruise that I really adore and meeting a lot of new sci-fi nerds.
771507	773208	And it's really similar to my Khan family.
773248	774529	It's a very similar overlap.
774569	779432	In fact, there are people at the Star Trek cruise that I then see at Dragon Con later in the year.
780012	781433	It's just so good.
781473	785196	So it's a bummer that it had the ending that it had, but yay drugs!
786536	787417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
809912	830667	I guess ultimately it's Matt's choice but my opinion is not right to bring that show back in any form without Eddie but maybe some type of like new Trek show I would love to see and I would love to see Victoria because she's never she went on this cruise and she had never seen Trek any of it but she was like I heard it's a good crowd she had a great time
832600	835402	I don't think you need to know Trek to have a good time.
836603	839965	But she's a big cosplayer, so she dressed up every single theme night.
840306	841146	She did her research.
841206	842667	She's like, a Ryza party?
842727	843768	Okay, what's that all about?
844108	850352	She did her research, and her and Siobhan had these lovely tropical homemade gowns from the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race that looked phenomenal.
850372	851113	They got their picture taken.
851313	854635	Their picture in their Ryza outfits was up on the main screen the next day.
855236	859118	So, you know, yeah, she's great at the cosplay game, so...
860481	861121	She had a good time.
862102	862362	Let's see.
862402	866824	Small Shay in chat says, I'm not aware of the Trek stuff, but should I consider getting into it?
867224	868504	I do need more things to watch.
868984	873586	I enjoy it because I enjoy the hopeful vision of the future, you know, for the most part.
873626	883410	Like, obviously there's villains and antagonists and not everything is pretty, but I enjoy the vision of humanity coming together under a common goal that Star Trek provides.
884411	886671	And yeah, TigerCon chat says you might like Lower Decks.
886992	887932	You'd be surprised.
888232	896679	I would also strongly recommend Lower Decks as a really good entry point into Star Trek because it's completely unserious.
897240	901183	It's basically Futurama in the Trek universe, let's be real.
901664	903886	And so there might be a couple things...
904386	905307	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
925524	929546	and not really like a serial show like most people enjoyed with Star Trek.
929566	934728	Strange New Worlds is more like that, which is also pretty decent.
934768	937089	The only bad thing they've put out is Section 31.
937489	938770	That's the only bad thing they've put out.
938890	940911	Otherwise, most of the new Trek's pretty good.
941391	943372	Nothing is as good as Deep Space Nine for me.
943809	954915	You know, in Deep Space Nine, they've been talking a lot about how Deep Space Nine had quite the renaissance because of our streaming culture and specifically the pandemic and people binge watching things.
955095	963359	And my understanding is that Deep Space Nine is such a different watch when you binge it than it was in the 90s when most of us watched it.
964119	967881	Just because of the nature of you don't have to keep waiting for what the next part is.
968342	970063	There's documentaries that have been done on this shit.
970103	970723	It's pretty wild.
970803	973465	So yeah, Deep Space Nine, it's good.
973485	975546	I go back and watch certain episodes though.
976267	988034	There are just some episodes of that that are so... And the thing I like about Deep Space Nine is that it kind of steps a little bit away from the Roddenberry utopia where everyone's happy because we all have everything.
988554	995118	And it shows what happens if you're living in a utopian society and you take away the things that make it a utopia.
996558	999160	It was a lot more realistic to me.
999320	1000060	Anyway, sorry.
1000080	1003462	PodCulture in chat says Voyager is getting some love now too, finally.
1003522	1007744	Yeah, this particular cruise was a 30th anniversary of Voyager celebration.
1007804	1012367	So everybody from Voyager, except Beltran, was there, which was great.
1012987	1016609	Beltran's kind of a loon now, so it's fine that he didn't come.
1017650	1022033	So everybody else, this is the first time, first time that Robert Duncan McNeil actually came to the cruise.
1022053	1022673	That was a big deal.
1022713	1025876	Tom Paris finally showed up and it was great.
1026416	1028357	Yeah, so the Voyager stuff was incredible.
1028878	1038324	And I will say this, so the cruise entertainment, so instead of like Broadway plays or music events, it's all Trek-themed shit, right?
1038344	1038424	Yeah.
1038824	1067223	so which is still and again you don't have to watch Trek to understand it it might be like um the guy that plays Neelix and the hologram doctor sing songs by the Rat Pack or last year when I love Robert Picardo though he's great last year when Anthony he was behind us on our flight out there if you can believe it yeah him and his wife were behind us if you can believe it um so uh because we we paid for the extra leg room we were in first class we were an extra leg room and he was right behind us I guess he that the cruise production will only pony up the money for that for him
1067683	1068824	So, but he's great.
1069025	1070266	But they'll sing like songs from Rap Pack.
1070366	1074310	I will say last year, Anthony Rapp, who's in Discovery, right?
1074890	1078374	Because, and he's very well known from Broadway and Rent and all that.
1078734	1082618	He did an hour-long cabaret last year, which was fucking phenomenal.
1082898	1083739	He wasn't there this year.
1083819	1084760	Wilson Cruz was.
1084880	1089665	I feel like we get one or the other from the Discovery gay couple every year, but never both.
1090306	1090566	But...
1092162	1098404	Kate Mulgrew on the last night just did a one hour, I'm going to hold the mic and talk some shit.
1098504	1100425	Like that was, and it was everything.
1100825	1105706	My liberal auntie got up on stage and she had some shit to say and it was amazing.
1106106	1106787	I loved it.
1107187	1107787	She's fearless.
1108167	1113969	And of course she took some questions from the audience and somebody asked, can you tell us, huh?
1115049	1116450	Did she do any Dragon Age stuff?
1116510	1116890	No, no.
1116910	1117810	It was Star Trek.
1117991	1119131	She was my Flemeth.
1119311	1122333	The only... Orange is the New Black came up once.
1122633	1124194	That's the only other thing that came up.
1124414	1125754	Not even Miss Columbo or anything.
1126215	1131297	But she was asked, can you clarify the rumors?
1131457	1135920	I don't know if you're allowed to talk about it, but can you tell us where does the Janeway show stand?
1136380	1139521	And her answer in the beautiful Kate Mulgrew way... I can't even do an impersonation.
1139561	1139962	I wish I could.
1140002	1140302	She's like...
1140822	1145823	Well, nobody can tell me what I can and can't say, so sure, we can talk about the Janeway series.
1146604	1148944	And she's basically like, what do you all think?
1149044	1150905	Do you think we should do the Janeway series?
1150925	1157407	She's like, I've not really wanted to do it because I just don't know if there's a reason right now.
1157447	1159027	There's got to be a reason for it.
1159247	1160127	It's not just nostalgia.
1160147	1162128	There's got to be a reason to bring back Janeway.
1162528	1168770	And she's like, but do you think maybe in the way the world is right now, maybe we need a little something that Voyager brought us?
1168830	1169970	Maybe we need a little hope?
1170770	1172231	Do we need a little hope right now?
1172511	1173492	And everybody's cheering and screaming.
1174032	1180577	I seriously think she either talked herself on that stage into answering those phone calls about Janeway or it's happening.
1181938	1183559	I think that Janeway show is happening.
1184199	1185160	I'm like, just...
1185620	1190183	Based, again, I don't want to start rumors and shit, and there better not be any fucking reporters that are going to run it.
1190284	1193806	I mean, there's already, I'm sure, been talk on what she said on Star Trek Cruise.
1194206	1197129	Don't run away with it, but like, I, just the vibes.
1197369	1198349	I'm going off vibes.
1198490	1199710	I am reporting on vibes.
1199991	1201772	We do that on Gaming Podcasts sometimes.
1202132	1203293	I think a Janeway show is happening.
1203433	1203834	I really do.
1204354	1205595	And I can't, I can't fucking wait.
1206455	1206596	So.
1207645	1210787	Yeah, S2100 Matt says, more Kate Mulgrew is reason enough.
1210987	1211587	Absolutely.
1212168	1212788	Absolutely.
1212968	1213288	All right.
1214009	1218972	Tiger Claw says, a Janeway show and some of the original cast returning would be great.
1219592	1223774	I think every single person, save Beltran, would return.
1224154	1224755	I really do.
1225195	1227096	I don't think there's anyone on that cast who wouldn't return.
1227737	1231779	I think Janeway should kidnap Picard and go out to the Delta Quadrant.
1234131	1234872	Oh, I'm sorry.
1234892	1235213	That's right.
1235253	1238779	Meanwhile, you're resurrecting Todd's character.
1239238	1241319	Sorry, PodCulture's reminding me about Kes.
1241739	1243559	Sorry, yeah, I also forgot about Kes.
1243859	1245700	So no, no, she won't be coming either.
1246160	1250581	She was effectively replaced by Seven of Nine on the main cast.
1250641	1258963	And so my brain thinks of Jerry Ryan, who I absolutely, I think she, I think Jerry Ryan is in a place where she loves Trek more maybe than she did originally.
1258983	1260104	I loved her in Picard.
1260444	1262004	Yeah, she was so good in Picard.
1262024	1262444	She was so good.
1262604	1266245	And we all, again, I'm trying not to spoil, but the show has been over for some time now.
1266725	1268006	The way that Picard ended-
1268886	1270927	We all want to see that fucking show.
1271407	1274469	We all want to see that fucking show where Picard entered.
1275129	1279711	And spoiler alert, it has to do with Jerry Ryan and her new status on the Enterprise.
1280291	1286034	And some of the Picard supporting characters carrying over into that too, including Michelle Hurd, who I fucking love as well.
1286734	1289476	I can't remember Todd's character's name, the other captain.
1289516	1290236	Well, Shaw.
1290256	1291336	The Titan?
1291576	1291837	Shaw.
1292097	1295158	Oh, he's confirmed for the cruise next year, actually.
1295238	1296059	He's a fan favorite.
1296199	1296839	Yeah, we love him.
1297139	1324450	I would love to go if he's going to be there just because, I mean I liked him on The Riches and Supernatural and everything I love Stashwick, he's a nerd and he gets so into it he's fucking great, I'm glad they got him back he's a big comic and gaming guy but unfortunately you know the events of Picard may make it difficult for him to come back at the same time, if Data came back they can figure it out
1325916	1326796	They love their multi-person.
1355971	1356951	Nintendo Online.
1357371	1359472	The gold points from Nintendo was announced.
1359492	1361312	The gold points will be discontinued in March.
1361692	1365513	So gold points has been Nintendo's sort of way of like the kickback points.
1365893	1371674	When you buy things on Nintendo Online, you get the gold points and then you can use those to get money off of future things.
1371734	1372875	Those are going to be discontinued.
1373175	1378436	And also your Nintendo Switch Online vouchers will not work with Switch 2 games.
1378976	1384079	They're not going to work, which I think is kind of obvious, but it's been clarified that will not be happening.
1384959	1386280	Any strong opinions on this?
1386520	1388921	I mean, it seems a little soon for the goal points to be ending.
1389282	1390182	Yeah, but it's not.
1390822	1397226	Maybe they weren't getting as much, like, I don't know, return on investment with it.
1397386	1397846	I don't know.
1398406	1399947	I just use mine right away anyway.
1400247	1401308	Here's what I think it is.
1401428	1403489	I think so many people are buying digital now.
1403729	1406391	They don't need the incentive to get people to buy digital anymore.
1407322	1409924	You still get points for buying digital anyways.
1411684	1412145	That's true.
1412545	1414966	I would just use mine immediately anyway.
1415767	1421710	And it's negligible for any sort of added value.
1422350	1426533	Well, they could have thrown it in where they could say, oh, you accrue...
1428396	1437504	10% additional points or whatever if you're enrolled in Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pass or something like that, you know, like the sweeten the deal a little bit.
1437785	1444591	Well, and to be fair, I don't want to set expectations unreasonably, but get out the wheel of plausibility, everybody.
1444731	1445372	Bring it on out.
1445572	1446052	Bring it on out.
1447045	1458254	Perhaps the reason they're going to end this in March is that with the April Switch 2 announcement, they could be announcing a new kind of loyalty incentive program that maybe is going to be a little different in one way or the other.
1458634	1463398	So that – I mean the timing is pretty convenient with the April announcement and what could happen there.
1463518	1472485	So just a thought to put on the wheel of plausibility as we eagerly await before too long now the April announcements of what the Switch 2 could be all about.
1472965	1473085	So –
1473866	1475467	Okay, let's see.
1476248	1478929	There was also a Pokemon Presents that happened.
1479310	1485313	So the biggest part of the Pokemon Presents was getting to see Pokemon Legends Z to A, which looks so cool.
1485614	1487495	They're changing up the battles significantly.
1487555	1491597	They're going to be more real-time battles, which we haven't really seen in Pokemon.
1491637	1495500	I mean, unless you count like the extreme spinoff games like Mystery Dungeon and stuff.
1495540	1496661	But I don't know.
1496721	1498362	Legends is kind of mainline to me.
1498442	1500223	Legends is like adjacent mainline right now.
1500603	1528011	and so like to see like the live stuff come to that game is I think going to be very very interesting so I will be eagerly awaiting that there's some other stuff too that has to do with like the anime and stuff and you know some codes and you know whatever but the Z to A stuff was really the big stuff we also heard that Fable from Microsoft not going to happen until 2026 so don't expect Fable this year this game's taken a long time to happen they showed some gameplay though
1528171	1528931	Yeah, yeah.
1529191	1529552	What'd you think?
1529612	1530532	I didn't see the gameplay.
1530732	1531192	Did you see it?
1531312	1531692	How was it?
1532073	1533033	I mean, it looks like Fable.
1534033	1535494	It doesn't look bad.
1535614	1536574	It just looks like Fable.
1536634	1541476	Well, the big thing, obviously, with this is that the Forza Horizon gang is getting in on Fable.
1541556	1545238	So, of course, there's a huge... Because the Forza Horizon games fucking kick ass.
1545278	1545858	I think you all know.
1546278	1551781	So, them doing Fable is very... You know, I think we were all kind of a little curious what that's going to look like.
1552081	1552201	So...
1552995	1553335	For sure.
1553395	1554035	Yeah, for sure.
1555276	1555556	Let's see.
1555636	1562958	Oh, the Goldmaster series out of Digital Eclipse is going to be getting some physical editions, including Tetris Forever, the most recent Goldmaster.
1563058	1566759	So a score a win for physical editions for those that like to collect those.
1567439	1576882	I think that's actually really cool, too, especially if Digital Eclipse is really trying to sell themselves as a criterion collection of video games, which is what these feels like sometimes.
1577282	1579884	People don't want to own the Criterion Collection digitally.
1579904	1583727	Well, those words are going to leave my mouth and somebody's going to say, I own them digitally.
1583787	1584988	Of course, of course, you're different.
1585989	1590533	But most people like to have those Criterion Collection discs on hand.
1590573	1591714	That's a big draw of it.
1592034	1593595	So I think it's smart.
1594016	1600221	I got to admit, as a gaming fan, I am kind of tempted to build up a collection.
1600961	1602683	I don't know why, but I just feel the need.
1603996	1605077	I'm a consumer whore.
1605257	1605757	And Hal.
1606078	1606798	And Hal.
1607499	1608039	Exactly.
1609541	1610041	Let's see.
1611382	1617027	MK1, Mortal Kombat 1 is going to be getting the T-1000 from Terminator will be coming.
1617627	1622271	That is going to include Robert Patrick returning to do the voice of the T-1000.
1622311	1622571	Good time.
1625576	1626836	Have you seen this, boy?
1629118	1633340	Bloober team is working on a new game based on Konami intellectual property.
1652870	1655573	Could that be another Silent Hill or an original?
1655613	1657375	We haven't heard anything about Silent Hill F in a while.
1657395	1659858	It could be a really good Silent Hill 3 remake.
1660739	1661299	Maybe?
1661780	1662741	Or could it be like a new game?
1662761	1663502	Silent Hill 3 is great.
1664670	1665731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1683761	1712843	usually this is code for the product we saw at the benchmark check-in did not meet expectations and that's that that you don't read that as the game was bad that could be we didn't see how we could make boatloads of money off of this so we're not pouring any more money into this and you know they learned a very hard lesson with Suicide Squad and so I don't know there could be some things into that but anyway um so Wonder Woman unfortunately is not going to happen which is
1714138	1714879	I don't know.
1715539	1718622	Wonder Woman is a character I don't like to see getting shit on.
1718882	1720563	Especially during International Women's Month.
1722585	1725227	Leave it to Zaslav during International Women's Month.
1725247	1726288	No one cares about us.
1726508	1730832	If they did, some certain person wouldn't be elected.
1731152	1731552	I care.
1731813	1732213	I try.
1732954	1733214	I try.
1733234	1733954	You know what I mean, Rob.
1734054	1734295	I know.
1734375	1735536	I know exactly what you mean.
1736617	1738218	I'm trying not to not all-men this.
1738278	1738938	I really am.
1738958	1739399	Yeah.
1740094	1743036	Okay, anyway, let's see.
1743216	1752762	Speaking of the Terminator stuff, a brand new 2D game called Terminator 2D No Fate, inspired by the movie, is going to be happening as well.
1752862	1754803	And yeah, as Loki said.
1755103	1755884	It's Contra.
1756064	1757104	I mean, essentially.
1757145	1757885	No, it's not.
1758005	1759766	It's Legally Distinct Contra.
1759806	1760827	Legally Distinct Contra.
1761087	1762848	Because we have Terminator characters.
1762868	1764349	With some strong homages.
1764369	1764509	Yes.
1765790	1769032	Wouldn't that be funny if the up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right code worked in that game?
1769983	1770283	DarkSakura
1780785	1784007	I was like, okay, yeah, I know exactly what this is from.
1784147	1784767	Yeah, right.
1785687	1786408	So, good times.
1787208	1790410	Alright, so that's everything I had on what we missed over the last couple weeks.
1790430	1794552	I don't know if you had anything extra you wanted to share, Loki, from before the second or whatever.
1794572	1800875	Yeah, I was going to say real quick, there was a roadmap that looked very plain anyways of
1801695	1822762	uh what Mojang's well their roadmap was for Minecraft for the next like four years and one of the things I mean aside from just like the quarterly updates that they're doing to the game and some like movie tie-in stuff and product tie-in stuff and all that they're always doing um one of the things that was on there was uh Minecraft Spice or Project Spicewood
1823581	1826001	which Spice World coming to Minecraft?
1826062	1826962	Oh, I'm so excited.
1826982	1828462	Spice World, Spice Wood.
1828822	1830602	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1830702	1833063	No, no Spice World.
1833903	1836404	But there was screenshots that leaked from it.
1836484	1838404	It's a sequel to Minecraft Dungeons.
1838724	1839764	Or at least that's what it looks like.
1840624	1841745	Okay, that might be interesting.
1841765	1844185	Look forward to that in about a year.
1844365	1846246	I'd like to see them elaborate on that a little bit.
1846366	1848446	I think a second Minecraft Dungeons game could be pretty cool.
1849079	1851820	Yeah, because Legends wasn't so great.
1852560	1854921	But Dungeons was pretty good.
1855161	1856401	Okay, yeah, I like Dungeons.
1857322	1858362	I don't get super into Minecraft.
1858382	1861983	I probably played more Dungeons than any of the other Minecraft games.
1862123	1864624	Because I love me a dungeon crawler.
1864704	1865504	Surprise, surprise.
1865744	1867045	So, yeah, it was good.
1867465	1870546	Yeah, and that's what I was hoping Legends was supposed to be.
1870586	1875567	But then it was just some weird thing that really didn't mesh well with anything.
1876207	1877968	Is the Minecraft movie this month or next month?
1878732	1879433	That's next month.
1879573	1879853	Okay.
1880214	1880895	It's soon though.
1880915	1881756	It's right around the corner.
1882337	1883198	You gotta be nervous.
1883518	1884399	You gotta be nervous.
1885000	1885781	I'm not nervous.
1885881	1887303	My expectations are low.
1888885	1894226	That's a good place to keep them.
1894266	1901107	It doesn't look horrible, but I don't like the dumbing down for the audience type of thing.
1901328	1905528	And I get it that kids watch it too, but give the kids some credit, please.
1906049	1908889	You don't have to shout out all the game mechanics.
1909489	1913030	They have a bunch of clips of it too where Jack Black's like...
1913450	1915971	I'm going to use my water bucket to cushion our fall.
1916151	1917432	That's a crafting table.
1917772	1919273	Ooh, Flint and Steel.
1919433	1920533	Ooh, another portal.
1920654	1925376	Ooh, it's... It's like, stop shouting out the game stuff.
1925596	1927297	You know, it's Electra Wingsuit.
1927437	1928597	Like, just stop.
1928677	1931699	Like, the kids that are going to go see the movie are going to understand what that is.
1931999	1935721	And if they don't understand, then that makes them curious, and then they go figure it out.
1936061	1937942	But stop, like, wasting everybody's time with...
1938542	1939962	shouting out what things are.
1940083	1941103	Oh, I saw a tree.
1941143	1941803	Oh, a cow.
1942563	1943624	It's not interesting.
1944884	1946424	So that's the only thing.
1946885	1952146	It seems like a lot of these projects nowadays, it's bad writing that really kind of hampers them a lot.
1953666	1954407	So we'll see.
1954667	1955207	I don't know.
1955307	1956087	But I mean...
1959665	1960826	It's going to be ridiculous.
1961707	1962428	I'll go see it.
1962628	1968012	Mike Deft in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, I hate when media treats their audience as if they're dumb.
1968193	1978562	Yeah, and we've seen this happen with video game movies a lot, which is why I think when the Witcher happened, which again, I know it's a novel, but let's be real, the game really helped.
1979302	2003152	to see something like that that was taken very seriously you know in the way that it was adapted I think is part of the reason why it was so successful right like it didn't have to be so ridiculous in the way it called things out like name check things from the game and stuff like that or you know whatever trademarks the company my owner is trying to push product on right like right yeah I think the best dialogue is the one you don't have to write yes that's right that's not forced
2004806	2007228	No, just sometimes the silence tells more.
2008809	2009369	Good acting.
2009489	2011751	Yeah, true, true.
2011811	2013572	Good direction with good acting.
2014032	2016874	Well, let's talk about the directions of our gaming weeks.
2016934	2018575	Oh, I'm sorry, Loki, I should see if you have anything else.
2018595	2020396	I just assumed the Minecraft thing was the big one.
2020416	2021537	No, that was pretty much it.
2022158	2023659	Cool, then we'll talk about our gaming weeks.
2023679	2026560	The action figures for the movie are top notch.
2027401	2028382	They're out already.
2028402	2028962	Oh, are they?
2029442	2029923	Did you buy them?
2029943	2030103	Yeah.
2031076	2039618	No, but one of our other cast members on Channel 64 did, and yeah, it's something.
2039798	2041278	Oh boy, alright, alright.
2041818	2048679	Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks, and you know, you can dip into the last couple weeks as well if you want, but generally, how was your gaming week?
2048699	2049560	We'll start with DarkSakura.
2051360	2055021	It was Dead by Daylight, Dragon Age, The Veil Guard...
2057023	2058084	I played some Palia.
2059064	2067129	I played a few other things, mostly dicked around a little bit with some N64 stuff.
2067549	2073612	And I made sure that my copy of Dobutsu no Mori, my English translation works.
2074573	2078915	And I'm saying Nintendo 64, Dobutsu no Mori, as in Animal Forest.
2079835	2080756	Because I'm going to stream it.
2082056	2082637	I think it'll be fun.
2082897	2088922	Because my next plan is to actually start playing New Horizons again.
2089863	2093266	To dust off my village and see what it's like two years later.
2095168	2098771	You can't visit other people's towns in the N64 version, can you?
2098891	2100773	Or was that actually a thing with memory cards?
2100833	2101533	Okay, I couldn't remember.
2101553	2103255	That was never a thing on that version.
2104156	2106258	Okay, so teensy bit of history.
2107580	2114241	It was, I think, only eight months later that the GameCube one came out for Dobutsu no Mori.
2114942	2118842	And that's when they implemented things that they'd wanted to have in the first one.
2118902	2125324	Like, for example, the model for Blathers is in Dobutsu no Mori on N64.
2126584	2129625	The museum was actually fully implemented in the...
2131185	2131806	GameCube one.
2132266	2145776	And they had a thing where if you sent in your GameCube, not GameCube, your N64 saves to transfer to a memory card for GameCube, so they transfer your village for you for a small fee.
2146396	2147878	You also get Ice Climber.
2149499	2156004	That was, the other way you would get Ice Climber is they had like a brief contest to where you'd get this like game pack.
2156986	2183901	that would attach and you could get Ice Climber that way but there were like there was a very limited amount number of them and then we got Animal Crossing and they did a lot to Animal Crossing over what was in Dobutsu no Mori Plus which was the first GameCube one and they liked ours so much that they came out with Dobutsu no Mori E Plus which had the e-reader
2185636	2192362	and then there was also the IQ version, which is actually the N64 one.
2193283	2197346	The IQ being the Chinese game player that isn't a game player, it's an education device.
2198732	2207056	So there were something like five or six different versions of just Doubutsu no Mori, the first run of it.
2207336	2219461	Now that you say it, and I remember that a big selling point of Animal Crossing in the US was it came with its own memory card because the file was so fucking big it took up an entire memory card.
2219901	2220662	Ice Climber Balloon Fight
2234537	2241366	Yeah, I think it was Balloon Fight, but the four games that were not conventionally available... I mean, they did the Super Mario Bros.
2241467	2244851	e-reader card, and they did an Ice Climber e-reader card.
2246213	2247074	Good luck finding them.
2247795	2249317	But it was Legend of Zelda, and...
2252165	2253646	I think Metroid was in there.
2253927	2255128	Metroid, that's right, Metroid.
2255328	2255889	It was those two.
2256809	2273505	And there was some convoluted way that people were supposed to get The Legend of Zelda, but I've been following actually this one really good YouTube channel where he goes into the code and they actually have now released tools so that you can do you can't do nook codes
2274386	2283961	for the systems, but he figured out how to make the game pack ones and the custom villagers that they had for E+.
2285483	2287206	So all kinds of different stuff.
2287326	2288628	He has a Piplup in his village.
2289952	2299324	I thought there was a way they discovered back in the day like if you named your character Link and you named your village Hyrule they reversed engineered like codes for every single thing in the game.
2299344	2300065	That was Project Hyrule.
2300145	2301026	Okay, okay.
2301266	2305832	They have since learned how to do that without having to have a village named Hyrule.
2305872	2306553	Okay, okay.
2306993	2307354	That's it.
2308514	2322659	yeah but yeah so I've been actually on a deep dive into just Animal Crossing like behind the scenes stuff and seeing how fucking broken the code is there's all kinds of ways you can get into like the first beta map
2323559	2331202	by a little glitch for when you come out of Nook's Cranny or whatever it was back in the day.
2333162	2335203	And then just some different lore stuff.
2335243	2335943	It was pretty cool.
2337944	2347527	And then, actually, something that Dan and I are probably going to be getting, and I'm telling you this because I think Alan might be interested in this as well.
2348887	2372407	it's called the SAROO S-A-R-O-O and it is a optical drive emulator for the Sega Saturn that cuts loading time basically I mean it's got the full games loaded on it but it cuts the load time like significantly which would be great for actually playing King of Fighters
2373038	2401752	interesting of course I own the games I would want to play etc etc but it would be good to play the English translations hmm interesting I'll have to ask him if he's heard of it yeah and it's just a card by the way it's just a card if it's in the RAM card slot oh that's cool yeah so that's been on the list and just you know playing random shooters and whatever I'm still kind of addicted to Fruit Mountain
2403365	2403666	Alright.
2405411	2407598	Well, with that, we'll travel on over to Loki.
2407658	2408501	How was your gaming weeks?
2410387	2438814	well I pretty much was working on Minecraft stuff so I put out two episodes kind of a lore epilogue to my season three because it just didn't really feel right going into season four without some of that lore being brought over and it ties in with what I'm doing in this season so it kind of worked out better that way and then my first episode of season four and then I'm actually working on my second episode of season four I'm trying to get it
2439594	2468698	probably that could be like weekly but I'm trying to get it like close to you know seeing if I can just do less and put out more content that way so I'm going to try to get another episode out this week as well and yeah so it's been a lot of um working on Minecraft stuff and then a little bit of Bellatro um I finally got to a couple of the decks have the balanced version now so that's kind of fun um
2469895	2471736	Yeah, just playing through that stuff.
2472577	2474438	I forgot to mention I've been playing Bellatro.
2474878	2475218	Really?
2475539	2476039	Interesting.
2476459	2480042	I guess I need to try it again and see if it clicks for me another time.
2482093	2482333	All right.
2483114	2483715	My gaming weeks.
2483875	2489300	Obviously, I've been pretty busy with traveling and all that, but I did have some time this week to get into some games.
2490021	2491963	I've been playing my standbys.
2492023	2494005	I'm almost done with the season in Diablo 4.
2494045	2501293	I've gotten all the way to Torment 4, and I think my battle pass is at level 87, so I only need to put in a little more time, and I should clear out the battle pass.
2501913	2529038	I would love to clear out the last page to get I think there's like a Raven pet or something you get but I'm like the grinds are almost a bit much for me so I don't know if I'll finish because I want to play some other games as well I don't want to just play Diablo 4 all day every day I do want to play some new games and I actually did get around to a couple new games this week the first is the very recent Suikoden 1 and 2 remaster that just came out on pretty much all platforms I picked it up on PlayStation 5 and so I started diving in a little bit to Suikoden on the PlayStation or
2529778	2532762	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2545600	2546381	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2563112	2564433	But I'm enjoying it.
2564753	2573839	I can already tell there's definite quality of life things that they have in this, like being able to speed up the battles, the way nice things look and fill out the screen in 16x9.
2573899	2579123	The profile pictures of everybody have been redone and they look nice.
2580163	2582485	I understand the story has been retranslated.
2583125	2591791	I am not a huge enough fan to pick up all the nuance of what's been translated, but it seems the story is interesting enough so far and all that good stuff.
2593192	2594473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2616100	2620241	I really don't remember it super well, like what even happened in the story and stuff.
2620281	2623782	So I'm almost approaching it like it's a new game, but it's fine.
2623883	2624203	It's fun.
2624423	2624723	I like it.
2625803	2634666	The other game I've been spending some time with is Microsoft's Avowed from Obsidian Entertainment, which just also, I think it came out right before I left on the cruise.
2635506	2641648	So I spent some time this week catching up on it and I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit more than I thought I would.
2642728	2647771	I think it's getting a lot of comparisons to Elder Scrolls, which is interesting because I posted about that on Blue Sky.
2647851	2656756	One of our listeners kind of replied going, it's not the greatest comparison because, you know, Elder Scrolls is so, you know, this is nonlinear.
2656776	2662280	Avowed is... I would agree that Avowed is not as open.
2662920	2667523	I mean, it's still open world, don't get me wrong, and there's still like all these different quests, but I would say in some ways...
2668303	2697712	I wouldn't see necessarily all of that as a negative is that it's not so open versus Elder Scrolls because sometimes in Elder Scrolls like you're almost like you're so overwhelmed with all of the different things to do you never stay on track so I feel like Avowed is a little bit more of a traditional RPG I guess in that sense but I think the graphics are nice it's a very pretty game I really enjoy the combat I've been trying to like play a mage style yeah QuestBuster in chat says Avowed is a lot of fun exploring off the beaten path is really rewarding yeah
2698072	2698712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2720087	2720928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2737401	2757214	I think for fans of that kind of RPG genre I think you're going to really like it and even if you're not like a big Elder Scrolls person I liked it just kind of like it's like an action type of fighting sort of game I want to spend some more time with it I'm sort of torn now between putting hours in Suikoden versus putting hours in Avowed but I want to definitely play more Avowed because I enjoyed it for sure
2759055	2784969	uh quest master said there's also a lot of ways to solve many of the quests with major decisions changing the game in subtle or huge ways yeah i definitely noticed that kind of bioware sort of touch with which again elder scrolls has the multiple options for how you answer things too but i i i kind of got more of a bioware feeling from the way avowed was implementing it and maybe that's because you can see when you don't have the stats to do a certain something and
2785169	2789751	You'll see, and you can't, which I think is interesting, it doesn't even tell you what the option is.
2790291	2795013	It just says, like, perception, one of three gray dashes.
2795293	2797994	So you don't even know what it would have said, which I think is interesting.
2798054	2800716	I guess maybe they're trying to play into replayability value.
2801036	2804837	But there's so many options anyway.
2804917	2805898	So it's just, I don't know.
2806758	2812180	And the other thing I learned through Avowed, the fish man is...
2813721	2817007	A lot more attractive than I think he should be for a fish man.
2817508	2820955	And I was like, why am I so attracted to fish man?
2822418	2827500	But I learned Fishman is voiced by the same person that voiced Garrus.
2828380	2830181	I thought he sounded familiar.
2830601	2833142	I was like, why does this sound so familiar?
2833602	2834942	And then it hit me in one scene.
2834982	2837263	I was like, is this Garrus's voice actor?
2837583	2840304	And then I went and looked it up and I was like, oh, it is.
2840384	2842505	Yeah, Mike Deff says Rob's Shape of Water moment.
2842985	2845766	It was suddenly that movie makes a lot more sense.
2850959	2856801	I'm being a little silly, maybe, but seriously, I just was a little, I was like, the fish man's really attractive.
2858142	2859622	Even if he has sharp teeth.
2862343	2864624	Questbuster says he almost never left my party.
2864664	2865564	He's such a good tank.
2865624	2865905	See?
2866445	2869306	And he's effective, especially if you're going to be like a magic person.
2870365	2873008	Anyway, all right, let's move on.
2873068	2874330	That's it for our gaming weeks.
2874830	2876732	I don't have a lot of housekeeping for now.
2876833	2881638	We've got, you know, I took my vacation, so I'm out of vacation time for a good long time.
2882639	2884121	So we'll be here.
2884562	2885723	So anyway, let's move on.
2885783	2888326	Let's talk about what's going on in gaming news.
2888867	2889848	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2890939	2897701	Yes, so you know, in this economy, it's hard to buy these expensive brand new gaming systems.
2897801	2904404	Well, Sony's looking right out for you because they're going to offer the PlayStation 5 for rent.
2904724	2908245	Now, this is kind of similar to, I think, Microsoft did something similar.
2908265	2910246	It was less of a rent, more of like kind of
2911226	2913467	It was cable contracts or something.
2913487	2914228	It was that whole thing.
2914248	2918050	It was like, if you sign a three-year... Oh, it was a mobile phone contract.
2918311	2924555	If you sign a three-year contract to have Game Pass or something, we'll throw in the Xbox 360 or whatever it was at that time.
2924615	2925275	Yeah, yeah.
2925355	2935602	So essentially, they have different options you can choose from, including if you want to lease a pro console for 36 months or a digital edition for one year.
2936562	2936703	Um...
2937403	2942325	I'm curious on the pricing on this, if they even say.
2942885	2943425	Probably not.
2944566	2947527	But, yeah, there's other options, of course.
2948387	2953889	You can lease PlayStation VR 2, the Remote Portal Player
2954619	2980682	why would you do that i don't know uh but anyways uh playstation 5 pro console it ranges up from 18.95 euro a month um to lease that and then the digital version 13.49 a month um the slim 11.99 and then of course playstation vr is actually almost the same price as the whole console so that's
2981291	2982031	Pretty expensive.
2982151	2985873	They also sliced the price of the VR, too, not that long ago.
2986093	2988374	I think just before we were out.
2989175	2990415	Yeah.
2992116	2993817	I don't know if I would ever do that.
2993937	2997799	I don't think it's necessarily cheaper than buying the console.
2997819	3000220	The console itself is about $400.
3000760	3005242	So it's basically a couple years and you have it paid off.
3007323	3008064	I don't know, man.
3008084	3010485	You gotta lease a console for a while.
3011943	3014465	Maybe it's just not by the console.
3014905	3015385	Just wait.
3015465	3023631	There was a part of me that was wondering, and I'm going to admit I didn't do the time to do the math, but I know sometimes these rent-to-own things can be a little bit predatory, right?
3023651	3028014	Because I remember we just had an issue with one of those big computer companies.
3028134	3028674	NZXT?
3028894	3029295	Was it them?
3029315	3029855	Yeah.
3029955	3030335	Yes, yes.
3051696	3057598	appliances that cost a lot of money that people who live a little more paycheck to paycheck can't always afford.
3058098	3066041	So they get into these schemes where they end up paying like three, four times the price of what it would be to just buy it at a Sears outlet or something.
3066782	3075925	Yeah, and I don't know if you necessarily get the keep it though, like because a lot of these things, let's see here.
3078406	3080387	Yeah, they don't even ever talk about
3081203	3081703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3098278	3100180	What happens when it's time to upgrade?
3100200	3104303	At the end of your lease, you can simply upgrade for free and return your old device.
3104844	3108687	And then you have 14 days, it says, to transfer your data.
3109587	3115452	It says you can keep the device and continue paying monthly or cancel your lease and return your device.
3115913	3117254	So you don't get to keep it.
3118192	3119295	Interesting.
3119735	3121679	What are they going to do with all the old hardware?
3121820	3123984	I guess they flip it and sell it.
3124044	3129815	What I would do is first off, if you don't have a PlayStation 5 by now,
3131089	3131609	Just wait.
3131870	3137995	Just wait longer because you could probably get the first generation PlayStation 5s for people that upgraded.
3138015	3140437	A little bit less expensive.
3140657	3142258	Or just at this point, just wait.
3142518	3152447	Wait for the next thing that's coming out because it's been a few years already and who knows if they're going to have another refresh or if there's going to be some other price cuts and stuff.
3153367	3159532	What is it that's on PlayStation that's coming out soon that you really just need to rent a PlayStation to get it?
3159632	3160133	I just...
3161638	3172507	I can't imagine and then look at like the library like especially if you went the digital route yeah cool you got a library of games and now you return your device and you can't play those anymore like why would you do that
3174317	3177299	I would buy the console and just like, at least you could sell it later.
3177519	3180840	By the time 2026 is here, we're going to be talking about PlayStation 6.
3181360	3183461	Now, I don't know, you know, because, right?
3183501	3185302	We're on like a six year cycle at this point, right?
3185322	3186282	Because PlayStation 5 was 2020.
3186322	3186963	PlayStation 4 was 2014.
3187003	3188003	PlayStation 3 was maybe 2007, 2008.
3188203	3189804	You know, PlayStation 2 was 2008.
3195866	3198508	1?
3197327	3198508	Everything is a blur at this point.
3198548	3199889	So it's like a 6 or 7 year cycle.
3199909	3201010	Maybe I'm slightly wrong.
3201811	3208256	Honestly, I would say with everything that happened with the pandemic, I actually would not be surprised if PlayStation 6 wasn't until 2027 at this point.
3209637	3211919	But still, Loki, you make a good point.
3212499	3219404	At this point, either buy somebody's, use the upgrades to a pro, or just hold out for a PlayStation 6.
3220825	3247433	let's just say you did a 36 month lease, you're paying 50% more for that device than you would if you just and by that time, assuming that it's gone down in price, you could have purchased it for probably even half of the total amount it just doesn't seem to make sense to me to do it, and if you're really that hard up on cash, just do yourself a favor, go without it for
3249033	3274444	a little bit of time and you can save up the money to buy the system outright instead of paying monthly to do it just be patient save up if you really want it and then wait and purchase it because I can only tell you these systems are only going to get less expensive as time goes on just do the math make an informed decision do the math and make an informed decision
3275293	3293264	don't get locked into leases for a game console that is ridiculous don't put yourself in that position to ruin your credit perhaps or whatever I mean, I don't know do they have credit scores in the UK like we have over here?
3293284	3294245	just be satisfied
3295063	3297104	Do they have credit scores in the UK like we have over here?
3297264	3305627	Because I know it's notoriously an issue in the US about how the credit scores, like everything up over here.
3306227	3308308	But I guess that's a discussion for another show.
3308668	3323033	If your parents, say you're a child and your parents are loaded and they want to buy you a console, have them lease it for three years, put it in your name and have them make all the payments, there you go, your credit score goes up.
3324585	3328188	You can do that too, but like, yeah, I don't know.
3328769	3329189	Just wait.
3330410	3337456	Alright, well, on the flip side, hurry up and play this game because this game is about to go away, which is a little bit surprising.
3338176	3344502	I didn't really predict that games would leave Nintendo Switch Online ever, but here we are.
3344582	3346784	We are in the case where Super Soccer
3347584	3348484	is going to be pulled.
3349165	3353986	So this game is going to be pulled on March 28th, and that game will no longer be available.
3354046	3356466	Of course, no reason given by Nintendo for it.
3356526	3358287	I'm sure they don't want to advertise what it is.
3358727	3365569	We don't know if it's the rights or some other part of the agreement or what all is going on, but that game is going to be leaving.
3365609	3369130	And this leaves quite a few people shocked because we kind of assumed...
3370230	3379336	They were building a Netflix-style library of games, and granted, I guess shows come and go from Netflix, but at the same time, where the fuck else is Super Soccer going to go?
3379916	3385699	Is this a game that's in such heavy fucking demand that they're going to put out their own release of the game or something like that?
3385979	3386560	I just don't...
3387714	3399476	Like it's not like we're talking about, I don't know, Mega Man or something that we could see in a collection, which isn't even on the NSO because Capcom sells that Mega Man collection separately or something like that.
3400096	3406377	I just I don't understand what the rights holders have to gain from withholding this.
3407358	3413639	This is not exactly a must play game from the years, but all right, go off, I guess.
3413659	3414939	Maybe they're going like.
3415842	3429793	You know, the physical route with it again, gonna re-release it, like they do with all these, like, I Am 8-Bit, and, um, like the collectors type stuff, where it's a lot of obscure games that they put out.
3429873	3441922	Well, and let's be real, Super Soccer, it's not, it was by Human Entertainment, was the developers, and worldwide, Nintendo was the publisher, although in Japan, Human Entertainment published it, so, you know, I don't know if there's
3442502	3450244	Weird's issues with the rights holding there that maybe whoever owns the human entertainment stuff, maybe they're asking for more money now or something.
3450284	3451424	It's all – who knows?
3451504	3456285	Like we could – again, with Nintendo not saying anything, we have nothing left but to make shit up about what's going on.
3456885	3461326	So yeah, but I mean this – it wasn't that good of a soccer game either.
3461386	3461886	I'm sorry.
3461926	3462706	I'm just going to say it.
3462726	3466307	It wasn't that good of a soccer game compared to some of the other options out there.
3467344	3472627	They just put in, funny, I ran across it yesterday, speaking of classic games and stuff.
3473567	3477589	They opened a brand new retro gaming store, actually, right there on Sunrise.
3478009	3478429	Oh, really?
3478870	3482751	Basically, I think where Pure One was.
3484232	3484572	Oh.
3484592	3486393	And so they have, now it's Fire and Ice games.
3486453	3487534	And I noticed, though, on the...
3489204	3490745	I remember all this shit from when I was a kid.
3490765	3491886	I grew up in that neighborhood.
3491906	3494368	There's like a place called Fired Up or something like an e-gaming lounge over there.
3515266	3518427	There's Fire and Ice Games that's in Rockland.
3518687	3520167	I don't know if that's the same place.
3520807	3522528	No, that's a different place too.
3522568	3523168	Now that you mention it.
3523208	3524208	That's an arcade, isn't it?
3525209	3528389	No, that's also another franchise of this one.
3528429	3529630	So there are multiple stores.
3530030	3534271	But yeah, I saw Neo Geo on the window is what I was trying to get at.
3535471	3560558	um so i'm excited to see what they have in there but yeah it looks like like shelves of just like classic games and stuff yeah i do need to go in there and check it out uh i didn't get to last night but uh wait we shouldn't be giving him free advertising i gotta delete this out of the podcast we shouldn't be giving him they can pay they can pay us i just have to go check it out yes for myself we're not gonna say positive or negative anything yeah they may be good but they may not
3561398	3583573	it's just nice to see like other retro game stores because some of these especially like with the whole bubble with retro gaming and stuff like the prices of games have been like really high but I've been starting to see in like different places like there's a bookstore that has like used books that also sells like new in box NES games sometimes and they had like bad dudes the other day for like
3584312	3585393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3614612	3619673	I don't... We talked about it, but I still haven't seen it in person.
3619693	3620994	At least I don't think I have.
3622374	3628796	There was the Walmart in Roseville had the esports lounge that opened up inside of it.
3628896	3629356	Really?
3629376	3633437	Yeah, they had a whole esports lounge that...
3634857	3635618	OLR Goes to Roseville
3659252	3662775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3677887	3678908	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3700626	3701167	DarkSakura
3714880	3724789	Well, I have to swallow the bile back down just thinking of this again because of reasons.
3725690	3737001	But apparently a claim, as in that was the subsidiary that did Mortal Kombat back in the day, is back as an indie publisher.
3738663	3752062	and they want to do original IPs so and this is from Alex Yosef who is the the CEO of
3754926	3782094	saying that it's quote a relaunch revitalization of the Acclaim brand with completely new team some players have an association with Acclaim in the past but it's an all new team and that they're going to support indie developers and new IP and there's just stuff going on about this that just does not sit well with me there's a lot of spin in what you're reading too
3784845	3789431	the all new team all new IPs you know why?
3789912	3796160	because this has nothing to do with the acclaim in the 90s at least they're not launching an NFT yet, right?
3797221	3800286	why are they having a wrestler involved?
3801226	3817181	that's a whole other issue in this thing too because apparently Bobby had a call on his show tonight and apparently everything that guy has touched has not gone well either here's the reality of the situation the name Acclaim was literally in the discount bin at Walmart
3817822	3821004	Somebody bought it and said, y'all remember Acclaim, right?
3821044	3824406	Y'all ready to see what indie games we're going to make?
3824526	3825507	Let's go, let's go.
3825667	3829770	And of course, now everybody's going, fuck yeah, I want to see a new Double Dry again.
3829830	3833152	Or hell yeah, let's do a new NBA Jam because Acclaim gave us those.
3833252	3833833	Guess what?
3834093	3835754	Acclaim doesn't own that shit anymore.
3835954	3837255	They've all been... No, they do not.
3837435	3840976	They all got farmed out at the discount bin to other companies as well.
3841476	3844477	So, because we've seen new Double Dragon games come out from other companies.
3844537	3848098	We've seen, you know, NBA Jam, Arcade 1-Ups and stuff.
3848178	3850059	They're all with other companies now.
3850279	3854961	So this is the name and probably that same logo from the past.
3855101	3865324	Otherwise, this is, you know, this is very much a don't ask to see what's behind the curtain kind of thing because it's a pro wrestler thing.
3866440	3869242	and maybe a couple people that were involved with the claim before.
3869623	3873346	Maybe some people they're throwing money at to say, can you just say that you were involved here?
3874403	3880247	And they say that they've raised a good bit of money and that they'd be putting out quality games at a slower pace.
3883029	3891575	They've got some people involved, like Russell Binder has been involved in some of the game-based movies.
3893136	3896799	They've got a partnership with Mega Cat Studios.
3898280	3901982	I'm, I just, I, I, the whole thing doesn't sit well with me.
3902083	3906085	There's something going on behind, behind the curtain.
3906125	3906846	No, I feel you.
3907066	3907466	I feel you.
3907546	3913029	Like, I feel like whatever game they announce is going to be like, we've used AI to make this game.
3913049	3915471	Like I just, and again, I'm going off nothing but vibes.
3915591	3926118	This is vibes and speculation only, but I can't help but feel like it's going to be like, oh, the great AI adventure is coming out or just something that's just going to smell like garbage.
3927128	3928549	But hey, prove me wrong.
3928729	3930390	What IPs do they still have?
3930670	3933772	None.
3933872	3938915	That's why they have that lovely marketing thing of all new IPs and all new people.
3941536	3942737	I just, I can't.
3943177	3943757	Let me see.
3943978	3946819	They have some other partners.
3946879	3952763	They have Phil Toronto, partner at VaynerFund, and Eric Vogel with Jet Management.
3953503	3954524	People that gave us money.
3954864	3955204	Thank you.
3956383	3971988	Yeah, I'm just... They're saying, and this is another quote from here, Licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends, and seasoned veterans who have defined the intersection of video games and pop culture.
3972148	3973648	That's from their press release.
3974168	3977169	Yeah, I'll be waiting for that first trailer, and you know what?
3977329	3981430	I will be the first to shut the fuck up if they prove me wrong with that trailer, so you know what?
3981470	3982050	Prove me wrong.
3982211	3982511	Do it.
3983511	3983571	Um...
3985113	3988474	I have a feeling, though, that we're going to be proven right.
3989814	3990674	I have that feeling, too.
3991735	3997716	DJ Ranma S in chat says, To be fair, Double Dragon is back with the original license holder, Technos and Arc System Works.
3997736	3998276	Yes, I'm sorry.
3998316	4001977	I do not mean to taint the good name of Double Dragon, but I'm just using it as an example.
4002677	4006758	But yes, Double Dragon has nothing to do with this new acclaim, just to be absolutely clear.
4007659	4008319	They're also...
4009800	4011841	Can't wait to be blown away.
4033442	4047532	But I'm expecting a soft breeze Maybe we're just jaded Maybe we are But I feel that we have good reason to be Absolutely, if it walks like a duck and it talks like a duck, it's probably a duck It ain't a goose
4049491	4055693	Anyway, DarkTetsuya in chat says, yeah, I feel like someone else did something similar with a different company.
4055753	4056893	You are absolutely right.
4056953	4059994	This was bugging me for the last couple hours before the show started.
4060174	4065836	I know we had this exact same story within the last six months about another company.
4065896	4068617	And of course, I cannot remember who that company is in the moment.
4068697	4070118	I'm hoping somebody in chat remembers.
4070418	4073319	But there was another company that this literally just happened to.
4074139	4075179	Same thing.
4075639	4077680	They bought the name only and they don't have anything else.
4078922	4084748	So, Bobby did an interesting dive on his show and he was like, you know, the Epix trademark has been abandoned.
4084788	4088252	I was like, I want to buy the Epix Games trademark.
4088312	4089493	Are you fucking kidding?
4090354	4093237	I want Exidy, just because it's neat to say.
4093717	4094418	It is, it is.
4094818	4095699	Who wants Exidy?
4096099	4097221	Was it THQ?
4097361	4098021	It might have been.
4098802	4099523	It might have been.
4099983	4102946	Because I feel like it was one of those companies that got fire sold, but anyway.
4105756	4107817	And here's the lesson to learn out of this.
4108397	4111498	The name of the publisher is a name.
4112659	4115380	Don't let it carry any more weight than that.
4115940	4117961	Unless it's like A24 Films.
4118182	4125405	That's like the only one where maybe I'll be like, all right, yeah, you can sit up straight in your chair when you hear that because it's probably going to be a good movie.
4126505	4128867	But even then, it's always going to be a win.
4130487	4132828	Everyone does a stinky crap at some point in their life.
4132848	4133429	That's right.
4133549	4133969	That's right.
4135427	4137728	We are not immune to stinky crap syndrome.
4162301	4163822	Alright, let's move on.
4164362	4170306	Speaking of shitty things... I'm just... Okay, keep going.
4170386	4174568	I'm just... We're gonna sit here and wait for that trailer.
4174848	4176189	And I'm gonna... You know what?
4176329	4177270	Use that spite...
4178174	4186198	that y'all have listening to us be, you know, kind of being very lukewarm on this tea, you know, use that spite to really blow us away with the trailer.
4186698	4190340	And I will be the first one to say, wow, did I misfire on this or what?
4190941	4194843	But I'm just sitting here going, we've been doing this a very long time.
4196563	4198324	And we were pretty good at spotting ducks.
4200365	4202807	We're very good at duck hunt 23 years later.
4203867	4207069	Did you know that the second controller could be used to control the duck?
4211314	4236863	Loki, speaking of shitty things happening at companies yes and continuing on with the trend of laying off workers at studios in the game industry Sony is back with more cancellations and more layoffs so they apparently sent out notice to Visual Arts Group which was based out of San Diego that their last day
4237972	4239373	at Sony would be March 7th.
4240134	4249821	And the team had done some internal art and technical support for first-party PlayStation CEO games and worked on The Last of Us Part 1 and 2 remasters.
4250661	4253523	Of course, Sony didn't make any comment about it.
4253643	4254424	They said, you know,
4255390	4266137	The former PSVA project manager, Abby Lemaster, said it was tough waking up to messages that my friends and former co-workers were laid off this morning.
4266177	4276363	The layoffs today hit hard and they let go developers with decades of subject matter expertise, talent that will be extraordinarily difficult to recoup.
4277479	4279360	We've heard that many, many times.
4279820	4285823	This industry can be unpredictable, but the skill and experience and passion of the people I worked with are undeniable.
4286524	4292067	And then along with that, we've got word that there's more live service cancellations.
4292147	4297089	We talked about the God of War one that was being worked on at Bluepoint Games.
4298370	4301492	Also, they apparently...
4303424	4303924	Thanks for watching!
4318204	4324486	for example, to avoid too high peak resource on development teams because the cost can be sticky.
4324566	4333369	So essentially that they're looking to outsource to other cheaper teams and not have a lot of staff on hand as the need for those staff fluxes.
4333869	4335150	It's an excuse, whatever.
4335190	4344773	They're making boatloads of money and they need to lay people off to keep up the illusion of infinite growth because that's what we do.
4349904	4350425	That's annoying.
4351325	4351626	Yeah.
4352286	4357171	That's... It's just... It's hard to be a fan of this industry sometimes.
4358192	4358893	It really is.
4359433	4362456	Like... Anyway.
4363057	4363858	That's all I got to say.
4364979	4365059	Um...
4367759	4368860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4389332	4414237	why it's like you wouldn't they don't know what they're doing why is this happening oh because the stats that aren't true oh you know we want to bully you into becoming a state even though you are a completely sovereign it's just y'all i'm so tired we need more tariffs what are tariffs uh yeah what are tariffs do those what are those they're not taxes right no okay good things that give money right there's the things that trade with other countries
4414457	4415158	So here's the thing.
4415178	4418023	I'm sure some of you love to roll your eyes when we talk about politics.
4418063	4419645	But guess what, Mimi?
4420406	4422069	It affects gaming.
4422409	4424312	And here's the proof in the pudding.
4424913	4428899	Because now we're hearing about how tariffs may impact
4429560	4432861	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4449824	4451986	They all done told you, but now the-
4466022	4478568	So, an analyst by the name of Matt Piscitella, who works for Sakana, and I'm actually going to... I'm not going to shade this guy because it's not a news post coming from X. It's a news post coming from Blue Sky.
4478668	4479688	And I'm going to say, you know what?
4479788	4482590	I appreciate an analyst who realizes that...
4483470	4485291	You need to get the fuck off of X, right?
4485411	4489854	So I'm going to be very kind to this individual tonight.
4491234	4496817	But it basically goes on to say, echo the things that Deft was telling us a while ago.
4497358	4504642	A very small piece of all this, but it wouldn't surprise me to see physical games that would be subject to tariffs simply not get made.
4505478	4508401	with publishers moving to an all-digital strategy.
4508842	4509422	What a mess.
4509482	4512265	And that's something that Matt wrote over on Blue Sky.
4512345	4520734	And that was in response to a post by another individual named Daniel that said, 20% tariff impacts video game consoles.
4521034	4523457	25% tariff on Mexico impacts physical video games.
4523877	4526280	China is where most hardware continues to be manufactured.
4526340	4527842	Same for Mexico with discs.
4528442	4537524	and so, yeah, you know, if these dumb dippy tariffs end up happening, that's probably going to be the nail in the coffin of the physical disc industry.
4538464	4546026	Now, I mean, you know, there will always be some made, you know, like a limited run type of thing, a criterion type of thing and all this stuff.
4546407	4558150	So, you know, when I say it's dead, I don't mean like completely absent, but I mean most major publishers will probably move away from making disc games wherever they possibly can.
4560431	4561832	And you can thank the tariffs for that.
4564533	4565113	And why?
4565133	4565193	Why?
4566636	4567757	Fentanyl or something?
4568017	4569958	Even though we send them all these guns?
4571519	4571939	Freedom?
4574280	4575261	Make it make sense!
4576081	4582745	Sorry, everyone, people who voted for that thing, you did this.
4583145	4583685	Fuck you.
4583986	4588228	I don't feel sorry for any of you who have regret because fuck you.
4588968	4591870	We told you this shit was gonna happen and did you listen to us?
4592030	4592590	Fuck no.
4594271	4595412	I'm a little bit worked up, sorry.
4596167	4598649	No, I get it because these are just- Actually, I'm not sorry.
4598749	4599810	I'm allowed to be angry.
4600171	4603914	These are the same people- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck all of them.
4604334	4608298	These are the same people that will go on social media and say, but my video games.
4608578	4609699	Well, guess what?
4610600	4613282	Well, I don't give a shit about what you think about your video games.
4613342	4615264	I give a shit about what we think about our video games.
4615284	4618687	I'm just telling you, the call is coming from inside the house, y'all.
4622777	4627461	And Phil of Nine says, I can't stop thinking about the government workers who inevitably voted for him and lost their jobs.
4628061	4632144	I don't feel sorry for them, but I do feel sorry for the rest of us who are suffering for their absence.
4633765	4639870	Because how many more plane crashes have we had since the dissolution within the aeronautics industry?
4640250	4642452	Or in the oversight in the government?
4643913	4647095	Firing essential nuclear monitors?
4649697	4651679	Doing it all by fucking AI?
4656298	4661411	I do not feel bad for anyone who has voter regret over that creature.
4662222	4667506	It is the grandest example of – and we see this in the gaming industry all the time, right?
4667867	4673031	That the people in the boardroom don't know what the fuck is actually happening on the ground floor.
4673531	4681778	Like this is like literally like a shining star in the sky example of all of that that unfortunately we're all suffering the consequences of.
4681858	4687623	But you can actually see this play out in real time on CNN or your favorite news channel of choice at any time.
4688343	4691948	is the people in the boardroom have no fucking idea what the rest of the company is doing.
4692308	4699818	And you can see that their brash decisions made from Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoints have a real impact on everything downstream.
4700478	4702701	And it's mind-blowing.
4703602	4704262	Mind-blowing.
4704663	4709485	And then, DarkSakura, you bring up an excellent point that's going to transition very kindly into our next story.
4710085	4717189	Now we're talking about bringing in AI into these things where it's like, AI's not ready!
4718209	4719550	Did we not see
4720990	4734673	We could have an entire chat about the whole, like, where is... Look, and I'm not shitting on AI in every single circumstance because, like, the oldest video games use what I would call AI in how you do computer opponents.
4734753	4736713	There's different varieties of it.
4736733	4738473	You have assistive AI.
4739294	4747035	You have, like you were saying, you have your AI in games that control events, which has existed for a while.
4747893	4751876	What it comes down to is that AI is a tool, not a replacement.
4752256	4755579	And all of the times, all of the times- There's no true intelligence yet.
4755659	4758141	We've seen people try to use AI as a replacement.
4758241	4759982	It backfires spectacularly.
4760082	4765266	And I mean that to mean AI as a replacement for making decisions, which is what we're hearing about in this situation.
4765826	4771211	and just a brilliant example of AI is just not fucking ready.
4771531	4774093	And you see this everywhere in the real world.
4774273	4782079	All of these companies are fighting to piss on each other to make sure they are the first to implement AI because heaven forbid they fall behind in this race.
4782339	4785942	Have you all stopped to consider that maybe it's not time to implement AI yet?
4786222	4787283	Because AI isn't right.
4787764	4788144	A lot.
4788544	4789085	It's not right.
4789325	4791827	It's not really AI anyway.
4791967	4793088	It's not intelligent.
4794029	4794429	That's true.
4794509	4795509	It cannot think.
4796250	4798151	It's a glorified fucking database.
4819884	4821865	and I'm changing the names to protect the incident.
4821945	4827467	It said, Susan once dated so-and-so and it gave them the confidence to come out of the closet.
4828167	4832389	This person had been posting memes and they just got, they caught a fucking stray.
4833029	4836770	Like this person didn't come out of the closet, but AI tried to out them.
4837971	4846454	I'm using it a completely ludicrous scenario, but I use it to say like, this isn't ready for
4847759	4848599	and DarkSakura.com.
4878192	4880634	I can't stand it.
4881394	4883035	And it's happening everywhere.
4883516	4895363	In some places, like maybe like a Photoshop tool or something or an internally made machine learning algorithm to help upscale games from 4K to 8K.
4895764	4902628	Sure, we can handle that because that's been done in this controlled environment that's meant to do one or two specific tasks.
4903049	4903429	Fine.
4904011	4906233	or like on-device photo enhancement.
4906873	4907053	Sure.
4907073	4910356	Which is basically Samsung's entire model for their photos right now.
4910896	4913739	But it's just, do we need it?
4913819	4915620	And like literally, you go into your email.
4915880	4917121	Here's your AI summary.
4917141	4917902	You go into the news.
4917962	4919243	Here's your AI summary.
4919443	4920564	You go into a Google search.
4920624	4921865	Here's your AI summary.
4922165	4925307	Take your AI summary and shove it up your pee hole.
4925708	4926769	I don't want it.
4933049	4942392	Bobby Blackwell in chat says, I love that when I went to a software conference that was trying to tell us what we needed to implement AI for our clients, the testing of the AI has a threshold.
4943292	4944212	90% of our tests pass.
4944513	4948554	That's ready for production, which means the AI gives the wrong result 10% of the time.
4949554	4950694	That's too big of a threshold.
4954396	4955596	That's a big problem.
4957765	4965330	And I mean, alright, the Lincoln Lee, we know it's not going away, but it's not quite ready for prime time.
4965350	4966991	That's exactly it.
4967171	4968612	It's a half-baked potato.
4969572	4970673	It needs work.
4971093	4972254	It's a half-baked steak.
4972434	4975156	It might still have salmonella, but most of them are okay.
4977437	4978377	And I honestly, I'm...
4979645	4982847	I'm not mad at the whole summary thing.
4983608	4992954	It can be kind of cool, especially for people who have very busy jobs and need to get the information at a glance.
4993514	4995876	I don't have a problem with that.
4996796	4999498	And it doesn't work all the time, just like with your example.
4999718	5004822	But I think that if they see something as important enough, they'll go in and actually read the thing.
5006162	5007243	I'm giving people too much credit.
5007283	5007643	Never mind.
5007663	5008424	Yeah.
5009828	5010169	Hmm.
5037938	5058821	I like that the same with Apple the same with I think Google service does it I don't want to give them credit because I'm really upset with Google but there's just too much out there and I mean and you can flat out go on to chat GTP
5059764	5066914	and say, I need a Python code that calculates this, this, this, and this, and it will generate a Python code that won't work.
5068036	5072602	But still... Here's... Go ahead.
5073984	5074325	It's just...
5076187	5079829	I could sit and pretend I can fully... I'm a beginner at Python.
5080530	5089595	But I could sit and probably figure out with what I know and have ChatGTP write the models for me and make something that looks competent.
5090315	5093397	But I only did 3% of the work.
5095078	5099620	And that wouldn't be fair to the people who actually know Python and program in it.
5100441	5100661	So...
5101448	5106430	I want to respond to this comment in chat because I want to use it to illustrate where I think the AI system is broken right now.
5106771	5113414	And it's the Lincoln Lee in chat says, I like I can ask it to code a website for me and it will do it in five minutes.
5113574	5114374	Here's my question.
5115234	5118316	Are you taking what is being produced and are you validating it?
5118736	5122837	or customizing it to fit your needs based on whatever it is you're asking it to do?
5123357	5128059	Are you using that to maybe jumpstart what it is you want to do because whatever?
5128659	5130579	I actually don't have a problem with that.
5130719	5135481	What I have a problem with is that there are so many companies out there right now
5136221	5147088	that would say, I want to code the website and do it in five minutes and then immediately publish that website because they fired the person that would do the validation check or do the middleman check or it's cost too many hours or things like that.
5147548	5150030	To me, what you're doing there... That's different.
5150050	5151270	That's assistive AI.
5151371	5151871	Exactly.
5151951	5154793	Because to me, that's like Google 2.0.
5155333	5160196	And I think eventually that's where AI is going to end up is it's like, jumpstart me this, but...
5161397	5164259	What would you do if AI wasn't a thing and you had to code a website?
5164699	5171764	You would probably Google, show me what website looks like, and you'd probably try to find a pretty good Google search and try to make your own.
5171784	5173025	Or use Squarespace or something.
5173706	5175347	Yeah, which is fine too.
5176107	5179310	But to me, that's the big disconnect right now.
5179730	5180771	They're like, it can't go wrong.
5181171	5181371	It's logic.
5199002	5200643	Of course it's going to do it right.
5201104	5205827	90% of the time is enough until you find that bug that's going to fucking break your game for that 10%.
5206007	5212932	And melt down your computer and your NES system, this whole limited run game.
5213032	5214953	Or think of bigger systems.
5215313	5216114	Security breaches.
5217175	5220077	Find the exploit built that the AI fucking missed.
5220597	5222679	And one last thing.
5223359	5227422	That example that I gave about the Python thing, I can get away with that where I work.
5228550	5229070	DarkSakura
5259625	5271557	Yeah, so there is a company called WeLevel and they have raised $5.7 million to, as they say, revolutionize procedural game development.
5272018	5273139	And you know what they want to do?
5275441	5275681	AI.
5277363	5277623	They...
5280257	5285960	They are, basically, the investment company behind them is BitCraft Ventures.
5286881	5294205	But they want to expand innovative AI tools to streamline game development and, quote, create dynamic personalized gameplay.
5294665	5299148	This is coming from Christian Heimau, who is the CEO of WeLevel.
5301069	5307813	They have actually already started, they began their project development in 2021 using in-house generative models.
5308633	5310895	Okay, that part I'm okay with.
5311275	5313216	In-house generative models.
5313696	5316838	If it all was made in-house, I'm cool with that.
5317419	5319420	But, here we go.
5320121	5329067	They have brought in more investors, including one of the board members at Roblox, the co-founder of Shopify.
5330593	5357684	Crunchyroll people I mean Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell just a bunch of people in there and they're wanting as they say they want to build games driven by passion not monetization and so they want to use AI to streamline their production so they can put more focus on creativity but at the same time what are they taking away
5358670	5360931	What's going to happen to the quality, like we were saying before?
5360971	5365292	What's going to happen to the people who are skilled in this sort of labor?
5366733	5376276	How is AI going to be able to translate the thought of a creative human being and make it come out the way they want?
5376336	5378477	I keep thinking of that damn Coca-Cola commercial.
5379897	5381438	You remember that junk heap?
5382658	5386981	Oh yeah, the one for Winter that just looked really, yeah, wonky.
5387181	5388862	I just keep seeing that in my head.
5389822	5390403	No, I get it.
5390843	5392564	And, you know, again, go ahead.
5393885	5402470	Well, Heimerl is saying, and this is a quote, having used AI in my former companies, I recognize the potential it has to empower small, passionate teams to produce games.
5404511	5409894	And, but like, here's where I am with this, is that if it's all in-house trained,
5412048	5422071	I'm still kind of of two minds about it because what's going to happen to these talented people now that they're going to miss out on because they have a database to build their tool?
5425172	5425472	You know?
5426712	5426973	Yeah.
5427213	5432894	I mean, like, you know, again, like we're not going to get to this world of 8K games.
5433074	5441457	And so, you know, if you think it takes a long time to make a video game now, I understand like AI is inevitable in order to cut some corners to make that happen and having those tools.
5442037	5444999	When it's internally developed stuff, you know, yeah.
5445400	5456788	And I think inevitably you have more people, you have more jobs that are going to kind of shift to being able to be specialists that work with these tools in order to get those types of things done faster.
5456828	5458429	I think inevitably that's kind of what happens.
5458850	5465815	But again, the more you start to replace, the more it's going to show and it always shows.
5466923	5470905	Here's where I start getting that feeling.
5471445	5472605	That terrible feeling.
5473366	5475727	And this is a quote from the press release.
5477127	5486031	Beyond the initial project, the team has plans for expansive user-generated content and aspirations to expand into other genres and settings.
5486071	5487531	Right now they're working on a sandbox game.
5488132	5489872	And they're going to be at GDC 2025.
5491573	5496115	It's the part where they're saying plans to use user-generated content.
5497150	5510852	which means it's going to be probably built into whatever agreement to play the game that your content that you create in game or in universe is fair game for them to use.
5513033	5525255	Why do you think I left DeviantArt over that years ago because they were saying that we can use your stuff and sell it and now they're full on have their AI models in there.
5526147	5528192	trained off of the user's data.
5530016	5533284	And this is where I really, really, really draw the line.
5536351	5543973	I think Bobby Blackwolf has a very interesting sort of analogy here that I think for me sums it up as well.
5544693	5549494	Saying, a few decades ago, people's appliances like refrigerators and washing machines lasted for decades.
5550034	5553355	Then we stopped having humans build them and instead used robots to build them.
5553535	5555175	Now you're lucky if they last five years.
5555475	5557296	But that fridge was built faster and cheaper.
5559516	5561677	The ice machine in my fridge broke in less than a year.
5566943	5567423	We'll see.
5567603	5568504	We'll see what develops.
5568924	5570866	It's still an emerging thing.
5570906	5574048	But that's, again, going back to what my point really is in this.
5574268	5575129	It's emerging.
5575469	5579732	So stop trying to shove it in everything before it's finished.
5579992	5580713	It's not finished.
5581533	5583995	For a lot of things that they're trying to make us believe it is.
5585516	5587638	Don't... Yeah, they... It's...
5589195	5607267	people want to be the first so badly and they want to be right so badly that they'll take what they think is a reasonable risk and get shit in, shit out that's how it is I
5612085	5613867	My feelings on this are very complicated.
5613927	5621355	And right now I am having just a touch of emotional blindness that I can't really say how I feel about it.
5621555	5623758	I just know that I feel kind of sick about it.
5623778	5626861	All right, well, let's move on anyway for time.
5626901	5628783	So let's move on to our next story.
5628863	5629945	So Loki, what do you have for us?
5631499	5637082	Alright, so let's talk about a beta program coming to the PlayStation.
5638663	5651550	Sounds like kind of like what we have with Microsoft and the Xbox Insider program, but this is going to be something that they're rolling out to kind of consolidate all the different beta programs that they've had across the Sony and PlayStation apps.
5652170	5672195	So this brand new beta program that they announced at the PlayStation Initiative on March 4th is a new program planned to be Sony's main consolidated way to allow interested PlayStation fans to test out brand new PlayStation 5 features, the PlayStation app updates, and even early game beta tests.
5673115	5682020	and along with that, you know, like I said, they're just consolidating everything instead of having to sign up for individual beta programs.
5682120	5689823	It's just all going to be under one umbrella and not really sure what that means going forward.
5691852	5710127	as far as what things they may be testing but it's all brand new so I guess I guess we'll see a lot of stuff leak out at some point because even though they have you agree to NDAs and stuff oh yeah that always works that always works yep you gonna sign up for it?
5711161	5711361	No.
5711561	5712622	I don't have a PlayStation.
5712862	5713643	Oh, I thought you did.
5713763	5714484	I thought you did by now.
5714644	5715304	No, I have a PlayStation 4.
5715404	5716125	Oh, okay.
5716245	5720008	I have a PlayStation 5, but I don't... I mean, I don't know.
5720028	5722230	I don't get excited about a lot of the interface betas.
5722270	5726313	Maybe there's something coming that I really feel like I need to be on the front lines of, sure, but I don't know.
5726353	5728014	I haven't seen it yet, so...
5731147	5732688	All right.
5733029	5737432	Let's talk about the Diablo 4 Battle Pass, because I do love to talk about Diablo.
5738353	5744819	But I also recognize that the Battle Pass is kind of not necessary.
5744999	5747561	It really is just like a money grab for cosmetics.
5750203	5759394	I enjoy and I will oftentimes get them because I like to show that stuff off, but I find that there's a very limited audience to be able to show it off to.
5759434	5766302	It's not like Dead by Daylight where you're constantly showing off your cosmetics and matches that you're going into and things like that.
5766903	5768805	Me showing off my cosmetics and matches, sir.
5768965	5775189	Diablo 4, you're sometimes grouped with people, but party content is not super common, actually.
5775850	5786398	Anyway, it was an interesting comment made recently by Rod Ferguson, the head of Diablo 4, talking about that Blizzard might be actually moving away from the Battle Pass system.
5786738	5787578	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5808368	5808808	and DarkSakura.
5836548	5839330	I think what we're going to be introducing some interesting things.
5839990	5853539	Now, in related comments, not in the same breath here, but he's also spoken in recent times about Call of Duty's map battle passes where you can kind of prioritize what it is you actually want to unlock within the system.
5854199	5856361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5874705	5875225	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5902922	5909968	Alright, DarkSakura, you were texting me about this one before the show and I was like, oh, this is... I was.
5910048	5911509	Here we go, here we go.
5911529	5913230	I have other emotions.
5914271	5923799	So, and I do have to give credit to one of my favorite DBD YouTubers, MintSkull, for making a video on this that explains it very well.
5924880	5928303	But YouTube is changing their mid-roll ad placement.
5929289	5930809	and not necessarily for the better.
5931510	5935631	Like on paper to the viewer, it sounds pretty good.
5937191	5951855	You know, you can still manually place ad breaks, but they're now trying to determine with this automatic detection is if the placement is going to be intrusive upon the, or interruptive on the experience.
5953092	5953773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5971071	5983500	and they are looking for natural breakpoints but the thing is is that there are different creators out there who try to do I like how he phrased it the ADHD editing
5984682	6004700	where they talk fast there's no space in between um you know which honestly I don't like because I like for people to breathe in between their words and speak at a pace that's understandable I hate when people are just like and we do this we do that we do this we do that drives me nuts I like to be able to understand what I'm listening to going back to this though
6006593	6022942	It still gets in the way of portraying a lot of information a short amount of time if they're forcing these ads in and then calling them interruptive.
6023662	6029726	You're going to have to program in moments of silence into your dialogue or your script.
6031038	6031078	Um...
6056238	6063641	Now, for people who deliver their stuff at a pace usually for a different audience or for, you know, maybe...
6065091	6071957	I'm more, what's the word I'm thinking of, like documentary or slower style, you know, for a different audience.
6072017	6081885	That may not affect them, but there are a lot of people out there who their audience wants that fast pace, no break in flow of information.
6082826	6087730	And this will completely shoot them in the wallet.
6091696	6098830	I just think these mid-roll ads, especially when, like, it's one thing if the user chooses where to put them in.
6098870	6100474	It's for videos eight minutes or longer.
6100814	6100955	Okay.
6102168	6122892	I think it's one thing if you let the user or the creator kind of choose where to put this stuff, but I think when you force it on it and you're using these, you know, I hate to go back here, but AI, not quite ready for prime time, but we're going to use it anyway to serve up these ads, you know, and this whole thing, and you're not letting people choose where to put it in, then you're going to be asking yourself, why are more people using Adblock on YouTube?
6123492	6126673	Why are these Adblock things consistently trying to block our ads on YouTube?
6126773	6126953	Like,
6129188	6130869	You know the answer to why.
6130909	6139475	Because you're putting in so many of these mineral ads in places that don't make sense that people are just going to find any way they can around it.
6141136	6144538	Right now, at least on a computer, it's very easy to do ad blocking at YouTube.
6144878	6146739	It's the devices.
6147540	6156166	This is probably why YouTube would rather that I watch videos on my Samsung TV or on my PlayStation 5 because I can't use ad blocks on those systems.
6158027	6158187	So.
6161761	6163862	Anyway, it's definitely there.
6164022	6166744	There are pluses and minuses to this.
6167124	6167964	And I mean, and right.
6169165	6172827	Ranma is absolutely right that some of that ad revenue goes to VOG.
6174047	6178810	We have content up there that's longer than eight minutes that is subject to pre-roll ads.
6179670	6179871	Yeah.
6180131	6183232	And we give information pretty fast paced.
6183272	6184273	I like to think for us.
6185683	6191729	Yeah, and sorry, just to echo what Bobby's saying to correct the Lincoln Lee.
6192090	6194252	No, we can't choose to not have ads on VOG.
6194332	6202380	What we do, we roll two minutes intentionally when there's no live content airing so that it dumps the pre-rolls for, I think, 40 minutes.
6202821	6206765	But once that's done, we are forced by Twitch to use pre-roll ads.
6206805	6207525	But you'll notice...
6208326	6214349	Unlike a lot of other streamers on here, and I'm not saying people got to have their money and earn their living and do that.
6214689	6216029	We're hobbyist podcasters.
6216429	6218430	I'm not dumping mid-roll ads during the show on you.
6218530	6220691	I could, but we're not.
6221171	6223312	And that's just how we've chosen to do it.
6223672	6226774	Could we make more money if we were to do some mid-roll ads?
6227154	6229675	Probably, but honestly, it's not enough.
6229695	6230575	That's not what we're there for.
6230635	6232576	And it's not enough to have that conversation.
6232696	6233436	It's pennies.
6233997	6234557	Pennies.
6236285	6238327	I don't mean pennies every time I push the button.
6238347	6240028	I mean pennies over the course of a month.
6240528	6241068	It's not worth it.
6241169	6241729	Oh, yeah.
6241949	6242950	It's minor.
6243130	6247493	I mean, I know it's not the same thing, but I was just looking at my Twitch ad revenue.
6248353	6251015	You want to know how much I made for a really solid month?
6251035	6251015	$4.
6251295	6251395	Yep.
6255774	6257917	Oh yeah, we're not partner and that's probably the key there.
6257977	6260960	I didn't even realize partners could choose not to run ads.
6261440	6262441	So that's interesting.
6262602	6266286	And I don't care about being partner on YouTube.
6267687	6268248	Oh no.
6268628	6269649	And even on Twitch.
6269669	6270851	Why would we want to?
6271499	6273660	I've kind of accepted on Twitch... That's a lot of work.
6274360	6278342	And I've accepted on Twitch it's probably not going to happen, and I'm okay with it.
6278522	6280903	Like, you know, this is a fun thing.
6280943	6281764	This isn't my career.
6283004	6283685	And I'm okay with that.
6283965	6291228	Maybe... I wouldn't mind being a Twitch partner someday, but I'm not, like, heartbroken that I'm not.
6292128	6295550	I do what... We do this because we love doing this.
6296611	6297071	This is...
6298231	6303953	We have a Guinness World Record for doing something we fucking love.
6305433	6307074	If we're happy, why push it?
6308815	6309215	It's funny.
6309535	6311716	Lincoln Lee in chat says, why wouldn't you want to be partner?
6313796	6319638	Actually, Bobby and I used to get asked this question a lot at certain conferences, which is, why aren't you monetizing more?
6319898	6322919	And it was one of those things where it was like, we don't want to.
6324080	6326801	I think when you start to monetize...
6327915	6336159	There's a certain element of you are buying a product from me and therefore I feel an onus to deliver on said product.
6336519	6339180	And some people would try to talk me out of that.
6339481	6347224	But again, I just took two weeks off because I wanted to go party with nerds in the Gulf of Mexico on a boat.
6349525	6354588	Do you think that if I was a partner, I probably wouldn't be able to do that.
6355208	6358074	because it would directly affect my well-being and all that stuff.
6358134	6360177	It would start becoming a job at that point.
6360278	6360498	Yeah.
6361781	6366409	I mean... So... It's not that less viewers are better.
6366610	6367611	I think that we have...
6368999	6370420	Good quality viewers.
6370500	6372142	We have... Or listeners, even.
6372882	6376625	We... We have... We've made so many friends this way.
6376865	6377145	Oh, yeah.
6377386	6383971	And I've gone out of state and had people invite me to DDR tournaments because they listened to this show.
6384011	6385812	And we had a great time hanging out.
6386593	6387614	I've... It's...
6390266	6392447	Yes, you're a quality viewer, Shadow.
6394148	6396830	Shadow is one of my DBD friends and one of my mods.
6399051	6402573	But I like it this way.
6403013	6410818	I feel like we have more meaningful interactions rather than just a bunch of strange conversation.
6411138	6414080	I like to have the interaction.
6414720	6415421	That's the thing.
6415441	6416001	And we have
6416812	6434543	a good number of people that we can regularly interact with and on top of that we've got people all over the world who listen to the podcast so you may see small number for the Twitch viewing but we have more people out there who just
6436362	6439044	aren't able to come in at 6 o'clock p.m.
6439124	6445990	on a Sunday night Pacific time because they are 10 hours ahead of us or it's tomorrow already somewhere.
6449312	6454917	We're not doing this as a media production per se, like what you're saying, you're a media production person.
6455497	6461241	We do this because it's a hobby and we love it and we've just refined our hobby over the last 22 years.
6463277	6465178	And also the Lincoln Lee says, OK, my bad.
6465238	6465978	There's nothing.
6466018	6466878	There's no my bad.
6467198	6467658	It's fine.
6467878	6468818	Like we get out.
6468898	6470639	We actually people who don't understand.
6470659	6473419	We get this question a lot and we haven't talked about it in a while.
6473479	6474479	It's like totally fine.
6474559	6480041	And I realize it's a little weird because you hear so much in the media about.
6480601	6486442	Could I tell you know, if we if I were to open up the mailbag and tell you how many spam mails we get.
6487182	6488983	Make money off your podcast.
6489063	6490344	Monetize your podcast.
6490384	6491504	Monetize your YouTube.
6491544	6492305	Monetize this one.
6492325	6494086	How about you bite my podcaster butt?
6494206	6509354	And I'm just like, money, I know it is a very weird thing to say in 2025 or that I'm coming from some weird holier-than-thou kind of place, and I promise it's not, but it's like money really isn't everything sometimes.
6510816	6513720	Yeah, I think in this case it would kind of taint.
6514401	6519948	I mean, it'd be nice, I think, to have a little bit, you know, like maybe get new equipment, but that's a different story.
6519968	6521190	That's why I have my own channel.
6521510	6521691	Yeah.
6521991	6522211	Right?
6522592	6522772	Yeah.
6522812	6525155	So I could pay for TwitchCon and buy new equipment at the end.
6525536	6525736	And I'm
6526636	6531998	I'm not opposed to more viewers, but it is also a vicious cycle of to get partner, you have to have the viewers.
6532478	6534019	To get the viewers, you have to have partner.
6534199	6536540	And of course, we're going to try to promote.
6536580	6539261	This is why I try to do things at different conventions.
6539401	6540942	And we've done stuff locally.
6541102	6544403	And of course, we always say at the end of the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
6544523	6548224	We try to do our social media things and try to get the words out different ways.
6548364	6548564	But...
6550265	6556467	You know, this market of video game podcasts is also so saturated at this point.
6556767	6569712	You have to remember, when we started doing this as a live 365 show in 2002, and then especially when Apple iTunes rolled out podcasting in 2006, you know, being in the game then, there was so little competition.
6569732	6571712	We had a ton of people listening to us at the time.
6572253	6578555	But over time, now there's... And especially a lot of people that have more name recognition than, you know...
6579255	6605283	Lil' Ol' Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki and it's it's hard and it's not my job hey we're in a video game or two so we're happy yeah that's true I love those cameos yeah yeah I think they were very well done um but but going going back to it it's it's not my job I don't want it to be my job because I'd hate it if it was my job yeah
6606343	6606603	All right.
6606963	6608524	I do want to keep things moving, though.
6608765	6610826	And no, no, it was a good tangent.
6610866	6611486	We need to talk about it.
6611646	6618791	I do want to keep things moving, though, and get to a segment that we do here every week on the show and talk a little bit about the classic game of the week.
6629699	6636985	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6637445	6640047	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
6642088	6645191	And DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
6646472	6651456	Well, remember I'm doing a special thing this particular week.
6651556	6654498	Sorry, and some of the noise is getting through too, sorry.
6655707	6661188	Every month, once a month, I have a special theme for the year, and I do a special game.
6661729	6672051	And this year's themes, as long as I can keep finding shit for it, are console games that became arcade games, or were ported as an arcade game.
6673191	6675572	And I have chosen Thunder Force AC.
6676192	6677992	And you can all thank Dan for this one.
6678713	6679573	My delightful spouse.
6680513	6684356	It is a horizontal space shooter from Sega and Technosoft.
6685556	6689979	Thunder Force 3 came out on the Sega Genesis, aka Mega Drive everywhere else.
6690720	6696704	And the game was so well received that they brought it out in the arcades under Thunder Force AC.
6697244	6700026	It was brought out to Sega System C2 hardware.
6700566	6705090	And it is almost graphically identical to the Mega Drive version.
6705230	6707611	It has a few differences on there.
6707951	6709653	Some upgrades here and there.
6710833	6713716	It's pretty much a retool of Thunder Force 3.
6713796	6718961	It borrows some enemies and stages from Thunder Force 2 and adds original content.
6720823	6723746	And good luck finding the JAMA board, by the way.
6723806	6726688	But you want to know the funny thing about this is that this was...
6727788	6750782	a Genesis port that went to arcade that was then reported to the Super Famicom or Super Nintendo as Thunder Spirits in 1992 and there is a Sega Saturn port of AC that is included on the Thunder Force Gold Pack 2 which I own a copy of um
6751943	6758311	There's also a Switch port that came out May 2020 with the Sega Ages release.
6760574	6762796	Rynek appears as one of the unlockable ships.
6763818	6767903	And it has the Thunder Sword variant and the mass production model sticks.
6767983	6770886	So you get some bonuses for the Sega Ages release.
6772067	6782038	and it's I mean the Thunder Force games are so good like the first the first one I don't think was very fun second one is like
6783547	6788732	Thunder Force 1 with Thunder Force 2-ish.
6789713	6792476	So, yeah.
6792616	6795779	It was pretty interesting.
6796560	6798182	And Link and Lee, don't worry about arguing.
6798242	6798882	We argue all the time.
6799483	6804128	But I would say that the Super Nintendo version of this...
6806061	6820787	you can tell it's a port it's definitely a little bit odd but I mean the music in it is of course fantastic because Thunder Force music is just freaking amazing I think that it's
6822188	6847408	probably one of the best shooters out there and if you can find it on any system be it Genesis or find the arcade version good luck finding a JAMMA board for sale though I'm just going to say that they are pretty freaking rare now but even the SNES one is really good so go play it it's worthwhile if you find one in the wild in an arcade please take a picture and tell me because I would love to see it
6849500	6851663	God, do you think any of them actually work anymore?
6851683	6854005	That'd be wild.
6854185	6859271	No, I keep looking for one at California Extreme.
6859291	6860413	I don't think I've seen one yet.
6860513	6865258	I usually get distracted because I'll find a baby Pac-Man and go, oh my God, a baby Pac-Man.
6866239	6870064	Yeah, SJ100Matt says, I've only seen it on MAME cabinets.
6872608	6874109	I know exactly what Bobby's thinking.
6874149	6877452	He's going to run to the Black Wolf Manor basement and pull it up.
6878013	6880675	We mean like one of these actual machines out in the wild.
6880735	6887542	I want to see a real native Sega published
6889932	6917784	it's real to me Bobby says it's real to me we've got it on our Ultracade and we actually do have we have the Genesis one we have the Super Famicom one and we have the Saturn release so Thunder Force games though like 3 and up are just fucking good there was Lightning Force as well which is another Thunder Force port but yeah good games
6919694	6924937	Bobby went back and did Purirura after I did that for Classic Game.
6925037	6925497	Oh, I know.
6925757	6926037	I know.
6926137	6926378	Yeah.
6926498	6927958	No, it's a fucking weird ass game.
6928178	6928439	Yeah.
6928999	6929459	Good times.
6929619	6929939	All right.
6931700	6933001	Let's move on.
6933081	6936723	We just have a few more things to cover before we wrap up the show for tonight.
6937643	6943786	But we want to get to some rapid fire news and talk about a few other headlines that are happening around the industry.
6944287	6945507	Loki, you still there?
6946508	6948009	We haven't heard from you in a minute.
6948049	6948449	Oh, good.
6950049	6951530	He's just listening to us rant.
6952571	6957574	And for the record, that mail went down and we don't have anything, so let's just forget about it.
6958335	6958735	That's fine.
6958835	6960616	I actually scrubbed the mailbag earlier.
6960636	6963158	It was full of spam and all that crap.
6963878	6969882	Anyway, and I do want to point out for the live listeners, the Lincoln Lee had a comment in chat that said, this is a great show, by the way.
6969922	6970203	Thank you.
6970543	6971744	Sorry I argued so much.
6971804	6974425	To which Jamie had the perfect response, saying, we argue all the time.
6974445	6974986	That's what we do.
6975446	6977087	Especially having worked together for 23 years.
6978368	6979129	We argue all the time.
6979809	6981390	But family doesn't, right?
6981410	6984432	Yeah, it's about having different perspectives sometimes.
6984472	6988694	And I realize, especially the AI thing we were talking about, it's a controversial issue, right?
6988754	6992657	And it's a life-changing for many people issue.
6993097	6996019	And so, therefore, people are going to have passionate opinions about it.
6996419	7003484	And I think that's why I tend to, on my opinion, you know, not to bring up the whole conversation again, but that's why I'm like, slow down, buckaroo.
7003504	7005125	Because we're just...
7005745	7006325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7018433	7019013	No, I'm sorry.
7019053	7019894	It's Loki.
7019974	7020314	Sorry.
7020915	7021695	Jeez, Rob.
7021715	7025337	You go on vacation for two weeks and you forget how to podcast.
7025397	7025838	See that part?
7025858	7027599	And you wrote our show role.
7027619	7028719	Remember that part about arguing?
7028859	7030641	Yeah, okay.
7030701	7031041	Loki.
7031581	7032722	We give each other shit all the time.
7032742	7033182	Don't worry about it.
7034063	7037765	We have an announcement of a brand new Tony Hawk remastered game.
7037805	7041547	So Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 announced for July 11th.
7043168	7046632	It's coming out on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC.
7047392	7051156	And will also be on Game Pass Day 1 because it is an Activision title.
7052457	7056821	Very similar to 1 and 2 that they just remastered recently.
7058772	7073155	similar combination of old stuff and new stuff thrown in there so you're going to have all the classic levels and skaters but also modern skaters and new levels as well as the original soundtrack and new stuff as well on top of that.
7073655	7088278	They've got 4K visual support of course, crossplay, multiplayer, creation tools, new game plus, free skate, speedrun modes and new tricks and Activision also confirmed that the original controls and gameplay
7088858	7092660	found in the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1 and 2 are back.
7092900	7096262	So yeah, it looks fun.
7097203	7099804	I used to love playing the old Tony Hawk games.
7100284	7103406	I didn't really play the last remaster, but this looks cool.
7103426	7117334	And of course, if you want to drop extra money on a digital deluxe edition, you get skins, Doom Slayer skins, and the hoverboard, and wireframe Tony Hawk, and skate decks and stuff.
7119246	7120546	Cool, I guess.
7121927	7126068	Then we've got news, more Suikoden news.
7126588	7132169	So they just did a Suikoden Direct type thing for Suikoden Live.
7133150	7133810	That was weird.
7133830	7136991	That was like the day before the release of the 1 and 2 HD mix.
7137071	7140312	And I was like, oh, are they going to announce 3 HD?
7140332	7140872	No.
7141312	7141412	No.
7142512	7143253	No, not yet.
7143373	7149598	No, but they did announce that there's a Suikoden Starleap mobile game coming out.
7150739	7159426	They said with a new 108 star story set in the same world as the earlier series, new release date, it's going to be free to play on iOS and Android.
7160146	7171095	And then they also talked about the animated I guess it's a series, not really sure, but they're doing a full TV animated project to adapt Suikoden 2.
7172509	7177754	as part of the Konami animation, which I forgot was a thing.
7178855	7185361	I mean, cool if it's good, but, you know, again, I'm cautiously optimistic.
7185461	7186622	Emphasis on cautiously.
7187843	7188063	Yeah.
7188263	7188503	All right.
7188884	7191566	Well, I mean, Castlevania was good, so maybe.
7191586	7192066	Yeah, maybe.
7192727	7193788	All right, now, Jamie, what do you have?
7196103	7200185	I forgot because you disrupted my... I have Pac-Man.
7201566	7204387	Bandai Namco is celebrating Pac-Man's 45th birthday.
7204828	7214133	There are museum displays, live experiences, a cookbook with a, quote, maze of imaginative recipes.
7214913	7216734	So, yeah.
7216794	7218155	They're going all out.
7219716	7224319	In their press release, they are saying that their theme is impact.
7225697	7229018	So, I mean, I don't know what that means.
7229038	7230178	Oh my god.
7230278	7232799	Someone brainstormed in a meeting very hard for that one.
7232819	7235700	Right.
7235860	7241802	But they're going to have a special display at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle running from April 30th to June 4th.
7242662	7243903	I love the Museum of Pop Culture.
7243923	7244363	That's cool.
7245143	7248624	And a Pac-Man retrospective exhibition in Great Park Gallery in Irvine.
7249625	7250085	Oh, yay.
7250105	7250605	45, though. 45?
7255663	7256123	I'm older.
7256283	7256624	I know.
7256784	7257224	Me too.
7257984	7259805	I didn't get a cookbook for my 45th birthday.
7259825	7262747	I can make the official OLR cookbook.
7263467	7264948	Things you can make with waffles.
7265268	7266809	I was like, what would even be in that?
7267009	7269890	Double, double, triple bacon, triple bacon waffles.
7271051	7276033	And fried, fried rice balls with cornflakes.
7276994	7278995	Those were really fucking delicious, by the way.
7280514	7304125	DarkTetsuya in chat says I know my arcade has a bunch of new Pac-Man handhelds for the 45th my arcade being the company that's been reproducing a lot of retro stuff interesting I guess that makes sense I feel like the Pac-Man re-release of games I mean we've been there done that like what what Pac-Man don't we have at this point we have all the Pac-Mans in the world so

7616983	7621205	Now chat is sharing all the weird shit that's like anime.
7621305	7622945	So apparently, okay, I did not know this.
7622985	7629748	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, there's an anime where a character gets reincarnated as a vending machine in a fantasy dungeon world.
7629788	7632168	It's called Reborn as a Vending Machine.
7632348	7633609	I Now Wander the Dungeon.
7634849	7635149	What?
7635910	7636470	I love it.
7637550	7639471	Clearly, I picked the wrong hobby.
7639771	7640831	I should have written books.
7641532	7643312	See, this is where AI comes in.
7644333	7644593	Okay.
7645956	7647579	The only anime I am watching right now is Sakamoto Days, which is amazing.
7647599	7648480	Loki, you should watch this.
7660529	7661650	If you haven't watched it, you would like it.
7662070	7663512	I still have to watch so many things.
7663732	7664673	I know, I know.
7664753	7666254	There's so many TV shows I have to watch.
7667515	7668456	It's so good.
7669056	7675862	It's about a retired hitman and everyone decides suddenly that they want to kill him kind of John Wick-ish without, you know, dog issues.
7676823	7683209	But these other people end up hanging out with him and working for him and it's absolutely hilarious.
7683289	7683609	I love it.
7683729	7684490	I love it, love it, love it.
7685899	7689942	The one TV show I watched just ended this week, so I need new things.
7689962	7695146	And that would be The Traitors, featuring the Super Smash Brothers of reality TV shows.
7696107	7699089	We're in the process of re-watching The Good Place.
7699570	7700210	Oh, I love that.
7700230	7702372	That's one of my favorite shows ever.
7702812	7705535	That show has literally come up in conversation like three times this week.
7706851	7709752	I don't know, just very random for a show that got off the air years ago.
7709812	7710413	I love that show.
7710693	7714034	Anyway, Phil of Nine says, Brittany was my fave on The Traitors.
7714174	7715474	Okay, I'm not going to lie.
7716135	7717375	I was rooting for Danielle.
7717535	7718035	That's right.
7718235	7718716	I said it.
7718916	7722177	I was rooting for her because I loved her on Big Brother 3 back in the day.
7722297	7725098	And even though she was messy, messy, messy, like I kind of...
7725698	7729841	I feel like the traitors, there are two distinct audiences watching the traitors.
7730321	7740528	People that love reality shows and like Bravo, Leopardies and that type of thing, those people hated Danielle because they didn't understand that some people will literally do anything to win the games and win the money and all this shit.
7740929	7749414	And then there's the people that watch like The Survivor and Big Brothers and all that stuff like me that's like, she's just playing the game and sometimes it ain't nice, but when it's over, it's over.
7749514	7750335	Like, it's just a game.
7750855	7751436	So whatever.
7751536	7754218	But anyway, I'm not going to spoil what I will say.
7755475	7761438	The best thing that came from that TV show, Gabby Windy from The Bachelor.
7761498	7764880	And I would never thought I would like anybody from Bachelor Nation.
7764900	7767301	Because you want to talk about reality shows?
7767581	7770042	I know some of y'all judge me for my love of certain reality shows.
7770283	7773444	But even I sit here and go, but The Bachelor is where I draw the fucking line.
7773724	7776146	Those shows are trash.
7776466	7779067	So I never thought I would like Gabby Windy.
7779948	7780248	But...
7780988	7783690	She is so fucking brilliant.
7784270	7785491	Brilliant.
7785631	7786991	And she has her own podcast.
7787051	7789032	You know I never talk about other podcasts on the show.
7789473	7793095	But if you ever listen to Long-Winded with Gabby Windy, I recommend it.
7793635	7801719	It's literally 45 minutes of Jennifer Coolidge, but 20 years younger, just sitting there talking shit into a microphone.
7802139	7802740	Do you remember?
7802780	7807883	I'm about to give all of you at Orange Lounge Radio that were here in 2002 the biggest fucking throwback.
7808783	7809944	I remember when we had them.
7809964	7810144	Oh, fuck.
7827757	7831079	I just now remember Jahi's experience with tequila at Jessica's place.
7852130	7857851	You know, she has a nice cameo in the latest Minecraft movie trailer, too.
7858491	7859232	Oh, Jennifer Coolidge?
7860032	7860312	Yeah.
7860612	7861372	Oh, I love her.
7861632	7862252	I love her, too.
7862372	7864933	This is about Gabby Windy, but yes, I love Jennifer Coolidge as well.
7865193	7866113	They get compared a lot.
7866413	7872055	In fact, I think even on the reunion, she was asked, like, you get compared to Jennifer Coolidge a lot.
7872075	7873255	What do you think of that comparison?
7873555	7878056	And she actually said, well, in this game, I did feel like these gays, they're trying to murder me.
7879940	7881881	which is a good reference.
7882201	7882782	That's her humor.
7882822	7883302	She's so funny.
7883342	7887764	Anyway, I'm going to start a podcast about how I'm a big fan of hers.
7888104	7890646	But for now, we've got one more news story for you about video games.
7890806	7891246	So, Loki.
7892827	7893287	Alright.
7893467	7901011	Well, tangentially about video games, but it's certainly going to affect us if they end up going public.
7901551	7906734	But Discord, it's rumored that Discord may be in talks to go public.
7907614	7908855	Basically, there's
7910367	7930446	There's no confirmed anything about it, but apparently the thought is that they're going to try to raise money that way by being publicly traded, which means that they are going to turn to crap, unfortunately.
7932788	7935391	Yeah, I'm not looking forward to if that happens.
7936138	7939523	So, so it's a good little callback to the beginning of the show.
7939983	7945570	Here's going to be that word in shitification again, because this is what's going to happen to Discord.
7945891	7952379	When they go public, you better be prepared for the in shitification of this app, because this is when it's going to be, oh, um...
7953260	7959682	Please watch this ad before joining video chat or, oh, in this news channel that does updates.
7959742	7961023	Here's the latest crypto.
7961483	7962643	So it's, yeah, I know.
7962803	7965924	And everything you hate about those other apps is going to come to Discord.
7966265	7969726	When I think people have to remember, why did we all join Discord in the first place?
7970066	7971126	Because it's free.
7971506	7977789	Now, I realize free things don't print money, but Discord seems to be doing okay for itself so far off Nitro subscriptions.
7977809	7978689	They have their Nitro thing.
7978929	7979769	and stuff like that.
7980010	7985132	Which Blue Sky is modeling its payment model after Discord Nitro.
7985472	7989733	And so it just has me worried like, well, when's the unshitification of Blue Sky going to happen?
7989813	7994715	Although with Blue Sky being built on App Protocol, I would argue it's going to be a lot harder.
7995316	7997617	But I don't want to cross that bridge for a good long time.
7998357	7998477	So...
7999520	8002921	I mean, like, look at, like, talking about, like, old things becoming new again.
8003321	8007183	Was it just this week, Digg announced that they're coming back?
8007723	8008903	Like, okay.
8009383	8011144	Well, is that the same thing, like, a claim?
8011184	8012084	Like, it's just the name?
8012685	8014045	Or what's his, Kevin Rose?
8014705	8015105	Him too?
8015165	8017266	At this point, I'm going back to LiveJournal, bye.
8018066	8020687	It's still the same people, but they're coming back.
8021007	8025349	It's one of the co-founders of Reddit, not Spez, and Kevin Rose.
8025819	8026939	Serena Williams' husband?
8027480	8028700	Alex, what's his name?
8029020	8029901	Yeah, something like that.
8029961	8031321	Yeah, I don't remember what his name is.
8031401	8032742	But yeah.
8033842	8034162	Okay.
8035823	8036403	We'll see.
8036663	8042025	I mean, I just... Yeah, I just... Here's the thing.
8042085	8042685	And yeah, I know.
8042745	8043946	DJ Ranma S says, what ads?
8044606	8048507	If Discord goes public, then they will be out to make money for their shareholders.
8048808	8051549	And how do you think they will be able to print more money for their shareholders?
8051769	8053689	With... ads.
8054630	8055090	It's coming.
8055885	8056285	It's coming.
8057266	8057986	Hopefully not.
8058206	8065649	Hopefully this is all just hysteria, but unfortunately, and you know, and SG100 Matt says going public is the precursor to looking for someone to buy you sometimes.
8066029	8068870	Hasn't there been offers to buy Discord before?
8068970	8071811	Didn't Microsoft try to buy them several years ago?
8071951	8073631	I'm almost positive that was the thing.
8073932	8078433	Microsoft tried to buy Discord some time ago and Discord fended it off.
8078693	8078933	Yeah.
8079173	8083395	They're currently valued at $15 billion, according to Financial Times.
8083735	8084977	So, I don't know
8106980	8107260	All right.
8107780	8117548	Let's go to the listener roundtable where we usually would take emails, but we don't have any emails tonight over at participate at orange lounge radio dot com.
8117908	8120350	And I think for time, we're just going to go ahead and script through this tonight.
8120450	8126134	But in the future, we'll take calls in our green room as well over at Twitch dot TV slash VOG Network.
8126194	8126715	Sorry, Rama.
8126755	8129937	I'm going to move to wrap up the show, but I look forward to speaking to you in a future week.
8130598	8131739	I see you in the green room right now.
8132679	8150707	but yeah, we're gonna wrap up for now so I will go over to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories I do not have any last minute stories okay, good deal oh my god, Gaga on SNL I didn't see it, I haven't was it funny?
8150747	8160091	I'm talking about her performance of Abracadabra her new album is fire oh it totally is, but her performance was flawless flawless
8162060	8166044	And by the way, Bobby wanted to send this along, DarkSakura.
8166105	8168808	It's Thunder Force running on his cab.
8169148	8170690	It's so tiny on your phone.
8170830	8172052	I have the window small.
8172172	8174434	Wait, can I do, I can do, I can do that.
8174895	8175356	I can do that.
8177121	8180163	DarkTetsuya says there's new Tetris Grandmaster 4 footage.
8180183	8184706	I saw that that announced trailer just went out, so I definitely want to see that as well, for sure.
8184726	8187368	No, didn't they do a big thing earlier today?
8200356	8202057	Yeah, I just posted it in Discord.
8202177	8204258	I watched a little bit off and on.
8204358	8208601	I didn't listen to the audio because, you know, we're live.
8209721	8213283	But I just peered through it and it looks interesting.
8213303	8215985	There's a character that looks like Solid Snake.
8216946	8217626	Here's the thing.
8219486	8225768	I just expect everything that comes out of Hideo Kojima's factory is going to be very abstract in all the previews.
8225828	8226648	It always is.
8227108	8232529	But then, you know, by the time Death Stranding actually released, it was a little artsy-fartsy, but I liked it a lot.
8232589	8236790	It was very poignant considering that it came out right before COVID.
8236950	8241110	Like, that game actually fucking hit hard because of everything that happened in 2020.
8241250	8243571	It had Farrah.
8243951	8244131	Yeah.
8245427	8246248	I'll be interested to see.
8246268	8247249	That wasn't Pharaoh, was it?
8248370	8252974	No, it had the Bionic Woman was in it.
8253034	8257158	Lizzie Wagner, why was I saying... My practical namesake.
8259386	8260587	All right.
8261487	8264849	With that, we're going to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
8264909	8270031	Thank you, as always, for listening to our show and participating with us tonight.

8272713	8276955	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
8277275	8283138	A nice five-star review on a site like Apple Podcasts or YouTube or Spotify or wherever you found this show.
8283458	8285719	It goes an awful long way and we really appreciate it.
8286680	8287820	We'll be back next week.
8288080	8288861	No more breaks.
8289281	8291902	We'll be back next week, hopefully, unless there's an emergency.
8291962	8296664	But we'll be back next week to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming and everything that's happened in the last week.
8297264	8300606	Until then, DarkSakura, I know live tonight you're going to go do your thing.
8301326	8302466	You playing DBD tonight?
8303507	8304047	Yeah, I am.
8304127	8304747	A little bit.
8304827	8305508	Okay, that'll be fun.
8306668	8308989	I messaged Shay and friends.
8310110	8312471	Yeah, I want to play with my friends tonight, so we'll do it.
8312931	8317553	And my final thought for this show is...
8319830	8320851	Think and resist.
8321771	8322032	All right.
8322412	8322872	Have a good one.
8322912	8323533	We'll see you next time.
8324773	8325574	Later, tater.
8325774	8326174	Bye.
8327115	8329417	Loki, that takes us to you and your final thought for tonight.
8330457	8341665	Oh, I forgot to mention it when we were talking about the PlayStation rentals, but I was going to make the joke, you know, hey, if money can't buy happiness, I guess we'll have to rent it.
8343606	8345147	That's a good outlook on life, Loki.
8345167	8345287	Yeah.
8347901	8353024	Alright, and my final thought tonight is I don't know.
8353464	8357046	I'm looking forward already to the 2026 Star Trek cruise.
8358227	8359928	So I'll be gone again next year.
8361469	8362830	But I'm looking forward to it very much.
8364311	8365331	It's my little happy place.
8365371	8369133	And wherever your happy place is, I hope you are able to spend some time in it this week.
8369514	8370454	So we'll see you in seven days.
8370494	8371295	We'll do it all over again.
8371375	8372155	Have a great night, everybody.
8372195	8372795	Bye!
8374897	8377178	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8379329	8379829	See you next week.
