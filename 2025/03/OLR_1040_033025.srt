1
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: The news this week is full of trends.

2
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:13,037
[SPEAKER_03]: New releases this year.

3
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Continued cuts and industry shrinking.

4
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,198
[SPEAKER_03]: The strike goes on, but we commit to opportunity.

5
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:19,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And also returning the spotlight to Warner Bros.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,920
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to kill the opportunity to make money and continuing to fail to launch.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mixed bag, but at least it's news.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't believe everything you read, especially not after this show.

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The April Fools will come out attempting to make fools of us all.

10
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:31,462
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last gasp of March.

11
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:35,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this week's gaming news.

12
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:38,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting right now on the show, every gamer has voice...

13
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:42,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

14
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:46,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

15
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:56,669
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live once again tonight, episode number 1040 for March the 30th of 2025.

16
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:03,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, as Jason pointed out in the intro there, be wary of April Fool's jokes coming up this week, but none on tonight's show.

17
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,853
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the clear for that, but I think we all know

18
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:18,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Little pranksters love to prank and come out with fake news things on April 1st, which I legitimately think is why Nintendo is doing a direct on April 2nd, just to steer the boat clear of any of that shenanigans.

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,383
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also why Behaviour's doing their announcements on the 2nd as well.

20
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:24,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

22
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:31,248
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, so not the only company doing announcements on April 2nd, purposefully steering clear of the 1st.

23
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:32,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, makes sense.

24
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:58,844
[SPEAKER_01]: and which is uh wise yes is that like not even a real holiday knock it off people is April 2nd when they're going to patch in that manga killer they announced recently they're doing a live and then it's typically right after they do those the live uh sorry that the actual thing goes live gotcha okay interesting uh also say hello to the one and only tech master Loki hello hi how are you Loki

25
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone can play in that

26
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:18,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's the new hottest right now.

27
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, I have seen a lot of streamers.

28
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:24,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like I've been out of the loop on Twitch culture a little bit.

29
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:27,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, outside this show, like I've barely watched my favorite streamers.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,271
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nothing, nothing's wrong.

31
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:33,678
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just I've been oddly busy IRL, which I'm not going to complain about.

32
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,440
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, so I just haven't.

33
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I get the notifications and I'm always like, what is this R.E.P.O.

34
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,466
[SPEAKER_11]: game everybody's freaking streaming?

35
00:02:41,546 --> 00:02:51,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Lethal Company in the sense that you're going to a place and there's like monsters that you have to avoid and you have to bring back loot and stuff and try not to die and all that thing.

36
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,135
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like that, but it's funnier.

37
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:53,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

38
00:02:54,868 --> 00:03:03,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

39
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do have folks in our chat.

40
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:08,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Tigerclaw, linked us to buy that on the store.

41
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:13,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get some type of VOG Network kickback key for those links one of these days.

42
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually don't think those exist on Steam.

43
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Questbuster says, I still miss the old Irem April Fool's jokes.

44
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:21,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes.

45
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Some companies do have cute April Fool's things.

46
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:27,163
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to be in the right mindset for it, right?

47
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:34,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I love stuff that's so over-the-top and ridiculous that it's obvious it's an April Fool's thing.

48
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard used to do a lot of those, to be fair.

49
00:03:37,346 --> 00:03:50,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember what they've done the last couple years, and it's probably been toned down ever since they were in the spotlight for hella legit reasons, but they used to do some pretty over-the-top stuff that was a lot of fun, so I'll be curious if Blizzard does anything this year.

50
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:57,032
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuya says there is also the should be fake but it's actually real news too.

51
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:58,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, there's that too.

52
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, we'll get that April 2nd.

53
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:06,195
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerCloud pointing out there have been April Fool's jokes that become actual products.

54
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:12,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously the first thing that comes to mind is Google's Maps Pokemon kinda was in a way Pokemon Go.

55
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:18,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't the mini fridge from Xbox, that was an April Fool's thing too, wasn't it?

56
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:39,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a full-size fridge and it I mean it wasn't it was a joke but also it was a thing that they sold okay okay in limited quantities it was just like the joke would be that it's like being widely released but they did release a few okay um not a lot though it was like kind of a contest thing

57
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:47,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf says the ties I wear were the original Think Geek April Fool's gag that they turned real, the 8-bit tie.

58
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what piece of nerd paraphernalia I bought this week?

59
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you heard about this whole thing at South by Southwest, but...

60
00:04:56,768 --> 00:05:06,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It was something, it was a shirt that Mark Zuckerberg wore that said, basically, it was like a Roman quote or something that was like trying to compare him to Caesar or something like that.

61
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:14,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Like basically saying, like, you know, kind of pronouncing what a great person he is in his own mind.

62
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,462
[SPEAKER_11]: But then the great thing was- Which Caesar?

63
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,863
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them got stabbed in the back.

64
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:19,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

65
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:23,526
[SPEAKER_11]: What was, now I'm going to, I'm going to, it's going to bug myself.

66
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:24,827
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it wasn't that one.

67
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:33,674
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I'm never prepared to talk about these things on air, which is why I have to research.

68
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:38,157
[SPEAKER_11]: But okay, so what was it said?

69
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:41,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Out Caesar, Out Neil.

70
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,241
[SPEAKER_11]: Either Caesar or nothing.

71
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But the shirt actually said Out Zuck, Out Neil.

72
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:46,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

73
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:50,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Zuckerberg, Blue Sky, Jay Graber, Mundus Sine Caesaribus, A World Without Caesars

74
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:36,253
[SPEAKER_11]: and so they actually sold replica shirts of that on Blue Sky's site and they charged a little premium for it they charged 40 bucks for it and it was $10 shipping I bought because the money is to go support Blue Sky I bought one because I'm like sure I'll support Blue Sky it's obviously that type of shade I'm gonna throw money at that that's great and yeah I wanted one and I just thought that was some world class shade going on from Blue Sky so hell yeah I bought one of those shirts

75
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:39,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even know they were there.

76
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:40,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have got one.

77
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:44,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was announced on Blue Sky's official thing.

78
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:46,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, they only sold them for a limited time.

79
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:47,585
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wonder if they'll come back.

80
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if they'll come back.

81
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the site will be worldwithoutcaesars.com Right?

82
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,069
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

83
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:44,829
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a huge Nintendo time of year.

84
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So Loki's going to recap a somewhat surprise Nintendo Direct from this week for us.

85
00:07:50,155 --> 00:08:02,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I say surprise because we were only told two days beforehand, but if you believe rumors and scuttlebutt, one of the rumors out there was pegging that there was going to be a pre-Nintendo Switch 2 Direct this week.

86
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:07,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And we know that the big Nintendo Switch 2 unveil official.

87
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we had the little teaser, but we're going to get the official unveiling next week on the 2nd.

88
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,592
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll get into some of that later.

89
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:23,455
[SPEAKER_11]: But first, we have the Nintendo Direct from this week, which was focusing on, I guess, the last hurrah for the original Nintendo Switch.

90
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:24,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, kind of.

91
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:29,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Some third parties will still support it for a while, but yeah.

92
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of the stuff that they were showing off, too...

93
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:57,477
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of similar to what we see what we've seen with a few other of kind of end of life start of a new generation type releases where you'll have games coming out on multiple platforms I think because I they showed off um one of the like the big reveals that they showed was more uh gameplay from Metroid Prime 4 and that it's going to be out this year so you would imply that it's

94
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:26,397
[SPEAKER_02]: probably going to be a Switch 1 game but also I'm wondering if there's like a Switch 2 enhancements to go along with it that we'll find out you know on Tuesday here or Wednesday I guess that would be the second so yeah it's going to be interesting lots of things a lot of smaller things as well so starting off we had a Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD remake those are going to be coming out over here as well so that's supposed to be coming out later this year

95
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:36,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we have a new detective game from Konami called No Sleep for Kanamane Date.

96
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:40,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, From AI, The Somnium Files.

97
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So many words in those titles.

98
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is coming out July 25th.

99
00:09:48,337 --> 00:10:14,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Raido Remastered, The Mystery of the Soulless Army It's supposed to be a game that came out on the PlayStation 2 a long time ago And now coming out on the Switch June 19th Shadow Labyrinth, that weird game that was based off of the Amazon series for Pac-Man That is going to be coming out July 18th Oh yeah, that, I remember that

100
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird, but I kind of dig it.

101
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like it.

102
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be coming out July 18th.

103
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:27,433
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of surprising.

104
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:31,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Patapon from the PSP coming out on the Switch.

105
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:35,695
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're doing remasters of Patapon 1 and 2.

106
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was a surprise.

107
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:37,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

108
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco is the one that's going to be doing the...

109
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:11,419
[SPEAKER_02]: The release of this, I believe.

110
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:12,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I saw Namco's name on it.

111
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:20,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's certainly possible like a studio made it and Sony published it and now maybe the rights came out or something and now another studio is doing it.

112
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

113
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,311
[SPEAKER_11]: That publishing stuff gets complicated.

114
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Mike Depp says it is a Sony title.

115
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, but rights get weird.

116
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,186
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen... You've seen games... Everything is weird.

117
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:32,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and you've seen games... No, it is.

118
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:32,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Sony.

119
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Sony title.

120
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:37,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a Sony Interactive Entertainment developed by Bandai Namco.

121
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:45,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of weird in that sense, but it is licensed and, yeah, it does have Sony as credited on there.

122
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:56,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, those weird sorts of things that happened before, like I, you know, throwing out there, like Illusion of Gaia and that series, Nintendo actually published, you know, here, and even though it was an Enix game at the time, and anyway...

123
00:11:58,735 --> 00:11:59,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

124
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:07,341
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still a Sony, you know, a game that we all know from the Sony PSP, PS Vita sort of era coming out for Switch.

125
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that is great.

126
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to get seen by a new crowd, which is pretty cool.

127
00:12:13,084 --> 00:12:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a story of Seasons Grand Bazaar, which is going to be coming to the Switch August 27th.

128
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:23,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a series that was on the original DS.

129
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:25,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that kind of, I think it's been off of Harvest Moon.

130
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:44,080
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course like I mentioned Metroid Prime 4 Beyond that was a big thing that they showed off showing off actual gameplay and what it's going to kind of look like which it's a bit different looking but I like the way it looks and that is sometime in 2025 that that's coming out

131
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,004
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that's a holiday game or if it's going to be a Switch 2 release title.

132
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:52,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that's kind of the unknown factor there, the question mark.

133
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:55,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to get a version of that on Switch 2?

134
00:12:55,351 --> 00:13:05,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to see that game again next week that maybe is possibly a slight bit enhanced or just, you know, like in a Zelda Breath of the Wild kind of way, right?

135
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, yeah.

136
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Wii U, and Switch game.

137
00:13:09,044 --> 00:13:17,211
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just we're now in this unique situation where the Switch 2 will play Switch games, which wasn't a factor with the Wii U and Switch type of thing.

138
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be interesting to see.

139
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:24,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's a lot of interesting stuff that's going to be answered with next, hopefully, answered with next week's thing.

140
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where I'm at is I'm kind of like, okay, but is it going to be on the Switch 2?

141
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I want the Switch 2 version of it.

142
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:30,122
[SPEAKER_11]: That's...

143
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Where my head is at with a lot of Switch games.

144
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you're going to want that.

145
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game that they announced, Villains Cursed Cafe.

146
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:48,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is like a mobile game that's being ported to the Switch, but it's a cafe game with dizzy villains and you make them drink some potions.

147
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:50,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

148
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to read a quick comment from chat on Story of Seasons.

149
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf does say that is the original Harvest Moon.

150
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,391
[SPEAKER_11]: The Harvest Moon today is not the same series as the original Harvest Moon.

151
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:04,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So Story of Seasons is for, you know, the old school fans, I guess.

152
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So you were on the right line of thinking there, Loki.

153
00:14:08,653 --> 00:14:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

154
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:12,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, like, this is going back to when I sold games.

155
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:17,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember selling those and had the, you know... What's Harvest Moon?

156
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:17,395
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

157
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:17,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

158
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:34,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is cool, like in Witchbrook, it is an isometric pixel art RPG following, looks like someone going through like a magical academy and they have a different like co-op for up to four players.

159
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:36,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks very pretty.

160
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the art style in it.

161
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this is a magical university game I can get behind.

162
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

163
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:45,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

164
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Unlike, nevermind.

165
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, yep, yep.

166
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:53,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had The Eternal Life of Goldman.

167
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,213
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hand-drawn platforming adventure game.

168
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked pretty cool looking.

169
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

170
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:06,180
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I got very excited about because I am a big fan of this series.

171
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Gradius Origins.

172
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:08,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yes.

173
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:09,983
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be awesome.

174
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:15,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all of the Gradius games put together, I think, for the most part.

175
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:20,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Gradius 5 was in there or not, but also a brand new game, Salamander 3.

176
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:22,984
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's extra rad about this.

177
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're putting a new game in it.

178
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, hell yes.

179
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:29,128
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder if it was like a prototype that got canceled or something.

180
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:31,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so down for that.

181
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if there will be repeats from the... Because Konami had an arcade collection...

182
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:39,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't have done it if I got it.

183
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:57,527
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've got the Salamander Deluxe Pack for Saturn.

184
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:01,430
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all kinds of collections because every time something comes out, we end up getting it.

185
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure.

186
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it has, it says it comes with 17 versions, six titles from Arcade Origins.

187
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:07,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

188
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,674
[SPEAKER_11]: So six titles, okay, that overlap.

189
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:10,715
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, Arcade Origins.

190
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:11,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So six titles do overlap.

191
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,276
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's okay, that's okay.

192
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:19,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Gradius, it looks like Gradius 2, Gradius, Gradius 3, Salamander, Salamander 2, and Life Force.

193
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:25,221
[SPEAKER_11]: This feels like the album being re-released with some really solid extra tracks.

194
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:27,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine with it.

195
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,043
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been long enough.

196
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:36,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the 17 games we're talking about too, that includes also all of the different versions of the ROMs.

197
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:40,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the JP and North American, Europe.

198
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,113
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing some creative counting.

199
00:16:42,313 --> 00:16:42,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

200
00:16:44,395 --> 00:17:01,474
[SPEAKER_11]: and it should be like this will almost certainly not be a Nintendo exclusive thing this is just how a lot of people will probably pick it up because they have Nintendo memories from playing these games on the NES or they want the portable versions but I mean 99.99% this is out on PlayStation 5 and I would say 98% this is out on Xbox

201
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,742
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have different modes in there as well.

202
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:13,245
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a rewind, so you can rewind it if you mess up.

203
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:18,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy mode, with a smaller hit detection area.

204
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have invincible mode.

205
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,814
[SPEAKER_02]: It counts the number of times the enemies... Let's see here.

206
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see because of this stuff.

207
00:17:28,316 --> 00:17:31,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, like you're invincible, but it counts the number of times the enemies hit you.

208
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,952
[SPEAKER_11]: so that you still have like a score to sort of achieve.

209
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Those games are very difficult.

210
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:43,515
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I, okay, I don't want to spoil my gaming week, but I randomly fucking played Life Force on the NES this week.

211
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:47,017
[SPEAKER_11]: And I forgot how unforgiving that game is.

212
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,498
[SPEAKER_11]: You literally have to memorize things in the stage.

213
00:17:49,538 --> 00:18:02,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Like that first stage with the brain boss, you have to remember like, oh, you got to take the top path because if you take the bottom path, it grows that kind of brain cell stuff or whatever it's supposed to be like right in front of you and you die.

214
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:27,377
[SPEAKER_11]: so like you have to remember how to go certain paths to get through levels that's how those fucking arcade machines ate your quarters too so um yeah like in no shame in using invincible mode in some of these games like or you'll never see the end of them yeah the Konami code exists for a reason yeah that's that's true too Sean322 says spoiler alert oh give me for a game from 1987 sit down

215
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was already a series.

216
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:50,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Crypt of the NecroDancer, but this Rift is going to be different.

217
00:18:50,822 --> 00:18:56,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Crypt of the NecroDancer was more of like an actual dungeon crawling game where you had to move to the beat.

218
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,764
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an actual rhythm game.

219
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,305
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're still also attacking enemies and stuff.

220
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:06,867
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like three different lanes and you kind of have to jump between those or hit the different buttons to do different attacks and stuff.

221
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Real talk, folks.

222
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:15,169
[SPEAKER_11]: If Harmonix wasn't going to make a new Rock Band Blitz for consoles, I'm glad somebody did it.

223
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Legally distinct.

224
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:16,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

225
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that.

226
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:28,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Tamagotchi Plaza looks crazy with all the different Miis in there.

227
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:34,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a thing coming June 27th.

228
00:19:35,376 --> 00:19:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what else?

229
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:44,680
[SPEAKER_02]: We got more footage of Pokemon Legends Z to A. And yeah, it looks good.

230
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach!

231
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,402
[SPEAKER_11]: The game, I really hope, has a Switch 2 enhanced version.

232
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially after... And I'm going to be completely honest.

233
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:55,685
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not watch the Direct Live because, look...

234
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Some time zone is going to get screwed in this whole thing.

235
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:03,187
[SPEAKER_11]: When you're doing these worldwide announcements, some time zone is going to get screwed.

236
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:05,509
[SPEAKER_11]: And we get screwed with a 6 a.m.

237
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,269
[SPEAKER_11]: start time for this.

238
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,412
[SPEAKER_11]: East Coast can have a nice little breakfast thing.

239
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:10,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Europe is, what, 2 o'clock.

240
00:20:11,073 --> 00:20:12,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Japan is 10 o'clock.

241
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:14,056
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like the evening news, right?

242
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,557
[SPEAKER_11]: We get 6 a.m.

243
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,059
[SPEAKER_11]: The only time zone I would say that has it worse than us is Hawaii.

244
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's...

245
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:22,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Hawaii's like three or four in the morning.

246
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:26,004
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just not going to be watching this unless they get up early.

247
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:30,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't really watch these things live when they're that early because I value my sleep.

248
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:38,730
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did watch the Z to A and I was like, oh, I hope they get a more powerful system to put this on.

249
00:20:39,471 --> 00:21:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be a lot of the same problems from Gen 10 It's gotta be It's gotta be Oh my god, please, please Game Freak, please, hear my prayers Why would you make a brand new console and then just like, oh yeah it's not gonna be on that brand new console, it's gonna be stuck with the lower power, come on It's a Pokemon game, of course they're going to We'll see We'll see, we'll see

250
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:14,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, another neat surprise, Rhythm Heaven Groove, brand new Rhythm Heaven game coming to the Switch as well.

251
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what my TikTok algorithm has found?

252
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:24,333
[SPEAKER_11]: People live reacting to the Rhythm Heaven announcement and losing their fucking mind.

253
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:32,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And the funny thing is, what always gives it away is that very distinct advancing the text box noise that the Rhythm Heaven games have.

254
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Like everybody's kind of looking at it at first like, is this Rhythm Heaven?

255
00:21:36,041 --> 00:22:03,067
[SPEAKER_02]: could it be and then the text advances everybody goes oh my god it's rhythm heaven you know the way everybody hacks online during these live react things and it's pretty funny so yeah no I'm excited too so then breaking up all the game announcements and different things releasing there was an announcement of a brand new system that is coming to Nintendo and that is this virtual game card system

256
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:14,372
[SPEAKER_02]: and what it is, it is a way to be able to trade and loan out your digital game library to other Switches or Switch 2s.

257
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:22,735
[SPEAKER_11]: So, for example, if you live in a household... There's a very important asterisk here because I was excited until this asterisk.

258
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:23,936
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, well, this does nothing for me.

259
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby took a deep dive on this on his show tonight.

260
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially locally.

261
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:32,640
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have to be on your family plan and locally.

262
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:36,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can only share with people on your family plan.

263
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:37,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it works.

264
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm on a family plan with friends.

265
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so no, that works.

266
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:46,359
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're on a family plan with friends and you go visit those friends in person, you can loan the games.

267
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,119
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

268
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,523
[SPEAKER_11]: But for me, I'm not on a family plan.

269
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:54,186
[SPEAKER_11]: And even if Alan and I were on a family plan, it wouldn't do us a lot of good.

270
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:57,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hoping it was without the asterisk.

271
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:08,397
[SPEAKER_11]: That you just had to be on the same local network, which I'm totally okay with because loaning games across the internet would lead to all sorts of weird Reddit circles and things and it would hurt game developers.

272
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:20,744
[SPEAKER_11]: But locally, oh my god, that would add so much value to digital games to be able to be like, hey, so we're getting together in person to play Mario Party and oh shit, you have Bellatro?

273
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:21,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I borrow that?

274
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:44,484
[SPEAKER_11]: and you just click you just do it digitally and you can't play it for 14 days but they can it's like loaning out a cartridge but you know that cartridge is coming back in 14 days and if that's not enough time you do it again although I don't think we know the cool down period but unfortunately it is limited to family plans which my hope fingers crossed toes crossed eyes crossed my hope is that

275
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:48,129
[SPEAKER_11]: This is maybe the test for maybe making it broader.

276
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:56,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm even okay if they limit it to people on your Nintendo friends list so that you can't just like go to a random convention and loan out games for your booth or something.

277
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to be on your friends list.

278
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's both though.

279
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:03,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can lend it to people that are in your...

280
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

281
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:05,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

282
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:31,063
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have two systems... Okay, here's what it says on the Nintendo.com website.

283
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:34,626
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going... I'm going... I'm going to the source to figure this out.

284
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:39,949
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, the virtual game card feature for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 systems adds some of the flexibility.

285
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,753
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have two systems, you can digitally eject and load games from one system to another.

286
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:49,238
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can even lend games to members of your Nintendo account family group.

287
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,601
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the wording that worries me.

288
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:59,690
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have two systems, that doesn't mean you and somebody... If you have a system and your friend has a system, or that would be worded differently.

289
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:00,872
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is like...

290
00:25:01,372 --> 00:25:05,435
[SPEAKER_11]: because Nintendo has released a Switch, a Switch Lite, a Switch OLED.

291
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:09,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very – or your Shane and you buy all the Pokemon Switches.

292
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:10,960
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a Shane feature.

293
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,443
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who's going to benefit from this with his 17 Switches and Pokemon games.

294
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:23,209
[SPEAKER_11]: You can loan the games amongst yourself, but it doesn't do anything with friends or anything like that, which is –

295
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:24,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of a bummer.

296
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:30,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then land games to members of your Nintendo account family group.

297
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:33,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing to do with the other part about having the multiple systems.

298
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:36,776
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Loki, I'm right there with you, though.

299
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:40,359
[SPEAKER_11]: The wording was, or at least the way I understood it, because again, I didn't watch it live.

300
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,681
[SPEAKER_11]: The way I understood it at first was like really exciting.

301
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,683
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, holy shit, Nintendo ahead of its time.

302
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:46,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

303
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:48,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this whole thing, right?

304
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:51,428
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when I saw the rest of it, I was like, oh.

305
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:53,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Not as exciting.

306
00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Except, and to be fair, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Nintendo thinks people will have a Switch and a Switch 2.

307
00:26:01,016 --> 00:26:01,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course they will.

308
00:26:02,156 --> 00:26:03,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I will have a Switch and a Switch 2.

309
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:04,919
[SPEAKER_11]: So that will be useful.

310
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:14,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I can get the digital loading from my original Switch so I can play things like Pokemon Scarlet, which I bought digitally, on my Switch 2.

311
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, there is still some benefit for me.

312
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:29,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe this is what it is because my thought was, well, why wouldn't it just be like the fucking PlayStation where I go in the store and I download the game just like I did on PlayStation, but maybe it's some funky thing with rights.

313
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:30,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

314
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,931
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:53,223
[SPEAKER_11]: This could be so big.

316
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:57,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to derail too much, but it is a weird Enigma thing.

317
00:26:57,592 --> 00:26:59,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll hear more about it next week.

318
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,662
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's not as exciting as it could have been.

319
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,096
[SPEAKER_02]: No, understandable.

320
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a little confusing.

321
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:08,798
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's exciting.

322
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:17,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, if you are two parents and two kids, if you're a two-parent, two-kid household type of thing, oh my god, this is huge for you.

323
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:24,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck, even if you're just a two-adult household that both actively game, like a Jamie and Dan household that both actively game, yeah, you can like lend...

324
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:26,795
[SPEAKER_11]: games between each other.

325
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,098
[SPEAKER_11]: But like Loki, for you, I don't, you have a Switch.

326
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:31,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine your kids have a Switch.

327
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,321
[SPEAKER_11]: You can all loan games to each other.

328
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:34,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you only have one.

329
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:36,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there'll be a Switch 2 at some point, I'm sure.

330
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:38,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly didn't pay for my Switch.

331
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:39,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in at work.

332
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:40,428
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

333
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:40,829
[SPEAKER_11]: It's yours.

334
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:48,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it means, I mean, there's no logical reason for us to have more than one in this house.

335
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:48,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I get it.

336
00:27:48,976 --> 00:27:49,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

337
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:57,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're probably going to get a Switch 2, but we didn't get a PS5 or an Xbox, you know?

338
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,911
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of were just like, done with it.

339
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I already know I'm getting a Switch.

340
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,352
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole social thing, kind of done with it.

341
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:07,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get a Switch 2 day one, provided the pre-orders allow me to.

342
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:15,238
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my biggest scare right now, is that it's going to be a cluster fucky McFuckerson town trying to get one of those Switch 2 pre-orders.

343
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:20,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, I'm probably going to get a stream deck before I get a Switch 2.

344
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,004
[SPEAKER_11]: A stream deck or a Steam deck?

345
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:25,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Steam deck, whatever.

346
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:28,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bajillion stream decks already.

347
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,368
[SPEAKER_01]: A Steam deck.

348
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:31,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Steam decks are fun.

349
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:35,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to have a bigger library on it.

350
00:28:35,812 --> 00:28:37,694
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still handheld.

351
00:28:38,114 --> 00:28:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still plug it into my TV.

352
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:41,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I already have one.

353
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:44,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not super excited about the Switch 2.

354
00:28:46,222 --> 00:29:13,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be excited until there's a game on it I give a shit about well let's check in after April 2nd because that'll be Nintendo's chance to say here are the games to substantiate your hype so we'll see, let's check back in next week so alright, anyway, sorry Loki but that was an important point and then yeah, there are a bunch of smaller announcements so High End Life is getting ported to the Switch on May 6th that's the Rick and Morty gun game, right?

355
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, basically.

356
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:24,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Overdrive is another cool-looking game that's coming out on April 10th.

357
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:35,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a... It almost has a similar art style to Sunset Overdrive or... What was the other one?

358
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:40,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it's a futuristic hoverboard action game.

359
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:42,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals Time

360
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's coming out May 21st.

361
00:30:08,712 --> 00:30:09,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearment calendar.

362
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:11,014
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right around Memorial Day again.

363
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Saga Frontier 2 Remastered.

364
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:15,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorgeous looking game.

365
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:19,359
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be... That was one of those, hey, it's out today.

366
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:20,539
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's out now.

367
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Go check it out.

368
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to just... Y'all know I did not care for the original Saga Frontier, but maybe I'd like to.

369
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:26,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

370
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,064
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much to play.

371
00:30:28,584 --> 00:30:33,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Monument Valley 1 and 2, and apparently 3 now, are going to...

372
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:35,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's Golf

373
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise known as Hot Shots.

374
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually called Everybody's Golf Hot Shots because it's Hot Shots Golf here.

375
00:31:07,578 --> 00:31:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil Biohazard.

376
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:12,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

377
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:15,018
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

378
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:24,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of the games that I'm most excited about, a brand new beat-em-up fighting game called Marvel Cosmic Invasion.

379
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:28,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by the folks that did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game originally.

380
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a throwback to the old arcade stuff.

381
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:31,525
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be fun.

382
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited to play that.

383
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:36,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if that's going to be like those Marvel Ultimate games.

384
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:37,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember Jamie was super into those games.

385
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:39,288
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

386
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,789
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a pure side-scroller beat-em-up.

387
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:42,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that'll still be fun.

388
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,735
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be like the, I don't know, like the X-Men side-scroller.

389
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:48,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like the Avengers game or the X-Men game that was in arcades.

390
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,481
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll still be fun.

391
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:52,746
[SPEAKER_01]: With a much larger cast, it seems.

392
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:59,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be as big as that fucking Avenger Doomsday cast they announced this week?

393
00:31:59,047 --> 00:31:59,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, Jesus.

394
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:00,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

395
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:01,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even look.

396
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:02,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, did you?

397
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

398
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,892
[SPEAKER_11]: All you need to know, Alan Cumming is coming back as Nightcrawler.

399
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:07,133
[SPEAKER_11]: All you need to know.

400
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:13,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because what made me laugh is that, like, Tigerclaw was trying to post the entire cast list for the movie.

401
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:17,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And because we have some type of official Discord group,

402
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

403
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,961
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to, in order to have some status we have in Discord, we have to have some mod filter on.

404
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And the mod filter rejected Tigerclaw's post like three times.

405
00:32:26,722 --> 00:32:29,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure he couldn't figure out, like, I'm not swearing in this.

406
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what is rejecting this post?

407
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,763
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because he was trying to put the word coming.

408
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:42,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Alan Cumming is coming back as Nightcrawler.

409
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:47,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to rethink my entire life choices now.

410
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:48,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

411
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so... I realize this is outside video games, but I just need us all to take a minute to appreciate Alan Cumming.

412
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:57,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we all take a minute to appreciate Alan Cumming?

413
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:02,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, like, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, hello, one of the best.

414
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:10,362
[SPEAKER_11]: The Traitors, which literally, if you're going to watch any reality TV show made in the last 10 years...

415
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:34,451
[SPEAKER_11]: you should watch the traitors it's fucking incredible television and 99% of that is because of Alan Cumming there is a reason he somebody finally dethroned RuPaul as best game show host and that was Alan Cumming he is incredible on that show okay I stopped to look over the cast and I mean I knew about about Downey being Dr. Doom but still oh yeah this is actually pretty it's

416
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm officially happy.

417
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:39,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm officially happy.

418
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:03,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

419
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:05,365
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, all right.

420
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:06,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel beat him up.

421
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:06,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

422
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:08,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

423
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:10,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, a couple more things.

424
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

425
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

426
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,730
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Loki.

427
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Because chat comments derailed me yet again.

428
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:17,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat put, everyone is here.

429
00:34:18,215 --> 00:34:18,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to see.

430
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:20,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the meme I need.

431
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to see the Marvel Doomsday cast right there.

432
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:27,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I need that Sakurai meme where he says, never ask me for anything ever again.

433
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:27,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

434
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:35,104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

435
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:35,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry, Loki.

436
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:36,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean it this time.

437
00:34:38,026 --> 00:34:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we had a couple more things that were announced.

438
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of those, of course, was Tomodachi Life Living the Dream.

439
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:50,494
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the game I was thinking about when we were talking about the Tomodachi thing before.

440
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:57,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one's the weird me game that's coming out next year, which probably is a switch.

441
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember this on the DS?

442
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:58,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

443
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,621
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

444
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:05,962
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little bit controversial because you couldn't have a same-sex relationship in the game.

445
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:11,063
[SPEAKER_11]: It got a lot of controversy for that, and I think, you know, some of us were like, well, fuck that game then.

446
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:17,445
[SPEAKER_11]: But it kind of became a little bit of an underground classic, and a lot of memes were made out of that game.

447
00:35:17,945 --> 00:35:21,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I just remember... Now I have to find it.

448
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:22,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to find it.

449
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:23,026
[SPEAKER_11]: It's too good.

450
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:27,167
[SPEAKER_11]: There are these YouTubes of, like, the characters singing...

451
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:35,607
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make your characters sing with all these original lyrics and things like that, which is great.

452
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:44,118
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, even the trailer kind of had one of those memes with the big face that was like, do you want to talk?

453
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:44,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Like,

454
00:35:45,539 --> 00:36:07,164
[SPEAKER_11]: that was really funny I think that game is really supposed to be like the meme game but this is the meme I was thinking of is that it's this and you're going to hear a little bit of audio that comes through this game and it's I Don't Know Her and it's Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj singing

455
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:14,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know her.

456
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:15,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, trust me.

457
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:16,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me.

458
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:16,663
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

459
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:17,704
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

460
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Look up the video.

461
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Look up the video.

462
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,047
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll laugh.

463
00:36:23,587 --> 00:36:24,127
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll chuckle.

464
00:36:24,787 --> 00:36:25,728
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll lightly teehee.

465
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, we're getting Meme Generator 2.0.

466
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:46,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and then the last piece of news was that they were going to be launching another app called Nintendo Today, which keeps you up to date with all the Nintendo news, including a big bombshell that they dropped in that, but we'll talk about that later.

467
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:50,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so well, but it also shows that this is Nintendo's attempt.

468
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:55,517
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an interesting way to take the Nintendo Direct concept one step further.

469
00:36:56,177 --> 00:37:01,600
[SPEAKER_11]: What if Nintendo, instead of waiting for that Direct, could send you a push notification to tell you the news?

470
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:16,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, you know, for as much shit as Nintendo gets for not being very clue-filled when it comes to being online, and rightfully so, this does seem like a very forward-thinking type of thing, if they can compel people to install that app.

471
00:37:17,904 --> 00:37:36,788
[SPEAKER_11]: which I'm not sure the calendar well actually no the calendar thing is kind of cute because you can turn those into widgets at least on Apple and I'm assuming Google's the same thing so on Apple you know how Apple has like the widgets on the screen and stuff you can actually have like a Nintendo branded widget that you can like have your calendar with that

472
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,105
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be cute for some people.

473
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:46,488
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't really care about branded stuff or seeing Animal Crossing characters all over your phone, then whatever.

474
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:47,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You're probably not going to care.

475
00:37:47,329 --> 00:38:03,957
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a little something to make a little widget for your home screen and now get some of these announcements and things pushed to you, which Nintendo utilized the day after they announced this to get people to install it on their phones so people could be like, oh shit, Nintendo's going to drop bombshells with this thing.

476
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:22,464
[SPEAKER_11]: so I'm very curious to see what happens after next week with the Switch 2 announcements and what sort of things get pushed out in that app so I mean it's free I had no problem installing Nintendo today your phone your business install what you want but free is a great price free 99 yep

477
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:31,789
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, the Tamodachi Life announcement, also a big TikTok meme.

478
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:36,094
[SPEAKER_11]: People losing their fucking mind over that game, which I did not realize that game.

479
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:45,644
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think, I feel like the people I'm seeing losing their mind are all of a certain age where they were like probably like 11, 12 years old when that game first came out.

480
00:38:46,244 --> 00:38:50,549
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is like a huge deal, you know, because I'm sure that game was all around them.

481
00:38:50,749 --> 00:38:53,570
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

482
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:19,277
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't want to start the show during the ads.

483
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:26,059
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do that to drop the pre-roll so people can jump right into our show at the beginning without Twitch forcing ads on you.

484
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:26,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me.

485
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,780
[SPEAKER_11]: There's reasons for all this.

486
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have what's called the cat roll, which shows all of our different cats.

487
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:34,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we've been open to adding other pets to it too.

488
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:35,642
[SPEAKER_11]: But for right now, it's only cats.

489
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:43,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's current and past because Mr. Smush is in it and Midna and Shermie is in it.

490
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:43,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

491
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:45,826
[SPEAKER_11]: There might even be a Sanrio picture.

492
00:39:46,246 --> 00:39:47,567
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have all the cats.

493
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:53,510
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's one picture in there that's like DarkSakura is me like falling asleep on the cat.

494
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's either the native 3D photo thing or that's from the original Tomodachi life.

495
00:39:58,973 --> 00:40:01,814
[SPEAKER_01]: That is from – that actually has nothing to do with it.

496
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:06,997
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from – what was that me thing on iPhone?

497
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:07,357
Oh.

498
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:09,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Miitopia!

499
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:10,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

500
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:12,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Miitomo.

501
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot all about that.

502
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:15,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shit.

503
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:16,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Pwned.

504
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:17,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Pwned.

505
00:40:17,871 --> 00:40:18,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, never mind.

506
00:40:19,692 --> 00:40:21,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was a Tomodachi Life thing.

507
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:23,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never played Tomodachi Life.

508
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:24,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

509
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:27,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

510
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:28,381
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

511
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:29,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what that was.

512
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm hoping this one will be good.

513
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:37,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as the relationships thing goes, it's, you know, in 2025, we've made some fucking progress in that department.

514
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:44,689
[SPEAKER_11]: So Nintendo doesn't fuck that up and make it a controversy in 2025 because love has no boundaries.

515
00:40:44,989 --> 00:40:48,651
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think most decent people know that now in 2025.

516
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,152
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't figured that out, I don't know how to explain it to you any further.

517
00:40:52,892 --> 00:40:54,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see what happens with this game.

518
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:55,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully it's going to be a lot of fun.

519
00:40:57,742 --> 00:40:58,943
[SPEAKER_11]: But the preview was really funny.

520
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:04,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you notice in the preview, like it comes up, it shows the beach and everybody goes, animal crossing, but it's not.

521
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:08,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the next shot is a me sleeping on the chair.

522
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:11,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And you might miss this the first time you watch the trailer.

523
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:23,685
[SPEAKER_11]: If you missed it, go back and watch because right before it fades into the next scene, the me that's asleep in the chair makes a little sound, a little poot sound and a little cloud comes out of their butt.

524
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so silly, but it's hilarious.

525
00:41:29,365 --> 00:41:32,830
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's like your first clue that this is Tomodachi Life.

526
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, all right.

527
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:38,124
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

528
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of games.

529
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:42,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

530
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:45,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike Defton chat says, yeah, the beach scene threw me for a loop.

531
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:46,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Thought it was Animal Crossing.

532
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:50,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, reasonable guess, reasonable expectations.

533
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:56,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like that is going to be a sure thing for Switch 2, whether now or next year, like Animal Crossing is going to happen.

534
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,712
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, the fart got me like, what?

535
00:41:58,912 --> 00:41:59,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's funny.

536
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:00,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

537
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:01,093
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

538
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:03,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Farting or not, let's talk about our gaming week.

539
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Some types of games we have been playing this week.

540
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:07,876
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, how was your pooting week?

541
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear lord.

542
00:42:11,658 --> 00:42:12,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a very busy week.

543
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,602
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have played a lot of Bellatro.

544
00:42:17,742 --> 00:42:22,004
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my fill-in-the-time stuff, you know?

545
00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:28,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing my Fruit Mountain game again and finally broke...

546
00:42:29,972 --> 00:42:56,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been stuck at like the most I've gotten was like around the 4,000 point range and I broke 7,000 points and the next best I was able to get is over 5,000 so I'm getting a little bit better at it I also of course played Dead by Daylight I've played Palia I've played some Dragon Age, the Veil Guard I've played Monster Hunter Wilds which I really like the game but it makes me motion sick and I still hate the controls

547
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting better at it, though.

548
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:00,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting better at it.

549
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:12,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I mean, I'm not, I kind of want to do something different, and I'm still debating my retro night if I'm going to do Wonder Project J or Marvelous.

550
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,698
[SPEAKER_01]: So, suggestions would be nice.

551
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,500
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, yeah.

552
00:43:19,561 --> 00:43:20,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, cool.

553
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:21,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Loki.

554
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:22,783
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of World Cup today.

555
00:43:23,844 --> 00:43:24,504
[SPEAKER_01]: World Cup soccer.

556
00:43:24,584 --> 00:43:26,645
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem with pinball.

557
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:28,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, how was your game of the week?

558
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much just Minecraft as usual.

559
00:43:32,891 --> 00:43:33,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We had

560
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,045
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work that I've been doing on like episodes.

561
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've put out fourth week in a row now.

562
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:43,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know how long that's going to continue on.

563
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:49,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And then still have working on Storage Room, which is going to be the next episode.

564
00:43:50,234 --> 00:43:51,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bellatro.

565
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:53,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Played a little bit of Bellatro as well.

566
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:59,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Still trying to get all the chips in one of the specific card sets just to...

567
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:01,423
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

568
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:18,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta check that out myself.

569
00:44:36,701 --> 00:44:37,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm inside your mind.

570
00:44:37,582 --> 00:44:37,883
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the

571
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:57,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Best puzzle games ever.

572
00:44:57,365 --> 00:45:00,988
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a reason why they let him do Tetris, him being Mizuguchi.

573
00:45:01,948 --> 00:45:02,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous is just so good.

574
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:07,673
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I was playing like the Switch version or, you know, the re-release of the original on the Switch a couple years ago.

575
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:09,354
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fun.

576
00:45:09,414 --> 00:45:11,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just like random retro games.

577
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:14,057
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been, you know, going down a random retro rabbit hole.

578
00:45:14,818 --> 00:45:16,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I was playing some of Super Mario World the other day.

579
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:17,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

580
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:18,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

581
00:45:19,622 --> 00:45:20,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the best games ever made.

582
00:45:21,043 --> 00:45:21,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wouldn't I play it?

583
00:45:22,524 --> 00:45:22,644
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

584
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:33,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I do need to get cracking on some more recent games, but when you have all the retro games to catch up on, you know, it doesn't matter when the game was made.

585
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,096
[SPEAKER_11]: A good game is a good game.

586
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's what it is.

587
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:40,598
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's move on to some more stories for this week.

588
00:45:41,399 --> 00:45:42,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, we'll start with you.

589
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:44,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Chance Launch Rumors

590
00:46:03,383 --> 00:46:22,295
[SPEAKER_02]: now this is something that I would say that we floated as a possibility based off of the time frame from the original Switch launch which they announced the Switch back in I think January and then launched it in March so now if they're doing like the official unveil in April it you know

591
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,371
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

592
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:54,472
[SPEAKER_02]: They are planning on a June release with a multi-phase rollout that would see the release strategy around Switch 2 games shift from first party to third party as the year progresses, but basically launching with a lot more first party games first.

593
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,575
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very similar to the original Switch's strategy.

594
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:01,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It was making sure that there was something coming out every month, even if it was third party.

595
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:07,224
[SPEAKER_11]: So just like, I want to say Mario and Rabbids early on was like a flagship title, even though it was an Ubisoft game and not a Nintendo game.

596
00:47:07,645 --> 00:47:16,493
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, there's a lot, you know, if you are to believe Nintendo's, if it ain't broke, don't fix it method of launching this system, that makes a lot of sense.

597
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:16,853
[SPEAKER_11]: And I...

598
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:19,575
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tempering my expectations with June.

599
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I hope it's June.

600
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:22,657
[SPEAKER_11]: June makes a lot of sense.

601
00:47:22,877 --> 00:47:26,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right when the kiddos are getting out of school or even the college kids are getting out of school.

602
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,502
[SPEAKER_11]: It is before the end of the fiscal year, so they can really bump the numbers.

603
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And they still would get a holiday to get through.

604
00:47:33,144 --> 00:47:35,466
[SPEAKER_11]: So a lot with June makes sense.

605
00:47:36,326 --> 00:47:40,912
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, I don't want to set June as an expectation.

606
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:46,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be fully aware that Nintendo very well could come out and say, coming holiday 2025.

607
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,763
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's where you should put your expectation.

608
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:53,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that way, if they say June, yay, you're pleasantly surprised.

609
00:47:54,448 --> 00:47:55,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

610
00:47:56,111 --> 00:48:03,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with that, there's a rumor that there may be some hints that Switch 2 upgrades for older games might be a thing.

611
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:07,549
[SPEAKER_02]: According to some of the fine print that was out...

612
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about the virtual card system.

613
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:19,506
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the Nintendo Switch exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 edition games can only be loaded in Nintendo Switch 2 systems.

614
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:24,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nintendo Switch 2 edition games and exclusive games.

615
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:31,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like that you could have a version that there's multiple versions of said game.

616
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:33,250
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

617
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:53,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they did with the PlayStation and I think even like some of the Xbox stuff.

618
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:56,367
[SPEAKER_02]: But PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 had that stuff.

619
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm of a few mindsets about this.

620
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:05,774
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as they make the performance enhancements worth the price, I'm okay with an upgrade price if I already owned it on Switch.

621
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:17,843
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also fully realize this would leave room for, let's say, Metroid Prime 4 on the original Switch is going to be $59.99, which was the price of games on the PlayStation 4 a while ago, or

622
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,385
[SPEAKER_11]: or even, you know, a while ago in games.

623
00:49:20,465 --> 00:49:27,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the addition on the Switch 2 is $69.99, which is more in line with the price of current games on other consoles.

624
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,854
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe the performance enhancements will justify that bump.

625
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:37,979
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I don't want to see is that I have to rebuy, like that $10 upgrade or whatever better be a thing.

626
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:43,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if I have to rebuy things like Pokemon Legends to get them to run better, I probably just won't.

627
00:49:43,963 --> 00:50:04,982
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's going to be really disappointing because that's some of the thing that is anticipating me most about this system is being able to play things like Pokemon Legends and especially Pokemon Scarlet Violet which badly needed better hardware on better hardware so let's see but also I think something to keep in mind

628
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,504
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't necessarily limited to Nintendo's first party.

629
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:13,807
[SPEAKER_11]: I absolutely believe there will be third-party games that will put out Nintendo Switch 2 editions of their games.

630
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:17,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one on the list, I would say Hello Games' No Man's Sky.

631
00:50:18,129 --> 00:50:21,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Garen fucking T, there's going to be a Switch 2 version of that game.

632
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:22,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Why the fuck wouldn't there be?

633
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It literally releases on every other system.

634
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:28,855
[SPEAKER_11]: You can expect there will be a No Man's Sky release on Switch 2.

635
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:34,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the question is, will they charge you again for it, or will they give you a free upgrade?

636
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:35,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Just so you know,

637
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:39,382
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a free upgrade if you had it on PS4 and then you put that PS4 in the PS5.

638
00:50:39,763 --> 00:50:41,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be kind of the model I'd be expecting.

639
00:50:41,845 --> 00:50:43,607
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, we'll see.

640
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:49,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how the Nintendo system will mess things up, but it'll hurt sales, I think.

641
00:50:50,935 --> 00:50:55,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I should say it's not going to inflate sales to make people buy that thing full price all over again.

642
00:50:56,824 --> 00:51:03,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Another third-party game I would fully expect to see, Diablo 4, which I actually don't think had a release on the original Switch.

643
00:51:03,071 --> 00:51:04,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Diablo 4 is on the Switch.

644
00:51:05,053 --> 00:51:13,241
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think some of these launch titles are going to be filling out the plate of things that got skipped over on Nintendo because the system wasn't good enough.

645
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:15,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Diablo 4, Final Fantasy XIV.

646
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:19,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XV and XVI while we're at it.

647
00:51:20,046 --> 00:51:25,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's going to be a lot of gap filling, but I just hope Nintendo isn't relying on that.

648
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:31,391
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to be enough to let those types of third-party games carry your system forever.

649
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:33,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe for a few months, but not for forever.

650
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:38,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they need to be in the situation of the Wii U, essentially.

651
00:51:38,374 --> 00:51:39,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

652
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:46,122
[SPEAKER_11]: So they need to not do the Wii, like, re-releases of old-ass games are not going to carry your system.

653
00:51:46,222 --> 00:51:52,889
[SPEAKER_11]: But, hell yeah, there's going to be people that will buy Diablo 4 when it's portable, or any of those games I named that you can play on Switch 2.

654
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:54,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we'll see.

655
00:51:58,598 --> 00:51:59,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Very exciting.

656
00:51:59,259 --> 00:51:59,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

657
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:00,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting to see.

658
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've only got a couple more days to wait.

659
00:52:02,261 --> 00:52:02,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

660
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It's weird to think in seven days we'll finally know.

661
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:09,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, less than seven days, but we'll be back here in seven days when we finally know.

662
00:52:09,706 --> 00:52:14,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Although maybe we need to do an emergency stream that night of the announcements to...

663
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:18,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Decompress all that stuff.

664
00:52:18,486 --> 00:52:18,866
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

665
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:19,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

666
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:38,017
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, it wasn't reported by Deadline, like a Hollywood industry thing.

667
00:52:38,057 --> 00:52:40,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't reported by a video game blog.

668
00:52:40,538 --> 00:52:51,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo decided to put that information out themselves with a very quick, I wouldn't even call it teaser trailer, I would call it logo, because it was like a logo display and then the date.

669
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:55,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And the date of the Zelda movie is March 26th, 2027.

670
00:52:57,143 --> 00:52:58,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have two years to wait.

671
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:01,604
[SPEAKER_11]: In two years, you will see a Zelda movie, if you want to.

672
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:08,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there are some more rumors that have kind of followed up since then on this movie.

673
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:15,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, that it's going to be a trilogy and that they are locking in the principal actors who have apparently already been cast.

674
00:53:15,494 --> 00:53:25,602
[SPEAKER_11]: They are locking in the principal actors between, I think it's Link, Zelda, Impa, and like one other character I think are going to be locked in for a six year, three movie deal.

675
00:53:26,043 --> 00:53:27,404
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to have to do all the movies.

676
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:49,077
[SPEAKER_11]: and that this film is going to start shooting in New Zealand this winter which our winter is their summer so if we talk about a November shooting it'll be it'll be beautiful weather down in New Zealand New Zealand of course being where they shot the Lord of the Rings movies which were infamously well known for just how fucking gorgeous the scenery was and I mean

677
00:53:50,663 --> 00:53:54,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, in many ways, I think this movie has the potential to be huge.

678
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:56,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I think locking him into a trilogy is a smart idea.

679
00:53:57,388 --> 00:54:01,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this movie does stand to do very well as long as the script doesn't suck.

680
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God, I hope the script doesn't suck.

681
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:05,073
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Mario movie was cool.

682
00:54:05,253 --> 00:54:05,773
[SPEAKER_11]: It was fine.

683
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:10,736
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, any problem... This is a live-action movie instead of an animated movie.

684
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:15,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, so there's a lot that could go wrong, but there's a lot that could go right.

685
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's interesting that there are these comparisons to Lord of the Rings because, honestly,

686
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:24,206
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'll probably get hazed for this comment, but I'm going to own it.

687
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:26,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is like a millennial Lord of the Rings.

688
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:27,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do.

689
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:34,073
[SPEAKER_11]: By the time this movie actually hits theaters, think about it.

690
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:40,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Those of us, and I'm pointing at us, maybe we're more Gen X, Zillennial, whatever, but we're going to be

691
00:54:41,898 --> 00:55:08,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Push in 50 if not in our 50s by the time these movies finally hit theaters and most a lot of our friendos will be taking their kids this will be a whole family thing because it's like you grew up with the modern Zelda games and I grew up with the old school Zelda games and we're coming together to see the Zelda like it's instead of growing up with the books we all grew up with the games and this is going to be like a huge moment in pop culture I really do think again please

692
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be a shitty movie.

693
00:55:10,781 --> 00:55:12,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I don't know how else to put it.

694
00:55:12,662 --> 00:55:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm really putting my faith in that the Mario movie shows that they can do good enough.

695
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:22,927
[SPEAKER_11]: But like, I don't want to get too wacky talking.

696
00:55:23,327 --> 00:55:28,089
[SPEAKER_11]: This has the potential to be like an Oscar caliber type of movie if they don't fuck it up.

697
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,350
[SPEAKER_11]: It has the potential to be that good.

698
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:33,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's going to mean that much to a lot of people.

699
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:35,214
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S

700
00:55:52,777 --> 00:56:19,399
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe second unit type of stuff especially if there are like maybe snow type scenes in it because we don't really know what they're doing but I don't think they will film anything until they announce the principles because there will be leaks otherwise and everybody wants control over this information so yeah I would say second yeah b-roll stuff second unit maybe that stuff could already be being made sure I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility but things with actual actors probably not um

701
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:24,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Tigerclaw says the movies could be adapting the first three games.

702
00:56:25,405 --> 00:56:28,288
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot it could be doing, and we don't know.

703
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:30,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Zelda timeline is very complicated.

704
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:34,975
[SPEAKER_11]: And quite honest, I honestly think they're gonna pull...

705
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:41,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be like the Oz stuff, like Return to Oz.

706
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:46,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Return to Oz pulled from two books to sort of create one story, for better or for worse.

707
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:48,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Not everybody cared for that movie.

708
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But I feel it's a similar thing.

709
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:52,315
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like 20-something Oz books.

710
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:53,995
[SPEAKER_11]: There's 20-something Zelda games.

711
00:56:54,115 --> 00:57:01,616
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna pull a little from column A and a little from column B, but they're gonna have to make one story out of multiple things.

712
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:03,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think they could do it.

713
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:04,257
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see what happens.

714
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:09,578
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be or it might be like a completely original type of idea that also exists in the same timeline.

715
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:11,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's a lot of ways to do it.

716
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:11,859
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

717
00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:13,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

718
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:17,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And Quest Buster says talks about the New Zealand filming and says, let's go Lord of the Ring fans.

719
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:27,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, if you're in New Zealand now, now your tourism is going to be Lord of the Rings visiting and Zelda visiting if the movie is good.

720
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:32,804
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I'm in New Zealand, I'm fucking getting out the confetti cannons right now for my tourism industry.

721
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

722
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: TigerClaw in chat says, do the Zelda movies based on the original games.

723
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:41,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Then if they're successful, the sequels would have to be based on the 3D Zelda games.

724
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:42,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Every game is a rehash.

725
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,811
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to rescue the princess in each one.

726
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:47,294
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why I don't think it's going to just one for one the movies.

727
00:57:47,454 --> 00:57:53,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would not expect the rescue the princess trope to translate very well into the movies.

728
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Sheik will exist in the movies.

729
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:57,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I will bet the farm on that.

730
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Sheik will exist in the movies.

731
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:04,209
[SPEAKER_11]: because they're not gonna go with the damsel in distress trope for the movies.

732
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:08,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but she was hardly a damsel in distress in Tears of the Kingdom.

733
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:15,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so there's gonna be, they're gonna incorporate a little from column A and a little from column B to well round out these characters.

734
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:23,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, just like they did in the Mario movie and instead they flipped the script and Luigi was the damsel in distress, so to speak.

735
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:26,378
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a little different than that, but they flipped the script.

736
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:27,299
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

737
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:54,756
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of armchair critics with this, and I'm going to tell you, and I made a bleat on Blue Sky about this.

738
00:58:55,557 --> 00:59:04,422
[SPEAKER_11]: The day that that trailer comes out for the Zelda movie, I'm logging the fuck off because fans are going to be insufferable when that trailer comes out.

739
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:31,679
[SPEAKER_11]: present company included, myself fans are going to be insufferable when that trailer comes out because everybody is going to be nitpicking every little frame there's going to be 3 hour YouTubes there's going to be live reacts it's all going to be there and it's going to be insufferable but I think what could be interesting is that Nintendo could roll out that trailer within the Nintendo Today app first

740
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:39,665
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not to say it won't get copy-posted onto YouTube and all the other places, but Nintendo has the ability to put out that trailer on their Today app first.

741
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:40,827
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

742
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:43,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, enough on that.

743
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:45,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a release date.

744
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:52,110
[SPEAKER_11]: But the reality, like for me, this release date is like reality that these movies are happening.

745
00:59:52,471 --> 00:59:54,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not going to be stuck in development hell.

746
00:59:55,172 --> 01:00:00,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the only thing that could go wrong now is that it's a Warner Brothers movie that gets hosed to be a tax write-off.

747
01:00:00,214 --> 01:00:01,895
[SPEAKER_11]: But thankfully it's not a Warner Brothers movie.

748
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:04,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So... It's a Sony movie.

749
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:04,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Sony, yeah.

750
01:00:04,956 --> 01:00:07,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with any Sony movies.

751
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

752
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:10,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're just going to hope that doesn't happen.

753
01:00:11,262 --> 01:00:16,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, they ought to be contractually obliged with Nintendo to actually release the movie.

754
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, we'll see what happens.

755
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:19,090
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

756
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:24,917
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more news in the saga of Ubisoft.

757
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:26,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, them.

758
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:45,678
[SPEAKER_01]: They have announced on this past Thursday that they are creating a new gaming subsidiary in conjunction with Tencent, investing $1.25 billion into it.

759
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:54,403
[SPEAKER_01]: The subsidiary will take care of Ubisoft's longest, best-known brands of Assassin's Creed, Far Cry,

760
01:00:55,023 --> 01:01:06,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow Six, and that actually boosted their shares by like 10.3% just after the announcement.

761
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:08,228
[SPEAKER_01]: This showed up on Friday.

762
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:17,651
[SPEAKER_01]: But in their press release, they said, and I quote, that it will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platformed.

763
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:35,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features.

764
01:01:36,587 --> 01:01:42,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So... The investment...

765
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:50,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the new subsidiary is valued, I keep in mind this comes from a European source, at 4 billion euros.

766
01:01:51,784 --> 01:02:02,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're thinking that it could quadruple their sales from this range to much further on down the line.

767
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:03,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

768
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:30,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this comes from being speculated from a potential sale of a company to now this and Bloomberg did report earlier that they were going to be looking into bringing in external investments in a new entity and I guess this is what it is I mean who knows we'll see what happens because of it

769
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:35,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like both could be true still.

770
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is priming the rest of Ubisoft to get sold.

771
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,251
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I feel like this is.

772
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't entirely think so.

773
01:02:43,272 --> 01:02:43,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair.

774
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:46,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a pride issue on the line for this too.

775
01:02:48,693 --> 01:02:51,174
[SPEAKER_11]: With the Gamon family being direct investors in this whole thing?

776
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:51,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly.

777
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:52,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

778
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:52,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

779
01:02:54,738 --> 01:03:18,951
[SPEAKER_11]: but I don't know, I can't help but feel like this is the first step, and it's probably a pessimist with everything else that's been going on in the industry the last few years, and you know, I would prefer that you're correct, DarkSakura, but I just can't feel I can't help but feel like this is just priming the rest of Ubisoft to be sold but we'll see that's true alright, well something else selling right now not things GameStop, right?

780
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:24,414
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, promising to sell eventually, GameStop

781
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:46,880
[SPEAKER_02]: you know i thought it's like if they can't do it with a super hyper inflated evaluation then how are they going to do it at all well they're gonna put all their money that they can into uh bitcoin and roll it all on bitcoin 1.3 billion dollars on bitcoin and how early 2024 of them

782
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:51,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

783
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:54,543
[SPEAKER_02]: They have $4 billion in cash reserves still.

784
01:03:55,304 --> 01:03:57,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to put it in Bitcoin.

785
01:03:58,645 --> 01:04:04,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it says also, you know, basically that the cryptocurrency was trading at $87,000.

786
01:04:05,086 --> 01:04:09,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, of course, peaked at $105,000.

787
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,048
[SPEAKER_02]: No possible way it could crash.

788
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:14,009
[SPEAKER_02]: No possible way.

789
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:16,169
[SPEAKER_02]: This seems like a very safe bet.

790
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

791
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know, man.

792
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised they're still around, honestly.

793
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I am shocked GameStop's still in business.

794
01:04:28,946 --> 01:04:29,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to keep it real.

795
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:31,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I am shocked that that store is still in business.

796
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:37,791
[SPEAKER_11]: As we're watching Sears around the nation go under, what's the latest one that they started closing all the stores?

797
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:39,572
[SPEAKER_11]: JC Macy's.

798
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:42,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Macy's, that's right, because our big Macy's here in Sacramento.

799
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:44,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Macy's, we just had Joanne's.

800
01:04:44,815 --> 01:04:45,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Joanne's, yes.

801
01:04:46,556 --> 01:05:04,089
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the other big one so yeah this is just like I'm I'm kind of shocked the GameStop is like holding on to be honest um you know and again I I realize there's a very a lot there's a lot of hard-working people on the front line and this is a lot of like people's first job experience yeah and like

802
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:07,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, I am sorry to be such a pessimist.

803
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:13,220
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not about you hardworking folks and all about the way these companies are mismanaged.

804
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And nobody will tell you more about how these companies are mismanaged than those people on the front line.

805
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:19,003
[SPEAKER_02]: No, exactly.

806
01:05:19,063 --> 01:05:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.

807
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:26,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's not like, you know, I mean, back in the day, we used to complain about like pushing subscriptions and stuff like that.

808
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:30,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we know that it's not the employee that's meaning to do that.

809
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:38,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's pressure from higher ups to turn a profit in what is not a very profitable industry, at least resale wise, you know.

810
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:42,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get it now with the Funko stuff that they're doing that.

811
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:44,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, honestly, like I look at.

812
01:05:45,243 --> 01:05:46,624
[SPEAKER_02]: other game stores out there.

813
01:05:46,664 --> 01:05:52,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, I went to the local retro game store yesterday to just check out.

814
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:52,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

815
01:05:52,988 --> 01:05:53,949
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a couple of them now.

816
01:05:54,629 --> 01:05:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Fire and Ice.

817
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:56,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been over there yet.

818
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:57,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go over there.

819
01:05:57,511 --> 01:06:03,955
[SPEAKER_02]: So Fire and Ice, they're right there by the old Cusar, but like Chuck E. Cheese, you know, and Citrus Heights.

820
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:11,400
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's I think it took over like the old Pier One or Cost Plus or something.

821
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there was a Pier One over there.

822
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,221
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
01:06:13,757 --> 01:06:14,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

824
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:19,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So they split it up between that and now it's like some freight tools place.

825
01:06:19,701 --> 01:06:20,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Harbor Freight, but something else.

826
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:21,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

827
01:06:21,522 --> 01:06:23,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so yeah, we went there.

828
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:25,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very nice store.

829
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:30,828
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like tons of like new in-box retro games if you want to pay that kind of money.

830
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:31,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they have like

831
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:36,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice not-inbox retro games.

832
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:40,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell tons of, like, you know, magic and Pokemon cards and all that stuff.

833
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:43,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of, like, these cool signs that it looks like they custom make.

834
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:48,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, these giant, like, display signs you can put into your game rooms or whatever.

835
01:06:48,403 --> 01:06:49,865
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really nice laid-out store.

836
01:06:50,285 --> 01:06:52,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how a game store should be.

837
01:06:52,247 --> 01:06:54,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that is, like, kind of the heyday of...

838
01:06:55,029 --> 01:07:07,515
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop and stuff like that it's like it's just a nicely laid out clean store no Funko Pops I love that idea of combining like retro video games and even do they sell current video games too or is it just retro?

839
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, they have, like, PlayStation 4 games, and so I wouldn't be surprised if they had PlayStation 5 games, but it, I mean, it looked like everything.

840
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:23,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that they combined that with the concept of a physical game room and physical games, whether it be, like, the Pokemon cards or, you know, like, things you would have.

841
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:24,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And they play games there, too.

842
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because now I'm like, look, I've got all this room for signage here in my office.

843
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:31,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm like, oh, I should go over there and see what they've got.

844
01:07:31,493 --> 01:07:37,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I got, like, I will say, the retro one downtown, I can't remember their names, but the ones over on J Street downtown,

845
01:07:38,215 --> 01:07:41,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I did pick up a cool little... I'm pointing over here because it's on my wall over here.

846
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those... Game Over or something like that.

847
01:07:44,322 --> 01:07:47,645
[SPEAKER_11]: The box 3D box pixel art.

848
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:49,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Castlevania scene in 3D.

849
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:51,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And I looked for them again last time I was there.

850
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,772
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't have any, so I don't know if they just stopped...

851
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:55,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a shadow box.

852
01:07:55,692 --> 01:07:56,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like that.

853
01:07:57,493 --> 01:08:01,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, oh, I want to get more for other games, but they're gone from that store.

854
01:08:01,054 --> 01:08:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I can probably get them online somewhere, but there's something kind of fun about going in the store and seeing it for yourself, the quality in person and all of that.

855
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:09,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice.

856
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:21,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I was going to get stuff, but I was like, you know, I have a whole stack of Nintendo games here that I'm not playing, and I'm maybe looking at getting a retro emulation system type thing.

857
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: and like I don't really need to buy this but they were very nice it was a lot better than like going to the the flea market out on Folsom Boulevard where I mean they're selling they're trying to sell their whole inventory for like a million dollars and it was just like unorganized yeah

858
01:08:38,431 --> 01:08:39,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's who's selling.

859
01:08:40,472 --> 01:08:41,833
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one in Denios.

860
01:08:41,893 --> 01:08:44,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Trader Dan's is the one out in Denios.

861
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:46,836
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this is the other one.

862
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:53,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like dirty and it's like good luck finding anything because it was just a stack of cartridges half the labels rubbed off.

863
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:54,321
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like

864
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Be rude.

865
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:16,548
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

866
01:09:16,728 --> 01:09:20,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked like it felt in the weather.

867
01:09:21,913 --> 01:09:30,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just not... Even if you had the intention to go purchase something from them, good luck finding what you want.

868
01:09:30,241 --> 01:09:31,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like I said, it was...

869
01:09:32,103 --> 01:09:33,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Not organized at all.

870
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:35,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is all in alphabetical order.

871
01:09:35,324 --> 01:09:37,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They have clear, distinct sections for each of the things.

872
01:09:38,085 --> 01:09:41,666
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell retro games, they sell all the peripherals, all the stuff that you'd possibly need.

873
01:09:42,106 --> 01:09:49,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is very easy to find stuff, whereas that is just like someone took a bunch of them, just dumped it in a pile, maybe stacked it up, and that's it.

874
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:51,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, it was dirty and just gross.

875
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

876
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember... I'm going to do a tangent train for a minute.

877
01:09:56,022 --> 01:10:00,466
[SPEAKER_11]: My first job at a high school that I had was for a local video chain.

878
01:10:00,486 --> 01:10:02,927
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't exist anymore, so I'll say it was called Plaster TV Video.

879
01:10:02,947 --> 01:10:04,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you remember them, Loki?

880
01:10:04,469 --> 01:10:04,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

881
01:10:04,669 --> 01:10:05,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Plaster TV Video.

882
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,150
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I used to work.

883
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:12,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to work at their flagship store in Old Town Roseville many, many, many years ago, before most of you were born.

884
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:17,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing about that store is that the owners firmly believed...

885
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:20,861
[SPEAKER_11]: That the movie should not be organized.

886
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:25,224
[SPEAKER_11]: That they were out there by letter and by category.

887
01:10:25,724 --> 01:10:35,350
[SPEAKER_11]: But otherwise, and it was the type of thing you had to take the box, bring it to the counter, and then little old me would go find it in the back, which was completely alphabetized by number and categorized.

888
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:38,172
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very easy for me to find, but for you to find the movie.

889
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:41,654
[SPEAKER_11]: And then they would have just one section that was just clumped with new releases.

890
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:44,737
[SPEAKER_11]: These new releases, it's just go find them.

891
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:47,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And they firmly believed that was the way to do it because

892
01:10:48,939 --> 01:10:51,440
[SPEAKER_11]: That way people can find something new to watch.

893
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,380
[SPEAKER_11]: That was it.

894
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,421
[SPEAKER_11]: That was their big.

895
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: This is how people find something new to watch.

896
01:10:58,061 --> 01:11:02,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, somebody's coming in there going, do you have a copy of Heat with Val Kilmer?

897
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:05,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that was, you know, how many years ago I was working at this video store.

898
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:08,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, yes, I show we have one in inventory.

899
01:11:09,044 --> 01:11:09,564
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

900
01:11:10,144 --> 01:11:12,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go out and try to find the box.

901
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:15,165
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a there's a there's somebody returning.

902
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:17,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It is such a pain in the fucking ass anymore.

903
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, and the people would figure that out.

904
01:11:20,427 --> 01:11:23,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Just come to the counter and ask the kid behind the counter to find the damn thing for you.

905
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:25,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Annoying.

906
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:27,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, it was a decent job, though.

907
01:11:27,269 --> 01:11:30,890
[SPEAKER_11]: The people there were great, and I learned a lot in the short time that I worked there, but yeah.

908
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:36,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it, yeah, I don't know, like, why they would do that.

909
01:11:36,452 --> 01:11:41,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because obviously people are able to find other things in stores that are perfectly organized.

910
01:11:42,194 --> 01:11:43,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Also with this store.

911
01:11:44,706 --> 01:11:49,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see in chat, Bobby's like, I worked for Blockbuster and I'm sure people worked for Hollywood.

912
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:53,148
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, Placer TV had something that those chains didn't have.

913
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:56,169
[SPEAKER_11]: We had the top shelf movies.

914
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's nodding.

915
01:11:57,429 --> 01:12:04,111
[SPEAKER_11]: We had the top shelf movies, which means the movies that were on top of the shelf where the kids couldn't reach them.

916
01:12:04,371 --> 01:12:05,431
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't in a back room.

917
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,732
[SPEAKER_11]: They were on the top shelf where the kids couldn't reach them.

918
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:13,337
[SPEAKER_11]: and they were slightly bigger boxes.

919
01:12:13,737 --> 01:12:14,757
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, kids.

920
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:22,638
[SPEAKER_11]: We rented porn, which made more money than anything else in that store because porn releases never, never go old.

921
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:29,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will say I had the unique experience of renting porn to my friend's dad.

922
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,740
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the type of thing that is a memory that doesn't leave you.

923
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:38,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

924
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:42,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are your plans for tonight?

925
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:47,550
[SPEAKER_11]: In case any of my current friends are listening, not a friend I have talked to since grade school.

926
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:50,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So nobody that knows me now has to worry.

927
01:12:50,394 --> 01:12:52,757
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a friend I have not talked to since grade school.

928
01:12:52,777 --> 01:12:54,119
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

929
01:12:54,139 --> 01:12:54,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what?

930
01:12:56,279 --> 01:13:02,560
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in college in my dorm, we used to just find random porn and watch it for hilarity reasons.

931
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:07,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all of us, like a big group of people, just watching and riffing it the whole time.

932
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:09,401
[SPEAKER_11]: And look, look, and I'm not shaming.

933
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:11,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not shaming people that watch porn.

934
01:13:11,562 --> 01:13:13,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Like everybody's watched porn at some point in their life.

935
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not shaming porn.

936
01:13:15,723 --> 01:13:22,784
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just when you're 18 and still learning a lot about the world, it was a very eye-opening experience.

937
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:23,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all I have to say.

938
01:13:26,893 --> 01:13:30,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he didn't know who I was, and that was fine by me.

939
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, um...

940
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:38,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go back to the GameStop story and why they might be playing Katy Perry's The One That Got Away on loop this week.

941
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:45,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have news that the magazine that used to be a part of GameStop, Game Informer, is coming back.

942
01:13:46,641 --> 01:13:56,763
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, an announcement on the official Game Informer Twitter, which I don't know why any respectable organization is still using Twitter, but I'm going to get off that soapbox or we'll be here for five hours tonight.

943
01:13:57,523 --> 01:14:00,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Informer's official Twitter has said that the...

944
01:14:01,644 --> 01:14:29,498
[SPEAKER_11]: publication is uh you know it was was shutting down and all that and then now Game Informer is actually on its way back uh on the YouTube channel is actually I'm sorry the Twitter channel that's good I thought I thought Twitter was where they announced the comeback but it's actually YouTube where they announced the comeback there's a new YouTube that uh came out that says not only is Game Informer coming back but the entire team is also going to be returning with this nice

945
01:14:29,878 --> 01:14:37,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, my understanding, though, is that there's a little bit of an asterisk with this that has the concern of some people.

946
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:51,916
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently what's happening is that the company that is jump-starting this is one that was known for getting into the business with crypto and I think it was specifically NFT games.

947
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:56,279
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not to say they are still currently in that business, but...

948
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:04,063
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like a little bit of a stink, shall we say, that's hanging on that.

949
01:15:04,143 --> 01:15:15,489
[SPEAKER_11]: So Gunzilla Games, who developed Off the Grid, and Off the Grid was a free-to-play battle royale game that would have an NFT marketplace for purchasing and selling in-game items.

950
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:18,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's just a little bit of stank.

951
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:24,214
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do think we're at a place where the market has firmly rejected these type of games.

952
01:15:25,014 --> 01:15:30,838
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm also kind of like, I'm not going to play the morality police on this issue.

953
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm for people that walk the walk and talk the talk.

954
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:36,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's the thing.

955
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,383
[SPEAKER_11]: You brought back Game Informer, and you didn't just zombie the brand.

956
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:42,625
[SPEAKER_11]: You brought back the staff that made it happen.

957
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:44,826
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like every single one of them.

958
01:15:45,347 --> 01:15:46,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So, fine.

959
01:15:46,848 --> 01:15:49,630
[SPEAKER_11]: If you made that type of investment, I hope it pays off for you.

960
01:15:49,690 --> 01:16:03,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I would rather see that type of investment pay off for a company than the NFT, you know, all that garbage that we just don't... It was not going to be good for our industry and has been soundly rejected.

961
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:04,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

962
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

963
01:16:07,608 --> 01:16:09,288
[SPEAKER_11]: The Digital Archive is back.

964
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:10,228
[SPEAKER_11]: There's new articles.

965
01:16:10,268 --> 01:16:11,148
[SPEAKER_11]: There's new reviews.

966
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:14,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And the magazine will be revived later this year.

967
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:15,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's pretty exciting.

968
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And you won't have to walk into a GameStop to get it.

969
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:24,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Mike Defton Chat says, Crypto Bros are funding this and I really don't like that.

970
01:16:24,252 --> 01:16:28,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I just hope they let Game Informer run their stuff like they used to and keeps their hand away.

971
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:30,673
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where I'm at.

972
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:30,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Again,

973
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:41,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a more morally gray company would have bought the name and hired cheaper people to do it

974
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:47,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we're going to talk about companies doing wrong things, we should talk about companies doing right things.

975
01:16:48,036 --> 01:17:01,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think when the company hires the original staff and brings this back in a manner that I think we can all agree is the way we can bring it back, I'm willing to overlook the company's past mistakes as long as we stay on this positive road we're on.

976
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:06,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's stay on this positive journey together and everything will be cool.

977
01:17:08,544 --> 01:17:36,170
[SPEAKER_11]: but S. Joe and Hunter Matt says worries me that if the parent company feels they're not getting a return on the investment they'll force them to ram in the NFT crypto stuff which is now what GameStops ended up doing essentially but I mean the market has already rejected this the gaming gamer fans as a whole has rejected this and I know somebody's gonna DM me going but Rob what about that store marketplace but very few people are turning a profit off that stuff

978
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:41,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask some of our friends we used to podcast with how the NFT thing has gone for them.

979
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:52,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat points out nothing about the GI vault.

980
01:17:53,099 --> 01:17:54,159
[SPEAKER_11]: No, nothing about that either.

981
01:17:54,940 --> 01:18:00,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, DJ Ranma S says crypto bros are bringing back a magazine, bringing back the staff and doing something good.

982
01:18:00,762 --> 01:18:02,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel it failed to see the issue here.

983
01:18:02,183 --> 01:18:06,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we are hoping that our crypto bros have found a better path forward.

984
01:18:07,304 --> 01:18:30,718
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is to be celebrated all right uh let's move on yes I believe DarkSakura's next yeah and uh well it's another bit of layoff news because of course it is I mean who here likes Myst or or Riven

985
01:18:33,146 --> 01:18:33,726
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.

986
01:18:33,866 --> 01:18:33,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

987
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:36,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've never played all time class.

988
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:52,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Myst is like the I mean, it's it's one of it's always picked for these Hall of Fame's most influential, greatest of all time of its era for a reason, you know, and yeah.

989
01:18:52,455 --> 01:18:52,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

990
01:18:53,743 --> 01:18:57,925
[SPEAKER_01]: The developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff by half.

991
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:01,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, I mean, it is 12 people.

992
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:04,309
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is roughly half of their team.

993
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:12,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Because apparently they said they were forced into a tricky spot.

994
01:19:13,434 --> 01:19:19,742
[SPEAKER_01]: where they were not able to cover costs.

995
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:22,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to read.

996
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:31,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025.

997
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:40,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the past year, we have been ultra transparent with the entire Scion team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead.

998
01:19:41,646 --> 01:19:47,792
[SPEAKER_01]: While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was and is still deeply saddening for all of us.

999
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:49,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1000
01:19:49,273 --> 01:19:52,797
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done our best to pad the landing for those affected with severance packages.

1001
01:19:52,957 --> 01:19:57,021
[SPEAKER_01]: We would implore any fellow developers looking for world-class talent to reach out.

1002
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this actually seems pretty sincere.

1003
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:02,041
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it does.

1004
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:12,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think maybe because it is a smaller studio and as much as this news sucks, you feel a little bit more, let's say, humanity in this than a lot of the game layoff news we've had from larger corporations.

1005
01:20:12,984 --> 01:20:16,825
[SPEAKER_11]: So while this news sucks and I'm not going to sugarcoat that.

1006
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:21,448
[SPEAKER_11]: at least they have been fairly transparent throughout this process and so forth.

1007
01:20:21,508 --> 01:20:33,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, that's what we as fans who support these companies look for these companies to do is to, you know, keep doing that right thing for these people that they do unfortunately have to let go.

1008
01:20:33,976 --> 01:20:46,805
[SPEAKER_11]: But I understand, like, you know, Cyan, I believe the latest things they published were VR versions of Myst and Riven, which while that sounds really cool and I actually would like to try that because those games are epic,

1009
01:20:47,986 --> 01:20:50,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure maybe VR took off.

1010
01:20:50,289 --> 01:20:53,434
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that sounds like they kind of hedged some bets in VR.

1011
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:58,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is not me poo-pooing VR because I understand people are doing amazing things in VR.

1012
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:04,388
[SPEAKER_11]: But the reality is, it's not adopting, especially right now, amongst gamer fans.

1013
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:05,309
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

1014
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:42,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, more to the point of the layoffs, and Bobby pointed this out in chat, that their follow-up post had the 12 people listed and how to contact them for hiring.

1015
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:44,913
[SPEAKER_05]: With permission.

1016
01:21:45,113 --> 01:21:47,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly, they are doing their best for that.

1017
01:21:47,635 --> 01:21:50,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we're coming just for the first quarter of 2025.

1018
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:56,001
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about 1,200 game developers losing their jobs.

1019
01:21:56,722 --> 01:22:00,205
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming from about 14,600 in 2024 and 10,500 in 2023.

1020
01:22:00,245 --> 01:22:03,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that doesn't include people who might have been rehired or hired by other places.

1021
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just saying it's

1022
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:15,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.

1023
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:16,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's there.

1024
01:22:39,989 --> 01:23:06,517
[SPEAKER_11]: just you wait and that's why I'm worried about this Ghibli which without going down that whole rabbit hole that's what has me worried about this Ghiblification thing that's going on right now and how many people that don't really know the nuances of this are really buying into that that's a very dangerous thing that's happening if I I think this is not the sort of thing that would make Miyazaki happy

1025
01:23:07,541 --> 01:23:11,364
[SPEAKER_11]: No, in fact, he said as much in 2017 or something.

1026
01:23:11,424 --> 01:23:17,288
[SPEAKER_11]: He made a comment on the AI that was not complex because he's making the rounds again because people are attributing it as a current quote.

1027
01:23:17,348 --> 01:23:17,708
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

1028
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:21,450
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an old quote, but I'm sure his position has not changed.

1029
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:23,732
[SPEAKER_11]: It has only intensified after what happened this week.

1030
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:27,635
[SPEAKER_11]: I would not be surprised if there was legal action.

1031
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:31,017
[SPEAKER_11]: To me, that's going to have to happen.

1032
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:36,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Studio Ghibli kind of needs to sue OpenAI and that needs to play out.

1033
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:42,067
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clearly that they've trained it off of their material illegally.

1034
01:23:42,307 --> 01:23:45,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly, that's what happened.

1035
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:49,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you say this, it actually is...

1036
01:23:51,631 --> 01:23:58,494
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some experts saying that there is grounds to take legal action against OpenAI.

1037
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,916
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

1038
01:24:03,036 --> 01:24:07,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, hold on, I just read something about this.

1039
01:24:07,919 --> 01:24:09,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It was posted a couple days ago.

1040
01:24:12,176 --> 01:24:24,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The former general counsel at TV Channel Showtime and AI expert Rob Rosenberg, Ghibli may actually be able to take legal action against open AI over the situation, even though it is a complex question.

1041
01:24:24,664 --> 01:24:33,791
[SPEAKER_01]: This is related to the Lanham Act from 1946, having to do the primary federal statute governing trademark law in the U.S.,

1042
01:24:34,471 --> 01:24:50,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could argue that converting user photos to Ghibli style OpenAI is trading off the goodwill of Ghibli's trademarks and using Ghibli's identifiable style and leading to a likelihood of confusion among consumers that this function is endorsed or licensed by Studio Ghibli.

1043
01:24:52,485 --> 01:25:08,333
[SPEAKER_11]: S2 and Hunter Matt in chat says it may be a fight in court but it's worth the fight 100% this is how we need to redirect AI to stay in its fucking lane and as I've said time and time again AI great when it's a tool terrible when it's a replacement for art those are two very different things

1044
01:25:09,529 --> 01:25:18,634
[SPEAKER_01]: New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI as well, and they requested for the case to be thrown out, and a federal judge denied them.

1045
01:25:20,275 --> 01:25:26,558
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of big ones out there.

1046
01:25:26,678 --> 01:25:30,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Meta has been accused of illegally downloading pirated books to train AIs.

1047
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:32,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one's nice.

1048
01:25:33,202 --> 01:25:36,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how they're like, oh, well, we shouldn't be punished for all that stuff.

1049
01:25:37,603 --> 01:25:43,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were suing folks $100,000 for downloading 1MB3.

1050
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be sued to oblivion.

1051
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:49,287
[SPEAKER_11]: And fucking tired of the lack of accountability in this country.

1052
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:57,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also, though, point out that there is a cease and desist letter that's floating around from Studio Ghibli and it is false.

1053
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:58,150
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fake.

1054
01:25:59,691 --> 01:25:59,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1055
01:26:01,366 --> 01:26:06,650
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, it's not homage.

1056
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,451
[SPEAKER_01]: It is art theft.

1057
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:11,193
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to court somehow.

1058
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:17,618
[SPEAKER_11]: If the Ghibli thing doesn't because it gets complicated with international stuff, this will go to court one way or the other.

1059
01:26:17,778 --> 01:26:18,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Just you wait.

1060
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:20,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I will throw this out here, though.

1061
01:26:22,562 --> 01:26:29,567
[SPEAKER_01]: ChatGTP is blocking those AI-generated Ghibli art pieces.

1062
01:26:30,067 --> 01:26:30,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Quote art.

1063
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:32,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm, interesting.

1064
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:34,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there is that.

1065
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, not meaning to go off on the tangent there, but it is worth mentioning.

1066
01:26:40,115 --> 01:26:45,820
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's absolutely worth mentioning when you look at things from an industry perspective and why these layoffs happen.

1067
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:53,407
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, as much as this news sucks with Cyan, they're doing everything right for this difficult process.

1068
01:26:53,467 --> 01:26:58,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you look at these other big companies that just seem to have no heart whatsoever,

1069
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:00,612
[SPEAKER_11]: why they're laying people off, how they're laying people off.

1070
01:27:00,813 --> 01:27:02,213
[SPEAKER_11]: It's such a contrast.

1071
01:27:02,374 --> 01:27:06,796
[SPEAKER_11]: No wonder it's so ego-reducing in the industry.

1072
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:13,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you're going to want to look, by the way, back to those updates about Ghibli, look to NHK.

1073
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:20,184
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty much the ones who've been getting the quotes and the news on it directly from the company.

1074
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:22,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1075
01:27:22,385 --> 01:27:23,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on.

1076
01:27:23,246 --> 01:27:25,067
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go to another story from Loki.

1077
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:25,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1078
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:26,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1079
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:46,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So along the same lines of where, you know, some of the stuff in the industry is pivoting the wrong way, Sony has kind of done that in the past with some of this push to make a ton of live service games and then having to walk that all back after, of course, Concord completely bombed and everything.

1080
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had an interesting comment from ex-PlayStation boss Sean Layden saying,

1081
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1082
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:37,752
[SPEAKER_02]: all that's considered it seemed to be a good time to step down after 32 years at Sony so it sounds like they were pushing to move this into the live service stuff and it's just like I'm not inspired to make anything within that space it's kind of putting pressure on the creatives at the company so yep

1083
01:28:40,098 --> 01:28:40,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1084
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:43,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of live service stuff.

1085
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:43,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1086
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:50,400
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a heck of a way to kind of see what's coming and make moves appropriately.

1087
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder how many people are doing this because of AI.

1088
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:54,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting.

1089
01:28:56,501 --> 01:28:57,282
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting.

1090
01:28:58,022 --> 01:28:59,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what else to say about it, so I'm going to move on.

1091
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:06,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about the Multiverses developers, which unfortunately, as we all know, Multiverses has got the plug pulled, essentially.

1092
01:29:07,143 --> 01:29:08,304
[SPEAKER_11]: They're on their last season.

1093
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:16,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, Player First, which was the team behind Multiverses before, you know, Warner Brothers got to Warner Brothers.

1094
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:22,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they were going to be working on – this comes through a podcast.

1095
01:29:22,884 --> 01:29:27,608
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of these whole – once associated with Warner Brothers, San Diego and all this.

1096
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:30,510
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, the podcast was Sacred Symbols.

1097
01:29:31,071 --> 01:29:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know how much this is hearsay or direct knowledge, but I would believe this.

1098
01:29:36,215 --> 01:29:36,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1099
01:29:36,616 --> 01:29:36,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Mm-hmm.

1100
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:17,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, also the source on this podcast, the host Colin Moriarty for Sacred Symbols, said there was quite a lot of animosity internally from people that worked on the game, who felt it was profoundly unfair that their sister team, Player First, got to launch multiverses twice while they never got a shot to launch at all.

1101
01:30:18,057 --> 01:30:18,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, interesting.

1102
01:30:20,157 --> 01:30:39,298
[SPEAKER_11]: but it should be pointed out Mario Kart clones are nothing new and some of them have actually done very well I think we all kind of liked Sega's All-Star Racing I'm pretty sure they've had their own with the Adventure Time and stuff they had Cartoon Network Racing was a game years ago making something a little more Mario Kart 8 yeah

1103
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:46,484
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this, Warner Brothers and studios that are employed by Warner Brothers?

1104
01:30:46,624 --> 01:30:49,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop trying to copy everybody else's games and make your own original games.

1105
01:30:50,086 --> 01:30:52,808
[SPEAKER_02]: You wonder why you can't have a successful game.

1106
01:30:52,868 --> 01:30:55,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you're trying to crib off of everybody else.

1107
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up with something unique yourself.

1108
01:30:58,134 --> 01:30:59,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing for me.

1109
01:30:59,574 --> 01:31:00,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Multiverses wasn't bad.

1110
01:31:02,255 --> 01:31:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not bad, but it's clear where the inspiration's drawn from.

1111
01:31:07,877 --> 01:31:15,139
[SPEAKER_11]: We have Disney Speedstorm, which is the same thing, but it's Disney, and I think it's doing pretty well, and I see friends on Twitch that stream that.

1112
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:19,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I think DreamWorks has one, too, called All-Star Kart Racing, although I'm not sure.

1113
01:31:19,981 --> 01:31:21,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have the DreamWorks.

1114
01:31:21,521 --> 01:31:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty old by this point.

1115
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:29,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, you know, if it's true we're getting Mario Kart 9... Hey, Garfield Kart, let's not forget Garfield Kart.

1116
01:31:29,864 --> 01:31:32,805
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about Garfield Kart.

1117
01:31:33,506 --> 01:31:41,849
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's true we're getting Mario Kart 9 or 10, depending on where you count Mario Kart Tour with this or not, you know, with that being announced...

1118
01:31:42,769 --> 01:31:44,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost definitely next week.

1119
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:49,194
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have probably really taken the wins out of any type of sales of this sort of game.

1120
01:31:49,214 --> 01:31:57,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And honestly, it's something that Speedstorm and the others need to be aware of is that with a legit new Mario Kart title imminent, that's going to be huge.

1121
01:31:57,319 --> 01:32:00,561
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not to say you can't have more than one successful kart racing game.

1122
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:04,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the others that aren't live service games are cute.

1123
01:32:04,203 --> 01:32:08,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I was at a party where some friends were playing Crash Racing just the other day.

1124
01:32:08,927 --> 01:32:09,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Crash Racing?

1125
01:32:09,747 --> 01:32:12,589
[SPEAKER_02]: is great, Sonic, Sega, Racing, All-Stars.

1126
01:32:12,609 --> 01:32:16,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring me back Chocobo Racing without all that bullshit.

1127
01:32:18,554 --> 01:32:21,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be the addition, without all that bullshit addition.

1128
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:28,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I think technically the game I think exists is that now, but it's it's so it's too late, exactly.

1129
01:32:28,361 --> 01:32:29,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's like that's never coming back.

1130
01:32:29,822 --> 01:32:32,444
[SPEAKER_11]: That was our chance was that game and

1131
01:32:33,749 --> 01:32:33,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Womp.

1132
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:37,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess we have the Sonic thing to look forward to.

1133
01:32:37,695 --> 01:32:41,620
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, Mario Kart 9 or 10, which I'll finally know the actual name next week.

1134
01:32:42,561 --> 01:32:42,822
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1135
01:32:43,963 --> 01:32:50,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, while I think about upcoming games, DarkSakura is going to take a minute in our next segment to talk about old games.

1136
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:08,724
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1137
01:33:09,164 --> 01:33:11,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

1138
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:18,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And Jamie, with the Classic Game of the Week, you're on a roll with some bangers right now, some modern day classics.

1139
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,071
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming everything's turning 10 this month.

1140
01:33:22,341 --> 01:33:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I mean, I was a little bit just taken aback by this.

1141
01:33:27,505 --> 01:33:29,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this is 11 years we're looking at.

1142
01:33:29,886 --> 01:33:30,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, geez.

1143
01:33:30,847 --> 01:33:31,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1144
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:32,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel so old.

1145
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:33,689
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1146
01:33:33,749 --> 01:33:34,650
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the classic game?

1147
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:43,216
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the creator of the series can be very problematic, I did pick Five Nights at Freddy's.

1148
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a point-and-click survival horror game that was developed and published by Scott Cawthorn, where you play as a character named Mike Schmidt, who is a security guard at a pizzeria.

1149
01:33:58,668 --> 01:34:07,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has to basically guard the place and keep from being murdered by the animatronics that live there, or exist there, I should say.

1150
01:34:08,892 --> 01:34:09,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1151
01:34:10,253 --> 01:34:18,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, it was actually developed as a result of criticism.

1152
01:34:19,338 --> 01:34:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had created a game called Chipper and Son's Lumber Company.

1153
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:32,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And it said that even though it was supposed to be a family-friendly game, the characters were unintentionally frightening and had unnatural movement.

1154
01:34:32,303 --> 01:34:35,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, well, if that's what it is, then that's what we're doing.

1155
01:34:35,624 --> 01:34:43,367
[SPEAKER_01]: So six months it took using the Clickbait... Sorry, Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game engine.

1156
01:34:43,907 --> 01:34:47,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It was released on Windows through Desura on August 8th.

1157
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,512
[SPEAKER_01]: 2014, and then through Steam on August 18th.

1158
01:34:52,113 --> 01:34:55,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were, of course, later versions that came out.

1159
01:34:56,819 --> 01:34:59,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And it received pretty positive reviews.

1160
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:01,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It was considered frightening and distinct.

1161
01:35:01,844 --> 01:35:06,270
[SPEAKER_01]: The atmosphere, sound, gameplay, and of course lots of jump-scare

1162
01:35:07,839 --> 01:35:10,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Opportunity, at least.

1163
01:35:11,381 --> 01:35:22,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what really pushed its popularity were the let's play videos and just the big kind of cult following that it got.

1164
01:35:23,249 --> 01:35:34,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it has led to fan games and sequels and books and a movie, which I honestly, I tried to watch some of the movie and I didn't think what I watched of it sucked too badly.

1165
01:35:35,902 --> 01:35:50,808
[SPEAKER_01]: but anyway so you are the guard, Mike Schmidt and you are guarding Freddy Fazbear's Pizza you have to finish your shift and it lasts from midnight to 6am without being killed, you know, should be easy at any other job, not this one

1166
01:35:51,748 --> 01:36:19,601
[SPEAKER_01]: um so you have almost nothing in the way of defenses you have to sit in the office and you have security cameras that let you monitor the place and then you have like I guess a set battery level in doors you can open and close um and you can turn on lights here and there um and yeah like I said you've also got the steel doors to keep the the characters from opening and from coming and going um

1167
01:36:21,803 --> 01:36:49,700
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you don't prevent them from entering the office they will attack and kill you with a big jump scare and it's game over so um and it's like basically each of the levels is like one night it's about 10 minutes and then if Freddy Fazbear shows up then you hear the Toreador song you know uh anyway um for the March of the Toreadors um

1168
01:36:51,684 --> 01:36:54,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to be confused with Vampire, the Masquerade people.

1169
01:36:55,525 --> 01:36:55,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerds.

1170
01:36:56,326 --> 01:36:57,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I'm the one that came up with that.

1171
01:36:57,386 --> 01:36:57,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

1172
01:36:58,246 --> 01:37:06,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so you have a higher difficulty each night.

1173
01:37:06,549 --> 01:37:08,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have basically six levels.

1174
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the five main nights and the extra sixth night.

1175
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:13,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting to the other bit.

1176
01:37:14,071 --> 01:37:34,641
[SPEAKER_01]: so basically you listen to voicemails from his predecessor at the job that explains the story that there were the animatronics Freddy, Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy have to become mobile at night or their servo motors will lock up if they're left off too long and they said he was like

1177
01:37:35,241 --> 01:38:00,148
[SPEAKER_01]: you know make sure you keep yourself safe or you lock them up or they will mistake humans for an animatronic endoskeleton and have to put them inside a mechanical suit which of course would kill the player it talks about this thing called the bite of 87 where apparently a person lost their frontal lobe and were forced into the animatronic

1178
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:25,688
[SPEAKER_01]: um there there's all kind of other stuff you know about a murder case for five children um it's it's pretty pretty brutal um and then the fourth night there's a voicemail that implies that the previous employee was killed by an animatronic while he was recording it the fifth night has a message that's nothing but garbled sound and then you get your paycheck after the fifth and sixth night

1179
01:38:26,488 --> 01:38:33,694
[SPEAKER_01]: After the sixth night, you're given access to a seventh custom night where you can change the AI difficulty of the animatronics.

1180
01:38:34,615 --> 01:38:36,636
[SPEAKER_01]: After you finish the seventh night, you get fired.

1181
01:38:38,217 --> 01:38:38,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that great?

1182
01:38:40,219 --> 01:38:40,819
[SPEAKER_05]: What a twist.

1183
01:38:43,041 --> 01:38:43,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1184
01:38:44,442 --> 01:38:48,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So... It's foreshadowing the game industry.

1185
01:38:49,306 --> 01:38:50,887
[SPEAKER_02]: You do well, you get fired.

1186
01:38:50,927 --> 01:38:52,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway...

1187
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:11,641
[SPEAKER_01]: The point with the game is that, like, I mean, keep in mind all those other games were like Christian-oriented family whatever games, and this is a horror game that does not have set violence in it.

1188
01:39:12,381 --> 01:39:31,634
[SPEAKER_01]: no gore, no blood lots of talks about it, lots of hints to it but it uses that psychological factor to create the fear without it being graphically violent and a reviewer for Game Revolution said it was the most terrifying game he'd ever played um

1189
01:39:32,895 --> 01:39:34,916
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, of course, other versions.

1190
01:39:35,276 --> 01:39:42,221
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the Windows via Desura, there was the Steam version, and then the version for Android and iOS came out.

1191
01:39:42,801 --> 01:39:47,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Windows Phone, there's been versions for Switch, PS4, and Xbox One.

1192
01:39:47,224 --> 01:39:48,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three came out November 29th, 2019.

1193
01:39:52,288 --> 01:40:01,594
[SPEAKER_01]: The mechanics were considered well-designed, and it was like... I like the comparison of a game of red light, green light, but very lethal.

1194
01:40:02,234 --> 01:40:04,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound design was, I always thought the sound design was really good.

1195
01:40:05,855 --> 01:40:06,656
[SPEAKER_11]: How Squid Game.

1196
01:40:08,837 --> 01:40:09,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh?

1197
01:40:09,217 --> 01:40:11,057
[SPEAKER_11]: You said red light, green light, but very lethal.

1198
01:40:11,097 --> 01:40:12,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, how Squid Game.

1199
01:40:13,658 --> 01:40:14,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this predates Squid Game.

1200
01:40:14,779 --> 01:40:15,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know, but still.

1201
01:40:16,839 --> 01:40:17,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1202
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:28,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, there's a quote from Touch Arcade that said the game challenged players by forcing them to yield to their own paranoia.

1203
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:34,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is a very good way to describe it.

1204
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:42,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, instead of having...

1205
01:40:43,874 --> 01:40:47,596
[SPEAKER_01]: The jump scares, you know, just be a thing that's just there.

1206
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:51,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the possibility of one that scares you.

1207
01:40:52,759 --> 01:40:59,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think it was too reliant on the jump scares, but I kind of, it's more of the anticipation of it.

1208
01:40:59,382 --> 01:41:01,023
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's coming, right?

1209
01:41:03,318 --> 01:41:21,535
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has been just featured by some of the biggest influencers out there it was the adaptation in 2017 for the film it was the novel Five Nights at Freddy's The Silver Eyes they're just all kinds of stuff I mean they're

1210
01:41:23,271 --> 01:41:29,275
[SPEAKER_01]: There was that controversy about Cawthorn and his donations, which we won't get into.

1211
01:41:30,176 --> 01:41:35,780
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's done a statement that he intended to pass on the management of the franchise to another party.

1212
01:41:37,201 --> 01:41:41,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, this franchise has been subject to all sorts of theories.

1213
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:43,646
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of stuff.

1214
01:41:43,946 --> 01:41:50,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And, I mean, a lot of the fanbase really did get this negative reputation for being toxic.

1215
01:41:51,465 --> 01:41:54,247
[SPEAKER_01]: but still super influential.

1216
01:41:55,487 --> 01:41:57,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of fan games that were made around it.

1217
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:00,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Some published on...

1218
01:42:03,115 --> 01:42:29,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Jolt and it made them create an entire video game category dedicated to it there's just all kinds of stuff I'm not going to go into a lot of details but there was different artists doing music around the lore including the Living Tombstone and their song was featured in the closing credit sequence of the film so there you go

1219
01:42:31,525 --> 01:42:34,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to your place and watching, what was it, the sequel?

1220
01:42:34,589 --> 01:42:35,730
[SPEAKER_01]: The second one with the kid?

1221
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:38,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think this was something Shane forced me to play.

1222
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:40,795
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just not a fan of these games.

1223
01:42:40,975 --> 01:42:43,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to be very clear.

1224
01:42:44,539 --> 01:42:46,702
[SPEAKER_11]: For people that are into them, I get it.

1225
01:42:47,102 --> 01:43:10,187
[SPEAKER_11]: and like I understand why they are big games especially with younger folks because this is a horror game that's kind of safe for kids because there's not a lot of blood a lot of it is very implied sort of things you know but for me it is it's completely a game made out of jump scares which is my least favorite game in a video game that's why I don't like Mori's in Dead by Daylight you know that oh really

1226
01:43:11,573 --> 01:43:36,796
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah because they just there's just something that sets them off in my head I get the same reaction to them as I do from a jump scare for me it's not the Moris that bother me because I know they're coming for that but it's it's I cannot stand cannot stand going against Trapper and Ghostface because of the jump scares that's that's what gets me Myers for me

1227
01:43:37,941 --> 01:43:43,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Myers, I feel like the way that Myers has to play is like, I don't get jump scared as much.

1228
01:43:43,545 --> 01:43:44,785
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I get it.

1229
01:43:44,966 --> 01:43:47,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a good Myers is gonna be a jump scare.

1230
01:43:47,947 --> 01:43:48,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I get that.

1231
01:43:48,908 --> 01:43:49,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.

1232
01:43:49,448 --> 01:43:50,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you're gonna be moving.

1233
01:43:50,769 --> 01:43:52,330
[SPEAKER_11]: My MMR is not high enough for that.

1234
01:43:53,631 --> 01:43:58,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't even mind being jump scared in DBD because like, I have a scream and laugh about it.

1235
01:43:59,475 --> 01:44:05,339
[SPEAKER_01]: But not for I prefer a jump scare when I have zero anticipation of it happening.

1236
01:44:06,394 --> 01:44:19,541
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the things that I anticipate, as in what it is in Five Nights or with the Moris, that I just get this feeling of discomfort.

1237
01:44:20,101 --> 01:44:21,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they're not supposed to be happy.

1238
01:44:22,602 --> 01:44:25,244
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Shay, she loves a Mori.

1239
01:44:25,984 --> 01:44:26,905
[SPEAKER_01]: But me?

1240
01:44:29,126 --> 01:44:29,486
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1241
01:44:30,266 --> 01:44:31,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like doing them.

1242
01:44:32,455 --> 01:44:41,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that's why for so long in DBD, I stuck to playing killer because when I was in control of the jump scares, it was fine.

1243
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:43,291
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't really get jump scared as a killer.

1244
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually love playing as Ghostface.

1245
01:44:47,917 --> 01:44:49,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of ironic.

1246
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:55,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I actually like I hate that it's not as easy to photobomb a Ghostface Mori.

1247
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:03,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how Five Nights at Freddy's turned into Dead by Daylight because that's literally one of the next DLCs coming out.

1248
01:45:03,596 --> 01:45:04,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I was in that category.

1249
01:45:18,337 --> 01:45:23,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the problematic creator.

1250
01:45:24,463 --> 01:45:30,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that it sounds like some of the money is getting distanced a little bit through another agency.

1251
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:36,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, there's going to be problematic people all over the games industry.

1252
01:45:36,795 --> 01:45:40,276
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to dodge problematic people, there's a lot of games you're going to be dodging.

1253
01:45:40,416 --> 01:45:40,636
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot.

1254
01:45:40,656 --> 01:45:42,036
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to have very little left to play.

1255
01:45:43,417 --> 01:45:53,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and even, like, I think about, like, Loki plays Minecraft every single week, and we all know that the original creator of Minecraft is a gigantic douche canoe, and thankfully he has nothing to do with this.

1256
01:45:53,659 --> 01:45:58,620
[SPEAKER_11]: He has nothing to do with the series anymore, but still, you know, it just stinks.

1257
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I just imagine someone going down the river in a giant Massengill bottle.

1258
01:46:03,021 --> 01:46:03,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer's Eve.

1259
01:46:05,242 --> 01:46:29,618
[SPEAKER_01]: While singing, of course Floating down the river I'm going to take a tiny tangent here and I'll tell you why I like the word douche as an insult for guys Okay, please Because a douche is something that actively causes harm to a woman's body And I think it's highly appropriate to use that for men who cause harm to a woman's body Or anybody's body

1260
01:46:32,216 --> 01:46:32,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.

1261
01:46:32,696 --> 01:46:33,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

1262
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:34,157
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1263
01:46:34,737 --> 01:46:41,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's move on and talk about some other headlines in the gaming industry rapidly in a segment we call, appropriately, Rapid Fire News.

1264
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:42,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1265
01:46:43,779 --> 01:46:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1266
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:52,962
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know this is going to come as a big sad for you guys, but Hogwarts Legacy isn't getting its DLC it's supposed to have gotten.

1267
01:46:53,622 --> 01:46:55,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, its expansion has been canceled.

1268
01:46:56,723 --> 01:46:58,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's sad.

1269
01:46:58,203 --> 01:46:59,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, she passed away?

1270
01:46:59,604 --> 01:47:00,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, all right.

1271
01:47:01,468 --> 01:47:05,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, remember, one day we will read her obituary.

1272
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:08,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, making games on a different intellectual property.

1273
01:47:08,394 --> 01:47:08,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Great idea.

1274
01:47:08,694 --> 01:47:09,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe pick a good one.

1275
01:47:25,262 --> 01:47:30,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, I want to point out that I'm drinking this iced coffee that's Girl Scout.

1276
01:47:30,687 --> 01:47:34,610
[SPEAKER_11]: They say coconut caramel, but I prefer the other cookie factory that still calls them Samoas.

1277
01:47:36,231 --> 01:47:38,173
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm drinking this Girl Scout flavored iced coffee.

1278
01:47:38,233 --> 01:47:42,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And you think this has all the makings of like literal gay power in a can.

1279
01:47:42,977 --> 01:47:47,301
[SPEAKER_11]: It's iced coffee, cookies, but it's only okay.

1280
01:47:47,961 --> 01:47:48,702
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only okay.

1281
01:47:49,523 --> 01:47:50,503
[SPEAKER_01]: How much sugar is in it?

1282
01:47:51,204 --> 01:47:52,065
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like at 15 carbs, 13 carbs.

1283
01:47:55,353 --> 01:47:55,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant sugar.

1284
01:47:55,913 --> 01:47:56,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, actual sugars.

1285
01:47:57,035 --> 01:47:57,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Total sugars.

1286
01:47:57,876 --> 01:47:58,177
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 grams.

1287
01:47:59,619 --> 01:47:59,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not bad.

1288
01:47:59,839 --> 01:48:00,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could be worse.

1289
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,262
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still mostly coffee.

1290
01:48:02,302 --> 01:48:04,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know the coffee queen wants you to share, Rob.

1291
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:07,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Coffee.

1292
01:48:09,172 --> 01:48:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan.

1293
01:48:09,913 --> 01:48:09,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh...

1294
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:23,886
[SPEAKER_02]: We also got news that to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Undertale, they're going to be having a live orchestra performing the Undertale soundtrack in London.

1295
01:48:25,047 --> 01:48:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: The event called the Determination Symphony is going to be held June 22nd.

1296
01:48:29,589 --> 01:48:31,110
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get your tickets now.

1297
01:48:35,012 --> 01:48:37,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I should probably put Megalovania back as my ringtone.

1298
01:48:39,622 --> 01:48:52,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But mine was the Homestuck, one of the Homestuck versions Speaking of live concert symphony things I bought tickets to go see Dear Friends Is Dear Friends going to be in Sacramento?

[SPEAKER_11]: Why didn't you get me some?

[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're a grown-ass person, you get a portrait Why didn't you tell me?

1305
01:49:35,985 --> 01:49:37,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Imagine if Ben Starr went on tour with them.

1306
01:49:37,927 --> 01:49:38,307
[SPEAKER_11]: He won't.

1307
01:49:38,427 --> 01:49:38,687
[SPEAKER_11]: He won't.

1308
01:49:38,727 --> 01:49:40,428
[SPEAKER_11]: He's way too booked and blessed in other areas.

1309
01:49:40,648 --> 01:49:44,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, that Expedition 33 game, hype, hype, hype.

[SPEAKER_01]: Shay, it's the Dear Friends concert.

1314
01:49:52,617 --> 01:49:53,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Final Fantasy music.

1315
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:55,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, with an orchestra.

1316
01:49:55,539 --> 01:49:56,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's fine.

1317
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,422
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fancy night.

1318
01:49:58,482 --> 01:49:59,843
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a night at the opera.

1319
01:50:00,323 --> 01:50:01,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Except it's not opera.

1320
01:50:01,224 --> 01:50:01,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Fancy.

1321
01:50:01,985 --> 01:50:02,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Fancy.

1322
01:50:02,845 --> 01:50:03,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Fancy Feast.

1323
01:50:04,267 --> 01:50:04,527
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1324
01:50:05,407 --> 01:50:07,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, who are we on?

1325
01:50:07,569 --> 01:50:08,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we on Jamie?

1326
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:09,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're on Jamie's story.

1327
01:50:10,765 --> 01:50:10,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

1328
01:50:11,286 --> 01:50:11,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't I just?

1329
01:50:11,986 --> 01:50:12,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Rapid fire.

1330
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:13,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

1331
01:50:13,868 --> 01:50:14,969
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Tetris?

1332
01:50:16,230 --> 01:50:16,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Tetris.

1333
01:50:17,471 --> 01:50:17,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1334
01:50:17,731 --> 01:50:18,112
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you.

1335
01:50:18,232 --> 01:50:20,114
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to switch?

1336
01:50:20,154 --> 01:50:20,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1337
01:50:20,374 --> 01:50:24,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't even know why I pulled that up because shit happens, maybe?

1338
01:50:24,818 --> 01:50:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.

1339
01:50:25,238 --> 01:50:27,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because I was like, why do I have a Tetris story?

1340
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:30,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, live radio!

1341
01:50:31,804 --> 01:50:32,345
[SPEAKER_01]: SAG-AFTRA

1342
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:37,134
[SPEAKER_01]: They have made a statement.

1343
01:50:37,214 --> 01:50:46,022
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent 160,000 media professionals, including voiceover artists, and they have two new agreements.

1344
01:50:46,182 --> 01:50:50,526
[SPEAKER_01]: The Student Interactive Waiver Agreement and the Game Jam Waiver Agreement.

1345
01:50:51,567 --> 01:50:59,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Those agreements provide video game developers at every stage of their careers the opportunity to work with union performers, even as the video game strike continues.

1346
01:51:00,735 --> 01:51:05,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically so students can hire professional voice actors for their games.

1347
01:51:05,737 --> 01:51:06,197
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

1348
01:51:06,438 --> 01:51:08,899
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be a bridge that's easy.

1349
01:51:08,959 --> 01:51:15,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of one of those things you wouldn't have thought would have got left out before, but obviously SAG-AFTRA's beef is not with students and people up and coming.

1350
01:51:15,862 --> 01:51:17,062
[SPEAKER_11]: It's with large corporations.

1351
01:51:17,302 --> 01:51:18,363
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is great.

1352
01:51:18,503 --> 01:51:18,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Great news.

1353
01:51:18,783 --> 01:51:22,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works with them to help them satisfy course requirements during game developments.

1354
01:51:23,345 --> 01:51:23,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1355
01:51:24,085 --> 01:51:48,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's pretty awesome and of course like you said I don't think AI is going to enter into it they do have that the participants have to sign the project to the appropriate agreement also the big thing is that provided that the game the project does not generate revenue oh interesting okay

1356
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:58,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, does that mean if we did another game jam here at VOG Network that Bobby can make Flappy Bird with SAG-AFTRA actors?

1357
01:51:59,941 --> 01:52:01,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Flappy VOG, excuse me.

1358
01:52:01,621 --> 01:52:04,762
[SPEAKER_01]: If Bobby goes back to school for game design, then yes.

1359
01:52:05,942 --> 01:52:07,862
[SPEAKER_11]: He could take a class at a community college.

1360
01:52:11,643 --> 01:52:15,364
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, this might shock you, but I have a story about Tetris.

1361
01:52:17,855 --> 01:52:18,175
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1362
01:52:18,395 --> 01:52:22,479
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, it's that Tetris game that I know many of you are looking forward to.

1363
01:52:22,659 --> 01:52:26,383
[SPEAKER_11]: It is Tetris the Grandmaster 4, Absolute Eye.

1364
01:52:26,403 --> 01:52:30,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really surprised there's a story about Tetris.

1365
01:52:30,487 --> 01:52:31,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I know nobody would ever ruin that.

1366
01:52:32,088 --> 01:52:32,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

1367
01:52:32,869 --> 01:52:33,309
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

1368
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:35,111
[SPEAKER_11]: I just happened to find out.

1369
01:52:55,446 --> 01:52:57,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be 3,900 yen if you live over there.

1370
01:52:57,727 --> 01:52:59,748
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, this is Tetris the Grandmaster.

1371
01:53:00,248 --> 01:53:02,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It was first in arcades in August of 98.

1372
01:53:02,729 --> 01:53:07,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Then there was Grandmaster 2 in 2000, Grandmaster 3, Terror Instinct in 2005.

1373
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:11,112
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, the rights have been obtained.

1374
01:53:11,552 --> 01:53:13,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is lined up.

1375
01:53:13,272 --> 01:53:16,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we're getting a brand new Grandmaster game this week.

1376
01:53:17,274 --> 01:53:18,234
[SPEAKER_11]: What game modes?

1377
01:53:18,674 --> 01:53:19,855
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we possibly...

1378
01:53:20,635 --> 01:53:22,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Do more with Tetris, you ask?

1379
01:53:22,116 --> 01:53:23,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you have Marathon Mode.

1380
01:53:24,177 --> 01:53:25,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's not Tetris without a Marathon Mode.

1381
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:27,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You have Normal Mode.

1382
01:53:28,540 --> 01:53:30,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, you know, kind of important.

1383
01:53:30,441 --> 01:53:35,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Asuka Mode, which is for intermediate players where Tetriminos drop at top speed.

1384
01:53:35,845 --> 01:53:38,446
[SPEAKER_11]: So you better be fast, ho, to clear that.

1385
01:53:38,486 --> 01:53:39,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually in the press release.

1386
01:53:40,087 --> 01:53:42,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Asuka Mode?

1387
01:53:42,829 --> 01:53:43,249
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

1388
01:53:43,710 --> 01:53:48,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be the character they were showing in the video there, Asuka.

1389
01:53:49,153 --> 01:53:50,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1390
01:53:50,254 --> 01:53:51,935
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a backstep function.

1391
01:53:51,975 --> 01:53:55,777
[SPEAKER_11]: You can rewind if you need to replace a Tetromino.

1392
01:53:56,257 --> 01:53:56,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Master.

1393
01:53:57,598 --> 01:53:58,038
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

1394
01:53:58,098 --> 01:54:04,762
[SPEAKER_11]: You can show that you are a master baiter in Tetris where advanced players will put all Tetris skills to the test.

1395
01:54:05,482 --> 01:54:09,084
[SPEAKER_11]: You level up a bunch and Tetrominos drop at maximum speed right away.

1396
01:54:09,144 --> 01:54:11,025
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like it's similar, but there is no rewind.

1397
01:54:11,725 --> 01:54:13,126
[SPEAKER_11]: T-spins, all clears.

1398
01:54:13,306 --> 01:54:14,047
[SPEAKER_11]: You better be good.

1399
01:54:15,147 --> 01:54:16,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Kohona Mode.

1400
01:54:16,669 --> 01:54:17,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Big blocks.

1401
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:19,811
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually what's on the screen right now for our Twitch viewers.

1402
01:54:20,252 --> 01:54:21,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Big blocks.

1403
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:24,556
[SPEAKER_11]: This is bringing Duplos to a Lego match.

1404
01:54:24,796 --> 01:54:26,557
[SPEAKER_11]: It's big, big blocks.

1405
01:54:27,178 --> 01:54:33,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Every time you get an all clear, you get a bonus illustration, such as this lovely anime person playing a guitar.

1406
01:54:33,323 --> 01:54:34,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that lovely?

1407
01:54:34,945 --> 01:54:39,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Early on, you get a guide to help you, and then when you pull them off, you get visuals.

1408
01:54:39,949 --> 01:54:40,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Cute.

1409
01:54:41,490 --> 01:54:46,574
[SPEAKER_11]: and then Shiranui, I hope I'm saying this right, where you face off against CPU opponents.

1410
01:54:47,474 --> 01:54:50,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure they are going to give you hell in this game.

1411
01:54:51,257 --> 01:54:52,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So enjoy that.

1412
01:54:53,618 --> 01:54:53,819
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1413
01:54:54,999 --> 01:54:56,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, you said Shiranui?

1414
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:59,963
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a ghost story.

1415
01:55:00,803 --> 01:55:05,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, I know many of you already have this on your wish list for Steam and you're ready to go for this week.

1416
01:55:05,746 --> 01:55:06,307
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an optical illusion.

1417
01:55:07,443 --> 01:55:11,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a whore for puzzle games and I love Tetris, so I'm going to pick this up too.

1418
01:55:11,427 --> 01:55:12,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know a lot about Grandmaster.

1419
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:15,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I've just heard it is hard as hell.

1420
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:17,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

1421
01:55:17,132 --> 01:55:17,492
[SPEAKER_01]: You're correct.

1422
01:55:17,532 --> 01:55:22,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, because it's based on the Sega game that was... Not necessarily Grandmaster, maybe the Grand Bastard.

1423
01:55:25,099 --> 01:55:27,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway... And don't forget about the other mode though, Rob.

1424
01:55:28,062 --> 01:55:28,242
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1425
01:55:29,343 --> 01:55:32,085
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Master of Puppets mode where it plays nothing but Metallica.

1426
01:55:32,105 --> 01:55:32,365
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1427
01:55:32,385 --> 01:55:32,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

1428
01:55:32,806 --> 01:55:33,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

1429
01:55:33,687 --> 01:55:37,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, with it being on Steam, it's very easy to minimize the music in that game.

1430
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:41,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know how often I love to do Diablo 4 with Enya music?

1431
01:55:42,013 --> 01:55:43,154
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my favorite things.

1432
01:55:43,214 --> 01:55:44,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Slaying demons to Enya?

1433
01:55:45,016 --> 01:55:45,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Brilliance.

1434
01:55:45,917 --> 01:55:46,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I am 100% serious.

1435
01:55:46,537 --> 01:55:49,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure that that doesn't promote bowel movements?

1436
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:50,881
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1437
01:55:51,581 --> 01:55:52,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Not in this house.

1438
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:54,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

1439
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:58,103
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to travel around the world and check out some other games you can play this week.

1440
01:55:58,163 --> 01:56:01,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just Tetris the Grandmaster, but Loki, what's coming out in the US?

1441
01:56:02,367 --> 01:56:08,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much, because remember, we're past the end of the financial year now, and everybody's taking a break.

1442
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:11,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we only have four games this week.

1443
01:56:11,132 --> 01:56:12,072
[SPEAKER_02]: For some companies.

1444
01:56:12,192 --> 01:56:13,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Some companies end the financial year.

1445
01:56:13,894 --> 01:56:14,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Some end it in June.

1446
01:56:15,515 --> 01:56:17,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Most, yeah, most end it now.

1447
01:56:17,817 --> 01:56:18,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But, anyways.

1448
01:56:19,218 --> 01:56:24,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have Korya, which is coming out on PC and PlayStation 5.

1449
01:56:25,283 --> 01:56:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Croc, The Legend of Gabos on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

1450
01:56:33,869 --> 01:56:40,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, Fuel Brothers Tonosama No.

1451
01:56:41,478 --> 01:56:51,711
[SPEAKER_02]: 1 on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and finally Tetris The Grandmaster 4 Absolute Eye on PC.

1452
01:56:54,005 --> 01:56:54,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1453
01:57:20,478 --> 01:57:21,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that sounds like Shane's jam.

1454
01:57:21,799 --> 01:57:22,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if he knows about this game.

1455
01:57:23,381 --> 01:57:26,744
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, you explore and solve the hidden secrets of the hospital.

1456
01:57:26,884 --> 01:57:28,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, not a scary hospital.

1457
01:57:29,446 --> 01:57:32,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Scholar's Mate, that's coming out this week in Japan on the PlayStation 5.

1458
01:57:32,789 --> 01:57:43,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, it's empty on the Switch, which is kind of surprising, but maybe because we had that release of Saga Frontier 2 that just came out of nowhere, so maybe there's some other things there.

1459
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,901
[SPEAKER_11]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1460
01:57:47,202 --> 01:57:47,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stuff.

1461
01:57:48,463 --> 01:57:48,883
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really.

1462
01:57:49,344 --> 01:57:58,652
[SPEAKER_01]: We have on the 31st, we have Sultan's Game for PC, also Wild Keepers Rising, Post Trauma for PC, PS5, Xboxes.

1463
01:57:59,392 --> 01:58:02,054
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an undated game called Screaming in the Basement.

1464
01:58:02,134 --> 01:58:03,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to know what that is.

1465
01:58:05,641 --> 01:58:12,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on into April, on the first is Koita for PC, PS5, Niff Niff for PC and Switch.

1466
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:15,152
[SPEAKER_01]: On the second, Elroy and the Aliens for PC.

1467
01:58:15,432 --> 01:58:17,755
[SPEAKER_01]: On the third, The Last of Us Part II Remastered.

1468
01:58:18,836 --> 01:58:25,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinball FX VR for MetaQuest, Sand for PC, Echo Beach for PC, and that's it.

1469
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:31,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, now the chat is talking about my Enya Diablo thing.

1470
01:58:31,762 --> 01:58:32,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1471
01:58:32,403 --> 01:58:34,444
[SPEAKER_11]: S2100Matt just put the best idea in my head.

1472
01:58:35,145 --> 01:58:39,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiger Claw is talking about trance remixes of Enya music, which I never even knew was a thing.

1473
01:58:39,248 --> 01:58:41,329
[SPEAKER_11]: But this being the internet, of course it's a thing.

1474
01:58:42,110 --> 01:58:43,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never thought to seek that out before.

1475
01:58:44,051 --> 01:58:45,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, of course, Rule 34.

1476
01:58:45,732 --> 01:58:47,093
[SPEAKER_11]: It exists somewhere, right?

1477
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:48,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll have to seek that out.

1478
01:58:48,714 --> 01:58:49,094
[SPEAKER_11]: However...

1479
01:58:50,075 --> 01:58:53,478
[SPEAKER_11]: S200 Matt wins with this comment saying, forget the original soundtrack.

1480
01:58:53,858 --> 01:58:57,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotta call that 90s infomercial and get the Pure Moods CD.

1481
01:58:58,201 --> 01:58:58,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, perfect.

1482
01:58:58,842 --> 01:59:02,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Now look, I haven't, oh my god, I'm already hearing Enigma in my head.

1483
01:59:03,645 --> 01:59:05,466
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the return to innocence.

1484
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:07,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1485
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:36,812
[SPEAKER_11]: like every fucking I know I fucking I unironically loved Enigma in the 90s like all their original CDs are fucking great their third album was extremely underrated with Beyond the Invisible oh and the fourth oh my god their fourth album with the chick from Olive who did the vocals Gravity of Love that legit is like one of the best that song is so fucking good oh my god if you've never heard Gravity of Love by Enigma go watch the music video right now because it's so

1486
01:59:36,852 --> 01:59:44,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't done a stream in a very long time but I know my next stream because I run the audio through different channels so I can do this my next stream is going to be Diablo 4 to Pure Moods 100% we're doing it

1487
02:00:04,514 --> 02:00:07,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Rob, I was playing Palia last night.

1488
02:00:07,397 --> 02:00:07,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah?

1489
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:15,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was totally doing it to one of my old playlists, which is nothing but music from Bust a Move, Bust a Move 2.

1490
02:00:15,206 --> 02:00:15,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

1491
02:00:16,086 --> 02:00:17,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Katamari Damacy.

1492
02:00:17,128 --> 02:00:19,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say, like a DDR soundtrack?

1493
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:19,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

1494
02:00:20,671 --> 02:00:20,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

1495
02:00:20,872 --> 02:00:21,833
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't any DDR.

1496
02:00:21,853 --> 02:00:22,293
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

1497
02:00:23,434 --> 02:00:28,181
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some diverse system in there, like the diverse versus 8-bit, because I really fucking love Hinotori.

1498
02:00:30,184 --> 02:00:34,691
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was doing Polly at a Silent Hill, and that was pretty funny.

1499
02:00:35,956 --> 02:00:39,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember, do you remember, I wonder what ever happened to this guy.

1500
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:41,761
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a good friend and we just kind of drifted apart.

1501
02:00:41,781 --> 02:00:46,044
[SPEAKER_11]: But do you remember the gay guy named Garrett that used to come on the show years ago when we were at Loki's?

1502
02:00:46,364 --> 02:00:46,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember?

1503
02:00:47,905 --> 02:00:50,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember when him and I would go on long drives at night.

1504
02:00:50,547 --> 02:00:52,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing weird, just, you know, we were bored young.

1505
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:56,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would go out to the rural parts of town that were really dark.

1506
02:00:56,672 --> 02:01:00,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Like out like the Yolo Causeway rural roads out there.

1507
02:01:01,016 --> 02:01:01,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, jeez.

1508
02:01:01,656 --> 02:01:30,932
[SPEAKER_01]: and we would drive out there and blast and we would blast the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack like at max volume good times good times you just made me think of Tia Mistress Tia we would go in my Lancer driving through Citrus Heights with White Snakes Here I Go Again playing out of my cheap ass radio yeah

1509
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:33,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the days.

1510
02:01:33,231 --> 02:01:33,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1511
02:01:33,591 --> 02:01:35,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I think she unfriended me on Facebook, which is sad.

1512
02:01:35,533 --> 02:01:36,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I understand.

1513
02:01:36,353 --> 02:01:39,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't talked to her in like 10 years, so I can't be mad about it.

1514
02:01:39,176 --> 02:01:42,178
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's, you know, it's one of those like, oh, good memories.

1515
02:01:42,278 --> 02:01:46,201
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, people, the little footsteps friends leave in your heart, little things like that.

1516
02:01:46,502 --> 02:01:46,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1517
02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:47,182

1519
02:02:13,323 --> 02:02:16,585
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100 Matt says, next we will be playing games to Lilith Fair CDs.

1520
02:02:16,645 --> 02:02:18,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all know I went to the first Lilith Fair.

[SPEAKER_11]: You know that, right?

[SPEAKER_11]: I am old enough.

1524
02:02:20,948 --> 02:02:24,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to the very first Lilith Fair in Mountain View, California.

1525
02:02:25,852 --> 02:02:27,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go to the Menzies Fair?

1526
02:02:28,013 --> 02:02:29,154
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I did.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

1529

[SPEAKER_11]: That was Hedwig and the Angry Inch, right?

1530
02:02:34,237 --> 02:02:34,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Hedwig.

1531
02:02:34,737 --> 02:02:35,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was Hedwig.

[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1534
02:03:06,735 --> 02:03:09,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my name is I live on the second floor.

1535
02:03:09,497 --> 02:03:11,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sad song.

1536
02:03:11,398 --> 02:03:12,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Fiona Apple was at that date.

1537
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:14,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have remembered that.

1538
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,861
[SPEAKER_11]: It rotated from show to show.

1539
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:21,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know why I keep thinking Sheryl Crow, but I don't think it was Sheryl Crow.

1540
02:03:21,704 --> 02:03:22,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she was at one of them.

1541
02:03:23,325 --> 02:03:23,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1542
02:03:24,085 --> 02:03:29,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at the list here of who they had that toured because it wasn't all of these people one night.

1543
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I think Jewel was there.

1544
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:33,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was Jewel.

1545
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:35,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladyfingers Ladyfingers

1546
02:04:01,483 --> 02:04:04,845
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the few songs I will actually get up in karaoke sober.

1547
02:04:05,045 --> 02:04:07,366
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the other big song they had that was on MTV all the time?

1548
02:04:08,047 --> 02:04:08,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Naked Eye?

1549
02:04:08,687 --> 02:04:09,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1550
02:04:09,647 --> 02:04:15,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, Daughters of the Chaos is my other favorite by them.

1551
02:04:15,811 --> 02:04:21,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're streaming after the show tonight, and I demand 1900s music.

1552
02:04:21,894 --> 02:04:21,934
[SPEAKER_01]: 1900s?

1553
02:04:22,934 --> 02:04:24,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go get out my gramophone.

1554
02:04:24,655 --> 02:04:25,215
[SPEAKER_11]: No, 1997 is the 1900s.

1555
02:04:30,671 --> 02:04:31,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm thinking 19th century.

1556
02:04:32,112 --> 02:04:32,773
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, 1900.

1557
02:04:33,313 --> 02:04:34,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like 1900.

1558
02:04:34,875 --> 02:04:36,917
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the 1900s, 1997.

1559
02:04:37,037 --> 02:04:38,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's what the kids call it today.

1560
02:04:39,759 --> 02:04:41,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta look for my 90s playlist now.

1561
02:04:41,621 --> 02:04:42,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, awesome.

1562
02:04:42,542 --> 02:04:46,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Loki, you've got a very serious story for us to finish this up here.

1563
02:04:46,906 --> 02:04:47,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very serious.

1564
02:04:48,047 --> 02:04:49,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely dead serious.

1565
02:04:50,349 --> 02:04:53,712
[SPEAKER_02]: GOAT Direct will be taking place this year on April 1st.

1566
02:04:54,332 --> 02:04:59,597
[SPEAKER_02]: That, of course, is going to be tied in with more announcements for GOAT Simulator 3.

1567
02:05:00,317 --> 02:05:04,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And much like last year when they made announcements about the whole...

1568
02:05:05,782 --> 02:05:06,182
[SPEAKER_02]: WackyMiniGames

1569
02:05:32,503 --> 02:05:35,948
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's going to take place on Twitch, of course, on Twitch Rivals channel.

1570
02:05:36,408 --> 02:05:36,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1571
02:05:37,089 --> 02:05:37,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited.

1572
02:05:38,591 --> 02:05:44,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see what I saw the finish playing through the multiverse of nonsense.

1573
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't finish that, but I'll have to go back and do that.

1574
02:05:49,429 --> 02:05:49,769
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1575
02:05:50,110 --> 02:05:54,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with this part of the show, we'd like to welcome your comments through our listener roundtable.

1576
02:05:54,092 --> 02:06:00,016
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also always leave us messages throughout the week on our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1577
02:06:00,497 --> 02:06:01,677
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can send us emails.

1578
02:06:01,838 --> 02:06:06,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place where you can send us emails.

1579
02:06:07,361 --> 02:06:10,123
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think we had any this week, if I remember right.

1580
02:06:10,263 --> 02:06:10,423
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1581
02:06:10,784 --> 02:06:10,904
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1582
02:06:12,245 --> 02:06:12,285
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1583
02:06:12,765 --> 02:06:13,485
[SPEAKER_11]: We also...

1584
02:06:14,386 --> 02:06:15,407
[SPEAKER_11]: BlueSky, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1585
02:06:30,988 --> 02:06:35,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is living that thing we always say at the end of the episode.

1586
02:06:35,972 --> 02:06:37,513
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like, tell a friend about the show.

1587
02:06:37,573 --> 02:06:38,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Help us spread the word.

1588
02:06:38,553 --> 02:06:49,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Rite gets the Gold Star Listener of the Week award for recommending us for the starter pack because we got probably like 20 new followers on Blue Sky from it, which doesn't sound like a lot, but we value every listen.

1589
02:06:50,641 --> 02:06:53,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, put us in a starter pack of podcasts.

1590
02:06:53,843 --> 02:07:00,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I just put a post over on our own Blue Sky, which is at OrangeRite.com, the video game podcast pack.

1591
02:07:01,248 --> 02:07:02,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, thank you for that.

1592
02:07:02,989 --> 02:07:04,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And shout out to the Video Game Podcast Pack.

1593
02:07:04,710 --> 02:07:06,952
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, there is also a VOG Network Pack.

1594
02:07:07,332 --> 02:07:12,235
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are new to Blue Sky, you can also check out the VOG Network site, which is at vognetwork.com.

1595
02:07:12,815 --> 02:07:16,037
[SPEAKER_11]: And it gives you all of our personal accounts on Blue Sky.

1596
02:07:16,097 --> 02:07:27,184
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives you the show accounts and also the people that we work with here at the Voice Geeks Network, such as Bobby, Anime Jam Session, and British Invaders.

1597
02:07:27,725 --> 02:07:29,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of Anime Jam Session...

1598
02:07:29,966 --> 02:07:32,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I see that we have a call in our Discord green room.

1599
02:07:33,087 --> 02:07:34,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't we get to that call?

1600
02:07:34,668 --> 02:07:35,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do it.

1601
02:07:35,088 --> 02:07:36,089
[SPEAKER_11]: We haven't taken a call in a while.

1602
02:07:36,409 --> 02:07:37,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, you're on Orange Knowledge Radio.

1603
02:07:37,589 --> 02:07:37,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1604
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:41,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, it's the one and only Ranma.

1605
02:07:41,251 --> 02:07:43,532
[SPEAKER_07]: How is everybody doing tonight?

1606
02:07:43,572 --> 02:07:44,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic.

1607
02:07:44,413 --> 02:07:45,773
[SPEAKER_11]: It is great to hear from you, Ranma.

1608
02:07:46,213 --> 02:07:47,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me next week.

1609
02:07:49,515 --> 02:07:51,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, ask me after the reveal of the Switch 2.

1610
02:07:57,186 --> 02:08:02,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Rob, I just want you to know, I really appreciate the last 10 minutes of the show.

1611
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:04,690
[SPEAKER_11]: What, talking about the 1900s?

1612
02:08:05,891 --> 02:08:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because I just came back from 90s con about three hours ago.

1613
02:08:10,634 --> 02:08:12,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my fucking god, how was 90s con?

1614
02:08:12,816 --> 02:08:13,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know.

1615
02:08:14,176 --> 02:08:14,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

1616
02:08:14,857 --> 02:08:16,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay.

1617
02:08:17,293 --> 02:08:24,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a gift for a co-worker at work, but since you're a big fan of the show as I am, I'm going to show you what I bought him.

1618
02:08:24,415 --> 02:08:24,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do.

1619
02:08:24,935 --> 02:08:26,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

1620
02:08:27,195 --> 02:08:27,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

1621
02:08:27,776 --> 02:08:28,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice jammies, by the way.

1622
02:08:29,676 --> 02:08:31,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Squad goals, loves.

1623
02:08:31,856 --> 02:08:39,598
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's, I mean, Golden Girls is 80s, but I guess... You're right, it ran until 92.

1624
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:40,819
[SPEAKER_11]: It ran until 92.

1625
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:43,339
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to tell the Golden Gays that?

1626
02:08:43,959 --> 02:08:44,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely not.

1627
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,180
[SPEAKER_11]: The Golden Gays can do whatever they want.

1628
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:51,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I just found out they're a drag troupe out of the area and I've got to go to one of their shows.

1629
02:08:52,762 --> 02:08:54,943
[SPEAKER_11]: They used to do the drag shows here.

1630
02:08:54,983 --> 02:09:04,647
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually really sad because the big drag queen that was behind the Golden Girls staging efforts in San Francisco, Heclina, she was the drag queen that passed away unexpectedly over in Europe.

1631
02:09:05,727 --> 02:09:10,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Justice for Heclina, by the way, because the police are really dragging their feet on doing that investigation.

1632
02:09:11,269 --> 02:09:13,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I would encourage more awareness about the topic.

1633
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:19,112
[SPEAKER_11]: If you haven't heard of this, just Google Heclina and what's going on with that.

1634
02:09:19,412 --> 02:09:20,112
[SPEAKER_11]: What an inspiration.

1635
02:09:20,132 --> 02:09:21,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to be a downer, but

1636
02:09:21,553 --> 02:09:24,894
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1637
02:09:43,303 --> 02:09:47,545
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's only in, I think, Tampa Bay and Hartford, Connecticut.

1638
02:09:47,645 --> 02:09:48,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

1639
02:09:48,245 --> 02:09:48,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1640
02:09:49,085 --> 02:09:50,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1641
02:09:50,306 --> 02:09:55,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I went up there to get, you know, my bestie Mako-chan her belated birthday gift.

1642
02:09:56,508 --> 02:09:59,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Autographs by Matthew Lillard and Soleil Moonfry.

1643
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:01,190
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1644
02:10:01,210 --> 02:10:01,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck off.

1645
02:10:01,730 --> 02:10:02,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Soleil Moonfry was there?

1646
02:10:03,811 --> 02:10:04,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1647
02:10:04,631 --> 02:10:06,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1648
02:10:06,252 --> 02:10:07,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved her growing up.

1649
02:10:08,753 --> 02:10:09,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck.

1650
02:10:09,373 --> 02:10:09,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1651
02:10:10,532 --> 02:10:12,793
[SPEAKER_11]: You might be a little jealous.

1652
02:10:12,913 --> 02:10:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just laying on me.

1653
02:10:16,415 --> 02:10:21,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the line from Matthew Little is too long, so I said, screw it, I'll catch him at a Monster Mania for the autograph.

1654
02:10:22,198 --> 02:10:30,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So I get on the line, and they tell us that every hour, Soleil has to leave to get something to eat for her blood sugar, which is understandable.

1655
02:10:30,723 --> 02:10:36,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Before she left, she handed everybody a cake pop to apologize because she had to go get something to eat.

1656
02:10:36,366 --> 02:10:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute, yeah.

1657
02:10:38,107 --> 02:11:06,869
[SPEAKER_07]: and she gave everybody hugs and I told her that I am here for my bestie for a birthday gift so she autographed the first season of Punky Brewster which I have right here and I'm showing you because she doesn't watch the show so it says on here Punky Power, happy birthday with her real name on it and she's like get your phone ready so she did an impromptu happy birthday video for her

1658
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:10,962
[SPEAKER_11]: I love celebs that are so nice to their fans.

1659
02:11:10,982 --> 02:11:15,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, last week I was talking about Phyllisa Rose from Super League Camp, who's just like that, like goes the extra mile.

1660
02:11:15,984 --> 02:11:16,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Love her.

1661
02:11:16,404 --> 02:11:17,985
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's so great to hear about Suleiman Farah.

1662
02:11:18,045 --> 02:11:19,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to see her if she comes to Khan.

1663
02:11:19,606 --> 02:11:30,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say, look, Rama, as jealous as I am, a couple years ago in Reno, one of those conventions up there, like, I don't know, some comic convention was getting 90 stars.

1664
02:11:30,612 --> 02:11:34,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did get to meet and get a selfie with Jodie Sweetin from Full House.

1665
02:11:35,114 --> 02:11:43,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did... I've gotten to meet some of my, you know, 90s princesses throughout my life, so... Oh, you must have missed that post.

1666
02:11:44,842 --> 02:11:45,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, what?

1667
02:11:45,263 --> 02:11:45,943
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened now?

1668
02:11:47,265 --> 02:11:49,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I met Jodie Sweet in a 90s con last year.

1669
02:11:49,827 --> 02:11:54,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the autograph, the selfie, and we talked... I'm not jealous about that, because I've done that too.

1670
02:11:54,991 --> 02:11:55,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's great.

1671
02:11:55,892 --> 02:11:56,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.

1672
02:11:57,053 --> 02:11:57,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

1673
02:11:59,018 --> 02:12:06,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The voice of Pikachu in the Japanese version of Pokemon is also the Japanese dub voice of Stephanie Tanner on Full House and Fuller House.

1674
02:12:06,802 --> 02:12:07,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's wild.

1675
02:12:07,822 --> 02:12:08,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1676
02:12:09,723 --> 02:12:11,624
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's get to the topic you wanted to talk about tonight.

1677
02:12:11,644 --> 02:12:12,945
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, two things.

1678
02:12:13,165 --> 02:12:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: One, the whole working in the video store thing.

1679
02:12:16,606 --> 02:12:19,048
[SPEAKER_07]: At the age of 16, take these tapes.

1680
02:12:19,088 --> 02:12:19,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Where am I going?

1681
02:12:20,028 --> 02:12:21,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're going to put them in the back room.

1682
02:12:21,609 --> 02:12:22,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what's in the back room?

1683
02:12:23,130 --> 02:12:23,630
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see.

1684
02:12:23,970 --> 02:12:25,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Walks in the back room, opens the door.

1685
02:12:27,971 --> 02:12:31,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and I hear from the manager, don't stay too long back in there, back there.

1686
02:12:31,473 --> 02:12:33,015
[SPEAKER_11]: There's birds and bees in there.

1687
02:12:34,856 --> 02:12:41,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's something I don't think a lot of people know, but during the 90s of the video stores and so forth,

1688
02:12:43,397 --> 02:13:06,291
[SPEAKER_07]: movies came out a year after they hit theaters but if you went to a video store on a regular basis you were able to see those movies six months before anybody else would rental and sell through baby Loki lived that life for so long and when I lived with Loki I got the benefits of that because Loki would be like

1689
02:13:07,051 --> 02:13:08,271
[SPEAKER_11]: This movie looks gay.

1690
02:13:08,572 --> 02:13:09,272
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to look at it?

1691
02:13:09,292 --> 02:13:13,373
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, he didn't say it that way, but he knew what to look for for me, right?

1692
02:13:13,433 --> 02:13:16,654
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, oh, the Advanced Strangers with Candy DVD?

1693
02:13:17,074 --> 02:13:17,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I got you.

1694
02:13:17,674 --> 02:13:19,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to watch the movie before it's out on DVD.

1695
02:13:19,855 --> 02:13:28,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, no, Loki was a champ with that stuff years ago when we lived together in that era.

1696
02:13:28,338 --> 02:13:28,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1697
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:33,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and the whole thing about breaking street date, it is a thing.

1698
02:13:33,604 --> 02:13:39,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Because two, three blocks down from the video store I worked at was a rival video store.

1699
02:13:39,367 --> 02:13:41,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And I happened to walk in one day.

1700
02:13:41,189 --> 02:13:42,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the rival video store.

1701
02:13:43,670 --> 02:13:50,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had a list up on the wall of local video stores that were violating street date for Mortal Kombat 1.

1702
02:13:50,375 --> 02:13:52,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And our video store was listed there.

1703
02:13:52,896 --> 02:13:53,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, oh.

1704
02:13:54,958 --> 02:13:55,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

1705
02:13:55,398 --> 02:13:55,738
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

1706
02:13:57,019 --> 02:13:57,860
[SPEAKER_11]: That's so funny.

1707
02:14:00,177 --> 02:14:02,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids today will never know the joys of working in a video store.

1708
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, not for nothing.

1709
02:14:05,381 --> 02:14:07,142
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I used to get my anime dirt cheap.

1710
02:14:08,963 --> 02:14:09,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.

1711
02:14:10,904 --> 02:14:12,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else on your mind to share with us tonight, Ranma?

1712
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:19,049
[SPEAKER_07]: A few weeks ago, you talked about the PlayStation FPGA emulator.

1713
02:14:19,069 --> 02:14:20,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's called the Super Station.

1714
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:23,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw it and I actually thought about it.

1715
02:14:24,451 --> 02:14:35,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Picking that up and then because there are emulated games that I have never gotten a chance to play because either I couldn't rent it or I couldn't afford it or something like that.

1716
02:14:36,195 --> 02:14:46,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I started looking at my current game collection and all these remasters coming out and I'm just like, oh, Grandia, let me get that.

1717
02:14:46,338 --> 02:14:47,138
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't get a chance to play that.

1718
02:14:47,158 --> 02:14:48,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me add that to my collection.

1719
02:14:49,019 --> 02:14:51,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Sukiyota, I only was able to play two hours of that.

1720
02:14:51,899 --> 02:14:52,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get that.

1721
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:53,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And I realized...

1722
02:14:54,417 --> 02:14:55,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, that's so funny.

1723
02:15:23,396 --> 02:15:23,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1724
02:15:24,418 --> 02:15:24,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1725
02:15:24,899 --> 02:15:32,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they did that whole pixel remaster, which I'm going to go into, and I know you're probably mentally laughing about that because you probably called that.

1726
02:15:33,444 --> 02:15:36,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, when they announced that Pixel Remaster, I remembered that.

1727
02:15:36,786 --> 02:15:37,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you know what?

1728
02:15:37,607 --> 02:15:39,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta get my hands on it.

1729
02:15:39,348 --> 02:15:41,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Square Enix, get an available physical copy, $74.99.

1730
02:15:41,589 --> 02:15:44,952
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my black ass, Square Enix.

1731
02:15:45,312 --> 02:15:45,632
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1732
02:15:46,493 --> 02:15:47,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Holidays come around.

1733
02:15:47,793 --> 02:15:49,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy two, get one free.

1734
02:15:49,234 --> 02:15:52,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if I get this game, I get this game, the game comes out to $30.

1735
02:15:53,297 --> 02:15:54,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll buy it then.

1736
02:15:54,418 --> 02:15:54,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

1737
02:15:55,358 --> 02:15:58,300
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just found out that my sister has a Switch.

1738
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:58,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, you know what?

1739
02:15:59,801 --> 02:16:02,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just get her a copy of Pixel Remaster.

1740
02:16:02,563 --> 02:16:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: That game's expensive.

1741
02:16:04,124 --> 02:16:04,584
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1742
02:16:04,604 --> 02:16:08,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Your sister could save over your save file so it could feel just like old times.

1743
02:16:10,166 --> 02:16:12,507
[SPEAKER_08]: We had our own Nintendo.

1744
02:16:13,848 --> 02:16:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm like, okay, I will get her this game.

1745
02:16:17,625 --> 02:16:18,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Game's expensive.

1746
02:16:18,705 --> 02:16:21,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just keep an eye out on who has it.

1747
02:16:21,786 --> 02:16:28,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I end up importing the game from Canada because it was on sale for $45.99 US.

1748
02:16:28,828 --> 02:16:30,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1749
02:16:30,308 --> 02:16:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: But shipping, $50 done.

1750
02:16:32,229 --> 02:16:35,330
[SPEAKER_07]: The following week, price cut.

1751
02:16:35,630 --> 02:16:37,910
[SPEAKER_07]: The Pixel Remastered game for Switch and PS4 is $49.99.

1752
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:38,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just like...

1753
02:16:41,051 --> 02:16:44,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, Rob Harris, ain't that a bitch?

1754
02:16:44,793 --> 02:16:46,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, at least you didn't pay.

1755
02:16:46,713 --> 02:16:49,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of those FFS moments for a fuck's sake.

1756
02:16:49,675 --> 02:16:49,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1757
02:16:51,615 --> 02:17:04,421
[SPEAKER_07]: But in a way, I'm not too salty because I picked up mine in a two-for-one special, so when it comes down to it, I pay maybe like $30 to $35 per game, so it's not so bad, so...

1758
02:17:05,734 --> 02:17:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me flip this over to y'all.

1759
02:17:08,475 --> 02:17:20,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any games that you recently bought just because either you didn't have the ability to play it previously or you're only able to play it for a few hours for XYZ reasons?

1760
02:17:21,491 --> 02:17:25,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Similar to you, but different, the Suikoden 1 and 2 HD remaster.

1761
02:17:25,294 --> 02:17:28,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the reason that pushed me to that is that I've actually not really played Suikoden 2.

1762
02:17:29,538 --> 02:17:32,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I played the first one, but never really the second one.

1763
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:36,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, I haven't put any time into it, and I need to, but such is life sometimes.

1764
02:17:36,323 --> 02:17:37,204
[SPEAKER_11]: But that would be my answer.

1765
02:17:37,624 --> 02:17:40,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't bought an actual classic game in a hot minute.

1766
02:17:40,867 --> 02:17:43,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to these game shops that Loki's going to.

1767
02:17:43,789 --> 02:17:48,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, I'm going to throw it over to you next, because you were talking about, did you buy anything at that Fire and Ice shop?

1768
02:17:49,011 --> 02:17:50,192
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did not.

1769
02:17:50,232 --> 02:17:52,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know I wouldn't play it.

1770
02:17:54,094 --> 02:17:55,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then DarkSakura.

1771
02:17:55,915 --> 02:17:56,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at Zelda, though.

1772
02:17:57,155 --> 02:17:59,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted a copy of Zelda.

1773
02:17:59,716 --> 02:18:00,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been there yet.

1774
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:06,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I want to go by, look for games that quite likely I already own?

1775
02:18:07,318 --> 02:18:15,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, like, but to Ranma's question, have you bought something recently that you haven't had a chance to, like, that you bought it because you hadn't had a chance to play it yet or whatever?

1776
02:18:16,684 --> 02:18:19,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought games so I could legally emulate them.

1777
02:18:21,768 --> 02:18:26,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought Wonder Project J, and I need to pick up Marvelous.

1778
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:30,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not found an affordable Rudra no Hiho yet.

1779
02:18:31,335 --> 02:18:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, yeah.

1780
02:18:34,337 --> 02:18:34,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1781
02:18:35,782 --> 02:18:39,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in that case, you might want to remind me about that game in about six weeks.

1782
02:18:43,107 --> 02:18:43,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1783
02:18:44,228 --> 02:18:46,790
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm going back to Japan for my birthday.

1784
02:18:47,971 --> 02:18:51,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's something I'm looking for for Dan over there.

1785
02:18:52,815 --> 02:18:57,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that huge-ass, thousand-pound Genesis controller.

1786
02:18:58,979 --> 02:19:04,143
[SPEAKER_07]: There is another Super Potato where I will be staying at, so I will be checking there for it.

1787
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:06,860
[SPEAKER_07]: and they have, I will let you know.

1788
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:08,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Take me with you.

1789
02:19:08,421 --> 02:19:09,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy you get to go back to Japan.

1790
02:19:09,881 --> 02:19:10,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

1791
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:13,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hatefully jealous, but I am happy for you.

1792
02:19:13,502 --> 02:19:13,962
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

1793
02:19:14,342 --> 02:19:14,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait.

1794
02:19:14,942 --> 02:19:15,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, okay.

1795
02:19:15,922 --> 02:19:16,482
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, okay.

1796
02:19:16,662 --> 02:19:18,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured this was going to come up.

1797
02:19:18,503 --> 02:19:21,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we fucking go.

1798
02:19:21,343 --> 02:19:26,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Last weekend, I saw something for you and Alan that I bought that I'm going to put in the box and ship to you.

1799
02:19:26,904 --> 02:19:28,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show it to you right now.

1800
02:19:28,525 --> 02:19:29,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Ship it from Japan.

1801
02:19:29,405 --> 02:19:30,325
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll get here faster.

1802
02:19:36,179 --> 02:19:36,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish.

1803
02:19:37,220 --> 02:19:43,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had a friend of mine ship me a couple of Ranma 1.5 magazines because I didn't think I'd get them at Kinokuniya.

1804
02:19:43,366 --> 02:19:46,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a friend now looking for Ranma's outfit.

1805
02:19:46,990 --> 02:19:52,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just like, if you see it, get the largest size you can and hold onto it till you come back.

1806
02:19:52,496 --> 02:19:52,897
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um...

1807
02:19:54,232 --> 02:20:02,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I know y'all went on the Trek cruise and I'm going through Artist Alley and I saw these amazing fried Trek pins.

1808
02:20:02,336 --> 02:20:02,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1809
02:20:02,937 --> 02:20:03,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

1810
02:20:03,717 --> 02:20:03,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1811
02:20:04,257 --> 02:20:05,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, those are cool too.

1812
02:20:06,158 --> 02:20:08,340
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a guy that like 3D prints them on the cruise.

1813
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:09,220
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a different design.

1814
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,461
[SPEAKER_11]: So somebody else is doing that.

1815
02:20:10,621 --> 02:20:15,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I love that there's the trans next to the OG, but they don't, they don't have the black and brown, do they?

1816
02:20:16,724 --> 02:20:17,184
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a bummer.

1817
02:20:17,384 --> 02:20:19,186
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they didn't have that.

1818
02:20:19,566 --> 02:20:21,647
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not okay, but I'll take it.

1819
02:20:21,988 --> 02:20:22,668
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a nice design.

1820
02:20:24,149 --> 02:20:24,589
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a start.

1821
02:20:25,050 --> 02:20:26,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a start.

1822
02:20:26,591 --> 02:20:30,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pointing like, oh, it's on my shirt right now and I haven't been on the cruise in a month.

1823
02:20:31,314 --> 02:20:37,178
[SPEAKER_11]: He did a rainbow pattern last year and this year he did the progressive flag with the trans and the black brown in it.

1824
02:20:38,679 --> 02:20:39,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool.

1825
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:41,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that stuff.

1826
02:20:41,761 --> 02:20:43,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't just wear them.

1827
02:20:43,222 --> 02:20:45,063
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a bag that we put pins on.

1828
02:20:45,083 --> 02:20:46,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Alan and I love pins.

1829
02:20:46,864 --> 02:20:47,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm so happy.

1830
02:20:47,705 --> 02:20:49,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an Ita bag with all your pins on them?

1831
02:20:50,328 --> 02:20:51,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I think my bag's in this room.

1832
02:20:51,749 --> 02:20:52,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1833
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:52,950
[SPEAKER_11]: My bag.

1834
02:20:52,970 --> 02:20:54,532
[SPEAKER_11]: My poor Ita bag finally died.

1835
02:20:54,952 --> 02:20:57,014
[SPEAKER_11]: My bag happens to be in this room.

1836
02:20:57,074 --> 02:20:59,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I say it's my bag, but it's actually Alan's bag.

1837
02:20:59,857 --> 02:21:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

1838
02:21:00,818 --> 02:21:02,720
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's... Oh, shit, I'm knocking things over.

1839
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:06,423
[SPEAKER_11]: That's our little Alola duck trio.

1840
02:21:06,483 --> 02:21:07,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that was...

1841
02:21:07,344 --> 02:21:21,600
[SPEAKER_11]: that is precious let's see Stressy, Depressy, Lemon Zesty you know, just a variety of weird shit that I come across so that's where that Star Trek pin's going awesome

1842
02:21:23,083 --> 02:21:23,323
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1843
02:21:23,563 --> 02:21:25,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Ranma, it's a pleasure as always to have you on the show.

1844
02:21:25,605 --> 02:21:26,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate you.

1845
02:21:26,926 --> 02:21:27,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime.

1846
02:21:27,786 --> 02:21:30,368
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we going to hear 90s Con on Anime Jam Session this Tuesday?

1847
02:21:30,888 --> 02:21:34,370
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear a little bit of it, and we'll be talking about other things as well.

1848
02:21:34,731 --> 02:21:36,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and one more thing I forgot to mention.

1849
02:21:36,292 --> 02:21:44,277
[SPEAKER_07]: When I bought this Squad Goals mug, the guy put two pieces of Grandma's candy in there for me.

1850
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:50,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, I don't know where they come from but they're absolutely delicious and I love it.

1851
02:21:50,732 --> 02:21:52,253
[SPEAKER_11]: No, those strawberry things are bomb.

1852
02:21:52,313 --> 02:21:53,473
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find them.

1853
02:21:53,693 --> 02:21:56,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, do they have Winco out there?

1854
02:21:57,175 --> 02:21:57,355
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1855
02:21:57,535 --> 02:22:04,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Look for a place that sells food by bulk like Winco does because the strawberry shit is in bulk candy sections.

1856
02:22:04,557 --> 02:22:05,037
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find them.

1857
02:22:05,798 --> 02:22:05,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1858
02:22:07,238 --> 02:22:09,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck and or I'm sorry.

1859
02:22:09,399 --> 02:22:09,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Take your choice.

1860
02:22:12,048 --> 02:22:13,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Ramma, you take care of yourself, my friend.

1861
02:22:14,170 --> 02:22:14,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Easy.

1862
02:22:14,650 --> 02:22:16,271
[SPEAKER_07]: All of y'all take care of yourselves.

1863
02:22:16,631 --> 02:22:22,055
[SPEAKER_07]: As I say on my show, and the late, great Jerry Springer says, take care of yourselves and each other.

1864
02:22:22,375 --> 02:22:23,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Rest in peace, Jerry Springer.

1865
02:22:23,436 --> 02:22:24,177
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, take care, Ramma.

1866
02:22:25,337 --> 02:22:25,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, Ramma.

1867
02:22:26,058 --> 02:22:29,981
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, always a pleasure to hear from the one and only Ramma here on the show.

1868
02:22:30,841 --> 02:22:38,747
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, the controller, before I forget, is the XE-1AP, and it weighs like a bag of bricks.

1869
02:22:40,056 --> 02:22:44,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat spotted the Duck Dodgers pin on my bag.

1870
02:22:44,259 --> 02:22:46,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, that is 100% because of Dragon Con reference.

1871
02:22:47,381 --> 02:22:48,562
[SPEAKER_11]: There's this cute little store.

1872
02:22:48,602 --> 02:22:51,624
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I host these live horror shows and all this stuff, right?

1873
02:22:52,005 --> 02:22:57,589
[SPEAKER_11]: This cute little store that sells all this goth shit opened up right next and she's...

1874
02:22:58,229 --> 02:22:58,730
[SPEAKER_11]: She's so smart.

1875
02:22:58,790 --> 02:23:04,534
[SPEAKER_11]: She opens up that store on nights that the Love Horror Events is doing a production at the Colonial.

1876
02:23:04,835 --> 02:23:09,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think she runs an online shop to keep her sales going through the rest of the year.

1877
02:23:09,578 --> 02:23:12,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And she has pins, pins, pins.

1878
02:23:12,781 --> 02:23:13,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I was browsing.

1879
02:23:13,602 --> 02:23:15,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that three for $25.

1880
02:23:15,303 --> 02:23:18,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was browsing the pins one night, and I saw the Duck Dodgers.

1881
02:23:18,105 --> 02:23:20,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was like, oh, that's Dragon Con.

1882
02:23:20,087 --> 02:23:20,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a Duck Dodgers pin.

1883
02:23:21,428 --> 02:23:24,529
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, what else came from that night?

1884
02:23:24,589 --> 02:23:29,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the one that says, oh, the Marvin the Martian is from Duck Dodgers.

1885
02:23:30,251 --> 02:23:32,331
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I had an actual Duck Dodgers pin, too.

1886
02:23:32,791 --> 02:23:35,472
[SPEAKER_01]: FYI, it's just Marvin Martian.

1887
02:23:38,013 --> 02:23:38,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1888
02:23:39,213 --> 02:23:41,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Mr. Rogers one came from that, too.

1889
02:23:41,434 --> 02:23:42,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, Rob.

1890
02:23:43,694 --> 02:23:44,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually.

1891
02:23:44,435 --> 02:23:44,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually.

1892
02:23:45,655 --> 02:23:45,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

1893
02:23:47,478 --> 02:23:48,779
[SPEAKER_11]: A Sailor Venus pin.

1894
02:23:48,839 --> 02:23:49,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you did.

1895
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:51,701
[SPEAKER_11]: You did spot a Sailor Venus pin in the corner.

1896
02:23:51,821 --> 02:23:52,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You sure did.

1897
02:23:53,142 --> 02:23:53,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So, all right.

1898
02:23:54,543 --> 02:23:58,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to tell you about the pins I just picked up, by the way, because you'll enjoy this.

1899
02:23:59,946 --> 02:24:01,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I now have a Dracula and an Alucard.

1900
02:24:02,888 --> 02:24:03,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I love it.

1901
02:24:04,189 --> 02:24:04,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're big.

1902
02:24:05,750 --> 02:24:08,031
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Sailor Venus pin on there because it's Alan's bag.

1903
02:24:08,131 --> 02:24:10,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I just stole it because that's what happens when you're married.

1904
02:24:10,293 --> 02:24:11,453
[SPEAKER_11]: You steal each other's things.

1905
02:24:12,874 --> 02:24:13,134
[SPEAKER_11]: True. 100%.

1906
02:24:15,037 --> 02:24:19,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, on that note, Loki, any last-minute stories before we wrap it up tonight?

1907
02:24:19,599 --> 02:24:20,440
[SPEAKER_02]: There is nothing.

1908
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:21,100
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1909
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's waiting until, you know, Switch 2 announcements.

1910
02:24:25,626 --> 02:24:26,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Clenched with Baited Breath.

1911
02:24:26,906 --> 02:24:27,146
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1912
02:24:27,186 --> 02:24:31,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then I will say thank you as always for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting our show.

1913
02:24:31,287 --> 02:24:34,428
[SPEAKER_11]: If you enjoyed what you heard here, help us spread the word and leave a review.

1914
02:24:34,488 --> 02:24:40,369
[SPEAKER_11]: A nice five-star review on a space like Apple Podcasting, Spotify, or YouTube goes an awful long way.

1915
02:24:40,709 --> 02:24:41,449
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate all that.

1916
02:24:41,509 --> 02:24:42,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell a friend.

1917
02:24:42,790 --> 02:24:43,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Help us spread the word.

1918
02:24:43,430 --> 02:24:45,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

1919
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:46,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Final thoughts.

1920
02:24:46,350 --> 02:24:49,111
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to start with DarkSakura because I believe you are streaming tonight.

1921
02:24:50,436 --> 02:24:50,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

1922
02:24:50,936 --> 02:24:59,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, I thought that my schedule was going to an hour earlier, which would have deeply infringed upon any time so that I could have, you know, after stream time.

1923
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:04,002
[SPEAKER_01]: My schedule stayed the same, and I'm still working from home on Monday, so hell yeah.

1924
02:25:05,882 --> 02:25:09,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well we will see you in the Debbies, and I will have a Shay with me.

1925
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:10,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds great.

1926
02:25:10,841 --> 02:25:11,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good time.

1927
02:25:11,742 --> 02:25:13,563
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you in a little bit.

1928
02:25:36,764 --> 02:25:41,646
[SPEAKER_11]: How the fuck did Rob plant 28,000 flowers in the Pikmin Challenge this week?

1929
02:25:42,247 --> 02:25:47,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this friend and I are encouraging each other to walk five miles every time we do it.

1930
02:25:48,190 --> 02:25:55,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have this giant loop that we go drive and walk a big five miles now that it's late enough at night that we've been doing.

1931
02:25:56,073 --> 02:25:57,354
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do that at least twice.

1932
02:25:57,374 --> 02:25:59,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to get in a third one.

1933
02:26:00,115 --> 02:26:01,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Bobby says, I felt bad that I had Big Fat Zero.

1934
02:26:01,976 --> 02:26:02,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't feel bad.

1935
02:26:02,577 --> 02:26:05,278
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's other parts of the country have inclement weather.

1936
02:26:05,678 --> 02:26:07,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I had COVID a few weeks ago and didn't walk at all.

1937
02:26:08,019 --> 02:26:14,923
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm happy to carry the group because it actually gives me more motivation to walk the 10,000 steps and five miles.

1938
02:26:15,363 --> 02:26:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: So it works for me.

1939
02:26:17,124 --> 02:26:18,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1940
02:26:18,605 --> 02:26:24,188
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, Wednesday night, nerding out over the Switch 2 announcements, probably going to happen.

1941
02:26:24,228 --> 02:26:25,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Loki will be here too.

1942
02:26:25,348 --> 02:26:25,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1943
02:26:26,249 --> 02:26:27,509
[SPEAKER_11]: You and Jamie have an invited horse.

1944
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:30,371
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Loki, your final thoughts for tonight.

1945
02:26:31,597 --> 02:26:36,243
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is just I should be doing some streaming later this month.

1946
02:26:36,604 --> 02:26:36,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1947
02:26:37,465 --> 02:26:40,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and then on the flip side, I get Jury Duty at the end of the month.

1948
02:26:40,349 --> 02:26:41,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Jury Duty?

1949
02:26:42,191 --> 02:26:43,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Who did you piss off?

1950
02:26:45,282 --> 02:26:45,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.

1951
02:26:45,842 --> 02:26:46,383
[SPEAKER_11]: That's no fun.

1952
02:26:46,543 --> 02:26:46,803
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1953
02:26:46,843 --> 02:26:47,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good luck with all that.

1954
02:26:48,364 --> 02:26:48,664
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1955
02:26:48,744 --> 02:26:54,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with that, we are going to wrap it up here at the Voice Geeks Network for the day and for our show.

1956
02:26:54,228 --> 02:26:55,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1957
02:26:56,389 --> 02:26:57,690
[SPEAKER_11]: We will see you in seven days.

1958
02:26:57,790 --> 02:27:01,932
[SPEAKER_11]: And finally, finally, no more switch to rumors for now.

1959
02:27:02,653 --> 02:27:04,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Switch to facts.

1960
02:27:04,454 --> 02:27:06,175
[SPEAKER_11]: We get to decompress them all next week.

1961
02:27:06,315 --> 02:27:07,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you will be here with us.

1962
02:27:07,936 --> 02:27:09,017
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be an exciting week.

1963
02:27:09,057 --> 02:27:09,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Until next time.

1964
02:27:09,757 --> 02:27:09,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1965
02:27:12,059 --> 02:27:14,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1966
02:27:16,782 --> 02:27:17,283
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week.
