9955	18569	and Gadget reported on Microsoft's Copilot for Gaming preview referring to its ability to help folks download and launch games as Copilot solves the eternal problem of pressing a button.
18917	20598	Not everything is distributed through a launcher.
20839	24962	Notably, downloading content via HIO requires one to be reasonably adept with using a computer.
25222	31147	Sure, we've been doing this since the 90s, but there's a reason why technology and gaming continues to proliferate the way it does these days.
31607	33208	Because someone made it easier.
33609	34549	Everyone is a beginner once.
34890	40074	Now it's time for your hosts, Straw Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about Copilot for Gaming and the rest of the week's gaming news.
40354	42416	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
45034	47435	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
47455	52338	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
52478	54559	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
54879	59761	We're live with you once again tonight, March the 16th of 2025.
60222	61162	Happy pre-St.
61202	62563	Patrick's Day, as the case may be.
62943	64944	It is episode number 1038 of our show.
67285	76589	We are here every week at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, Sunday nights, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, except not tonight.
77009	83912	Bobby Blackwolf is out watching sports ball that he has season tickets for, so he is out watching the sports ball.
84252	94036	But we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gaming lifestyle, and gaming bullshit a lot with me, Rob Roberts, and the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
95056	95276	Hi.
95496	96557	Hi, how are you, Jamie Summers?
98281	105704	I'm getting over a cold and I have been completely obsessed with watching Chinese period dramas.
106864	107364	Oh, fun.
107525	108665	About harem life.
109345	109925	Oh my gosh.
109945	113807	Are they current or are they like made in the 80s or things like that?
115104	117705	Well, what do you mean, made in the 80s?
117745	119546	The show is a fairly recent one.
119566	120347	Okay, that's what I mean.
120827	121767	Ancient story.
122047	125509	Because, like, you know, you could get into something like, oh, God, what's that show?
125569	126269	Downton Abbey.
126350	128050	But that's like a 20-year-old show at this point.
128090	132172	You know, like that, you know, I'm just kind of, like, if it's a modern show or if it's a classic show.
132192	134373	I'll have to see when it came out.
134453	139536	But, I mean, it had really high production value and looks really nice.
139636	139996	I mean.
140276	140576	Okay.
141337	142977	It's called Empresses in the Palace.
143478	143718	Fun.
145455	147316	If it's in HD, you know it's like at least 2010.
147576	149057	The melodrama is real.
149938	151459	It's not a drama, it's a melodrama.
152259	153480	Oh, good.
153980	155101	Which one's more dramatic?
155161	156982	What you're watching or a telenovela?
157502	158983	Because I love me a telenovela.
159583	160944	Even though I don't understand.
160984	163025	I have to watch the subtitles, but they're so good.
163825	165506	It's kind of a different kind of drama.
165526	166167	Mm-hmm.
166789	168290	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
194289	218907	I am at the revenge part 76 episodes and I'm on 56 since this is a video gaming podcast I'm trying to think is there a game that has that high level of drama and I'm like I don't know why but the first game that came to mind was Metal Gear with that type of it's not dramatic enough they do reference the time of the three kingdoms okay
220202	223063	Like those, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and all those games?
223283	223503	Yeah.
223623	227344	Yeah, which was a real, you know, period of history.
227364	234065	So they talk about some of the, like, different texts that have influenced some games and stuff.
234165	246888	So, I mean, it kinda goes, but it's a... I'm stupidly into it, and I just looked at it because I was mildly curious, and I can't stop.
247665	251390	I need to see where this train wreck goes I don't know
266790	268372	Nothing.
269473	270013	We have learned nothing.
270053	272796	I would say I've learned prime numbers thanks to number munchers.
272896	274137	That's what I learned from video games.
274197	275838	Either way, this show came out in 2011.
276939	277620	Okay, okay.
278521	278761	Nice.
280142	280483	All right.
280503	281223	Before times.
281463	282024	Before times.
282064	282865	How are you doing, Loki?
283065	283685	How's your week been?
285241	286743	It was good up until today.
287523	288064	I'm sorry.
288164	289185	I hope everything's going okay.
290086	290867	It's fine.
290967	292329	It's just disappointing.
293490	297675	So it's the Stray Cat drama stuff.
297995	303562	So Stray Cat is... I haven't heard the latest on this in a while.
304420	305101	Oh, no, no, no.
305141	309085	Yeah, so we've been acclimating the cat more and more to the house.
310446	314290	She just comes in like a few times a day usually and eats and stuff.
314310	319576	She has a bed and doesn't really use it because, you know, cats never use the things that you purchase for them.
319636	320156	No, they don't.
320957	321938	So we just installed a...
324212	328354	Like a cat door for the inside-outside, and she's been going into the garage.
328394	330736	I started letting her go into the garage.
331456	336299	And she takes naps in, like, a dirty... My old office chair that's, like, super dusty out there.
337159	338000	For whatever reason.
338120	339600	I think it's because it's quiet.
340621	341962	And she'll come in for pets and stuff like that.
342122	344823	Well, anyways, so I got knocked on the door today.
344843	345764	Uh...
347208	370125	there's like a woman standing outside she's like you know about this cat i'm like yeah it's a stray cat that i've been taking care of you know she's like oh she's like i've been taking care of that cat for seven and a half years um and she lives across the street i guess but apparently she got another cat or something like that or there was another cat that she's taking care of that's scaring the other cat away and so she's been missing for a while um
370936	395135	and so she's been coming over here to stay but apparently she goes over there and also like sleeps in their bed and stuff and all that stuff so it's just this point because like I don't like I was trying to work towards adopting the cat and now I can't do that so it's like it's just I don't know it's annoying all right is the neighbor at least still let the cat wander into your dirty office chair
396010	397752	I mean, yeah, yeah, she's fine.
397772	400515	She's relieved that the cat's not, like, living on the street.
400655	410645	That she's, you know, and I think she's living somewhere else, too, because she always goes, like, the neighbor is in one direction, but the cat always goes in the opposite direction.
410705	414529	So I'm like, she's, like, sleeping over somewhere over there.
414649	415550	I don't really know.
416410	418573	I'm with FifthDream in chat.
418653	419654	A little two-timing kitty.
420851	421732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
443376	464542	yeah and left back into the park and she wandered over here and then the woman took care of her for a while um I don't know like whatever it's just it's annoying because like we've been investing all this time and stuff we're like oh yeah we need to get the pet doors so when we go on vacation in a few months you know that she can get out on her own and like
465758	476012	um and it's like oh yeah hey cool well I'm just gonna be like you know owning the cat now and she'll come over here occasionally you know here here's some of her food and her toy it's like but I'm
476482	477742	Am I taking care of this cat now?
477862	479743	Like, are you taking care of this cat?
479763	481023	Whose fucking cat is this?
481243	481563	Yeah.
481623	482023	Exactly.
482083	485884	It's like, I'm like, is this... Are you saying I can take this cat?
485984	491705	Or are you saying that, like, you're keeping the cat, but it sounds like you're keeping the cat still, but I'm taking care of the cat.
491765	492906	Like, I don't understand what's going on.
492926	495546	It's my cat, but you're going to take care of it and pay.
495766	496986	It's not whose cat it is.
497327	498687	It's who belongs to the cat.
499407	499827	I guess.
499907	500587	It's true, too.
500627	501527	It's confusing.
501828	503188	It's just, it's very confusing.
503208	503248	So...
505223	505723	I don't know.
506084	507324	No, I mean, that was fun.
507525	508865	I totally get your frustrations, Loki.
508905	513308	Like it was always the worst fear in the back of my mind when Mr. Smush was around.
513368	514389	Obviously, he's no longer with us.
514429	523434	But when he was around, like I was always like, oh, the owners are going to answer the phone someday or the, you know, suddenly show up, you know, out of nowhere and be like, oh, we've been missing our cat for six years.
524075	525435	And that was like always my worst fear.
526076	526856	So I get it.
526956	529198	Like you invest all that time and energy into a cat.
529398	529558	So.
529918	531560	I mean, she's still hanging.
531600	532921	I mean, she's in the garage right now.
533041	534963	Like, so she still hangs out over here.
535123	536904	It seems like a lot more than the other house.
537104	539506	But I think it's because she's been gone for a while.
539587	542129	I think she hasn't been over there very often.
542169	547694	And when she is going over there, she's not as like super hungry as she normally is because she's eating here.
548895	550957	So the woman is confused as to what's going on.
550977	552478	But I think she's relieved in that sense.
552538	553319	But like, I don't know.
553359	556742	You just need to look her dead in the eye and be like, ma'am, your cat is a whore.
558171	569294	Well, it's not bad, it's like, it's like, because, like, I feel bad, like, if I, okay, so say this is the other woman's cat, like, and now I decide, okay, I want to get a permanent cat for the house.
569794	577076	Like, I would feel bad if this cat, like, all of a sudden is like, oh, I'm scared to go into this house now, and I'm going to go hide.
577176	582917	It's like, I don't know, it feels, like, bad to do that to, like, an animal or something, but, you know.
583399	590542	But it also sounds like the cat's kind of established itself in your garage, which I'm not sure a lot of cats would otherwise go into.
590562	596604	I mean, I guess I don't know the traffic of your house, but maybe... Like, I would think if that situation were to happen, the cats would probably have their different areas.
596984	598645	Like, your new cat just wouldn't go to the garage.
598665	603507	She's very skittish in the sense that, like, she doesn't like when people are... Well, like, she's fine with...
605167	607008	Me and my wife hanging out and stuff.
607048	611851	It's like the kids running around or shouting or doing whatever they're doing.
612191	613491	She's uncomfortable.
613712	615813	The sound of the heater coming on and stuff like that.
615833	617934	She doesn't understand what the house sounds are.
620015	623877	I think the garage is just quiet and she's used to sleeping outside.
624177	625097	I don't know.
626078	628819	She's usually around a lot more once it's raining out.
629159	630560	But now she has a way in and out.
631340	634242	It's just weird because I thought we were working towards a point and it's like
635708	638649	I guess that's not going to happen, so whatever.
638889	639889	Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
640269	642130	It's a complicated sort of situation.
642390	648492	Keep us updated on who the cat chooses, because it sounds like the cat might be choosing you most of the time.
648552	654354	But that cat is a little two-timer, so look out for empty promises and so forth in that cat.
655074	659156	Alright, well anyway, we do talk about video games once in a while here on this show.
659396	661157	There's been a little bit going on this week, actually.
661177	663258	I feel like we've had some somewhat slower news weeks.
663658	665179	I feel like this week's really been picking up.
666079	670261	We have a pretty damn big headline to start us off, especially in the world of mobile games.
670341	675384	Loki, I'm going to turn it over to you, but when y'all hear what this is about, you know I'm going to have opinions.
675584	677985	I have a lot of opinions on this, but I'm going to let Loki start off.
678840	686923	Yeah, so apparently there was rumors that Niantic was going to be sold to a Saudi Arabia-backed company called Scopely Inc.
687664	688844	And apparently it is true.
689184	697407	They were sold to Scopely, which is owned by Savvy Games Group, which is a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.
698508	702489	They also hold 6.3% stake in Nintendo.
703630	705891	Apparently Niantic has reached an agreement to...
706591	717181	for Scopely to acquire them for $3.5 billion with an additional $350 million in cash from Niantic being distributed as part of a deal.
718442	723988	Toll value of $3.85 billion for Niantic equity holders.
726350	730474	Yeah, so interesting that they're owned by the Saudis now.
732096	738018	Well, and the makers of what, Monopoly Go, I think they bought Marvel Strike Force some time ago.
738138	745541	And, you know, a lot of folks in the player base of Pokemon Go have a lot of fear around this company taking over.
745901	749262	And when I say Pokemon Go, Pikmin, Monster Hunter, that's all in it too.
749282	752083	But we know Pokemon Go is the big one in the room, right?
752563	768625	and so a lot of people have a lot of fear about the amount of microtransactions that could be coming to the game because Scopely is kind of known for I wouldn't even say nickel and diming their users they're known for $99-ing their users that's the type of stuff we're talking about I okay
770655	798430	so I trash it I have a lot of thoughts when it comes to uh this because obviously I've been playing Niantic games a very long time and it started with a game called Ingress that I don't think a lot of people really talk about anymore but Ingress was the first Niantic game that you know the actual game that came out Niantic the first app I think that came out of Niantic was called Field Trip and it wasn't a game it was meant to find locations near you and then um uh
798490	799771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
805427	815509	to incentivize more people to submit things like Field Trip to really build up the database of local points of interest and interesting things that kind of gamified that whole thing.
816189	821330	And then, and I'm really cutting corners in this abridged little story about Niantic.
822290	828232	And then essentially some folks in Japan played Ingress that had connections to Pokemon.
828612	834773	And at the time Niantic was a Google subsidiary and that whole Google Maps Pokemon April Fool's joke happened.
835353	836014	and DarkSakura.com.
857592	859874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
880489	881189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
903177	903938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
923472	926173	I played Monster Hunter.
926493	927454	I've still played Pikmin.
927474	935176	I still think Pikmin is actually one of the best Niantic games because of how passive it is and how much it incentivizes walking and all that stuff.
937737	951722	I've played all those games over the years and here's my take on this whole thing is that the more I think about it, the less it actually surprises me because I don't think Niantic ever wanted to be in the video game business.
953206	961448	And I know that might sound very shocking for a company that made like one of the biggest games in... No, no, the biggest game in mobile game history.
961508	962528	Let's not mince words.
962568	964209	The biggest game in mobile game history.
964489	968110	Niantic became accidental billionaires with that game.
969490	973591	And I don't think they ever really wanted to be a gaming company.
974071	976232	And I think the first sign...
977403	978383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1006755	1008536	Well, isn't this interesting?
1009056	1012157	Niantic is now doubling down and basically saying, you know what?
1012577	1017838	All this gamification and all these games and things like that, it's in a place where it's kind of its own thing now.
1018259	1020619	We want to get back to exploring the world.
1021080	1024721	So they sold everything that's the games part over to Scopely.
1025601	1028702	And the interesting thing in all of this, they kept Ingress.
1029960	1031842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1049420	1049840	DarkSakura,
1068092	1068512	and DarkSakura.
1093470	1112623	I don't have a moral quandary with this I'm interested to see what they do because for the most part these sorts of things that Niantic does I find the most interesting I doubt any of you have ever checked out Scannaverse and I don't blame you it's not really a game but I think it's fucking fascinating some of the stuff they're doing with it
1113423	1115584	Um, let me put it like, this is what you can do.
1115664	1119005	You can scan something in 3D on your mobile phone.
1119385	1126688	So like one thing I did when I was in Nashville, there was a giant mural of Dolly Parton reading a book to a child.
1126768	1128828	And it was a portal in the game called Dolly Reads.
1129209	1130529	And I was like, this is really cool.
1130609	1132210	I'm going to do a little 3D scan of this.
1132370	1132790	So I did.
1132830	1132910	And
1133750	1134551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1159864	1166168	So I could scan, which kind of leads to weird copyright issues, but it's still an area we're exploring.
1166208	1170151	And if it's for personal use, it's one thing.
1170251	1175535	People scanning statues, and then now you can take that same data and 3D print statues.
1176395	1176655	and so on.
1201181	1203163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1220959	1224241	Maybe I shouldn't say that because we know Niantic has had their ups and downs, right?
1224481	1227582	They've had some pretty catastrophic botched launches, i.e.
1227662	1229843	Catan didn't happen, i.e.
1230063	1233405	NBA All World, Poopy, i.e.
1233545	1233845	what else?
1233965	1234526	What else did they?
1235266	1238708	Whatever Marvel fucking thing they were going to do, like never even fucking happened.
1239148	1247052	Obviously, they have had some very botched things along the way because I just don't think these guys knew how or wanted to run a gaming company.
1248450	1249330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1268065	1295621	we're fucked that's what that all goes to if you're a fan of Pikmin or Pokemon or Monster Hunter sorry kids we're fucked because now it's gonna be how do we make money off of this but there is I've seen all of the like danger scenarios of they're gonna charge you to even throw a Pokeball and have energy or even do gyms or they're gonna charge you for boosted shinies here's your one
1296121	1322748	Saving Grace in all three of those games is you have monetization and I'm sorry you do have monetization but you also have partnerships in especially in Pokemon Go and Pikmin and a notoriously difficult to work with organization in things like this and I'm talking about both the Pokemon company Pokemon Go and I'm talking about Nintendo Pikmin Bloom I'm talking about them both
1323954	1327095	for being notoriously difficult with these types of partnerships.
1327715	1333797	I think some of your disaster scenarios, I don't think a Pokemon company is going to let fly.
1333998	1335018	I think it's as simple as that.
1335938	1344321	But as far as all of these, remember when everybody was bitching and moaning and niantic about all of these changes and how things went bad and all that stuff?
1344881	1349423	I assure you, Scopely will not give a fuck
1350603	1353025	about those types of complaints.
1353745	1362812	And those sorts of things will be changed for the worse to benefit the dollar no matter what you have to say about it.
1364414	1366035	And that's my take on that.
1366896	1376443	I'm willing to keep entertaining those games and playing those games until that day comes, but the minute the day comes where the monetization gets out of hand, bitch, I'm out.
1377043	1377384	I'm out.
1378844	1379325	Uh, let's see.
1379725	1380746	Mike Deft in chat says,
1398544	1399364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1417308	1423451	Sure, I will agree with you that just because they're the Pokemon company doesn't mean they're not going to monetize completely.
1423991	1428733	And I think it's more of these quality of life changes that y'all bargained for with Niantic.
1429073	1431074	You're going to get a brick wall with Scopely.
1431514	1434995	I expect those changes to be reversed.
1435496	1437757	Expect the PokeStops to go back to 40 meters.
1438237	1441918	Expect all those things about accessibility and all that.
1442398	1444019	Scopely will not give a fuck.
1444199	1444859	I guarantee it.
1445440	1445980	Guarantee it.
1448038	1451759	So that's where I kind of see the changes happening there.
1452239	1454740	We have some other comments because y'all have some good stuff here in our chat.
1454960	1458462	Because again, we tape live on Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1459282	1462623	Sjohn Hunter Matt says, I don't know what Pogo is going to look like three years from now.
1462663	1465664	The only positives are they acquired the team and didn't lay anyone off.
1465824	1466244	I agree.
1466524	1467785	That is a huge positive.
1468805	1470285	That is a great thing to come out of this news.
1470806	1471446	I hope...
1472697	1473658	I need one of those things.
1491943	1498669	I know people that work in Niantic, and for their sake, they are very talented, very good people, and I really hope not.
1499169	1503453	But unfortunately, I feel like I've seen this song and dance before, Activision Blizzard Niantic.
1504734	1505835	What is wrong with my brain today?
1505955	1506896	I'm mixing all these things up.
1507036	1509699	Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is my case in point.
1511020	1511120	Um...
1514145	1518571	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob's burying the lead that he semi-predicted this a year or two ago.
1518651	1519392	Rob Stradamus.
1520533	1521094	That's right.
1521194	1523396	It was a New Year's prediction a couple years ago.
1523416	1524358	I'm almost positive.
1524658	1527581	So, you know, it happens.
1528122	1528923	Me predicting?
1528983	1529223	Who knew?
1530425	1531886	Me, Humble, of course, always.
1532947	1534308	Where were we?
1534609	1538773	On Matt's comment further, also, whatever ridiculous monetizations won't happen overnight.
1539113	1541155	The rest, we'll see what they do with the monetization.
1541495	1546240	If they monetize the catch rate or shiny rates of Pogo, then the fans will quit the app.
1546720	1551285	The Who, Saudi PIF that acquired them, can't be ignored here as well.
1551805	1551986	Okay.
1553208	1564799	Okay, since I'm riding a high on the prediction train, here is my prediction for how Scopely will monetize Pokemon Go that will not be popular with the fanbase.
1566701	1573182	The sale of this game is coming at a very interesting time because they're running out of Pokemon to add into the game.
1574042	1584124	They're running out of Pokemon that exist in, you know, I think there are still some Alola Pokemon and some Galar Pokemon still left to be added.
1584284	1587485	I think that's about all we're missing at this point, okay?
1588365	1592525	But we know there is likely a new Pokemon game in the horizon.
1592705	1594706	Oh yeah, we don't have all the Paldea Pokemon either.
1594806	1595066	Thank you.
1596124	1597444	They're drip feeding some of those.
1598644	1608886	My prediction is that instead of these Pokemon coming out for free with all of these events that are happening, there's going to be Pokemon expansion packs.
1609366	1618608	And you can bet your ass Generation 10 will be an expansion pack that you're going to have to pay money to get those Pokemon to show up in the world.
1619248	1621368	That is my little prediction.
1621428	1623989	Write it on a card that's going to piss people off.
1624289	1625709	Pokemon expansion packs.
1627108	1633314	They're already dabbling in that when it comes to boosted shinies, but they've never been really willing to cross that line.
1633714	1636717	I don't think Niantic was willing to cross that line with the player base.
1637097	1638578	Scopely will cross that line.
1638618	1641781	They're going to say there's already 600 Pokemon in this game for free.
1642061	1643142	You want the next 50?
1643423	1643803	Pay up.
1644764	1645545	$29.99 expansion pack.
1645585	1648167	Pokemon Astral Projection.
1649028	1650249	I don't know whatever they call it.
1652000	1655502	as you and her Matt also points out the battle season pass and that whole thing.
1655682	1659104	Oh, you can bet your ass that's continuing.
1659185	1664508	That was going to happen even if it stayed with Niantic because every game is turning up with a battle pass at some point.
1664828	1671652	That's my prediction for Pikmin is they're going to figure out how to do the battle pass of Pikmin because that's the one thing it's kind of missing.
1672373	1672533	So.
1674344	1681827	Anyway, and Mike Def says, if, like you said, the Pokemon Company International won't let that happen.
1684068	1688030	They allowed a monetization of extra Pokemon and Pokemon Unite and those things.
1688790	1690350	So I don't know.
1690911	1691371	I don't know.
1691831	1692891	It's only a prediction.
1692951	1694412	It doesn't mean I won't be wrong.
1694492	1695292	I'd love to be wrong.
1695693	1696953	I'd love for nothing to change.
1697473	1699874	I'd love for the monetization to just stay the way it is.
1700274	1701495	That game makes enough fucking money.
1703561	1704482	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1726560	1747553	I've dropped all the Niantic games so not really that's fair and I think I'm not playing it I figured that it's just any of these companies are eventually these games are going to be unless it's an indie studio that's operating with very low profits if it's a larger company these games are just going to turn to shit eventually it's just a matter of time yeah
1749529	1761264	Um, and as here's the interesting thing in all this, as far as the Ingress fans go, and there are thousands, no, there are a hundred, there are dozens of us that are hardcore Ingress fans out there.
1761284	1765670	And let me tell you, this news is best case scenario for us.
1766491	1767192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1785946	1790688	This was the best part because it's very hard to monetize Ingress.
1790768	1793949	But this way, they're going to find the monetization in data.
1794029	1800911	They're going to find monetization in other ways that they can sell, which they're already doing with what they're getting out of Scannaverse and other projects.
1801071	1806553	As far as Ingress goes, we're feeling fine on all this for now.
1806613	1810275	I mean, I guess we shouldn't get too cocky, but I feel like the Ingress player base is like, okay.
1811135	1812975	I will say, though, this is the weird part.
1813015	1814056	Sorry, I thought of something else.
1814861	1816642	This is the very weird part.
1819083	1827587	Amongst the Pokemon Go and the Monster Hunter and all this stuff, Wayfarer being a part of the sale does not make sense to me.
1828667	1831589	I do not understand why Niantic Wayfarer was part of the sale.
1832628	1832968	I don't.
1833469	1835710	Because Campfire I get.
1835990	1841373	And Campfire actually could be more interesting with the other Scopely games being worked into it.
1841393	1843314	I mean, good luck to them, I guess.
1843354	1844355	We'll see where that ends up.
1844855	1857843	But as far as Wayfarer goes, my thought was Pokemon Go and those other games would have ended up the same way as Harry Potter Wizards Unite.
1859534	1865299	Problematic author aside, from the game perspective, that game was not a Niantic game.
1865839	1871464	It was a Portkey Games game, which was a subsidiary of WB, which made all the Harry Potter games.
1871944	1874566	They only relied on Niantic for their...
1875487	1876428	Wayfarer Network.
1877028	1888897	And my full expectation was that Pokemon Go, Pikmin, would use that same partnership and then rely on the Wayfarer Network, which should, you would think, still be maintained by Niantic Spatial.
1889577	1891058	But that's not part of what's happening here.
1891418	1895842	Wayfarer is also going to Scopely, which to me is strange.
1896562	1900023	How's that working with Ingress then?
1900063	1901703	Because it's the same data.
1902143	1903703	We do not know.
1903783	1908264	The assumption among the fanbase is that the data will be forked.
1910004	1910725	That's not a pun.
1910945	1912165	I actually mean forked.
1912545	1916486	Meaning that at some point, whether that's January 1st, 26th, or whenever this deal closes.
1916506	1917966	Keep in mind, this isn't a closed deal yet.
1918366	1924327	Whenever this deal closes, then Scopely will have their database and Ingress will have their database.
1925151	1928292	Which, honestly, yay.
1928912	1935035	Can I tell you the worst thing that happened to the Ingress Portal Network was allowing Pokemon Go players to submit Pokestops?
1935515	1936435	And that's not a read.
1936615	1937656	I love Pokemon Go.
1937756	1938596	I love the players.
1938676	1947860	The problem is a PvP game and a PvE game have very different expectations for where there should be points of interest.
1949454	1976543	that was always a problem in Ingress let me tell you how many of us dozens of Ingress fans can't wait to start removing bullshit so I don't know I feel like the data is going to get forked and I mean actual fork not a pun but we do not know at this point what's going to happen for all we know Niantic starts getting their shit from Scopely
1978362	1980660	I hope not, I really hope not
1982076	2009061	but Niantic also has Scanaverse and that's a big thing Scanaverse is different from Wayfarer and there's the whole light ship which I think is now called Niantic Spatial and there's a whole other many of you don't ever see this but there's a whole other lightship.dev which I think is now Niantic Spatial there is a whole other copy of what you see on Wayfarer but with all the scanning data is there
2009861	2012161	So technically that data is already forked.
2012682	2018343	Niantic has a whole other system you just don't often see in that system that merges in with Wayfarer.
2018723	2020903	So I'm thinking that's just going to get split.
2021783	2022283	But we'll see.
2022383	2022663	We'll see.
2023284	2026724	SGO100Matt says, Rob hates Little Free Library Pokestops confirmed.
2027004	2029705	Yes, for the most part, I do hate Little Free Library Pokestops.
2030125	2033305	If the Little Free Library is at a park, a public park, I'm fine with it.
2033385	2036506	If the Little Free Library is in front of somebody's house, I don't care for it.
2038988	2041969	But in Pokemon, I'm all for it.
2042869	2044769	Let's have more Pokestops, not less.
2044909	2046790	But in Ingress, they're fucking annoying.
2047670	2049370	So, let's see.
2050531	2056052	S2100Matt says, I saw a Little Free Blockbuster library someone made where someone put a bunch of DVDs in there.
2056112	2056832	That's really funny.
2056872	2057332	That's cute.
2058012	2064554	One of my friends actually has a Little Free library that's art-based.
2065154	2068677	You go in there, it's little tiny art things that you can give and take.
2068737	2069738	It's really cute.
2069838	2071439	I thought it was a really clever idea.
2072540	2075642	PogCulture says, what if the park is in front of someone's house?
2075802	2076583	Then I'm fine with it.
2076643	2078625	Then good for you, you live in front of a park.
2079105	2084209	So yeah, if the Little Free Library is in the park boundary, I'm fine with it.
2084509	2087592	If it's in your house boundary across the street from the park, I'm not okay with it.
2087812	2088412	There's a difference.
2090073	2090214	So...
2091311	2093672	Alright, but anything in a park is fair game.
2093792	2095073	Everything in the park should be lit up.
2095113	2096014	I've always felt that way.
2098035	2109861	Alright, anyway, enough of me monologuing on Niantic, but when I tell you I have spent the last 10 years of my life playing Ingress, this kind of news is, you know, it's a big deal.
2110562	2111863	So we'll see what happens in the next year.
2113964	2114404	Let's move on.
2114444	2117826	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2117886	2118886	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2118927	2119547	How was your gaming week?
2121397	2125300	Of course I played, well actually I don't think I played any Dead by Daylight this week.
2125380	2128343	No, I played some on Sunday, of course, after the show last week.
2128363	2129484	I was going to say, okay.
2129844	2143337	But I took the time off because Smokey, who is a big jerk, gave me 5,000 bits to buy Monster Hunter Wilds.
2145719	2148280	Oh, yes, I'm so I haven't been able to catch these streams.
2148320	2149241	I'm so curious.
2149801	2150262	So curious.
2150462	2151522	It's complicated.
2151683	2155785	I mean, it's a lot to get used to and I don't like that.
2157406	2164351	And I guess since it's just like an always online live experience that you can't actually pause the game.
2167600	2194306	you've got like your menus that pop up over like all the other things that you do but I'm having fun so far and I'm enjoying it you know once I'm getting used to it I wish I had a lot more free exploration I could do instead of follow these people I mean it's it's getting there it's growing on me so I'll be playing it on Friday nights I think because I'm on my third playthrough of Dragon Age the Veil Guard
2195726	2199489	I mean, I'm still super enjoying Dragon Age as well.
2199649	2202311	So there's that.
2202471	2211478	And then I tried to start... I was bringing back Retro Knight, and I started to play the Nintendo 64 Dobutsu no Mori as an Animal Forest or Animal Crossing.
2212399	2213440	And the game locked on me.
2214461	2215522	And I hadn't saved yet.
2217863	2219124	I didn't make it very far.
2219285	2220666	I had just met all my neighbors.
2221486	2223648	But I had some of the best neighbors.
2223728	2224629	I had Daisy.
2226846	2234209	and I had Eloise and I told everybody about Dina who I wish would, you know, come back.
2235729	2236930	Dina was our town lesbian.
2238890	2240111	Are you muted?
2241171	2241371	Am I?
2241431	2241932	Yes, I am.
2241992	2243152	Sorry, I hit my button on accident.
2243972	2245793	Dina was the lesbian anteater, right?
2246033	2247994	Or at least canonically in your town.
2248734	2249254	Oh, she was a duck?
2249294	2250215	I thought she was an anteater.
2250555	2252916	She was a green duck who had the gym equipment.
2253396	2253756	Oh, okay.
2255000	2257442	and then she left my village for yours.
2259304	2259784	Sorry.
2261265	2262286	I'm not sorry.
2263567	2268551	We even put pride flags and everything outside of her house to show her how much we supported her.
2269852	2271954	Anyway, so that happened.
2272394	2273415	Can I tell a story?
2275336	2284384	Do you remember when we got a villager to say a very nasty word beginning with C and we got it to move to somebody's village that really did not like that word?
2287621	2291044	That person had to work forever to erase that word.
2291064	2293446	And everyone said it.
2293726	2294547	It spread.
2298130	2300852	And now it's so funny because now it's in Eurovision.
2300892	2310880	Like there's literally that song going, I'm serving Kant, except it's the Maltesian word for singing and not, you know, anything else.
2311001	2311261	Anyway.
2311724	2312144	What is that?
2312164	2312744	Cuntology 101?
2313744	2314545	Pretty much.
2315465	2317385	I mean, that's a real song and I super love it.
2318126	2320306	Is that the... That's a different song.
2320426	2322867	C-U-N-T I want to do what's best for me.
2322947	2323627	I'm cunty.
2324387	2327228	You need to hear that song called I'm Serving Cunt.
2327408	2328388	Do-do-do-do-do.
2328708	2329628	Do-do-do-do-do.
2329768	2331989	Do-re-mi-fa-so-so Serving Cunt.
2332369	2333049	It's so good.
2333069	2333669	All right.
2334089	2337370	I'm looking... It's going to go in my play... You realize it's going to go in my playlist, right?
2337490	2338010	As it should.
2338310	2339351	My streaming playlist.
2339391	2340231	I'm going to type how to...
2341895	2349885	I don't remember the name of the artist, but it's Malta's entry into Eurovision.
2352107	2352348	Anyway.
2353311	2353611	All right.
2354192	2354592	Okay.
2354792	2356494	Oh, it's called Kant.
2356874	2357094	Yes.
2357855	2358516	I'll say it like that.
2358816	2359036	Yeah.
2359396	2359697	Okay.
2359777	2362459	But when she sings it, it don't sound like that.
2363620	2373548	But make sure you get the actual version called Kant and not because they did a Eurovision safe edit called Serving because Eurovision wouldn't let them do it with the full word.
2373568	2374429	They're like, it doesn't matter.
2374449	2377331	I have a Mariana Conte.
2378618	2378998	Is that it?
2380719	2381179	I don't know.
2381739	2382979	I'll send you the video after the show.
2383080	2383740	I'll just text it to you.
2384300	2387001	Small Shay in chat says, what did I just hear Rob say?
2387101	2387741	I'm barely awake.
2387801	2388701	Never mind.
2388821	2389722	It was all a dream, Shay.
2389762	2390202	Go back to bed.
2390222	2391502	Have some more coffee, Shay.
2391542	2392663	Have some more coffee, Shay.
2394063	2394283	Okay.
2395224	2398525	Oh yes, this all started with Animal Crossing and your villagers serving.
2399745	2401026	Yeah, they were totally serving it.
2401386	2401706	Anyway.
2404122	2407463	So yeah, so I ended up looking at shutting down.
2408263	2412125	I ended up trying to find another game to play.
2412465	2417848	So I just randomly pulled up Devil's Crush for TurboGrafx.
2419505	2427590	Played a little bit of Devil's Crush and then I pulled up... I was going to play the NES Fantasy Zone.
2427810	2429711	No, not the NES one, but the TurboGrafx Fantasy Zone.
2430051	2430872	I was like, screw that.
2430912	2433853	I have Super Fantasy Zone for the Genesis Mega Drive.
2433873	2435174	So I played a little bit of that.
2436195	2441678	And then I was going to play a little bit of Threads of Fate, which in Japan was called Dew Prism.
2442999	2444159	It's a cute little RPG.
2444220	2445240	I was totally into it.
2446941	2447962	And then I was like, wait...
2448692	2451253	People have been wanting me to, why don't I just?
2451333	2453054	So I did Cult of the Lamb for a while.
2454935	2463680	And then, yeah, so I think, and I'm so mad because I had graphics and everything for Animal Crossing and it looked really good.
2464140	2465340	And I was so happy.
2465440	2468722	My little chat room said, Dobutsu no Mori Chattonumu.
2469983	2472444	And I even redid like the graphics to make it look the same.
2472484	2474185	I was so annoyed.
2474545	2478207	And it was also the premiere of my new retro night graphics.
2479937	2480558	Annoyed!
2480979	2481481	Annoyed!
2483225	2488097	RetroNight is back on hold until I think of something else.
2492040	2494702	Alright, I found the video for you and I put it in chat.
2494962	2495182	Okay.
2497004	2497504	Let's see.
2498005	2502508	I tried to find the unedited one because the number one hit is the Eurovision stage.
2502528	2503229	That's the artist.
2503249	2504109	That's the one I found.
2504169	2505190	Okay, that's the one.
2507212	2507792	Let's go to Loki.
2507812	2508493	How was your gaming week?
2508533	2509173	Were you serving?
2511315	2511815	Serving?
2511995	2512256	Yes.
2513917	2515638	No, I was playing Minecraft.
2515958	2517480	Oh, Minecraft was not the serve.
2518520	2520282	Not the serve, not the tea.
2520302	2520622	Okay.
2521138	2522680	Not the T-Hunty, no god.
2524322	2524582	No.
2525743	2528467	No, I was, yeah, I was playing Minecraft this week.
2529047	2532191	Um, as usual, I put out a video earlier this week.
2532531	2535014	I have been working on another one.
2535995	2540941	Um, trying to get, like, somewhat weekly content, but I don't think it's going to stay like that because, um,
2541516	2542076	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2560740	2562701	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2580427	2581948	And then I'm anticipating the patch.
2582028	2584070	We finally know that there is a patch coming on the 25th.
2584110	2586511	There was a little bit of news on that this week.
2587092	2589473	And that should kind of pump a little more energy into the game.
2589813	2592715	I must admit, I've been a little meh on 14 in general.
2593396	2596158	I haven't been playing it as much, but I do love...
2596738	2598839	to collect cosmetics and all that bullshit.
2599119	2601861	And so when there's a Moogle Tome event, I'm usually all in on that.
2602081	2602922	So there is that.
2604122	2610906	Of course, I don't always talk about it, but like at the top of the show, I've been playing a lot of, you know, Ingress, Pikmin, Pokemon, all of it.
2611446	2619651	I will say my walking ever since Daylight Savings and that it's lighter out again, and I have a newer walking buddy that's been like accountability buddy that's been helping too.
2620872	2624334	I have gotten like 10,000 steps in the last week every day.
2624694	2650259	and I kind of want to keep that trend going just to you know for health and all that stuff and it's been great for Pikmin so whenever Bobby does listen to this I carried us on that challenge this week but that's the motive that's I'm saying that tongue-in-cheek because there's been weeks I've been carried like the week I had COVID but I've been very trying to get back into you know using that as motivation to move and do all that good stuff so yeah been having fun with that now one other thing I will mention
2651431	2651991	Pandora's Box
2676670	2677251	Space Harrier
2704201	2705261	Yay!
2705981	2706962	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
2707642	2708022	Get ready.
2708242	2711843	Now granted, this was a little bit after a bunch of Neo Geo games.
2712923	2716084	My friend was like, did you know that there was a Double Dragon fighting game?
2716124	2717424	I'm like, yeah, let's play it.
2717724	2718845	So we played that for a little bit.
2719445	2724006	And then I was like, okay, if you're going to make me play Neo Geo fighting games, we will be playing Fatal Fury Special.
2724566	2726727	So we played a little bit of that too, because that's one of my favorites.
2727227	2728507	Boy, did I get bad at that game.
2728547	2731428	And then we were playing King of Fighters, which...
2732068	2733129	Don't ask me which one.
2733169	2741615	Because again, with this thing having a shit ton of runs, it was like, I know it was like King of Fighters 94, 95, 96, 97, 2000, 2001, Mark of the Wolves.
2741675	2742035	I don't know.
2742055	2744277	Just like, I think it was King of Fighters 97.
2744417	2746379	I want to say is what we were playing.
2747199	2749420	And then it was like, let's look at random retro games.
2749460	2751201	This is the third one.
2751261	2752262	It was one of the earlier ones.
2752802	2754943	And then it was like, let's look at random retro games.
2755003	2756424	And Space Harrier came up.
2756744	2760206	My friend was actually the one that was like, oh my god, have you ever seen Space Harrier?
2760306	2763768	And I was like, bitch, have I ever seen Space Harrier?
2765288	2766329	How old is your friend?
2767770	2769130	Maybe about seven years younger than me.
2769691	2771292	Like late 30s.
2771452	2773693	And does your friend know about the podcast?
2773713	2773933	No.
2774477	2775839	Yes, but I don't think has listened.
2776621	2779646	So... But, I mean, the simple fact...
2781471	2782231	I know, I know.
2782271	2783992	We're on a gaming podcast.
2784132	2790375	I know, but it's one of those things that I seriously think most... A lot of my friends... Keep in mind, I don't talk about my podcast all the time.
2790715	2791436	I'm proud of it.
2791516	2796318	I will share it with friends, but I don't share it in person hanging out at parties all the time.
2796338	2797479	So I think a lot of people forget.
2797759	2799079	It's just like me hosting shows.
2799239	2801040	A lot of people forget that I do that too.
2801260	2806263	And then it's like, you know, oh, yeah, one of my friends was at the Colonial last week and said they saw you.
2806343	2807663	I'm like, yeah, it's something I do.
2808143	2808304	So...
2809494	2814678	Anyway, S2100 Matt in chat says, have you heard of a thing called a Zune, Grandpa?
2815359	2815779	Oh, yes.
2816019	2816380	Oh, yes.
2818081	2818542	Let's see.
2818662	2819182	I'm looking at.
2819382	2819783	Yeah.
2820003	2820203	What?
2820783	2822365	I actually have two 8-tracks.
2822465	2823446	You know what one of them is?
2823566	2824667	Please say it's ABBA.
2825267	2828029	I'm going to guess if any other albums are rival.
2829771	2830812	No, it's Fleetwood Mac.
2831667	2832768	Oh, that's still a good one, though.
2832888	2833368	That's still good.
2833468	2834048	It's Rumors.
2834368	2835609	Okay, that's a good 8-track to have.
2836209	2836770	What's the other one?
2838491	2843433	But that was actually, like, I used to have the physical album as a kid, and it's one of the ones that got lost in the hurricane.
2843813	2844173	Oh, man.
2844414	2844694	You know what?
2844714	2847135	I would listen to Rhiannon on repeat.
2847535	2848876	I want to collect 8-tracks.
2849836	2851877	All these fucking kids today collecting vinyl?
2852418	2853758	No, no kids.
2853898	2856180	There's a reason no one fucking collects 8-tracks.
2856220	2857020	You want to know why?
2857040	2858261	We're going galaxy-brained.
2858541	2859041	Get in the car.
2859081	2859982	We're collecting 8-tracks.
2860262	2860442	Why?
2861943	2865864	Have you ever actually physically in your life played an 8-track?
2865924	2867345	Yes, my grandma had one.
2868425	2871326	And have you ever seen what happens to your tapes?
2871406	2875108	If one little thing goes bad, they are worse to fix than cassettes.
2875308	2876408	That's why we have pencils.
2876828	2879029	No, I know, I know, they're a bitch.
2879429	2880550	No, I know, I know, it's a joke.
2880570	2883671	You kind of do fix them with a pencil, actually, but not like you would with a cassette.
2885512	2889213	Okay, children, for those who don't know, 8-tracks...
2890919	2891540	are fucking old.
2891601	2891881	The end.
2891941	2892242	Let's go.
2892382	2893044	Yes, they are.
2894888	2895228	All right.
2897373	2899477	Remember when video games were on cassette?
2900683	2900963	Yes.
2901103	2902944	Look out, Grandpa Rob's on the prowl.
2903004	2920768	Let's talk about the Commodore 64 cassette player so you could play the slinky video game on a cassette after it took 60 minutes, 60 goddamn minutes to play that cassette into your memory on the Commodore 64.
2922148	2929310	Literally, you're letting your Commodore 64 listen to music and then it loads it into the memory and then there you go.
2930745	2933006	Rob, I got one further for you.
2933086	2933867	Oh boy, I can't wait.
2934767	2940611	Coleco Adam, where the power supply was as big as your house.
2941071	2943833	No, it was like the printer of the power supply.
2943873	2945774	Something would run through the cassette deck.
2946955	2951717	And if you had any sort of power surge, you could kiss your cassettes goodbye.
2952838	2957661	That is why Coleco Adam cassettes that actually work are money.
2961479	2962460	And I lived in Alabama.
2963100	2963741	Put the two together.
2964101	2967643	In chat, SSJ100Matt says, clue VCR game for the win.
2967863	2968884	Oh, 100%.
2969784	2971925	Let's bring back VHS games.
2972165	2972706	Let's do it.
2974298	2974738	You know what?
2974818	2977359	The government's trying to ban VHS cleaner.
2977639	2984662	They're trying to ban video cleaner because there's totally not another use for video head cleaner that anybody should know about.
2985822	2987123	But the government's trying to ban it.
2987163	2992065	So therefore, in response, we need to bring back video cassettes and VCR games.
2992845	2994666	And the Clue VCR game is where we start.
2997162	2999146	That's when I knew Bobby Blackwolf was good people.
2999226	3004035	When I saw Bobby Blackwolf owned not only Clue, the VCR game, but Clue 2, Murder in Disguise,
3005151	3006592	I knew Bobby Blackwolf was good people.
3007232	3010113	That's why we've been working with him for 20 years.
3010853	3012954	Because I just clue VCR game.
3013774	3016015	Alright, let's move on.
3016095	3018296	I'm just reading what QuestBuster is saying.
3018336	3019116	How big is that game?
3019376	3019957	9 megabytes?
3020057	3021157	No, it's only 9 kilobytes.
3021197	3023078	How did you guys even play anything?
3023658	3028440	I keep thinking about this story that my friend Krista's dad talked about being an engineer.
3029240	3032603	and, like, was it the late 40s, early 50s, something like that?
3033183	3041550	About them lining a room with magnets to make 1K of memory.
3041890	3047354	That's why those old-ass Atari games are so impressive.
3047454	3053058	When you consider, like, how much they pack into such tiny space is wild.
3054199	3054920	Oh, no, totally.
3054940	3055020	Yeah.
3055743	3081171	and then like you go and then read about like the 16-bit era how they were trying to you know they made the special chips for the games and increased ram for the games and you basically were running part of the hardware for the console on the on the cartridge you know they were an expansion pack as well as a game that's crazy stuff
3082723	3087286	SSU100 Matt in chat says, what was that one creepy VCR game with the creepy guy yelling at you?
3087326	3088586	I believe it was called Nightmare.
3089627	3092968	And that's when the guy would randomly pop on the screen and go like, Maggot!
3093308	3094069	Maggot!
3094229	3095029	What did you call me?
3095269	3100732	No, it's, but, you know, that was what was scary in the 80s was that stuff.
3100772	3101472	It's called Nightmare.
3102332	3106814	I just had the videotape of How to Beat Games and it was the Metal Gear one.
3109015	3109916	And I just watched it.
3110859	3117186	I mean, little did I know that people would make, you know, entire entertainment genres out of those.
3117286	3119007	I was just watching those because they were cool.
3119588	3125054	That and it also finally got me how I could beat Top Gun because I could never refuel my plane well.
3125314	3128097	I swear to God, those VHS games came and went in a year.
3128337	3129118	Like 1984, they were everywhere.
3129138	3129358	1985, gone.
3132721	3133862	It's just wild how that works.
3133902	3134102	All right.
3134142	3135162	Anyway, we got a game.
3135462	3137203	Let's, you know, we're- It's games.
3137283	3137703	It counts.
3138184	3138564	Yeah, I know.
3138604	3139284	We're talking about the game.
3139304	3139904	It was a video element.
3140004	3145127	We are talking about games from the 1980s, but let's talk about games in 2025 and beyond.
3145467	3151810	Real quick before I turn it over to Loki for our first story, I do want to mention to the folks in chat, because I forgot to acknowledge it earlier, I want to say thank you.
3152150	3156772	I don't usually acknowledge all the bits and subs live because we are trying to do a podcast feed, but-
3157372	3161275	We had a very special golden hype train earlier.
3161315	3164196	And those don't happen every... It's like the shinies of hype trains.
3164597	3167579	So we actually had a golden hype train that turned up earlier.
3167939	3170801	So I hope you all collected your golden kappas from that.
3170841	3173142	Thank you all for your generosity and support.
3173182	3174383	It really does mean the world to us.
3174403	3175004	We appreciate it.
3175584	3177685	Okay, Loki, why don't you start us off with 2025 gaming news?
3179676	3182599	Yes, so 2025 Gaming News.
3182739	3191787	And this is, I don't think this is too surprising considering the landscape that we have right now with the Steam Deck and some of these other personal handheld gaming devices.
3192563	3222147	but apparently Microsoft is working on releasing one of their own it's actually going to be a reskinned partner PC gaming handheld device running a new software layer not a full-blown Xbox gaming device but it will be something that is essentially running either some sort of Xbox streaming or Xbox powered games, maybe emulation or something like that um
3223302	3233891	They said they're calling it Codename Kennen and it's supposed to, you know, feature like similar stuff you would expect with like an Xbox, you know, the guide button.
3233931	3242959	They're going to have, you know, possible like Series X and S generation type games on there.
3244051	3255392	I don't know, it'll be interesting to see what they come up with certainly I think there are some Xbox games that PC games are probably compatible with the
3258294	3275501	even the Steam Deck right now 100% I can imagine that quite a few things could run on there at the very least at Xbox Series S quality and I'm sure you can get a lot more with the games streaming through xCloud and stuff like that 100%
3278058	3278618	We'll see.
3278999	3286003	Right now, the rumor is that Asus is the one making the Kennen device.
3286083	3288465	So, of course, they have their own ROG.
3288865	3292547	I forget what their handheld's called, but the Strix?
3292928	3293968	Maybe it's not the Strix.
3294649	3296590	But, yeah, one of the ROG ones that they have.
3296630	3300052	They have a handheld of their own that's very similar to the Steam Deck.
3300092	3303134	So, I guess we'll wait and see.
3304615	3307117	It's supposed to be coming out this year, though, at some point.
3308331	3315873	Yeah, I think maybe maybe Games Summer Games Fest, you know, now it's been released or something like that.
3316513	3318934	This is I think this is so good for Microsoft.
3319014	3319634	I really do.
3319754	3321655	This is a really good direction for them.
3321695	3325936	My only reservation is that we're going to have a lot of portable shit pretty soon.
3326336	3329917	Like I can already see my nightstand now is going to have a Steam Deck on it.
3329997	3332618	It's going to have one of these on it and it's going to have a Switch 2 on it.
3333158	3336720	So I maybe worry a slight bit about handheld fatigue.
3337201	3344165	But I also think just from like my only concern about this is I think Microsoft should have done this about three years ago, to be quite honest.
3344205	3346907	I think they let Steam Deck beat them to the punch too much.
3347347	3348307	But this is so smart.
3348388	3349648	It's not just for Game Pass.
3350029	3353611	The majority of Game Pass games are not things like Avowed.
3353931	3358614	And even Avowed, like you said, like in an Xbox S quality will probably run fine.
3358974	3359895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3378493	3393593	and it's not just the Game Pass stuff that you download and install on your own system but now cloud gaming whether that be in your own house on Wi-Fi or if they've timed this right in a few years when 5G becomes more prevalent although
3394534	3397396	I feel like I've been saying that for about 10 years.
3397897	3406864	So I'm starting to wonder if that is really going to happen because I thought by now we would be in a world where there was faster over-the-air internet than cable internet.
3407024	3408585	Maybe not fiber, but cable internet.
3409165	3411287	And that's not quite where we're at yet.
3411788	3412868	No, it's not.
3412908	3417152	I'm not sure what's really holding it up, if it's a lack of competition or whatever the case may be.
3417252	3419834	But yeah, it doesn't seem to be getting...
3421206	3422567	Faster at all, actually.
3422647	3431275	I don't think I've seen any sort of... Well, when tariffs are going to make the tech even more important to import, you can just kiss that shit goodbye, but that's another topic.
3433717	3434797	For no reason, mind you.
3434978	3435158	None.
3436360	3456513	well yeah data caps I don't think are a thing as E3VL mentioned in the sense that I don't think a lot of plans have data caps but they do have certainly data caps in the sense of speed like they'll be like yeah you can use all the internet you want but after 20 gigabytes of data we're gonna throttle that shit
3457153	3459616	You're going to be living back in the 2G land.
3475234	3496065	but you know a handheld device that could do cloud gaming through 5G so you could literally do it anywhere without having to do these big installs and stuff would be huge you know I don't know how far away we are realistically from that but I feel like Xbox getting into this system positions them for that because they can still do all the cloud gaming now too through Xbox
3497301	3497381	Yeah.
3497401	3497481	Yeah.
3523433	3526036	Shove it full of emulation stuff.
3526076	3526517	There you go.
3526897	3528659	Thousands of games you can put on there.
3529960	3531742	But yeah, I don't know.
3531883	3543876	Like the classroom and stuff just never even now doesn't seem interesting to me just because of the environment that we are in right now where high speed internet is limited in some capacity or
3544424	3567812	whether you know we like it or not and we don't have those like you know multi megabit uh gigabit connections or whatever you know multi gigabit connections up and down over the air over you know cable internet or whatever it may be fiber we just don't have that everywhere yet it's not we're not living in that type of environment
3568260	3568440	Yeah.
3570240	3570581	All right.
3571021	3572261	Well, let's move on.
3572981	3580703	While we see what develops with that, I think you are on the right track that if they are going to announce something, Summer Game Fest, that sort of window, especially in the absence of E3.
3581143	3583764	Although, don't we have a new thing now?
3583884	3586764	I remember we talked about that, that it's E3 without the show floor.
3587204	3588345	Is that a thing that's going to happen?
3588465	3590725	I don't know if that's going to include conferences.
3590805	3591706	I wouldn't assume it would.
3591846	3592926	I highly doubt it will.
3592966	3593426	Yeah.
3595723	3596083	Okay.
3596403	3596723	I don't know.
3596763	3597244	I don't know.
3597864	3599444	GDC's coming up this week, right?
3599464	3600765	GDC's this coming weekend, right?
3600825	3601405	Or did we miss it?
3601845	3603405	No, I think it's this coming weekend is GDC.
3604966	3610228	Because I seem to remember one of our buddies that does an ancillary event was promoting it for this Thursday.
3610688	3613489	So I think GDC's this coming week.
3613849	3614549	And you never know.
3615069	3618170	We don't get a lot of gaming announcements out of GDC.
3618230	3619390	It's not that kind of event.
3619430	3620251	I think you all know that.
3620311	3623492	But once in a while, we get hardware.
3624432	3626353	Like, Sony's announced some hardware there.
3626413	3630235	You know, it could, but I wouldn't set the expectation there.
3630275	3632056	But it could be a nice little present.
3633016	3636878	SSU100Matt says, should bring back Game Room for it to be the UI.
3638146	3639807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3661517	3663678	Konami did a whole little preview of this game.
3664398	3681504	And I think probably the striking difference at first is that instead of having that more like classic New England kind of look of a Silent Hill, you know, traditional game or like a Centralia, Pennsylvania type of look that Silent Hill games have traditionally had, this one is set in 1960s Japan.
3681924	3683825	So it definitely looks a lot different.
3684785	3702331	and instead of maybe the weird like blood and like copper rusty look that Silent Hill has usually when it transforms in this one it looks like it's a little more like floral type of looking and all this I don't know there's a specific thing about the kind of flowers they use oh
3703291	3703531	What's that?
3703551	3703671	Mm-hmm.
3703691	3703892	Mm-hmm.
3703912	3704052	Mm-hmm.
3729361	3752597	um so so yeah that's why this flower is you know important it's significant because it's associated with death reincarnation and mourning uh SSJ100 Matt in chat says Silent Hill fork Matt Matt I say this from the bottom of my heart fork you all right uh
3754162	3756304	Anyway, we know the character in this game.
3756645	3768736	Shimizu Hinako is going to be the main character, a teenage girl that you're going to be playing as in the game, which for those of you watching us live on Twitch, as we're taping live on this Sunday night, we're playing a little bit of the trailer that they sort of put out with this.
3769676	3773000	We also, you know, add some more further comments from folks that are working on this.
3773340	3779626	A lot of folks that are kind of like lifetime fans of Silent Hill, like a lot of people in these quotes saying, I played Silent Hill 20 years ago.
3780166	3781587	I love the Silent Hill series.
3781827	3786068	So Akira Yamaoka is the composer credited here saying,
3810078	3811839	I need to see how her name is spelled.
3813340	3815142	S-H-I-M-I-Z-U No, no.
3815662	3817883	No, I'm talking about the kanji used in Hinako.
3817903	3818664	Oh, oh, oh.
3821366	3824948	Because standardly Hinako would mean like sun child.
3825328	3829631	But I keep thinking of like the Hina Matsuri or the dolls festival.
3829971	3830191	Yeah.
3830452	3830652	Yeah.
3831587	3832188	Anyway, I don't know.
3832228	3835472	Like the trailer was the I did not watch the entire thing.
3835652	3841339	And I don't know, like some of the Silent Hill fans in my life were kind of reacting very tepidly to it.
3841479	3844182	But I like this trailer.
3844342	3849949	I mean, I can see where it's like it doesn't look exactly like a Silent Hill game, but I'm cool with them like trying something different.
3850409	3851210	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3874485	3877166	Heaven forbid they're ballsy enough to call it Silent Hills.
3878146	3879126	Have the nerve.
3879566	3881106	Have the nerve, Bloober.
3881206	3881566	Do it.
3881726	3886947	Have the nerve to release a game called Silent Hills after everything that's happened in this world.
3887207	3887567	Do it.
3890668	3891628	But I think it'll be interesting.
3894289	3894769	Oh, interesting.
3894789	3900530	Mike Deft makes a little pun saying Silent Hill F, but with the I-V-E in quotes going Silent Hill 5.
3903902	3908098	I remembered, there was some leak stuff on this before, wasn't there?
3910174	3917696	I felt like most of the leaks ended up being that free-to-play game that came out with all the cyberbullying subplot and all that stuff.
3918016	3920416	I've seen some of this before.
3921416	3930098	Oh, well, they announced Silent Hill F a while ago, but all we got was that conceptual floral monster-looking thing, and we didn't get a lot.
3930198	3932438	We just knew it was going to be Silent Hill in Japan.
3932819	3935619	This gives us way more of what it actually looks like.
3936219	3939620	It makes me wonder if the town that they're in translates to Silent Hill.
3941097	3941698	Mmm, maybe.
3943119	3943379	Maybe.
3943459	3943960	Just saying.
3945281	3948583	DarkTetsuya says, Aw, you're really gonna do Kojima like that?
3949244	3949424	Look.
3950472	3954114	Kojima, Kojima is not exactly like having a bad time.
3954895	3957637	He's got Death Stranding 2 happening real soon.
3958237	3962160	He's got that other game that with all the people screaming with Udo Kier and that.
3962420	3963421	What the fuck was that called?
3963501	3963901	Overdose.
3964281	3965182	He's got that going on.
3965222	3967784	Like, Kojima is going to be just fine.
3968064	3968624	Don't you worry.
3969325	3970585	Don't you worry, Dark Tetsuya.
3971186	3972327	Kojima is going to be A-OK.
3975202	3976283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4004062	4027823	Konami Arcade stuff still chugging along and still got its fans like Konami whatever was holding them back the managers appear to have been sacked so good for them let's move on to some bad decisions in gaming DarkSakura bad decision was gulping down this meatball
4028837	4030257	Oh no, that's never a bad decision.
4030297	4032118	Maybe the timing, but meatballs are great.
4032198	4032438	Yeah.
4034059	4035319	Other than it getting kind of stuck.
4036039	4042441	I had the best meatball in my entire fucking life in Florida after getting off that cruise.
4042921	4043841	We went to this diner.
4044802	4047623	But it was like an upscale, fancy-ass diner in the middle of Miami.
4048243	4050003	Jamie, those meatballs.
4052204	4054185	And I've had a lot of balls in my mouth over the years.
4054925	4055425	Meatballs!
4055445	4055785	Meatballs!
4056745	4060628	I feel that they never compared to my friend's Sicilian grandmother.
4061128	4061868	Well, it's nothing.
4062129	4065571	He made meatballs the size of a softball.
4065731	4067692	Nothing is ever going to top home cooking.
4068492	4068953	But anyway.
4069293	4071114	Especially a Sicilian grandmother.
4072875	4073155	All right.
4073275	4073596	Anyway.
4073716	4073936	Anyway.
4074596	4083722	So there was a leak from Horizon Forbidden West with the main character Aloy as an A.I.,
4086549	4092414	It was a Sony employee talking to an AI version of the character.
4097858	4106165	But the character who voiced her, Ashley Burch, was basically...
4107873	4110197	Unhappy with some of the things.
4110457	4114604	Like what she said is that she... I'll just read what her quote is.
4115064	4121955	I saw the tech demo earlier this week and the demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development.
4122516	4122616	Um...
4124927	4149672	and also uh Sony didn't use uh any of her performance so she says none of my facial or voice data Gorilla owns Aloy as a character um then she goes on to say I feel worried not worried about Gorilla specifically or Horizon or my performance or my career specifically even I feel worried about this art form game performance is an art form and then um
4151397	4158264	She was talking about the SAG-AFTRA strikes and said that we're asking for protections.
4158344	4163528	What we're fighting for is you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form.
4164009	4168053	You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you're using this AI double.
4169981	4196796	and she said she doesn't feel worried because of the technology existing but just what people could do with it and so they want people to be protected and have a way to fight back so another quote from her that I really like this says I want to be able to continue to do this job and if we don't win then that future is really compromised I'm genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on Blast certainly not Guerrilla
4197276	4200358	because, again, I don't think the technology is the problem.
4201918	4204340	Game companies wanting to use the technology isn't the problem.
4204380	4209862	The problem is we are currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.
4211243	4216586	Fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much.
4218186	4219367	And, yeah, I agree with that.
4219567	4219707	Same.
4219747	4219887	Yeah.
4222751	4236494	I mean, and this is coming after, you know, the whole thing about Microsoft Muse, their generative AI, and just more... It's... I don't know.
4237614	4238655	There's more going on.
4238735	4249117	There's, you know, what she was referring to with what's going on with the strike and trying to negotiate and the...
4250757	4270103	The opposing party not be willing to give protections is that the studios were including some pretty big loopholes in their bargains.
4273859	4298106	they actually just put out a memo saying there were alarming loopholes that will never that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse which is pretty much what started this whole thing to begin with they are really far apart in coming to any kind of agreement
4301005	4310651	It's really... The studios care about money in any way they can to get it.
4311812	4314133	And voice actors are a tool for them.
4315654	4317715	And not people doing their job.
4320377	4320617	So...
4322799	4351241	but right now some of the studios that they're involved in the negotiations is Disney Character Voices, Activision Blizzard, EA, Warner Brothers, Insomniac, a few others and they said that they had tentative agreements on 24 out of 25 proposals but the SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director their chair Sarah, I'm going to mispronounce this Emily
4352362	4362227	wrote out to the members very recently that the last proposals wouldn't allow the studios to use union members past performances and outside performances without any of the protections that were bargained for.
4362927	4364528	So they're still waiting to get back on that.
4364668	4366009	It's just, it's a bunch of...
4367837	4369759	There's a lot going on, there's a lot going on
4391441	4398186	and most of these strikes that we've heard about in other areas, whether it was the writer's strike, blah, blah, blah, were settled within 90 days.
4398266	4399327	And I really worry.
4399587	4412396	This Aloy demo, and I'm sure a lot of you saw it, and I saw it too, it has me worried because I feel like this is the game companies really trying to sort of put out there that, oh, well, we don't need the voice actors.
4412796	4419261	We can do this with the AI and everything, but let me tell you, and I'm sure many of you saw the demo as well, and I did,
4419841	4425324	I don't know about y'all, but I was heavily reminded of something else we've seen before.
4426425	4428826	Who remembers Milo?
4429667	4430848	Does anyone remember Milo?
4432809	4433789	What was Milo, Loki?
4433909	4434310	Do you remember?
4435339	4441645	Milo was the stupid Peter Molyneux thing that they were pushing with the Kinect that was just going to revolutionize everything.
4441705	4459923	It was going to be like a real child that you've captured and kidnapped in your own console, and you get to talk to it, and it would have feelings, and it would recognize you, and all this stuff that Peter Molyneux was blowing out his ass because he always promises shit that he can't fucking deliver on all the time, and we now know that he's a fucking liar, but you know what?
4460003	4461283	Well, you know what?
4461523	4463824	Let's give the man credit where it's due.
4464404	4467045	Because he was 10 years ahead of the curve on this.
4467405	4472526	Because let me tell you, I had the same fucking reaction to the Aloy video that I did to Project Milo.
4473026	4473266	Huh.
4473686	4475747	Technically, that's kind of interesting.
4476747	4481568	Artistically, this feels completely soulless and dead.
4483140	4512481	that's how I felt about that performance because like what the fuck even was that Aloy you know in that video is like oh I'm doing okay I just have a little bit of a sore throat how was your day go what the fuck what I'm afraid I can't do that you have a sore throat what the fuck does that have to do with anything in Horizon sorry about your bad day girly but like I just it just doesn't
4514195	4523040	Yeah, E3VL's bringing up Seaman, Seaman, excuse me, Seaman, or Seaman, from the Dreamcast era and how weird that was, too.
4523060	4536768	Well, there's quite a bit more, you know, just going back to the negotiations, is they're really trying to get the verbiage nailed down.
4536788	4537849	Yeah.
4539387	4543028	Some of that verbiage in and of itself is problematic and leading to those loopholes.
4543048	4544669	I put a chart in chat.
4546449	4547490	You'll have to find it.
4547570	4552111	It's the comparison chart for SAG-AFTRA.
4552151	4553452	It's on SAG-AFTRA.org.
4555112	4562695	It's what the translation of the contractual text says in real words and then where they are on their gap.
4564756	4568517	It's a pretty interesting read, but I'll leave it there.
4570614	4577540	There's also more AI crap happening.
4580182	4596554	This was another article I was reading just earlier today where Sam Altman was deepfaked for an interview for a documentary that he had not agreed to be interviewed for.
4597574	4600256	which should absolutely be pursuable in court.
4601317	4600256	100%.
4602478	4603539	Oh, absolutely.
4604180	4613227	And I mean, the documentary is about him, but then he ended up making a film called Deep Faking Sam Altman.
4613948	4614268	Wow.
4617311	4617491	So...
4619476	4624259	Yeah, it just goes back to my biggest issue with AI is that AI is a tool.
4624479	4626001	AI is not a replacement for art.
4626441	4631344	And everything about that video, like where it was a tool, I guess it was okay.
4631445	4634727	Like it didn't seem to blow my mind any more than what's already out there on the PS5.
4635127	4638490	But as an art, like again, the voice, soulless.
4638670	4643534	It was like talking to – do you remember when Gigi Goode – I'm going to make everything a Drag Race analogy.
4643554	4647677	Do you remember when Gigi Goode on Drag Race Season 12 did Maria the Robot for Snatch Game?
4648437	4649278	Yes, that was great.
4649298	4649738	It's that.
4649818	4650398	That is it.
4650638	4655982	That is what you are talking to in that game is Maria the Robot, which is a real thing.
4656082	4658243	I actually saw at a conference for work once.
4658663	4659504	She's not named Maria.
4659544	4661545	It's something else, but it's patented.
4661565	4663526	So anyway, a whole other thing.
4663886	4666288	But it's very that.
4666408	4668889	And it's just, again, completely soulless.
4669249	4675033	If they want to use AI to design how the monsters move, design the map,
4675853	4683577	Design, well, even to some extent, that can get weird, but design how to hide things or design how the enemy controls some of that.
4683937	4688779	That's one thing, but to use it as an actual replacement for the art, I just think that's going to end.
4688839	4694882	Let me ask you this question, everybody, and especially the folks, because I know we had some AI enthusiasts in chat last week, which is fine.
4694922	4697343	I'm all for healthy dialogue, and I want to be...
4698203	4707209	I want to be open to some of the things that AI can do, but I just think there's obviously too much that people are trying to shove it into things they shouldn't do.
4707849	4708910	But let me ask you this.
4709810	4716554	Would you go watch a movie completely scripted and animated by AI?
4717315	4721237	Would you rather see that movie or would you rather see Pixar's next movie?
4722738	4723639	I have that through.
4725930	4726551	One of those companies.
4726571	4730460	If it was free, I would actually see the AI movie just to raz it.
4730740	4732003	They have one.
4732063	4732704	They have one.
4732865	4734629	It's through like...
4736767	4739549	They had one, it was like a love story or something like that.
4739629	4742051	It was absolutely looked like dog shit.
4742091	4747375	Well, I remember that whole Seinfeld thing on Twitch that got banned.
4747455	4748395	That's funny.
4749076	4755140	That was funny in the sense that it looks horrible and it was just people were watching because they knew it was horrible.
4755460	4758182	They weren't watching like, oh, this is new Seinfeld episodes.
4758202	4759143	They weren't looking at it like that.
4759163	4766028	They were just looking at the meme-ability of the insane things that the AI would say because it goes off the rails so quickly.
4766448	4768129	Assistive AI versus generative AI.
4782922	4786325	100%.
4783082	4786325	100%.
4783382	4786325	That is a very good way of putting it.
4786405	4788828	I'm pro-assistive AI.
4788908	4795235	I don't know if I'm going to say I'm anti-generative AI because I think there's some situations when it's more like the Google 2.0 type of thing.
4795595	4797858	I'm okay with it, but it's not a replacement.
4797938	4799680	It's never a replacement for art.
4801141	4802181	So did you see this?
4802261	4803662	I don't know if you've seen this or not.
4803682	4807063	This was on the TCL channel, which I did.
4807263	4809783	That's like the garbage TV stuff that comes in.
4810964	4815645	But this is an example of an actual AI movie that is entirely AI.
4816445	4817545	Yeah, it looks like it.
4817565	4818486	What the hell is this shit?
4818806	4819946	I don't even want to look at it.
4820506	4821607	Can I stop Paris?
4821827	4823207	Maybe after the show.
4823307	4823707	I don't know.
4823847	4824867	It looks bad.
4825087	4826748	Oh my god, you can...
4827466	4839217	Most of that AI dialogue always strikes me as, of course, we all remember the greatest cartoon ever made, which was rejected by Don Hertzfeld, a staple of Spike and Mike's Twisted and Sick Festival of Animation.
4840558	4842900	Okay, so you all remember that sequence.
4842960	4846344	Okay, then you know the sequence that goes, Tuesday's coming.
4846424	4847425	Did you bring your coat?
4848145	4849086	I am a banana.
4849446	4850647	My spoon is too big.
4850888	4853030	That's what fucking AI dialogue sounds like to me.
4854918	4857199	That's literally what those movies sound like to me.
4857239	4857659	But anyway.
4858499	4858779	All right.
4859740	4860340	Enough of that.
4861881	4864882	I will say, though, one last thing.
4865202	4873465	This is my extreme caution to the game industry on this.
4874841	4875822	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4895475	4907182	If you allow the voice of Aloy to be completely AI generated, I'm going to tell you what a lot of very disturbed people and gamers on X are going to do.
4908403	4914187	Aloy, would you pretty please say a slur just for me, just between friends?
4914807	4919490	Would you tell a naughty joke that you shouldn't say in public just between friends?
4921411	4928920	People are going to try their damnedest to get Aloy to say very bad things.
4928980	4931403	And you all know exactly what the fuck I'm talking about.
4931423	4932404	I don't need to elaborate.
4932424	4935028	I don't even think they need to try that hard to do that.
4935628	4936890	That's going to be a big problem.
4937728	4965921	have you heard the latest argument now that they're trying to make in court these AI companies are trying to convince the court that copyrighted material should be it should be fair use for them to train their AI algorithms on it oh well then if that's the case copyrighted material should be free for me to perform at any time exactly like if that gets passed through that oh yeah it's okay to train your stuff on this okay well then it's free game for everything right
4967292	4983568	or is it just that billion dollar companies, after they've already and mind you, they aren't asking permission up front, they've already done this, this is a thing they've already done, this is their defense in court saying that, oh we shouldn't be punished for stealing all this stuff, mind you that
4984269	4984449	What?
4984730	4991459	How many thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars were they suing people for downloading a song off Napster or something like that?
4991519	4997488	But yeah, oh hey, I can steal the entire works of every single artist out there and it's fine.
5000999	5004700	TigerClaw, you have some gold star comments once in a while, I'm really going to say.
5004780	5008260	TigerClaw says, so someone could have her say the C word?
5009481	5010301	Yes, they could.
5010761	5015342	Hey, Aloy, I really enjoy that song that Malta put in Eurovision.
5015382	5016682	Would you sing the lyrics with me?
5018322	5018682	I can't.
5018802	5019542	Malta's a cunt.
5022523	5023683	No, she's not.
5023723	5025224	I've never met the woman.
5025264	5027664	I'm just... I'm just talking about singing.
5029011	5036523	Anyway, Fit Dream says, I think they'd pre-record and release only curated things, not just give Aloy to the general public.
5037585	5043194	If having a sore throat was a curated statement, I question who's writing those curated statements.
5044321	5045422	Yes.
5046442	5050504	I too hope they do not replace the scripting and the voicing with AI.
5050744	5051885	I too am there.
5052505	5060248	If they want to use AI to jumpstart what that might look like, but don't replace the people that make it fluid.
5060488	5061789	That's, anyway.
5063190	5065991	I just, I can't with human people.
5066031	5066511	You can't?
5069533	5071634	People are not serving Kant right now.
5071714	5072214	They are not.
5072992	5075135	No, they're serving extra, which is the problem.
5075935	5078458	All right.
5078719	5086688	Let's move on to another story about a series that will finally be serving us something after like 13 years, right, Loki?
5089071	5093094	It's been a long time.
5093214	5105443	I mean, I don't know, what was the last remake of Elder Scrolls, a remaster or whatever that came out not that long ago?
5105963	5114389	Anyways, so it's been rumored for a while that Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion is going to be remade here pretty soon, and...
5115610	5143678	apparently it has been confirmed it is actually happening but there's now leaks saying that it's going to be announced very soon and that'll be coming out in June as well also along with the the leaks from I guess an insider NateTheHate also that they're going to be working on overhauling some of the systems in Oblivion as well including like the stamina system react
5144538	5151401	and the melee and archery combat to make it a little bit more improved and less irritating.
5152482	5153962	So cool.
5153982	5154843	I hope that happens.
5155643	5165027	Maybe we'll get this all, you know, I could see this as one of those things and it's out now type thing that after their Microsoft's
5166516	5169579	Live show or semi-live show or whatever the case may be.
5170780	5173823	It seems like one of those now type announcements.
5173984	5176086	I really hope this is the thing sooner rather than later, too.
5177187	5178789	This this would be great.
5179449	5183613	I would love to play a reworked Oblivion that kind of brings some of the modern stuff into it.
5183674	5185756	You know, just a little bit of quality of life juggling.
5186076	5187017	I think that'd be a great thing.
5187517	5188859	So I do hope it's true.
5188999	5189760	Yeah, for sure.
5191189	5195474	Plus, if Patrick Stewart is still the voice of, what was his name, Uriel?
5195975	5196836	That guy in the very beginning?
5197777	5198338	I'd be into that.
5198939	5199359	So, yeah.
5200200	5200481	All right.
5201909	5207454	Well, moving on, I'm sorry, but we have yet another AI story, but this is where the gaming world is right now.
5207875	5210578	This one's interesting.
5210758	5213120	I don't hate this one, and I'm going to explain why.
5213300	5218065	I really don't, because I don't think people are going to use it the way they think, and I'll explain why.
5219306	5221728	Microsoft is making a co-pilot...
5222449	5224091	Assistant for Games.
5225091	5227734	And it's, of course, going to use AI because that's what Copilot does.
5228254	5237302	And there are some conceptual videos with little, that means artistically rendered pop-ups that come up, but not something that is actually running in real time.
5237342	5244228	But things like, let's imagine that you're playing Minecraft and you were to ask Copilot, okay, I've got some wood.
5244509	5245530	What do I do with that?
5247202	5253548	and CoPilot answers, stroke the wood slowly back and forth because AI doesn't understand nuance.
5254168	5262596	No, but in this artistic render, it says, craft the oak logs into wooden planks by opening your inventory and placing the logs in the crafting area.
5262676	5266199	So it's basically game tips as you play the game.
5267560	5271083	God forbid Mojang is going to put a tutorial in their games.
5271203	5275666	Let's add all these new game mechanics and not explain any of it to anybody.
5275686	5278408	That's what the internet is for.
5278588	5285592	Another example in the video showed Copilot recommending a hero in Overwatch 2 to compliment the other folks on the team.
5287093	5289955	Answering questions about Minecraft and all this other stuff.
5290636	5296480	Copilot will be able to see your game screen via an app integration to offer the guidance in games real time.
5297140	5297761	Here's the thing.
5298221	5303445	Again, I don't necessarily hate this because I feel like so many people do this anyway.
5303925	5304446	I do this.
5304846	5308689	The only thing I do differently than the AI is just I have a Google window up.
5309289	5313192	How do I find the XYZ item in Final Fantasy XIV?
5313573	5316174	What are the farming locations for this?
5316295	5318957	Everything I'm doing here is just Googling it.
5319557	5324181	So if this co-pilot is just now I'm Googling it with my voice and it shows up on screen with the game...
5325191	5328593	Okay, is it going to get it right 100% of the time?
5328793	5330634	I guarantee you it's not.
5331334	5334035	So my question is, are people actually going to use this?
5334996	5336797	Because did you all forget?
5337837	5343720	Or as Kathy Bates once famously said in the movie Misery, have you all got amnesia?
5344301	5346562	He didn't get out of the cock-a-doodie car!
5349525	5355048	The PlayStation 5 touted something very similar to this when it came out.
5355688	5361232	It wasn't AI, but it was little short videos showing you how to unlock trophies.
5361892	5362993	Pop quiz, folks.
5363573	5367935	When was the last time any of you PlayStation 5 owners used that feature?
5369056	5372238	When was the last time you saw a game that had that supported in it?
5373399	5373719	I'll wait.
5376766	5378568	I haven't played a PS5.
5378788	5380270	I don't have a PS5.
5390933	5392694	People are probably just not going to use it.
5392834	5394954	You have to give people incentive to use this.
5395355	5399936	And one of the top incentives would be to make sure it's always giving accurate information.
5400276	5405118	But you know, this is where the gaming industry is its own worst enemy.
5405458	5407379	You can't see me, but I'm tapping the desk.
5407439	5408980	I'm hoping the sound comes through.
5409480	5414702	This is where the game industry is its own worst enemy because games are constantly being patched.
5415282	5420504	upgraded, changed, microtransacted, morphed, and all of that.
5420845	5425607	So a lot of times when you want to Google the answer to a question, how do I find XYZ?
5425967	5429148	The answer you get was true three patches ago.
5431629	5437112	And what do you bet this thing runs into the same problem, rendering it useless?
5439588	5442290	Alright, Mish says, I use it all the time.
5442390	5445332	Currently using it on Stellar Blade and Horizon Forbidden West.
5445472	5446833	Alright, shut me up.
5447053	5451657	But I just feel like it's a totally underused type of feature, type of thing.
5452237	5456680	So, Fifth Dream says, I never used it because I'm good at games.
5458982	5459643	Okay, that's funny.
5459683	5460463	That's a good troll.
5460483	5461224	That's a good troll answer.
5461664	5461964	Good job.
5462925	5465827	Fifth Dream says, they call that backseating on Twitch.
5465907	5467148	Most people ban for it.
5467668	5468329	Yeah, so I'm
5469656	5472239	Look, and Deft actually sees benefit.
5472439	5478044	Deft goes, I need that co-pilot stuff on Overwatch now so my teammates don't fuck up.
5478605	5482229	Again, this is assistive AI versus generative AI.
5482769	5486173	My only concern with this is, is it really going to assist people?
5488339	5490482	But conceptually, I don't hate it.
5491224	5495150	I don't think it's any... I think people use deadly boss mods.
5495370	5497373	Yeah, and people Google shit all the time.
5497473	5500618	So fine, put that on the screen, but just don't expect it to be right.
5503222	5503503	All right.
5504938	5509360	Unless maybe it trains off of documentations the developers provided if they want to.
5509480	5511601	Then maybe that could get interesting.
5511681	5512061	We'll see.
5513482	5515423	ChatGTP fueled game facts.
5516283	5520165	So I realize this might surprise you as much as we've talked about AI on this show.
5520185	5524467	But I will say this co-pilot AI thing, I don't hate it.
5524927	5526468	I'm skeptical if it's really going to work.
5526968	5527329	That's all.
5528329	5529910	But maybe in five years it's a little different.
5531027	5531928	All right.
5532008	5537872	SheHulk wants to point out, Xbox already has true achievements integrated to help with achievements, and it works great.
5538692	5550160	QuestBuster says, I've used YouTube build guides for Diablo 4 and The First Descendant because I don't have weeks to figure out the math behind what does what after wondering what my tune hits like a wet noodle and where I went wrong.
5550520	5555423	I'm going to give these guys a free plug, but this is the personal site I use for Diablo 4.
5555463	5556404	It's called MaxRoll.
5556824	5557865	MaxRoll.gg.
5558445	5559826	Icy Veins is another good backup.
5559846	5560026	MaxRoll.gg.
5560106	5566807	The reason why I'm telling you that versus YouTube is that Max Roll automatically updates with every single season and every single patch.
5567147	5568948	There are little nerds and a complimentary.
5569268	5572668	There are nerds that crunch all the numbers, do that with every season.
5572728	5574009	And so they build all the builds.
5574049	5575249	That's what I use for Diablo 4.
5576809	5578309	YouTube has that.
5578709	5581150	It's outdated by the time the next patch comes out problem.
5581510	5584190	Unless maybe you're checking your created by dates.
5584230	5586971	Like if your created date was within the last couple of weeks, that's probably okay.
5587071	5587411	That's fine.
5589138	5594360	Alright, anyway, let's move on to something we're going to see a lot of YouTube tours on in the not-too-distant future.
5594540	5595141	DarkSakura?
5597442	5607066	Oh, I think it's going to be time for a field trip soon because the Nintendo store in San Francisco is opening on...
5608081	5608441	Already.
5610322	5611343	It opened yesterday.
5612684	5623971	We have a Nintendo store open in San Francisco and it is located at 331 Powell Street at the corner of Powell and Geary in Union Square.
5624911	5625652	We know where that is.
5627093	5629314	And it's the second retail location in the U.S.
5629354	5630415	Not off the top of my brain.
5630455	5632136	You said it's 331 Powell Street?
5633416	5635017	Corner of Powell and Geary.
5635358	5635618	Okay.
5637219	5637439	So...
5639167	5641269	Anyway, but it's 331 Powell Street.
5642550	5645672	But yeah, I think it's going to be time for a field trip soon.
5646853	5649956	Except, don't you have to get on a waiting list or something?
5650176	5651517	I thought I remember that's a thing.
5651837	5654960	I don't see anything about a waiting list.
5655601	5660605	I thought I saw something online about that they're going to have people sign up for a waiting list.
5660625	5662106	This isn't even a full article.
5662766	5663767	So, hold on.
5663887	5665469	I'm going to go to Nintendo's website.
5666750	5666850	Um...
5669534	5672357	Wow, no phone number listed, nothing.
5672577	5673138	That's fine.
5673198	5679305	And I'm doing a little magic travel here to see where this is, to see if it jogs my memory.
5679405	5681047	Oh, it is right there in Union Square.
5681067	5682288	So it must be this space here.
5682748	5684010	Your brand here, retail.
5684290	5687954	Can you imagine all these people that are going to soon live on top of the Nintendo store?
5688375	5689035	Can you imagine?
5689676	5690496	is going to be wild.
5690796	5695138	But yeah, Palangiri, unless it's on this side, it could be on this side of it.
5695618	5697819	No, but I think this is 331 right here.
5699160	5701721	It is literally right across from Union Square.
5701841	5706903	This big building in the back, that's the huge Macy's building, I'm pretty sure, with the Cheesecake Factory on the roof.
5707503	5710084	Oh, look, there's a Nintendo bus going by.
5710264	5711845	No, that's Saks.
5711885	5713766	Oh, this is the Macy's.
5714106	5716207	Oh, shit, it's across the street from that Macy's.
5718345	5722469	We have videos from NBC Bay Area.
5722849	5723210	Oh, shoot.
5723590	5723830	Okay.
5726193	5726853	I'll fill you in.
5727474	5733000	But anyway, all I really need to know is it's literally across the street from Union Square Macy's.
5733320	5737004	Fun fact, Alan and I had our first date in Union Square many, many years ago.
5737244	5738826	There you go.
5739307	5740488	But I'm trying to remember, what was that?
5741926	5744228	What was that building before?
5744768	5745609	Oh, well, I don't remember.
5746309	5747970	But yeah, that's right in the heart of everything.
5748210	5750372	Yeah, I'm all for a field trip if we can go.
5750432	5756476	Hopefully, you know, I'm sure this place is going to get slammed in the first month, but then hopefully it kind of chills out after some time.
5756496	5764922	So by the time summer rolls around, Memorial Day, that whole type of thing, hopefully it's, well, maybe not as soon as Memorial Day, but hopefully by the time summer rolls around, like my birthday, SF Pride.
5765623	5766724	Although I don't like SF Pride.
5767024	5768505	Rob, it is the, your...
5770367	5771711	Your brand here place.
5771871	5772313	Okay, it is.
5772393	5772674	Okay.
5773516	5773797	Yeah.
5774680	5776264	Still, it looks like a nice building.
5776786	5776906	So...
5778382	5781845	That's the Macy's that gives out all the Armani makeup samples just like if you ask for it.
5801112	5801632	Oh, that's nice.
5802273	5803193	Yeah.
5803393	5806555	I've bought many a wardrobe at that Macy's actually.
5807235	5813719	Because it's so big, they have large amounts of the collections of all the strange brands that you can get.
5813779	5816641	Like International Concepts, which is a Macy's brand I love.
5816681	5819202	I get a lot of my eccentric hosting outfits through that.
5820343	5822264	They have a ton of it at the San Francisco one.
5822404	5823464	So that's why I like to go there.
5825045	5825245	All right.
5825265	5827246	Anyway, let's move on.
5827266	5828107	We'll go back over to Loki.
5829488	5834129	Alright, so BlizzCon is not coming back this year.
5834489	5839731	They are skipping 2025, but they're going to return next year.
5840531	5845433	Apparently they don't have a lot to announce or something, at least in the physical form, I don't know.
5847776	5868353	but yeah it says uh apparently they confirmed that the they're going to be returning on September 12th and was it they're doing the um events gonna be I guess returning in 2026 on the September 12th and ending on September 13th and they're not selling tickets yet for it um
5870475	5874197	I guess they said when BlizzCon returns in 2020... Oh, here we go.
5874237	5875117	Here's the full statement.
5875297	5885142	Yeah, it says BlizzCon is back and... Nothing really... No real details on what's going to change just other than they're going to be delaying it a year, I guess.
5888334	5895437	Um, you know, it, it, well, I think you're going along the right line of thinking is that they probably just don't have a lot to announce this year.
5895557	5898638	I mean, we know there's probably going to be a new World of Warcraft expansion.
5898678	5902540	Well, we know there is one coming because remember they announced three in a row, right?
5902580	5906402	They announced War Within, Midnight, uh, what was the other one?
5906842	5908503	I can't even remember now, but there was a third expansion.
5908543	5908943	Sorry, folks.
5908963	5909383	I don't remember.
5909963	5913585	Um, so we know that that's because this is going to be the one that has player housing and all that stuff.
5914165	5914526	and DarkSakura.
5933766	5962077	I think they know better than to throw a BlizzCon for a mobile phone game I think they learned that lesson so I don't think it'll be that maybe something in the StarCraft universe ooh, didn't we have the rumors about not StarCraft Ghost but basically StarCraft Ghost kind of making a comeback, that concept of StarCraft coming back as a shooter I wonder I wonder maybe that's the thing that they're finally going to be ready to show in 2026 that they're ramping up to
5963260	5984854	so we'll see E3VL says Overwatch roadmap you know we might have a major Overwatch revision dare I say Overwatch 3 but I feel like Blizzard's kind of had their statement on why maybe how about this I'm not even going to say Overwatch 3 I'm going to say finally some Overwatch PVE finally some Overwatch PVE maybe like a spinoff thing I don't know I don't know
5986926	6008636	maybe I'm getting a little wacky wild there but I'd be curious to see what they might have come but I don't think that I mean obviously they're not going to have anything Diablo outside of a new expansion they'll have their regular expansion to the card game Hearthstone we already know what's going on in Warcraft so I feel like it has to be something Starcraft or something completely new
6010632	6011052	So we'll see.
6011632	6013333	Yeah, I guess we'll wait and see.
6013653	6015453	Yeah, but not this year.
6015953	6033818	Okay, let's talk about, this is a very interesting phenomenon that a lot of people are talking about across a lot of gaming blogs and things like that this week, is that Super Nintendo consoles, and I mean the old school fucking brick consoles from 1991 that still fucking work because they used to make consoles really well back then.
6034599	6038660	It might be a really disgusting color, but those things do work, right?
6039020	6039160	But
6039500	6042382	There's some interesting things going on with the Super Nintendo hardware.
6042482	6048687	Apparently, the console is actually getting faster as it gets older.
6049527	6051249	It's ever so slight.
6051949	6058234	But apparently, there is what's called the SMP speed ROM test that you can run with a flash cart.
6058734	6067561	And through 143 users participating in a TASBOT survey over on BlueSky at TAS.BOT.com,
6068161	6071944	was running this test over on Blue Sky, said, can people run this?
6071984	6076287	And based on the results, Super Nintendo has confirmed it is running faster.
6076928	6080710	The audio processing unit, or the APU, runs faster.
6081431	6084513	Apparently, the DSP rate averages 32,076 hertz, rising 8 hertz from cold to warm.
6090017	6091599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6113760	6128027	but if you are talking a frame by frame speedrun assisted bot doing this instead, I could see where every frame really can matter and make or break these speedruns.
6128648	6133550	So this is probably very fascinating as far as being able to run these things on original hardware.
6133570	6135571	Are they better with age, like a fine wine?
6136272	6136572	I mean...
6138157	6139018	It depends on how you look at it.
6139038	6140158	It's just the hardware is breaking down.
6140178	6142040	It's just breaking down in a way that benefits.
6142140	6143621	Yeah, it's breaking down in a weird way.
6143741	6144422	Speeding up.
6144562	6144962	Exactly.
6144982	6150346	But it doesn't mean it's like, it's not how it's supposed to operate.
6150426	6156910	As a joke, I'm out with another joke saying, so what you're saying is Super Nintendo finally got its blast processing update after 35 years.
6157111	6157331	Yes.
6157811	6158532	For fuck's sake.
6159032	6159332	Yes.
6160833	6161214	All right.
6162494	6164536	Enough of you clowns in chat.
6164596	6165276	Let's move on.
6165597	6166998	No, actually, it's specifically Matt.
6167038	6167338	Specifically.
6169517	6171020	And when I say clown, I mean Matt.
6171541	6173445	All right, anyway, moving on.
6174627	6179537	Let's do the classic game of the week, whether it's sped up or not.
6190245	6197532	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
6197993	6200535	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6201876	6204179	And what did you pick for the game this week, DarkSakura?
6204199	6206081	It's a little bit of a deep cut.
6207725	6208345	Is it really?
6208585	6209165	I think so.
6209265	6209605	I don't know.
6209806	6212106	People know that I'm a fan of the series.
6212286	6213086	True.
6213506	6213746	True.
6213926	6224069	Yeah, but the game that I picked is Keio Yuugekitai Katsugekihen, which is the sequel to the last Keio Flying Squadron.
6225569	6230170	So anyway, this came out on the Saturn in 1996.
6230971	6233791	There also was a European release.
6233891	6235492	We did not get this in the US.
6237512	6240835	And I mean, it's okay.
6240895	6241936	I mean, it's a cute game.
6241976	6242837	It's really funny.
6243017	6246100	It's very, very Japanese culture heavy.
6247782	6248963	But we'll get back into that.
6249083	6255489	So the original Keio Yugekitai, or Keio Flying Squadron, was a shimupi.
6255609	6256790	This one is a platformer.
6257991	6277357	and um it also of course like the last game it it has a very big Japanese culture influence but also ancient and modern at the same time it's an interesting little universe that these characters live in so at any rate um a year after Keio Yu Gekitai
6279158	6291889	There were some major economic consequences, and so there were public works set in place for the new Edo Castle, because they live in Edo, which was the original name for Tokyo as the Japanese capital.
6291989	6293771	How's that?
6294171	6307042	Dr. Pon Eho is a tanuki with a genius IQ of 1400, but he had to labor, and he found some scrolls that show where to find six magical orbs or jewels in the Japanese version.
6307722	6326361	and so he'd gather the orbs to get, you know, treasure so he left and went to search for the orbs and then the main character for KO Flying Squadron is Rami Nanahikari
6327291	6349136	and their family is having dinner and then the 13th queen of Yamatai Koku named Himiko Yamatai which is another historical name for this famed ancient princess Yamatai was the name that was given to Japan I think by China
6350276	6351277	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6369938	6377446	Rami is actually the grandchild of an ancient family and descendant of aliens that came to Earth.
6377867	6382111	And so she wears her bunny suit, which is the formal attire of a key guardian.
6382712	6384634	And that explains the outfit.
6385935	6390440	Anyway, so like I said, for those in chat...
6391949	6417189	anyone who's watching the video it it's a platformer and you go around and you fight a bunch of like tanuki and other creatures and uh rob if you skip up to uh the second time stamp uh one of the boss battles sorry i have to look up what it was again hold on uh 1441 i remember it because the number oh damn go you okay thank you
6417847	6443728	yeah but anyway um you have these cut scenes in it and like so she's coming up in the middle of a like a sumo competition and and they're like no you can't go and she's like watch me and so she has to fight a uh a sumo who gets like encased in a um uh I can see the name in my head Daruma
6445143	6448470	and she has to fight the giant Daruma.
6448550	6450033	It's absolutely silly.
6450333	6452537	I mean, this game is hilarious.
6455323	6455483	And
6457585	6459627	By the way, I've seen copies of this game.
6459647	6460648	The cheapest I saw was like $150.
6462049	6465212	So not like super, super high crazy, but still high crazy.
6466353	6473619	So anyway, Rami can also get different weapons.
6474239	6478923	And there are still like a couple of shmup levels.
6479884	6486309	But there are other things that she can get called the Homing Spot Junior.
6486909	6488770	You can get those only as bonuses.
6490371	6496556	So as far as the other stages, there's a vertically scrolling bonus stage, a roller coaster stage, an underwater stage.
6497096	6499177	So it's pretty much a multi-genre platformer.
6499978	6503480	Some of the bonuses that you can collect are three weapons.
6503520	6506742	So there's Atami, the Hammer of Dreams, which is a large mallet.
6508123	6517847	Kinugawa, which is the Umbrella of Hope, an umbrella that you can hit enemies with or float or deflect overhead obstacles.
6518568	6523590	And Kunsatsu, the Arrow of Hope, which is a bow and arrow, and you can just shoot people.
6524190	6530032	You can bounce on the heads of enemies, and then you can use kappa to reach higher places.
6530052	6532573	The kappa are, well, turtle demons.
6533934	6534014	Um...
6535467	6544230	If you are hit while you're not holding something, you lose life, but your weapons are kind of used as armor.
6545170	6552193	And you get points orbs to collect, and you'll get different rewards for them.
6554293	6555614	But that's the game.
6556434	6559535	If you want to play it, good luck.
6560794	6563696	But this was, I mean, after K.O.U.
6563716	6570320	Gekitai was very well received, the developers at Victor Entertainment wanted to make a sequel.
6571541	6575783	And they were trying to get ideas together.
6576184	6579646	And here's the thing, they were looking at the three sequels.
6580626	6591152	making a 3D video game, but they chose to stick to 2D because the game was started development for Sega CD, which Keio Gekitai was on.
6593733	6603318	But once the Saturn release was rumored amongst the developers, they changed and really tried to
6605214	6615741	pushed the 2D capabilities so they stuck with 2D and they were going to make it a graphically enhanced version of K.O.U.
6615761	6626729	Gekitai but then it was made into its own game with a different story they wanted it to be a little bit different so they wanted to bring out more of the charm of the characters and so that's why they did it this way
6630311	6638635	There also... There was a... One of the shooter stages was going to be a platformer stage.
6638695	6640015	It's the Sumida River.
6641096	6641176	Um...
6642722	6664199	and so there are bow and arrow sets in there that you can't obtain and so there's like there's just like little pieces left in the game like in the code or you can see them on screen from their original what's the word I'm thinking of the original concepts so
6667010	6677138	There was, like, even going to be the martial arts tournament was planned to have seven participants in it, but they ended up scrapping five of them and only left in two.
6677258	6679500	So there's, like, all kinds of stuff.
6679540	6684344	And they wanted the soundtrack to have a relaxed tone, just kind of easygoing.
6686505	6687606	But, yeah.
6688387	6688867	It was...
6690288	6693972	It was released May 17th, 1996 for the Saturn.
6694132	6697515	And then in Europe and Australia, it was September later on.
6697975	6702440	It was supposed to be out March that year and had been considered for a North American release.
6705763	6713770	And then there was this release that came out in Japan as a Sega Saturn disc called Keio Yu Gekitai Okeraku...
6716041	6718082	I'm sorry, I have my screen set for really small.
6718563	6724026	Tama Tobacco, which was the KO Flying Squadron carefree jewel box that was not for resale.
6724966	6731951	And it had really high quality versions of the opening and ending FMV cutscenes of the games, which are
6733031	6759183	fully animated scenes and then there were some other scenes that were related to the second game and demo levels from the second game and a sound test with voice clips and everything and there's all kinds of neat stuff on there it was pretty cool it got mixed reception everyone thought that the game looked really great and they loved the soundtrack but they thought that the controls were not as great
6760283	6784411	um and of course there was uh the whole rivalry rivalry with Nintendo and PlayStation at the time that was taking away some of the market share for platformers um but there were folks who just said it seemed generic and way too easy but it was still pretty fun because it was odd and there you go all right
6785728	6788270	Yeah, not a game I knew a lot about, to be honest.
6788310	6795955	I know you're a fan of this series, but you know I missed most of the Saturn games, and so I'm kind of learning about them years later, to be quite honest, through segments such as this one.
6795975	6800258	Well, this is one a lot of people just really aren't super aware of, I mean.
6801419	6808284	But this is another one of those games that follows, like Terranigma did, where it came out.
6809179	6811820	in Japan and Europe, but never in North America.
6811900	6812900	Well, Australia as well.
6812960	6814701	But I don't know that Terranigma came out in Australia.
6814941	6815561	I have to look it up.
6815781	6820103	But yeah, it looks like it just has some neat things for its time in platforming.
6820143	6828645	And yeah, definitely like that sense of humor as well that, you know, maybe you would see in like, I don't know, Goemon, but not a lot, a lot outside of that.
6828725	6829306	So yeah.
6829326	6830366	And it's still different.
6830386	6832387	I think the pace is a little bit slow on it to me.
6832627	6832847	Yeah.
6833487	6833667	So.
6834247	6834567	But neat.
6834928	6835248	I mean.
6836228	6836348	Yeah.
6837222	6856486	I love all the imagery in it and I love the graphics so it's really pretty great choice for a classic game awesome awesome alright we're gonna get back into some more news here in fact we're gonna get into some rapid fire news here on the program let's get to it Loki what do you have for us quickly
6857521	6858482	Oh, I'm so excited.
6858682	6861404	They've announced the sequel to PowerWash Sim.
6861624	6863125	So it's PowerWash Simulator 2.
6863165	6866788	It's going to be coming out later this year, console and PC.
6867708	6868889	It needs a tagline.
6869169	6872292	It needs that wash harder or something.
6873813	6875874	Electric Boogaloo or something like that.
6875954	6876315	I don't know.
6876755	6877295	It needs a title.
6878755	6883578	They said they're going to have two players split screen in there as well.
6885259	6887241	Other than that, it looks pretty similar.
6888181	6894625	There's supposed to be a hub that you can set up and customize.
6896747	6899288	Maybe like your own company office or something like that.
6899649	6900249	You can do that.
6902731	6904732	But yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
6904832	6906253	I love PowerWash Simulator.
6906293	6906633	It's a...
6909323	6932188	just one of those simple fun games that you just I know exactly what you mean it's a great game to just get high to and play I mean to just zone out and play yeah so I highly recommend it and I'm definitely looking forward to checking it out when it comes out later this year and then along with that um
6933817	6944741	There's a brand new LEGO Mario set, and it is a LEGO Mario Kart set that features Mario in his iconic go-kart for $170.
6945021	6955645	It's coming out in May, I think May 1st, and that was announced on Mario Day, and of course...
6957501	6984805	it looks amazing like it's a really well put together set so I I don't want it it's eight and a half inches tall and like twelve and a half inches wide so it's not a small thing alright I'm excited for more Lego sets I'm not excited to spend the money on it but you know that's how those things go sometimes so alright DarkSakura what do you got for us?
6986497	6988839	Oh, I have some fun stuff.
6989139	6998027	So one of my favorite games ever, Chrono Trigger, is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and there are lots of projects going on.
7000649	7009596	There was a celebration post on their Twitter, I love that the site's still calling it Twitter, that Squenic says we can look forward to various developments that go beyond the world of the game.
7010497	7012439	It actually, I will...
7013199	7018701	a quote to mark the 30th anniversary and to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far.
7019081	7022923	We are planning a variety of projects over the next year that will go beyond the world of the game.
7023003	7024543	Please look forward to the latest information.
7025604	7028645	And then there is a, well, it's already happened.
7028665	7034447	There was a live stream of music from Chrono Trigger from the soundtrack on March 14th.
7034467	7035968	And there was another one.
7036088	7038869	Actually, it's still, it went until March 15th.
7040349	7041670	But the whole thing is up on YouTube.
7041710	7043791	I can copy the link for chat.
7045312	7050855	But yeah, it's... I have very special memories attached to this game.
7053617	7054197	Good times.
7054317	7057079	Maybe, maybe for its birthday, I'll play it again.
7058139	7058920	What do you think of that?
7059580	7059940	Maybe.
7060420	7060881	No promises.
7060901	7064383	I've gotten practically all the endings, so... But I told you what...
7066178	7068019	It's a very, very treasured memory.
7070381	7089511	One of the last Facebook messages, when I was still on Facebook, that I got from my papa-san, who passed away a couple years ago, was a message out of the blue that says, I remember how I loved sitting and watching you play Chrono Trigger.
7093293	7094954	And I've kept that message forever.
7095562	7096563	Oh, I love that.
7097664	7097944	Yeah.
7098905	7099225	All right.
7099826	7108533	Well, no easy way to follow that up, but I will talk about a game that I definitely am always willing to replay, and that's Katamari Damacy.
7109374	7109754	Good times.
7109794	7112617	You know, it's been a long time since we've had a new Katamari game.
7112997	7121585	It hasn't been that long since we've had a Katamari remaster, because we had one of those in 2023, but it's been a while since we've had a full-on new Katamari game.
7122045	7122826	Catamari Damashii Rolling Live
7137621	7143807	I have my own criticisms about playing games on touchscreens and things like that when a game is not specifically designed for that.
7143967	7148651	But I see Katamari as a game that actually makes a lot of sense for a phone.
7148751	7150113	So this could actually be pretty cool.
7150433	7152375	I'm really curious to check this out.
7152955	7157319	So it's not going to be something extremely different from other Katamari games.
7158362	7159263	You play as the prince.
7159683	7160704	You roll up objects.
7160884	7161505	They get big.
7161605	7162526	They become stars.
7162986	7166910	But this time, and I love this, it's Kaidabai Damasi rolling live.
7167310	7170453	You are now the prince as a live streamer.
7172421	7172961	I kind of love it.
7197120	7198081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7212990	7215552	could stand to be the best fucking part of this game right there.
7216312	7219194	It's the soundtrack, so there's a lot of good stuff in there.
7219234	7221296	I'm just, yeah, this is cool.
7221416	7222236	Please don't let me down.
7222256	7223017	Please don't let me down.
7223037	7225919	I'm so disappointed that it's only on one platform, though.
7226099	7227080	Like, I don't like that.
7227660	7232884	Regardless of what game it is, especially like a Katamari or something like that, like, I hate when they just...
7233584	7235506	Put out a game on one platform.
7235826	7241110	You know, maybe it'll go the way of Fantasian and in two years, you know, and to be fair, any game.
7241150	7244833	I say Fantasian because that was Apple Arcade specifically, but you could put any, insert any game here.
7244873	7245974	How about Final Fantasy 16?
7246314	7249597	You know, it goes, or Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now is going to be on the platform.
7249857	7250878	They all do eventually.
7251078	7252259	Well is a deep word.
7253135	7262001	Somebody here has an active Apple Arcade account and could very well be more than happy to demo the game for people.
7262021	7262582	There you go.
7263943	7265064	It's Streamception.
7265384	7266885	You're streaming a game about streaming.
7268546	7268987	Gasp.
7269287	7269607	Gasp.
7270287	7270968	What does it mean?
7271929	7287524	Another quick footnote on Apple Arcade because this was announced alongside another announcement about Skate City New York getting an upgrade with 30 new levels and 90 new objectives also coming March 27th and a new Space Invaders game coming on April 3rd.
7287985	7293230	When you put those next to Katamari Damacy, it's harder to care because Katamari Damacy is everything.
7293330	7293611	Exactly.
7293631	7293931	Exactly.
7294111	7294911	All right.
7295052	7297493	And that's why I gave them the footnote they deserved.
7297573	7298353	And we're going to move on.
7298393	7299273	All right, let's move on.
7299894	7305757	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some big games coming out soon, starting with the U.S.

7492662	7492962	I don't know.
7492982	7493503	Who cares?
7493523	7493863	Who cares?
7493883	7495364	I don't care.
7495785	7497586	Like, I didn't care until they had the guy.
7497666	7498787	Okay, fine.
7499288	7502891	It looks like one of them has like a triple gun and another one has like a rocket launcher.
7503251	7504993	The other one has purple hair on fire.
7505774	7508336	And yeah, these birds are up to no good.
7510478	7510878	Sounds good.

7556593	7557193	Well, guess what?
7557273	7558715	Assassin's Creed Shadows.
7559295	7562918	You thought Ubisoft's AAA games were a symptom of the US?
7563058	7564619	Nope, it's a worldwide problem.
7564659	7566140	So that game's coming out in Japan as well.
7566461	7568602	Actually, Assassin's Creed mainline games tend to be pretty good.
7568642	7571464	I'm just... Y'all know, Ubisoft just...
7572265	7573327	Irritating the shit out of us.
7574588	7578333	But Atlier, of course, is also releasing on the PlayStation 5, so please look forward to that.
7578474	7582659	And Bleach, Rebirth of Souls, also on the PlayStation 5 this week.

7596718	7601842	On the 18th, we have 33 Immortals Early Access PC Xboxes.

7625901	7628823	On the 21st, we have Broken Lore Don't Watch for PC.
7630044	7638447	Assault Suit Lanos 2 Saturn Tribute for Switch and PlayStation, Xenoblade Chronicles X Remastered for Switch.
7639227	7645870	For on the 21st, we have Atelier Yumiya, The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land for Switch.
7647030	7651552	And also on the 21st, Bleach, Rebirth of Souls, PlayStation, Xboxes, PC.
7654441	7660707	Alrighty, with that being our release dates, let's do, I think we have one more story for y'all tonight.
7660787	7662149	Let's go over to Loki.
7663271	7670217	Yeah, apparently Split Fiction is exceeding their expectations as far as what it's selling.
7670237	7685549	I think it's sold over 2 million copies so far, and is one of the top-selling, or is the top-selling game, at least currently right now, was on Steam, at least on March 7th.
7685630	7686911	It looks like it hit the top one.
7688012	7688172	Um...
7688985	7718492	and that's probably because it's not a $70 game and it doesn't have any microtransactions so they've said they're not gonna have microtransactions plus being that it is a co-op game like it takes two you can also play with your friends um while only one copy if you use the friend pass thing so oh shit that's pretty you can do the the co-op stuff so um i know it takes two was a great game won a bunch of awards and stuff so that was good i played it gonna go along the same lines yeah
7719554	7721315	Yeah, so not surprising.
7721935	7729778	But hey, once again, proving that it doesn't take large budgets to make a solid game that sells well.
7730018	7739582	And sometimes just make a good game is more important than make a game with flashy graphics and all these other buzzwords and stuff.
7739622	7742723	I mean, let's look at what Assassin's Creed is going to do.
7743083	7745204	I mean, sure, it's probably going to sell okay, but...
7747133	7772351	I think those games are kind of just trending downwards they're not getting better they're just kind of and make a complete experience that's very rewarding for 70 bucks Baldur's Gate 3 says hello like yeah I mean do you know I'm hearing uh this is EA's first game not that critics matter but we do talk about it sometimes EA's first game to Metacritic above 90 in like a decade
7774400	7775061	A very long time.
7775081	7777903	Maybe I might be overstating, but it's many years.
7778463	7786509	It's an indie game, and EA games, especially if you're talking about Madden and stuff, a lot of that stuff is just recycled year after year.
7786589	7788750	EA's still publishing it, for what it's worth.
7788850	7790011	It's still an EA game.
7790832	7795695	Maybe this is the type of thing that EA, you'll learn from this, EA.
7795755	7797397	Look at the success here, and look.
7799878	7800919	You can make a good game.
7801379	7802140	A complete game.
7802780	7803241	Out the box.
7804853	7809737	Anyway, we wouldn't have a complete show if we didn't invite the listeners to participate.
7809777	7817043	We love all you guys that show up here week after week to listen to our show and participate with us, whether you're here live with us on Sunday night or you participate on the podcast feed.
7817343	7819745	We do invite your emails so you can participate with us every week.
7819805	7823849	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we will read your emails.
7823909	7826231	DarkSakura, I think we have at least one tonight, right?
7826351	7826891	We have one.
7827152	7827532	All right.
7827932	7828533	Let's get into it.
7828993	7830534	I think I know who this is from based on Blue Sky.
7830554	7833197	Hiya, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Mike Deft.
7834117	7862543	as you may have talked about earlier in the show Niantic sold most of their games divisions to Scopely one of the biggest mobile gaming companies out there I personally am not thrilled about this purchase at all some people have said this is good that finally Niantic doesn't have a say in how the games are run and that finally someone that seems competent enough and knows how to develop actual games will fix all the problems and bugs in them I want to believe them and that's probably the case but who knows exactly because there's something that's certain and that is
7863363	7864284	Scopely wants money.
7865325	7870511	Scopely just didn't dish out over $3 billion just because they have cash burning on their bank account.
7870871	7877679	They obviously want the success Niantic has or had in raking in the money from all of these games, especially Pokemon Go.
7878159	7879801	And if Scopely is known for something...
7880982	7882923	is how they handle monetization in their games.
7883003	7885504	And that's what worries me the most of this whole deal.
7886065	7895970	I mean, I can be very optimistic about this and say that the game won't change that much, if at all, because, and thank you, whoever deity for this, the whole team from Niantic is going to still be working on the games.
7896830	7912776	they'll just have to answer to Scopely now maybe they'll add something like hey if you want to spend this Pokestop again sooner spend coins or like they already do with Dynamax and Gigantamax raids pay to add more bonus reward items I seriously hope
7913916	7919101	I seriously hope that is the future of the game with Scopely and I'll totally be fine with it.
7919941	7926106	They'll for sure get rid of remote raid limits and possibly add most stuff to help with the game but for a price.
7926827	7931150	We're going to see changes for sure but I don't think it will be entirely for the best.
7931210	7935174	Again, Scopely wants all the money and if you think Niantic was greedy, we haven't seen the worst yet.
7935774	7938956	The worst case scenario is that we're going to have to pay for literally everything.
7939556	7941517	Oh, you hit your spin limit for the day, you gotta pay up.
7942197	7945358	Or, hey, wanna participate in this event at all?
7945439	7945979	Pay up.
7946519	7950401	It's not gonna be great and we're all gonna suffer for it and make the game not enjoyable at all.
7950461	7952362	And that's what worries me the most about this game.
7952462	7953242	It finally dies.
7953822	7956744	I've been playing Pogo since day one or zero even.
7956804	7958865	I installed the APK from the New Zealand release.
7959565	7966751	and while not a perfect run, I enjoyed the ride so far and that's because the people I've met, the experiences I've had and all I've done in these almost eight years.
7968219	7974541	Those ain't gonna go away and I'll cherish them but I can't help but feel it all going down the drain because of corporate greed.
7975062	7980183	I'm still playing Pokemon Go daily and will continue to do so until it's not fun or enjoyable at all.
7980663	7987826	In the end, my love for Pokemon is greater than my love for Go and nobody will probably ever take that.
7988646	7993248	I seriously, seriously hope I'm wrong about this and I'm just worrying too much about
7994108	7996052	I'm worrying too much and everything will be fine and dandy.
7996412	7996993	But no one knows.
7997314	8000019	We'll just have to wait and see and hope for the best.
8000379	8004266	I'll just end this email with the old saying, better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
8004446	8006250	Thanks for reading and wish you all the best.
8008288	8009249	Thank you for the email, Deft.
8009729	8016615	I'm not sure I have anything really to add to it since we, you know, spent, I spent a good 30 minutes at the top of the show talking about it, so I don't want to totally repeat everything.
8016695	8018177	I appreciate the additional perspective.
8018677	8033209	One thing you do bring up that's interesting that I didn't think about that could absolutely, because I've actually mentioned it before on the program, is that, you know, an item in Ingress exists, or a pair of items I'm thinking of exist in Ingress called a multi-hack and a heat sink.
8033290	8036152	Because in Ingress, you can only hack a portal for
8036212	8037593	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8059305	8066631	The reason why I bring all that up, not that it's a one-to-one equivalent, because again, and as I said earlier, you have a PvE game and a PvP game.
8066671	8067852	These are very different sorts of things.
8068132	8070174	And by the way, you don't pay for these items.
8070614	8073417	Heatsinks and Multisinks are not paid items in Ingress.
8073477	8075358	You hack them from other portals.
8075719	8079282	They're like items, you know, like cards in your deck that you can play, if you will.
8080423	8081583	I actually think that's a...
8083505	8088929	I'm surprised that monetization isn't already in Pokemon Go, to be quite honest, Deft.
8089370	8098257	Something to cool down the time that you can spin the Pokestop, or that there was never a hard limit on how many times you could spin a Pokestop.
8098737	8099318	and DarkSakura.
8125627	8130010	That might be a thing here that could really piss the fanbase off.
8130230	8137654	I could see that that could be the unpopular change Scopely makes, is they put a hard limit on how many times you could spin that stop.
8137854	8144097	Deft is actually saying, technically there is a limit, but you don't really hit it unless you're completely hardcore.
8144218	8146979	Oh, I never realized you could hit a limit, but I guess that makes sense.
8146999	8147900	Yeah.
8148800	8152762	Yeah, and PogCulture says, or on their couch when the pokey stop is right outside their apartment.
8152802	8154822	Sure, the little free libraries we were talking about earlier.
8155663	8159124	SG100Matt says, surely they'll monetize the gifts.
8159664	8161545	You know why I liked the gifts?
8163254	8167677	That felt like Niantic's original mission to me, to be able to explore the world.
8168078	8177704	Routes are actually supremely underrated in Pokemon Go because the point isn't that great in Pokemon Go.
8177864	8181887	I mean, they're underrated, meaning even by Niantic, they're underdone.
8182167	8186270	The equivalent in Ingress is a huge reason to play the game.
8186651	8189613	Missions is a huge thing that keeps people going in that game.
8190293	8191574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8220174	8241501	Niantic, let's be real Niantic had a little bit of a flash in the pan in some ways they are not good at making games to make money sure they had Pokemon but a lot of their other attempts have not done well I like Pikmin but a lot of you just shit on it and I
8242828	8248069	And I don't mean you specifically in chat, just like a lot of people out there that I talk to, just like, I don't like Pikmin.
8248489	8249529	Have you ever played it?
8250189	8251129	No, but I don't like Pikmin.
8251470	8255050	You know, it's nothing like a game on GameCube through the Switch.
8255070	8255910	I don't care, I don't like it.
8256090	8256930	No, I just don't like it.
8257831	8258131	Okay.
8258711	8259351	You don't like it.
8259431	8259911	Good for you.
8260391	8266732	You know, it's just... I'm worried that Pikmin's going to be the first one to go, but I hope not.
8266812	8267432	I really hope not.
8267472	8269393	I hope the fact that it's got the Nintendo tie-in.
8269413	8271213	But then again, Nintendo is...
8272481	8273542	And neither do I, Bobby.
8273662	8275203	I don't like the console games either.
8275463	8277705	But the mobile phone, again, I swear by it.
8277745	8282189	For walking incentivization, it is the best Niantic game.
8282649	8291676	For that concept of explore the world around you and do shit with your friends in the process, Pikmin is one of the best games on that.
8291996	8293637	And nobody fucking believes me.
8293818	8295439	Except for you and your wife, Bobby.
8296460	8297961	And a few other people out there that play.
8298861	8299082	Alright.
8300208	8302771	Anyway, thank you for the email.
8302811	8303973	I do appreciate the perspective.
8304253	8305675	And yeah, top of the show.
8305695	8306095	We had more.
8306876	8310941	With that, that means we are open to phone calls and so forth.
8311261	8314185	I was going to take Ranma's call tonight, but I noticed he's not here.
8314545	8316728	But was DerpyCon this weekend?
8316748	8318230	Because I think he was posting pictures from that.
8318670	8320512	So he might be out at a convention right now.
8320772	8323073	But if you want to call, you can always join our green room.
8323414	8325956	I encourage you to join our Discord so you can talk to us throughout the week.
8326036	8327957	Vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8328277	8336664	A lot of you like to share stories in our channel, and we will post those throughout the week and read some of those on the show.
8337905	8339826	We minimize the ping.
8340446	8344369	Actually, I don't think we've pinged everybody on the server in years.
8345430	8345890	or Ever.
8346271	8351774	So we don't use that feature, which I know a lot of people can't stand when they join 100 Discord servers is that they're all pinging them.
8352594	8353155	So there's that.
8353235	8354075	So yeah.
8354155	8356897	Mike Def says though, as long as you're not an ass or a bot.
8356997	8357677	Yeah.
8357778	8360659	If you're an ass or a bot, please then do not join.
8361420	8361800	Do not come.
8361820	8364221	And if you're an ass bot, what the fuck are you?
8364301	8367443	If you're an ass bot, come on in because I want to see what that's all about.
8370385	8372386	There is the butt bot in Twitch, right?
8372426	8372586	Yeah.
8377332	8379173	Hey, funny, funny bread.
8379253	8380013	Hey, ass butt.
8380233	8380473	Yeah.
8381373	8382394	As opposed to ass butt.
8383874	8385295	How about some last minute stories?
8385355	8386175	Loki, we have any of those?
8387315	8388376	No, I was looking.
8388436	8388776	No.
8389396	8390036	Nothing.
8390056	8390356	Sorry.
8390516	8390736	Yeah.
8390996	8391276	That's good.
8391296	8393117	We had a pretty busy week, all things considered.
8393177	8395098	So I think with that, we can wrap up.
8395138	8396838	DarkSakura is going to do some streaming.
8397118	8398739	Are you playing Debbie tonight again?
8398819	8399499	Or are you doing?
8399519	8400279	Yeah, I'll play Debbie.
8400419	8400659	Okay.
8400799	8401179	Good times.
8401580	8402540	Oh, I did.
8402780	8403960	I saw the new killer.
8404000	8405081	I was just going to ask.
8405241	8405921	Tokyo Ghoul.
8406141	8406241	Yeah.
8406281	8406361	Yeah.
8418357	8442735	I haven't watched any Tokyo Ghoul but I know a lot of people who are really into it and the character design is very nice the concept of how they move is like this cross between I want to say like Legion and Wesker it's interesting it's really interesting so I'm looking forward to giving it a shot so we'll see
8443303	8468247	it's a little Spider-Man to me because like you attach to walls and like pull yourself to the wall like it I don't know that's kind of the sense I got from it a little bit a little bit no weird I mean I could kind of see it but but at any rate though um we only get the killer we're not getting survivor or a special stage or or anything to that extent it's just gonna be the killer
8469741	8474024	And funny people are saying that his best perks is a yellow one and a brown one.
8475104	8484230	I'm just, look, for the Dead by Daylight fans out there, I'm just happy you finally got your tentacle monster killer and he's sexy.
8485351	8489654	Like, look, they're actually delivering on bringing the sexy tentacle monster into Dead by Daylight.
8489694	8490494	Congratulations.
8490735	8491155	You won.
8491455	8492316	You all beat the game.
8492516	8495057	Your fanfic worked.
8495258	8495718	Congrats.
8497099	8506931	Well, I mean, but there was a thing that they were doing, an event called Tadayama, which means I'm home in Japan last week.
8507671	8510375	And it was them announcing the Tokyo Ghoul thing.
8510395	8513038	DBD is massive in Japan, like super big.
8513819	8514880	So, yeah.
8516408	8517449	There's a lot of talk and chat.
8517469	8523553	Before we wrap up, there's a lot of talk and chat about Looney Tunes because I guess it's going around on socials, on Blue Sky and stuff.
8524154	8528897	SGO100Matt says, I just read that they Zazloved all the classic Looney Tunes off of Max.
8530839	8531519	Yep.
8533781	8534362	I didn't even know.
8534602	8536823	And then they're talking about that there's a new Looney Tunes movie.
8537284	8541167	I didn't even know that there was a new Looney Tunes movie.
8542168	8556433	now I'm kind of curious about it because I see Bobby is saying I kind of wish everyone would go watch the new Looney Tunes movie in the theater this week or at least buy tickets to it if you want to support 2D animation in future films I literally know nothing about it is Bugs Bunny in drag?
8556513	8566717	because I'll go see it for Drag Bugs Bunny by the way I'm thinking about getting a hat with Drags Bug Bunny on it tell me I shouldn't do it
8567170	8567650	Okay, you're right.
8567690	8567970	I should.
8568670	8568990	All right.
8569831	8572991	Oh, Bugs Bunny isn't in it, but Daffy Duck and Porky Pig are.
8573011	8573692	Well, that's cool.
8574552	8576872	We all love Duck Dodgers in the 24th and a half century.
8577352	8579173	Even cold.
8579393	8580933	The day the earth blew up.
8583354	8584574	Okay, I'm down for that.
8584614	8585154	Let's go see it.
8585694	8586515	Do you want to go see it?
8586975	8588035	Yeah, I do.
8588135	8588695	Let's do it.
8589055	8589815	Let's fucking do it.
8589915	8592756	Let's go on an OLR date just for Bobby Blackwolf.
8593296	8593756	Let's do it.
8593896	8594336	Let's go see it.
8594857	8596537	I don't have ballet tomorrow.
8597872	8600194	I have plans tomorrow, but I don't really know.
8600214	8601275	I don't have plans Wednesday.
8601615	8602416	Okay, we can go Wednesday.
8602696	8603236	We'll go Wednesday.
8603377	8603817	Let's do it.
8604137	8604377	All right.
8605198	8605458	Done.
8605598	8606019	Done and done.
8606039	8607280	Are there cheap movie deals on Wednesday?
8607320	8607620	Hopefully.
8608480	8608861	All right.
8609421	8618648	And I literally know nothing about it, but Looney Tunes is just dumb enough, complimentary, that I will probably enjoy it.
8618808	8619709	I don't need to know anymore.
8619749	8621330	I'm like, Looney Tunes cartoons are just dumb.
8621350	8624513	You put them on in the background, they're always fun and mildly entertaining.
8624753	8627095	Again, dumb, parenthesis, complimentary.
8630243	8637390	I am hosting a screening of the movie Sleepaway Camp on Saturday here in Sacramento, which, by the way, I encourage you all to come see.
8637690	8639532	And I know, Loki, you've seen this.
8639812	8642535	Sleepaway Camp, that movie from the 80s with Angela.
8643616	8644357	I slipped through it.
8645298	8665532	Felisa Rose who played Angela in that movie is going to be here live doing live commentary and I have the great delight of sharing the stage with her that night so we are going to have a lot of fun so Sleepaway Camp going to be at the Colonial on Saturday night very excited about that but that movie is also very very dumb complimentary so alright
8667644	8672047	Bobby Blackwell says it's modeled after a sci-fi B-movie from the 50s.
8672167	8673567	I'm even more down for that.
8673888	8674528	That could be cute.
8674548	8675168	That could be fun.
8676569	8679730	Especially if it actually is like Planet 9 from outer space.
8680031	8683612	This island Earth can be yours if the price is right.
8684473	8684673	Ooh.
8685453	8686914	Now SSJ100 Matt's talking.
8686974	8688635	Wonder if it can be enhanced with edibles.
8689495	8690756	Rob, go pick us up some chocolate.
8695066	8698607	Well, I didn't show that on Twitch or anything.
8699548	8699828	What?
8700368	8700648	Nothing.
8700828	8700948	Oh.
8701869	8703089	Well, bring me something then.
8703129	8703789	I'll give you a dollar.
8704850	8707351	Only something that is completely legal in California.
8707391	8708071	It's just candy.
8708251	8708811	It's just candy.
8708891	8710332	It's candy I bought at the store.
8710392	8710932	That's all it is.
8711832	8712192	All right.
8712252	8713033	I hate candy.
8715033	8715353	Okay.
8716014	8716454	Anyway.
8718018	8719659	Let's get those final thoughts.
8719679	8720800	DarkSakura, over to you.
8720820	8720860	Um...
8747465	8749907	I am kind of looking forward to playing.
8749927	8750848	I might just do Killer.
8751108	8751609	Who knows?
8752209	8754711	But I have things to talk about.
8754871	8757393	So come and listen to me talk.
8757593	8758654	Have a good stream.
8758694	8759215	About things.
8759695	8760596	All right, we'll see you in just a moment.
8760656	8762157	There's good things in my future and it makes me happy.
8762297	8763278	So I'll see you later.
8763478	8763958	Yay, happy.
8763978	8767061	All right, we'll see you in a minute.
8767181	8767981	Loki, your final thought.
8769242	8773025	Hopefully I'll have another episode out of my Minecraft series this week.
8773766	8774186	Good times.
8774206	8774987	Trying to get it weekly.
8775287	8775968	I look forward to it.
8777366	8782650	My final thought is, sorry the last couple podcasts have gone up a couple days later on the feed.
8783150	8784171	I won't do that tonight.
8784571	8787513	I've just had some other things going on on Sunday night the last couple weeks.
8787833	8792516	But tonight, I'm home alone, I think, because I think Alan went to the store.
8792536	8793757	So I will have the show up shortly.
8794077	8794878	So sorry about that.
8795218	8798180	But otherwise, thank you as always for your support of the show.
8798320	8799421	You all are wonderful people.
8799881	8800221	Thank you.
8800261	8804244	Thank you for being good people, because as we saw at one point during tonight's show,
8804904	8817170	Not everybody passes the vibe check around here and I appreciate all of you that show up live that have great vibes and bring great vibes to the show and I appreciate all of you that email us and participate on Discord and all the other ways through the podcast feed.
8817530	8819091	We feel those good vibes as well.
8819431	8820912	So keep those good vibes rolling.
8821312	8822553	Have fun gaming this week.
8822613	8825714	I know some of you are going to be real into Xenoblade Chronicles X. Enjoy it.
8825794	8826615	You've been waiting for this.
8826975	8827415	Have a good one.
8827435	8828216	We'll see you in seven days.
8828276	8828456	Bye.
8830597	8832878	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
8835189	8835850	See you next week.
