39537	42338	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42378	46841	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46961	49302	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49342	55985	We are live once again with our program for tonight, February the 9th of 2025.
56125	59307	I almost said February 29th, but that wouldn't be accurate, now would it?
59327	66150	Let's try February 9th, 2025 with episode number 1035 of our program.
66210	69012	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you each and every week.
69372	70293	with my co-hosts.
70393	72975	First up, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
74516	74836	Hello.
75116	76137	Hello, how are you doing?
80260	80881	Yeah, okay.
81181	87126	I'm having quite the overwhelming day.
87186	88287	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
88307	91249	I hope the show can relax you a little.
91269	93270	You know when you got a lot on your plate?
93411	93631	Mm-hmm.
94361	118213	and suddenly it's like it would be better if I didn't care about any of that yeah I I sort of like my brain is like shut off and going no stop thinking about things just just sit on the internet all day uh you know especially considering everything going on in the world at a very rapid pace I I think you are certainly not alone in a lot of those feelings and um
119907	121008	It's a lot for anybody.
121668	127212	But, you know, continuing to persist is to continue to resist.
127532	130074	So keep on keeping on best y'all can.
131114	132996	Now I'm just going to live in a cave.
134717	135417	That works too.
135557	136258	That works too.
137018	138219	Remember the OLR fort?
139120	140601	We need to bring back the OLR fort.
141994	142555	Who was that?
142595	146160	What was that guy's name that lived out there in the middle of nowhere and you had to drive by that fort?
146540	151187	It was one of DDR Angel, well, back when she was DDR Angel, Tech Angels, one of her buddies.
152148	156394	It's been so long, I can't remember the guy's name, but yeah.
156454	158176	To get to his house, you had to drive by a big fort.
158857	160858	And we always used to joke it would be the OLR fort.
160938	167019	It was one of those places with giant ass walls that like somebody just had a piece of land and, you know, had their cameras up.
167059	174381	It was basically like, you know, this is that we don't recognize the government in these walls like that, that type of establishment.
175001	177342	So I would love to have an OLR fort someday.
177642	178022	It'd be good.
178752	184915	I mean, we could just purchase an oil rig off the coast that no one uses and live on that like those other people did.
186296	187077	Oh, that's right.
187117	187397	That's right.
187437	188938	Or a click over Alcatraz or something.
190899	191199	All right.
192159	197442	Well, let's say hello to somebody who surely has a, you know, Apocalypse Day plan.
197923	199223	Say hello to Deckmaster Loki.
199243	200724	Hello.
200964	201345	Hi, Loki.
201385	201725	How are you?
201745	201845	Hello.
202728	203849	I don't have an apocalypse.
203969	204970	When's Apocalypse Day?
205691	206151	Who knows?
207492	208253	2032, the asteroid.
208493	210555	That's the new Apocalypse Day.
211516	212136	The asteroid in 2032.
212216	220544	I was told today was a new holiday, but only for people that are weird and have racist tendencies.
221867	222948	Football games?
223428	224488	No, no, no, no, no.
224928	230891	It's Golf of America Day, a holiday that literally no one will recognize because it's stupid.
231811	236673	No, I did not hear that that was a thing, but as I... Who do you think?
236893	237513	Who do you think?
240074	242875	The rest of the world does not recognize that stupidity?
264476	267038	Why do you think I've been using metrics for the last two years?
270680	271020	Alright.
271820	272721	Well, video games.
273721	275362	They can't take our video games yet.
275422	276303	They'll probably try.
276443	281025	But for now, we have lots of video games to talk about and things in the news.
281065	283687	I'm actually kind of surprised they haven't tried to come for video games yet.
283747	285067	But, you know, give it time.
285928	286488	Give them time.
286768	287469	And you know what?
287689	289590	Indie games are always going to be a thing.
289610	289770	Yeah.
289770	293232	You can't take away, you know, and the whole like once on the internet, always on the internet.
293372	297195	We have these things about Nintendo trying to take things down and then they're never really down.
297595	301477	They're down so the lawyers can't see them, but they live on torrent sites forever.
301597	306540	So, yeah, I mean, if you're Grand Theft Auto 6, you might be a little nervous right now.
306660	310083	But, you know, indie games are never going to take that away.
310883	311203	All right.
312804	318168	Let's get into, well, I guess video games were taken away for about 24 hours this weekend, right, Loki?
318188	318668	What happened?
319727	322330	Yeah, so PlayStation Network went down.
323050	326334	They had a major outage that lasted 24 hours.
326954	330097	And I don't even think it was necessarily just PlayStation Network.
330177	334742	It was apparently anything connected to Sony Online Services.
334902	338926	So multiplayer, PlayStation Store, PlayStation Network stuff.
338966	342269	I heard there was even like movie stuff that was affected by that as well.
342390	342790	Oh, weird.
342870	343250	I don't know.
344691	371057	I was trying to play No Man's Sky and I couldn't upload my discoveries to the No Man's Sky database on PlayStation which that thing kind of tends to be like I feel like that thing is held together with duct tape because it doesn't you know it's up and down a lot but like I would go into the multiplayer hub and it was empty so it was it was affecting that game for sure even though I'm pretty sure they run their own servers well I mean I we don't really know why it went down but uh
372170	381998	It's kind of interesting that around about the time that, you know, the PlayStation Network went down for 24 hours that they laid off a ton of people, so... Really?
382939	385361	Wait, so Sony laid off people this weekend?
386081	386742	I believe so, yeah.
386762	387702	Oh, I didn't hear about that.
388943	389544	Interesting.
389924	392626	It was pretty close to the time that it...
394383	397245	Yeah, it was... No, you're fine.
397305	403009	So maybe, hypothetically, somebody could have pulled the plug on their way out the door.
405251	405631	Maybe.
406012	415178	Which, I mean... Or they laid somebody off that had the job of keeping that up.
416219	417760	It could be one or the other, yeah.
419342	421843	I think about the movie Airplane with the guy holding that plug.
421923	423405	That's kind of, you know...
424841	425902	The Image I Have in My Head
455181	481603	that like it may have gone down for an hour or a blip here and there but this 24-hour outage was the longest it's been down since that three-week incident it was like 21 21 days 24 days it was a long time yeah so this comes from uh so allegedly uh this comes from uh Ryosuke Hana who posted on Twitter and Mastodon saying that uh most of my team was just laid off at PlayStation uh
482323	484664	It was a dream to get to work there on the platform.
484704	492105	I've grown up since the PlayStation 1 and contributed to the PlayStation 5 portal, PSVR 2, and the PS app and future consoles.
493606	502488	So yeah, apparently from there, we don't know how many people were laid off, but some at least, including his whole team.
502912	506615	Wow, that sucks, to say the least.
507195	511239	But I didn't even think of the idea that somebody could have.
512260	514321	Allegedly, it's what we have no evidence.
514381	516683	It's just one of those funky timing sort of things.
517163	527252	But it does bring that idea that, wow, with all these people getting laid off, it's a little bit surprising that more of them don't take negative action on their way out the door.
527312	528513	I mean, this is why companies...
529551	537734	You know, usually escort people at the building, whether they were, you know, really, really good spotless employees or otherwise.
537894	545357	But that's just very fascinating that that timing alludes to that there could be a possibility there.
545397	551199	And that, quite frankly and honestly, we don't see more of it happening with all of the layoffs in the gaming industry.
551779	553600	So, fascinating.
553620	553700	Yeah.
554460	564694	hmm I'm sure we'll hear more about that probably this week yeah I well I will we I feel like Sony I feel like Sony because what Sony's offered a consolation prize through all this right
567096	568337	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
589460	591340	So, yeah.
591400	592080	S2100 Matt in chat.
592100	600922	Because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
600982	603482	Except Bobby Blackwolf is not on tonight.
603562	607163	He is enjoying Wingstop Takeout with friends at a social gathering.
608063	611944	So, S2100 Matt says, the internet demands over this outage are insane.
612404	614084	Demanding free games, etc.
614204	617525	Five days of PlayStation Plus seems reasonable for a one-day outage.
617585	617965	Yeah, I...
619065	644151	I think the demand of free games is maybe a little much but um you know I don't know like the games I play were not super affected so I don't know like you know if you're like a big Marvel rivals person on PlayStation and you just like could not play that game so like I could see why people are mad but they're not yeah the call for free games is a lot hmm
645382	647243	And yeah, I mean, SJ100 Matt is right.
647643	648744	Network outages happen.
649464	652246	We had some rainstorms here that have been moving across the country.
652346	655568	And, you know, you never know what weather can do and all that stuff.
655648	660090	Not to excuse it, but, you know, it's interesting.
660391	664793	And I just think Sony's going to come out and say, we're going to give you this five days.
664953	666074	Now sit down and shut up.
666174	672858	And I don't think they're – I mean, I'm trying to think if they might have a legal reason to disclose it to stockholders.
673789	686076	that if stockholders may grill them about it in their next shareholder meeting, that's like probably the only way I could see that the answer to why this happened comes out is if the investors demand the reasoning.
686456	694261	And even then, I'm not sure that really comes out in a spot for public consumption, unless of course it's leaked, which is almost certainly inevitable in this case.
694381	694621	Right.
694721	699164	I think, I mean, I think if they compensate players with five days, like
701002	710244	We really care why it went down for I mean, they may care more like is this going to happen again very soon but like it hardly ever goes down and for 24 hours it's like
711092	711432	Yeah.
711813	713395	It's not a huge deal.
713415	716498	The bigger question will be, was it a hack?
716899	718621	Was it any personal data at risk?
718761	722085	Because that was what happened all that time ago.
722605	726329	The data was at risk, and that's what led to the class action, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
726990	731595	So that would be the big maybe in this whole picture is if –
732276	736098	You know, there was actually, like, data that leaked as a result.
736238	737778	That's a question they're going to have to ask.
737818	739639	And that may be as much of an answer as we get.
740159	744521	We have determined the cause of the downtime, and it was an unexpected situation.
745001	746902	No bad actors got into the system.
747182	748322	And that'll be it.
748722	749603	That'll be the explanation.
750683	752644	Shit happens, but your data's okay.
757484	759485	I don't know you shit
779850	780831	But I'm not sure.
781151	788896	Usually if there was a type of coordinated attack like that, some group is probably claiming responsibility in why they did it at this point.
789456	790296	Not necessarily.
790316	791137	It doesn't have to be.
791617	804045	But usually, especially for an impressive quote-unquote amount of downtime, you would think somebody would be claiming responsibility for it and why they're going to keep doing it to Sony, what they have to change.
804565	806086	But that part we're not really hearing.
806766	807647	So I don't know.
807687	808347	I'm not saying...
809628	813687	It's completely off the table, but Sony's going to have to clear that up.
815697	819158	Yeah, and DarkTetsuya says apparently this took out everything from Sony, not just PSN.
819178	820798	Yeah, Loki did refer to that a little bit.
821878	826419	But that is interesting that it could be like other Sony network-based services.
826880	829140	So would that mean things like I would assume like Crunchyroll?
829240	831641	Isn't that like a Sony service too and things?
831721	836182	I don't know if they were – maybe they ran on different – I'm not able to log into Crunchyroll stuff on my phone.
836662	839863	Yeah, I don't know if they use the same login for that even though it's owned by that.
840063	840903	All right, fair.
840983	841223	Maybe.
841263	841603	I don't know.
842369	845841	Alright, interesting though I mean, I've been playing Fruit Mountain, so it works
848123	848423	All right.
848823	853667	Well, yeah, bummer about the outage because I'm sure a lot of people want to play games this weekend.
853727	856508	But, you know, things happen.
856708	865174	Interesting discussion had got brought up in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, where, of course, you can join and talk with us throughout the week.
865214	866775	And some folks were talking about this.
867355	871518	And some people had highlighted a social media post from GameStop.
871998	875380	So GameStop had actually done a quote post and said –
877542	879343	Don't you wish you had physical games now?
880204	891974	Something to that effect was the post, because GameStop's trying to needle the fact that I guess they got done in by a lot of the shift that we've had to digital games.
892514	895657	But then, of course, there was the dunk on the dunk, which...
895717	895937	So, hmm.
918521	926305	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, in terms of the layoffs and doing something on your way out the door, it's best not to burn the bridge you're standing on.
926705	928826	You pull the plug, leak info, etc.
928906	933729	You run the risk of never getting a gig in that industry or anything related unless that's your goal.
934469	939833	Yeah, I mean, you bring up a good point, but I think you also get to where I'm thinking with the second half of that.
940333	943175	And like, I know a lot of people that love the games industry.
943255	944156	They love being in it.
944196	952161	They realize it can be a roller coaster, but at the end of the day, they just like, they love video games and they put up with all this BS to be making games.
952241	954323	But I know other people in the industry that...
955496	962943	Kind of want to get out of it, you know, because of all this like living on the edge and the uncertainty and you get to a point where you're like, I need some stability.
963363	966606	And there are some people I think that are looking for, you know –
968010	977336	Other types of jobs that utilize those similar, you know, coding, artistic, you know, project, all the stuff that goes into making a game, all those types of skills.
977856	979917	Yeah, a student on Matt in chat says, gig income is rough.
980297	986041	So I think there may be some people that, especially in light of the fact that we have had so many layoffs,
986661	989382	in the last year and the industry is getting so competitive.
989863	999588	There may be, I would actually go so far as to say there's certainly a non-zero amount of employees that when they're getting laid off are going to go, you know what?
999968	1000928	Fuck video games.
1001409	1001869	Fuck it.
1002149	1002529	I'm out.
1003970	1008512	And so, yeah, I think although, yeah, what you're saying is true.
1008592	1009813	People don't want to burn bridges.
1010613	1015356	I think there are definitely people in the gaming industry that are like, may the bridges I burn light my way out the door.
1017136	1019638	and that's how it goes.
1022261	1029468	Anyway, let's talk a little bit about our gaming week and the types of things that we have been playing this week on PlayStation or otherwise.
1030909	1032190	DarkSakura, we'll start with you, of course.
1032230	1032851	How was your gaming week?
1035493	1037374	I played some Dragon Age.
1037434	1038494	I played some DBD.
1038574	1039714	I played Fruit Mountain.
1040134	1041635	That's about it.
1043395	1045856	I'm still recovering on my leg.
1046516	1048436	And I've been working a lot in my office.
1049056	1056958	So I'm actually off doing a lot of activity for another two weeks on my leg.
1057458	1061899	So I've just been trying to focus on more IRL stuff, I guess.
1062780	1064280	If I can get done well.
1066547	1069328	I just was going to say, I did see a little bit of your Dragon Age stream the other night.
1070489	1071969	Oh, cool.
1072449	1074390	Basically me yelling at the other people in the game.
1074530	1074970	Pretty much.
1077652	1080033	Yeah, but I mean, I'm on my third playthrough.
1080053	1081053	I started my third playthrough.
1081073	1085275	I just finished my second one on Friday.
1086395	1086655	Nice.
1087216	1089717	I'm moving on to playing a Grey Warden.
1090397	1090537	Hmm.
1094604	1101206	When you talk about talking back to the game, it makes me think about how some of the comments as people are like, is Dragon Age sort of finished?
1101226	1108927	There was that random... I don't want to say random comment, but there was the comment from one of the people that worked on the game that was like, well, it belongs to fans, basically.
1108947	1113008	The Dragon Age will never die because of the fans type of thing.
1113628	1120210	And I don't know, when you talk about making your own canon with yelling back at the characters, it just kind of makes me think of that.
1120290	1120630	I don't know.
1120990	1121910	I guess my point is...
1122310	1124611	I just yell back at the characters because they do stupid things.
1126812	1130054	Not like making my own universe or anything.
1130074	1133115	I'm just yelling at people because they do stupid stuff and they frustrate me.
1134015	1135856	Well, maybe there needs to be a character that yells at them.
1135876	1139058	That's literally it.
1139838	1140178	Alright.
1140778	1141899	Maybe it's my own
1143470	1165885	I don't know I just it's like what are you doing people like why do you make the most stupid decision possible when you know it's gonna fuck up shit for me and my character like knock it off that's kind of how I feel yeah all right well we'll go to Loki how was you gonna feel that way about real life too I was gonna say it hits a little close to home uh Loki how was your good week
1167080	1169622	It was pretty much all Minecraft again.
1170522	1174785	Just getting ready for the server stuff for this weekend.
1175725	1181709	Getting the World Tour server up and a lot of server admin stuff, essentially.
1182409	1183029	Which went well.
1183209	1189913	We had some streamers come in yesterday and stream from the server and kind of showcase that to their fans.
1190394	1191214	So that was nice.
1191234	1192755	And then today we've been holding public...
1195602	1197023	It's been open to the public, essentially.
1197043	1200566	I've been just kind of touring around with people, helping them out with things.
1201126	1202687	That's what I've been working on all week.
1202727	1206790	And just getting ready for the launch of the next season, which is going to start this Saturday.
1208171	1209492	So that'll be a lot of fun.
1209532	1211453	We'll be starting Season 4, Brand New World.
1211493	1213214	I've already started my starter base.
1213354	1214215	It looks awesome.
1215616	1217397	So yeah, looking forward to kicking that off.
1218614	1236893	if OLR listeners want to check out that Minecraft stuff that you made public especially because you know the water ride was obviously a huge part of that we talked about that on a prior show if OLR listeners want to get in on that and go play and check that out I would hope they've seen the video at this point but how can they actually go in there and play it for themselves
1237697	1250639	Yeah, pretty much the easiest way would be to go to my YouTube channel, so LokiOLR on YouTube, and go there and check out either the community posts or really any of my videos.
1251764	1257346	I mean, recently from Channel 64, there'll be a link in there to the Channel 64 community Discord.
1257906	1273692	And you go in there, just essentially join that Discord, and you'll see basically a thread about the event server and what you need to log into it, the Minecraft instance you need, and the mods and resource pack.
1273812	1275873	So it has all that information as well as the IP.
1275953	1277634	So it's going to be open for like a few weeks.
1277974	1278194	Nice.
1278714	1279175	Go check it out.
1279515	1280396	It's a lot of fun.
1280456	1284599	Everybody that has seen the park and everything so far has been blown away.
1286560	1288321	They cannot believe the stuff that they're seeing.
1289502	1290283	Highly recommend it.
1291034	1291434	Good for you.
1292354	1293835	A lot of effort went into that.
1293875	1300396	There's a reason we come here on your gaming weeks and 95% of the time you're saying it is Minecraft because you put a lot of work into it.
1300837	1302717	Yes, and the other 5% is Bellaltro.
1305598	1305998	Perfect.
1306078	1314880	On both PC and phone, mostly phone, but yeah, it's Bellatro is a good time killer and is entertaining.
1315580	1315720	Awesome.
1315740	1317241	I want to try modded Bellatro.
1317321	1318241	That gets really crazy.
1318874	1320115	Oh, that's a thing.
1320596	1321296	What am I saying?
1321696	1323178	I'm literally saying that's a thing.
1323458	1324379	Of course it's a thing.
1324519	1328903	Of course it's just I hadn't heard of what the modders... Let me rephrase.
1329083	1331625	I hadn't heard of what the modders are doing to Bellatro.
1331985	1334247	They've done some interesting things.
1334267	1339292	So they've got like, I don't even know if it's like a specific mod or what, but there's one that like introduces like almost...
1339892	1341193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1369452	1370493	It gets kind of crazy.
1370993	1371673	Okay, neat.
1372694	1381718	There was a good video, I think RT Gaming had done a video on it because he's been playing a lot of Bellatro and it just looked insane.
1381778	1384099	It's just ridiculous.
1384480	1385220	Nice, alright.
1387079	1388360	Let's see, my gaming week.
1389081	1392686	Honestly, probably 95% of my gaming week this week was No Man's Sky.
1393167	1400777	I did a stream on Monday to get in on some of the Twitch drops because I missed most of that being out when I was out of town last weekend.
1402339	1411042	So I did a stream on Monday to try to like, you know, collect some of the Twitch stuff that was available that day and, you know, just kind of, you know, play a little No Man's Sky with the viewers and stuff.
1411542	1416044	And after that, I kind of found like I was really drawn to go back to my save.
1416564	1418825	I started on PlayStation and
1418885	1433628	This is important because most of my No Man's Sky play until now has been on the Xbox system, whether that's literally on an Xbox Series X, which is where I played it most of the pandemic, or on Windows environment, which is where I usually stream it from.
1434849	1440610	But this was notable because I said, you know what, I want to play on PlayStation because I want to get a platinum trophy.
1440770	1442991	I know it's silly, but it gives me a goal.
1443011	1444071	It gives me something to work towards.
1444771	1458717	and I have just kind of fallen into it all over again because most of the play I've been doing in No Man's Sky over the last few years were when they do these limited time expeditions and I focus on the expeditions and once I'm done, I'm done.
1459217	1466020	I haven't really focused on like the main storyline in a while and they've added a lot to it with all these different patches.
1466180	1471803	I actually feel like as I'm playing the game now, I'm not experiencing as much of the world's part two
1471903	1472503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1489392	1490472	But I'm really enjoying it.
1490572	1498394	I mean, the thing is, of course, and this is what No Man's Sky is infamous for, you think you're going down the main story and then it's like three branches open up here.
1498714	1501295	And then you get a pass that opens up a whole other branch over here.
1501335	1506256	I mean, it is just ADHD unhinged in that game.
1506496	1509237	And you can do all these different things, but that's okay.
1509297	1510277	Space is limitless.
1510317	1515699	And I think once you just kind of let go of like, a game like this doesn't really end.
1516619	1521363	Then it doesn't really matter which order you take all these, you know, different quests and things like that.
1521383	1523345	And you just kind of work on things a little bit at a time.
1524206	1525307	But I'm working on my Platinum.
1525367	1527309	I think I have three of the golds I need.
1527889	1533254	I think I have the golds for Aliens, Talk To, Words Learned, and...
1534495	1543261	Oh, credits, units that I've gotten, but I still have to get like walking, survival on planets, scanning all the animals on planets.
1543281	1548524	There's still a few more I have to get, but I think I'll be able to get the platinum in that before too long.
1549384	1556769	Other than that, I've been playing a little bit of Diablo 4, of course, because there's a Lunar New Year event going on with some limited time cosmetics and things like that.
1556829	1563553	So I want to earn a few of those rewards, but most of the week I've been distracted with No Man's Sky and I've been having a good time.
1564144	1588633	so yeah I except I think I need a new PlayStation 5 controller I've had this one for a while and now some of the vibrating feels really weird in the controller like the and the buttons aren't like doing the force feedback I think the way it's supposed to I think I might need a new PS5 controller which sucks because those things are expensive but I guess it has been like five years so it's just annoying
1590017	1596602	Alright, and some of the chatters in our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network are talking about Community Day and Pokemon Go.
1596963	1598844	Yeah, I went out and did that for about an hour.
1599004	1602487	I didn't do that the whole time, but I went for an hour and just caught mostly Bluetooth.
1602827	1603748	And I'm with you guys.
1603888	1606050	It wasn't very giving on the Shinies today.
1606470	1611914	I got three of those Carablast, the little blue bug guys, who I actually really like.
1611995	1612675	I like the Carablast.
1613676	1617019	And then I got one of the Shell thing, the Shellmet.
1617699	1618239	I only got one.
1618779	1620920	So I was like, all right.
1621160	1623561	I guess it's just a little stingy today, that's all.
1624542	1632205	But luckily, the amount of care I have on Pokemon Go these days is extremely minimal.
1632725	1639307	It's something I do on my walks to make me feel just a little bit of a reward, a little bit of a shiny, literally in this case.
1640148	1641128	But otherwise, eh.
1642708	1644510	All right, let's move on.
1644530	1650297	We got some news to get into as we travel around the gaming world this week.
1651318	1656564	I know a lot of people are distracted by games on television, but there's still a lot of video game news going on.
1656605	1657425	So let's get into it.
1658126	1659067	Loki, what do you have for us?
1659790	1667113	Exactly, and the best thing to do between now and when we actually get the news is speculate on the news.
1667254	1668694	Make it up for clicks, Loki.
1669014	1670295	Make it up for engagement.
1670695	1674217	Give you our guesses as to what we think is going to happen.
1674237	1674477	That's right.
1674497	1676118	You won't believe guest number three.
1677901	1682186	Some experts have called us insane for number four.
1683968	1685489	Experts have predicted.
1686570	1693037	So experts are predicting, or some experts, let's not lump in all the experts into this, okay?
1693238	1694799	That's right, not all experts.
1694859	1698103	Experts are predicting that the Nintendo Switch 2...
1699722	1701484	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1718411	1719632	Thank you for watching!
1737650	1743535	is currently rising and the exchange rate in the environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.
1743975	1745736	You don't say!
1746857	1753343	And this is from the president, Shintaro Furukawa of Nintendo.
1754223	1755104	And this was during their...
1756539	1785182	Investor Call says also we need to consider affordable prices our customers from Nintendo products when considering price of our products we believe that's necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles so essentially you know hey we are very conscientious of the cost of our console to which I say $3.99 doesn't seem like that's out of the realm of possibility plausible
1787369	1812197	plausible yeah uh but yes apparently uh there's this analyst Reyes Elliott that says at least it's not the other one there's that other analyst every every goddamn time there's a prediction it's from him like every goddamn time it's that analyst we don't I don't hear about him anymore I welcome our new our I well what's this guy's name again
1813850	1819274	So IGN has interviewed several industry analysts.
1822176	1823877	Apparently there's a sweet spot.
1823917	1824517	Wait, who is it?
1824537	1825218	What's the person's name?
1826118	1827139	Rise Elliot.
1827259	1828260	Rise Elliot.
1828340	1830361	Welcome to the gaming analyst community.
1830441	1831822	Good luck and don't fuck it up.
1832721	1836184	and Ampere Analysis, Pierce Harding roles.
1836564	1842448	He basically said that early adopters will be price sensitive and price can always be lowered.
1842869	1847292	Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is announced at.
1847952	1848433	Wow.
1849413	1851295	So glad that you're industry experts.
1851755	1856679	I'm like, that's not exactly a bold prediction because I'm sitting there going, yeah.
1856699	1856779	Yeah.
1857705	1859786	These people get paid money for their predictions.
1881520	1894867	Yeah, the TLDR is... Most of the modern consoles nowadays are coming out at $499, and Nintendo's hardware probably won't be as powerful as those, so it'll probably be $399, because that makes sense.
1895047	1903692	Obviously, it's not going to be $299, because that's too inexpensive for what they're going to put in the box, so it makes sense that it's $399, because that is...
1904412	1909714	about, you know, a generation or so behind, and that's kind of where they're at price point-wise.
1910194	1915696	All of this, though, said, like... Like, you don't need to hire an analyst for this kind of stuff.
1915756	1916516	Like, honestly.
1917136	1921518	It's just... Yes, the price point will be somewhere.
1921738	1925619	It will probably be affordable and not too expensive as to drive off customers.
1926499	1926799	Yes.
1927340	1927800	Yes, sir.
1927860	1930941	That's exactly what it would be, because that's how we price things.
1930961	1931501	Right.
1933343	1945076	DarkTetsuya in chat says more armchair analysts go figure well that's because most of the people investing money in video games don't play video games this is an analyst that gets paid by industry like that
1946294	1952218	Yeah, Dr. Sia says, I do like Rob's prediction on 479 and comes with Mario Kart.
1952278	1953379	I'd be okay with that one.
1953419	1953959	Well, thank you.
1954599	1963865	Do remember, though, that was only my prediction for how might the tariffs fuck this all up if that actually becomes a thing, which for China it is.
1964066	1965546	I don't even know anymore.
1965586	1967408	This guy makes so fucking many threats and stuff.
1967488	1972511	I can't even remember which ones are which, but I do believe the China ones did go into effect earlier.
1972991	1982794	Um, and so, yeah, I mean, we, we, it'll depend again on how many of those parts did Nintendo already get before assembling them.
1982854	1988276	And if they buy them into, I, I, I'm going to be honest, I really don't know how this works.
1988536	1997318	If they get them from China, but then build them in another country and then bring them in from that country to here that isn't subject to tariffs, does it get tariffed?
1997398	1998518	I don't, I don't really know.
1999279	2000139	Um, so, yeah.
2002042	2002462	We'll see.
2002822	2019090	So I am putting that footnote that I don't think they will bundle it with a game unless they need to to keep the costs down because of these short-sighted tariff things and oops, I fucked the economy, that whole thing.
2024192	2024933	Anything else on Switch 2?
2026567	2032292	Yes, we have, of course, more things other than just speculating on what the cost is going to be.
2033533	2038237	Also, Nintendo is doing what they can to stop scalpers.
2039318	2045923	We kind of heard this before, that they're going to be doing something, but we haven't really heard what exactly that would be.
2046604	2052489	So we will take all possible measures on the experience we have accumulated to date.
2053109	2081640	regarding scalpers and the like well I mean the only thing they have to do is make enough consoles period and that's not gonna scalpers won't be an issue the other option too along with that is you know maybe doing some pre-orders through Nintendo online which they've done for like things that you wouldn't think would necessarily be part of that like Alarmo so maybe they do something like that I don't know but that's kind of all
2082796	2084077	They've really said so far.
2084938	2086059	Well, I do.
2086339	2088281	I'm actually going to give them the benefit of the doubt.
2088421	2093265	I understand why they don't want to say more, because they don't want the scalpers to know what they're going to do.
2093545	2098449	If you say it's going to work like this, then that gives the scalpers X many months to figure out how to fuck with the system.
2099910	2102452	But I would assume...
2103513	2104233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2121058	2129645	But I don't think you'll see the level of like people at Costco fighting over pallets full of Pokemon cards that they want to go flip on eBay type of thing.
2130025	2140373	I don't think it's going to be that lawless when it comes to at least – I think that's what Nintendo is aiming for because we've seen that how many times like with the NES Classic and that shit when that was all released.
2140453	2141714	That was a thing.
2142774	2145356	So I can see why they –
2146397	2147678	might want to do the pre-order again.
2147698	2151542	That's what Sony did for PlayStation 5 for a while, right?
2151863	2156087	Because they were trying to combat scalping with limited success.
2156247	2156587	I think...
2157927	2186621	PlayStation 5s were just impossible to get a hold of scalping or not they just weren't making enough of them but that that goes into you know COVID related issues and all that true that's yeah I'm not like yeah do I fault PlayStation for the shortage a little bit but I also understand there was a world event that happened that's really Sony could not have planned for and you know it's also during the time when they had all those chip shortages and all that stuff too yeah so there was a lot of that yeah um
2187621	2204884	The last thing too, kind of feeding into some of the speculation that's already occurred regarding the initial launch trailer of the Switch 2 which made it seem like the new Joy-Cons would be able to be used in some sort of fashion like a mouse on their side and rolling on a surface
2205405	2212893	And apparently there is now a patent that Nintendo has registered that does kind of allude to that functionality.
2213494	2219600	So it is possible that that is going to be how they're going to be used, or at least one way they could be used.
2219620	2225946	It says this input device comprises of the front surface, the upper surface, and the first side surface.
2226727	2243486	and it says along that the sensor for the mouse operation detects the reflected light from the detected surface and the light changing by moving the detected so it's an optical mouse essentially it operates like an optical mouse on the side of the controller and you can move it around though I say that like
2245904	2247926	What kind of surface are we talking about moving around on?
2247946	2254451	Because if you're playing it, maybe on a table or something, but I know if I'm playing on the couch, that's not going to be comfortable.
2254631	2256954	Yeah, no, unless you have a book or something.
2258014	2258895	Yeah, we'll have to see.
2259416	2261638	It's neat that the option's there, I guess.
2261658	2264280	Were you going to say something, Jamie?
2266730	2267850	Oh, okay.
2268511	2272892	I was thinking, I'm not the first to say this, but I definitely don't want to be the last.
2273452	2281835	If we're going to have mouse functionality on the new Nintendo Switch, then are we getting a new Mario Paint, finally?
2282575	2286537	At least we better fucking get Mario Paint on Nintendo Switch Online.
2287057	2289217	And then there was like one other mouse game.
2289337	2290238	I think it was one, was it...
2291278	2293620	or maybe, did Lemmings use the mouse as well?
2294260	2294801	It might have.
2295361	2299164	I think there was a King Arthur related game that used the mouse as well.
2299184	2304648	There was some other game that I think was like a Lemmings was popular so we made this as well type of thing.
2305288	2305308	I...
2307773	2309435	Why not just make Mario Music Maker?
2326499	2327000	I love it.
2327320	2327840	I love it.
2328140	2328721	Yeah.
2329241	2333824	Deft in chat says Mario Maker 3, but now you can create your own assets.
2334365	2334865	I love it.
2335045	2335525	Oh my God.
2335846	2345272	That would open the door to like a Super Mario Maker 3 where this time you can paint the bricks and the assets in the game and then make your own level music.
2345512	2346593	That would be incredible.
2347133	2350155	Except, you know, the time to penis on a game like that?
2350495	2350996	Oh, wow.
2351016	2351276	Yeah.
2351676	2360168	Nintendo, and what I mean by that of course is how long before somebody makes a level, the big bag of dicks level, where everything is a dick.
2360709	2363213	Mario's a dick, the bricks are dicks, everything's a dick.
2363753	2366217	That would come out in less than a minute.
2366517	2367118	Less than a minute.
2368025	2368886	Always have to be dicks.
2369826	2371307	Can't it be like a twat or something?
2371907	2378271	It could be, but you and I both know that these silly people, they're going to draw big dicks first.
2378311	2379332	That's what they always do.
2379812	2380773	But they can't, of course.
2380973	2382834	Where are the levels with the hairy clams?
2383594	2387376	After the dicks comes the twats and the boobs and the butts.
2387536	2387917	No, no, no.
2388037	2389017	Twats first.
2390078	2391959	Well, what do you think about that?
2394320	2394981	I can't say.
2395001	2395321	Okay.
2401658	2402099	Alright.
2403360	2403840	Hi, Rob.
2404301	2404561	Hi.
2407003	2408024	Orange, right in chat.
2408885	2409806	Okay, I'm sorry.
2410046	2410287	Sorry.
2410607	2414291	This is the first time I've stopped reading a comment to read somebody else's comment.
2414311	2414931	I'll go back, though.
2415892	2418435	PogCulture in chat says, Mario Peen.
2418835	2419596	Exactly.
2419876	2420577	Exactly.
2421758	2422419	Mario Peent.
2424818	2425318	Orange, right?
2425338	2428243	The comment I was going to read says Magic Pen Gel Reboot?
2429484	2433791	Imagine Nintendo just fucking swiping the Magic Pen Gel concept and making their own game.
2433951	2434532	Amazing.
2434752	2437055	My platform is here.
2439499	2440560	Dicks are not default.
2443636	2461648	Oh, SSJ100Matt with some facts, courtesy of Wikipedia Games that ran on the Super Nintendo Mouse Holy fuck, there were like 30 games that ran on this Oh, a bunch of them were Japan only We disturb our explicitness with facts Oh my god, how dare you?
2462228	2462709	How dare you?
2463189	2470013	This is a video game podcast Where did you think facts were going to be allowed, SSJ100Matt?
2470053	2470674	How dare you?
2471454	2471935	Facts
2473051	2476474	You show me any video game podcast where facts matter.
2478095	2480897	Show me a YouTube channel where the facts are relevant.
2485600	2487281	Okay, wow, I did not know.
2487561	2490884	So there was a port of Civilization on the Super Nintendo.
2490964	2492705	That I knew, but it used the mouse.
2492805	2495367	That I didn't know because I played it on an actual PC.
2495987	2498349	Revolution X. With ActRaiser?
2499304	2500364	No, not with Actraiser.
2502105	2504046	Revolution X, use the mouse.
2505186	2506186	And Terminator 2.
2506627	2507227	Wow.
2508287	2508887	Arcade game.
2509608	2510868	I'll be damned.
2511668	2512188	Let's see.
2512969	2513689	SimAnt.
2514709	2518671	See, I forget most of these games were even on the Super Nintendo because I always think of them as PC games.
2519111	2519791	SimAnt.
2521152	2522892	Vegas Stakes, use the mouse?
2523872	2524173	What?
2525313	2526473	Wow, alright.
2527114	2527894	Well, shit.
2531002	2533423	Alright, well, damn, shut me up here.
2533503	2536604	I think there were like three games that used the mouse.
2537324	2540044	But a lot of those were Japan and PAL region games.
2540405	2543125	So when you take those out, it's down to like maybe 20.
2544486	2546346	So 3, 20, what's the difference?
2547026	2550927	What's even crazier now is the homebrew scene, especially even on the Nintendo side.
2550987	2558429	I've seen creators have an adapter for the Nintendo mouse to make it work on the NES with games.
2558630	2559910	And there's one that's like a
2562063	2571690	It's like a... I don't... It's sort of like a Myst-type game or something like that.
2572171	2579176	I don't know what you would necessarily... Not a hidden image, but it's like a puzzle game where you navigate around the screen using the mouse and stuff.
2579536	2580377	Go to different rooms.
2581454	2596339	Now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, though, I will say what this list has made me think of is I'm looking there at all these PC games that I kind of forgot existed on Super Nintendo that supported the mouse, like The Civilization, The Sim Ant, and those sorts of things.
2596879	2604061	And it does make me think of, hear me out here, the great debate about controller versus keyboard and mouse.
2605126	2613413	So hypothetically, hypothetically, let's say that Microsoft is going to release Halo Master Chief Collection on the Switch 2.
2614774	2621540	Could you not, with this thing, have something that's kind of like a controller and keyboard mouse hybrid?
2622478	2623719	That's exactly what they show.
2624020	2627884	Meaning your left hand is... Okay, so that is what they're going for.
2628044	2628784	Interesting.
2628845	2630006	They have it in the picture.
2630126	2632148	That's exactly what they're showing.
2632328	2640837	It's like one hand would be holding the throwback to the Nunchuck, or in this case, the left Joy-Con, and then the other one would be...
2641938	2666877	so then it just clicked for me it's these it's these shooter games we usually think of as you know keyboard mouse and like your overwatches would be a huge one or marvel rivals whatever the fuck you're playing you know though it's those types of games too where it's like oh i don't play those on uh switch because i don't like to play games with controller well now you have a choice and that's something that playstation and xbox even don't have
2667597	2669039	That would be very interesting.
2669600	2677630	S2100Matt says, Oh yeah, that's a safe bet, S2100Matt.
2677690	2684158	I would say a lot of these games that are still ongoing are hugely safe bets for the Switch 2.
2685299	2691124	But as we all know, these games that are already a year old can't carry the Switch 2 forever.
2691725	2697130	I mean, things like Diablo 4, No Man's Sky is out on everything, right?
2697190	2698091	It'll be out on Switch 2.
2699692	2706518	Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, Genshin Impact, all those types of games...
2707699	2734823	Fortnite, Roblox they'll all be out on Switch dead by daylight even though that's not really a well I guess it could be a I guess that could be a very interesting game with this sort of setup the keyboard mouse controller hybrid so yeah I think all of those games absolutely happen on the Switch too absolutely it's just a matter of how fast so yeah
2735478	2735699	Yeah.
2736360	2740809	Yeah, Mike Def says, remember when Genshin Impact got announced for the Switch and never came out?
2740949	2742733	I actually did not realize it never came out.
2742813	2744096	I just assumed it was on the Switch.
2746803	2750265	Well, maybe it has something to do with the power of the Switch.
2750345	2752027	Maybe it will be less of an issue on Switch 2.
2752867	2764756	I would assume there will be a few games like that that never quite made it to Switch, but hit that PlayStation 4, Xbox One level that we will see on Switch 2 because just having the additional oomph behind it.
2765496	2765876	We'll see.
2767278	2772541	Civilization 7 is a big game that's scheduled to come out this week, but a lot of people are already getting their hands on it.
2788169	2789370	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2807304	2808545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2830157	2831498	I understand, it's confusing.
2832518	2836399	So anyway, but some of the fan reaction, not great.
2837900	2846783	You know, and this is the other problem with early access, is that when these reviews come in from fans, with all the problems, it can affect the release.
2846823	2848764	No, I mean, let's look at it this way.
2848844	2853046	If you're greedy enough to offer these early access things for cost...
2854026	2858228	Maybe you should make sure that your game is up to snuff when it comes out.
2858248	2861530	It's only hurting yourself because of your bad decisions.
2861630	2865371	It's even giving me pause, and I love Civ, but I'm sitting here going, hmm.
2865432	2870514	Is this a situation where we're only listening to the negative and not looking for any positive?
2870734	2871795	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2891138	2896520	Bad Navigation, how a lot of information is conveyed in the game.
2897040	2902522	And some of the numerical counters look really basic as fuck and all this, like it looks just kind of like half-baked and stuff.
2902963	2906064	And maybe it's just, it seems very messy.
2906624	2916388	So of course, Reddit has now compiled a bunch of things that people are bitching about, meaning city icons blocking unit icons, menus full of empty space.
2917048	2922825	that's because they know there's DLC later they're gonna fill in that space with which is a whole other issue um
2924212	2926894	People just saying the UI in Civ 6 is better.
2928195	2943185	Now, but to DarkSakura's point, when you go to Metacritic and some of the more people that get paid to do reviews or whatever you want to call it, I believe the score last I looked on Metacritic was 81, which is not a particularly bad score.
2943285	2947288	It's not an oh my god kind of score, but it's definitely not a bad score.
2947308	2948088	That's a green light.
2948108	2948268	I don't
2951210	2952031	8 out of 10 games
2981630	2995740	Civilization comes with DLC later down the turnpike and I will admit it's giving me pause for do I need to get this game right now or should I just wait for the inevitable in three years there'll be the game of the year edition that has all the DLC built into it
2996400	2997781	What's the time to mod?
2997821	2998522	Mod is going to mod.
3020100	3030704	Now, do remember this game exists on PlayStation and Xbox as well, and almost certainly Switch too, where it's going to be a lot harder for the modding to happen.
3031144	3036306	But yes, if you're a PC gamer for Civ, of course, modders are going to fix this.
3036566	3040287	It's just this game hasn't even released yet, and I'm sure the modders are on it.
3040627	3041468	Give it a little time.
3042108	3042288	So...
3043618	3043798	Yeah.
3043818	3045279	I know it's going to happen, though.
3045299	3045939	Of course it is.
3045959	3046460	Of course it is.
3047540	3050662	SSJ100Matt in chat says, the Civ community memes have been funny.
3051323	3054304	Part of me wants to see what they do after the first big update.
3054605	3056045	Then maybe I'll wait until the summer.
3057806	3061729	Bonds006 in chat says, oh, looking at Steam Deck.
3061849	3063150	I thought you were talking about Civ.
3063470	3065131	Actually, talking about other topics.
3065591	3070174	But I have heard some people have said Civ 7 seems to run pretty good on the Steam Deck.
3070734	3075695	Which, I mean, it's supposed to be also working on current consoles, which, you know, the Steam Deck.
3076376	3080937	I'm not too surprised to hear that, that it works pretty well on the Steam Deck and probably makes a good case for that.
3081317	3087759	But again, if the UI has itty-bitty numbers trying to convey some information, that probably doesn't read very well on a Steam Deck.
3088839	3089359	So I don't know.
3089839	3091180	I don't know where I stand on Civ.
3091240	3096221	I kind of went from like, oh, day one purchase, I have to buy it because it's Civ, to like, eh.
3098032	3101256	Let me see what more of my friends have to say on this.
3102177	3102558	We'll see.
3103018	3110288	I mean, you could also see if any early access people that you know would just let you play.
3110889	3111650	That's a good point, too.
3111670	3115295	And then you could try it before you buy.
3115822	3121649	Yeah, I make a lot of decisions with Twitch, too, just watching people that I know play games where it's not filtered.
3121709	3122751	It's like the real game.
3123572	3134785	Admittedly, I haven't had a lot of time this weekend to watch Civ streams, but I will probably do that, if not this evening, a little bit tomorrow, and just kind of see where people are at with it and what...
3136287	3137187	What they're thinking about it.
3138088	3148576	I would hate to see a Civ game flop, but at the same time, if the business of video games is ruining the video game, then maybe it needs to.
3149156	3157202	And when I hear about empty space in menus that seems almost certain for DLC and things that are rushed and all this stuff, then I don't know.
3158123	3162406	The good news is Civilization 1, which is still my favorite.
3162526	3163507	I don't care if it's old.
3163567	3164828	Civ 1 is still my favorite.
3166564	3167664	They can't take that away.
3167884	3170065	That game's never going to go away.
3171125	3173086	So, there you go.
3173866	3175707	Well, I don't know.
3175807	3184909	I just, I don't care to support something, though, that is knowingly released incomplete.
3185049	3185829	Yeah, oh, for sure.
3186050	3186410	I get it.
3186690	3187030	I get it.
3187570	3189450	But we're forced into it time after time.
3190971	3194532	And then people are like, why are video games underperforming?
3196411	3196971	Siv-Rev Siv-Rev
3223493	3226956	SivSav is getting a VR port pretty soon.
3227357	3245314	It is going to be exclusive to the Meta headsets, but Meta 2K and Firaxis Games did announce that this game will be available on the MetaQuest 3 and 3S this spring, and you will be able to freely switch between virtual and mixed reality as you want to.
3245894	3246415	In a quote,
3246895	3253699	In virtual reality, players are transported to an ornate museum as they look out onto a vista personalized to their leader.
3254239	3259282	In mixed reality, the command table adapts to its placement in a player's physical space.
3259882	3268307	Detailed dioramas can be viewed in the archives, a room in your museum dedicated to your gameplay achievements displayed in both virtual and mixed reality.
3269292	3276702	I don't see what any of that has to do with the game, but it's the ooh pretty, which I guess works for VR a lot of the time.
3277242	3277403	So...
3278709	3283252	Anyway, Civ 7, of course, comes out for everybody on February 11th.
3283612	3296241	We do not know the exact release date or price of the meta version of the game, but you can wish list it on the store if you want right now, because of course they're going to take your money the day after the press release comes out.
3296741	3300704	I am curious about, and I see folks in chat saying, I do want to try it.
3300764	3302285	I'm curious to see it in action.
3302885	3308029	I'm curious, like I am no fan of meta right now, but from the concept of,
3308789	3327531	justify VR and gaming outside of Beat Saber from that perspective I'm curious what they come up with but I don't see myself running out and buying a meta quest I can confidently say I do not see that in my future I am never giving meta any money
3328783	3329944	I don't see why I would either.
3330764	3339529	I hope that Valve doesn't walk away from the five, that maybe there's another one of those in the future, but again, there's just not a lot.
3339569	3341850	Maybe we'll see a Vision Pro release.
3341970	3344452	There's not a lot happening in the gaming space.
3345312	3346533	I mean, there's a lot more...
3347433	3360488	headset developers or hardware manufacturers other than Meta and Valve when it comes to that stuff so I wouldn't worry that there's not going to be any headsets out there there's like there's a lot from a lot of companies we don't even hear about all the time but
3362248	3386065	once again modders to the rescue anything exclusive to meta they'll open it up to everything else if there's one thing the modding, hacking, cracking and all those communities they do not like it's that exclusive shit so they'll crack it to run on other platforms it may not run well because the Vive is a few years old at this point but you know these other headset companies that Loki's talking about perhaps
3387529	3389229	Alright, moving on.
3389290	3395211	DarkSakura with an interesting reminder on something I think a lot of people forgot about, quite frankly.
3396091	3399532	Yeah, the SAG AfterStrike is, you know, still ongoing.
3400433	3402313	Don't forget about our voice actors.
3403954	3411516	So, Destiny 2 Heresy, of course, has already launched and instead of...
3413076	3431216	Having, you know, like scab voices, I guess, or anything like that, they've just left those voice sections blank for certain lines and are making up for it with subtitles that are enabled by default so that when you come to a scene, you're not missing on the narrative.
3431697	3432838	It's just not voiced.
3434685	3459030	so um and you can uh as they're saying you can alter size color background uh show speaker's name and do a lot more um to make it easier to understand um you know mostly for uh visual accessibility and they have a bunch of other accessibility uh features in there but this was the big one in in uh
3460150	3481589	uh regards to the strike um the exception being those who signed uh agreements with SAG-AFTRA um that enabled them to continue work yeah which uh Bungie I believe what beat with their partnership with Sony and everything um would not not have an exception so um
3482000	3490492	and Activision though did confirm it recast characters for Black Ops 6 after the strike.
3491273	3492115	Interesting.
3493658	3498082	So, I mean, which is, just for the record, is bad.
3499203	3504447	But I do appreciate that Bungie, I feel like, made the right call here.
3504487	3507910	Although, obviously, the right call would be to give the voice actors what they want.
3508290	3513394	There's a lot of companies, and AI protection specifically, you know, being part of that.
3515015	3522741	I realize this is multiple companies have to come to the table with this, but I will say I appreciate that Bungie did not go the step of using
3523502	3532787	You know, Fiverr hired voice actors to fill in the gap that they did make it a point to be intentionally unvoiced.
3533127	3538090	I think that is the right move from the developer's standpoint and the most they can do during this strike.
3539591	3540291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3557082	3578812	and I still don't hear an end in sight and it's AI protections is what they're so I again I appreciate that the devs didn't use shitty AI they didn't use you know these these other you know Fiverr hired voice actors and things like that they left it blank which is I think the right thing to do to keep the game moving I guess when the strike is bigger than this one particular studio um
3580960	3593825	I'm also going to just say right now that I am not going to ever permit my voice being used without my knowledge for any sort of AI training tool.
3594346	3596526	I will say this right here, right now.
3596647	3597707	I do not consent.
3599575	3610531	and even if it was that I had been licensed to do something in the past or my voice being on the podcast was just out there
3611818	3613018	I don't consent to that.
3613238	3616779	It's not any term of anything that I'm doing.
3616979	3629743	I haven't signed any agreements that permit this or given anyone the ability to recreate my voice and the fact that these companies feel entitled to do so is absolutely disgusting.
3630703	3656212	100% and we are this particular show is self hosted and owned thanks to a extremely generous person who makes it all happen it is not a part of any like libsyn or not that I'm saying these companies practice that but I'm just saying there is no other company that hosts this show that could sign an agreement like that that we would be subject to so we are completely independent in that nature so the only people that can give that permission is us
3656812	3658813	Nobody can speak on behalf of us.
3659153	3662194	I guess Jason could technically give that permission, but he's not going to.
3662594	3665716	So that's where that stands.
3667656	3669777	Yes, and of course we stand with voice actors.
3669797	3671778	They deserve the AI protections.
3672858	3676940	No one can do it actually anyway because we still haven't signed any kind of agreement.
3677480	3679061	So no one can.
3681325	3684607	Yeah, of course we stand with the voice actors and the AI thing.
3684727	3688350	It's such an easy thing that ought to be resolved.
3688670	3692433	You don't use AI on people's voices without their consent, period.
3692593	3693113	Or their art.
3693613	3694054	That's it.
3695775	3698537	Yeah, well, in the case of a voice actor, the voice is art.
3698957	3699417	So yeah, 100%.
3700678	3701819	I'm saying in general.
3702079	3702939	Of course.
3703019	3703860	It's across the board.
3704500	3715246	Do not use any generative AI without the consent of those who are training it or hire a batch to train your AI and pay those people for their skills.
3715799	3721804	Although I will admit, I do see some humor, a limited amount of humor, in that, what was that?
3721944	3725207	There was a Chinese AI thing that caught wildfire recently.
3725227	3727269	It was like a huge app on the store and all this stuff.
3727649	3728330	DeepSeek.
3728470	3729771	Backset, thank you, DeepSeek.
3730252	3736877	And the people at OpenAI complained that DeepSeek stole the learning methodology from OpenAI.
3736958	3741742	And it's one of those things where it's like, do you know who I do not feel bad for in this moment?
3741762	3741802	No.
3743235	3743738	Any of them.
3743879	3745870	Do you know who I do not feel bad for right now?
3751492	3752513	None of it should be stolen.
3753493	3761256	But if an individual like James Earl Jones and his estate wants to allow that, that is different.
3761636	3762456	He is consented.
3762956	3763256	Fine.
3763836	3764197	Fair enough.
3764497	3771479	But then you also look at, say, Troy Baker doing Indiana Jones now, which Harrison Ford is still alive.
3771539	3772279	He could have done it.
3772540	3776201	Obviously, it would have cost – so to save on cost.
3776241	3776661	Interesting.
3777409	3805112	I don't think so either and so you know Troy Baker did but Harrison Ford has said basically that Troy Baker did a fine job he made some interesting comments where it was kind of like I think he was trying to say if they wanted to take my soul they've already done it like they said like type of thing but I don't think that was a dig on Troy Baker I think that was a dig on the series is gonna go on with or without him one way or another and I kind of took it to be like at least they did this and not AI like they were gonna do it one way or another.
3806650	3810852	There's no one in this universe as grumpy as Harrison Ford, okay?
3812312	3813573	Get off my damn plane.
3813673	3814753	What was it he said in Air Force One?
3814773	3815314	Something like that.
3815334	3815574	Anyway.
3816034	3816314	All right.
3818335	3820176	He is a grumpopotamus, but we love him.
3820836	3821156	All right.
3822637	3823117	Moving on.
3823177	3823437	Loki.
3825464	3832209	Alright, so we've got some news about no delays, and we love no delays.
3832609	3837392	So originally, Grand Theft Auto 6 was supposed to be, well, I mean, it's been moved a few times.
3837872	3839393	Now we're in 2025, and the initial, you know,
3844972	3848594	Estimate when is the fall of 2025.
3848954	3858037	But now we have a brand new investor call that has now confirmed that, yes, they are still targeting 2025 for now.
3859698	3862239	It says, look, there's always a risk of slippage.
3862559	3866501	And I think as soon as you say a word like absolutely, you jinx things.
3867441	3868982	So we feel really good about it.
3870083	3875665	I think the game is equally anticipated both internally and externally.
3875845	3877546	We know Rockstar seeks perfection.
3877666	3880327	I would never claim success before it occurs.
3880807	3885669	I'm very fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of the continued success.
3886549	3892051	So if we are running scared and looking all over our shoulders, we know that our competition is on sleep.
3892111	3894232	Our whole organization is super excited.
3894952	3923271	but yes so right now it's that they are not delaying it but that's not to say that there could not be any more delays so we'll just have to wait and see we will have to delay the announcement of a delay because at this time we do not forecast a delay but I'm not saying there won't be a delay our delay is delayed exactly our delay is just not today and our response to the delay being delayed is delayed so
3924602	3926123	We're going to wait a little bit on that delay.
3928464	3929744	Anyway.
3931845	3934346	Better delayed than cancelled.
3935187	3939969	Better delayed than cancelled, which is what happened to the Nintendo PlayStation.
3940029	3949653	Yes, as I'm sure many of you recall, that originally the PlayStation was going to be Sony's first add-on for the Super Nintendo.
3950493	3953755	Thank you, Ken Kutaragi, for coming up with the concept.
3955282	3969407	Well, Shuhei Yoshida, of course, who worked for Sony for a very, very long time, but recently retired, has been opening up a little bit in some interviews about his experience with this failed Nintendo partnership in the Nintendo PlayStation.
3970368	3979331	So he went on some YouTube channel or something that he, the MinMax, I think was the name of the channel, and
3979971	3981771	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4009056	4010157	It was like a shooter.
4010798	4016663	Do you remember on the Sega CD system, there's an amazing game from Game Arts, a space shooter.
4017063	4018144	He's talking about Silphid.
4019325	4023568	And all the assets are streamed from the CD, so lots of assets coming in.
4024289	4026211	I don't remember who made it.
4026811	4028553	It could have been developed in the US or Japan.
4028593	4031515	I wouldn't be surprised if it was actually in Sony's archive.
4031856	4038321	So he's kind of giving you some insight as to what that CD was doing for the Super Nintendo at the time.
4038401	4042625	But as we all know, it didn't end up happening and PlayStation became its own thing.
4043125	4044727	Here we are all these years later on the PS5.
4045287	4048448	There is so much more drama in that.
4049008	4049428	Cliff notes.
4049568	4054289	The arrangement, though, between Sony and Nintendo would have fucked over Nintendo.
4055590	4056150	Bad.
4056950	4060191	And then Nintendo's like, we're just going to go talk to Philips then.
4061531	4064312	And Sony's like, fuck you talking to Philips.
4064392	4066073	We're going to do our own thing then.
4066673	4069313	And Nintendo's like, well, fuck CDs all together.
4072045	4073306	We're gonna do a cartridge!
4074327	4077750	And everyone's looking at them like, the fuck you doing?
4078390	4080512	And that's the drama.
4081093	4084796	You should really have a YouTube channel where this is how you explain video game drama.
4087378	4088459	And I even got a name for you.
4088479	4091281	It's gonna be called... Breaking it down for a bitch.
4094243	4097026	I was gonna call it The Gaming Tea.
4097688	4113076	or you could, yeah, you could throw like some gaming lingo in there, breaking it down for a bite I don't know, anyway, alright, fine I know, just be like it's just gonna be called, fuck you the story of fuckery in the gaming industry it's all fuckery, I don't know
4114198	4117361	There was also a lot of stubbornness thrown in there too And I don't know if it's just me
4143035	4143335	DarkSakura.com
4172114	4182524	Yeah, so, you know, there's the series of games called The Resistance and a lot of people were pretty fond of it.
4183524	4185506	DarkSakura, I'm going to jump in.
4185546	4189169	DarkSakura, I think you actually have something on the Grammys.
4189430	4190250	I picked the wrong one?
4190751	4191011	Yeah.
4191732	4192072	Do I?
4192773	4192953	Yeah.
4192973	4193754	Oh God, I do.
4193814	4194294	I'm sorry.
4194394	4194895	No worries.
4195815	4196436	I don't know why.
4196496	4197237	Live things happen.
4198240	4199361	Why do things not work?
4201142	4201422	Great.
4201582	4202682	And now I don't know where it is.
4202702	4203523	Because life is hard.
4204083	4204703	Ugh, fuck.
4205664	4206904	No, everything is hard.
4206945	4209466	And now it's like, do you want cookies?
4210386	4213708	I want the cookies I can put in my mouth and eat when I'm depressed.
4214328	4215529	Which is all the time.
4216569	4219891	I don't care about... No, just let me read the fucking thing.
4220552	4221052	Okay, hi.
4222072	4223313	Okay, so.
4223973	4224454	Wizardry.
4224974	4225474	How about that?
4225674	4226094	Is that better?
4226234	4226735	Yes, much.
4228727	4255779	so the composer for Wizardry Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord won a Grammy yay won in the best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media category which was introduced about two years ago the other nominees were Pinar Toprak for Avatar Frontiers of Pandora which has a fucking amazing soundtrack for the record
4256691	4271287	Bear McCreary for God of War Ragnarok Valhalla, John Pisano for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Wilbur Droger 2 for Star Wars Outlaws but Phillip says that she was blown away by the win
4272105	4274689	Yay!
4274809	4276871	She also just looks so pleased.
4277933	4278934	She does look very pleased.
4281357	4286224	That's not just like the, oh yeah, I'm a professional and I won the Grammy.
4286264	4288106	She's like, holy shit, I won the Grammy!
4288307	4289388	Well, to be fair, I wouldn't
4289528	4293111	I would consider that Wizardry Proving Grounds was really an underdog.
4293151	4294932	And I'm not talking of the scores.
4294972	4296073	I'm just talking of the games.
4296453	4303458	When you put all these games side by side, Wizardry Proving Grounds really kind of looks like an underdog because it's a remaster of a really old game.
4303899	4305220	It's one of Digital Eclipse's
4305560	4307562	It's very green and has a cloak That's not perfect for wizardry
4332213	4333794	Assassin's Creed 3 and God of War
4360192	4362676	and she wrote a book called A Composer's Guide to Game Music.
4363217	4363718	That's cool.
4364339	4367384	That's very inspirational for people maybe getting into gaming music.
4368045	4368246	Neat.
4369448	4371511	Alright, well Loki, what do you have for us?
4374535	4376916	Let's talk about what could have been is being muted.
4377296	4381759	What could have been with Resistance 4.
4381939	4384740	I was a huge fan of the Resistance series on the PlayStation.
4384780	4387721	It was one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 3.
4388342	4391503	And actually, at the time, I was kind of comparing that between that and Halo 3.
4391783	4396305	And I actually preferred that a lot better because it reminded me of the early...
4397806	4398907	Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3
4416802	4442668	and they said it was a wonderful concept and just in terms of timing and marketing opportunity it just didn't work and the reason for that is that they were going to go back into the backstory of the Chimeria and what their origins were and that type of stuff but the game itself sounded too similar to The Last of Us and they didn't want those two games overlapping and of course as you know The Last of Us was a runaway success game
4443607	4470636	later on so it makes sense that they didn't want to compete with that at the time but they did had they had set up Resistance 3 to essentially end the chapter of the Resistance franchise but leave it open for another game in the future if they were going to go ahead with more Resistance titles but unfortunately they haven't yet which is too bad because I really do like the Resistance games and I really do think it should come back
4470916	4473738	Yeah, I remember you were a big fan of those years ago.
4473798	4475699	And that series did just kind of fall off.
4475799	4477240	So I never realized.
4477600	4483644	Yeah, I guess that makes sense that if it's too similar to another game that Sony's really behind, they wanted to distance that.
4483684	4484224	But that's sad.
4485685	4490949	I can't imagine, though, how that would have been similar to The Last of Us.
4491049	4495291	I mean, if we're talking more of a stealthy game, that's just a totally different game at that point.
4495892	4497053	But I don't know.
4497313	4497433	Hmm.
4498666	4500310	I guess we'll never get to see.
4500651	4501614	We'll never get to see.
4501654	4505504	Unless there was a prototype or something, but it sounds like it didn't even make it that far.
4507728	4512952	All right, well, some games on Steam, especially in early access, never seem to make it far at all.
4513072	4519957	And that's why there is a new warning on early access games that are considered dead.
4520557	4531465	So if you go to an early access game on Steam and then you end up downloading it and then you kind of find out, oh, wait a minute, this game is not only kind of broken, it hasn't been updated in months.
4532265	4537510	So what Valve did to the Steam store was they added something new, which is a warning.
4537950	4545377	So a warning will show up on early access games that will tell you how long it's been since the game was last updated.
4546037	4552603	So this warning will appear in what is the big blue early access box that you're used to seeing with early access games.
4553264	4553344	Um,
4553664	4558186	It will have statements from the game's developer about why the game is in early access, which is normal.
4558246	4558906	That's what it has.
4559367	4568470	But it will also have in orange, it will say how many months or years it's been since the last update went live.
4570811	4578895	It also says in quotes in a disclaimer, the information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date.
4580771	4582631	Project Zomboid has been cited as an example.
4607017	4612980	It is targeting games that were abandoned, such as Unsung Story is a big one.
4613280	4614321	There was a Kickstarter.
4614761	4618423	It was supposed to be a successor to Final Fantasy Tactics, and it never got done.
4618803	4621664	And so now it has a label that says it's been abandoned for four years.
4622145	4625566	So now you can make an informed decision if you want to back that kind of thing or not.
4625706	4628508	So interesting.
4628848	4631489	I think that's good information to have on the Steam store.
4631529	4632550	I think it's a good way to...
4633410	4634150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4656084	4657625	It just gets a magical little upgrade.
4657665	4660628	So I do want to shout that out and congratulate YYR on getting that released.
4661008	4662309	It must feel very, very good.
4663030	4664471	So super duper multitasking.
4665411	4665832	Check it out.
4666072	4667073	Support our friend YYR.
4667093	4668274	All right.
4669855	4673498	We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no early access.
4673578	4676100	Okay, there was no early access to ruin games.
4677121	4678662	We're going to roll the bumper right now.
4689457	4696743	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4697203	4700025	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4700606	4711174	Alright, but once a month, DarkSakura likes to flip the script a little bit and this year she is taking a classic game or a console game that became an arcade game.
4711234	4715237	So DarkSakura, what is the classic console to arcade game of the week?
4717399	4718560	Versus Super Mario Brothers.
4720117	4727472	which is why I was like no spoilers last month my bad what's the first one that came to mind but there's a reason for that
4728991	4730272	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4731053	4733855	So yeah, Versus Super Mario Bros.
4734015	4738878	came out in 1986 as an arcade adaptation of Super Mario Bros.
4738958	4741940	that came out on the NES in 1985.
4742981	4751207	And it was released on the Nintendo's Versus system and the Nintendo Versus Unis system and the variant of that, Nintendo Versus Dual system.
4751668	4752888	We may talk about those someday.
4754049	4764794	The levels were made more difficult, given narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, fewer hidden power-ups, and 200 coins needed for an extra life instead of 100.
4766194	4769096	This was a quarter muncher, y'all.
4770016	4776299	And some of the new levels that were in it were actually featured in the original Super Mario Bros.
4776319	4779860	2, the Japanese version, not the Doki Doki Panic.
4780941	4781041	Um...
4782111	4786535	The arcade version was not actually officially released in Japan.
4787055	4794061	There were coin-op versions that was made from a Famicom console that was placed in an arcade cabinet in Japanese arcades.
4794762	4796263	That was by January 86.
4797604	4801267	And Nintendo, of course, threatened the litigious path
4802568	4820583	and um so but yeah that that kept going in through 87 so outside of Japan versus Super Mario Brothers did officially get released um in early 1986 and it became the first version of the game to get a wide international release
4821863	4828286	It debuted at the 86 Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London.
4829427	4831728	And it was the first appearance of Super Mario Bros.
4831848	4832208	in Europe.
4833189	4838711	So it went on to be pretty popular.
4838731	4840352	It was such a wide release.
4840452	4845675	There was a ROM software conversion kit was how it originally released.
4846335	4873473	it was featured in a contest from the ACME convention in Chicago in March 86 and yeah, basically it became pretty popular and it was the 8th top grossing arcade video game on the US PlayMeter charts in May 86 sold 20,000 arcade units within a few months and became the best selling Nintendo Versus system release
4874654	4887795	basically each unit was averaging more than $200 a week and the 13th highest grossing arcade game in 86 in the US according to replay arcades charts the top of that by the way was Sega's Hang-On
4888393	4888753	DarkSakura,
4908349	4934985	I like this quote it's from Chris Kohler of Kotatsu he said that the game's difficulty was the meanest trick Nintendo ever played um but yeah I mean and it was I think a lot of us this was a lot of people's introduction I think to the Nintendo versus system um which you know I will eventually have to cover that at some point you know like different arcade systems but um
4936926	4939727	There were all sorts.
4939827	4945369	It actually kind of started with Data East having a concept of convertible arcade board systems.
4947029	4951611	And then Sega put out the converted game system.
4951751	4955032	And so this eventually led up to it.
4955192	4961674	It was an idea that they had worked on following the video game crash in 83.
4961714	4961834	And so...
4963655	4967498	That was one of the things that led up to this arcade conversion.
4967698	4969100	So there you go.
4971802	4972242	All right.
4973303	4974264	I'm actually shocked.
4974564	4978608	You talked about how they have the conversion on the Nintendo Switch that Hamster did.
4979108	4982651	And that game is consistently in the top sellers.
4982911	4987655	I legitimately think so many people think that versus...
4988456	5010767	well no I think they they're they're misinformed because they think versus Super Mario Brothers or they go oh it was the arcade version it's the same thing or they go oh it's Super Mario Brothers let's get that and they don't realize like the pain that they are about to suffer because this game was truly much harder horribly painful yeah yeah this this game was was torture
5011627	5012067	to play.
5012608	5014709	I mean, fun, yes, but torture.
5015769	5018971	And it was intended to be a quarter muncher.
5020332	5022213	If you see one in public, don't touch it.
5023974	5033739	Maybe touch it and say thank you for your service, but don't play it because you'll lose on 1-1 and then you'll feel really sad about your life and your choices.
5033859	5038862	Just pay $5 for the hamster one on Switch because that way your quarter loss is limited.
5038882	5039222	Yeah.
5040023	5048163	you'll save money you'll save money, exactly of course the true factor, you save the money you never spend
5049722	5051023	True, true.
5051043	5055046	You know, having played this game... This said from a consumer whore.
5055826	5074859	Having played this game a little bit at the roller rink when I was younger, because I remember the pay choice and all that, and this game was in it, and obviously I never got very far and all that, I'm very curious about that part where you're talking about the Japanese Mario 2, or Lost Levels, if you will, that those levels exist in this game.
5075179	5076520	I was never really aware of that.
5076540	5078321	I'm kind of curious which ones they put in.
5079542	5102590	took too much money to even get there nobody's seen it they've spent all the money trying to get there if I'm correct I'm sure it's some of the like the weight level platform levels you know where they're the scales yeah yeah I think a couple of those were included and yeah the game is vicious interesting oh my gosh
5104097	5107358	I gotta be honest, kind of want to play it.
5107398	5109059	Again, like through a fresh set of eyes.
5109699	5113580	I'm pretty sure I bought it on Switch, but I didn't get very far because of course I didn't.
5114701	5116822	So, interesting.
5117702	5121923	There were some interesting versus games.
5121983	5129046	I mean, they had Tetris and Dr. Mario and Mahjong Wrecking Crew, Ladies Golf.
5130506	5144811	Clu Clu Land, Excitebike There's just a bunch Yeah, I remember versus Excitebike, that was a huge one So, alright Yeah, versus Castlevania was another one Oh, that's right, third party games started showing up at some point
5145748	5154777	Top Gun, Platoon That's so funny that versus Castlevania was one when Vampire Hunter's right there which already had a reputation for being hard as fuck.
5155158	5155738	Or no, no, I'm sorry.
5156079	5156880	I'm sorry.
5156960	5157680	Haunted Castle.
5157781	5159482	I don't know why I called it something else.
5159522	5160784	Haunted Castle was right there.
5161792	5164554	But even Valkyrie Noboken was on there.
5167036	5169999	Valkyrie didn't say it was Legend of the Valkyrie, but it was the Namco one.
5171560	5176584	Super Xavius, Atari RBI Baseball, Sky Kid, Goonies.
5177705	5179567	Well, Goonies was Nintendo, but still.
5180067	5180748	That's why...
5181656	5201301	we never got that's why when we got Goonies 2 we didn't get a Goonies 1 because Goonies was arcade Goonies 1 was considered the arcade game here yeah so yes uh which I believe was board by board it wasn't like the open worldness of Goonies 2 if I remember right yeah yeah
5202284	5207347	Okay, anyways, a few more stories for you, and then we'll see if maybe we have some Lister Roundtable tonight.
5207427	5207747	I don't know.
5207807	5211469	We have a few less people around tonight just because of everything going on in pop culture.
5212329	5212770	But we'll see.
5212830	5214731	We'll offer an opportunity here in a little bit.
5214771	5220474	For now, we have a few more headlines for you that we're going to talk about rapidly in a section called Rapid Fire News.
5220634	5220834	Loki.
5221840	5246585	yeah uh so football manager 25 has been canceled after how dare you bring up football tonight how dare just kidding it's been well it's been canceled there will be no okay oh there will be no football today yes no football as of right now as of the year 2025 it will be unmanaged football from here on no more football rogue football only rogue football if there's the
5248624	5249905	Who's to say what's going to happen?
5249945	5251845	I mean, we're just off the rails here now.
5252326	5260009	But anyways, the developer explained that they were aiming for a high quality game when they announced it.
5260349	5267632	I guess this was come out in March, but they said that they have encountered challenges that made it unable to reach its goal.
5269412	5273654	And also it was rushing too much and in danger of compromising its usual standards.
5274154	5277696	So in other words, they couldn't get a game polished enough.
5279261	5281322	Well, maybe.
5281702	5289485	I mean, I don't know what Football Manager's standards are, but, I mean, you've got to have high standards if you're managing the football.
5290246	5291926	All of the football, so.
5293207	5298029	The football, you know, let's not confuse this.
5299029	5303231	But yes, so there will not be a Football Manager 25, but fret not!
5305629	5311471	for It Will Rise Again in 2026 with Football Manager 26.
5312311	5312931	Oh, joy.
5313831	5318953	Certainly not 25, but just developed longer with 26 on it.
5319613	5322914	We'll just throw that in the pile of things that are fucked in 2025.
5323174	5325975	Good job, football.
5327075	5329296	You're going to just have to manage football on 2024, last year's management.
5333294	5357025	sorry you just have to remember better times you gotta cut back, you gotta play those old sports games you don't need to play every new release back in my day, we had no football manager football managers, yeah it was unmanaged it was all unmanaged chaos it was football chaos, that's it
5360320	5386463	and then we've got news that Magic the Gathering is going to be adopted for TV and movies cool that's all I have to say about that I don't know cool hey, we're the first to bring magic to the movies there has not been magic in movies yet until now
5387478	5388239	Same with TV.
5388359	5389380	No magic in TV.
5389520	5394264	We are groundbreaking as far as bringing magic to cinema.
5394284	5396746	Cinema has been unmagical up until this point.
5398968	5399849	I'm going to say this.
5400129	5405714	The Magic of the Gathering universe is pretty lore heavy and has a lot going on.
5405854	5408957	Even back when I was selling my Black Borders off.
5410358	5411940	So I'm kind of surprised.
5411980	5413401	I mean, there's been comics forever.
5416620	5417901	I don't know what this is going to be.
5417961	5418922	It'll be something that cashes.
5419022	5422044	It'll be like a Dungeons and Dragons movie that cashes in on this stuff.
5422565	5423806	And you know what?
5424226	5431872	Maybe it'll be decent because as much as it's easy to sit here and poke fun of it, a lot of recent video game adaptations have been fine.
5432293	5433594	Not all of them have been good.
5433714	5436336	Like the Resident Evil Netflix was a choice.
5436416	5440819	But there's been some decent video game adaptations that have happened.
5440839	5441920	A lot of them recently.
5442060	5442861	So we'll see.
5443902	5444442	Magic the Gathering
5463917	5465717	God, I wish I still had mine somewhere.
5465837	5468138	I bet that thing's worth a lot of fucking money now.
5468238	5473399	We used to use the candelabra and all that stuff to get the ginormous cards into our decks.
5473499	5475019	That's so funny.
5475039	5475719	So we could play them.
5477219	5482260	SS2100 Matt in chat says, hopefully they have enough colorless mana in play to make this a good movie.
5487341	5488161	Thanks, Dad.
5488181	5492202	This movie funded by the sale of three Mox Jets.
5492904	5497209	Well, if this is modern Hollywood, you can better believe it's going to be colorless mana.
5499452	5500954	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5503356	5508843	Oh, and extra cost will be covered by a couple of dual lands and a Legends deck.
5509524	5509884	There you go.
5510605	5510905	Anyway...
5513231	5516194	Well, this is something actually that Dan and I are pretty excited about.
5516214	5517716	We're going to get it.
5517976	5529107	Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is going to be released for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on May 16th.
5529487	5530408	Capcom has said so.
5530488	5531529	You can order it now.
5532630	5532730	Um...
5534032	5557744	and it will have for the pre-order I hate using that word the collection will unlock rearranged versions of Soy Sauce for Geese and the Rival Schools Medley and you can listen to it in the Endgame Museum and of course there are a limited number of physical copies that will have Capcom vs. SNK original comics
5558764	5574097	um but it's going to include Capcom vs. SNK Millennium Fight 2000 Pro Capcom vs. SNK 2 Mark of the Millennium 2001 Capcom Fighting Evolution Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper Project Justice yes
5575118	5601030	Powerstone, Powerstone 2, Plasma Sword, Nightmare of Bilstein You will have online play, you have a training bag mode, a customizable one at that Expanded language support, you have a full museum built in, a customizable experience Different EX settings and display filters and button layouts and blah
5601950	5624914	um you have mid-game saves and uh different balance adjustments and quality of life adjustments for the game so yay yeah I'm excited for this too I'm definitely gonna pick this up yes good stuff all right and then uh we have woke me up to tell me about this it's important
5627027	5633252	It's clearly very important to the well-being of our lives and our continued marriage.
5634293	5640017	Well, also things that are important to music game fans would be the newest things that Harmonix is up to.
5640618	5645722	And Harmonix, of course, is a part of Epic Games now, which makes Fortnite.
5646122	5651266	And so Harmonix and Look North World have released what's called Patchwork Parkour.
5651967	5654789	It's a rhythm game now available in Fortnite.
5655169	5659414	So it is a single player obstacle course that is available in Fortnite.
5659454	5661216	It's an original EDM soundtrack.
5661796	5665741	It kind of has immersive isometric view and it also has side scrolling mechanics to it.
5666241	5669985	And they're saying that this was built in the Unreal editor for Fortnite.
5670686	5673910	It was built in Patchwork, which is a suite of...
5675471	5683117	and Unreal Editor for Fortnite development tools that will allow creators to build dynamic music and visual experiences.
5684058	5686499	So they actually built the soundtrack within the tool.
5686920	5692584	It adjusts the music as you go through four phases in this world and navigate more challenging terrain.
5693024	5694125	So it looks interesting.
5694145	5695126	I'm going to have to try that.
5695226	5696747	So you can check it out in Fortnite.
5696787	5698789	You do have to use a code to get it.
5699449	5702052	Get your pen and paper real fast or your rewind button.
5702532	5702993	It's 1-425-4464-4801.
5703113	5712142	But I imagine if you log into Fortnite, it's got to be one of the featured worlds right now.
5712182	5716586	It's probably not too difficult to find, but you can use the rewind button if you need that number again.
5716867	5723113	Or thanks to us searching, if you look for Patchwork Parkour, you'll probably find that number pretty easy.
5724326	5729099	Alright, well in the meantime, let's travel around and check out some release dates around the world.
5729720	5730743	We'll start in the US.

5993809	5996892	I'm sure Civ 7 is a big one, but you heard about some others out there as well.
5997352	6001735	We love to hear from you throughout the week in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com.
6002015	6005017	We're also on BlueSky at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
6005097	6008880	Yes, you can have a custom.com as your BlueSky name, and that's really the way to do it.
6009580	6010500	to prove it's really you.
6011501	6013642	And you can also email us anytime.
6013702	6015842	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
6016303	6019524	We'll get to all those interactions in just a little bit.
6019584	6021845	But first, I think Loki has one more story for us.
6022865	6023125	Yep.
6023345	6030608	So the release date for Melgar's Solid Delta Snake Eater has accidentally been announced.
6030868	6031088	Oops.
6032131	6039276	Sony accidentally uploaded the trailer that contained the release date to the front page.
6040176	6041397	Oops.
6041537	6044499	And that's why they had to take the whole goddamn thing down for a day.
6044839	6045680	No, no, no.
6046020	6047121	Delete, delete, delete.
6050643	6056307	I love that whatever game is playing behind you right now just had fire show up right as you are talking about that.
6056347	6057247	It's really funny.
6057467	6057908	Oh, yeah.
6059228	6059789	Twisted Metal.
6060109	6061330	Yeah.
6061775	6080650	Yeah, that's how I imagine that the whole thing went down, is essentially, yeah, there was a fire and they had to, you know, throw water on the server to stop the release date getting leaked out, but it's too late because someone saw it, so now it's out there forever.
6081771	6085274	So, not that I really care, but what's the date?
6086795	6089497	So, the release date is August 28th.
6089577	6090198	Oh my god!
6093290	6094291	Just in time for Labor Day.
6095833	6096093	Yeah.
6096554	6097895	I won't be here to buy it anyway.
6099116	6104201	And then for some reason in the trailer, though, it also had an ape escape monkey slapping its butt.
6104281	6106583	So I'm not sure what that has to do with anything.
6106984	6111508	Maybe there's a capturing ape escape monkeys mode.
6111568	6112369	Counterpoint.
6112449	6114031	Maybe we need that in more trailers.
6116483	6117044	We do.
6117664	6121868	Maybe it's a tie-in for the movie The Monkey.
6122448	6126631	We need the Last of Us Part 3 trailer to hit because we know that's going to happen eventually.
6126651	6128653	We just need that really super emotional moment.
6129033	6130655	Last of Us Part 3, the high stakes.
6130735	6132056	Oh my god, this is so emotional.
6132076	6132777	I'm going to cry.
6133057	6133937	This is so messed up.
6133998	6134858	And then, bam!
6134958	6136680	Butt slap right at the end.
6137320	6138081	Coming soon!
6138241	6138942	Boing, boing, boing, boing.
6141886	6145968	I don't know why you just made me think of that character from Toshinden on Saturn.
6147329	6147829	Not on Saturn.
6147889	6149690	It was, was it Toshinden 3, I think?
6149750	6150370	The butt monkey.
6151530	6151911	We don't know.
6151951	6152631	I don't remember his name.
6152911	6156013	We always called him the butt monkey because he would attack with his butt.
6156313	6158594	So Dark Tetsuya has a serious answer here.
6158714	6159414	Boo.
6159514	6160054	No, I'm just kidding.
6160074	6161375	We appreciate it.
6162516	6166677	Again, what is up with you all fucking wanting facts on your video game podcast?
6166737	6167538	I don't understand.
6169431	6173672	Seriously, I just came here for a good time and I feel so affected right now.
6173692	6175212	There you go.
6175252	6177712	See, now it makes sense and I don't like it.
6177732	6178113	Of course.
6178153	6179713	I have to rewind a little bit.
6179773	6184874	So, Snake Eater was technically Metal Gear Solid 3 before, right?
6184894	6185034	Mm-hmm.
6199915	6201035	So why isn't it Gamma?
6201075	6201855	Why is it Delta?
6206837	6210297	Now you're asking for more logic, and we've already given you enough tonight.
6210978	6212458	Because they tie- Go away.
6212898	6219180	Product placement tie-in with Delta Airlines, and so now, that's how they're gonna make the money back.
6219500	6220980	Fly the friendly skies!
6221100	6221780	Boing, oing, oing, oing.
6223501	6223841	Alright.
6224381	6227121	Well, no, Rob, it's Snake Eater, not Snake Beater.
6227782	6229382	Although, either could be interchangeable.
6253792	6279228	uh vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room if you'd like to call us tonight we also are happy to take comments from our chat uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network I don't think we had anything on blue sky tonight I will double check I also don't think we had anything in the mailbag either but I sometimes get that wrong no no no we don't how dare next week people
6281025	6298631	I need at least 10 emails about how you love me or at least give me money send us some good photoshops of the ape escape monkey in your favorite video game but not 10 of them listener photoshop challenge if your video game is ape escape no
6302822	6304484	We are not going to break down.
6304504	6305284	Oh, that's true.
6305604	6309768	Remember, if we don't get email or calls, we talk about Drag Race.
6309788	6316273	SSJ100, Matt reminds us, we get to do gay shit if we don't get any emails or whatever.
6316553	6318255	Well, I don't really watch Drag Race anymore.
6318295	6320436	I'm stupid, and I did buy the season of Drag Race.
6320797	6321257	Oh, did you?
6321477	6322558	I don't really watch.
6322678	6323199	I did see.
6323239	6325501	I will say, okay, so when I was in Portland...
6326361	6327882	It was a butthole.
6356278	6357698	I've been watching Fashion Photo Review
6382603	6389685	One of the queens within a week of that did that number in Portland, like with that, but actually did like a full reveal.
6389745	6393966	So they took the thing off and there was a whole outfit underneath it and it was really well done.
6394486	6395947	I thought, yeah, it was a fun performance.
6396867	6406850	And then the other thing I learned is that there is a Badlands in Portland and it is the exact same fucking thing right down to what happens each night as the Sacramento one.
6408755	6409956	Except it's laid out differently.
6409996	6410877	There's two.
6410917	6412077	Yeah, I just thought that was interesting.
6412117	6412618	I was like, wow.
6412658	6414099	Isn't there another Badlands?
6414179	6414839	In San Francisco.
6415260	6419102	And I think Reno is supposed to be getting one if they don't already have one.
6419483	6421144	But where's our Hamburger Mary's?
6421224	6423766	It's the McDonald's of gay bars at this point.
6424686	6425047	It is.
6425127	6425627	But it's fine.
6425647	6426788	But at least it's not Faces.
6426888	6428649	Yeah.
6430290	6459277	SG-100 Matt did specifically call out the new Gaga song which I will say is really fucking good it is really fucking good so like yeah that's all there is to say about it if not listen to you know I love ABBA but of course I love ABBA Cadabra you need to go listen to that song it's it's great I'm sure I'm sure I say you need to go listen to that song I'm sure it has been forced upon all of you at some week if you have a gay person in your life this song has been forced upon you at some point this week and I would say it's
6459577	6461919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6482515	6484036	Y'all stopped shitting on Chromatica.
6485337	6489660	Chromatica gave us the Chromatica 2 to 9-1-1 transition.
6489680	6490741	It was incredible.
6490901	6491562	Did y'all forget?
6492002	6492763	Y'all have amnesia?
6493223	6499007	It did come out during COVID, so maybe the answer is yes to those questions.
6499568	6499768	But...
6500348	6507138	Or maybe it's just because she has been gone a few years, you know, doing the acting thing, doing the whole, I'm going to be in the Joker movie.
6507198	6507919	And guess what?
6508059	6508760	It's a stinker.
6510163	6514649	That whole stuff, you know, so it's, I would say she's back to form with music.
6515610	6537260	um but she didn't exactly go any it's not like Chromatica was a bad album it's a great album that that duet with Elton John it's like one of my favorite Gaga songs so fucking good even if I fucking love Elton John even if the end turns into um dubstep for no reason uh I love that song you know what though I want you know what you don't know what I want an acoustic album
6538379	6538939	Oh, from Gaga?
6539520	6542963	Well, there's the Tony Bennett albums are very close to that.
6542983	6543163	No, no, no.
6543183	6546946	I want like Oh, her songs instead of jazz standards.
6547046	6547926	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6548287	6551249	Done like piano or acoustic guitar or something.
6551309	6553170	I want like a Gaga unplugged.
6553211	6559035	Yeah, because when she plays things like Poker Face and Paparazzi on the piano, it's so good.
6559055	6559696	Yeah.
6560696	6566758	That's also why Gaga legitimately plays all these instruments, writes all her music.
6567178	6569839	And we all know a lot of the pop girlies don't do that.
6569919	6571700	And I'm not here to pit women against each other.
6572120	6574100	Yeah, they hire Kesha to do it for them.
6574340	6581803	But part of the reason that Gaga is on this different plane is because she's the full package.
6581823	6582863	Yeah.
6584215	6586317	And she's getting people involved politically, which is a great thing.
6586437	6592442	And as much as I kind of don't give a hoot about the Grammys, I guess they're trying to work on some of their issues.
6592522	6599467	The Weeknd forgave them, so I don't have time to watch it, but I'm looking with curiosity what's going on.
6599507	6602630	And obviously I saw what Gaga said, which was very necessary.
6602690	6604711	And that's another reason why we fucking love her.
6605012	6608735	That's why LGBTQIA, all your rainbow fans,
6609215	6610415	I was very happy to hear that
6630788	6632509	Let's see.
6632589	6633269	I guess that's it.
6633789	6640472	We didn't get a lot of other stuff tonight, but that's because, again, I think a lot of folks are distracted by pop culture things.
6640672	6641612	I hope you had fun.
6641872	6644593	I hope your team sports the way you wanted them to.
6644953	6646854	But I will say, I'm just going to be honest.
6647574	6648335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6661874	6666056	When Dan woke me up this morning, I mean, he basically woke me up to say it was noon.
6667116	6669578	He was like, I hope both teams lose.
6669658	6672219	And I'm like, yeah, grumpy cat law.
6674440	6675900	But I'm going to say one thing.
6676721	6680543	The team that the turd was going for lost.
6682043	6683324	And I'm happy about that.
6683344	6684744	I didn't know he gave a shit.
6684764	6685765	But anyway, I don't give a shit.
6685785	6686585	Oh, he's salty.
6686805	6687806	Bitch is salty.
6688777	6694926	And Bitch is also salty that Time gave the cover to his little Stoogey instead of him.
6695427	6699132	OrangeRiteInChat says, we flipped a coin to see what team we should cheer for.
6699693	6701836	I just say I'm glad it didn't land on heads.
6702256	6703979	I already have my joke for next week.
6704059	6706501	I already have my joke, because you know I'm hosting some shows next week.
6706521	6709363	If you're here in Sacramento, check out what's going on at the Colonial Theater Friday and Saturday.
6709383	6721313	We've got Rocky Horror on Saturday, and we have my Bloody Valentine, Gorlesque performance on Friday, variety show featuring Sigourney Beaver, my favorite drag name ever, from Dragula Season 4 is going to be there.
6722193	6723054	on Friday.
6723154	6724255	And I already have one of my jokes.
6724315	6725135	I'm going to spoil it for you.
6725175	6725435	You ready?
6725455	6728597	I'm going to say, how many of y'all were watching the Super Bowl last week?
6728657	6729358	Yep.
6729478	6732239	I don't think people really gave a shit about either of those teams.
6732279	6732680	Let me see.
6733020	6734661	Clap if you're rooting for the Eagles.
6735421	6736762	And I expect it will be dead silence.
6737082	6739183	Clap if you're rooting for the team from Kansas City.
6739924	6741065	And I expect it's going to be silent.
6741085	6744467	I'm going to say, clap if you're rooting for the asteroid to kill us all in 2032.
6744547	6744607	Woo!
6744647	6744747	See?
6744767	6745027	That's...
6748709	6750070	That's what you're going to have to look forward to.
6750190	6753873	More Aubrey Plaza inspired jokes.
6755695	6760018	The real winner was Serena dancing to a diss track about her ex.
6760498	6761039	That's the winner.
6765402	6766003	Who's Serena?
6767182	6795403	Serena Williams oh the tennis player okay well I'm like there could be a lot of Serenas out there in the world like one of my best friends in grade school is named Serena and I was like oh she's a football fan Serena Woods okay okay yeah dancing in front of everyone to a diss track about her ex that's oh Anne Hathaway was there I do like her and people booing at Taylor Swift
6797731	6800673	I don't know why they were booing at her, but they were, and I'm confused.
6800693	6803174	I feel like it's trendy to hate her.
6803995	6807077	I mean, I don't like listening to her.
6807237	6810679	I am far from being a Swifty, but I'm not like a hater.
6811160	6824989	Yeah, I would actually go so far as to say I'm actually very impressed at she took back those albums that were basically stolen by her label and sold against her will, and she said, you know what, fuck this, and she's taking them back and re-recording them.
6825289	6826070	I think that's a really
6826890	6827151	All right.
6827171	6828652	Well, with that.
6828672	6829493	Oh, I guess last minute stories.
6829513	6830033	Loki, video games?
6851785	6852446	Yeah, okay, alright.
6853128	6853930	Enough.
6854030	6854431	Enough.
6855193	6855554	You know what?
6855995	6860325	Football Manager isn't happening anymore and we're all mourning, so isn't that enough?
6860466	6860786	Alright.
6862341	6884736	that means we're doing final thoughts and we're going to wrap it up tonight DarkSakura, not streaming tonight unfortunately I'm not I walked around way too much yesterday and my leg hurts I'm actually on rest for another two weeks so I'm all I'm taking some time tonight I'm just kinda yeah
6888406	6889407	Alright, fair enough.
6889508	6889988	Rest up.
6890449	6892932	When your body says no, I don't like to overdo it either.
6893012	6894614	That's why I haven't been streaming a lot lately.
6894654	6897637	I'm just like, I have to be mentally in the right place to do it.
6897878	6898538	It doesn't happen.
6898959	6899299	It's fair.
6899339	6902002	I'm sending you a suggestion real quick.
6905134	6905334	Okay.
6906155	6911178	Well, meantime, let's go to Loki and get your final thought tonight.
6911778	6912038	Oh, wait.
6912098	6913619	I didn't really get your final thought, Jamie.
6913659	6914060	I'm sorry.
6914280	6916021	I just said why you're not streaming.
6916081	6917001	I have no thoughts.
6918302	6919643	There are no thoughts, only Zul.
6921144	6921624	Fair enough.
6922945	6924446	Loki, what are your final thoughts?
6925366	6931911	Like I told my football team that I manage, unfortunately, you're on your own from now on.
6931971	6932511	Do your best.
6935751	6936271	Resist.
6936592	6937292	I agree with Matt.
6937332	6937752	Resist.
6940454	6941475	My final thought.
6944096	6945157	I love Gabby Windy.
6945517	6947979	I don't expect that any of you know who this woman is.
6948239	6952562	And I would not blame you because the first – no, Gabby Windy, I'm going to tell you.
6952582	6953262	You need to look her up.
6953342	6954303	I fucking love her.
6954663	6958366	I've discovered her through TikTok and the television show The Traitors, which you all know I love.
6958446	6959746	I love my trashy reality shows.
6960147	6960767	And here's the thing.
6960847	6961528	Gabby Windy –
6962583	6964965	Rose, her first show was The Bachelorette.
6965085	6967126	And I really don't give a shit about that show.
6967186	6968527	I'm just going to be straight up honest.
6969027	6973610	But the way she was introduced on The Traitors, she's like a young Jennifer Coolidge.
6973971	6975692	She talks just like her.
6975832	6980315	She's very, so somebody asked Gabby Windy, like, oh, what are you known for?
6980355	6981336	Like, what show are you from?
6981356	6983417	And she goes, I was on The Bachelor, Bachelorette.
6983817	6986999	And they go, you know, oh, well, how was that experience for you?
6987019	6989021	And she goes, well, I'm a lesbian now.
6989061	6990262	So that should tell you how that went.
6990282	6990642	Yeah.
6991773	7000034	and that's very much her sense of humor and now I get her TikToks all the time and like I got a TikTok of her yesterday going
7000851	7003753	You're going to go to a meeting at 3 p.m.?
7004093	7005054	How dare you?
7005454	7006674	I just had lunch.
7007135	7008436	I'm processing.
7009396	7011137	No, I don't want to get on a FaceTime.
7011397	7014359	The fuck I want to get on a FaceTime to talk about solutions.
7014759	7017061	Send me the fucking Google Slides.
7017621	7022584	I need you all to look Gabby Wendy up because that is the energy I need all of us to bring in 2025.
7023144	7028327	I've decided I fucking love this woman and I stan her very hard and she's the best thing to come out of that TV show.
7028367	7029288	You'll have to send me a link.
7029608	7030389	I will, I will.
7030489	7032990	I love her so much.
7033370	7035071	I just learned today she has a podcast.
7037012	7038473	Fuck, what is the podcast called?
7038513	7038893	Hold on.
7038953	7041735	Yes, I'm going to do something I've never done.
7042815	7044376	Is it Gavin with Gabby?
7044936	7046437	Yes, I think it is Gavin with Gabby.
7046457	7046717	No, wait.
7046757	7049579	No, I just made that up.
7050259	7051900	Long-winded with Gabby Windy.
7052440	7053841	That's the name of it.
7054021	7058744	I have never, ever plugged a non-indie podcast on this program.
7060239	7078493	so um the latest episode was called chiropractic pervert the episode before that was called after a lesbian breakup with whatever friends and then the episode before that was called I burnt my clitoris I'm down
7079868	7080309	Love her.
7080629	7081469	I love her.
7081750	7082090	Okay.
7082590	7082931	Anyway.
7083811	7087114	And the traitors, excellent reality television.
7087414	7087734	Excellent.
7087854	7090696	I call it the Super Smash Brothers of reality game shows.
7091077	7099583	That is exactly what it is because it takes people from Survivor, Big Brother, and then reality shows that aren't even really game shows.
7099663	7101525	It's like, what the fuck is this person doing here?
7101925	7105728	But the Real Housewives, and it's fantastic.
7106108	7106709	Fantastic.
7107608	7108248	Yeah, right?
7108748	7111949	Gabby Windy is the only reason I'm getting up in the morning lately.
7113110	7114770	That's going to get us through the next four years.
7114890	7115151	All right.
7115651	7117891	On that note, have a wonderful night, everybody.
7118011	7119012	We'll see you next time.
7120252	7120612	Good night.
