9600	13102	Ubisoft sure paints a rosy picture for a company that appears to be getting into financial trouble.
13222	17444	Despite a one-third downturn in finances, pre-sales for the next Assassin's Creed are tracking solidly.
17584	23106	Previews have been positive, Rainbow Six Siege has had resilient performance, and the crew at Motorfest is doing better than its predecessor.
23226	27428	Also, they're ahead of schedule in cutting costs, and discipline will see them through the rough waters.
27849	29309	This is the Shareholder Value Headline.
29469	34432	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about Ubisoft's numbers and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34712	36733	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
38956	41978	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42018	46361	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46501	48603	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
48623	54967	We are live once again with episode number 1036 of our show for tonight, February the 16th of 2025.
57389	59190	Happy Valentine's Day weekend.
59250	61510	Happy chocolates on discount weekend.
61590	63051	Happy President's Day weekend.
63091	65031	Whatever it is you're celebrating this weekend.
65111	66232	Hope it is going great.
66312	68272	And thanks for spending some time with us.
68832	72473	My name is Rob Roberts here with you every week as well as my co-hosts.
72673	74574	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
76408	78209	Wait, Gavin Newsom?
78249	78710	I'm just kidding.
78730	79110	Kidding!
79330	79571	Kidding!
101345	101925	Alright, anyway.
102505	105346	But remember City Hall, how that whole thing started?
105406	105926	Alright, forget it.
105986	106246	Anyway.
106706	107407	No, it was great.
107527	108027	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
108167	110047	But I mean, I'm like, you know what?
110687	111308	I'm over it.
111648	120450	But Dan and I did our thing where we drank wine and ate spinach dip and French bread.
120870	122650	We did not watch UHF this year.
122890	124751	We ended up watching anime intros.
125735	129758	Some of our listeners may not know the story about UHF and why that's important for you and Dan.
130719	141406	So when we first got together after I moved out here in January, about a few weeks later, we got engaged on Valentine's Day.
141947	148972	And we were on that day eating French bread and spinach dip and drinking Menashevitz Blackberry Wine.
150664	152125	and we were watching UHF.
152385	155106	And then we got married seven years later.
155326	161349	And 10 years after that, we met Weird Al backstage at a meet and greet for the mandatory fun truck.
161369	162590	That's right, I remember that, yeah.
163170	167772	And Al signed our copy of UHF and said, I'm sorry, you're still together?
169253	170814	He thought it was cute.
171074	171474	I love it.
171534	172715	That's a very Al thing to do.
172755	173595	He was such a sweet guy.
173775	174375	I love it.
175416	177437	And then three years after that, I got a theater of magic.
177457	178397	Oh, Weirdo Alan.
178657	179418	Oh, Weirdo Alan.
181178	183496	I got a computer of magic three years later.
185261	187863	Happy 13th on it, which we bought from a co-worker.
213683	216567	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
230626	232787	So there's always a show Valentine's Day weekend.
233048	237730	And the local company that puts this on tends to pair it up.
237970	241913	If they're going to rent the theater anyway, they might as well do a Friday show and a Saturday show.
242253	247096	So they did like a burlesque, drag, variety, comedy, all that on Friday night.
247416	251458	We had Sigourney Beaver from Dragula there, my favorite drag name ever, Sigourney Beaver.
252459	253059	And she's great.
253139	255841	I love her because she's like half drag, half burlesque.
256261	258822	She's really nice too.
258882	260983	Some people in that industry have a little bit of ego.
261223	264244	In the reality TV front, you get all sorts of mix of people.
264344	266705	Some people kind of have the delusions of grandeur thing going on.
267045	269866	But I'm happy to say Sigourney is great.
270606	276768	I can always tell the sign of humility when the talent like that doesn't want their own dressing room.
277008	280930	They want to get ready in the same room as all the other performers to get to know them.
281390	283631	And I'm always like, yeah, that's a real sign.
283651	283891	That's
284491	288233	That's somebody that like is down to earth and you want to work with and doesn't forget their roots.
288514	289294	So love that.
289434	290835	Love that about her and everything.
292496	298920	But this has been the thing for like the last, you know, outside of the COVID years, probably the last eight years at least.
299321	304084	So Alan and I are pretty used to not really actually doing anything on Valentine's Day, but...
304844	305525	Starboard Power Coupling
325521	327963	and most every year, you know, obviously COVID fucked things up.
328363	329624	So this will be our fourth cruise.
330105	333607	So yeah, so Alan and I go on a cruise instead.
333887	342633	We booked a very, we booked an extra dollar dinner to do something very, very fancy while we're out there in the middle of the ocean on our way to East Mexico.
343194	345135	So yeah, really excited for icebergs.
345495	346656	Yeah.
347097	348257	In the Caribbean.
348277	351019	Well, climate change is real.
351139	351780	You never know.
352300	353501	I mean, climate change is
353581	354702	We'll see you next time.
369508	370468	What was I going to say about that?
370509	376431	Oh yeah, a reminder to all of you, because I'm gone and we won't be here for three weeks.
376832	380793	So this is our last show until March 9th.
381954	384415	It's our very first actual hiatus.
385876	388657	Well, I've left for three weeks before.
388677	392139	An actual hiatus.
392479	393339	An actual hiatus.
393800	394580	Shay's still here.
394660	396501	Shay's playing Dead by Daylight, Brad.
398214	398655	Let's see.
398815	402397	Phil of Nine in chat says, did you hear about the Star Trek experience at Universal Studios?
402437	404639	I want to go.
404759	406841	It's different, but yes, I want to go.
409603	413926	I still haven't been to fucking Mario Land at Universal.
414006	414646	I really want to go.
414906	416167	Let's just go.
416207	417148	You know who lives down there?
417228	420650	Arya Snark or Lady Victoria is right there at Universal.
420730	421271	I know we should.
421371	421911	We really should.
422291	422712	Road trip.
424039	425120	I just saw Rainbow Lemur
441909	443891	Yeah, no, Avowed's getting real good reviews, though.
445412	448494	I refuse to pay for the early access, but I hope to jump in.
448935	450856	It's out officially on, what, the 18th or something like that?
451357	451917	Maybe tomorrow.
451937	453759	It's probably a Game Pass, I think.
454439	457162	I picked it up on PC, though, too.
457202	463267	Doesn't it only come out, like, oh, maybe it's Game Pass on the 18th, and if you buy it now, you have it.
463787	465989	That's, yeah, I'm waiting for the Game Pass release.
466289	467970	Well, it's the early access, or...
470888	486783	early access it's like early edition essentially $20 more and you get it like you could play it now it's like oh so that's that's the shit I won't do yeah so uh I only did it for Diablo 4 and even then I'm like why did I do that but I had time how dirty did you feel about that
486783	487543	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
508348	516849	But anyway, Loki, I was going to ask you, since DarkSakura was talking a little bit about the engagement story, remind me how you and Nelly got engaged, Mrs. Loki.
518308	519388	How we got engaged?
520008	521449	I think I just asked her.
522209	523930	That's kind of what happened with Alan and I, to be fair.
526110	531432	After Trump won the election the first time, we were like, well, I'm sorry, but this is how it happened.
531792	534012	We were like, all right.
534072	536273	We better get married before we can't.
536593	537013	So we did.
537713	540174	And that's why we didn't have a big old ceremony or anything.
541277	542898	But Loki had a nice ceremony.
543038	543518	I was in it.
543618	544099	It was cute.
544739	545479	Yeah, it was good.
545519	558987	Yeah, we went to some retirement community's golf course and they had a nice thing there where we got married out and they're like, I don't know what it is.
559007	561048	But you could tell they were used to weddings.
561148	563390	It was very much like a wedding, a pleasant wedding venue.
563470	563710	Yeah.
564030	565031	It was a fun way.
565091	567092	I remember your DJ having problems.
567745	568546	Yes, he's an idiot.
568726	570888	But other than that, it was all right.
570908	576272	Because originally, like, so, like, you know, here's the best DJ ever.
578595	583640	We gave him a CD with the music that we wanted to use.
584200	592448	Nelly is Jewish, and so she wanted to walk down to Sunrise Sunset.
592488	593889	We thought that would be cute.
596892	598614	Instead of that, he played...
600745	601265	Not the SWB!
624100	634268	Hey, we don't want you to play the chicken dance or any of those corny ass... The cha-cha slide, I swear to God.
634288	635629	I swear to God.
636450	639152	I'm jumping out a window the next time I hear that fucking song.
639172	640693	He did all of them.
640773	642555	He was the worst.
642895	647458	And then after all that, he's like, so would you recommend me?
649560	651642	I would recommend you find a new job.
653974	656856	Recommend you quit drugs.
656976	658297	It was one of those guys.
658377	659417	We found him, I think.
659778	663700	I would recommend Microsoft OneNote and keep some notes on your clients.
664981	667482	Yeah, there was like, I don't know why we went with him.
667583	669003	We should have went with my uncle.
669083	671745	He's also a DJ and like he would have been an idiot.
671865	673786	So like, I don't know, but whatever.
674607	675327	It's fine.
675507	677128	It's something we can look back and laugh at.
677329	677689	It's just...
679961	684766	Oh yeah, and he keeps calling me by the wrong name when he's addressing me too.
684966	685847	He's just a moron.
685927	686988	He's like an idiot.
687408	688469	How hard is your job?
688549	689170	Not really.
689710	691472	I mean, it's not that hard.
691812	692313	You play CDs.
692453	692493	Um...
696463	697223	Oh my gosh.
698084	699384	Well, you know what, though?
699985	705507	It doesn't matter the quality of the reception because y'all are still married all these years later.
705687	707788	So, you know, it worked out in the end.
708028	709809	And marriage is more important than the wedding.
709869	710329	That's right.
711969	716151	I mean, the wedding, we were just tired and we went to a bed and breakfast for like a few days.
717792	718152	That's right.
719112	721173	We went to the courthouse and didn't have a honeymoon.
721433	722874	We just stayed home and played video games.
723479	733106	Yeah, we just went to the courthouse and we didn't tell anybody until... It actually worked out kind of nice because then on inauguration day, we were able to make the social media posts.
733546	736908	And so it was able to be like, ha, we're taking attention away from what's going on today.
737149	738430	And it was a lovely feeling.
740908	744252	I wish we could have done it again last month, but you know.
745694	750340	Everyone in the country is looking at your social media.
750380	751862	Well, I did joke with Alan.
751902	755146	I said, hey, Alan, do you want to adopt a baby on January 20th?
755467	758550	I said, we have to one-up the news from eight years ago somehow.
760100	763421	But no, we've already decided children are not in our future.
763781	764941	Other people's children, yes.
765122	765902	Our own children, no.
766662	767342	That's the best thing.
767802	769883	You borrow them and give them back when you're done.
770123	776065	Here, put your kid on loan to me for 24 hours and I'm going to give it back, hopefully without damage.
776105	782307	And this is not a society that's kind to bodies with uteri, which is my current plural version of uterus.
782547	782667	Mm-hmm.
784562	788725	Bobby Blackwell does point out, I posted about kittens on Inauguration Day this year.
788845	790346	I did adopt kittens on the 20th.
790667	791607	That would have been a good thing.
792028	793308	That's a really good idea as well.
793348	795410	I don't think we're ready because we know the cruise is looming.
795510	798212	I don't think we're ready to get a new cat.
798252	799753	Obviously, we lost Smush early this year.
799833	805297	So it's been in the back of our minds that, yeah, we want to adopt a Cheddar, a friend, even though Cheddar is very antisocial and doesn't want a friend.
807058	808079	He never mourned, by the way.
808099	809620	Yeah, and she's not going to get a friend.
810756	817302	But when we get back from the cruise, you may hear about a little something-something.
817642	822786	I know the kitten adoption agency or whatever that placed Cheddar with us.
823126	825308	Smush we found through a friend of a friend.
826189	828070	We actually went through an adoption agency for Cheddar.
829652	831893	And they heard about Mr. Smush.
832634	833835	through Instagram or whatever.
833996	838300	And they have definitely been sending Alan, like, look at this cat.
838420	840823	This cat would be a great mix for fixer cheddar.
840923	841924	Isn't this cat lovely?
842265	843946	And I appreciate the work they're trying to do.
844047	847130	They are trying to, you know, they're trying to find homes for these cats and all that stuff.
847190	849232	But, you know, we're like, not yet.
849312	850393	And I'm like, not yet.
850474	853397	You just, you block them until March.
855198	882570	there's an animal group that does TNR and Rehams Fosters all volunteer and they helped me with a kitten that I had rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue and because of them I went to one of the Pet Smarts that they did their adoptions through and that's where I got Midna so I could specifically it's an animal outreach of Diamond Springs and they supplied a lot of them in Citrus Heights and Roseville and what not interesting
883578	884900	They were really, really good people.
885000	891291	They went all out, had people drive down and meet me downtown to take this kitten.
892284	895787	And my car smelled like tuna for a week, but it was fine.
895927	899591	Those cat rescue people do really good work, and they do thorough work.
899771	905216	And if you can afford to do TNR, that's trap, neuter, release, please do.
905817	914184	A lot of times your local humane society will work with you, or there are other vets that provide the service pro bono for spaying and neutering cats.
914765	917948	It is the best thing for a feral cat that if you get them fixed...
918388	924452	Their ears get knocked and they put right back in their community because they cannot be socialized.
925292	928935	Kittens, wait till they're weaned, get them adopted.
929690	930411	That's not always true.
930451	934153	We have one that's got a notched ear that we... That's right.
934393	936395	You had a walk-in cat, right?
937235	938957	Well, that was the cat distribution system.
939017	941158	Yes, that's the cat distribution system.
941198	942479	It's still like on loan.
943340	945021	She comes and goes as she feels like it.
945281	956509	But for the most part, a lot of ferals cannot be socialized and it really is the best for them emotionally and safety-wise for everyone involved to release them back into their communities.
958069	958329	Alright.
958349	959410	Okay, and I'm done.
974378	975779	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1004619	1026450	you know it was just like I was like oh this was coming um so yeah they they announced a bunch of different things during a state of play and showed some upcoming games and demos are available and stuff like that so uh apparently the big reveal was uh Soros a new single player game that builds on I guess Returnal
1029082	1030283	So that looks neat.
1030803	1032824	Borderlands 3 is about to release.
1032924	1037447	That's the thing that's probably getting the most attention is that particular reveal.
1037747	1042450	That's the only thing I've seen where people were like, yes, Returnal, getting a spiritual successor, yay!
1042970	1044811	Which, yeah, it was an early hit on the PlayStation 5.
1044931	1045772	It's pretty good, so...
1047302	1053467	Borderlands 4 is set to release in September, which honestly is a lot sooner than I thought it would be.
1054788	1064676	And they said that Gearbox is going to have a special reveal show or video that they're going to do for that coming out later this spring.
1066278	1072623	And the gameplay at least looks a little bit more like Borderlands, but with a lot more movement flair to it, which...
1074558	1075258	I can see that.
1075418	1075799	I don't know.
1076219	1079420	It still doesn't feel like a Borderlands game to me just yet.
1081240	1087383	Then we've got a brand new city, I guess, action game coming.
1087943	1090824	It's from the former Grand Theft Auto 5 lead.
1091944	1096506	And it looks like Cyberpunk meets Grand Theft Auto, which sign me up for that, please.
1098166	1099347	But without the bugs, please.
1101092	1101793	Yes, yes.
1102093	1108719	And then also we've got Days Gone Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5 with new modes.
1108759	1110000	They have Horde, Permadeath.
1110180	1112923	It's the remaster nobody asked for, literally.
1113744	1116546	All of them are the remasters that nobody asked for.
1116866	1121651	Games that came out on your previous console that you're remastering for.
1123493	1125014	Yeah, whatever it is.
1127034	1127755	Money getting money.
1129636	1136822	Doesn't it feel a little bit like maybe they're trying to inflate the PlayStation 5 release calendar with re-releases?
1137163	1141466	Which, to be fair, Nintendo's done a very similar thing with the Switch and Wii U games.
1141527	1146731	But we all know the Wii U was not the most beloved console by the masses.
1148172	1150474	Niche gamers and Nintendo fans feel differently.
1150714	1153297	I think the caveat there is...
1153857	1181526	you know, with like some of the stuff, like the Wii U stuff coming to the Switch, I cannot physically play the Wii U stuff on the Switch whereas these PlayStation 4 games I can play them on the PlayStation 5 true, true and so it's like, that's what makes it extra unnecessary, it would be different if it was like a PlayStation 3 game or it was a PlayStation 2 game or something that I can literally not play on that console, like if it's a thing I can play on the console already
1184006	1185246	No, I'm sorry.
1185587	1186827	That doesn't work.
1186927	1192889	It would be the same as if there was a Wii remaster on the Wii U or something like that.
1192929	1195249	That would be like, well, I can already play that, though.
1195269	1196450	That doesn't make any sense.
1196830	1203271	I guess it could have been high def at that point, but jumping from 480 to 1080 is a lot more than...
1206610	1228720	you know 4k to 4k but yeah slightly better it's about like oh playstation 5 and playstation 5 pro look at the two screenshots it's like i can't see a difference you know is that what we're counting remaster nowadays i don't know but anyways it's coming consume good consumer enjoy
1230245	1258161	Liza P is DLC is coming this summer sounds like it's going to be like a prequel they said let's see it looks like a director's cut as well Stellar Blades coming to PC which cool PlayStation games come to PC now Sonic Racing Cross Worlds this is an announcement trailer I swear this was already announced
1259082	1262224	I knew that there was a new Sonic racing game coming, so I wanted to see.
1281973	1307763	a lot of chat about how it looks very much like Sonic Racing Transformed Part 2 which probably should have just been the name but that was a really good racer game they're solid games I would definitely check out this game I just hope they don't bring back Danica Patrick because she kind of sucks now maybe it's time to bring back bring in a different meme racer or something we'll bring the guy that yells Sega
1310182	1311911	Bring the guy that scenes the Daytona theme.
1314699	1316500	That should be an unlockable song.
1317280	1321882	Yeah, so I... That game looks neat.
1322343	1322903	I would play that.
1322943	1330747	It's just I hope it doesn't end up getting fucked by Mario Kart 9 coming out at the exact same time.
1331087	1335709	I think the first Transformed was right around Mario Kart 8, so the games can coexist.
1336389	1341932	I feel like it had a lot, but I just... You know if it's out the same time as Mario Kart 9, that's going to really...
1344500	1347362	I know it won't kill it, but it's just unfortunate timing.
1347442	1348103	Unfortunate timing.
1348343	1348523	Yeah.
1349264	1351085	Well, I was going to say, like, I don't know.
1351105	1352065	I didn't watch the trailer.
1352125	1356788	So, you know, if this is what it is, you know, then great.
1356989	1369617	But I would love to see a racing game similar to this where essentially you kind of do the PlayStation All-Stars treatment where you have, like, you know, one game's, like, world versus the other game's world kind of, like,
1370177	1376039	Mixing together in a specific track or stage or something like that.
1376059	1376940	That would be really cool.
1376960	1377740	That would be really cool.
1377820	1379841	Sounds like that would be.
1380081	1382822	With the solid state drive, it could kind of build it on the fly.
1382842	1383983	I think that would be really rad.
1384123	1386644	Or just something where it looks like Yakuza meets...
1389825	1392148	I don't know, Sonic the Hedgehog or something like that.
1392188	1397414	You just like mix some of the stuff together that doesn't really go, but like it could be a cool stage or something.
1397474	1397794	I don't know.
1398055	1398815	Love that.
1399336	1400738	Or like, here's a good one.
1401098	1402660	Crazy Taxi in Daytona.
1402780	1407145	So yeah, like, you know, the Daytona track or Crazy Taxi, you jump onto the Daytona.
1407185	1407445	Yeah.
1409367	1415796	You know, they got the crazy, you know, the taxis just like veered around and stuff like that'd be some pretty cool gameplay there.
1416236	1423606	Anyways, also, we've got a new game that looks like Doom meets Armored Core.
1425228	1425668	Cool.
1426469	1427531	I would like to see that.
1428477	1452903	um looks neat and then uh Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake uh the release date is uh confirmed and then it's going to be coming out in August uh Like a Dragon, Pirate Yakuza is going to be getting a demo uh soon as well as a Dave the Diver crossover that everybody's crossing over that was very random Dave the Diver gets around little harlot
1454406	1456768	We've got Shinobi Art of Vengeance.
1457129	1458310	Oh, that looks really good.
1458450	1459110	That looks really good.
1459150	1460332	That looks really cool.
1460812	1463474	It kind of reminds me of that Ninja Gaiden remake.
1463514	1464315	Yeah, yeah.
1464515	1465917	Or that we've got coming.
1466417	1470501	And then Monster Hunter Wilds has got a first free update.
1471642	1473343	And that is coming out this spring.
1474124	1474384	Nice.
1474404	1475085	I look forward to that.
1476297	1482261	So yeah, some good... I think maybe there were people going into that expecting like, oh, a new Final Fantasy or something.
1482481	1485183	Sometimes people set the bar too high with that shit.
1485583	1486344	Not in February.
1486724	1488525	Not in February.
1488665	1491567	No, wait for summer at least for something like that.
1492028	1494449	And again, manage your expectations.
1494589	1497151	I don't want them to announce a game that's going to be five years out.
1497311	1498492	I don't.
1498632	1505116	I wouldn't mind a teaser of the third Final Fantasy 7 remake, rebirth game though.
1505356	1506037	Give us the title.
1506777	1512618	would be a cute thing to give because I can't imagine it's going to take years and years and years to get that game, especially if they want it to be on PS5.
1512659	1514219	They need to have it done like next year.
1514359	1517280	But, you know, making games is difficult.
1518400	1526582	But I liked I liked how they did Final Fantasy 16, quite honestly, because Final Fantasy 16 was out within two years, a year and a half of its unveiling.
1527022	1531763	I mean, way less of a hype line than Final Fantasy 15 was, that's for sure.
1532503	1533003	So, yeah.
1533703	1533943	All right.
1534624	1535344	Well, let's move on.
1536317	1539038	into the things that we've been hyped about this week in our gaming weeks.
1539098	1540378	And how was your gaming week?
1540458	1541539	Let's go over to DarkSakura.
1541559	1542219	How was your gaming week?
1543539	1544380	It was all right.
1545260	1548841	I'm still hurting quite a bit, so sitting down and playing isn't really easy for me.
1550181	1553682	But I did play some Dead by Daylight, of course.
1554343	1555423	Some Fruit Mountain.
1555583	1559404	I played my third playthrough of Dragon Age The Veilguard.
1560585	1562905	And yeah, that's about it for now.
1563406	1564046	I played some Polya.
1564066	1564766	That was it.
1565475	1565635	Nice.
1566656	1567476	All right, we'll go to Loki.
1568797	1574120	I played some Minecraft and then some more Minecraft and more Minecraft.
1574161	1584447	Now, we mainly this week has been focusing on getting ready for season four, which we just started our season four SMP server yesterday.
1584687	1586348	So we had the kickoff yesterday.
1586368	1592032	I've been playing that quite a bit, as well as just kind of walking people through the
1592472	1611420	World Tour server so we have we've had our season 3 server up for a couple weeks now and people are getting to check out everything, get to ride the rides in my theme park and all that and check out all the other builds so it's been a lot of fun to see people looking through that and then
1613554	1639552	Balotro as well I got to mess around that found out it's incredibly easy to modify since all the code is in Lua you can just open the executable like it is a zip file and just tinker away inside there it's all plain text so have at it so that was fun that didn't get me playing the game for a very long time with modified decks and whatnot so yeah
1640683	1642864	Yeah, that was a fun distraction.
1642884	1645546	And of course, got to get Avowed for next week.
1646407	1651490	Yeah, the reviews on that are really good, and I'm excited to check it out when I get back from the cruise.
1652970	1658874	You know, and then maybe they'll have a post patch that fixes whatever issues people find in the first week, and it'll be in a good state of play.
1658894	1664457	But I kind of heard that Avowed is like Elder Scrolls, but all killer, no filler, which I think is very interesting.
1664758	1666499	Yeah, I want to check it out.
1668581	1669501	Let's see, my gaming week.
1670322	1672445	Mostly Diablo 4, let's be real, y'all know me.
1672585	1674086	I've been working on the current season.
1674126	1675708	I'm still trying to finish out the Battle Pass.
1676148	1684317	Oddly enough, page 5, I think it is on the Battle Pass, is kind of hard because it's a really long grind for some things that only spawn occasionally.
1684777	1712277	or you just have to get like really powerful to up the odds on on some of the seasonal mechanics I won't get too far into it but it's kind of been holding me up but I'm still really enjoying the Barbarian build I'm playing the Leapquake Barbarian they also are having a Lunar New Year event which I think ends on Tuesday so it's almost done but that was another like mini grind for a new mount so I was working on that a little bit but otherwise I'm up Paragon I think about 186 for the season which is pretty considering there's only 300 Paragon levels overall it's pretty good
1712677	1713598	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1735894	1736935	That's Diablo 4.
1737395	1741898	Maybe I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 and still quite a bit of No Man's Sky.
1742079	1744640	Actually, I have been making progress on my No Man's Sky.
1745841	1751005	I want my platinum trophy on PlayStation and I got some more golds this week to get me there.
1751085	1756089	I know I got the gold with Aliens Met, the gold with Languages Learned, the gold with Money.
1756109	1758371	I think I got that on stream early on.
1759031	1762754	So I'm getting some golds and I just need some of the more grindy ones.
1762774	1764335	I think there's one you have to warp like 75 times.
1765816	1769098	which isn't that bad, but you know, you just have to, it's a lot.
1769158	1772400	And then killing pirate ships is another one that's going to take some time too.
1772980	1776562	Um, but I haven't been afraid to take on sentinels and pirate ships.
1776682	1778363	I have a good build to let me do it.
1778443	1780684	So I can play a little more aggressively than I usually play.
1780744	1781305	No man's sky.
1781885	1781965	Uh,
1782145	1788050	All in the name of a stupid platinum trophy, but I want the little merit badge because I love that game so much.
1788651	1791033	And I always talk about it on this program.
1791233	1791934	It's really silly.
1791994	1794516	I don't have the stupid sticker to go with it.
1794536	1797459	The you did it sticker to go with it that the platinum trophy offers.
1798140	1800261	So that's pretty much what I've been playing.
1801348	1805329	Alright, reminder, we will not be here in the next two weeks live.
1806469	1809150	DarkSakura, you'll kind of still be streaming on your own thing though, right?
1809890	1810190	Likely?
1810210	1811990	Yeah, I'm pretty sure that I will.
1813811	1825653	I mean, at the very least, we can do like some just chatting and do some general, you know, like what's going on in the world in the news right now and just have a thing.
1826212	1829514	And Bobby Blackwolf will still be here at VOG Network for the next couple weeks.
1829554	1834376	So if y'all would still turn out and show him some love, that would be much appreciated as well.
1834496	1838918	But yeah, I'm excited to take a little vacation.
1838978	1840038	I hope y'all understand.
1840739	1841279	I want a break.
1841499	1841779	All right.
1843200	1843460	Anyway.
1843960	1844180	All right.
1844220	1847522	Let's get into some more stories with what's going on in the news.
1847722	1849042	Loki, we'll start with you.
1849262	1850583	We talked a lot about PlayStation.
1850623	1851283	It's only fair.
1851724	1852504	What's Xbox doing?
1853973	1857861	So Xbox is saying, well, Phil Spencer is coming out and saying, hey, you know what?
1858282	1860607	You know how Sony's pushing all those live series games?
1862053	1863715	We don't need to do that necessarily.
1864715	1869979	He says he wants to see every game, or he doesn't want to see every game turn into a big live service game.
1870019	1874963	Essentially, they were all games that have a beginning, middle, and an end.
1875584	1884550	It was because I didn't want to see every game turn into some big live service-based game because the developer felt like that's where the business model was.
1884630	1885911	It's not easy to do that.
1886071	1889294	Not every story is told that way, and not every game...
1889894	1892977	or Creative Idea supports that business model.
1893477	1900202	So he's fine with just having linear games or just stuff that doesn't have to go on forever.
1900222	1904165	It's so nice to hear a gaming executive that knows how to read the fucking room.
1904685	1910730	Now, Phil Spencer was not great last year with all the layoffs and everything going on.
1911210	1913392	But I will still give credit where credit is due.
1914172	1915674	And it's nice to hear...
1916995	1918576	I think he has the right perspective on this.
1918856	1926981	Because what I'm hearing is that's the very nice and politically correct way of saying developers need to stop shoving this shit in games where it doesn't need it.
1927101	1931124	Games still can have a beginning, middle, and end and do just fine.
1933706	1937949	Which I think Avowed is probably on track to do based on all the buzz I see online.
1938549	1942152	We'll see when the sales come in, but it sounds like a lot of people are really hyped for this.
1942952	1947455	And I mean, if you look at some games, it doesn't even necessarily that it has to have a beginning, middle and end.
1947655	1952158	It just doesn't need to go on forever, like being supported online because that's expensive to do.
1952679	1959323	I mean, I look at games that like some of the Bethesda games like Fallout, Elder Scrolls, that type of stuff.
1959663	1965887	Those are games that people will go back to time and time again and put hundreds of hours in.
1966007	1966208	Yeah.
1966368	1968569	And that doesn't even need a live service on there.
1968869	1972432	Granted, Bethesda tries to shove that stuff in there with paid mods.
1973052	1996309	just wholly unnecessary and just a cash grab but whatever um and like you know there's Fallout 76 as well you know which uh I think that did not start off with a monthly fee and now it's not but anyways it the whole thing is that it doesn't have to be a live service game but I think that you can have success with live service if you it's done right but
1997834	2025807	most times it's not done right most of the times it doesn't really need to be there so and he also says you know for an example I love the fact we can go look at what Psychon Double Fine is working on I think like a team like Compulsion these aren't big teams and I don't want massive 1000 person teams we want them to be able to do great work and I want to create a platform that can support that and I think he's talking about Game Pass there basically saying that they're allowed to
2026167	2055003	they can spotlight those games and whatnot uh great comment from QuestBuster in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network QuestBuster says if the game is good it will sell like Baldur's Gate 3 great example or more recently uh Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 I good call out on that title because that title was not really on my radar but I've kind of seen the buzz around that I've had friends that have picked that up and have been interested in it apparently it is it's even better than the first game um so yeah it's a good call out on that one too uh
2055143	2076369	and then saying which apparently made back its production budget in a day both games have no live service components no great great yeah I and you know and I think a lot of us were observing you know I like to say I said but a lot of people said Baldur's Gate 3 was going to be a really humbling thing for a lot of the industry and it's going to really I think change the perspective of
2077009	2077449	I agree.
2077469	2077589	Yep.
2102950	2111753	And then, yeah, now Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is also doing pretty well, at least, you know, at expectations, whatever that is.
2112113	2115775	And since it's not Square Enix, we know they are reasonable expectations for that company.
2116295	2126519	Although on a random aside note, did you hear that although Square Enix always says this didn't meet expectations, this didn't meet expectations, apparently the Dragon Quest 3...
2127859	2133396	3 HD 2D Remaster actually exceeded expectations per Square Enix.
2134008	2142994	Right, because their expectations are flawed, and so whoever's making those expectations or setting those expectations is doing a bad job at it.
2143014	2145216	They do not give the retro stuff enough credit.
2145456	2148158	I bet Pixel Remasters exceeded expectations as well.
2148178	2150540	It just took them too goddamn long to multi-platform that.
2151580	2155143	But I think that's a sure guarantee.
2155603	2160407	We're going to see... I mean, we already know Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are supposed to be...
2160987	2162168	We're not already supposed to be out?
2162228	2162948	Did I miss that?
2163048	2166150	I thought 1 and 2 were supposed to get that same treatment pretty quickly.
2166990	2168331	It was supposed to come out later.
2169191	2171493	I thought it was late in the year last year, but I guess not.
2172233	2174414	I would have felt like I would have picked that up if it had happened.
2175255	2176355	It's going to be later-er.
2176795	2177256	Later-er.
2177356	2177996	More later-er.
2178836	2179397	More later-er.
2180097	2200668	yeah so uh you know but again we've been saying this for a while what a perfect engine this you know retro remaking engine that goes back to Octopath Traveler they're all running a very similar thing Chrono Trigger hello everybody wants it it's time do it come on Square
2201826	2202446	Do it, poke, poke, poke.
2202486	2204967	I would even take Final Fantasy 6.
2205687	2206427	They just did 6.
2207107	2208927	They just did the Pixel Remaster.
2209067	2210008	They just did it.
2210208	2211228	Isn't that same engine?
2211808	2213108	No, it's, well, I don't think it is.
2213468	2221890	Well, the opera scene, people are like, so like the opera scene did a completely different thing than everything else the Pixel Remasters did.
2221910	2223310	Well, that's not what I want.
2223930	2227511	But, um... It did not meet my expectations.
2231621	2256503	but maybe what about I'm trying to get like Final Fantasy games that could still get that that haven't I don't Final Fantasy Mystic Quest no it's good I like Mystic Quest but Mystic Quest at this point would be like a $5 side game like it's just not you're not going to be able to convince people to pay for that I would like to see Final Fantasy I would like to see a 3D game turned into a 2D game hmm
2257048	2258688	Like a 7 or 9?
2259389	2262449	Let's do 12, why not?
2264130	2268531	Because they already did 12, they already did 10 How about 11?
2268651	2270691	How about offline 11?
2270951	2282634	I want Final Fantasy 17 and I want it to be in pixel form Which Naoki Yoshida said could happen He said that's up to the next team That's up to the next team
2283627	2286989	If the world is upside down world that we live in, except it's not.
2287610	2304422	Well, in a world where Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations, but Dragon Quest HD, 2D, 3D, XD, LD, LOL for matching service featuring Dreams Come True did, then, you know, anything's possible.
2307144	2307384	Anyway.
2308925	2309986	What else did Phil Spencer say?
2312126	2336884	uh he said a lot of things no he basically aside from you know talking about uh Xbox and how there was you know he wanted the games with the beginning and end and all that stuff he's also uh talking about their release strategy on PlayStation 5 saying I'm not trying to move them all over to uh Xbox anymore uh essentially that you know what you know the
2337907	2341649	Where it makes sense they're going to put stuff on PlayStation.
2343689	2346991	It's maybe not what I was going to say at the time.
2347471	2351692	But yeah, I would like to make money for all the games that we ship right now.
2351933	2356374	Obviously, we make more on our own platform.
2356835	2359336	It's the one reason we invest in our own platform.
2359716	2361576	Or investment in our own platform is important.
2362097	2362777	But there are...
2363277	2364378	and many more.
2384236	2395915	I mean that's just business sense that makes sense like hey why put ourselves why lock ourselves to our own platform if we can publish some of these games on these other platforms like
2397481	2400044	Oh no, is it going to make the console fanboys mad?
2400304	2400985	Who cares?
2401605	2403227	They have to be a profitable company.
2403427	2406671	I'd rather see the games available in other platforms.
2406891	2410334	I mean, all the time we're talking about stuff like Final Fantasy.
2410655	2411415	Perfect example.
2411776	2414138	Hey, I wish it was on a platform that I could play it.
2414158	2415860	I wish it was on Xbox as well.
2416100	2417902	Or I wish it came to PC right away.
2417942	2418222	You know?
2418943	2419103	Um...
2420524	2432451	These console exclusives are kind of silly, but I get it, because you're trying to sell more of your console to then get people to buy stuff through your game shop so that you make your 30% profit off of everything.
2434652	2438354	Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to go multi-platform with some of this stuff.
2438754	2442236	Maybe Nintendo could learn a lesson from that, but I doubt that they will.
2442276	2443277	Don't talk crazy now.
2444797	2445778	That is crazy talk, yeah.
2446799	2447119	Alright.
2447918	2452402	Well, moving on, talking about a series that y'all know I never shut up about.
2452422	2459267	It's Diablo 4, and in shocking news, it has been confirmed that Diablo 4 is not getting an update this year.
2459808	2462730	The next expansion will be in 2026.
2463611	2475561	You might remember that Diablo 4 got a little bit of heat because it released an expansion only a year after its initial release, and that was Vessel of Hatred, which honestly was pretty good, let's be real.
2475641	2476782	Did it kill people with hatred?
2477743	2479164	Um, in a game?
2479624	2482247	No, to contain the hatred in a vessel.
2482467	2489454	But it also ended in a way that just basically screamed, we are not done yet, there is more to come, which of course there is.
2490054	2490935	Who was surprised?
2491175	2493477	Nobody, certainly me at the front of that line.
2494298	2498482	And, you know, I think people were a little...
2499605	2500726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2523405	2524065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2539994	2551142	That at DICE 2025 that the first expansion was actually internally delayed six months because they had to move staffers to bug fixes and ongoing content.
2551182	2555125	They originally wanted annual expansions, but that didn't work out.
2555225	2557467	And that is honestly probably for the best.
2557507	2559188	I think annual expansions would just be...
2560469	2560869	It's a lot.
2560969	2563950	Also, there's a lot to do in the game.
2564010	2564810	I will say this.
2565731	2573593	As much as I sit here and go, annual expansions, I'm like, Vessel of Hatred did add a lot to the game, and there's plenty to do in the endgame loop right now.
2573613	2575553	The endgame's in a really good place in Diablo.
2575853	2576434	So, I...
2578254	2582717	I'm kind of curious what else they're going to do to extend that endgame circle in future expansions.
2582777	2583437	I guess we'll see.
2584718	2587680	But yeah, for now, you get what you get for the next year.
2587820	2600369	And quite frankly, as long as they keep doing the seasonal content that actually do like minor updates with these minor new mechanics, like the whole ongoing season brings in a lot of moves that are inspired by the Witch Doctor from Diablo 3.
2601229	2601810	DarkSakura, what do you have?
2630250	2630850	I think you meant lethargic.
2630870	2631171	Well...
2653932	2658334	Or you haven't played that Gold Master series that Digital Eclipse put out like just a year ago.
2658474	2659395	So that's all about him.
2659415	2660555	I care more about Tempest 2000.
2660896	2661076	Anyway.
2661116	2662096	Which is in that collection.
2662116	2662596	Thank you very much.
2663297	2664017	Yes.
2664778	2672021	Anyway, he also did a remake for an unreleased Atari prototype, Akka-R.
2672461	2673482	So, yay.
2674602	2691568	And now he has his eyes turned to iRobot, which was an arcade game from 1984 and just bringing up the visuals and changing some of the original design, adding in some music, new game modes.
2692108	2693309	It could be fun.
2693989	2700551	I mean, now I also forgot that he did a Nine Inch Nails video.
2701411	2701871	Oh, really?
2702912	2703232	Yeah.
2703432	2703552	Huh.
2704655	2708958	But anyway, it will be released in the spring.
2709018	2710719	Don't really have a date for it right now.
2710779	2716323	It's going to be on the Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.
2717344	2721267	And there is also going to be a port for PlayStation VR 2.
2722725	2724467	That could be interesting, a VR port.
2724707	2725408	Yeah.
2725789	2726529	Very interesting.
2726650	2732136	I feel like a VR port of this would make me sick because there's a lot going on.
2732216	2732496	I don't know.
2732897	2737402	I watched the trailer and there is a lot going on in this trailer.
2737482	2738703	I'm like, this is almost...
2740225	2741827	Too much happening.
2742807	2746331	But I mean, that is also, like a lot of Jeff Minter games are like this.
2746751	2751856	But I'm like, okay, so it's like kind of Amidar, but like with all of this going on.
2752756	2755239	And I'm seriously, flash warning if you're watching live right now.
2755279	2758101	There's just a lot of flash stuff going on here.
2759703	2761304	It looks like a lot visually.
2763366	2765488	I don't know how I would feel about that in VR.
2766028	2766269	But...
2767478	2769179	I guess, you know what's the equivalent of?
2769379	2771680	It's the hot wing challenge for visuals.
2771820	2772660	That's what it is.
2773000	2773581	That's what it is.
2773621	2774501	Okay, the visuals are down.
2775741	2776742	But, anyway.
2780443	2781384	But yeah, Jeff Ventor's cool.
2781704	2784465	So, I'd at least check it out, loud or not.
2785425	2787166	Super Zapper Recharge.
2788407	2789047	Okay.
2789107	2791768	It's funny though, because the original game was pretty much a flop, wasn't it?
2793117	2795640	Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was passed over.
2795661	2801550	It was done by the guy that did Missile Command in the original Tempest, but I don't think people were really into it.
2802050	2802211	No.
2803533	2804394	All right, moving on.
2805336	2807859	Loki, with an update on one of our least favorite companies.
2808942	2817267	Yes, and now our favorite news is the least favorite company is that sales are down, revenues down, it's all down.
2818888	2825652	That's probably because, well, Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed and then delayed and then more delayed.
2826953	2828654	So yes, let's talk about the numbers.
2828694	2828834	So
2829975	2837649	as of uh for the nine months i guess ending at the end of the year they were down 990 million euro uh 31.4 percent over last year
2843358	2852746	Down 944 million for net bookings Digital net bookings, 784 million dollars Down, was it, 33.8% And then they're back in catalog Down 27.7% at 762.3 million euro And, yeah, so, like I said
2870732	2897153	Assassin's Creed Shadows big contributor to that this is not surprising though to them because they were basically revised their expectations of 300 million for the period instead and it's in line with that right now they're saying though that Assassin's Creed Shadows that the pre-orders for the title are tracking solidly
2898788	2927408	early previews have been positive praising it's narrative and immersive experience not what I've seen it says well both characters playing critical roles in the game storyline also not what I've seen as far as reviews go basically all the good gameplay is with the female ninja in there and that the samurai gameplay is crap because it's nothing like Assassin's Creed it's just you know most of the abilities are locked behind her um
2929341	2933663	Yes, and then, of course, you know, then they go to praise the Assassin's Creed team.
2934183	2936744	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2937184	2945287	Also, apparently, they have recorded 36 million monthly active users across consoles and PC, and these are up by 4-7%.
2945327	2945407	Also,
2949924	2954488	that the numbers for the what was it called?
2954688	2956570	The Crew Motor Fest are higher.
2956790	2959192	Yeah, probably because you shut the servers down for the other ones.
2960753	2964776	Rising, I guess, 38% year over year.
2965077	2971182	Also, I think sales too on those titles kind of attributed to that as well.
2973944	2978568	That's a lot of focus on Shadows doing well.
2980305	2981466	I think the last good game they put out was Avatar.
2981486	2982286	That was really good.
3005563	3008125	Some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
3008245	3011908	SJ100Matt says, I want the live service game where Yves sells the company.
3012308	3014730	I'd get the day one edition ultimate season pass of that.
3015631	3016111	Right there with you.
3016831	3020334	Questbuster says, Ubisoft suffered a lot of self-inflicted wounds.
3020774	3022055	Skull and bones flopped.
3022175	3022436	Yep.
3022616	3024057	X-Defiant is shutting down this year.
3024497	3026578	Lost Crown and Outlaws apparently underperformed.
3026698	3030960	A new Division spinoff was cancelled because the company is being led poorly.
3031480	3033361	They're forcing them to do things with these games.
3034242	3040885	It's the exact opposite of what Phil Spencer is saying in that earlier story about not everything needs to be a live story game.
3041585	3045187	It's Yves Gamon the one setting those expectations so high.
3045667	3048308	Oh, it's a triple, it's a quadruple A game.
3048368	3051830	It's worth this $80 price point or whatever and it's like
3053829	3054530	It's crap.
3054690	3066339	It's Rush crap that has fewer features than a game you released many, many years ago that the ship combat and stuff was just a part of the game.
3066379	3067821	It wasn't even the whole game.
3067921	3077548	And, like, how did you screw up a game that you had already kind of nailed, basically saying, hey, just take Assassin's Creed out of it and just make it all the pirate stuff, and then you got a gold game.
3077568	3081732	They're like, hold on, let's see what we can monetize on this crap.
3081892	3108564	and then it flopped and then your X-Defiant thing flopped as well and it's like well hmm could it be because all this live service crap that you're trying to shovel into it and rush these games out and like hype them up with like saying oh we're gonna charge more for it because it's a quality game yeah okay well when you set the expectations way up here and your game comes out as absolute dog shit then people are gonna be pissed off in you know
3109284	3110665	Rightfully not going to purchase it.
3110705	3118208	They're going to watch all the reviews just trashing it and they're going to hear the reviewers going, yeah, it's a AAA or quadruple A game.
3118708	3119268	Woo.
3119688	3121229	Like, it's just, it's
3122780	3129122	It's pure, like, he just doesn't understand or doesn't care about his customer base.
3129162	3135344	They're just throwing out buzzwords for the investors because the investors hear, ooh, it's going to be a really big game.
3135524	3144528	Because remember, when he's talking about quadruple A games and the $80 price point and stuff like that and how their games are worth that, he's not talking to you, the customer.
3144548	3145308	He's talking to you.
3145908	3169391	the investors because he's trying to hype them up to get them to buy the stock at a higher price that's really the whole pitch here it's not about convincing the consumer to purchase their game because frankly no one's really paying attention to those press releases where he's talking about that your average consumer they're like ooh pirate game cool go play it yeah I don't know it's just
3172847	3173367	I don't know.
3173667	3174668	We'll see what happens.
3200055	3202896	I guess as long as they make money, but at what expense?
3204496	3212339	Anyway, let's move on and talk about if you want to run your own kingdom, you could check out Civilization 7 or CivSev, which is out right now.
3213339	3218920	Ironically, as much as I love Civ, the original Civilization is probably one of my favorite video games of all time, really.
3219641	3220601	I didn't get CivSev.
3221141	3222983	I'm going to tell you why I didn't get Civ 7 this week.
3223583	3226646	Number one, I've been busy and can't really invest those type of hours.
3227146	3242499	Number two, it's very obvious that there is a pattern with the last couple Civ games that is continuing with Civilization 7 that there will be DLC that comes out for the game that is essentially going to be mandatory, meaning it changes game mechanics.
3242619	3244841	It adds things to the game that will change...
3245481	3246402	The experience of the game.
3247022	3252186	And I don't know, I'm kind of like at this point where I'm just like sick and tired and I feel the exact same way about Mortal Kombat.
3252506	3253487	It was the exact same thing.
3253927	3261312	I'm just sick and tired of these games that are purposely coming out with like the how we are going to suck away your money over a five year plan.
3261913	3272400	You know, and it goes back to the whole Baldur's Gate 3 argument that like release the game in a finished state with everything you want in one package the first time for 70 bucks if you're going to charge 70 bucks.
3273681	3280353	Because it's very obvious there are holes that are going to be filled in with Civilization VII in expansions.
3280434	3282277	And I'm just kind of like, you know what, maybe I can wait.
3283303	3286765	Maybe I'll get suckered into a sale later on, but it probably won't be for a while.
3287105	3290587	I would think the earliest this game is going to go on sale is maybe like 4th of July sales.
3290627	3292849	And that's a little bit wishful thinking.
3293909	3295450	So we'll see.
3295570	3301374	But sure enough, potential DLC has already been data mined out of Civilization.
3301834	3309118	Thanks to folks on Reddit who were looking at the asset cloud file in Civilization 7, they found new civilizations.
3309158	3310399	This is also very common.
3310439	3312140	They release new civs you can play as.
3312820	3319686	I actually this part doesn't bother me as much because I track this as cosmetics, you know, take them or leave them.
3320026	3322088	They don't fundamentally necessarily change the game.
3322668	3326351	Ottomans, Maori, Tonga, Iceland and the Pirate Republic.
3326411	3326992	Oh, my God.
3327332	3328833	Is Bjork the leader of Iceland?
3328913	3329474	I hope so.
3329974	3331836	If not, I'm going to make her.
3331956	3334338	But well, this and Civ 7 kind of mixes it up.
3335078	3340322	You can be a leader from one civilization over another.
3340442	3342684	It's not tied to just one.
3342704	3343585	So that's kind of interesting.
3344145	3345006	But anyway.
3346146	3347307	If I may interject.
3347327	3347948	Yeah, go for it.
3348522	3356087	I like that the voices actually speak as close to the period correct version of their language as possible.
3356367	3358348	Yeah, they do go out of their way to make it authentic.
3360449	3363331	In a weird way, I feel bad for my stance, but I don't.
3364292	3369775	It's one of the worst parts of gaming business right now that I'm just kind of like, you know what?
3369875	3377660	I don't need to buy this game just to have it sit in my backlog right now when I don't really have the hours to invest in it, especially knowing I'm not really playing the final game.
3379048	3381851	There's other people, though, who are just like, I need it now.
3382072	3382973	And that's fine.
3383934	3388659	I'm not here to tell anybody else how to spend their money, but I can choose how to spend mine.
3389890	3400435	Um, now also important with this is that there is a whole new so what they mined out of this a new wonders pack that apparently is focused on Asian content.
3400495	3409720	So maybe like different sets of wonders that are, you know, more focused on some of the big things that are built in other continents is what I'm left to draw from that.
3410360	3414145	But also, this is a huge one, a whole new Atomic Age.
3414586	3421235	So ages are a big thing in this game, and right now in the game you go to the Antiquity Age, the Exploration Age, and the Modern Age.
3421535	3427983	Well, apparently there is an Atomic Age that's supposed to follow that, that was datamined out of that, and that makes a lot of sense.
3428784	3429846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3445265	3452750	It just sort of dips its toes in the Cold War, like you've identified with the thermonuclear device being the one that ends the military victory path there.
3453390	3470161	And then Dennis Shirk, executive producer, added, You can imagine the possibilities with this, honestly, and this isn't a comment about the Fourth Age, the way that the design team set it up so that each age is chock full of systems, visuals, units, sieves, all specific to that age and what you could do with that and where you could take it.
3470461	3472203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3494724	3495765	I've played Mortal Kombat 1.
3495965	3504250	I mean, besides the whole it's gross thing, playing Ghostface is actually a lot of fun because my friend has it and downloaded them.
3504310	3507292	So again, I don't care what my friends spend their money on, but I'm over it.
3509194	3511075	So, all right.
3512236	3518140	SG100 Matt in chat says, this is what bothers me is when companies say gamers are the problem because they don't get things day one anymore.
3518660	3519921	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3520561	3522863	We're getting wise to your antics, folks.
3524679	3525520	Anyway, DarkSakura.
3527242	3540614	Well, another game that was addressed in the state of play that I probably won't be getting is a version of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.
3540675	3544218	They're calling it Metal Gear Solid Delta, which is kind of stupid because it's the third game.
3546040	3548362	So shouldn't it be Gamma?
3549602	3551043	Maybe it's because Delta's a triangle.
3551983	3554244	That's my... I think that's where it is, yeah.
3555464	3563367	Anyway, it is a remastered version of Snake Eater.
3563887	3578833	And one of the things that's going to be happening is since the Ape Escape minigame thing was a PlayStation and Steam thing, they're doing Bomberman.
3579844	3582486	for their little mini game thing.
3583026	3589149	So they had like a snake versus monkey, which means you had to capture the ape escape monkeys.
3589390	3591731	So I guess you're going to be playing Bomberman with snake.
3592531	3592751	So...
3593908	3594088	Yay.
3594348	3595429	It makes sense for Konami.
3595449	3597311	It wasn't in any of the other HD versions.
3598032	3602956	Especially on a platform like Microsoft where it does not make maybe as much sense.
3603336	3603536	Yeah.
3603797	3609962	No, I'm just saying that it would make sense that Konami leads on its own archive, you know, where Bomberman would be.
3610022	3611203	But Bomberman's a cute game.
3611303	3611684	Why not?
3613370	3619895	Well, except for that one, you know, gritty Bomberman version they tried to do on the Xbox back in the day that nobody likes sitting on.
3620275	3622617	Bomberman Zero, oh god.
3622637	3626219	Because it makes me very uncomfortable.
3626660	3628801	That was a choice.
3628841	3631063	Remember the Mega Man that they were going to do in that style too?
3632851	3635112	Oh, that looked like the box art for Mega Man 1?
3635792	3636753	No, no, no, no.
3636873	3640255	They were going to do one that was in the style of Bomberman Act Zero.
3640335	3643036	It was like a super edgy Mega Man or something.
3643316	3643676	Look it up.
3643756	3646638	I forget what the title was called, but Capcom scrapped it, obviously.
3646798	3651940	The edgiest he ever needed to get was X. End of story.
3652400	3652681	Yeah.
3653121	3655102	It was Rockman X.
3657060	3659481	I think it's time for a new Mega Man, by the way.
3659941	3662521	If someone gets this game in August, just let me know.
3663121	3664722	I'll watch it on Twitch or something.
3664742	3665322	There you go.
3666602	3669083	Alright, well maybe there'll be no consoles to play it on, right, Loki?
3670503	3671003	That's right.
3671043	3680405	Well, if you want a new Mega Man, I recommend checking out Season 2 of Channel 64 on my channel, where I created a whole new set of Robot Masters themed around Minecraft characters.
3681325	3681745	Cheap plug.
3682545	3685186	Just call this show an outlet, because you're putting a plug in.
3687127	3699185	Yeah, so this is going to come to a shock to nobody, but did you know that there are fewer younger buyers of consoles in the U.S. ?
3700222	3705787	and that it's just the demographic of older people buying consoles.
3706188	3711533	Could it be because consoles are getting more expensive and everybody is making less and less money at their job?
3711893	3717739	Could it be that younger buyers are subject to predatory student loans and therefore don't have as much income?
3717899	3719481	Could that be the reason?
3719681	3723605	Could it be that you can do more with a computer?
3725441	3726481	or a phone.
3726701	3729962	I think it's that a lot of people game on their phones at this point.
3730742	3735003	Shock to no one, high-income households are becoming the biggest part of U.S.
3735063	3745486	console hardware market as 49% of the country's game console buyers during the fourth quarter of 2024 have a household income of at least $100,000 per year.
3747626	3755648	Yeah, because that's the only way you're going to afford those $500 consoles and those $70 games and those $80 quadruple A games.
3757568	3761609	Also saying that this is a record high beating the 48% seen in the fourth quarter of 2021.
3761909	3768111	Gee, I wonder what was going on in 2021 that would cause console sales to go up.
3768551	3776493	It's as if people couldn't go out and spend their money in places and so they had extra income to, I don't know, purchase things that they could do at home.
3777193	3779354	Such a novel concept.
3779615	3781976	Wow, all the things we're learning from data.
3783377	3789701	During the first quarter of 2020 as well, this group accounted for only 29% of video game hardware.
3790021	3794584	Yes, what was not going on in the first quarter of 2020, you say?
3794964	3797545	Could it be a giant pandemic wasn't going on?
3798246	3800127	Like, my God, could we just, like...
3802520	3806681	This is the biggest duh I've ever seen, you know, as far as analysts go.
3808341	3813823	Also, the demographic age 45 and above accounted for 45% of the purchases in the US console market.
3813943	3819304	Yes, because it's parents probably purchasing it for their kids because they can only have one console for the household.
3819504	3826886	Obviously, the younger kids in the family are not going to be able to afford this $500 console.
3827086	3829007	That is going to take lots of money.
3829387	3830647	It's just not a thing.
3830667	3830767	Right.
3831761	3837104	As Joe and Hunter Matt pointing out, minimum wage still at $7.25 since we were buying consoles in the early 2000s.
3838004	3838244	Ouch.
3839105	3839485	Facts.
3839925	3840125	Ouch.
3840526	3841846	We hate to see true facts.
3844287	3846829	Anyways, this is the biggest, like, duh.
3847189	3847649	Oh, I get it.
3848349	3849090	You know, thing.
3849110	3849750	But hey, cool.
3849790	3855133	Thanks, MPD, for sharing this crazy data that is completely not...
3857890	3859831	You know what would be even wilder?
3860331	3868675	Why don't, Loki, we put tariffs on countries for really silly political reasons that make no sense.
3869115	3872817	Let's drive up the price of these consoles even further and see what happens.
3873732	3881395	It's almost as if I don't know what tariffs are, and so I say, well, it worked 200 years ago, it's probably gonna work today, right?
3881896	3882716	Nothing's changed in the world.
3882736	3884817	What do you mean no one's buying a steam engine anymore?
3885497	3886058	What's that?
3886238	3888739	Everybody had tariffs and no taxes?
3889299	3893761	It's so weird that that, like, it's like, it's the same, it's like, who do you think pays those tariffs?
3893921	3895202	I don't know, magic elves?
3896542	3897723	Yes, the Keebler elves.
3898915	3900796	The other countries are paying those tariffs.
3900816	3901576	That'll show them.
3901596	3902876	They could pay everything in cookies.
3903616	3905597	And then they're like, we'll just charge you right back.
3905637	3907538	He's like, wait, no, not like that.
3908438	3910759	And then we have people that are elected into office.
3910779	3912379	Here's the tangent we're going on here.
3912599	3915060	They have the dumbest fucking ideas.
3915160	3918541	Like, hey, let's name Greenland Red, White, and Blue Land.
3918581	3919881	How about you go fuck yourself?
3920241	3921762	How about you go fuck yourself instead?
3922242	3929825	or let's fire all of the people that make our air navigation and transportation systems.
3930926	3936548	Fire all the people who keep it safe and then have a plane crash every three days.
3936668	3938749	Fire all the people in charge of the nuclear arsenal.
3938769	3939169	Thank you.
3939250	3942611	That's the one I was going for too.
3943111	3947093	Or give a certain asshole in tech access to everybody's IRS records.
3947373	3949894	That's one that just came up on my radar yesterday.
3949954	3950554	The whole world...
3952079	3955101	The whole United States is going to shit, so that's fine.
3955601	3959763	But hey, buy consoles because, you know, consume.
3961864	3962645	Yeah, I don't know.
3962685	3963985	Be more distracted.
3966467	3976452	Just be more distracted through all of this stuff and spend the money on it so that we're happy and you're not paying attention to the real shit going on in the world.
3977728	3982151	SGO100 Matt in chat with a real good point saying at least... That was disproven.
3983192	3983832	He didn't say that?
3984432	3985753	I thought there was audio of it out there.
3986574	3990276	It was not said to the turd in question.
3991296	3992377	Snopes got a hold of that.
3992637	3992997	All right.
3993057	3994218	If it's on Snopes, I won't read it.
3994298	3994558	All right.
3997230	3997951	Well, let's move on.
3997991	4001516	We got one more that this is facts talking about Overwatch 2.
4002317	4008786	And I think we've been very curious where Overwatch 2 is going to go in light of Marvel Rivals and all the things that have been happening over there.
4009587	4011951	It's kind of the question is your move, Overwatch.
4012031	4012712	What are you going to do?
4013192	4021499	And as it turns out, yeah, Overwatch I think is feeling the heat a little bit, and they are doing a lot for Season 15 with the big update.
4022319	4026382	So there's going to be a whole new perks system that's going to be introduced.
4027223	4033088	So perks will – during a match, you get two opportunities to pick a perk for your hero.
4033508	4036891	This sounds very similar to the way like a League of Legends or a –
4039172	4040653	Lane Game would play.
4041153	4042654	So that's kind of interesting.
4043254	4046376	Also the return of loot box rewards.
4046496	4047396	This is huge.
4048317	4050558	They have decided that loot boxes will be returning.
4050598	4052779	It's going to be another way to get the cosmetics in the game.
4053159	4056120	You get loot boxes from doing weekly and event rewards.
4056460	4061803	You get one legendary loot box for having the free battle pass or two if you have the premium battle pass.
4063604	4065745	They will be publishing drop rates for boxes.
4066815	4075180	and Blizzard Guarantees a rare or better item will drop in every single box with an epic item within 5 consecutive boxes and a legendary item within 20.
4075240	4076921	Do you have to buy them?
4078461	4086066	I don't know if it's said that they are because I think this is being added on top of the current system not instead of it.
4087054	4110542	so it will be like you can get your cosmetics this way or this way so I would assume that loot boxes will be for sale but I don't know how much or any of that at this time so but people are actually thrilled that loot boxes are coming back I mean and I can see when it's side by side with the other line with the other way what?
4111400	4112440	I said, that's a headline.
4112480	4112721	Yeah, right.
4112741	4115062	They're thrilled that loot boxes are coming back.
4115122	4116362	No, they apparently are.
4116462	4117603	Remember that you said that.
4117703	4117943	Yeah.
4118063	4119183	Remember that you said that.
4119964	4120284	I get it.
4120464	4120764	You know what?
4120784	4126606	Being able to earn them through in-game stuff and getting cosmetics for things you do, it does give you something to work towards in-game.
4126706	4128507	I don't think it's the most terrible thing in the world.
4128947	4129788	No, I agree.
4130408	4133969	I agree in the sense of, like, you know, earn through game.
4135490	4138331	But is it really going to stay there?
4138351	4138391	No.
4138491	4139071	Ask yourself.
4139151	4139952	Search in your soul.
4141451	4145873	Are they going to resist the temptation from making more money?
4146773	4149434	Would they possibly leave money on the table?
4149794	4151915	Fuck no, they're not going to leave money on the table.
4153436	4154836	This is also interesting as well.
4155256	4164480	In Season 16, so this is later down the road because 15 is coming, and then in 16, Overwatch 2 will get a new stadium game mode.
4164980	4165980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4185646	4186907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4214530	4216112	Season 15 launches on Tuesday.
4217273	4219294	So you're going to see some of those overhauls pretty quick.
4219755	4221296	I think the competition is very good.
4221416	4226861	I'm glad that Blizzard's being needled a little bit here with Marvel Rivals and its success.
4227001	4231345	It's not that Marvel Rivals is a perfect game, but I think people just kind of appreciate the change of pace right now.
4231645	4233987	But it'll be interesting to see what Overwatch 2 sort of
4235342	4238904	You know, disrupting a little bit is going to do to the scene.
4238964	4241166	But, you know, I love it in the MMO space.
4241206	4244148	Final Fantasy XIV needled WoW and now it's going the other way.
4244228	4246069	WoW is needling Final Fantasy XIV.
4246489	4248170	I think it's great and there's room for both.
4248851	4250832	You know, you can play more than one video game in your life.
4251372	4253734	So, we'll see what continues with this.
4255015	4260378	Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time when there were no seasons in video games.
4261059	4262760	One and done.
4263500	4264381	Let's roll the bumper.
4275034	4282336	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4282817	4285417	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4286318	4290519	Well, I accidentally let the Neo Geo noise through so they know it's going to be that.
4290579	4292740	But what did you pick for tonight's game, DarkSakura?
4293749	4323238	the game I picked is Puzzle de Pon it is a puzzle game that was made by VSCO Corporation came out in 1995 and released for Neo Geo Arcade the name the pon comes from the sound it's sort of like a Japanese onomatopoeia saying pon is the sound of something popping or breaking I play the crap out of this when I used to work at the pizza place I play the crap out of this
4324329	4329632	Puzzle de Pon actually plays very similarly to Puzzle Bobble, or as we got it, Bust a Move.
4330513	4333715	And the actual concept of the game was licensed from Taito.
4334476	4337037	So there's some big differences, however.
4338158	4340620	You don't have to clear all the balls on the screen.
4340660	4343681	You just have to get this little panel in the center.
4345623	4369684	to be released by the balls to get it to let go and so once the shape or the drop token is released then you move on to the next level you do also have a time limit to do that in and of course if you don't manage to bust enough balls before it hits that bottom line then of course you also lose there yeah I said it
4370805	4399027	so there are 39 levels in the game divided into groups of three the first two it's generic third level you start getting a zodiac sign level 39 is the sun sign and once you beat the game you become the sun god and you ride across the earth in your sun chariot and you're suddenly a blonde and some of the levels though from this actually went on to be adopted into the puzzle bobble games
4400137	4424649	and so, you know, the game had a sequel in 1997 that came out on Neo Geo MVS was Puzzle Depon R and it's the same concept but different stages and really, that's it I think, did this not get a release in the Neo Geo Museum series?
4426545	4427166	I think it did.
4428427	4435952	But at any rate, or like in one of the Neo Geo re-releases, I don't recall this having an MBS release.
4436813	4443158	No, Mike, you become, I'm sorry, Bones, you become Apollo who would ride across the sky in a chariot.
4444759	4445380	I would think so.
4446901	4447301	I don't know.
4448202	4449183	It's a different Zodiac.
4450083	4450784	But at any rate.
4452126	4474802	um the game is uh is uh that's it really i it was a one shot it's a fun game and if you haven't played it fix that it's it's puzzle bobble but not it's addicting yeah it's fun all right plus i love that you pop the bubble and it just goes boom
4476721	4479082	We love sound effects and that whole thing.
4479142	4481624	I love the onomatopoeia.
4484345	4485986	It's just a fun word to say as well.
4486166	4487307	It's up there with undulate.
4488208	4491710	With that, we're actually kind of done with news tonight.
4491750	4493691	We just have a few more segments for you.
4494311	4496232	And we'll see if you all want to call in.
4496272	4498293	I know we have a couple emails tonight, which is great.
4499494	4502716	But before we get to that, we want to cover the release dates as we always do.
4502816	4505858	So let's go to the US with Loki and check out the release dates.
4507281	4509141	Alright, so let's see.
4509241	4511202	This week we've got a few things.
4511602	4516943	One, the game behind me, Avowed, finally coming out for those who don't want to pay the $20 premium.
4518023	4520324	It's on PC and Xbox Series.
4521104	4524024	We have Berserk Boy on PlayStation 5.
4525345	4530666	Lost Records Bloom and Rage Tape 1 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
4531526	4534707	Godzilla Voxel Wars on Nintendo Switch.
4535427	4536047	That sounds funny.
4536829	4541556	Yeah, it sounds like the Earth Defense Force World Heroes, you know, how it was done in that kind of...
4543448	4550049	Oh gosh, what was the, uh, there was another voxel, like, kind of Zelda-type game where you can get this extremely large sword.
4550850	4554150	Anyways, uh, um, The King of Fighters!
4554830	4568113	We have, uh, The King of Fighters 13 Global Match on PC, um, Pixel Cross, Rune Factory on PC and Nintendo Switch, Stories from Soul, The Gundog,
4570400	4574301	PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 Is that a dog with a gun?
4575141	4577502	Here's hoping.
4577562	4578402	I gotta see that.
4579002	4585404	Is it a gun dog or is it... That just makes me think about how disappointed I am with Squirrel with a gun.

4754352	4756533	And we are done with our stories.
4756693	4760234	But I believe we have some folks that sent us emails this week.
4760254	4761494	And you can send us emails as well.
4761554	4764395	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.
4764815	4770417	We also encourage you to participate through our Discord channel throughout the week at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
4770837	4776398	And we also have our Blue Sky at OrangeLawnTrader.com is where you can follow us on Blue Sky.
4776978	4778559	But emails, DarkSakura.
4780177	4785279	So the first one comes from Net Zero.
4787140	4788280	Hello, OLR crew.
4788320	4789040	I love the show.
4789180	4791561	What are your Nintendo Switch 2 price predictions?
4791741	4794002	I predict $600, but $500 if we're lucky.
4794322	4794642	Thank you.
4794762	4795162	Love, Sam.
4796443	4796963	Thanks, Sam.
4799984	4801405	I'm going to actually lowball it and say $450.
4801445	4801525	Okay.
4803435	4809337	We had got into this a little bit because I remember the tariff thing was a big discussion that same week.
4810458	4827263	So I'm still sticking with my whole, if the tariffs are a concern and mess things up, I believe Nintendo will bundle in Mario Kart 9 to absorb the cost, and therefore the system will cost $480, maybe even as high as $500, but I think that's about as high as it could possibly go with a bundled game.
4828424	4828984	If they...
4830624	4833125	I think the interesting thing is, I think you're going to be paying $500 either way.
4833525	4836226	It's just, is Nintendo going to eat the cost of Mario Kart 9 or not?
4836546	4842308	Because I think the other way is, the console will probably be $400, and then the game will cost you another $80.
4842808	4847990	But I sort of am like, I feel like everybody's going to get Mario Kart 9, but not everybody.
4848250	4852371	So maybe some people are getting it to play upgraded versions of their old Switch games.
4852791	4855153	Assuming that is a thing, I'm going out on a limb.
4856735	4858096	Or other things that release on it.
4858416	4864041	But I think I'm sticking to $400 for this system by itself, $480 if tariffs get fucky.
4864982	4865623	Loki, what about you?
4868125	4869106	I don't think it goes over $349.
4869426	4872269	Ooh, you're coming a little lower.
4872469	4872809	All right.
4874210	4874571	We'll see.
4874591	4875732	Maybe $399, but it won't go over $400.
4875772	4875912	Yeah.
4880103	4881524	Yeah, when I say 400, I mean 399.
4882304	4882804	Let's be real.
4882864	4883025	That's 400.
4883105	4885286	Okay.
4886886	4887127	Great.
4887247	4888387	Thanks for the email and the question.
4890568	4890969	Is there another?
4891849	4892109	Yeah.
4892649	4897492	First of all, it started off with Jamie Rocks, so it's already my favorite email so far.
4897512	4899333	Oh, somebody knowing how to get read on air.
4899353	4899433	Yeah.
4901158	4930272	kudos to Jamie, DarkSakura, Summers thank you, I don't know what I did though out of genuinely morbid curiosity, are there any major furry slash animal character based drag queens, not counting of course fursuiters outside the drag community with characters of I don't like the word opposite gender with characters of a different gender is what I will say and I assume Sigourney Beaver doesn't count, that comes from Robert M there are no opposite genders there are just multiple genders, there's no opposites when many exist
4931263	4940827	So I'm going to talk about Brenda Banks, who used to be called Benchilla back in the day, was a drag queen furry.
4940847	4957095	I don't know if Arrietty counts, because Don, I think Don did a lot of, I don't know if Don counts as a furry, but Don did a lot of animal-based outfits.
4959179	4960600	Here's my kind of counterpoint.
4962221	4963602	Furry conventions are a thing.
4964283	4965864	Great for those that are into the community.
4966045	4976354	And as I understand, usually these furry conventions, there will be the equivalent of what you would see as an anime expo that would do like the show, the – what do they call it?
4976414	4976554	The –
4977878	4978638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4994486	4996767	Isn't that drag of some sort?
4996867	5007833	Like, I mean, if you kind of go by the old RuPaul adage, and yes, I know grandma's got issues sometimes, but I do tend to prescribe to the whole you're born naked and the rest is drag sort of thing.
5007913	5017217	And if furry is how you choose to sort of represent yourself in your, you know, nightlife or when you're around your chosen family and stuff, isn't that kind of drag?
5018098	5019238	And that's not a negative thing at all.
5019258	5021940	I'm taking it as how they self-identify.
5021960	5022040	Yeah.
5022180	5022380	Yeah.
5023863	5027164	Do you identify as a drag queen and a furry?
5028084	5031225	Are you a drag queen who does animal-based things?
5031285	5031865	I see what you mean.
5031945	5034746	Is there somebody out there who does claim both that we know of?
5035026	5035626	I don't know of any.
5035646	5036907	That's why I brought up who I brought up.
5036987	5038427	Yeah, and I don't know of any.
5039327	5041508	But I think that Dawn counted.
5043648	5049550	I kind of have a feeling that Arrietty might, but it's a very animal-based makeup.
5050280	5060104	Several of the drag performers that have been on Dragula would consider themselves drag monsters, which is not quite furry, but it's getting there.
5060524	5062445	You know, think a little more Alien and Predator.
5063105	5069347	But yes, you know, if you like your furry things to bite, you might see that with those performers.
5069927	5071508	So, yeah.
5072328	5075209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5099016	5101977	Well, that's presentation.
5102538	5104679	I don't look at it as the same thing.
5105619	5117044	I mean, and I'll admit, and I think I'm a bit... I mean, there's a lot of me in this, of course, but I think that I get a little bit different when I'm on the show versus how I am outside.
5117104	5124307	I mean, I'm kind of a... I will talk to you in the grocery store line, but otherwise, don't look at me.
5124367	5125568	I'm very much an ambivert.
5127635	5155223	and it's I think we all but I mean also being autistic I mask a lot I have to to be able to to make it anywhere and I think that we all have the masks that we wear sure depending on our situation I don't like to think of that in technical terms as drag you know but I think that every I think drag is a mask
5156781	5166830	I think that everyone has these personas that they display situationally or fursona as the case may be
5167557	5172858	Yes, but I believe that it was, I always mispronounce his name, Deepak Chopra?
5173618	5196122	You know, I think that in one of his books he discussed having the true self, the truest self is the self on the inside and that the outer that is your permanent self is the true self on the inside and your self on the outside is the constantly changing self I know we're getting into philosophy but
5197651	5224197	I see that as a very real thing we all do it not necessarily that we're you know for some of us who are literally masking these aspects of our personality but for some people it's like a switch even happens in language I'm sure you know of code switching right oh yeah so we all it's a human thing unfortunately a lot of gay guys have to do it at their job and all sorts of people on the LGBTQIA rainbow but they they have to do that at their day jobs
5225799	5237684	Can you imagine what it's like hanging around with a bunch of thirsty bitches talking about wanting to get in somebody else's pants and being the person there is like... Gross?
5239945	5247388	I did think of, you know, my favorite furry drag performer would be when Loki wore the little Big Planet costume to the show.
5248568	5251429	So Loki is my favorite furry drag performer.
5253490	5254771	Well, you see this...
5255994	5257683	My little VTuber?
5257924	5258225	Yeah!
5259210	5259833	She's a ferret!
5261721	5264142	Your VTuber is kind of a form of drag in a way.
5264382	5266883	I mean, but I get what you're talking.
5266923	5268263	You're equating it to like the masks.
5268383	5269263	Yeah, the mask thing.
5269303	5270224	And I'm just saying, eh, it's all drag.
5270244	5272544	This is literally me not wanting to put on makeup anymore.
5274545	5276366	This is like, I'm going to sit around.
5276986	5278746	I will tell y'all what I'm wearing right now.
5279407	5281767	I am wearing my Trash Panda onesie.
5282228	5283648	And I'm fucking comfortable.
5283688	5284548	Girl, what are you wearing?
5284588	5285689	And I'm not wearing makeup.
5285769	5286989	What are you wearing right now?
5287409	5288390	This is real hot.
5288450	5289490	Tell me what you're wearing.
5290051	5293998	I'm actually pretty warm because this thing is made out of very thick fleece.
5294038	5297064	I'm wearing a t-shirt, jammies, and no bra.
5298747	5299328	You know what?
5299608	5300009	Fact.
5300250	5302213	I will freely admit I ain't wearing a bra.
5303591	5326258	and you know anyone who don't like it, you don't get to say anything about what the fuck I'm wearing, so fuck off I know enough lady friends that know exactly what happens if there is no company expected the first thing that happens when you walk in the door when you get home from work, the one-handed removal the slingshot, the bra slingshot and also I found not too long ago how to literally use your bra as a slingshot as a survival tool
5328084	5330466	A little fact about y'all.
5330526	5331426	I've said this before.
5331646	5333328	I'm into the whole survival thing.
5334488	5337710	I have a survival kit in my... I have an axe in my car.
5338251	5341253	Oh, thinking about you going... I have fire starters.
5342093	5343694	Thinking about you going on Survivor.
5346036	5351940	No, I'm thinking of me when the collapse of humanity happens and the EMP wipes out all electronics.
5352480	5353481	I'm going to be okay.
5353801	5354081	Okay.
5356424	5380158	it's actually a personal real fear of mine that I will be caught in a situation where I have to fend for myself and so the way that I manage this maybe unreasonable fear is I teach myself actual survival skills and I have a survival kit in my car so if anything is gonna happen I got you
5381161	5382882	I also planned for the zombie apocalypse.
5382902	5387304	I was going to say, we're trying not to have The Last of Us happen for real, but you know.
5388264	5392826	But what was that sports place out in, was it in Carmichael, Orangevale?
5393246	5395387	It's gone now, but it was just a big brick building.
5396868	5399028	That place would have been the perfect zombie apocalypse place.
5399048	5400149	Oh, the bowling alley?
5401289	5403530	No, not the bowling alley, the sports shop.
5403550	5405271	Brick building, sports shop.
5405611	5407232	It was like a plain white building.
5408150	5411875	and you could get, you know, you had guns and MREs and knives and camping gear.
5411895	5413618	Big five sporting goods or something like that?
5413938	5417983	No, it's not big five, but they're out of business, but it was out there.
5418164	5423270	And we used to always think this was the perfect place because they had two exits.
5425234	5452280	S2100 Matt says Arco Arena, that's the only place the people not from Sacramento only ever hear me never shut up about Arco Arena I'm going to have to ask Dan because that place would have been the perfect Oh, pod culture suggests a Costco Most are concrete and plenty of supplies Except you've got multiple entrances and exits in a Costco You've got multiple loading bays You have big front glass doors for the record
5453925	5459969	You got all the stuff you'll need to live, but one mess up, one door unguarded, and you're fucked.
5460149	5461149	Oh, also the ceiling.
5461209	5463291	The ceiling would probably be an easy ingress as well.
5463311	5464771	This place was full cinder block.
5466392	5467833	I wish I knew what place you're talking about now.
5468293	5469514	I wish I knew what place you're talking about now.
5469814	5472336	It closed down like a while back, though.
5473456	5473737	All right.
5474097	5474497	Oh, anyway.
5474837	5477459	Anyway, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
5478908	5479389	I do not.
5479871	5480172	All right.
5480352	5482718	I figured because it's kind of been a slower news week.
5483139	5486188	SSG100 Matt says zombies can't come in without their membership card.
5487800	5510103	participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week but with that we're wrapping it up for the night and that is our show remember I'm going on vacation and I'm taking the show with me so I'll be out for a couple weeks sorry that's just the way the timing worked out but we will be back on March 9th with an all new episode of Orange Launch Radio I hope you all have some good time gaming I hope we have a lot of news to catch up on when we get back
5511083	5512164	Maybe, who knows?
5512244	5516868	I'm not ruling out that we do like a midweek catch-up thing if everybody's available after I'm back.
5516888	5518730	Because I technically get back from the cruise on March.
5519150	5521932	It's just the problem is I come back on a Sunday.
5523273	5526436	And I won't be home in time because we fly back into SFO.
5527056	5529358	So it's going to take me too long to get home.
5530339	5531340	Oh, was there a Sky tweet?
5531400	5531820	I missed it.
5531860	5532140	Hold on.
5532220	5532901	I'll look real quick.
5534162	5534943	I don't know why I missed it.
5536244	5536544	Hold on.
5536684	5537545	I'll get it, DarkTitsia.
5538465	5539046	We have a moment.
5540151	5542192	We're professionals.
5543092	5543512	Oh, yes.
5543552	5545953	We do this podcast not for a living.
5546694	5548014	I do remember seeing this now.
5548034	5548574	Sorry, I forgot.
5548614	5551936	Dark to CS tweets us or, you know, not tweets us, whatever you want to call it.
5552296	5559058	Says, had to sky tweet y'all that we were just watching Battle Royale for our Valentine's Day night festivities.
5559098	5560339	Well, that's a good selection.
5560819	5564921	Made me reminisce about the IRL Battle Royale incident from back in the day.
5564941	5565161	Good times.
5565181	5565861	Good times.
5566041	5577267	Paper Plate Battle Royale that's right when we used to I won that by the way when we used to tape this at that old house in Citrus Heights I used to live at a long time ago do you know that pool got filled in
5578393	5579554	That's a travesty.
5579614	5580114	I know.
5580374	5580634	I know.
5581055	5583756	I guess that pool was too many bad memories and too expensive.
5583796	5585117	He ended up filling it in at some point.
5585477	5587839	He also ended up – he got married and had kids.
5588239	5591101	I think it was the whole like he didn't want the pool to be a danger to kids.
5591661	5593062	I can respect that for sure.
5593542	5595644	But it was just one of those like, oh, when I heard about that.
5596604	5596845	Anyway.
5596885	5597105	Yeah.
5598106	5600208	Alright, that's it.
5600248	5601630	The paper plate battle royale.
5601970	5602531	We're done.
5602611	5603272	We're out of here.
5604093	5606656	But not until we get some final thoughts.
5606716	5609018	DarkSakura, you're doing Debbie tonight?
5610159	5614965	I am because it's 400% survivor blood points in both modes.
5616430	5617290	Good times.
5617750	5623751	Yeah, I have some hungry people to prestige.
5624031	5625232	So I'll be doing that.
5625292	5627232	I'll have a Shay and a Smokey with me.
5627972	5629612	Maybe a few others, anyone who wants to join in.
5631113	5638394	But my big thing, everyone, every small act of resistance is still an act of resistance.

5653322	5658243	My final thought is there's this game I just saw the trailer for called Guns of Fury.
