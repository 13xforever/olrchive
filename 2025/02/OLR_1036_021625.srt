1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft sure paints a rosy picture for a company that appears to be getting into financial trouble.

2
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:17,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite a one-third downturn in finances, pre-sales for the next Assassin's Creed are tracking solidly.

3
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:23,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Previews have been positive, Rainbow Six Siege has had resilient performance, and the crew at Motorfest is doing better than its predecessor.

4
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:27,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're ahead of schedule in cutting costs, and discipline will see them through the rough waters.

5
00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:29,309
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Shareholder Value Headline.

6
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:34,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about Ubisoft's numbers and the rest of the week's gaming news.

7
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:36,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...

8
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:46,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:54,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live once again with episode number 1036 of our show for tonight, February the 16th of 2025.

12
00:00:57,389 --> 00:00:59,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Valentine's Day weekend.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy chocolates on discount weekend.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy President's Day weekend.

15
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever it is you're celebrating this weekend.

16
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope it is going great.

17
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:08,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for spending some time with us.

18
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:12,473
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts here with you every week as well as my co-hosts.

19
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

20
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Gavin Newsom?

21
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:18,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

22
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding!

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Kidding!

24
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:41,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

25
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:45,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember City Hall, how that whole thing started?

26
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:45,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, forget it.

27
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:46,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

28
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,407
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was great.

29
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:48,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,047
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm like, you know what?

31
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:51,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over it.

32
00:01:51,648 --> 00:02:00,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dan and I did our thing where we drank wine and ate spinach dip and French bread.

33
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not watch UHF this year.

34
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,751
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up watching anime intros.

35
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:09,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of our listeners may not know the story about UHF and why that's important for you and Dan.

36
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:21,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we first got together after I moved out here in January, about a few weeks later, we got engaged on Valentine's Day.

37
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were on that day eating French bread and spinach dip and drinking Menashevitz Blackberry Wine.

38
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,125
[SPEAKER_02]: and we were watching UHF.

39
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got married seven years later.

40
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:41,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And 10 years after that, we met Weird Al backstage at a meet and greet for the mandatory fun truck.

41
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,590
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I remember that, yeah.

42
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And Al signed our copy of UHF and said, I'm sorry, you're still together?

43
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,814
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought it was cute.

44
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:51,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

45
00:02:51,534 --> 00:02:52,715
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very Al thing to do.

46
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,595
[SPEAKER_02]: He was such a sweet guy.

47
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

48
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And then three years after that, I got a theater of magic.

49
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:58,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Weirdo Alan.

50
00:02:58,657 --> 00:02:59,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Weirdo Alan.

51
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:03,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a computer of magic three years later.

52
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 13th on it, which we bought from a co-worker.

53
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:36,567
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

54
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's always a show Valentine's Day weekend.

55
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:57,730
[SPEAKER_06]: And the local company that puts this on tends to pair it up.

56
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,913
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to rent the theater anyway, they might as well do a Friday show and a Saturday show.

57
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:07,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So they did like a burlesque, drag, variety, comedy, all that on Friday night.

58
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Sigourney Beaver from Dragula there, my favorite drag name ever, Sigourney Beaver.

59
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's great.

60
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I love her because she's like half drag, half burlesque.

61
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:18,822
[SPEAKER_06]: She's really nice too.

62
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:20,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people in that industry have a little bit of ego.

63
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:24,244
[SPEAKER_06]: In the reality TV front, you get all sorts of mix of people.

64
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people kind of have the delusions of grandeur thing going on.

65
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,866
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm happy to say Sigourney is great.

66
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:36,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I can always tell the sign of humility when the talent like that doesn't want their own dressing room.

67
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:40,930
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to get ready in the same room as all the other performers to get to know them.

68
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm always like, yeah, that's a real sign.

69
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:43,891
[SPEAKER_06]: That's

70
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's somebody that like is down to earth and you want to work with and doesn't forget their roots.

71
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:49,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So love that.

72
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:50,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Love that about her and everything.

73
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: But this has been the thing for like the last, you know, outside of the COVID years, probably the last eight years at least.

74
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So Alan and I are pretty used to not really actually doing anything on Valentine's Day, but...

75
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:05,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Starboard Power Coupling

76
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and most every year, you know, obviously COVID fucked things up.

77
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:29,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will be our fourth cruise.

78
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:33,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so Alan and I go on a cruise instead.

79
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:42,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We booked a very, we booked an extra dollar dinner to do something very, very fancy while we're out there in the middle of the ocean on our way to East Mexico.

80
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:45,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, really excited for icebergs.

81
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:46,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

82
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,257
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Caribbean.

83
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, climate change is real.

84
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:51,780
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

85
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, climate change is

86
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:54,702
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.

87
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:10,468
[SPEAKER_06]: What was I going to say about that?

88
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:16,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, a reminder to all of you, because I'm gone and we won't be here for three weeks.

89
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our last show until March 9th.

90
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:24,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our very first actual hiatus.

91
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:28,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've left for three weeks before.

92
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:32,139
[SPEAKER_06]: An actual hiatus.

93
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: An actual hiatus.

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Shay's still here.

95
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Shay's playing Dead by Daylight, Brad.

96
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:38,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

97
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Phil of Nine in chat says, did you hear about the Star Trek experience at Universal Studios?

98
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go.

99
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different, but yes, I want to go.

100
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:53,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't been to fucking Mario Land at Universal.

101
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:54,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to go.

102
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:56,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just go.

103
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You know who lives down there?

104
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Arya Snark or Lady Victoria is right there at Universal.

105
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we should.

106
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:01,911
[SPEAKER_06]: We really should.

107
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:02,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Road trip.

108
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw Rainbow Lemur

109
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, Avowed's getting real good reviews, though.

110
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:28,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I refuse to pay for the early access, but I hope to jump in.

111
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out officially on, what, the 18th or something like that?

112
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:31,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe tomorrow.

113
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably a Game Pass, I think.

114
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked it up on PC, though, too.

115
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:43,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't it only come out, like, oh, maybe it's Game Pass on the 18th, and if you buy it now, you have it.

116
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:45,989
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, yeah, I'm waiting for the Game Pass release.

117
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:47,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the early access, or...

118
00:07:50,888 --> 00:08:06,783
[SPEAKER_06]: early access it's like early edition essentially $20 more and you get it like you could play it now it's like oh so that's that's the shit I won't do yeah so uh I only did it for Diablo 4 and even then I'm like why did I do that but I had time how dirty did you feel about that

119
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:07,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

120
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:36,849
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, Loki, I was going to ask you, since DarkSakura was talking a little bit about the engagement story, remind me how you and Nelly got engaged, Mrs. Loki.

121
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,388
[SPEAKER_05]: How we got engaged?

122
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:41,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just asked her.

123
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,930
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what happened with Alan and I, to be fair.

124
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,432
[SPEAKER_06]: After Trump won the election the first time, we were like, well, I'm sorry, but this is how it happened.

125
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We were like, all right.

126
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:56,273
[SPEAKER_06]: We better get married before we can't.

127
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did.

128
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:00,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we didn't have a big old ceremony or anything.

129
00:09:01,277 --> 00:09:02,898
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki had a nice ceremony.

130
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:03,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in it.

131
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:04,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cute.

132
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:05,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was good.

133
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:18,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we went to some retirement community's golf course and they had a nice thing there where we got married out and they're like, I don't know what it is.

134
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,048
[SPEAKER_06]: But you could tell they were used to weddings.

135
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:23,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very much like a wedding, a pleasant wedding venue.

136
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:23,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

137
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fun way.

138
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:27,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember your DJ having problems.

139
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:28,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he's an idiot.

140
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,888
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, it was all right.

141
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:36,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Because originally, like, so, like, you know, here's the best DJ ever.

142
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:43,640
[SPEAKER_05]: We gave him a CD with the music that we wanted to use.

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelly is Jewish, and so she wanted to walk down to Sunrise Sunset.

144
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:53,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought that would be cute.

145
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:58,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of that, he played...

146
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the SWB!

147
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:34,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we don't want you to play the chicken dance or any of those corny ass... The cha-cha slide, I swear to God.

148
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God.

149
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm jumping out a window the next time I hear that fucking song.

150
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,693
[SPEAKER_05]: He did all of them.

151
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,555
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the worst.

152
00:10:42,895 --> 00:10:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after all that, he's like, so would you recommend me?

153
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend you find a new job.

154
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:56,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Recommend you quit drugs.

155
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those guys.

156
00:10:58,377 --> 00:10:59,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We found him, I think.

157
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend Microsoft OneNote and keep some notes on your clients.

158
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was like, I don't know why we went with him.

159
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,003
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have went with my uncle.

160
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,745
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also a DJ and like he would have been an idiot.

161
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I don't know, but whatever.

162
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,327
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

163
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,128
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something we can look back and laugh at.

164
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:17,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

165
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:24,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and he keeps calling me by the wrong name when he's addressing me too.

166
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:25,847
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just a moron.

167
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:26,988
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like an idiot.

168
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:28,469
[SPEAKER_05]: How hard is your job?

169
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:29,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

170
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not that hard.

171
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:32,313
[SPEAKER_05]: You play CDs.

172
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:32,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

173
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:37,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

174
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:39,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what, though?

175
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:45,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter the quality of the reception because y'all are still married all these years later.

176
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:47,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, it worked out in the end.

177
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:49,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And marriage is more important than the wedding.

178
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:50,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

179
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:56,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the wedding, we were just tired and we went to a bed and breakfast for like a few days.

180
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,152
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

181
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the courthouse and didn't have a honeymoon.

182
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,874
[SPEAKER_02]: We just stayed home and played video games.

183
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:13,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we just went to the courthouse and we didn't tell anybody until... It actually worked out kind of nice because then on inauguration day, we were able to make the social media posts.

184
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was able to be like, ha, we're taking attention away from what's going on today.

185
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a lovely feeling.

186
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:24,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we could have done it again last month, but you know.

187
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:30,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in the country is looking at your social media.

188
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I did joke with Alan.

189
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:35,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, hey, Alan, do you want to adopt a baby on January 20th?

190
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, we have to one-up the news from eight years ago somehow.

191
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, we've already decided children are not in our future.

192
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people's children, yes.

193
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:45,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Our own children, no.

194
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:47,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best thing.

195
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You borrow them and give them back when you're done.

196
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:56,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, put your kid on loan to me for 24 hours and I'm going to give it back, hopefully without damage.

197
00:12:56,105 --> 00:13:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not a society that's kind to bodies with uteri, which is my current plural version of uterus.

198
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

199
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:08,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell does point out, I posted about kittens on Inauguration Day this year.

200
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I did adopt kittens on the 20th.

201
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been a good thing.

202
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,308
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a really good idea as well.

203
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're ready because we know the cruise is looming.

204
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we're ready to get a new cat.

205
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we lost Smush early this year.

206
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:25,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been in the back of our minds that, yeah, we want to adopt a Cheddar, a friend, even though Cheddar is very antisocial and doesn't want a friend.

207
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,079
[SPEAKER_06]: He never mourned, by the way.

208
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and she's not going to get a friend.

209
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:37,302
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we get back from the cruise, you may hear about a little something-something.

210
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:42,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the kitten adoption agency or whatever that placed Cheddar with us.

211
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Smush we found through a friend of a friend.

212
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:48,070
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually went through an adoption agency for Cheddar.

213
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And they heard about Mr. Smush.

214
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:53,835
[SPEAKER_06]: through Instagram or whatever.

215
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:58,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have definitely been sending Alan, like, look at this cat.

216
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,823
[SPEAKER_06]: This cat would be a great mix for fixer cheddar.

217
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't this cat lovely?

218
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:03,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate the work they're trying to do.

219
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:07,130
[SPEAKER_06]: They are trying to, you know, they're trying to find homes for these cats and all that stuff.

220
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we're like, not yet.

221
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:10,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, not yet.

222
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,397
[SPEAKER_06]: You just, you block them until March.

223
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:42,570
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an animal group that does TNR and Rehams Fosters all volunteer and they helped me with a kitten that I had rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue and because of them I went to one of the Pet Smarts that they did their adoptions through and that's where I got Midna so I could specifically it's an animal outreach of Diamond Springs and they supplied a lot of them in Citrus Heights and Roseville and what not interesting

224
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,900
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really, really good people.

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,291
[SPEAKER_02]: They went all out, had people drive down and meet me downtown to take this kitten.

226
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:55,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And my car smelled like tuna for a week, but it was fine.

227
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:59,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Those cat rescue people do really good work, and they do thorough work.

228
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:05,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can afford to do TNR, that's trap, neuter, release, please do.

229
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:14,184
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times your local humane society will work with you, or there are other vets that provide the service pro bono for spaying and neutering cats.

230
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the best thing for a feral cat that if you get them fixed...

231
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:24,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Their ears get knocked and they put right back in their community because they cannot be socialized.

232
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Kittens, wait till they're weaned, get them adopted.

233
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not always true.

234
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:34,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one that's got a notched ear that we... That's right.

235
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a walk-in cat, right?

236
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was the cat distribution system.

237
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:41,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's the cat distribution system.

238
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:42,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still like on loan.

239
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,021
[SPEAKER_05]: She comes and goes as she feels like it.

240
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, a lot of ferals cannot be socialized and it really is the best for them emotionally and safety-wise for everyone involved to release them back into their communities.

241
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

242
00:15:58,349 --> 00:15:59,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and I'm done.

243
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,779
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

244
00:16:44,619 --> 00:17:06,450
[SPEAKER_05]: you know it was just like I was like oh this was coming um so yeah they they announced a bunch of different things during a state of play and showed some upcoming games and demos are available and stuff like that so uh apparently the big reveal was uh Soros a new single player game that builds on I guess Returnal

245
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So that looks neat.

246
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:12,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands 3 is about to release.

247
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:17,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing that's probably getting the most attention is that particular reveal.

248
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:22,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I've seen where people were like, yes, Returnal, getting a spiritual successor, yay!

249
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, yeah, it was an early hit on the PlayStation 5.

250
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:25,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good, so...

251
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:33,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Borderlands 4 is set to release in September, which honestly is a lot sooner than I thought it would be.

252
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:44,676
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said that Gearbox is going to have a special reveal show or video that they're going to do for that coming out later this spring.

253
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:52,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And the gameplay at least looks a little bit more like Borderlands, but with a lot more movement flair to it, which...

254
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:55,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

255
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:55,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

256
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It still doesn't feel like a Borderlands game to me just yet.

257
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we've got a brand new city, I guess, action game coming.

258
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:10,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the former Grand Theft Auto 5 lead.

259
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:16,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like Cyberpunk meets Grand Theft Auto, which sign me up for that, please.

260
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But without the bugs, please.

261
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes.

262
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:28,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also we've got Days Gone Remastered is coming to PlayStation 5 with new modes.

263
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,000
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Horde, Permadeath.

264
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the remaster nobody asked for, literally.

265
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,546
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them are the remasters that nobody asked for.

266
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:41,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Games that came out on your previous console that you're remastering for.

267
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:45,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, whatever it is.

268
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:47,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Money getting money.

269
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:56,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't it feel a little bit like maybe they're trying to inflate the PlayStation 5 release calendar with re-releases?

270
00:18:57,163 --> 00:19:01,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, to be fair, Nintendo's done a very similar thing with the Switch and Wii U games.

271
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:06,731
[SPEAKER_06]: But we all know the Wii U was not the most beloved console by the masses.

272
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Niche gamers and Nintendo fans feel differently.

273
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the caveat there is...

274
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:41,526
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with like some of the stuff, like the Wii U stuff coming to the Switch, I cannot physically play the Wii U stuff on the Switch whereas these PlayStation 4 games I can play them on the PlayStation 5 true, true and so it's like, that's what makes it extra unnecessary, it would be different if it was like a PlayStation 3 game or it was a PlayStation 2 game or something that I can literally not play on that console, like if it's a thing I can play on the console already

275
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:45,246
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm sorry.

276
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:46,827
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't work.

277
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:52,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the same as if there was a Wii remaster on the Wii U or something like that.

278
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:55,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be like, well, I can already play that, though.

279
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,450
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't make any sense.

280
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:03,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it could have been high def at that point, but jumping from 480 to 1080 is a lot more than...

281
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:28,720
[SPEAKER_05]: you know 4k to 4k but yeah slightly better it's about like oh playstation 5 and playstation 5 pro look at the two screenshots it's like i can't see a difference you know is that what we're counting remaster nowadays i don't know but anyways it's coming consume good consumer enjoy

282
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Liza P is DLC is coming this summer sounds like it's going to be like a prequel they said let's see it looks like a director's cut as well Stellar Blades coming to PC which cool PlayStation games come to PC now Sonic Racing Cross Worlds this is an announcement trailer I swear this was already announced

283
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew that there was a new Sonic racing game coming, so I wanted to see.

284
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:47,763
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of chat about how it looks very much like Sonic Racing Transformed Part 2 which probably should have just been the name but that was a really good racer game they're solid games I would definitely check out this game I just hope they don't bring back Danica Patrick because she kind of sucks now maybe it's time to bring back bring in a different meme racer or something we'll bring the guy that yells Sega

285
00:21:50,182 --> 00:21:51,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring the guy that scenes the Daytona theme.

286
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be an unlockable song.

287
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I... That game looks neat.

288
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:02,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I would play that.

289
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:10,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just I hope it doesn't end up getting fucked by Mario Kart 9 coming out at the exact same time.

290
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first Transformed was right around Mario Kart 8, so the games can coexist.

291
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:21,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it had a lot, but I just... You know if it's out the same time as Mario Kart 9, that's going to really...

292
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it won't kill it, but it's just unfortunate timing.

293
00:22:27,442 --> 00:22:28,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunate timing.

294
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:28,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

295
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was going to say, like, I don't know.

296
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't watch the trailer.

297
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:36,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, if this is what it is, you know, then great.

298
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:49,617
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would love to see a racing game similar to this where essentially you kind of do the PlayStation All-Stars treatment where you have, like, you know, one game's, like, world versus the other game's world kind of, like,

299
00:22:50,177 --> 00:22:56,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixing together in a specific track or stage or something like that.

300
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:56,940
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really cool.

301
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really cool.

302
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like that would be.

303
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: With the solid state drive, it could kind of build it on the fly.

304
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:03,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be really rad.

305
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just something where it looks like Yakuza meets...

306
00:23:09,825 --> 00:23:12,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Sonic the Hedgehog or something like that.

307
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:17,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You just like mix some of the stuff together that doesn't really go, but like it could be a cool stage or something.

308
00:23:17,474 --> 00:23:17,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

309
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:18,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that.

310
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:20,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like, here's a good one.

311
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy Taxi in Daytona.

312
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, like, you know, the Daytona track or Crazy Taxi, you jump onto the Daytona.

313
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:27,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

314
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:35,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they got the crazy, you know, the taxis just like veered around and stuff like that'd be some pretty cool gameplay there.

315
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:43,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, also, we've got a new game that looks like Doom meets Armored Core.

316
00:23:45,228 --> 00:23:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

317
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:47,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see that.

318
00:23:48,477 --> 00:24:12,903
[SPEAKER_05]: um looks neat and then uh Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake uh the release date is uh confirmed and then it's going to be coming out in August uh Like a Dragon, Pirate Yakuza is going to be getting a demo uh soon as well as a Dave the Diver crossover that everybody's crossing over that was very random Dave the Diver gets around little harlot

319
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:16,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Shinobi Art of Vengeance.

320
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:18,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that looks really good.

321
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,110
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks really good.

322
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,332
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks really cool.

323
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:23,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me of that Ninja Gaiden remake.

324
00:24:23,514 --> 00:24:24,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

325
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:25,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Or that we've got coming.

326
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:30,501
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Monster Hunter Wilds has got a first free update.

327
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:33,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is coming out this spring.

328
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:34,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

329
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:35,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I look forward to that.

330
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:42,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, some good... I think maybe there were people going into that expecting like, oh, a new Final Fantasy or something.

331
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes people set the bar too high with that shit.

332
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in February.

333
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in February.

334
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:51,567
[SPEAKER_06]: No, wait for summer at least for something like that.

335
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, manage your expectations.

336
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want them to announce a game that's going to be five years out.

337
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:58,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

338
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:05,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't mind a teaser of the third Final Fantasy 7 remake, rebirth game though.

339
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:06,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us the title.

340
00:25:06,777 --> 00:25:12,618
[SPEAKER_06]: would be a cute thing to give because I can't imagine it's going to take years and years and years to get that game, especially if they want it to be on PS5.

341
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,219
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have it done like next year.

342
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, making games is difficult.

343
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:26,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But I liked I liked how they did Final Fantasy 16, quite honestly, because Final Fantasy 16 was out within two years, a year and a half of its unveiling.

344
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:31,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, way less of a hype line than Final Fantasy 15 was, that's for sure.

345
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

346
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:33,943
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

347
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

348
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:39,038
[SPEAKER_06]: into the things that we've been hyped about this week in our gaming weeks.

349
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And how was your gaming week?

350
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go over to DarkSakura.

351
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,219
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

352
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all right.

353
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still hurting quite a bit, so sitting down and playing isn't really easy for me.

354
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did play some Dead by Daylight, of course.

355
00:25:54,343 --> 00:25:55,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Fruit Mountain.

356
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I played my third playthrough of Dragon Age The Veilguard.

357
00:26:00,585 --> 00:26:02,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's about it for now.

358
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:04,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Polya.

359
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

360
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

361
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:07,476
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll go to Loki.

362
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:14,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Minecraft and then some more Minecraft and more Minecraft.

363
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:24,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we mainly this week has been focusing on getting ready for season four, which we just started our season four SMP server yesterday.

364
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:26,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had the kickoff yesterday.

365
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:32,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing that quite a bit, as well as just kind of walking people through the

366
00:26:32,472 --> 00:26:51,420
[SPEAKER_05]: World Tour server so we have we've had our season 3 server up for a couple weeks now and people are getting to check out everything, get to ride the rides in my theme park and all that and check out all the other builds so it's been a lot of fun to see people looking through that and then

367
00:26:53,554 --> 00:27:19,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Balotro as well I got to mess around that found out it's incredibly easy to modify since all the code is in Lua you can just open the executable like it is a zip file and just tinker away inside there it's all plain text so have at it so that was fun that didn't get me playing the game for a very long time with modified decks and whatnot so yeah

368
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was a fun distraction.

369
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:25,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, got to get Avowed for next week.

370
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:31,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the reviews on that are really good, and I'm excited to check it out when I get back from the cruise.

371
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and then maybe they'll have a post patch that fixes whatever issues people find in the first week, and it'll be in a good state of play.

372
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:44,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But I kind of heard that Avowed is like Elder Scrolls, but all killer, no filler, which I think is very interesting.

373
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I want to check it out.

374
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:49,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, my gaming week.

375
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:52,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Mostly Diablo 4, let's be real, y'all know me.

376
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:54,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working on the current season.

377
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to finish out the Battle Pass.

378
00:27:56,148 --> 00:28:04,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Oddly enough, page 5, I think it is on the Battle Pass, is kind of hard because it's a really long grind for some things that only spawn occasionally.

379
00:28:04,777 --> 00:28:32,277
[SPEAKER_06]: or you just have to get like really powerful to up the odds on on some of the seasonal mechanics I won't get too far into it but it's kind of been holding me up but I'm still really enjoying the Barbarian build I'm playing the Leapquake Barbarian they also are having a Lunar New Year event which I think ends on Tuesday so it's almost done but that was another like mini grind for a new mount so I was working on that a little bit but otherwise I'm up Paragon I think about 186 for the season which is pretty considering there's only 300 Paragon levels overall it's pretty good

380
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,598
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:28:55,894 --> 00:28:56,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Diablo 4.

382
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:01,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 and still quite a bit of No Man's Sky.

383
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I have been making progress on my No Man's Sky.

384
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I want my platinum trophy on PlayStation and I got some more golds this week to get me there.

385
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:16,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I got the gold with Aliens Met, the gold with Languages Learned, the gold with Money.

386
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I got that on stream early on.

387
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:22,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm getting some golds and I just need some of the more grindy ones.

388
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's one you have to warp like 75 times.

389
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:29,098
[SPEAKER_06]: which isn't that bad, but you know, you just have to, it's a lot.

390
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And then killing pirate ships is another one that's going to take some time too.

391
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I haven't been afraid to take on sentinels and pirate ships.

392
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a good build to let me do it.

393
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can play a little more aggressively than I usually play.

394
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: No man's sky.

395
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:41,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh,

396
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: All in the name of a stupid platinum trophy, but I want the little merit badge because I love that game so much.

397
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:51,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always talk about it on this program.

398
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:51,934
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really silly.

399
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:54,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the stupid sticker to go with it.

400
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:57,459
[SPEAKER_06]: The you did it sticker to go with it that the platinum trophy offers.

401
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much what I've been playing.

402
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:05,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, reminder, we will not be here in the next two weeks live.

403
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:09,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you'll kind of still be streaming on your own thing though, right?

404
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Likely?

405
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that I will.

406
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:25,653
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at the very least, we can do like some just chatting and do some general, you know, like what's going on in the world in the news right now and just have a thing.

407
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:29,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And Bobby Blackwolf will still be here at VOG Network for the next couple weeks.

408
00:30:29,554 --> 00:30:34,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So if y'all would still turn out and show him some love, that would be much appreciated as well.

409
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,918
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I'm excited to take a little vacation.

410
00:30:38,978 --> 00:30:40,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope y'all understand.

411
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:41,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a break.

412
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

413
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

414
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,180
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

415
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some more stories with what's going on in the news.

416
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:49,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we'll start with you.

417
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:50,583
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked a lot about PlayStation.

418
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:51,283
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only fair.

419
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,504
[SPEAKER_06]: What's Xbox doing?

420
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So Xbox is saying, well, Phil Spencer is coming out and saying, hey, you know what?

421
00:30:58,282 --> 00:31:00,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how Sony's pushing all those live series games?

422
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:03,715
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need to do that necessarily.

423
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:09,979
[SPEAKER_05]: He says he wants to see every game, or he doesn't want to see every game turn into a big live service game.

424
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, they were all games that have a beginning, middle, and an end.

425
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:24,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It was because I didn't want to see every game turn into some big live service-based game because the developer felt like that's where the business model was.

426
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not easy to do that.

427
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:29,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Not every story is told that way, and not every game...

428
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,977
[SPEAKER_05]: or Creative Idea supports that business model.

429
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:40,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's fine with just having linear games or just stuff that doesn't have to go on forever.

430
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:44,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice to hear a gaming executive that knows how to read the fucking room.

431
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:50,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Phil Spencer was not great last year with all the layoffs and everything going on.

432
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will still give credit where credit is due.

433
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:55,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's nice to hear...

434
00:31:56,995 --> 00:31:58,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he has the right perspective on this.

435
00:31:58,856 --> 00:32:06,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what I'm hearing is that's the very nice and politically correct way of saying developers need to stop shoving this shit in games where it doesn't need it.

436
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:11,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Games still can have a beginning, middle, and end and do just fine.

437
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:17,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think Avowed is probably on track to do based on all the buzz I see online.

438
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:22,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see when the sales come in, but it sounds like a lot of people are really hyped for this.

439
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:27,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, if you look at some games, it doesn't even necessarily that it has to have a beginning, middle and end.

440
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:32,158
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't need to go on forever, like being supported online because that's expensive to do.

441
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:39,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I look at games that like some of the Bethesda games like Fallout, Elder Scrolls, that type of stuff.

442
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:45,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are games that people will go back to time and time again and put hundreds of hours in.

443
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:46,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

444
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't even need a live service on there.

445
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, Bethesda tries to shove that stuff in there with paid mods.

446
00:32:53,052 --> 00:33:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: just wholly unnecessary and just a cash grab but whatever um and like you know there's Fallout 76 as well you know which uh I think that did not start off with a monthly fee and now it's not but anyways it the whole thing is that it doesn't have to be a live service game but I think that you can have success with live service if you it's done right but

447
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: most times it's not done right most of the times it doesn't really need to be there so and he also says you know for an example I love the fact we can go look at what Psychon Double Fine is working on I think like a team like Compulsion these aren't big teams and I don't want massive 1000 person teams we want them to be able to do great work and I want to create a platform that can support that and I think he's talking about Game Pass there basically saying that they're allowed to

448
00:33:46,167 --> 00:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_06]: they can spotlight those games and whatnot uh great comment from QuestBuster in our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network QuestBuster says if the game is good it will sell like Baldur's Gate 3 great example or more recently uh Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 I good call out on that title because that title was not really on my radar but I've kind of seen the buzz around that I've had friends that have picked that up and have been interested in it apparently it is it's even better than the first game um so yeah it's a good call out on that one too uh

449
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:36,369
[SPEAKER_06]: and then saying which apparently made back its production budget in a day both games have no live service components no great great yeah I and you know and I think a lot of us were observing you know I like to say I said but a lot of people said Baldur's Gate 3 was going to be a really humbling thing for a lot of the industry and it's going to really I think change the perspective of

450
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:37,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

451
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

452
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:11,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, now Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is also doing pretty well, at least, you know, at expectations, whatever that is.

453
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:15,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And since it's not Square Enix, we know they are reasonable expectations for that company.

454
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:26,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Although on a random aside note, did you hear that although Square Enix always says this didn't meet expectations, this didn't meet expectations, apparently the Dragon Quest 3...

455
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:33,396
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 HD 2D Remaster actually exceeded expectations per Square Enix.

456
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, because their expectations are flawed, and so whoever's making those expectations or setting those expectations is doing a bad job at it.

457
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:45,216
[SPEAKER_06]: They do not give the retro stuff enough credit.

458
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:48,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet Pixel Remasters exceeded expectations as well.

459
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It just took them too goddamn long to multi-platform that.

460
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,143
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's a sure guarantee.

461
00:35:55,603 --> 00:36:00,407
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see... I mean, we already know Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are supposed to be...

462
00:36:00,987 --> 00:36:02,168
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not already supposed to be out?

463
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:02,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss that?

464
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:06,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought 1 and 2 were supposed to get that same treatment pretty quickly.

465
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to come out later.

466
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:11,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was late in the year last year, but I guess not.

467
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have felt like I would have picked that up if it had happened.

468
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be later-er.

469
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:17,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Later-er.

470
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:17,996
[SPEAKER_06]: More later-er.

471
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:19,397
[SPEAKER_05]: More later-er.

472
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah so uh you know but again we've been saying this for a while what a perfect engine this you know retro remaking engine that goes back to Octopath Traveler they're all running a very similar thing Chrono Trigger hello everybody wants it it's time do it come on Square

473
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:42,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it, poke, poke, poke.

474
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:44,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I would even take Final Fantasy 6.

475
00:36:45,687 --> 00:36:46,427
[SPEAKER_06]: They just did 6.

476
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: They just did the Pixel Remaster.

477
00:36:49,067 --> 00:36:50,008
[SPEAKER_06]: They just did it.

478
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that same engine?

479
00:36:51,808 --> 00:36:53,108
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, well, I don't think it is.

480
00:36:53,468 --> 00:37:01,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the opera scene, people are like, so like the opera scene did a completely different thing than everything else the Pixel Remasters did.

481
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not what I want.

482
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,511
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um... It did not meet my expectations.

483
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:36,503
[SPEAKER_06]: but maybe what about I'm trying to get like Final Fantasy games that could still get that that haven't I don't Final Fantasy Mystic Quest no it's good I like Mystic Quest but Mystic Quest at this point would be like a $5 side game like it's just not you're not going to be able to convince people to pay for that I would like to see Final Fantasy I would like to see a 3D game turned into a 2D game hmm

484
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a 7 or 9?

485
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:42,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do 12, why not?

486
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they already did 12, they already did 10 How about 11?

487
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:50,691
[SPEAKER_05]: How about offline 11?

488
00:37:50,951 --> 00:38:02,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Final Fantasy 17 and I want it to be in pixel form Which Naoki Yoshida said could happen He said that's up to the next team That's up to the next team

489
00:38:03,627 --> 00:38:06,989
[SPEAKER_05]: If the world is upside down world that we live in, except it's not.

490
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:24,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in a world where Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations, but Dragon Quest HD, 2D, 3D, XD, LD, LOL for matching service featuring Dreams Come True did, then, you know, anything's possible.

491
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:27,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

492
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:29,986
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did Phil Spencer say?

493
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:56,884
[SPEAKER_05]: uh he said a lot of things no he basically aside from you know talking about uh Xbox and how there was you know he wanted the games with the beginning and end and all that stuff he's also uh talking about their release strategy on PlayStation 5 saying I'm not trying to move them all over to uh Xbox anymore uh essentially that you know what you know the

494
00:38:57,907 --> 00:39:01,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it makes sense they're going to put stuff on PlayStation.

495
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,991
[SPEAKER_05]: It's maybe not what I was going to say at the time.

496
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:11,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I would like to make money for all the games that we ship right now.

497
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:16,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we make more on our own platform.

498
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:19,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one reason we invest in our own platform.

499
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Or investment in our own platform is important.

500
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:22,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are...

501
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,378
[SPEAKER_05]: and many more.

502
00:39:44,236 --> 00:39:55,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's just business sense that makes sense like hey why put ourselves why lock ourselves to our own platform if we can publish some of these games on these other platforms like

503
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, is it going to make the console fanboys mad?

504
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

505
00:40:01,605 --> 00:40:03,227
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be a profitable company.

506
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:06,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather see the games available in other platforms.

507
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:10,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all the time we're talking about stuff like Final Fantasy.

508
00:40:10,655 --> 00:40:11,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect example.

509
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I wish it was on a platform that I could play it.

510
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:15,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it was on Xbox as well.

511
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I wish it came to PC right away.

512
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:18,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

513
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:19,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

514
00:40:20,524 --> 00:40:32,451
[SPEAKER_05]: These console exclusives are kind of silly, but I get it, because you're trying to sell more of your console to then get people to buy stuff through your game shop so that you make your 30% profit off of everything.

515
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to go multi-platform with some of this stuff.

516
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:42,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Nintendo could learn a lesson from that, but I doubt that they will.

517
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:43,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk crazy now.

518
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:45,778
[SPEAKER_06]: That is crazy talk, yeah.

519
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:47,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

520
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:52,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, moving on, talking about a series that y'all know I never shut up about.

521
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:59,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Diablo 4, and in shocking news, it has been confirmed that Diablo 4 is not getting an update this year.

522
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:02,730
[SPEAKER_06]: The next expansion will be in 2026.

523
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:15,561
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember that Diablo 4 got a little bit of heat because it released an expansion only a year after its initial release, and that was Vessel of Hatred, which honestly was pretty good, let's be real.

524
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it kill people with hatred?

525
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in a game?

526
00:41:19,624 --> 00:41:22,247
[SPEAKER_06]: No, to contain the hatred in a vessel.

527
00:41:22,467 --> 00:41:29,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also ended in a way that just basically screamed, we are not done yet, there is more to come, which of course there is.

528
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:30,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was surprised?

529
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:33,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody, certainly me at the front of that line.

530
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:38,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think people were a little...

531
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:40,726
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

532
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:04,065
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

533
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That at DICE 2025 that the first expansion was actually internally delayed six months because they had to move staffers to bug fixes and ongoing content.

534
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:35,125
[SPEAKER_06]: They originally wanted annual expansions, but that didn't work out.

535
00:42:35,225 --> 00:42:37,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is honestly probably for the best.

536
00:42:37,507 --> 00:42:39,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I think annual expansions would just be...

537
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:40,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot.

538
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:43,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's a lot to do in the game.

539
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this.

540
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:53,593
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I sit here and go, annual expansions, I'm like, Vessel of Hatred did add a lot to the game, and there's plenty to do in the endgame loop right now.

541
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,553
[SPEAKER_06]: The endgame's in a really good place in Diablo.

542
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:56,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I...

543
00:42:58,254 --> 00:43:02,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious what else they're going to do to extend that endgame circle in future expansions.

544
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:03,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll see.

545
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:07,680
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, for now, you get what you get for the next year.

546
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:20,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And quite frankly, as long as they keep doing the seasonal content that actually do like minor updates with these minor new mechanics, like the whole ongoing season brings in a lot of moves that are inspired by the Witch Doctor from Diablo 3.

547
00:43:21,229 --> 00:43:21,810
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have?

548
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:50,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you meant lethargic.

549
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

550
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:18,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you haven't played that Gold Master series that Digital Eclipse put out like just a year ago.

551
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:19,395
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all about him.

552
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:20,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I care more about Tempest 2000.

553
00:44:20,896 --> 00:44:21,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

554
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is in that collection.

555
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:22,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

556
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

557
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:32,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, he also did a remake for an unreleased Atari prototype, Akka-R.

558
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yay.

559
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he has his eyes turned to iRobot, which was an arcade game from 1984 and just bringing up the visuals and changing some of the original design, adding in some music, new game modes.

560
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be fun.

561
00:44:53,989 --> 00:45:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, now I also forgot that he did a Nine Inch Nails video.

562
00:45:01,411 --> 00:45:01,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

563
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:03,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

564
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:03,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

565
00:45:04,655 --> 00:45:08,958
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, it will be released in the spring.

566
00:45:09,018 --> 00:45:10,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't really have a date for it right now.

567
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:16,323
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be on the Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series.

568
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is also going to be a port for PlayStation VR 2.

569
00:45:22,725 --> 00:45:24,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be interesting, a VR port.

570
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:25,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

571
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:26,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

572
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:32,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like a VR port of this would make me sick because there's a lot going on.

573
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:32,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

574
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched the trailer and there is a lot going on in this trailer.

575
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:38,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, this is almost...

576
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:41,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much happening.

577
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, that is also, like a lot of Jeff Minter games are like this.

578
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:51,856
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, okay, so it's like kind of Amidar, but like with all of this going on.

579
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:55,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm seriously, flash warning if you're watching live right now.

580
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:58,101
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just a lot of flash stuff going on here.

581
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a lot visually.

582
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:05,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how I would feel about that in VR.

583
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:06,269
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

584
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:09,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, you know what's the equivalent of?

585
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:11,680
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the hot wing challenge for visuals.

586
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

587
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,581
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

588
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:14,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the visuals are down.

589
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:16,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But, anyway.

590
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:21,384
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Jeff Ventor's cool.

591
00:46:21,704 --> 00:46:24,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'd at least check it out, loud or not.

592
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:27,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Zapper Recharge.

593
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

594
00:46:29,107 --> 00:46:31,768
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny though, because the original game was pretty much a flop, wasn't it?

595
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:35,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was passed over.

596
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:41,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done by the guy that did Missile Command in the original Tempest, but I don't think people were really into it.

597
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:42,211
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

598
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:44,394
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on.

599
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, with an update on one of our least favorite companies.

600
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and now our favorite news is the least favorite company is that sales are down, revenues down, it's all down.

601
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:05,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably because, well, Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed and then delayed and then more delayed.

602
00:47:06,953 --> 00:47:08,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, let's talk about the numbers.

603
00:47:08,694 --> 00:47:08,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So

604
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:17,649
[SPEAKER_05]: as of uh for the nine months i guess ending at the end of the year they were down 990 million euro uh 31.4 percent over last year

605
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:32,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Down 944 million for net bookings Digital net bookings, 784 million dollars Down, was it, 33.8% And then they're back in catalog Down 27.7% at 762.3 million euro And, yeah, so, like I said

606
00:47:50,732 --> 00:48:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Assassin's Creed Shadows big contributor to that this is not surprising though to them because they were basically revised their expectations of 300 million for the period instead and it's in line with that right now they're saying though that Assassin's Creed Shadows that the pre-orders for the title are tracking solidly

607
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:47,408
[SPEAKER_05]: early previews have been positive praising it's narrative and immersive experience not what I've seen it says well both characters playing critical roles in the game storyline also not what I've seen as far as reviews go basically all the good gameplay is with the female ninja in there and that the samurai gameplay is crap because it's nothing like Assassin's Creed it's just you know most of the abilities are locked behind her um

608
00:48:49,341 --> 00:48:53,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and then, of course, you know, then they go to praise the Assassin's Creed team.

609
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

610
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:05,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, apparently, they have recorded 36 million monthly active users across consoles and PC, and these are up by 4-7%.

611
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:05,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Also,

612
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:14,488
[SPEAKER_05]: that the numbers for the what was it called?

613
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: The Crew Motor Fest are higher.

614
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably because you shut the servers down for the other ones.

615
00:49:20,753 --> 00:49:24,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Rising, I guess, 38% year over year.

616
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:31,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think sales too on those titles kind of attributed to that as well.

617
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:38,568
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of focus on Shadows doing well.

618
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:41,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last good game they put out was Avatar.

619
00:49:41,486 --> 00:49:42,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That was really good.

620
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:08,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Some comments from our chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

621
00:50:08,245 --> 00:50:11,908
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100Matt says, I want the live service game where Yves sells the company.

622
00:50:12,308 --> 00:50:14,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd get the day one edition ultimate season pass of that.

623
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:16,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there with you.

624
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:20,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster says, Ubisoft suffered a lot of self-inflicted wounds.

625
00:50:20,774 --> 00:50:22,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Skull and bones flopped.

626
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:22,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

627
00:50:22,616 --> 00:50:24,057
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Defiant is shutting down this year.

628
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:26,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost Crown and Outlaws apparently underperformed.

629
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Division spinoff was cancelled because the company is being led poorly.

630
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They're forcing them to do things with these games.

631
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:40,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the exact opposite of what Phil Spencer is saying in that earlier story about not everything needs to be a live story game.

632
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:45,187
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Yves Gamon the one setting those expectations so high.

633
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a triple, it's a quadruple A game.

634
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:51,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth this $80 price point or whatever and it's like

635
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:54,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crap.

636
00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:06,339
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rush crap that has fewer features than a game you released many, many years ago that the ship combat and stuff was just a part of the game.

637
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:07,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't even the whole game.

638
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:17,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, how did you screw up a game that you had already kind of nailed, basically saying, hey, just take Assassin's Creed out of it and just make it all the pirate stuff, and then you got a gold game.

639
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:21,732
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, hold on, let's see what we can monetize on this crap.

640
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:48,564
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it flopped and then your X-Defiant thing flopped as well and it's like well hmm could it be because all this live service crap that you're trying to shovel into it and rush these games out and like hype them up with like saying oh we're gonna charge more for it because it's a quality game yeah okay well when you set the expectations way up here and your game comes out as absolute dog shit then people are gonna be pissed off in you know

641
00:51:49,284 --> 00:51:50,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Rightfully not going to purchase it.

642
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:58,208
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to watch all the reviews just trashing it and they're going to hear the reviewers going, yeah, it's a AAA or quadruple A game.

643
00:51:58,708 --> 00:51:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo.

644
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:01,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just, it's

645
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:09,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pure, like, he just doesn't understand or doesn't care about his customer base.

646
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:15,344
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just throwing out buzzwords for the investors because the investors hear, ooh, it's going to be a really big game.

647
00:52:15,524 --> 00:52:24,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember, when he's talking about quadruple A games and the $80 price point and stuff like that and how their games are worth that, he's not talking to you, the customer.

648
00:52:24,548 --> 00:52:25,308
[SPEAKER_05]: He's talking to you.

649
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:49,391
[SPEAKER_05]: the investors because he's trying to hype them up to get them to buy the stock at a higher price that's really the whole pitch here it's not about convincing the consumer to purchase their game because frankly no one's really paying attention to those press releases where he's talking about that your average consumer they're like ooh pirate game cool go play it yeah I don't know it's just

650
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:53,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

651
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:54,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

652
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:22,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess as long as they make money, but at what expense?

653
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:32,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on and talk about if you want to run your own kingdom, you could check out Civilization 7 or CivSev, which is out right now.

654
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:38,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, as much as I love Civ, the original Civilization is probably one of my favorite video games of all time, really.

655
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:40,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get CivSev.

656
00:53:41,141 --> 00:53:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you why I didn't get Civ 7 this week.

657
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:46,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, I've been busy and can't really invest those type of hours.

658
00:53:47,146 --> 00:54:02,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, it's very obvious that there is a pattern with the last couple Civ games that is continuing with Civilization 7 that there will be DLC that comes out for the game that is essentially going to be mandatory, meaning it changes game mechanics.

659
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:04,841
[SPEAKER_06]: It adds things to the game that will change...

660
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The experience of the game.

661
00:54:07,022 --> 00:54:12,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, I'm kind of like at this point where I'm just like sick and tired and I feel the exact same way about Mortal Kombat.

662
00:54:12,506 --> 00:54:13,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the exact same thing.

663
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:21,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just sick and tired of these games that are purposely coming out with like the how we are going to suck away your money over a five year plan.

664
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:32,400
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and it goes back to the whole Baldur's Gate 3 argument that like release the game in a finished state with everything you want in one package the first time for 70 bucks if you're going to charge 70 bucks.

665
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:40,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's very obvious there are holes that are going to be filled in with Civilization VII in expansions.

666
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:42,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just kind of like, you know what, maybe I can wait.

667
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:46,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll get suckered into a sale later on, but it probably won't be for a while.

668
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:50,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think the earliest this game is going to go on sale is maybe like 4th of July sales.

669
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:52,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a little bit wishful thinking.

670
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:55,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

671
00:54:55,570 --> 00:55:01,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But sure enough, potential DLC has already been data mined out of Civilization.

672
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:09,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to folks on Reddit who were looking at the asset cloud file in Civilization 7, they found new civilizations.

673
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:10,399
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also very common.

674
00:55:10,439 --> 00:55:12,140
[SPEAKER_06]: They release new civs you can play as.

675
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:19,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually this part doesn't bother me as much because I track this as cosmetics, you know, take them or leave them.

676
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,088
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't fundamentally necessarily change the game.

677
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:26,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Ottomans, Maori, Tonga, Iceland and the Pirate Republic.

678
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:26,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

679
00:55:27,332 --> 00:55:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Bjork the leader of Iceland?

680
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:29,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

681
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:31,836
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, I'm going to make her.

682
00:55:31,956 --> 00:55:34,338
[SPEAKER_06]: But well, this and Civ 7 kind of mixes it up.

683
00:55:35,078 --> 00:55:40,322
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be a leader from one civilization over another.

684
00:55:40,442 --> 00:55:42,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not tied to just one.

685
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:43,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of interesting.

686
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

687
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:47,307
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may interject.

688
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:47,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go for it.

689
00:55:48,522 --> 00:55:56,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that the voices actually speak as close to the period correct version of their language as possible.

690
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:58,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do go out of their way to make it authentic.

691
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:03,331
[SPEAKER_06]: In a weird way, I feel bad for my stance, but I don't.

692
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:09,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the worst parts of gaming business right now that I'm just kind of like, you know what?

693
00:56:09,875 --> 00:56:17,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to buy this game just to have it sit in my backlog right now when I don't really have the hours to invest in it, especially knowing I'm not really playing the final game.

694
00:56:19,048 --> 00:56:21,851
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other people, though, who are just like, I need it now.

695
00:56:22,072 --> 00:56:22,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's fine.

696
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:28,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not here to tell anybody else how to spend their money, but I can choose how to spend mine.

697
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:40,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, now also important with this is that there is a whole new so what they mined out of this a new wonders pack that apparently is focused on Asian content.

698
00:56:40,495 --> 00:56:49,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe like different sets of wonders that are, you know, more focused on some of the big things that are built in other continents is what I'm left to draw from that.

699
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,145
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, this is a huge one, a whole new Atomic Age.

700
00:56:54,586 --> 00:57:01,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So ages are a big thing in this game, and right now in the game you go to the Antiquity Age, the Exploration Age, and the Modern Age.

701
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:07,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently there is an Atomic Age that's supposed to follow that, that was datamined out of that, and that makes a lot of sense.

702
00:57:08,784 --> 00:57:09,846
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

703
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:32,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sort of dips its toes in the Cold War, like you've identified with the thermonuclear device being the one that ends the military victory path there.

704
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:50,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Dennis Shirk, executive producer, added, You can imagine the possibilities with this, honestly, and this isn't a comment about the Fourth Age, the way that the design team set it up so that each age is chock full of systems, visuals, units, sieves, all specific to that age and what you could do with that and where you could take it.

705
00:57:50,461 --> 00:57:52,203
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

706
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:15,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played Mortal Kombat 1.

707
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:24,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, besides the whole it's gross thing, playing Ghostface is actually a lot of fun because my friend has it and downloaded them.

708
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I don't care what my friends spend their money on, but I'm over it.

709
00:58:29,194 --> 00:58:31,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

710
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:38,140
[SPEAKER_06]: SG100 Matt in chat says, this is what bothers me is when companies say gamers are the problem because they don't get things day one anymore.

711
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:39,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

712
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting wise to your antics, folks.

713
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:45,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, DarkSakura.

714
00:58:47,242 --> 00:59:00,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another game that was addressed in the state of play that I probably won't be getting is a version of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.

715
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:04,218
[SPEAKER_02]: They're calling it Metal Gear Solid Delta, which is kind of stupid because it's the third game.

716
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So shouldn't it be Gamma?

717
00:59:09,602 --> 00:59:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's because Delta's a triangle.

718
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:14,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my... I think that's where it is, yeah.

719
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:23,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it is a remastered version of Snake Eater.

720
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:38,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that's going to be happening is since the Ape Escape minigame thing was a PlayStation and Steam thing, they're doing Bomberman.

721
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:42,486
[SPEAKER_02]: for their little mini game thing.

722
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:49,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had like a snake versus monkey, which means you had to capture the ape escape monkeys.

723
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,731
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess you're going to be playing Bomberman with snake.

724
00:59:52,531 --> 00:59:52,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

725
00:59:53,908 --> 00:59:54,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

726
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:55,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense for Konami.

727
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:57,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't in any of the other HD versions.

728
00:59:58,032 --> 01:00:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially on a platform like Microsoft where it does not make maybe as much sense.

729
01:00:03,336 --> 01:00:03,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

730
01:00:03,797 --> 01:00:09,962
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just saying that it would make sense that Konami leads on its own archive, you know, where Bomberman would be.

731
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bomberman's a cute game.

732
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:11,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

733
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:19,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, except for that one, you know, gritty Bomberman version they tried to do on the Xbox back in the day that nobody likes sitting on.

734
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:22,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Bomberman Zero, oh god.

735
01:00:22,637 --> 01:00:26,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it makes me very uncomfortable.

736
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,801
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a choice.

737
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the Mega Man that they were going to do in that style too?

738
01:00:32,851 --> 01:00:35,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that looked like the box art for Mega Man 1?

739
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:36,753
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

740
01:00:36,873 --> 01:00:40,255
[SPEAKER_05]: They were going to do one that was in the style of Bomberman Act Zero.

741
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:43,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a super edgy Mega Man or something.

742
01:00:43,316 --> 01:00:43,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Look it up.

743
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget what the title was called, but Capcom scrapped it, obviously.

744
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,940
[SPEAKER_02]: The edgiest he ever needed to get was X. End of story.

745
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:52,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

746
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:55,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Rockman X.

747
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's time for a new Mega Man, by the way.

748
01:00:59,941 --> 01:01:02,521
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone gets this game in August, just let me know.

749
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll watch it on Twitch or something.

750
01:01:04,742 --> 01:01:05,322
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

751
01:01:06,602 --> 01:01:09,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well maybe there'll be no consoles to play it on, right, Loki?

752
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

753
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:20,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you want a new Mega Man, I recommend checking out Season 2 of Channel 64 on my channel, where I created a whole new set of Robot Masters themed around Minecraft characters.

754
01:01:21,325 --> 01:01:21,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap plug.

755
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Just call this show an outlet, because you're putting a plug in.

756
01:01:27,127 --> 01:01:39,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this is going to come to a shock to nobody, but did you know that there are fewer younger buyers of consoles in the U.S.? ?

757
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:45,787
[SPEAKER_05]: and that it's just the demographic of older people buying consoles.

758
01:01:46,188 --> 01:01:51,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be because consoles are getting more expensive and everybody is making less and less money at their job?

759
01:01:51,893 --> 01:01:57,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it be that younger buyers are subject to predatory student loans and therefore don't have as much income?

760
01:01:57,899 --> 01:01:59,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be the reason?

761
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:03,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be that you can do more with a computer?

762
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: or a phone.

763
01:02:06,701 --> 01:02:09,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's that a lot of people game on their phones at this point.

764
01:02:10,742 --> 01:02:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Shock to no one, high-income households are becoming the biggest part of U.S.

765
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:25,486
[SPEAKER_05]: console hardware market as 49% of the country's game console buyers during the fourth quarter of 2024 have a household income of at least $100,000 per year.

766
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:35,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because that's the only way you're going to afford those $500 consoles and those $70 games and those $80 quadruple A games.

767
01:02:37,568 --> 01:02:41,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Also saying that this is a record high beating the 48% seen in the fourth quarter of 2021.

768
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:48,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Gee, I wonder what was going on in 2021 that would cause console sales to go up.

769
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:56,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's as if people couldn't go out and spend their money in places and so they had extra income to, I don't know, purchase things that they could do at home.

770
01:02:57,193 --> 01:02:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Such a novel concept.

771
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:01,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, all the things we're learning from data.

772
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:09,701
[SPEAKER_05]: During the first quarter of 2020 as well, this group accounted for only 29% of video game hardware.

773
01:03:10,021 --> 01:03:14,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, what was not going on in the first quarter of 2020, you say?

774
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be a giant pandemic wasn't going on?

775
01:03:18,246 --> 01:03:20,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, my God, could we just, like...

776
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,681
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the biggest duh I've ever seen, you know, as far as analysts go.

777
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:33,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the demographic age 45 and above accounted for 45% of the purchases in the US console market.

778
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:39,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, because it's parents probably purchasing it for their kids because they can only have one console for the household.

779
01:03:39,504 --> 01:03:46,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the younger kids in the family are not going to be able to afford this $500 console.

780
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:49,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That is going to take lots of money.

781
01:03:49,387 --> 01:03:50,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not a thing.

782
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:50,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

783
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:57,104
[SPEAKER_06]: As Joe and Hunter Matt pointing out, minimum wage still at $7.25 since we were buying consoles in the early 2000s.

784
01:03:58,004 --> 01:03:58,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

785
01:03:59,105 --> 01:03:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Facts.

786
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:00,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

787
01:04:00,526 --> 01:04:01,846
[SPEAKER_06]: We hate to see true facts.

788
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, this is the biggest, like, duh.

789
01:04:07,189 --> 01:04:07,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I get it.

790
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:09,090
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, thing.

791
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, cool.

792
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:15,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, MPD, for sharing this crazy data that is completely not...

793
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,831
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would be even wilder?

794
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:28,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't, Loki, we put tariffs on countries for really silly political reasons that make no sense.

795
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:32,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's drive up the price of these consoles even further and see what happens.

796
01:04:33,732 --> 01:04:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost as if I don't know what tariffs are, and so I say, well, it worked 200 years ago, it's probably gonna work today, right?

797
01:04:41,896 --> 01:04:42,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's changed in the world.

798
01:04:42,736 --> 01:04:44,817
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean no one's buying a steam engine anymore?

799
01:04:45,497 --> 01:04:46,058
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

800
01:04:46,238 --> 01:04:48,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had tariffs and no taxes?

801
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:53,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so weird that that, like, it's like, it's the same, it's like, who do you think pays those tariffs?

802
01:04:53,921 --> 01:04:55,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, magic elves?

803
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the Keebler elves.

804
01:04:58,915 --> 01:05:00,796
[SPEAKER_05]: The other countries are paying those tariffs.

805
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:01,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll show them.

806
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:02,876
[SPEAKER_02]: They could pay everything in cookies.

807
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:05,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're like, we'll just charge you right back.

808
01:05:05,637 --> 01:05:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, wait, no, not like that.

809
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have people that are elected into office.

810
01:05:10,779 --> 01:05:12,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the tangent we're going on here.

811
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,060
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the dumbest fucking ideas.

812
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, hey, let's name Greenland Red, White, and Blue Land.

813
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,881
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you go fuck yourself?

814
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:21,762
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you go fuck yourself instead?

815
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:29,825
[SPEAKER_02]: or let's fire all of the people that make our air navigation and transportation systems.

816
01:05:30,926 --> 01:05:36,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire all the people who keep it safe and then have a plane crash every three days.

817
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:38,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire all the people in charge of the nuclear arsenal.

818
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

819
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,611
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one I was going for too.

820
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:47,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Or give a certain asshole in tech access to everybody's IRS records.

821
01:05:47,373 --> 01:05:49,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one that just came up on my radar yesterday.

822
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:50,554
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole world...

823
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,101
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole United States is going to shit, so that's fine.

824
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:59,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, buy consoles because, you know, consume.

825
01:06:01,864 --> 01:06:02,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

826
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:03,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Be more distracted.

827
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be more distracted through all of this stuff and spend the money on it so that we're happy and you're not paying attention to the real shit going on in the world.

828
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:22,151
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100 Matt in chat with a real good point saying at least... That was disproven.

829
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:23,832
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say that?

830
01:06:24,432 --> 01:06:25,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was audio of it out there.

831
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:30,276
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not said to the turd in question.

832
01:06:31,296 --> 01:06:32,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Snopes got a hold of that.

833
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:32,997
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

834
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's on Snopes, I won't read it.

835
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:34,558
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

836
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:37,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

837
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:41,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We got one more that this is facts talking about Overwatch 2.

838
01:06:42,317 --> 01:06:48,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've been very curious where Overwatch 2 is going to go in light of Marvel Rivals and all the things that have been happening over there.

839
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:51,951
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of the question is your move, Overwatch.

840
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,712
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to do?

841
01:06:53,192 --> 01:07:01,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And as it turns out, yeah, Overwatch I think is feeling the heat a little bit, and they are doing a lot for Season 15 with the big update.

842
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:06,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be a whole new perks system that's going to be introduced.

843
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:13,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So perks will – during a match, you get two opportunities to pick a perk for your hero.

844
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:16,891
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds very similar to the way like a League of Legends or a –

845
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:20,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Lane Game would play.

846
01:07:21,153 --> 01:07:22,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of interesting.

847
01:07:23,254 --> 01:07:26,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the return of loot box rewards.

848
01:07:26,496 --> 01:07:27,396
[SPEAKER_06]: This is huge.

849
01:07:28,317 --> 01:07:30,558
[SPEAKER_06]: They have decided that loot boxes will be returning.

850
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:32,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be another way to get the cosmetics in the game.

851
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:36,120
[SPEAKER_06]: You get loot boxes from doing weekly and event rewards.

852
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,803
[SPEAKER_06]: You get one legendary loot box for having the free battle pass or two if you have the premium battle pass.

853
01:07:43,604 --> 01:07:45,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be publishing drop rates for boxes.

854
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:55,180
[SPEAKER_06]: and Blizzard Guarantees a rare or better item will drop in every single box with an epic item within 5 consecutive boxes and a legendary item within 20.

855
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to buy them?

856
01:07:58,461 --> 01:08:06,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's said that they are because I think this is being added on top of the current system not instead of it.

857
01:08:07,054 --> 01:08:30,542
[SPEAKER_06]: so it will be like you can get your cosmetics this way or this way so I would assume that loot boxes will be for sale but I don't know how much or any of that at this time so but people are actually thrilled that loot boxes are coming back I mean and I can see when it's side by side with the other line with the other way what?

858
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, that's a headline.

859
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:32,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.

860
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,062
[SPEAKER_05]: They're thrilled that loot boxes are coming back.

861
01:08:35,122 --> 01:08:36,362
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they apparently are.

862
01:08:36,462 --> 01:08:37,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that you said that.

863
01:08:37,703 --> 01:08:37,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

864
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:39,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that you said that.

865
01:08:39,964 --> 01:08:40,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

866
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:40,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

867
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:46,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to earn them through in-game stuff and getting cosmetics for things you do, it does give you something to work towards in-game.

868
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's the most terrible thing in the world.

869
01:08:48,947 --> 01:08:49,788
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I agree.

870
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:53,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree in the sense of, like, you know, earn through game.

871
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,331
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it really going to stay there?

872
01:08:58,351 --> 01:08:58,391
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

873
01:08:58,491 --> 01:08:59,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask yourself.

874
01:08:59,151 --> 01:08:59,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Search in your soul.

875
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:05,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to resist the temptation from making more money?

876
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Would they possibly leave money on the table?

877
01:09:09,794 --> 01:09:11,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck no, they're not going to leave money on the table.

878
01:09:13,436 --> 01:09:14,836
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also interesting as well.

879
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:24,480
[SPEAKER_06]: In Season 16, so this is later down the road because 15 is coming, and then in 16, Overwatch 2 will get a new stadium game mode.

880
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,980
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

881
01:09:45,646 --> 01:09:46,907
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

882
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Season 15 launches on Tuesday.

883
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:19,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to see some of those overhauls pretty quick.

884
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:21,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the competition is very good.

885
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:26,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that Blizzard's being needled a little bit here with Marvel Rivals and its success.

886
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:31,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that Marvel Rivals is a perfect game, but I think people just kind of appreciate the change of pace right now.

887
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But it'll be interesting to see what Overwatch 2 sort of

888
01:10:35,342 --> 01:10:38,904
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, disrupting a little bit is going to do to the scene.

889
01:10:38,964 --> 01:10:41,166
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I love it in the MMO space.

890
01:10:41,206 --> 01:10:44,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV needled WoW and now it's going the other way.

891
01:10:44,228 --> 01:10:46,069
[SPEAKER_06]: WoW is needling Final Fantasy XIV.

892
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great and there's room for both.

893
01:10:48,851 --> 01:10:50,832
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can play more than one video game in your life.

894
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see what continues with this.

895
01:10:55,015 --> 01:11:00,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's go back to a simpler time when there were no seasons in video games.

896
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:02,760
[SPEAKER_06]: One and done.

897
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's roll the bumper.

898
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:22,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

899
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:25,417
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

900
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:30,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I accidentally let the Neo Geo noise through so they know it's going to be that.

901
01:11:30,579 --> 01:11:32,740
[SPEAKER_06]: But what did you pick for tonight's game, DarkSakura?

902
01:11:33,749 --> 01:12:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: the game I picked is Puzzle de Pon it is a puzzle game that was made by VSCO Corporation came out in 1995 and released for Neo Geo Arcade the name the pon comes from the sound it's sort of like a Japanese onomatopoeia saying pon is the sound of something popping or breaking I play the crap out of this when I used to work at the pizza place I play the crap out of this

903
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle de Pon actually plays very similarly to Puzzle Bobble, or as we got it, Bust a Move.

904
01:12:10,513 --> 01:12:13,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And the actual concept of the game was licensed from Taito.

905
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:17,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some big differences, however.

906
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:20,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to clear all the balls on the screen.

907
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to get this little panel in the center.

908
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:49,684
[SPEAKER_02]: to be released by the balls to get it to let go and so once the shape or the drop token is released then you move on to the next level you do also have a time limit to do that in and of course if you don't manage to bust enough balls before it hits that bottom line then of course you also lose there yeah I said it

909
01:12:50,805 --> 01:13:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: so there are 39 levels in the game divided into groups of three the first two it's generic third level you start getting a zodiac sign level 39 is the sun sign and once you beat the game you become the sun god and you ride across the earth in your sun chariot and you're suddenly a blonde and some of the levels though from this actually went on to be adopted into the puzzle bobble games

910
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:44,649
[SPEAKER_02]: and so, you know, the game had a sequel in 1997 that came out on Neo Geo MVS was Puzzle Depon R and it's the same concept but different stages and really, that's it I think, did this not get a release in the Neo Geo Museum series?

911
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:47,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it did.

912
01:13:48,427 --> 01:13:55,952
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate, or like in one of the Neo Geo re-releases, I don't recall this having an MBS release.

913
01:13:56,813 --> 01:14:03,158
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Mike, you become, I'm sorry, Bones, you become Apollo who would ride across the sky in a chariot.

914
01:14:04,759 --> 01:14:05,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think so.

915
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

916
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:09,183
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different Zodiac.

917
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:10,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate.

918
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: um the game is uh is uh that's it really i it was a one shot it's a fun game and if you haven't played it fix that it's it's puzzle bobble but not it's addicting yeah it's fun all right plus i love that you pop the bubble and it just goes boom

919
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,082
[SPEAKER_06]: We love sound effects and that whole thing.

920
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the onomatopoeia.

921
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:45,986
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a fun word to say as well.

922
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:47,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up there with undulate.

923
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:51,710
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, we're actually kind of done with news tonight.

924
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,691
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have a few more segments for you.

925

[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see if you all want to call in.

926

[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have a couple emails tonight, which is great.

927
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:02,716
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we get to that, we want to cover the release dates as we always do.

928
01:15:02,816 --> 01:15:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go to the US with Loki and check out the release dates.

929

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sounds like the Earth Defense Force World Heroes, you know, how it was done in that kind of...

938
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:50,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh gosh, what was the, uh, there was another voxel, like, kind of Zelda-type game where you can get this extremely large sword.

944
01:16:19,002 --> 01:16:25,404

[SPEAKER_05]: There's no gun dogs.

946

[SPEAKER_02]: Also, PGA Tour 2K25 on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, RPG Maker With for PlayStation.

970
01:18:58,447 --> 01:18:58,888
[SPEAKER_01]: with what?

971
01:18:58,928 --> 01:18:59,388
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.

972
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the same day we have Sonic Racing Crossworlds on Damn Near Everything and Whisker Squadron Survivor for PlayStation.

973
01:19:09,731 --> 01:19:10,071
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

974
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:13,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on.

975
01:19:14,352 --> 01:19:16,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are done with our stories.

976
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:20,234
[SPEAKER_06]: But I believe we have some folks that sent us emails this week.

977
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:21,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can send us emails as well.

978
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails.

979
01:19:24,815 --> 01:19:30,417
[SPEAKER_06]: We also encourage you to participate through our Discord channel throughout the week at VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.

980
01:19:30,837 --> 01:19:36,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have our Blue Sky at OrangeLawnTrader.com is where you can follow us on Blue Sky.

981
01:19:36,978 --> 01:19:38,559
[SPEAKER_06]: But emails, DarkSakura.

982
01:19:40,177 --> 01:19:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one comes from Net Zero.

983
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, OLR crew.

984
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the show.

985
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,561
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your Nintendo Switch 2 price predictions?

986
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:54,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I predict $600, but $500 if we're lucky.

987
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:54,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

988
01:19:54,762 --> 01:19:55,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Love, Sam.

989
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:56,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Sam.

990
01:19:59,984 --> 01:20:01,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to actually lowball it and say $450.

991
01:20:01,445 --> 01:20:01,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

992
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We had got into this a little bit because I remember the tariff thing was a big discussion that same week.

993
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm still sticking with my whole, if the tariffs are a concern and mess things up, I believe Nintendo will bundle in Mario Kart 9 to absorb the cost, and therefore the system will cost $480, maybe even as high as $500, but I think that's about as high as it could possibly go with a bundled game.

994
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:28,984
[SPEAKER_06]: If they...

995
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:33,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the interesting thing is, I think you're going to be paying $500 either way.

996
01:20:33,525 --> 01:20:36,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, is Nintendo going to eat the cost of Mario Kart 9 or not?

997
01:20:36,546 --> 01:20:42,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think the other way is, the console will probably be $400, and then the game will cost you another $80.

998
01:20:42,808 --> 01:20:47,990
[SPEAKER_06]: But I sort of am like, I feel like everybody's going to get Mario Kart 9, but not everybody.

999
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,371
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe some people are getting it to play upgraded versions of their old Switch games.

1000
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:55,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming that is a thing, I'm going out on a limb.

1001
01:20:56,735 --> 01:20:58,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Or other things that release on it.

1002
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:04,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I'm sticking to $400 for this system by itself, $480 if tariffs get fucky.

1003
01:21:04,982 --> 01:21:05,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what about you?

1004
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it goes over $349.

1005
01:21:09,426 --> 01:21:12,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, you're coming a little lower.

1006
01:21:12,469 --> 01:21:12,809
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1007
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:14,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1008
01:21:14,591 --> 01:21:15,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe $399, but it won't go over $400.

1009
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:15,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1010
01:21:20,103 --> 01:21:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when I say 400, I mean 399.

1011
01:21:22,304 --> 01:21:22,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

1012
01:21:22,864 --> 01:21:23,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 400.

1013
01:21:23,105 --> 01:21:25,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1014
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

1015
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:28,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the email and the question.

1016
01:21:30,568 --> 01:21:30,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there another?

1017
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:32,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1018
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:37,492
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it started off with Jamie Rocks, so it's already my favorite email so far.

1019
01:21:37,512 --> 01:21:39,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, somebody knowing how to get read on air.

1020
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:39,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1021
01:21:41,158 --> 01:22:10,272
[SPEAKER_02]: kudos to Jamie, DarkSakura, Summers thank you, I don't know what I did though out of genuinely morbid curiosity, are there any major furry slash animal character based drag queens, not counting of course fursuiters outside the drag community with characters of I don't like the word opposite gender with characters of a different gender is what I will say and I assume Sigourney Beaver doesn't count, that comes from Robert M there are no opposite genders there are just multiple genders, there's no opposites when many exist

1022
01:22:11,263 --> 01:22:20,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to talk about Brenda Banks, who used to be called Benchilla back in the day, was a drag queen furry.

1023
01:22:20,847 --> 01:22:37,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Arrietty counts, because Don, I think Don did a lot of, I don't know if Don counts as a furry, but Don did a lot of animal-based outfits.

1024
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:40,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my kind of counterpoint.

1025
01:22:42,221 --> 01:22:43,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Furry conventions are a thing.

1026
01:22:44,283 --> 01:22:45,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Great for those that are into the community.

1027
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:56,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I understand, usually these furry conventions, there will be the equivalent of what you would see as an anime expo that would do like the show, the – what do they call it?

1028
01:22:56,414 --> 01:22:56,554
[SPEAKER_06]: The –

1029
01:22:57,878 --> 01:22:58,638
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1030
01:23:14,486 --> 01:23:16,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that drag of some sort?

1031
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:27,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I mean, if you kind of go by the old RuPaul adage, and yes, I know grandma's got issues sometimes, but I do tend to prescribe to the whole you're born naked and the rest is drag sort of thing.

1032
01:23:27,913 --> 01:23:37,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And if furry is how you choose to sort of represent yourself in your, you know, nightlife or when you're around your chosen family and stuff, isn't that kind of drag?

1033
01:23:38,098 --> 01:23:39,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not a negative thing at all.

1034
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:41,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking it as how they self-identify.

1035
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:42,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1036
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:42,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1037
01:23:43,863 --> 01:23:47,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you identify as a drag queen and a furry?

1038
01:23:48,084 --> 01:23:51,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a drag queen who does animal-based things?

1039
01:23:51,285 --> 01:23:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you mean.

1040
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:54,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there somebody out there who does claim both that we know of?

1041
01:23:55,026 --> 01:23:55,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of any.

1042
01:23:55,646 --> 01:23:56,907
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I brought up who I brought up.

1043
01:23:56,987 --> 01:23:58,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I don't know of any.

1044
01:23:59,327 --> 01:24:01,508
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that Dawn counted.

1045
01:24:03,648 --> 01:24:09,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of have a feeling that Arrietty might, but it's a very animal-based makeup.

1046
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Several of the drag performers that have been on Dragula would consider themselves drag monsters, which is not quite furry, but it's getting there.

1047
01:24:20,524 --> 01:24:22,445
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, think a little more Alien and Predator.

1048
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:29,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, you know, if you like your furry things to bite, you might see that with those performers.

1049
01:24:29,927 --> 01:24:31,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1050
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:35,209
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1051
01:24:59,016 --> 01:25:01,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's presentation.

1052
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:04,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at it as the same thing.

1053
01:25:05,619 --> 01:25:17,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and I'll admit, and I think I'm a bit... I mean, there's a lot of me in this, of course, but I think that I get a little bit different when I'm on the show versus how I am outside.

1054
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:24,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm kind of a... I will talk to you in the grocery store line, but otherwise, don't look at me.

1055
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:25,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very much an ambivert.

1056
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's I think we all but I mean also being autistic I mask a lot I have to to be able to to make it anywhere and I think that we all have the masks that we wear sure depending on our situation I don't like to think of that in technical terms as drag you know but I think that every I think drag is a mask

1057
01:25:56,781 --> 01:26:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that everyone has these personas that they display situationally or fursona as the case may be

1058
01:26:07,557 --> 01:26:12,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but I believe that it was, I always mispronounce his name, Deepak Chopra?

1059
01:26:13,618 --> 01:26:36,122
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that in one of his books he discussed having the true self, the truest self is the self on the inside and that the outer that is your permanent self is the true self on the inside and your self on the outside is the constantly changing self I know we're getting into philosophy but

1060
01:26:37,651 --> 01:27:04,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that as a very real thing we all do it not necessarily that we're you know for some of us who are literally masking these aspects of our personality but for some people it's like a switch even happens in language I'm sure you know of code switching right oh yeah so we all it's a human thing unfortunately a lot of gay guys have to do it at their job and all sorts of people on the LGBTQIA rainbow but they they have to do that at their day jobs

1061
01:27:05,799 --> 01:27:17,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine what it's like hanging around with a bunch of thirsty bitches talking about wanting to get in somebody else's pants and being the person there is like... Gross?

1062
01:27:19,945 --> 01:27:27,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I did think of, you know, my favorite furry drag performer would be when Loki wore the little Big Planet costume to the show.

1063
01:27:28,568 --> 01:27:31,429
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki is my favorite furry drag performer.

1064
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:34,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you see this...

1065
01:27:35,994 --> 01:27:37,683
[SPEAKER_02]: My little VTuber?

1066
01:27:37,924 --> 01:27:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

1067
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:39,833
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a ferret!

1068
01:27:41,721 --> 01:27:44,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Your VTuber is kind of a form of drag in a way.

1069
01:27:44,382 --> 01:27:46,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but I get what you're talking.

1070
01:27:46,923 --> 01:27:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: You're equating it to like the masks.

1071
01:27:48,383 --> 01:27:49,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the mask thing.

1072
01:27:49,303 --> 01:27:50,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just saying, eh, it's all drag.

1073
01:27:50,244 --> 01:27:52,544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is literally me not wanting to put on makeup anymore.

1074
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,366
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like, I'm going to sit around.

1075
01:27:56,986 --> 01:27:58,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell y'all what I'm wearing right now.

1076
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I am wearing my Trash Panda onesie.

1077
01:28:02,228 --> 01:28:03,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fucking comfortable.

1078
01:28:03,688 --> 01:28:04,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl, what are you wearing?

1079
01:28:04,588 --> 01:28:05,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not wearing makeup.

1080
01:28:05,769 --> 01:28:06,989
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you wearing right now?

1081
01:28:07,409 --> 01:28:08,390
[SPEAKER_06]: This is real hot.

1082
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me what you're wearing.

1083
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually pretty warm because this thing is made out of very thick fleece.

1084
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:17,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wearing a t-shirt, jammies, and no bra.

1085
01:28:18,747 --> 01:28:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1086
01:28:19,608 --> 01:28:20,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Fact.

1087
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I will freely admit I ain't wearing a bra.

1088
01:28:23,591 --> 01:28:46,258
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know anyone who don't like it, you don't get to say anything about what the fuck I'm wearing, so fuck off I know enough lady friends that know exactly what happens if there is no company expected the first thing that happens when you walk in the door when you get home from work, the one-handed removal the slingshot, the bra slingshot and also I found not too long ago how to literally use your bra as a slingshot as a survival tool

1089
01:28:48,084 --> 01:28:50,466
[SPEAKER_02]: A little fact about y'all.

1090
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said this before.

1091
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm into the whole survival thing.

1092
01:28:54,488 --> 01:28:57,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a survival kit in my... I have an axe in my car.

1093
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:01,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thinking about you going... I have fire starters.

1094
01:29:02,093 --> 01:29:03,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Thinking about you going on Survivor.

1095
01:29:06,036 --> 01:29:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm thinking of me when the collapse of humanity happens and the EMP wipes out all electronics.

1096
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be okay.

1097
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1098
01:29:16,424 --> 01:29:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually a personal real fear of mine that I will be caught in a situation where I have to fend for myself and so the way that I manage this maybe unreasonable fear is I teach myself actual survival skills and I have a survival kit in my car so if anything is gonna happen I got you

1099
01:29:41,161 --> 01:29:42,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I also planned for the zombie apocalypse.

1100
01:29:42,902 --> 01:29:47,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, we're trying not to have The Last of Us happen for real, but you know.

1101
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:52,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But what was that sports place out in, was it in Carmichael, Orangevale?

1102
01:29:53,246 --> 01:29:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone now, but it was just a big brick building.

1103
01:29:56,868 --> 01:29:59,028
[SPEAKER_02]: That place would have been the perfect zombie apocalypse place.

1104
01:29:59,048 --> 01:30:00,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the bowling alley?

1105
01:30:01,289 --> 01:30:03,530
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not the bowling alley, the sports shop.

1106
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:05,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Brick building, sports shop.

1107
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:07,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a plain white building.

1108
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:11,875
[SPEAKER_02]: and you could get, you know, you had guns and MREs and knives and camping gear.

1109
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:13,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Big five sporting goods or something like that?

1110
01:30:13,938 --> 01:30:17,983
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not big five, but they're out of business, but it was out there.

1111
01:30:18,164 --> 01:30:23,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to always think this was the perfect place because they had two exits.

1112
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:52,280
[SPEAKER_02]: S2100 Matt says Arco Arena, that's the only place the people not from Sacramento only ever hear me never shut up about Arco Arena I'm going to have to ask Dan because that place would have been the perfect Oh, pod culture suggests a Costco Most are concrete and plenty of supplies Except you've got multiple entrances and exits in a Costco You've got multiple loading bays You have big front glass doors for the record

1113
01:30:53,925 --> 01:30:59,969
[SPEAKER_02]: You got all the stuff you'll need to live, but one mess up, one door unguarded, and you're fucked.

1114
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:01,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, also the ceiling.

1115
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:03,291
[SPEAKER_02]: The ceiling would probably be an easy ingress as well.

1116
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:04,771
[SPEAKER_02]: This place was full cinder block.

1117
01:31:06,392 --> 01:31:07,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I knew what place you're talking about now.

1118
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I knew what place you're talking about now.

1119
01:31:09,814 --> 01:31:12,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It closed down like a while back, though.

1120
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:13,737
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1121
01:31:14,097 --> 01:31:14,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anyway.

1122
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:17,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1123
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:19,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not.

1124
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:20,172
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1125
01:31:20,352 --> 01:31:22,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured because it's kind of been a slower news week.

1126
01:31:23,139 --> 01:31:26,188
[SPEAKER_02]: SSG100 Matt says zombies can't come in without their membership card.

1127
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week but with that we're wrapping it up for the night and that is our show remember I'm going on vacation and I'm taking the show with me so I'll be out for a couple weeks sorry that's just the way the timing worked out but we will be back on March 9th with an all new episode of Orange Launch Radio I hope you all have some good time gaming I hope we have a lot of news to catch up on when we get back

1128
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, who knows?

1129
01:31:52,244 --> 01:31:56,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not ruling out that we do like a midweek catch-up thing if everybody's available after I'm back.

1130
01:31:56,888 --> 01:31:58,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I technically get back from the cruise on March.

1131
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the problem is I come back on a Sunday.

1132
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:06,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And I won't be home in time because we fly back into SFO.

1133
01:32:07,056 --> 01:32:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to take me too long to get home.

1134
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:11,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, was there a Sky tweet?

1135
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:11,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.

1136
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1137
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:12,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll look real quick.

1138
01:32:14,162 --> 01:32:14,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I missed it.

1139
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:16,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1140
01:32:16,684 --> 01:32:17,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it, DarkTitsia.

1141
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:19,046
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a moment.

1142
01:32:20,151 --> 01:32:22,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We're professionals.

1143
01:32:23,092 --> 01:32:23,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes.

1144
01:32:23,552 --> 01:32:25,953
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this podcast not for a living.

1145
01:32:26,694 --> 01:32:28,014
[SPEAKER_06]: I do remember seeing this now.

1146
01:32:28,034 --> 01:32:28,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I forgot.

1147
01:32:28,614 --> 01:32:31,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark to CS tweets us or, you know, not tweets us, whatever you want to call it.

1148
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:39,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Says, had to sky tweet y'all that we were just watching Battle Royale for our Valentine's Day night festivities.

1149
01:32:39,098 --> 01:32:40,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a good selection.

1150
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:44,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Made me reminisce about the IRL Battle Royale incident from back in the day.

1151
01:32:44,941 --> 01:32:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1152
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:45,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

1153
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:57,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper Plate Battle Royale that's right when we used to I won that by the way when we used to tape this at that old house in Citrus Heights I used to live at a long time ago do you know that pool got filled in

1154
01:32:58,393 --> 01:32:59,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a travesty.

1155
01:32:59,614 --> 01:33:00,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1156
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:00,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

1157
01:33:01,055 --> 01:33:03,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that pool was too many bad memories and too expensive.

1158
01:33:03,796 --> 01:33:05,117
[SPEAKER_06]: He ended up filling it in at some point.

1159
01:33:05,477 --> 01:33:07,839
[SPEAKER_06]: He also ended up – he got married and had kids.

1160
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:11,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was the whole like he didn't want the pool to be a danger to kids.

1161
01:33:11,661 --> 01:33:13,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I can respect that for sure.

1162
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:15,644
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was just one of those like, oh, when I heard about that.

1163
01:33:16,604 --> 01:33:16,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1164
01:33:16,885 --> 01:33:17,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1165
01:33:18,106 --> 01:33:20,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it.

1166
01:33:20,248 --> 01:33:21,630
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper plate battle royale.

1167
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:22,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1168
01:33:22,611 --> 01:33:23,272
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here.

1169
01:33:24,093 --> 01:33:26,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But not until we get some final thoughts.

1170
01:33:26,716 --> 01:33:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you're doing Debbie tonight?

1171
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:34,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I am because it's 400% survivor blood points in both modes.

1172
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1173
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:43,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have some hungry people to prestige.

1174
01:33:44,031 --> 01:33:45,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be doing that.

1175
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:47,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a Shay and a Smokey with me.

1176
01:33:47,972 --> 01:33:49,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a few others, anyone who wants to join in.

1177
01:33:51,113 --> 01:33:58,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But my big thing, everyone, every small act of resistance is still an act of resistance.

1178
01:34:01,154 --> 01:34:01,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that.

1179
01:34:03,655 --> 01:34:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one.

1180
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,000
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

1181
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,680
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in a few minutes.

1182
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:08,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1183
01:34:09,361 --> 01:34:10,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1184
01:34:10,941 --> 01:34:11,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought then.

1185
01:34:13,322 --> 01:34:18,243
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is there's this game I just saw the trailer for called Guns of Fury.

1186
01:34:18,443 --> 01:34:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if Metal Slug were a Metroidvania game.

1187
01:34:23,484 --> 01:34:24,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So highly recommend checking out.

1188
01:34:24,804 --> 01:34:25,744
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on sale right now too.

1189
01:34:26,084 --> 01:34:26,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Only $13.

1190
01:34:26,364 --> 01:34:28,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to check that out.

1191
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:29,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1192
01:34:46,053 --> 01:34:49,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my final thought then is live long and prosper.

1193
01:34:50,634 --> 01:34:53,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And God, can the Vulcans show up already and save us?

1194
01:34:53,994 --> 01:34:56,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we have first contact a little sooner than planned?

1195
01:34:56,795 --> 01:34:57,735
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fantastic.

1196
01:34:57,855 --> 01:34:58,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd really appreciate that.

1197
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:00,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, everybody.

1198
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:01,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in a few weeks.

1199
01:35:01,916 --> 01:35:02,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.
