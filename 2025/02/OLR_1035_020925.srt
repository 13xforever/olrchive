[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music

2
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:42,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

3
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:55,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live once again with our program for tonight, February the 9th of 2025.

6
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:59,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost said February 29th, but that wouldn't be accurate, now would it?

7
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:06,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try February 9th, 2025 with episode number 1035 of our program.

8
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,012
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you each and every week.

9
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:10,293
[SPEAKER_06]: with my co-hosts.

10
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,975
[SPEAKER_06]: First up, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:14,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

12
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, how are you doing?

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

14
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:27,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having quite the overwhelming day.

15
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

16
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:31,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the show can relax you a little.

17
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,270
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when you got a lot on your plate?

18
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:33,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

19
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:58,213
[SPEAKER_01]: and suddenly it's like it would be better if I didn't care about any of that yeah I I sort of like my brain is like shut off and going no stop thinking about things just just sit on the internet all day uh you know especially considering everything going on in the world at a very rapid pace I I think you are certainly not alone in a lot of those feelings and um

20
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot for anybody.

21
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:07,212
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, continuing to persist is to continue to resist.

22
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:10,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep on keeping on best y'all can.

23
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm just going to live in a cave.

24
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,417
[SPEAKER_06]: That works too.

25
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That works too.

26
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the OLR fort?

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to bring back the OLR fort.

28
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:22,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was that?

29
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:26,160
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that guy's name that lived out there in the middle of nowhere and you had to drive by that fort?

30
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of DDR Angel, well, back when she was DDR Angel, Tech Angels, one of her buddies.

31
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:36,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been so long, I can't remember the guy's name, but yeah.

32
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,176
[SPEAKER_06]: To get to his house, you had to drive by a big fort.

33
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:40,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always used to joke it would be the OLR fort.

34
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those places with giant ass walls that like somebody just had a piece of land and, you know, had their cameras up.

35
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:54,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically like, you know, this is that we don't recognize the government in these walls like that, that type of establishment.

36
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would love to have an OLR fort someday.

37
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:58,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be good.

38
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:04,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could just purchase an oil rig off the coast that no one uses and live on that like those other people did.

39
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

40
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:07,397
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

41
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a click over Alcatraz or something.

42
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,199
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

43
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's say hello to somebody who surely has a, you know, Apocalypse Day plan.

44
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:19,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Deckmaster Loki.

45
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:20,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

46
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:21,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Loki.

47
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:21,725
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

48
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

49
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:23,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have an apocalypse.

50
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:24,970
[SPEAKER_04]: When's Apocalypse Day?

51
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

52
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,253
[SPEAKER_06]: 2032, the asteroid.

53
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the new Apocalypse Day.

54
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,136
[SPEAKER_06]: The asteroid in 2032.

55
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:40,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told today was a new holiday, but only for people that are weird and have racist tendencies.

56
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:42,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Football games?

57
00:03:43,428 --> 00:03:44,488
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.

58
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Golf of America Day, a holiday that literally no one will recognize because it's stupid.

59
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:56,673
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I did not hear that that was a thing, but as I... Who do you think?

60
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:57,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Who do you think?

61
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,875
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the world does not recognize that stupidity?

62
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:27,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think I've been using metrics for the last two years?

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, video games.

65
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,362
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't take our video games yet.

66
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,303
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably try.

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:41,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, we have lots of video games to talk about and things in the news.

68
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually kind of surprised they haven't tried to come for video games yet.

69
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, give it time.

70
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:46,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them time.

71
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:47,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

72
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Indie games are always going to be a thing.

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:49,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

74
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,232
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't take away, you know, and the whole like once on the internet, always on the internet.

75
00:04:53,372 --> 00:04:57,195
[SPEAKER_06]: We have these things about Nintendo trying to take things down and then they're never really down.

76
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:01,477
[SPEAKER_06]: They're down so the lawyers can't see them, but they live on torrent sites forever.

77
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:06,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I mean, if you're Grand Theft Auto 6, you might be a little nervous right now.

78
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,083
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, indie games are never going to take that away.

79
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

80
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:18,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into, well, I guess video games were taken away for about 24 hours this weekend, right, Loki?

81
00:05:18,188 --> 00:05:18,668
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

82
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:22,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so PlayStation Network went down.

83
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,334
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a major outage that lasted 24 hours.

84
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:30,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even think it was necessarily just PlayStation Network.

85
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:34,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apparently anything connected to Sony Online Services.

86
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So multiplayer, PlayStation Store, PlayStation Network stuff.

87
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:42,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard there was even like movie stuff that was affected by that as well.

88
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, weird.

89
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

90
00:05:44,691 --> 00:06:11,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to play No Man's Sky and I couldn't upload my discoveries to the No Man's Sky database on PlayStation which that thing kind of tends to be like I feel like that thing is held together with duct tape because it doesn't you know it's up and down a lot but like I would go into the multiplayer hub and it was empty so it was it was affecting that game for sure even though I'm pretty sure they run their own servers well I mean I we don't really know why it went down but uh

91
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:21,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of interesting that around about the time that, you know, the PlayStation Network went down for 24 hours that they laid off a ton of people, so... Really?

92
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, so Sony laid off people this weekend?

93
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so, yeah.

94
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't hear about that.

95
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:29,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

96
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty close to the time that it...

97
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:37,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was... No, you're fine.

98
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:43,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, hypothetically, somebody could have pulled the plug on their way out the door.

99
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:45,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

100
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:55,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, I mean... Or they laid somebody off that had the job of keeping that up.

101
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:57,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be one or the other, yeah.

102
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:01,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about the movie Airplane with the guy holding that plug.

103
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,405
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of, you know...

104
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,902
[SPEAKER_06]: The Image I Have in My Head

105
00:07:35,181 --> 00:08:01,603
[SPEAKER_04]: that like it may have gone down for an hour or a blip here and there but this 24-hour outage was the longest it's been down since that three-week incident it was like 21 21 days 24 days it was a long time yeah so this comes from uh so allegedly uh this comes from uh Ryosuke Hana who posted on Twitter and Mastodon saying that uh most of my team was just laid off at PlayStation uh

106
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:04,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a dream to get to work there on the platform.

107
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:12,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown up since the PlayStation 1 and contributed to the PlayStation 5 portal, PSVR 2, and the PS app and future consoles.

108
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:22,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, apparently from there, we don't know how many people were laid off, but some at least, including his whole team.

109
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:26,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that sucks, to say the least.

110
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:31,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't even think of the idea that somebody could have.

111
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Allegedly, it's what we have no evidence.

112
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,683
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just one of those funky timing sort of things.

113
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:47,252
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does bring that idea that, wow, with all these people getting laid off, it's a little bit surprising that more of them don't take negative action on their way out the door.

114
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:48,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is why companies...

115
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:57,734
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, usually escort people at the building, whether they were, you know, really, really good spotless employees or otherwise.

116
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:05,357
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's just very fascinating that that timing alludes to that there could be a possibility there.

117
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:11,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, quite frankly and honestly, we don't see more of it happening with all of the layoffs in the gaming industry.

118
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fascinating.

119
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:13,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

120
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:24,694
[SPEAKER_06]: hmm I'm sure we'll hear more about that probably this week yeah I well I will we I feel like Sony I feel like Sony because what Sony's offered a consolation prize through all this right

121
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,337
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

123
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,080
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100 Matt in chat.

124
00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:00,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

125
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Except Bobby Blackwolf is not on tonight.

126
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:07,163
[SPEAKER_06]: He is enjoying Wingstop Takeout with friends at a social gathering.

127
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So, S2100 Matt says, the internet demands over this outage are insane.

128
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Demanding free games, etc.

129
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Five days of PlayStation Plus seems reasonable for a one-day outage.

130
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:17,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I...

131
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:44,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the demand of free games is maybe a little much but um you know I don't know like the games I play were not super affected so I don't know like you know if you're like a big Marvel rivals person on PlayStation and you just like could not play that game so like I could see why people are mad but they're not yeah the call for free games is a lot hmm

132
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,243
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, SJ100 Matt is right.

133
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:48,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Network outages happen.

134
00:10:49,464 --> 00:10:52,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some rainstorms here that have been moving across the country.

135
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you never know what weather can do and all that stuff.

136
00:10:55,648 --> 00:11:00,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to excuse it, but, you know, it's interesting.

137
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:04,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think Sony's going to come out and say, we're going to give you this five days.

138
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Now sit down and shut up.

139
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:12,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think they're – I mean, I'm trying to think if they might have a legal reason to disclose it to stockholders.

140
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:26,076
[SPEAKER_06]: that if stockholders may grill them about it in their next shareholder meeting, that's like probably the only way I could see that the answer to why this happened comes out is if the investors demand the reasoning.

141
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:34,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And even then, I'm not sure that really comes out in a spot for public consumption, unless of course it's leaked, which is almost certainly inevitable in this case.

142
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:34,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

143
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:39,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I mean, I think if they compensate players with five days, like

144
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:50,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We really care why it went down for I mean, they may care more like is this going to happen again very soon but like it hardly ever goes down and for 24 hours it's like

145
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:51,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

146
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a huge deal.

147
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:56,498
[SPEAKER_06]: The bigger question will be, was it a hack?

148
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it any personal data at risk?

149
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:02,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was what happened all that time ago.

150
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: The data was at risk, and that's what led to the class action, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

151
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be the big maybe in this whole picture is if –

152
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:16,098
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was actually, like, data that leaked as a result.

153
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,778
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a question they're going to have to ask.

154
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may be as much of an answer as we get.

155
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,521
[SPEAKER_06]: We have determined the cause of the downtime, and it was an unexpected situation.

156
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,902
[SPEAKER_06]: No bad actors got into the system.

157
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:28,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll be it.

158
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:29,603
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be the explanation.

159
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit happens, but your data's okay.

160
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know you shit

161
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure.

162
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:08,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually if there was a type of coordinated attack like that, some group is probably claiming responsibility in why they did it at this point.

163
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

164
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:11,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be.

165
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:24,045
[SPEAKER_06]: But usually, especially for an impressive quote-unquote amount of downtime, you would think somebody would be claiming responsibility for it and why they're going to keep doing it to Sony, what they have to change.

166
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But that part we're not really hearing.

167
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:27,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

168
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:28,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying...

169
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:33,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely off the table, but Sony's going to have to clear that up.

170
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:39,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and DarkTetsuya says apparently this took out everything from Sony, not just PSN.

171
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Loki did refer to that a little bit.

172
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:46,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is interesting that it could be like other Sony network-based services.

173
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So would that mean things like I would assume like Crunchyroll?

174
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that like a Sony service too and things?

175
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:56,182
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they were – maybe they ran on different – I'm not able to log into Crunchyroll stuff on my phone.

176
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know if they use the same login for that even though it's owned by that.

177
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, fair.

178
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:01,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

179
00:14:01,263 --> 00:14:01,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

180
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:05,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, interesting though I mean, I've been playing Fruit Mountain, so it works

181
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:08,423
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

182
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:13,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, bummer about the outage because I'm sure a lot of people want to play games this weekend.

183
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, things happen.

184
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:25,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting discussion had got brought up in our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, where, of course, you can join and talk with us throughout the week.

185
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks were talking about this.

186
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:31,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people had highlighted a social media post from GameStop.

187
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:35,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So GameStop had actually done a quote post and said –

188
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you wish you had physical games now?

189
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:51,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to that effect was the post, because GameStop's trying to needle the fact that I guess they got done in by a lot of the shift that we've had to digital games.

190
00:14:52,514 --> 00:14:55,657
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, of course, there was the dunk on the dunk, which...

191
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hmm.

192
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:26,305
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, in terms of the layoffs and doing something on your way out the door, it's best not to burn the bridge you're standing on.

193
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:28,826
[SPEAKER_06]: You pull the plug, leak info, etc.

194
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:33,729
[SPEAKER_06]: You run the risk of never getting a gig in that industry or anything related unless that's your goal.

195
00:15:34,469 --> 00:15:39,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, you bring up a good point, but I think you also get to where I'm thinking with the second half of that.

196
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I know a lot of people that love the games industry.

197
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,156
[SPEAKER_06]: They love being in it.

198
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:52,161
[SPEAKER_06]: They realize it can be a roller coaster, but at the end of the day, they just like, they love video games and they put up with all this BS to be making games.

199
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,323
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know other people in the industry that...

200
00:15:55,496 --> 00:16:02,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of want to get out of it, you know, because of all this like living on the edge and the uncertainty and you get to a point where you're like, I need some stability.

201
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some people I think that are looking for, you know –

202
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:17,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Other types of jobs that utilize those similar, you know, coding, artistic, you know, project, all the stuff that goes into making a game, all those types of skills.

203
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a student on Matt in chat says, gig income is rough.

204
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:26,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there may be some people that, especially in light of the fact that we have had so many layoffs,

205
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,382
[SPEAKER_06]: in the last year and the industry is getting so competitive.

206
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:39,588
[SPEAKER_06]: There may be, I would actually go so far as to say there's certainly a non-zero amount of employees that when they're getting laid off are going to go, you know what?

207
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:40,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck video games.

208
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:41,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.

209
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:42,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm out.

210
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I think although, yeah, what you're saying is true.

211
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,813
[SPEAKER_06]: People don't want to burn bridges.

212
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:55,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are definitely people in the gaming industry that are like, may the bridges I burn light my way out the door.

213
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:59,638
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's how it goes.

214
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:09,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's talk a little bit about our gaming week and the types of things that we have been playing this week on PlayStation or otherwise.

215
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,190
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you, of course.

216
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,851
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

217
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I played some Dragon Age.

218
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I played some DBD.

219
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:19,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Fruit Mountain.

220
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:21,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.

221
00:17:23,395 --> 00:17:25,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still recovering on my leg.

222
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been working a lot in my office.

223
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:36,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually off doing a lot of activity for another two weeks on my leg.

224
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:41,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just been trying to focus on more IRL stuff, I guess.

225
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,280
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get done well.

226
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:49,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I just was going to say, I did see a little bit of your Dragon Age stream the other night.

227
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:51,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

228
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:54,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically me yelling at the other people in the game.

229
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:54,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

230
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:00,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I mean, I'm on my third playthrough.

231
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:01,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I started my third playthrough.

232
00:18:01,073 --> 00:18:05,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I just finished my second one on Friday.

233
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:06,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

234
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm moving on to playing a Grey Warden.

235
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:10,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

236
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:21,206
[SPEAKER_06]: When you talk about talking back to the game, it makes me think about how some of the comments as people are like, is Dragon Age sort of finished?

237
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:28,927
[SPEAKER_06]: There was that random... I don't want to say random comment, but there was the comment from one of the people that worked on the game that was like, well, it belongs to fans, basically.

238
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:33,008
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dragon Age will never die because of the fans type of thing.

239
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:40,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, when you talk about making your own canon with yelling back at the characters, it just kind of makes me think of that.

240
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:40,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

241
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess my point is...

242
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I just yell back at the characters because they do stupid things.

243
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:50,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like making my own universe or anything.

244
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just yelling at people because they do stupid stuff and they frustrate me.

245
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe there needs to be a character that yells at them.

246
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:59,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's literally it.

247
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:00,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

248
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:01,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's my own

249
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:25,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I just it's like what are you doing people like why do you make the most stupid decision possible when you know it's gonna fuck up shit for me and my character like knock it off that's kind of how I feel yeah all right well we'll go to Loki how was you gonna feel that way about real life too I was gonna say it hits a little close to home uh Loki how was your good week

250
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much all Minecraft again.

251
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:34,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Just getting ready for the server stuff for this weekend.

252
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:41,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting the World Tour server up and a lot of server admin stuff, essentially.

253
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Which went well.

254
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some streamers come in yesterday and stream from the server and kind of showcase that to their fans.

255
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was nice.

256
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And then today we've been holding public...

257
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:57,023
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been open to the public, essentially.

258
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been just kind of touring around with people, helping them out with things.

259
00:20:01,126 --> 00:20:02,687
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been working on all week.

260
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:06,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And just getting ready for the launch of the next season, which is going to start this Saturday.

261
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be a lot of fun.

262
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:11,453
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be starting Season 4, Brand New World.

263
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already started my starter base.

264
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:14,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks awesome.

265
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, looking forward to kicking that off.

266
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:36,893
[SPEAKER_06]: if OLR listeners want to check out that Minecraft stuff that you made public especially because you know the water ride was obviously a huge part of that we talked about that on a prior show if OLR listeners want to get in on that and go play and check that out I would hope they've seen the video at this point but how can they actually go in there and play it for themselves

267
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:50,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much the easiest way would be to go to my YouTube channel, so LokiOLR on YouTube, and go there and check out either the community posts or really any of my videos.

268
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:57,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, recently from Channel 64, there'll be a link in there to the Channel 64 community Discord.

269
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:13,692
[SPEAKER_04]: And you go in there, just essentially join that Discord, and you'll see basically a thread about the event server and what you need to log into it, the Minecraft instance you need, and the mods and resource pack.

270
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has all that information as well as the IP.

271
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be open for like a few weeks.

272
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:18,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

273
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:19,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Go check it out.

274
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:20,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of fun.

275
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:24,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody that has seen the park and everything so far has been blown away.

276
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,321
[SPEAKER_04]: They cannot believe the stuff that they're seeing.

277
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:30,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly recommend it.

278
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:31,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

279
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,835
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of effort went into that.

280
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:40,396
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason we come here on your gaming weeks and 95% of the time you're saying it is Minecraft because you put a lot of work into it.

281
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:42,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and the other 5% is Bellaltro.

282
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

283
00:21:46,078 --> 00:21:54,880
[SPEAKER_04]: On both PC and phone, mostly phone, but yeah, it's Bellatro is a good time killer and is entertaining.

284
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:55,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

285
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try modded Bellatro.

286
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:58,241
[SPEAKER_04]: That gets really crazy.

287
00:21:58,874 --> 00:22:00,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a thing.

288
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:01,296
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I saying?

289
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm literally saying that's a thing.

290
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it's a thing.

291
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it's just I hadn't heard of what the modders... Let me rephrase.

292
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I hadn't heard of what the modders are doing to Bellatro.

293
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,247
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done some interesting things.

294
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:19,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got like, I don't even know if it's like a specific mod or what, but there's one that like introduces like almost...

295
00:22:19,892 --> 00:22:21,193
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

296
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:50,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets kind of crazy.

297
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:51,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, neat.

298
00:22:52,694 --> 00:23:01,718
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a good video, I think RT Gaming had done a video on it because he's been playing a lot of Bellatro and it just looked insane.

299
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:04,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just ridiculous.

300
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, alright.

301
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, my gaming week.

302
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:12,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, probably 95% of my gaming week this week was No Man's Sky.

303
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:20,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a stream on Monday to get in on some of the Twitch drops because I missed most of that being out when I was out of town last weekend.

304
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:31,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did a stream on Monday to try to like, you know, collect some of the Twitch stuff that was available that day and, you know, just kind of, you know, play a little No Man's Sky with the viewers and stuff.

305
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:36,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that, I kind of found like I was really drawn to go back to my save.

306
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I started on PlayStation and

307
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:53,628
[SPEAKER_06]: This is important because most of my No Man's Sky play until now has been on the Xbox system, whether that's literally on an Xbox Series X, which is where I played it most of the pandemic, or on Windows environment, which is where I usually stream it from.

308
00:23:54,849 --> 00:24:00,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But this was notable because I said, you know what, I want to play on PlayStation because I want to get a platinum trophy.

309
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's silly, but it gives me a goal.

310
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:04,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives me something to work towards.

311
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:18,717
[SPEAKER_06]: and I have just kind of fallen into it all over again because most of the play I've been doing in No Man's Sky over the last few years were when they do these limited time expeditions and I focus on the expeditions and once I'm done, I'm done.

312
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:26,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really focused on like the main storyline in a while and they've added a lot to it with all these different patches.

313
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually feel like as I'm playing the game now, I'm not experiencing as much of the world's part two

314
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,503
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

315
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:50,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm really enjoying it.

316
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:58,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the thing is, of course, and this is what No Man's Sky is infamous for, you think you're going down the main story and then it's like three branches open up here.

317
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you get a pass that opens up a whole other branch over here.

318
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:06,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is just ADHD unhinged in that game.

319
00:25:06,496 --> 00:25:09,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can do all these different things, but that's okay.

320
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Space is limitless.

321
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:15,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think once you just kind of let go of like, a game like this doesn't really end.

322
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it doesn't really matter which order you take all these, you know, different quests and things like that.

323
00:25:21,383 --> 00:25:23,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just kind of work on things a little bit at a time.

324
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,307
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm working on my Platinum.

325
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have three of the golds I need.

326
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:33,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have the golds for Aliens, Talk To, Words Learned, and...

327
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:43,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, credits, units that I've gotten, but I still have to get like walking, survival on planets, scanning all the animals on planets.

328
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:48,524
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a few more I have to get, but I think I'll be able to get the platinum in that before too long.

329
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:56,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, I've been playing a little bit of Diablo 4, of course, because there's a Lunar New Year event going on with some limited time cosmetics and things like that.

330
00:25:56,829 --> 00:26:03,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to earn a few of those rewards, but most of the week I've been distracted with No Man's Sky and I've been having a good time.

331
00:26:04,144 --> 00:26:28,633
[SPEAKER_06]: so yeah I except I think I need a new PlayStation 5 controller I've had this one for a while and now some of the vibrating feels really weird in the controller like the and the buttons aren't like doing the force feedback I think the way it's supposed to I think I might need a new PS5 controller which sucks because those things are expensive but I guess it has been like five years so it's just annoying

332
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and some of the chatters in our chat at twitch.tv slash VOG Network are talking about Community Day and Pokemon Go.

333
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I went out and did that for about an hour.

334
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:42,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do that the whole time, but I went for an hour and just caught mostly Bluetooth.

335
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:43,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm with you guys.

336
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't very giving on the Shinies today.

337
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I got three of those Carablast, the little blue bug guys, who I actually really like.

338
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:52,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Carablast.

339
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got one of the Shell thing, the Shellmet.

340
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I only got one.

341
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,920
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, all right.

342
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's just a little stingy today, that's all.

343
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:12,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But luckily, the amount of care I have on Pokemon Go these days is extremely minimal.

344
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:19,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something I do on my walks to make me feel just a little bit of a reward, a little bit of a shiny, literally in this case.

345
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:21,128
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, eh.

346
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,510
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

347
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:30,297
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some news to get into as we travel around the gaming world this week.

348
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:36,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people are distracted by games on television, but there's still a lot of video game news going on.

349
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:37,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get into it.

350
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what do you have for us?

351
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:47,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and the best thing to do between now and when we actually get the news is speculate on the news.

352
00:27:47,254 --> 00:27:48,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it up for clicks, Loki.

353
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:50,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it up for engagement.

354
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:54,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you our guesses as to what we think is going to happen.

355
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:54,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

356
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,118
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't believe guest number three.

357
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:02,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Some experts have called us insane for number four.

358
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Experts have predicted.

359
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:13,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So experts are predicting, or some experts, let's not lump in all the experts into this, okay?

360
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:14,799
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, not all experts.

361
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Experts are predicting that the Nintendo Switch 2...

362
00:28:19,722 --> 00:28:21,484
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

363
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:39,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

364
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:03,535
[SPEAKER_04]: is currently rising and the exchange rate in the environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017.

365
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't say!

366
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:13,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is from the president, Shintaro Furukawa of Nintendo.

367
00:29:14,223 --> 00:29:15,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was during their...

368
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:45,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Investor Call says also we need to consider affordable prices our customers from Nintendo products when considering price of our products we believe that's necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles so essentially you know hey we are very conscientious of the cost of our console to which I say $3.99 doesn't seem like that's out of the realm of possibility plausible

369
00:29:47,369 --> 00:30:12,197
[SPEAKER_04]: plausible yeah uh but yes apparently uh there's this analyst Reyes Elliott that says at least it's not the other one there's that other analyst every every goddamn time there's a prediction it's from him like every goddamn time it's that analyst we don't I don't hear about him anymore I welcome our new our I well what's this guy's name again

370
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So IGN has interviewed several industry analysts.

371
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:23,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently there's a sweet spot.

372
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:24,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, who is it?

373
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:25,218
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the person's name?

374
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise Elliot.

375
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Rise Elliot.

376
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the gaming analyst community.

377
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:31,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck and don't fuck it up.

378
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:36,184
[SPEAKER_04]: and Ampere Analysis, Pierce Harding roles.

379
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:42,448
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically said that early adopters will be price sensitive and price can always be lowered.

380
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:47,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is announced at.

381
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:48,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

382
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So glad that you're industry experts.

383
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:56,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, that's not exactly a bold prediction because I'm sitting there going, yeah.

384
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:56,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

385
00:30:57,705 --> 00:30:59,786
[SPEAKER_04]: These people get paid money for their predictions.

386
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:34,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the TLDR is... Most of the modern consoles nowadays are coming out at $499, and Nintendo's hardware probably won't be as powerful as those, so it'll probably be $399, because that makes sense.

387
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:43,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's not going to be $299, because that's too inexpensive for what they're going to put in the box, so it makes sense that it's $399, because that is...

388
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:49,714
[SPEAKER_04]: about, you know, a generation or so behind, and that's kind of where they're at price point-wise.

389
00:31:50,194 --> 00:31:55,696
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this, though, said, like... Like, you don't need to hire an analyst for this kind of stuff.

390
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:56,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, honestly.

391
00:31:57,136 --> 00:32:01,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... Yes, the price point will be somewhere.

392
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:05,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It will probably be affordable and not too expensive as to drive off customers.

393
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:06,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

394
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

395
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it would be, because that's how we price things.

396
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:11,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

397
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:25,076
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya in chat says more armchair analysts go figure well that's because most of the people investing money in video games don't play video games this is an analyst that gets paid by industry like that

398
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:32,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Dr. Sia says, I do like Rob's prediction on 479 and comes with Mario Kart.

399
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:33,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be okay with that one.

400
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:33,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

401
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:43,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Do remember, though, that was only my prediction for how might the tariffs fuck this all up if that actually becomes a thing, which for China it is.

402
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:45,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know anymore.

403
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:47,408
[SPEAKER_06]: This guy makes so fucking many threats and stuff.

404
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:52,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even remember which ones are which, but I do believe the China ones did go into effect earlier.

405
00:32:52,991 --> 00:33:02,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so, yeah, I mean, we, we, it'll depend again on how many of those parts did Nintendo already get before assembling them.

406
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:08,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they buy them into, I, I, I'm going to be honest, I really don't know how this works.

407
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:17,318
[SPEAKER_06]: If they get them from China, but then build them in another country and then bring them in from that country to here that isn't subject to tariffs, does it get tariffed?

408
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't really know.

409
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, yeah.

410
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:22,462
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

411
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:39,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am putting that footnote that I don't think they will bundle it with a game unless they need to to keep the costs down because of these short-sighted tariff things and oops, I fucked the economy, that whole thing.

412
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else on Switch 2?

413
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:52,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have, of course, more things other than just speculating on what the cost is going to be.

414
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:58,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Nintendo is doing what they can to stop scalpers.

415
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:05,923
[SPEAKER_04]: We kind of heard this before, that they're going to be doing something, but we haven't really heard what exactly that would be.

416
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:12,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will take all possible measures on the experience we have accumulated to date.

417
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:41,640
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding scalpers and the like well I mean the only thing they have to do is make enough consoles period and that's not gonna scalpers won't be an issue the other option too along with that is you know maybe doing some pre-orders through Nintendo online which they've done for like things that you wouldn't think would necessarily be part of that like Alarmo so maybe they do something like that I don't know but that's kind of all

418
00:34:42,796 --> 00:34:44,077
[SPEAKER_04]: They've really said so far.

419
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:46,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do.

420
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to give them the benefit of the doubt.

421
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:53,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand why they don't want to say more, because they don't want the scalpers to know what they're going to do.

422
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: If you say it's going to work like this, then that gives the scalpers X many months to figure out how to fuck with the system.

423
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,452
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would assume...

424
00:35:03,513 --> 00:35:04,233
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

425
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:29,645
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think you'll see the level of like people at Costco fighting over pallets full of Pokemon cards that they want to go flip on eBay type of thing.

426
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:40,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's going to be that lawless when it comes to at least – I think that's what Nintendo is aiming for because we've seen that how many times like with the NES Classic and that shit when that was all released.

427
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:41,714
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a thing.

428
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:45,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see why they –

429
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:47,678
[SPEAKER_06]: might want to do the pre-order again.

430
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:51,542
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Sony did for PlayStation 5 for a while, right?

431
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:56,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they were trying to combat scalping with limited success.

432
00:35:56,247 --> 00:35:56,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I think...

433
00:35:57,927 --> 00:36:26,621
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 5s were just impossible to get a hold of scalping or not they just weren't making enough of them but that that goes into you know COVID related issues and all that true that's yeah I'm not like yeah do I fault PlayStation for the shortage a little bit but I also understand there was a world event that happened that's really Sony could not have planned for and you know it's also during the time when they had all those chip shortages and all that stuff too yeah so there was a lot of that yeah um

434
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:44,884
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing too, kind of feeding into some of the speculation that's already occurred regarding the initial launch trailer of the Switch 2 which made it seem like the new Joy-Cons would be able to be used in some sort of fashion like a mouse on their side and rolling on a surface

435
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:52,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently there is now a patent that Nintendo has registered that does kind of allude to that functionality.

436
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:59,600
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is possible that that is going to be how they're going to be used, or at least one way they could be used.

437
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It says this input device comprises of the front surface, the upper surface, and the first side surface.

438
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:23,486
[SPEAKER_04]: and it says along that the sensor for the mouse operation detects the reflected light from the detected surface and the light changing by moving the detected so it's an optical mouse essentially it operates like an optical mouse on the side of the controller and you can move it around though I say that like

439
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,926
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of surface are we talking about moving around on?

440
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:34,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're playing it, maybe on a table or something, but I know if I'm playing on the couch, that's not going to be comfortable.

441
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, unless you have a book or something.

442
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:38,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll have to see.

443
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It's neat that the option's there, I guess.

444
00:37:41,658 --> 00:37:44,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you going to say something, Jamie?

445
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

446
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:52,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking, I'm not the first to say this, but I definitely don't want to be the last.

447
00:37:53,452 --> 00:38:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going to have mouse functionality on the new Nintendo Switch, then are we getting a new Mario Paint, finally?

448
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:06,537
[SPEAKER_06]: At least we better fucking get Mario Paint on Nintendo Switch Online.

449
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was like one other mouse game.

450
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:10,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was one, was it...

451
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:13,620
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe, did Lemmings use the mouse as well?

452
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:14,801
[SPEAKER_06]: It might have.

453
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:19,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a King Arthur related game that used the mouse as well.

454
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:24,648
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some other game that I think was like a Lemmings was popular so we made this as well type of thing.

455
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:25,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

456
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not just make Mario Music Maker?

457
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:47,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

458
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

459
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

460
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:53,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Deft in chat says Mario Maker 3, but now you can create your own assets.

461
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:54,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

462
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:55,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.

463
00:38:55,846 --> 00:39:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That would open the door to like a Super Mario Maker 3 where this time you can paint the bricks and the assets in the game and then make your own level music.

464
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:06,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be incredible.

465
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Except, you know, the time to penis on a game like that?

466
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:10,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

467
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:11,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

468
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:20,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, and what I mean by that of course is how long before somebody makes a level, the big bag of dicks level, where everything is a dick.

469
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario's a dick, the bricks are dicks, everything's a dick.

470
00:39:23,753 --> 00:39:26,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That would come out in less than a minute.

471
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:27,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Less than a minute.

472
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:28,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Always have to be dicks.

473
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't it be like a twat or something?

474
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:38,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be, but you and I both know that these silly people, they're going to draw big dicks first.

475
00:39:38,311 --> 00:39:39,332
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they always do.

476
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:40,773
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can't, of course.

477
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:42,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the levels with the hairy clams?

478
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,376
[SPEAKER_01]: After the dicks comes the twats and the boobs and the butts.

479
00:39:47,536 --> 00:39:47,917
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

480
00:39:48,037 --> 00:39:49,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Twats first.

481
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:51,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what do you think about that?

482
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say.

483
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:55,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

484
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:02,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

485
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Rob.

486
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:04,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

487
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:08,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange, right in chat.

488
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:09,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sorry.

489
00:40:10,046 --> 00:40:10,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

490
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time I've stopped reading a comment to read somebody else's comment.

491
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:14,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go back, though.

492
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,435
[SPEAKER_06]: PogCulture in chat says, Mario Peen.

493
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:19,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

494
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

495
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:22,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Peent.

496
00:40:24,818 --> 00:40:25,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange, right?

497
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:28,243
[SPEAKER_06]: The comment I was going to read says Magic Pen Gel Reboot?

498
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:33,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine Nintendo just fucking swiping the Magic Pen Gel concept and making their own game.

499
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:34,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

500
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:37,055
[SPEAKER_01]: My platform is here.

501
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:40,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Dicks are not default.

502
00:40:43,636 --> 00:41:01,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, SSJ100Matt with some facts, courtesy of Wikipedia Games that ran on the Super Nintendo Mouse Holy fuck, there were like 30 games that ran on this Oh, a bunch of them were Japan only We disturb our explicitness with facts Oh my god, how dare you?

503
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:02,709
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you?

504
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:10,013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a video game podcast Where did you think facts were going to be allowed, SSJ100Matt?

505
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:10,674
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you?

506
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:11,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Facts

507
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:16,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You show me any video game podcast where facts matter.

508
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:20,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me a YouTube channel where the facts are relevant.

509
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wow, I did not know.

510
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:30,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a port of Civilization on the Super Nintendo.

511
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:32,705
[SPEAKER_06]: That I knew, but it used the mouse.

512
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:35,367
[SPEAKER_06]: That I didn't know because I played it on an actual PC.

513
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:38,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Revolution X. With ActRaiser?

514
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:40,364
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not with Actraiser.

515
00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Revolution X, use the mouse.

516
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:46,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And Terminator 2.

517
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:47,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

518
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Arcade game.

519
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:50,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be damned.

520
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:52,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

521
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:53,689
[SPEAKER_06]: SimAnt.

522
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I forget most of these games were even on the Super Nintendo because I always think of them as PC games.

523
00:41:59,111 --> 00:41:59,791
[SPEAKER_06]: SimAnt.

524
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Vegas Stakes, use the mouse?

525
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:04,173
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

526
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, alright.

527
00:42:07,114 --> 00:42:07,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, shit.

528
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:13,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, damn, shut me up here.

529
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:16,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there were like three games that used the mouse.

530
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:20,044
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of those were Japan and PAL region games.

531
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:23,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you take those out, it's down to like maybe 20.

532
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:26,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So 3, 20, what's the difference?

533
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What's even crazier now is the homebrew scene, especially even on the Nintendo side.

534
00:42:30,987 --> 00:42:38,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen creators have an adapter for the Nintendo mouse to make it work on the NES with games.

535
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one that's like a

536
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:51,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a... I don't... It's sort of like a Myst-type game or something like that.

537
00:42:52,171 --> 00:42:59,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you would necessarily... Not a hidden image, but it's like a puzzle game where you navigate around the screen using the mouse and stuff.

538
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:00,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to different rooms.

539
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:16,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I'm sitting here thinking about it, though, I will say what this list has made me think of is I'm looking there at all these PC games that I kind of forgot existed on Super Nintendo that supported the mouse, like The Civilization, The Sim Ant, and those sorts of things.

540
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does make me think of, hear me out here, the great debate about controller versus keyboard and mouse.

541
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:33,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So hypothetically, hypothetically, let's say that Microsoft is going to release Halo Master Chief Collection on the Switch 2.

542
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:41,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you not, with this thing, have something that's kind of like a controller and keyboard mouse hybrid?

543
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:43,719
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what they show.

544
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning your left hand is... Okay, so that is what they're going for.

545
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

546
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:50,006
[SPEAKER_04]: They have it in the picture.

547
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,148
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what they're showing.

548
00:43:52,328 --> 00:44:00,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one hand would be holding the throwback to the Nunchuck, or in this case, the left Joy-Con, and then the other one would be...

549
00:44:01,938 --> 00:44:26,877
[SPEAKER_06]: so then it just clicked for me it's these it's these shooter games we usually think of as you know keyboard mouse and like your overwatches would be a huge one or marvel rivals whatever the fuck you're playing you know though it's those types of games too where it's like oh i don't play those on uh switch because i don't like to play games with controller well now you have a choice and that's something that playstation and xbox even don't have

550
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:29,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be very interesting.

551
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:37,630
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100Matt says, Oh yeah, that's a safe bet, S2100Matt.

552
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:44,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say a lot of these games that are still ongoing are hugely safe bets for the Switch 2.

553
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:51,124
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we all know, these games that are already a year old can't carry the Switch 2 forever.

554
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, things like Diablo 4, No Man's Sky is out on everything, right?

555
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,091
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be out on Switch 2.

556
00:44:59,692 --> 00:45:06,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, Genshin Impact, all those types of games...

557
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:34,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Fortnite, Roblox they'll all be out on Switch dead by daylight even though that's not really a well I guess it could be a I guess that could be a very interesting game with this sort of setup the keyboard mouse controller hybrid so yeah I think all of those games absolutely happen on the Switch too absolutely it's just a matter of how fast so yeah

558
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:35,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

559
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Mike Def says, remember when Genshin Impact got announced for the Switch and never came out?

560
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did not realize it never came out.

561
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:44,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I just assumed it was on the Switch.

562
00:45:46,803 --> 00:45:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe it has something to do with the power of the Switch.

563
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:52,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it will be less of an issue on Switch 2.

564
00:45:52,867 --> 00:46:04,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume there will be a few games like that that never quite made it to Switch, but hit that PlayStation 4, Xbox One level that we will see on Switch 2 because just having the additional oomph behind it.

565
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:05,876
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

566
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:12,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Civilization 7 is a big game that's scheduled to come out this week, but a lot of people are already getting their hands on it.

567
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:29,370
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

568
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,545
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

569
00:47:10,157 --> 00:47:11,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand, it's confusing.

570
00:47:12,518 --> 00:47:16,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, but some of the fan reaction, not great.

571
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:26,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and this is the other problem with early access, is that when these reviews come in from fans, with all the problems, it can affect the release.

572
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:28,764
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, let's look at it this way.

573
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:33,046
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're greedy enough to offer these early access things for cost...

574
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should make sure that your game is up to snuff when it comes out.

575
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:41,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only hurting yourself because of your bad decisions.

576
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:45,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It's even giving me pause, and I love Civ, but I'm sitting here going, hmm.

577
00:47:45,432 --> 00:47:50,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a situation where we're only listening to the negative and not looking for any positive?

578
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,795
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

579
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:16,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Navigation, how a lot of information is conveyed in the game.

580
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the numerical counters look really basic as fuck and all this, like it looks just kind of like half-baked and stuff.

581
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:26,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe it's just, it seems very messy.

582
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, Reddit has now compiled a bunch of things that people are bitching about, meaning city icons blocking unit icons, menus full of empty space.

583
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:42,825
[SPEAKER_06]: that's because they know there's DLC later they're gonna fill in that space with which is a whole other issue um

584
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:46,894
[SPEAKER_06]: People just saying the UI in Civ 6 is better.

585
00:48:48,195 --> 00:49:03,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, but to DarkSakura's point, when you go to Metacritic and some of the more people that get paid to do reviews or whatever you want to call it, I believe the score last I looked on Metacritic was 81, which is not a particularly bad score.

586
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:07,288
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an oh my god kind of score, but it's definitely not a bad score.

587
00:49:07,308 --> 00:49:08,088
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a green light.

588
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:08,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't

589
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,031
[SPEAKER_06]: 8 out of 10 games

590
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:55,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Civilization comes with DLC later down the turnpike and I will admit it's giving me pause for do I need to get this game right now or should I just wait for the inevitable in three years there'll be the game of the year edition that has all the DLC built into it

591
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the time to mod?

592
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:58,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Mod is going to mod.

593
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:30,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do remember this game exists on PlayStation and Xbox as well, and almost certainly Switch too, where it's going to be a lot harder for the modding to happen.

594
00:50:31,144 --> 00:50:36,306
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, if you're a PC gamer for Civ, of course, modders are going to fix this.

595
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:40,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just this game hasn't even released yet, and I'm sure the modders are on it.

596
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:41,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it a little time.

597
00:50:42,108 --> 00:50:42,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

598
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:43,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

599
00:50:43,818 --> 00:50:45,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's going to happen, though.

600
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it is.

601
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course it is.

602
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt in chat says, the Civ community memes have been funny.

603
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:54,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me wants to see what they do after the first big update.

604
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:56,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Then maybe I'll wait until the summer.

605
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:01,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Bonds006 in chat says, oh, looking at Steam Deck.

606
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:03,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were talking about Civ.

607
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, talking about other topics.

608
00:51:05,591 --> 00:51:10,174
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have heard some people have said Civ 7 seems to run pretty good on the Steam Deck.

609
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:15,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I mean, it's supposed to be also working on current consoles, which, you know, the Steam Deck.

610
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:20,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too surprised to hear that, that it works pretty well on the Steam Deck and probably makes a good case for that.

611
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:27,759
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, if the UI has itty-bitty numbers trying to convey some information, that probably doesn't read very well on a Steam Deck.

612
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

613
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where I stand on Civ.

614
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of went from like, oh, day one purchase, I have to buy it because it's Civ, to like, eh.

615
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see what more of my friends have to say on this.

616
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:42,558
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

617
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:50,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could also see if any early access people that you know would just let you play.

618
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:51,650
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point, too.

619
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:55,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could try it before you buy.

620
00:51:55,822 --> 00:52:01,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I make a lot of decisions with Twitch, too, just watching people that I know play games where it's not filtered.

621
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:02,751
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the real game.

622
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:14,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Admittedly, I haven't had a lot of time this weekend to watch Civ streams, but I will probably do that, if not this evening, a little bit tomorrow, and just kind of see where people are at with it and what...

623
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:17,187
[SPEAKER_06]: What they're thinking about it.

624
00:52:18,088 --> 00:52:28,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hate to see a Civ game flop, but at the same time, if the business of video games is ruining the video game, then maybe it needs to.

625
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:37,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I hear about empty space in menus that seems almost certain for DLC and things that are rushed and all this stuff, then I don't know.

626
00:52:38,123 --> 00:52:42,406
[SPEAKER_06]: The good news is Civilization 1, which is still my favorite.

627
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:43,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if it's old.

628
00:52:43,567 --> 00:52:44,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Civ 1 is still my favorite.

629
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:47,664
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't take that away.

630
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:50,065
[SPEAKER_06]: That game's never going to go away.

631
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

632
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.

633
00:52:55,807 --> 00:53:04,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I don't care to support something, though, that is knowingly released incomplete.

634
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:05,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, oh, for sure.

635
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:06,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

636
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

637
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're forced into it time after time.

638
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:14,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people are like, why are video games underperforming?

639
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:16,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Siv-Rev Siv-Rev

640
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:46,956
[SPEAKER_06]: SivSav is getting a VR port pretty soon.

641
00:53:47,357 --> 00:54:05,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It is going to be exclusive to the Meta headsets, but Meta 2K and Firaxis Games did announce that this game will be available on the MetaQuest 3 and 3S this spring, and you will be able to freely switch between virtual and mixed reality as you want to.

642
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:06,415
[SPEAKER_06]: In a quote,

643
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:13,699
[SPEAKER_06]: In virtual reality, players are transported to an ornate museum as they look out onto a vista personalized to their leader.

644
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,282
[SPEAKER_06]: In mixed reality, the command table adapts to its placement in a player's physical space.

645
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Detailed dioramas can be viewed in the archives, a room in your museum dedicated to your gameplay achievements displayed in both virtual and mixed reality.

646
00:54:29,292 --> 00:54:36,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see what any of that has to do with the game, but it's the ooh pretty, which I guess works for VR a lot of the time.

647
00:54:37,242 --> 00:54:37,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

648
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:43,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Civ 7, of course, comes out for everybody on February 11th.

649
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:56,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not know the exact release date or price of the meta version of the game, but you can wish list it on the store if you want right now, because of course they're going to take your money the day after the press release comes out.

650
00:54:56,741 --> 00:55:00,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I am curious about, and I see folks in chat saying, I do want to try it.

651
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see it in action.

652
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:08,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious, like I am no fan of meta right now, but from the concept of,

653
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:27,531
[SPEAKER_06]: justify VR and gaming outside of Beat Saber from that perspective I'm curious what they come up with but I don't see myself running out and buying a meta quest I can confidently say I do not see that in my future I am never giving meta any money

654
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:29,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why I would either.

655
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:39,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that Valve doesn't walk away from the five, that maybe there's another one of those in the future, but again, there's just not a lot.

656
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll see a Vision Pro release.

657
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,452
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot happening in the gaming space.

658
00:55:45,312 --> 00:55:46,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot more...

659
00:55:47,433 --> 00:56:00,488
[SPEAKER_04]: headset developers or hardware manufacturers other than Meta and Valve when it comes to that stuff so I wouldn't worry that there's not going to be any headsets out there there's like there's a lot from a lot of companies we don't even hear about all the time but

660
00:56:02,248 --> 00:56:26,065
[SPEAKER_06]: once again modders to the rescue anything exclusive to meta they'll open it up to everything else if there's one thing the modding, hacking, cracking and all those communities they do not like it's that exclusive shit so they'll crack it to run on other platforms it may not run well because the Vive is a few years old at this point but you know these other headset companies that Loki's talking about perhaps

661
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

662
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:35,211
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura with an interesting reminder on something I think a lot of people forgot about, quite frankly.

663
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:39,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the SAG AfterStrike is, you know, still ongoing.

664
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:42,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget about our voice actors.

665
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:51,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Destiny 2 Heresy, of course, has already launched and instead of...

666
00:56:53,076 --> 00:57:11,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Having, you know, like scab voices, I guess, or anything like that, they've just left those voice sections blank for certain lines and are making up for it with subtitles that are enabled by default so that when you come to a scene, you're not missing on the narrative.

667
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:12,838
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not voiced.

668
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:39,030
[SPEAKER_01]: so um and you can uh as they're saying you can alter size color background uh show speaker's name and do a lot more um to make it easier to understand um you know mostly for uh visual accessibility and they have a bunch of other accessibility uh features in there but this was the big one in in uh

669
00:57:40,150 --> 00:58:01,589
[SPEAKER_01]: uh regards to the strike um the exception being those who signed uh agreements with SAG-AFTRA um that enabled them to continue work yeah which uh Bungie I believe what beat with their partnership with Sony and everything um would not not have an exception so um

670
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,492
[SPEAKER_01]: and Activision though did confirm it recast characters for Black Ops 6 after the strike.

671
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:12,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

672
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:18,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, which is, just for the record, is bad.

673
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:24,447
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do appreciate that Bungie, I feel like, made the right call here.

674
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:27,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, obviously, the right call would be to give the voice actors what they want.

675
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:33,394
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of companies, and AI protection specifically, you know, being part of that.

676
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:42,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize this is multiple companies have to come to the table with this, but I will say I appreciate that Bungie did not go the step of using

677
00:58:43,502 --> 00:58:52,787
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Fiverr hired voice actors to fill in the gap that they did make it a point to be intentionally unvoiced.

678
00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:58,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is the right move from the developer's standpoint and the most they can do during this strike.

679
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

680
00:59:17,082 --> 00:59:38,812
[SPEAKER_06]: and I still don't hear an end in sight and it's AI protections is what they're so I again I appreciate that the devs didn't use shitty AI they didn't use you know these these other you know Fiverr hired voice actors and things like that they left it blank which is I think the right thing to do to keep the game moving I guess when the strike is bigger than this one particular studio um

681
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:53,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to just say right now that I am not going to ever permit my voice being used without my knowledge for any sort of AI training tool.

682
00:59:54,346 --> 00:59:56,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say this right here, right now.

683
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:57,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not consent.

684
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:10,531
[SPEAKER_01]: and even if it was that I had been licensed to do something in the past or my voice being on the podcast was just out there

685
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:13,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't consent to that.

686
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:16,779
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not any term of anything that I'm doing.

687
01:00:16,979 --> 01:00:29,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't signed any agreements that permit this or given anyone the ability to recreate my voice and the fact that these companies feel entitled to do so is absolutely disgusting.

688
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:56,212
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% and we are this particular show is self hosted and owned thanks to a extremely generous person who makes it all happen it is not a part of any like libsyn or not that I'm saying these companies practice that but I'm just saying there is no other company that hosts this show that could sign an agreement like that that we would be subject to so we are completely independent in that nature so the only people that can give that permission is us

689
01:00:56,812 --> 01:00:58,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody can speak on behalf of us.

690
01:00:59,153 --> 01:01:02,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess Jason could technically give that permission, but he's not going to.

691
01:01:02,594 --> 01:01:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where that stands.

692
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:09,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and of course we stand with voice actors.

693
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:11,778
[SPEAKER_01]: They deserve the AI protections.

694
01:01:12,858 --> 01:01:16,940
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can do it actually anyway because we still haven't signed any kind of agreement.

695
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one can.

696
01:01:21,325 --> 01:01:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course we stand with the voice actors and the AI thing.

697
01:01:24,727 --> 01:01:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such an easy thing that ought to be resolved.

698
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't use AI on people's voices without their consent, period.

699
01:01:32,593 --> 01:01:33,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Or their art.

700
01:01:33,613 --> 01:01:34,054
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

701
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, in the case of a voice actor, the voice is art.

702
01:01:38,957 --> 01:01:39,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, 100%.

703
01:01:40,678 --> 01:01:41,819
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying in general.

704
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:42,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

705
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:43,860
[SPEAKER_01]: It's across the board.

706
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:55,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use any generative AI without the consent of those who are training it or hire a batch to train your AI and pay those people for their skills.

707
01:01:55,799 --> 01:02:01,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will admit, I do see some humor, a limited amount of humor, in that, what was that?

708
01:02:01,944 --> 01:02:05,207
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a Chinese AI thing that caught wildfire recently.

709
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a huge app on the store and all this stuff.

710
01:02:07,649 --> 01:02:08,330
[SPEAKER_06]: DeepSeek.

711
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Backset, thank you, DeepSeek.

712
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:16,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people at OpenAI complained that DeepSeek stole the learning methodology from OpenAI.

713
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:21,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of those things where it's like, do you know who I do not feel bad for in this moment?

714
01:02:21,762 --> 01:02:21,802
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

715
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:23,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of them.

716
01:02:23,879 --> 01:02:25,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know who I do not feel bad for right now?

717
01:02:31,492 --> 01:02:32,513
[SPEAKER_06]: None of it should be stolen.

718
01:02:33,493 --> 01:02:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But if an individual like James Earl Jones and his estate wants to allow that, that is different.

719
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:42,456
[SPEAKER_06]: He is consented.

720
01:02:42,956 --> 01:02:43,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

721
01:02:43,836 --> 01:02:44,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

722
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:51,479
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you also look at, say, Troy Baker doing Indiana Jones now, which Harrison Ford is still alive.

723
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:52,279
[SPEAKER_06]: He could have done it.

724
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:56,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, it would have cost – so to save on cost.

725
01:02:56,241 --> 01:02:56,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

726
01:02:57,409 --> 01:03:25,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so either and so you know Troy Baker did but Harrison Ford has said basically that Troy Baker did a fine job he made some interesting comments where it was kind of like I think he was trying to say if they wanted to take my soul they've already done it like they said like type of thing but I don't think that was a dig on Troy Baker I think that was a dig on the series is gonna go on with or without him one way or another and I kind of took it to be like at least they did this and not AI like they were gonna do it one way or another.

727
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one in this universe as grumpy as Harrison Ford, okay?

728
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Get off my damn plane.

729
01:03:33,673 --> 01:03:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it he said in Air Force One?

730
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:35,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

731
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

732
01:03:36,034 --> 01:03:36,314
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

733
01:03:38,335 --> 01:03:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: He is a grumpopotamus, but we love him.

734
01:03:40,836 --> 01:03:41,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

735
01:03:42,637 --> 01:03:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

736
01:03:43,177 --> 01:03:43,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

737
01:03:45,464 --> 01:03:52,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so we've got some news about no delays, and we love no delays.

738
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:57,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So originally, Grand Theft Auto 6 was supposed to be, well, I mean, it's been moved a few times.

739
01:03:57,872 --> 01:03:59,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're in 2025, and the initial, you know,

740
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:08,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Estimate when is the fall of 2025.

741
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:18,037
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we have a brand new investor call that has now confirmed that, yes, they are still targeting 2025 for now.

742
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:22,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, look, there's always a risk of slippage.

743
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as soon as you say a word like absolutely, you jinx things.

744
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:28,982
[SPEAKER_04]: So we feel really good about it.

745
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:35,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the game is equally anticipated both internally and externally.

746
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:37,546
[SPEAKER_04]: We know Rockstar seeks perfection.

747
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I would never claim success before it occurs.

748
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:45,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of the continued success.

749
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we are running scared and looking all over our shoulders, we know that our competition is on sleep.

750
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:54,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Our whole organization is super excited.

751
01:04:54,952 --> 01:05:23,271
[SPEAKER_06]: but yes so right now it's that they are not delaying it but that's not to say that there could not be any more delays so we'll just have to wait and see we will have to delay the announcement of a delay because at this time we do not forecast a delay but I'm not saying there won't be a delay our delay is delayed exactly our delay is just not today and our response to the delay being delayed is delayed so

752
01:05:24,602 --> 01:05:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to wait a little bit on that delay.

753
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:29,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

754
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Better delayed than cancelled.

755
01:05:35,187 --> 01:05:39,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Better delayed than cancelled, which is what happened to the Nintendo PlayStation.

756
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:49,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, as I'm sure many of you recall, that originally the PlayStation was going to be Sony's first add-on for the Super Nintendo.

757
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:53,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ken Kutaragi, for coming up with the concept.

758
01:05:55,282 --> 01:06:09,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Shuhei Yoshida, of course, who worked for Sony for a very, very long time, but recently retired, has been opening up a little bit in some interviews about his experience with this failed Nintendo partnership in the Nintendo PlayStation.

759
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:19,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So he went on some YouTube channel or something that he, the MinMax, I think was the name of the channel, and

760
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:21,771
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

761
01:06:49,056 --> 01:06:50,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a shooter.

762
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:56,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember on the Sega CD system, there's an amazing game from Game Arts, a space shooter.

763
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,144
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about Silphid.

764
01:06:59,325 --> 01:07:03,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the assets are streamed from the CD, so lots of assets coming in.

765
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:06,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember who made it.

766
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:08,553
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have been developed in the US or Japan.

767
01:07:08,593 --> 01:07:11,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was actually in Sony's archive.

768
01:07:11,856 --> 01:07:18,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's kind of giving you some insight as to what that CD was doing for the Super Nintendo at the time.

769
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,625
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we all know, it didn't end up happening and PlayStation became its own thing.

770
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are all these years later on the PS5.

771
01:07:25,287 --> 01:07:28,448
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much more drama in that.

772
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Cliff notes.

773
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:34,289
[SPEAKER_01]: The arrangement, though, between Sony and Nintendo would have fucked over Nintendo.

774
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:36,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad.

775
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:40,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Nintendo's like, we're just going to go talk to Philips then.

776
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:44,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sony's like, fuck you talking to Philips.

777
01:07:44,392 --> 01:07:46,073
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do our own thing then.

778
01:07:46,673 --> 01:07:49,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nintendo's like, well, fuck CDs all together.

779
01:07:52,045 --> 01:07:53,306
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do a cartridge!

780
01:07:54,327 --> 01:07:57,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's looking at them like, the fuck you doing?

781
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the drama.

782
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:04,796
[SPEAKER_06]: You should really have a YouTube channel where this is how you explain video game drama.

783
01:08:07,378 --> 01:08:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And I even got a name for you.

784
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:11,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be called... Breaking it down for a bitch.

785
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:17,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna call it The Gaming Tea.

786
01:08:17,688 --> 01:08:33,076
[SPEAKER_01]: or you could, yeah, you could throw like some gaming lingo in there, breaking it down for a bite I don't know, anyway, alright, fine I know, just be like it's just gonna be called, fuck you the story of fuckery in the gaming industry it's all fuckery, I don't know

787
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,361
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also a lot of stubbornness thrown in there too And I don't know if it's just me

788
01:09:03,035 --> 01:09:03,335
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

789
01:09:32,114 --> 01:09:42,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, you know, there's the series of games called The Resistance and a lot of people were pretty fond of it.

790
01:09:43,524 --> 01:09:45,506
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, I'm going to jump in.

791
01:09:45,546 --> 01:09:49,169
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I think you actually have something on the Grammys.

792
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:50,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked the wrong one?

793
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:51,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

794
01:09:51,732 --> 01:09:52,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I?

795
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:52,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

796
01:09:52,973 --> 01:09:53,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, I do.

797
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:54,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

798
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:54,895
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

799
01:09:55,815 --> 01:09:56,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

800
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Live things happen.

801
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do things not work?

802
01:10:01,142 --> 01:10:01,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

803
01:10:01,582 --> 01:10:02,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I don't know where it is.

804
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:03,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Because life is hard.

805
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:04,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh, fuck.

806
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:06,904
[SPEAKER_01]: No, everything is hard.

807
01:10:06,945 --> 01:10:09,466
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like, do you want cookies?

808
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:13,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the cookies I can put in my mouth and eat when I'm depressed.

809
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:15,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is all the time.

810
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:19,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about... No, just let me read the fucking thing.

811
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:21,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hi.

812
01:10:22,072 --> 01:10:23,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so.

813
01:10:23,973 --> 01:10:24,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Wizardry.

814
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:25,474
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?

815
01:10:25,674 --> 01:10:26,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that better?

816
01:10:26,234 --> 01:10:26,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, much.

817
01:10:28,727 --> 01:10:55,779
[SPEAKER_01]: so the composer for Wizardry Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord won a Grammy yay won in the best score soundtrack for video games and other interactive media category which was introduced about two years ago the other nominees were Pinar Toprak for Avatar Frontiers of Pandora which has a fucking amazing soundtrack for the record

818
01:10:56,691 --> 01:11:11,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear McCreary for God of War Ragnarok Valhalla, John Pisano for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Wilbur Droger 2 for Star Wars Outlaws but Phillip says that she was blown away by the win

819
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:14,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

820
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:16,871
[SPEAKER_01]: She also just looks so pleased.

821
01:11:17,933 --> 01:11:18,934
[SPEAKER_06]: She does look very pleased.

822
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:26,224
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not just like the, oh yeah, I'm a professional and I won the Grammy.

823
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:28,106
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, holy shit, I won the Grammy!

824
01:11:28,307 --> 01:11:29,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to be fair, I wouldn't

825
01:11:29,528 --> 01:11:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I would consider that Wizardry Proving Grounds was really an underdog.

826
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:34,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not talking of the scores.

827
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:36,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just talking of the games.

828
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: When you put all these games side by side, Wizardry Proving Grounds really kind of looks like an underdog because it's a remaster of a really old game.

829
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,220
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of Digital Eclipse's

830
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very green and has a cloak That's not perfect for wizardry

831
01:12:12,213 --> 01:12:13,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Assassin's Creed 3 and God of War

832
01:12:40,192 --> 01:12:42,676
[SPEAKER_01]: and she wrote a book called A Composer's Guide to Game Music.

833
01:12:43,217 --> 01:12:43,718
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

834
01:12:44,339 --> 01:12:47,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very inspirational for people maybe getting into gaming music.

835
01:12:48,045 --> 01:12:48,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Neat.

836
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Loki, what do you have for us?

837
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:56,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about what could have been is being muted.

838
01:12:57,296 --> 01:13:01,759
[SPEAKER_04]: What could have been with Resistance 4.

839
01:13:01,939 --> 01:13:04,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a huge fan of the Resistance series on the PlayStation.

840
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 3.

841
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:11,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, at the time, I was kind of comparing that between that and Halo 3.

842
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:16,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually preferred that a lot better because it reminded me of the early...

843
01:13:17,806 --> 01:13:18,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3

844
01:13:36,802 --> 01:14:02,668
[SPEAKER_04]: and they said it was a wonderful concept and just in terms of timing and marketing opportunity it just didn't work and the reason for that is that they were going to go back into the backstory of the Chimeria and what their origins were and that type of stuff but the game itself sounded too similar to The Last of Us and they didn't want those two games overlapping and of course as you know The Last of Us was a runaway success game

845
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:30,636
[SPEAKER_04]: later on so it makes sense that they didn't want to compete with that at the time but they did had they had set up Resistance 3 to essentially end the chapter of the Resistance franchise but leave it open for another game in the future if they were going to go ahead with more Resistance titles but unfortunately they haven't yet which is too bad because I really do like the Resistance games and I really do think it should come back

846
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:33,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember you were a big fan of those years ago.

847
01:14:33,798 --> 01:14:35,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And that series did just kind of fall off.

848
01:14:35,799 --> 01:14:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So I never realized.

849
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:43,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess that makes sense that if it's too similar to another game that Sony's really behind, they wanted to distance that.

850
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:44,224
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's sad.

851
01:14:45,685 --> 01:14:50,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine, though, how that would have been similar to The Last of Us.

852
01:14:51,049 --> 01:14:55,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we're talking more of a stealthy game, that's just a totally different game at that point.

853
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:57,053
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

854
01:14:57,313 --> 01:14:57,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

855
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:00,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll never get to see.

856
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:01,614
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll never get to see.

857
01:15:01,654 --> 01:15:05,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless there was a prototype or something, but it sounds like it didn't even make it that far.

858
01:15:07,728 --> 01:15:12,952
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, some games on Steam, especially in early access, never seem to make it far at all.

859
01:15:13,072 --> 01:15:19,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why there is a new warning on early access games that are considered dead.

860
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:31,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you go to an early access game on Steam and then you end up downloading it and then you kind of find out, oh, wait a minute, this game is not only kind of broken, it hasn't been updated in months.

861
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:37,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So what Valve did to the Steam store was they added something new, which is a warning.

862
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:45,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So a warning will show up on early access games that will tell you how long it's been since the game was last updated.

863
01:15:46,037 --> 01:15:52,603
[SPEAKER_06]: So this warning will appear in what is the big blue early access box that you're used to seeing with early access games.

864
01:15:53,264 --> 01:15:53,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

865
01:15:53,664 --> 01:15:58,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It will have statements from the game's developer about why the game is in early access, which is normal.

866
01:15:58,246 --> 01:15:58,906
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it has.

867
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:08,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But it will also have in orange, it will say how many months or years it's been since the last update went live.

868
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:18,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It also says in quotes in a disclaimer, the information and timeline described by the developers here may no longer be up to date.

869
01:16:20,771 --> 01:16:22,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Zomboid has been cited as an example.

870
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:52,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It is targeting games that were abandoned, such as Unsung Story is a big one.

871
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,321
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a Kickstarter.

872
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:58,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be a successor to Final Fantasy Tactics, and it never got done.

873
01:16:58,803 --> 01:17:01,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now it has a label that says it's been abandoned for four years.

874
01:17:02,145 --> 01:17:05,566
[SPEAKER_06]: So now you can make an informed decision if you want to back that kind of thing or not.

875
01:17:05,706 --> 01:17:08,508
[SPEAKER_06]: So interesting.

876
01:17:08,848 --> 01:17:11,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's good information to have on the Steam store.

877
01:17:11,529 --> 01:17:12,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good way to...

878
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

879
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:37,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gets a magical little upgrade.

880
01:17:37,665 --> 01:17:40,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do want to shout that out and congratulate YYR on getting that released.

881
01:17:41,008 --> 01:17:42,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It must feel very, very good.

882
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So super duper multitasking.

883
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:45,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.

884
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:47,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Support our friend YYR.

885
01:17:47,093 --> 01:17:48,274
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

886
01:17:49,855 --> 01:17:53,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no early access.

887
01:17:53,578 --> 01:17:56,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there was no early access to ruin games.

888
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:58,662
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to roll the bumper right now.

889
01:18:09,457 --> 01:18:16,743
[SPEAKER_00]: and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

890
01:18:17,203 --> 01:18:20,025
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

891
01:18:20,606 --> 01:18:31,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but once a month, DarkSakura likes to flip the script a little bit and this year she is taking a classic game or a console game that became an arcade game.

892
01:18:31,234 --> 01:18:35,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura, what is the classic console to arcade game of the week?

893
01:18:37,399 --> 01:18:38,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus Super Mario Brothers.

894
01:18:40,117 --> 01:18:47,472
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why I was like no spoilers last month my bad what's the first one that came to mind but there's a reason for that

895
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
01:18:51,053 --> 01:18:53,855
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Versus Super Mario Bros.

897
01:18:54,015 --> 01:18:58,878
[SPEAKER_01]: came out in 1986 as an arcade adaptation of Super Mario Bros.

898
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,940
[SPEAKER_01]: that came out on the NES in 1985.

899
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:11,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was released on the Nintendo's Versus system and the Nintendo Versus Unis system and the variant of that, Nintendo Versus Dual system.

900
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:12,888
[SPEAKER_01]: We may talk about those someday.

901
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:24,794
[SPEAKER_01]: The levels were made more difficult, given narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, fewer hidden power-ups, and 200 coins needed for an extra life instead of 100.

902
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:29,096
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a quarter muncher, y'all.

903
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:36,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the new levels that were in it were actually featured in the original Super Mario Bros.

904
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:39,860
[SPEAKER_01]: 2, the Japanese version, not the Doki Doki Panic.

905
01:19:40,941 --> 01:19:41,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

906
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:46,535
[SPEAKER_01]: The arcade version was not actually officially released in Japan.

907
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:54,061
[SPEAKER_01]: There were coin-op versions that was made from a Famicom console that was placed in an arcade cabinet in Japanese arcades.

908
01:19:54,762 --> 01:19:56,263
[SPEAKER_01]: That was by January 86.

909
01:19:57,604 --> 01:20:01,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nintendo, of course, threatened the litigious path

910
01:20:02,568 --> 01:20:20,583
[SPEAKER_01]: and um so but yeah that that kept going in through 87 so outside of Japan versus Super Mario Brothers did officially get released um in early 1986 and it became the first version of the game to get a wide international release

911
01:20:21,863 --> 01:20:28,286
[SPEAKER_01]: It debuted at the 86 Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London.

912
01:20:29,427 --> 01:20:31,728
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first appearance of Super Mario Bros.

913
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:32,208
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe.

914
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:38,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So it went on to be pretty popular.

915
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:40,352
[SPEAKER_01]: It was such a wide release.

916
01:20:40,452 --> 01:20:45,675
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a ROM software conversion kit was how it originally released.

917
01:20:46,335 --> 01:21:13,473
[SPEAKER_01]: it was featured in a contest from the ACME convention in Chicago in March 86 and yeah, basically it became pretty popular and it was the 8th top grossing arcade video game on the US PlayMeter charts in May 86 sold 20,000 arcade units within a few months and became the best selling Nintendo Versus system release

918
01:21:14,654 --> 01:21:27,795
[SPEAKER_01]: basically each unit was averaging more than $200 a week and the 13th highest grossing arcade game in 86 in the US according to replay arcades charts the top of that by the way was Sega's Hang-On

919
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:28,753
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura,

920
01:21:48,349 --> 01:22:14,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this quote it's from Chris Kohler of Kotatsu he said that the game's difficulty was the meanest trick Nintendo ever played um but yeah I mean and it was I think a lot of us this was a lot of people's introduction I think to the Nintendo versus system um which you know I will eventually have to cover that at some point you know like different arcade systems but um

921
01:22:16,926 --> 01:22:19,727
[SPEAKER_01]: There were all sorts.

922
01:22:19,827 --> 01:22:25,369
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually kind of started with Data East having a concept of convertible arcade board systems.

923
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:31,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Sega put out the converted game system.

924
01:22:31,751 --> 01:22:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this eventually led up to it.

925
01:22:35,192 --> 01:22:41,674
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an idea that they had worked on following the video game crash in 83.

926
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:41,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And so...

927
01:22:43,655 --> 01:22:47,498
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the things that led up to this arcade conversion.

928
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:49,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

929
01:22:51,802 --> 01:22:52,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

930
01:22:53,303 --> 01:22:54,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually shocked.

931
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:58,608
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about how they have the conversion on the Nintendo Switch that Hamster did.

932
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And that game is consistently in the top sellers.

933
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:07,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I legitimately think so many people think that versus...

934
01:23:08,456 --> 01:23:30,767
[SPEAKER_06]: well no I think they they're they're misinformed because they think versus Super Mario Brothers or they go oh it was the arcade version it's the same thing or they go oh it's Super Mario Brothers let's get that and they don't realize like the pain that they are about to suffer because this game was truly much harder horribly painful yeah yeah this this game was was torture

935
01:23:31,627 --> 01:23:32,067
[SPEAKER_01]: to play.

936
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:34,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, fun, yes, but torture.

937
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:38,971
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was intended to be a quarter muncher.

938
01:23:40,332 --> 01:23:42,213
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see one in public, don't touch it.

939
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:53,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe touch it and say thank you for your service, but don't play it because you'll lose on 1-1 and then you'll feel really sad about your life and your choices.

940
01:23:53,859 --> 01:23:58,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Just pay $5 for the hamster one on Switch because that way your quarter loss is limited.

941
01:23:58,882 --> 01:23:59,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

942
01:24:00,023 --> 01:24:08,163
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll save money you'll save money, exactly of course the true factor, you save the money you never spend

943
01:24:09,722 --> 01:24:11,023
[SPEAKER_06]: True, true.

944
01:24:11,043 --> 01:24:15,046
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, having played this game... This said from a consumer whore.

945
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:34,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Having played this game a little bit at the roller rink when I was younger, because I remember the pay choice and all that, and this game was in it, and obviously I never got very far and all that, I'm very curious about that part where you're talking about the Japanese Mario 2, or Lost Levels, if you will, that those levels exist in this game.

946
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never really aware of that.

947
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:38,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious which ones they put in.

948
01:24:39,542 --> 01:25:02,590
[SPEAKER_01]: took too much money to even get there nobody's seen it they've spent all the money trying to get there if I'm correct I'm sure it's some of the like the weight level platform levels you know where they're the scales yeah yeah I think a couple of those were included and yeah the game is vicious interesting oh my gosh

949
01:25:04,097 --> 01:25:07,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta be honest, kind of want to play it.

950
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:09,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, like through a fresh set of eyes.

951
01:25:09,699 --> 01:25:13,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure I bought it on Switch, but I didn't get very far because of course I didn't.

952
01:25:14,701 --> 01:25:16,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

953
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:21,923
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some interesting versus games.

954
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:29,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had Tetris and Dr. Mario and Mahjong Wrecking Crew, Ladies Golf.

955
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Clu Clu Land, Excitebike There's just a bunch Yeah, I remember versus Excitebike, that was a huge one So, alright Yeah, versus Castlevania was another one Oh, that's right, third party games started showing up at some point

956
01:25:45,748 --> 01:25:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Top Gun, Platoon That's so funny that versus Castlevania was one when Vampire Hunter's right there which already had a reputation for being hard as fuck.

957
01:25:55,158 --> 01:25:55,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, no, I'm sorry.

958
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

959
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Haunted Castle.

960
01:25:57,781 --> 01:25:59,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I called it something else.

961
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Haunted Castle was right there.

962
01:26:01,792 --> 01:26:04,554
[SPEAKER_01]: But even Valkyrie Noboken was on there.

963
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:09,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Valkyrie didn't say it was Legend of the Valkyrie, but it was the Namco one.

964
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:16,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Xavius, Atari RBI Baseball, Sky Kid, Goonies.

965
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Goonies was Nintendo, but still.

966
01:26:20,067 --> 01:26:20,748
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why...

967
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: we never got that's why when we got Goonies 2 we didn't get a Goonies 1 because Goonies was arcade Goonies 1 was considered the arcade game here yeah so yes uh which I believe was board by board it wasn't like the open worldness of Goonies 2 if I remember right yeah yeah

968
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:47,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyways, a few more stories for you, and then we'll see if maybe we have some Lister Roundtable tonight.

969
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:47,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

970
01:26:47,807 --> 01:26:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a few less people around tonight just because of everything going on in pop culture.

971
01:26:52,329 --> 01:26:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

972
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:54,731
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll offer an opportunity here in a little bit.

973
01:26:54,771 --> 01:27:00,474
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, we have a few more headlines for you that we're going to talk about rapidly in a section called Rapid Fire News.

974
01:27:00,634 --> 01:27:00,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

975
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:26,585
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah uh so football manager 25 has been canceled after how dare you bring up football tonight how dare just kidding it's been well it's been canceled there will be no okay oh there will be no football today yes no football as of right now as of the year 2025 it will be unmanaged football from here on no more football rogue football only rogue football if there's the

976
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's to say what's going to happen?

977
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're just off the rails here now.

978
01:27:32,326 --> 01:27:40,009
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, the developer explained that they were aiming for a high quality game when they announced it.

979
01:27:40,349 --> 01:27:47,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this was come out in March, but they said that they have encountered challenges that made it unable to reach its goal.

980
01:27:49,412 --> 01:27:53,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it was rushing too much and in danger of compromising its usual standards.

981
01:27:54,154 --> 01:27:57,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, they couldn't get a game polished enough.

982
01:27:59,261 --> 01:28:01,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe.

983
01:28:01,702 --> 01:28:09,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know what Football Manager's standards are, but, I mean, you've got to have high standards if you're managing the football.

984
01:28:10,246 --> 01:28:11,926
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the football, so.

985
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:18,029
[SPEAKER_04]: The football, you know, let's not confuse this.

986
01:28:19,029 --> 01:28:23,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, so there will not be a Football Manager 25, but fret not!

987
01:28:25,629 --> 01:28:31,471
[SPEAKER_04]: for It Will Rise Again in 2026 with Football Manager 26.

988
01:28:32,311 --> 01:28:32,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, joy.

989
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:38,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly not 25, but just developed longer with 26 on it.

990
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:42,914
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just throw that in the pile of things that are fucked in 2025.

991
01:28:43,174 --> 01:28:45,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, football.

992
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to just have to manage football on 2024, last year's management.

993
01:28:53,294 --> 01:29:17,025
[SPEAKER_04]: sorry you just have to remember better times you gotta cut back, you gotta play those old sports games you don't need to play every new release back in my day, we had no football manager football managers, yeah it was unmanaged it was all unmanaged chaos it was football chaos, that's it

994
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:46,463
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we've got news that Magic the Gathering is going to be adopted for TV and movies cool that's all I have to say about that I don't know cool hey, we're the first to bring magic to the movies there has not been magic in movies yet until now

995
01:29:47,478 --> 01:29:48,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with TV.

996
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:49,380
[SPEAKER_04]: No magic in TV.

997
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:54,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We are groundbreaking as far as bringing magic to cinema.

998
01:29:54,284 --> 01:29:56,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Cinema has been unmagical up until this point.

999
01:29:58,968 --> 01:29:59,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this.

1000
01:30:00,129 --> 01:30:05,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The Magic of the Gathering universe is pretty lore heavy and has a lot going on.

1001
01:30:05,854 --> 01:30:08,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Even back when I was selling my Black Borders off.

1002
01:30:10,358 --> 01:30:11,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of surprised.

1003
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:13,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's been comics forever.

1004
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:17,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what this is going to be.

1005
01:30:17,961 --> 01:30:18,922
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be something that cashes.

1006
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:22,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be like a Dungeons and Dragons movie that cashes in on this stuff.

1007
01:30:22,565 --> 01:30:23,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1008
01:30:24,226 --> 01:30:31,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it'll be decent because as much as it's easy to sit here and poke fun of it, a lot of recent video game adaptations have been fine.

1009
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Not all of them have been good.

1010
01:30:33,714 --> 01:30:36,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Resident Evil Netflix was a choice.

1011
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:40,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's been some decent video game adaptations that have happened.

1012
01:30:40,839 --> 01:30:41,920
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them recently.

1013
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:42,861
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1014
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:44,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Magic the Gathering

1015
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,717
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I wish I still had mine somewhere.

1016
01:31:05,837 --> 01:31:08,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that thing's worth a lot of fucking money now.

1017
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:13,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to use the candelabra and all that stuff to get the ginormous cards into our decks.

1018
01:31:13,499 --> 01:31:15,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so funny.

1019
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:15,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could play them.

1020
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:22,260
[SPEAKER_06]: SS2100 Matt in chat says, hopefully they have enough colorless mana in play to make this a good movie.

1021
01:31:27,341 --> 01:31:28,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Dad.

1022
01:31:28,181 --> 01:31:32,202
[SPEAKER_01]: This movie funded by the sale of three Mox Jets.

1023
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:37,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if this is modern Hollywood, you can better believe it's going to be colorless mana.

1024
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:40,954
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1025
01:31:43,356 --> 01:31:48,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and extra cost will be covered by a couple of dual lands and a Legends deck.

1026
01:31:49,524 --> 01:31:49,884
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

1027
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:50,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway...

1028
01:31:53,231 --> 01:31:56,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is something actually that Dan and I are pretty excited about.

1029
01:31:56,214 --> 01:31:57,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get it.

1030
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:09,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom Fighting Collection 2 is going to be released for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam on May 16th.

1031
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:10,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcom has said so.

01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:11,529
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order it now.

1033
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:12,730

[SPEAKER_01]: um but it's going to include Capcom vs. SNK Millennium Fight 2000 Pro Capcom vs. SNK 2 Mark of the Millennium 2001 Capcom Fighting Evolution Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper Project Justice yes

[SPEAKER_01]: um you have mid-game saves and uh different balance adjustments and quality of life adjustments for the game so yay yeah I'm excited for this too I'm definitely gonna pick this up yes good stuff all right and then uh we have woke me up to tell me about this it's important

1038
01:33:47,027 --> 01:33:53,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clearly very important to the well-being of our lives and our continued marriage.

1039
01:33:54,293 --> 01:34:00,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also things that are important to music game fans would be the newest things that Harmonix is up to.

1040
01:34:00,618 --> 01:34:05,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And Harmonix, of course, is a part of Epic Games now, which makes Fortnite.

1041
01:34:06,122 --> 01:34:11,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Harmonix and Look North World have released what's called Patchwork Parkour.

1042
01:34:11,967 --> 01:34:14,789
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rhythm game now available in Fortnite.

1043
01:34:15,169 --> 01:34:19,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a single player obstacle course that is available in Fortnite.

1044
01:34:19,454 --> 01:34:21,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an original EDM soundtrack.

1045
01:34:21,796 --> 01:34:25,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of has immersive isometric view and it also has side scrolling mechanics to it.

1046
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:29,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying that this was built in the Unreal editor for Fortnite.

1047
01:34:30,686 --> 01:34:33,910
[SPEAKER_06]: It was built in Patchwork, which is a suite of...

1048
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: and Unreal Editor for Fortnite development tools that will allow creators to build dynamic music and visual experiences.

1049
01:34:44,058 --> 01:34:46,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually built the soundtrack within the tool.

1050
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: It adjusts the music as you go through four phases in this world and navigate more challenging terrain.

1051
01:34:53,024 --> 01:34:54,125
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks interesting.

1052
01:34:54,145 --> 01:34:55,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to try that.

1053
01:34:55,226 --> 01:34:56,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can check it out in Fortnite.

1054
01:34:56,787 --> 01:34:58,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You do have to use a code to get it.

1055
01:34:59,449 --> 01:35:02,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your pen and paper real fast or your rewind button.

1056
01:35:02,532 --> 01:35:02,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1-425-4464-4801.

1057
01:35:03,113 --> 01:35:12,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But I imagine if you log into Fortnite, it's got to be one of the featured worlds right now.

1058
01:35:12,182 --> 01:35:16,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably not too difficult to find, but you can use the rewind button if you need that number again.

1059
01:35:16,867 --> 01:35:23,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Or thanks to us searching, if you look for Patchwork Parkour, you'll probably find that number pretty easy.

1060
01:35:24,326 --> 01:35:29,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well in the meantime, let's travel around and check out some release dates around the world.

01:39:36,215 --> 01:39:42,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the same plus Xbox, Tomb Raider 4 through 6 Remastered.

1095
01:39:45,462 --> 01:39:45,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright!

1096
01:39:48,686 --> 01:39:53,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, curious how many of you out there listening will be picking up one of those games this week.

1097
01:39:53,809 --> 01:39:56,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Civ 7 is a big one, but you heard about some others out there as well.

1098
01:39:57,352 --> 01:40:01,735
[SPEAKER_06]: We love to hear from you throughout the week in our Discord server over at vognetwork.com.

1099
01:40:02,015 --> 01:40:05,017
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also on BlueSky at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1100
01:40:05,097 --> 01:40:08,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can have a custom.com as your BlueSky name, and that's really the way to do it.

1101
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,500
[SPEAKER_06]: to prove it's really you.

1102
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:13,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can also email us anytime.

1103
01:40:13,702 --> 01:40:15,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1104
01:40:16,303 --> 01:40:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to all those interactions in just a little bit.

1105
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, I think Loki has one more story for us.

1106
01:40:22,865 --> 01:40:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1107
01:40:23,345 --> 01:40:30,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So the release date for Melgar's Solid Delta Snake Eater has accidentally been announced.

1108
01:40:30,868 --> 01:40:31,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

1109
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:39,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony accidentally uploaded the trailer that contained the release date to the front page.

1110
01:40:40,176 --> 01:40:41,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

1111
01:40:41,537 --> 01:40:44,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why they had to take the whole goddamn thing down for a day.

1112
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:45,680
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1113
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:47,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Delete, delete, delete.

1114
01:40:50,643 --> 01:40:56,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that whatever game is playing behind you right now just had fire show up right as you are talking about that.

1115
01:40:56,347 --> 01:40:57,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

1116
01:40:57,467 --> 01:40:57,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1117
01:40:59,228 --> 01:40:59,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Twisted Metal.

1118
01:41:00,109 --> 01:41:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1119
01:41:01,775 --> 01:41:20,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's how I imagine that the whole thing went down, is essentially, yeah, there was a fire and they had to, you know, throw water on the server to stop the release date getting leaked out, but it's too late because someone saw it, so now it's out there forever.

1120
01:41:21,771 --> 01:41:25,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So, not that I really care, but what's the date?

1121
01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:29,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the release date is August 28th.

1122
01:41:29,577 --> 01:41:30,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

1123
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:34,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in time for Labor Day.

1124
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1125
01:41:36,554 --> 01:41:37,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't be here to buy it anyway.

1126
01:41:39,116 --> 01:41:44,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for some reason in the trailer, though, it also had an ape escape monkey slapping its butt.

1127
01:41:44,281 --> 01:41:46,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure what that has to do with anything.

1128
01:41:46,984 --> 01:41:51,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's a capturing ape escape monkeys mode.

1129
01:41:51,568 --> 01:41:52,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Counterpoint.

1130
01:41:52,449 --> 01:41:54,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we need that in more trailers.

1131
01:41:56,483 --> 01:41:57,044
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

1132
01:41:57,664 --> 01:42:01,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a tie-in for the movie The Monkey.

1133
01:42:02,448 --> 01:42:06,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the Last of Us Part 3 trailer to hit because we know that's going to happen eventually.

1134
01:42:06,651 --> 01:42:08,653
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need that really super emotional moment.

1135
01:42:09,033 --> 01:42:10,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Last of Us Part 3, the high stakes.

1136
01:42:10,735 --> 01:42:12,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, this is so emotional.

1137
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:12,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to cry.

1138
01:42:13,057 --> 01:42:13,937
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so messed up.

1139
01:42:13,998 --> 01:42:14,858
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, bam!

1140
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Butt slap right at the end.

1141
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon!

1142
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:18,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Boing, boing, boing, boing.

1143
01:42:21,886 --> 01:42:25,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why you just made me think of that character from Toshinden on Saturn.

1144
01:42:27,329 --> 01:42:27,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on Saturn.

1145
01:42:27,889 --> 01:42:29,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, was it Toshinden 3, I think?

1146
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:30,370
[SPEAKER_01]: The butt monkey.

1147
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:31,911
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.

1148
01:42:31,951 --> 01:42:32,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember his name.

1149
01:42:32,911 --> 01:42:36,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We always called him the butt monkey because he would attack with his butt.

1150
01:42:36,313 --> 01:42:38,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dark Tetsuya has a serious answer here.

1151
01:42:38,714 --> 01:42:39,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo.

1152
01:42:39,514 --> 01:42:40,054
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

1153
01:42:40,074 --> 01:42:41,375
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

1154
01:42:42,516 --> 01:42:46,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, what is up with you all fucking wanting facts on your video game podcast?

1155
01:42:46,737 --> 01:42:47,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

1156
01:42:49,431 --> 01:42:53,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I just came here for a good time and I feel so affected right now.

1157
01:42:53,692 --> 01:42:55,212
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1158
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:57,712
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now it makes sense and I don't like it.

1159
01:42:57,732 --> 01:42:58,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1160
01:42:58,153 --> 01:42:59,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to rewind a little bit.

1161
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Snake Eater was technically Metal Gear Solid 3 before, right?

1162
01:43:04,894 --> 01:43:05,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1163
01:43:19,915 --> 01:43:21,035
[SPEAKER_01]: So why isn't it Gamma?

1164
01:43:21,075 --> 01:43:21,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it Delta?

1165
01:43:26,837 --> 01:43:30,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you're asking for more logic, and we've already given you enough tonight.

1166
01:43:30,978 --> 01:43:32,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they tie- Go away.

1167
01:43:32,898 --> 01:43:39,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Product placement tie-in with Delta Airlines, and so now, that's how they're gonna make the money back.

1168
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Fly the friendly skies!

1169
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:41,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Boing, oing, oing, oing.

1170
01:43:43,501 --> 01:43:43,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1171
01:43:44,381 --> 01:43:47,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, Rob, it's Snake Eater, not Snake Beater.

1172
01:43:47,782 --> 01:43:49,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, either could be interchangeable.

1173
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: uh vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room if you'd like to call us tonight we also are happy to take comments from our chat uh over at twitch.tv slash vog network I don't think we had anything on blue sky tonight I will double check I also don't think we had anything in the mailbag either but I sometimes get that wrong no no no we don't how dare next week people

1174
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:58,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I need at least 10 emails about how you love me or at least give me money send us some good photoshops of the ape escape monkey in your favorite video game but not 10 of them listener photoshop challenge if your video game is ape escape no

1175
01:45:02,822 --> 01:45:04,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not going to break down.

1176
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:05,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's true.

1177
01:45:05,604 --> 01:45:09,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, if we don't get email or calls, we talk about Drag Race.

1178
01:45:09,788 --> 01:45:16,273
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100, Matt reminds us, we get to do gay shit if we don't get any emails or whatever.

1179
01:45:16,553 --> 01:45:18,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't really watch Drag Race anymore.

1180
01:45:18,295 --> 01:45:20,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stupid, and I did buy the season of Drag Race.

1181
01:45:20,797 --> 01:45:21,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?

1182
01:45:21,477 --> 01:45:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really watch.

1183
01:45:22,678 --> 01:45:23,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see.

1184
01:45:23,239 --> 01:45:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say, okay, so when I was in Portland...

1185
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:27,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a butthole.

1186
01:45:56,278 --> 01:45:57,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been watching Fashion Photo Review

1187
01:46:22,603 --> 01:46:29,685
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the queens within a week of that did that number in Portland, like with that, but actually did like a full reveal.

1188
01:46:29,745 --> 01:46:33,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So they took the thing off and there was a whole outfit underneath it and it was really well done.

1189
01:46:34,486 --> 01:46:35,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought, yeah, it was a fun performance.

1190
01:46:36,867 --> 01:46:46,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing I learned is that there is a Badlands in Portland and it is the exact same fucking thing right down to what happens each night as the Sacramento one.

1191
01:46:48,755 --> 01:46:49,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it's laid out differently.

1192
01:46:49,996 --> 01:46:50,877
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two.

1193
01:46:50,917 --> 01:46:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just thought that was interesting.

1194
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:52,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow.

1195
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't there another Badlands?

1196
01:46:54,179 --> 01:46:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: In San Francisco.

1197
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Reno is supposed to be getting one if they don't already have one.

1198
01:46:59,483 --> 01:47:01,144
[SPEAKER_01]: But where's our Hamburger Mary's?

1199
01:47:01,224 --> 01:47:03,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the McDonald's of gay bars at this point.

1200
01:47:04,686 --> 01:47:05,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

1201
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:05,627
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's fine.

1202
01:47:05,647 --> 01:47:06,788
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least it's not Faces.

1203
01:47:06,888 --> 01:47:08,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1204
01:47:10,290 --> 01:47:39,277
[SPEAKER_06]: SG-100 Matt did specifically call out the new Gaga song which I will say is really fucking good it is really fucking good so like yeah that's all there is to say about it if not listen to you know I love ABBA but of course I love ABBA Cadabra you need to go listen to that song it's it's great I'm sure I'm sure I say you need to go listen to that song I'm sure it has been forced upon all of you at some week if you have a gay person in your life this song has been forced upon you at some point this week and I would say it's

1205
01:47:39,577 --> 01:47:41,919
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1206
01:48:02,515 --> 01:48:04,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all stopped shitting on Chromatica.

1207
01:48:05,337 --> 01:48:09,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Chromatica gave us the Chromatica 2 to 9-1-1 transition.

1208
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:10,741
[SPEAKER_06]: It was incredible.

1209
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Did y'all forget?

1210
01:48:12,002 --> 01:48:12,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all have amnesia?

1211
01:48:13,223 --> 01:48:19,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It did come out during COVID, so maybe the answer is yes to those questions.

1212
01:48:19,568 --> 01:48:19,768
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

1213
01:48:20,348 --> 01:48:27,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe it's just because she has been gone a few years, you know, doing the acting thing, doing the whole, I'm going to be in the Joker movie.

1214
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:27,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

1215
01:48:28,059 --> 01:48:28,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a stinker.

1216
01:48:30,163 --> 01:48:34,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole stuff, you know, so it's, I would say she's back to form with music.

1217
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: um but she didn't exactly go any it's not like Chromatica was a bad album it's a great album that that duet with Elton John it's like one of my favorite Gaga songs so fucking good even if I fucking love Elton John even if the end turns into um dubstep for no reason uh I love that song you know what though I want you know what you don't know what I want an acoustic album

1218
01:48:58,379 --> 01:48:58,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, from Gaga?

1219
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's the Tony Bennett albums are very close to that.

1220
01:49:02,983 --> 01:49:03,163
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

1221
01:49:03,183 --> 01:49:06,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I want like Oh, her songs instead of jazz standards.

1222
01:49:07,046 --> 01:49:07,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:49:08,287 --> 01:49:11,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Done like piano or acoustic guitar or something.

1224
01:49:11,309 --> 01:49:13,170
[SPEAKER_01]: I want like a Gaga unplugged.

1225
01:49:13,211 --> 01:49:19,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because when she plays things like Poker Face and Paparazzi on the piano, it's so good.

1226
01:49:19,055 --> 01:49:19,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1227
01:49:20,696 --> 01:49:26,758
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also why Gaga legitimately plays all these instruments, writes all her music.

1228
01:49:27,178 --> 01:49:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all know a lot of the pop girlies don't do that.

1229
01:49:29,919 --> 01:49:31,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not here to pit women against each other.

1230
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they hire Kesha to do it for them.

1231
01:49:34,340 --> 01:49:41,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But part of the reason that Gaga is on this different plane is because she's the full package.

1232
01:49:41,823 --> 01:49:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1233
01:49:44,215 --> 01:49:46,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's getting people involved politically, which is a great thing.

1234
01:49:46,437 --> 01:49:52,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And as much as I kind of don't give a hoot about the Grammys, I guess they're trying to work on some of their issues.

1235
01:49:52,522 --> 01:49:59,467
[SPEAKER_06]: The Weeknd forgave them, so I don't have time to watch it, but I'm looking with curiosity what's going on.

1236
01:49:59,507 --> 01:50:02,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously I saw what Gaga said, which was very necessary.

1237
01:50:02,690 --> 01:50:04,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's another reason why we fucking love her.

1238
01:50:05,012 --> 01:50:08,735
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why LGBTQIA, all your rainbow fans,

1239
01:50:09,215 --> 01:50:10,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very happy to hear that

1240
01:50:30,788 --> 01:50:32,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1241
01:50:32,589 --> 01:50:33,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's it.

1242
01:50:33,789 --> 01:50:40,472
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't get a lot of other stuff tonight, but that's because, again, I think a lot of folks are distracted by pop culture things.

1243
01:50:40,672 --> 01:50:41,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you had fun.

1244
01:50:41,872 --> 01:50:44,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope your team sports the way you wanted them to.

1245
01:50:44,953 --> 01:50:46,854
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say, I'm just going to be honest.

1246
01:50:47,574 --> 01:50:48,335
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1247
01:51:01,874 --> 01:51:06,056
[SPEAKER_01]: When Dan woke me up this morning, I mean, he basically woke me up to say it was noon.

1248
01:51:07,116 --> 01:51:09,578
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, I hope both teams lose.

1249
01:51:09,658 --> 01:51:12,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, grumpy cat law.

1250
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:15,900
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to say one thing.

1251
01:51:16,721 --> 01:51:20,543
[SPEAKER_01]: The team that the turd was going for lost.

1252
01:51:22,043 --> 01:51:23,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm happy about that.

1253
01:51:23,344 --> 01:51:24,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know he gave a shit.

1254
01:51:24,764 --> 01:51:25,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I don't give a shit.

1255
01:51:25,785 --> 01:51:26,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he's salty.

1256
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:27,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch is salty.

1257
01:51:28,777 --> 01:51:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bitch is also salty that Time gave the cover to his little Stoogey instead of him.

1258
01:51:35,427 --> 01:51:39,132
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRiteInChat says, we flipped a coin to see what team we should cheer for.

1259
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:41,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I just say I'm glad it didn't land on heads.

1260
01:51:42,256 --> 01:51:43,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have my joke for next week.

1261
01:51:44,059 --> 01:51:46,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have my joke, because you know I'm hosting some shows next week.

1262
01:51:46,521 --> 01:51:49,363
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're here in Sacramento, check out what's going on at the Colonial Theater Friday and Saturday.

1263
01:51:49,383 --> 01:52:01,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got Rocky Horror on Saturday, and we have my Bloody Valentine, Gorlesque performance on Friday, variety show featuring Sigourney Beaver, my favorite drag name ever, from Dragula Season 4 is going to be there.

1264
01:52:02,193 --> 01:52:03,054
[SPEAKER_06]: on Friday.

1265
01:52:03,154 --> 01:52:04,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And I already have one of my jokes.

1266
01:52:04,315 --> 01:52:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to spoil it for you.

1267
01:52:05,175 --> 01:52:05,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready?

1268
01:52:05,455 --> 01:52:08,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say, how many of y'all were watching the Super Bowl last week?

1269
01:52:08,657 --> 01:52:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1270
01:52:09,478 --> 01:52:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think people really gave a shit about either of those teams.

1271
01:52:12,279 --> 01:52:12,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see.

1272
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:14,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Clap if you're rooting for the Eagles.

1273
01:52:15,421 --> 01:52:16,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And I expect it will be dead silence.

1274
01:52:17,082 --> 01:52:19,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Clap if you're rooting for the team from Kansas City.

1275
01:52:19,924 --> 01:52:21,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And I expect it's going to be silent.

1276
01:52:21,085 --> 01:52:24,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say, clap if you're rooting for the asteroid to kill us all in 2032.

1277
01:52:24,547 --> 01:52:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

1278
01:52:24,647 --> 01:52:24,747
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

1279
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:25,027
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

1280
01:52:28,709 --> 01:52:30,070
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you're going to have to look forward to.

1281
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:33,873
[SPEAKER_06]: More Aubrey Plaza inspired jokes.

1282
01:52:35,695 --> 01:52:40,018
[SPEAKER_01]: The real winner was Serena dancing to a diss track about her ex.

1283
01:52:40,498 --> 01:52:41,039
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the winner.

1284
01:52:45,402 --> 01:52:46,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's Serena?

1285
01:52:47,182 --> 01:53:15,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Serena Williams oh the tennis player okay well I'm like there could be a lot of Serenas out there in the world like one of my best friends in grade school is named Serena and I was like oh she's a football fan Serena Woods okay okay yeah dancing in front of everyone to a diss track about her ex that's oh Anne Hathaway was there I do like her and people booing at Taylor Swift

1286
01:53:17,731 --> 01:53:20,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they were booing at her, but they were, and I'm confused.

1287
01:53:20,693 --> 01:53:23,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's trendy to hate her.

1288
01:53:23,995 --> 01:53:27,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't like listening to her.

1289
01:53:27,237 --> 01:53:30,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I am far from being a Swifty, but I'm not like a hater.

1290
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:44,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would actually go so far as to say I'm actually very impressed at she took back those albums that were basically stolen by her label and sold against her will, and she said, you know what, fuck this, and she's taking them back and re-recording them.

1291
01:53:45,289 --> 01:53:46,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a really

1292
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:47,151
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1293
01:53:47,171 --> 01:53:48,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with that.

1294
01:53:48,672 --> 01:53:49,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess last minute stories.

1295
01:53:49,513 --> 01:53:50,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, video games?

1296
01:54:11,785 --> 01:54:12,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay, alright.

1297
01:54:13,128 --> 01:54:13,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Enough.

1298
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:14,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough.

1299
01:54:15,193 --> 01:54:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1300
01:54:15,995 --> 01:54:20,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Football Manager isn't happening anymore and we're all mourning, so isn't that enough?

1301
01:54:20,466 --> 01:54:20,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1302
01:54:22,341 --> 01:54:44,736
[SPEAKER_01]: that means we're doing final thoughts and we're going to wrap it up tonight DarkSakura, not streaming tonight unfortunately I'm not I walked around way too much yesterday and my leg hurts I'm actually on rest for another two weeks so I'm all I'm taking some time tonight I'm just kinda yeah

1303
01:54:48,406 --> 01:54:49,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

1304
01:54:49,508 --> 01:54:49,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Rest up.

1305
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:52,932
[SPEAKER_06]: When your body says no, I don't like to overdo it either.

1306
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:54,614
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I haven't been streaming a lot lately.

1307
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:57,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, I have to be mentally in the right place to do it.

1308
01:54:57,878 --> 01:54:58,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen.

1309
01:54:58,959 --> 01:54:59,299
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fair.

1310
01:54:59,339 --> 01:55:02,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sending you a suggestion real quick.

1311
01:55:05,134 --> 01:55:05,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1312
01:55:06,155 --> 01:55:11,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, meantime, let's go to Loki and get your final thought tonight.

1313
01:55:11,778 --> 01:55:12,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait.

1314
01:55:12,098 --> 01:55:13,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really get your final thought, Jamie.

1315
01:55:13,659 --> 01:55:14,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1316
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I just said why you're not streaming.

1317
01:55:16,081 --> 01:55:17,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no thoughts.

1318
01:55:18,302 --> 01:55:19,643
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no thoughts, only Zul.

1319
01:55:21,144 --> 01:55:21,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

1320
01:55:22,945 --> 01:55:24,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what are your final thoughts?

1321
01:55:25,366 --> 01:55:31,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I told my football team that I manage, unfortunately, you're on your own from now on.

1322
01:55:31,971 --> 01:55:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your best.

1323
01:55:35,751 --> 01:55:36,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Resist.

1324
01:55:36,592 --> 01:55:37,292
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with Matt.

1325
01:55:37,332 --> 01:55:37,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Resist.

1326
01:55:40,454 --> 01:55:41,475
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought.

1327
01:55:44,096 --> 01:55:45,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Gabby Windy.

1328
01:55:45,517 --> 01:55:47,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't expect that any of you know who this woman is.

1329
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:52,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would not blame you because the first – no, Gabby Windy, I'm going to tell you.

1330
01:55:52,582 --> 01:55:53,262
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to look her up.

1331
01:55:53,342 --> 01:55:54,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love her.

1332
01:55:54,663 --> 01:55:58,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I've discovered her through TikTok and the television show The Traitors, which you all know I love.

1333
01:55:58,446 --> 01:55:59,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my trashy reality shows.

1334
01:56:00,147 --> 01:56:00,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing.

1335
01:56:00,847 --> 01:56:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabby Windy –

1336
01:56:02,583 --> 01:56:04,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Rose, her first show was The Bachelorette.

1337
01:56:05,085 --> 01:56:07,126
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really don't give a shit about that show.

1338
01:56:07,186 --> 01:56:08,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to be straight up honest.

1339
01:56:09,027 --> 01:56:13,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way she was introduced on The Traitors, she's like a young Jennifer Coolidge.

1340
01:56:13,971 --> 01:56:15,692
[SPEAKER_06]: She talks just like her.

1341
01:56:15,832 --> 01:56:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: She's very, so somebody asked Gabby Windy, like, oh, what are you known for?

1342
01:56:20,355 --> 01:56:21,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what show are you from?

1343
01:56:21,356 --> 01:56:23,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And she goes, I was on The Bachelor, Bachelorette.

1344
01:56:23,817 --> 01:56:26,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And they go, you know, oh, well, how was that experience for you?

1345
01:56:27,019 --> 01:56:29,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And she goes, well, I'm a lesbian now.

1346
01:56:29,061 --> 01:56:30,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So that should tell you how that went.

1347
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1348
01:56:31,773 --> 01:56:40,034
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's very much her sense of humor and now I get her TikToks all the time and like I got a TikTok of her yesterday going

1349
01:56:40,851 --> 01:56:43,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to go to a meeting at 3 p.m.?

1350
01:56:44,093 --> 01:56:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you?

1351
01:56:45,454 --> 01:56:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had lunch.

1352
01:56:47,135 --> 01:56:48,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm processing.

1353
01:56:49,396 --> 01:56:51,137
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't want to get on a FaceTime.

1354
01:56:51,397 --> 01:56:54,359
[SPEAKER_06]: The fuck I want to get on a FaceTime to talk about solutions.

1355
01:56:54,759 --> 01:56:57,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Send me the fucking Google Slides.

1356
01:56:57,621 --> 01:57:02,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I need you all to look Gabby Wendy up because that is the energy I need all of us to bring in 2025.

1357
01:57:03,144 --> 01:57:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I've decided I fucking love this woman and I stan her very hard and she's the best thing to come out of that TV show.

1358
01:57:08,367 --> 01:57:09,288
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to send me a link.

1359
01:57:09,608 --> 01:57:10,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I will, I will.

1360
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:12,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I love her so much.

1361
01:57:13,370 --> 01:57:15,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I just learned today she has a podcast.

1362
01:57:17,012 --> 01:57:18,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, what is the podcast called?

1363
01:57:18,513 --> 01:57:18,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

1364
01:57:18,953 --> 01:57:21,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm going to do something I've never done.

1365
01:57:22,815 --> 01:57:24,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Gavin with Gabby?

1366
01:57:24,936 --> 01:57:26,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think it is Gavin with Gabby.

1367
01:57:26,457 --> 01:57:26,717
[SPEAKER_06]: No, wait.

1368
01:57:26,757 --> 01:57:29,579
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just made that up.

1369
01:57:30,259 --> 01:57:31,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Long-winded with Gabby Windy.

1370
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:33,841
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name of it.

1371
01:57:34,021 --> 01:57:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I have never, ever plugged a non-indie podcast on this program.

1372
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:58,493
[SPEAKER_06]: so um the latest episode was called chiropractic pervert the episode before that was called after a lesbian breakup with whatever friends and then the episode before that was called I burnt my clitoris I'm down

1373
01:57:59,868 --> 01:58:00,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Love her.

1374
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:01,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I love her.

1375
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:02,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1376
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:02,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1377
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:07,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And the traitors, excellent reality television.

1378
01:58:07,414 --> 01:58:07,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

1379
01:58:07,854 --> 01:58:10,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it the Super Smash Brothers of reality game shows.

1380
01:58:11,077 --> 01:58:19,583
[SPEAKER_06]: That is exactly what it is because it takes people from Survivor, Big Brother, and then reality shows that aren't even really game shows.

1381
01:58:19,663 --> 01:58:21,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what the fuck is this person doing here?

1382
01:58:21,925 --> 01:58:25,728
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Real Housewives, and it's fantastic.

1383
01:58:26,108 --> 01:58:26,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.

1384
01:58:27,608 --> 01:58:28,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right?

1385
01:58:28,748 --> 01:58:31,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabby Windy is the only reason I'm getting up in the morning lately.

1386
01:58:33,110 --> 01:58:34,770
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to get us through the next four years.

1387
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:35,151
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1388
01:58:35,651 --> 01:58:37,891
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, have a wonderful night, everybody.

01:58:41,613 --> 01:58:43,133
