9983	16945	It appears that Sony has turned their change of heart into business-level course correction, no longer requiring compulsory PlayStation Network logins when playing titles on PC.
17125	23527	Of course, signing into PSN does give you goodies, and Sony the right to sell data about you, but what's the little modern sales behaviors between buyers and sellers?
23728	25548	To be clear, I'm no longer talking about players.
25948	27189	Maybe managed democracy works?
27549	29770	Hopefully we're not on the precipice of the first galactic war.
29910	34591	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34791	36912	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice...
39960	42322	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
42382	47045	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
47145	59413	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are live tonight, February the 2nd of 2025, Groundhog Day, episode number 1034, 1034 of our show.
59573	66938	And from what I understood, that groundhog saw the shadow and went back in, which means six more weeks of winter.
67078	69880	So in the words of RuPaul, cue the sniper.
69980	71986	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
77045	80706	That Greyhound was smart and just went, oh, the sun is up.
80886	82047	I'm going back to bed.
82227	82867	Bye, bitches.
83527	88249	Well, I think that groundhog perked up and said, oh, this is what I'm missing out on?
88309	88849	Never mind.
88909	89329	Good night.
89529	90070	Never mind.
90670	91330	America.
93171	96732	Remember that song in that South Park adjacent movie?
96772	99353	I've decided to reword the lyrics.
100373	102475	America, what the fuck?
102955	104316	That's the new lyrics.
104336	105357	America, fuck no.
105497	106558	America, fuck no.
107259	117427	Anyway, let's also say hello to the ever-patriotic Techmaster Loki, who is muted, actually, I believe.
117447	117748	Hello.
118088	118748	Yes, I'm muted.
119129	121070	Microphone, fuck no.
121090	121130	No.
124955	129737	Anyway, oh yeah, PogCulture in chat says, America, fuck that.
132699	133599	Oh lord, alright.
133920	134420	You know what?
134640	135060	You know what?
135120	135520	Fuck it.
135640	137261	It's a video game show.
137721	139062	Let's just jump right on in.
139182	152069	I got tangents at the top of the show, but I'm looking in chat, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
152329	152429	Um...
153547	160211	Big question in chat and, you know, with what's going on in the world, I don't, I mean, I completely understand why people are asking this.
160611	164654	E3VL asks in chat, are video games going to be more expensive due to tariffs?
165735	166875	Fair question.
167256	168116	That's the best part.
168376	169197	Everything is.
171271	183580	I actually tend to disagree that the hardware will, certainly.
184460	186702	Depending on, and the big question is...
187182	191587	Has Nintendo already started making those Switch 2s or not?
191867	200896	That's like what a big... Because if they have had to bring in the parts and so forth, although I'm sure they're building them overseas, but I'm not sure exactly what country.
200916	202858	I don't know if they build them in China or if they build them...
203519	204240	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
219895	222036	So much is digital distribution.
222756	234959	And what I think is going to happen is that with all these tariffs, you know, if Mexico is going to be more for the discs and all this stuff or wherever, it's probably going to push even more to digital distribution, I think is ultimately what happens.
235019	241121	Because there, you know, especially in the indie front, you know, video games on itch.io are not going to change price.
242181	266515	DLC is not going to change price you see what this does is obviously obviously the price of games are going to go up so significant and this is why we need to have on $100 GTA 6 certainly it's not all the tariffs but certainly we're going to use this as an excuse and it's going to be so weird because when those tariffs go away
267415	268676	Whoa, whoa, hold on.
268716	271138	Why are the game prices not coming down again?
271158	272438	What's that all about?
272538	274720	Oh, it's because there's an excuse.
275260	286668	Or they're going to say that they're going to use DLC and online media and press costs across the whole spectrum to make up for it or some shit.
287128	302381	or you just tell them to go fuck themselves and you're gonna play indie games that are gonna charge you $100 for a game that may or may not have a roadmap at launch to fix the game to bring it to a whole game like it's just it's stupid that they demand more money for this stuff to be fair
303001	331965	you know with itch.io yeah I'm saying oh the indie games and digital games the cost of that isn't going to go up but you know if this whole thing starts to spiral where the cost of this is going up the cost of that is going up then actually in time indie games may cost more because those indie developers deserve to you know have their money and and make their living and they're going to need more money in order to buy that stuff and we'll see what happens because one big thing about that is they're going to have to upgrade their equipment sometime oh yeah yeah yeah good point
332639	343187	Well, if the United States essentially tanks their economy with all these bad decisions, I mean, because obviously these decisions don't make any sense whatsoever, they may reverse course on this stuff.
343387	346949	Then again, they may not because they're like, oh, well, we can't look stupid.
346969	351052	Too late, but like, you know, you never know.
351093	358278	They've been going, like, even on the whole tariff thing, they were going back and forth, like, it was like, yeah, we are.
358378	359579	Oh, no, wait, we're going to wait until March.
359659	360399	No, we are.
360499	360800	It's like...
362221	363747	It's chaotic over there.
363948	366539	And the turd thing is like, I'm just gonna go ahead and do it.
367822	371645	And it is important to state, we are recording live on February 2nd.
371725	374467	These things are not supposed to go into effect until February 4th.
374848	376629	Could there be a last minute miracle?
377530	378451	Maybe, maybe not.
378591	383795	There tends to be, you know, if something changes, it tends to be at the midnight hour.
383995	389279	So, you know, there could be something, but I'm, this is just one of those things.
389299	392602	I'm out of breath to hold for the next four years.
392822	394143	I am out of breath.
394844	396505	So, what can you do?
397506	399688	Anyway, I just want to answer that question.
399928	402150	It's something that a lot of people are thinking about right now.
402250	407714	But my advice to you is that if you really want to have a Switch 2 upon release, start saving.
408535	411337	If physical media is important to you, start saving.
411578	416101	But you might want to also think about the next year or so might be really good for the backlog.
416121	418063	But that could be very bad for the industry.
418103	420505	You know, the industry's already been struggling with a lot of game sales.
420525	423847	We've had a lot of games that have not been performing up to these...
424548	428009	and questionable expectations the company set for it.
428729	432390	I had another tangent, but this is a perfect transition into our kickoff topic.
432410	437571	So I'll orange launch Foodio later because on this, we've got to get into our kickoff topic tonight.
438411	446473	Loki, I know you've got a story here and DarkSakura, I would be hard pressed to believe you don't have an opinion on this because I know this is a studio you care a lot about.
447013	447753	Loki, what's going on?
448689	451652	So Bioware is doing even more layoffs.
451912	458558	They're laying off the core team after basically ending support for the Dragon Age Veilguard.
460099	467386	Apparently that underperformed quite a bit, and now they are entirely working on the next Mass Effect game.
467526	494148	says that it's being developed by the core team under the guidance of series veterans and says in keeping with our fierce commitment innovation during the development and delivery of Mass Effect we have challenged ourselves to think deeply blah blah blah that's a bunch of PR crap let's see it says yeah essentially that they're just not going to work on Dragon Age anymore so they get rid of that team that was behind that yeah it says uh
495871	517249	apparently according to the writing team it would have been better yeah according to Bloomberg it says the studio now has fewer than 100 employees after dozens were laid off and dozens more permanently moved to other EA studios the cuts include veteran staff like writer Trick Weeks who worked on Mass Effect and Dragon Age for decades yeah yeah
520015	522056	Who I don't think is very happy about this.
522156	526017	I follow them on the blue skies.
527858	533640	DarkSakura, you know, I kind of wanted to let you have the floor for a minute because I know you stream Dragon Age.
533760	536061	You've been a fan of this series for a long time.
536561	538082	Certainly you've had a reaction to all this.
540382	541403	Yeah, I'm...
543956	544576	Vailgarden
574076	580879	Wasn't Veil Guard supposed to have been a live service game and then they pivoted into single player?
581780	584041	No.
584241	586302	It depends what rumors you want to believe.
588523	600868	Multiplayer has always been an afterthought when it comes because they had multiplayer in Inquisition but no, it's all been single player every last one of them including this one.
600888	602069	That's the intent from the beginning.
602515	603955	I get that and that makes sense.
603995	605676	That's where it should be as in single player.
605696	617438	It's just EA is greedy as hell and they want more live service games and so I could see them trying to push this to be a live service game and then pivoting again because Anthem.
618218	630060	It's not going to work with Anthem so maybe the expectations for how it should have performed took into account the live service revenue that they would have
630951	660034	and so there's like no way for this to perform even though it even underperformed I think what it you know a single player game would have done well I can give you a little bit more behind that is that there was definitely some bad writing decisions and they didn't have the original writing team and people knew it people were waiting for the first the first reviews of the game and basically a lot of us really did kind of you know poop on it a bit
661773	671310	they made it I mean I think it's still I still have a lot of fun playing it I'm still enjoying it but I think that they made lots of mistakes when when making the game
673231	697943	Questbuster in chat with a really interesting comment here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says worried about Mass Effect but growing interest in that upcoming Exodus game by one of the Bioware veterans that's a very interesting perspective too is that maybe at this point Bioware somewhat feels like a lost cause and to me it all comes back to Anthem but I didn't I didn't hate Dragon Age like Dragon Age is fine but I understand that it's
699028	703997	I understand it kind of took things in a different direction, just handled things differently.
704098	706001	How many of the original teams even left?
706883	708466	Oh god, who knows at this point.
709261	736602	you know but also think about how many years it's been since the last Mass Effect or Dragon Age it wasn't Inquisition the classic game of the week it's at least 10 years old you know so so and as is Mass Effect 3 I think was what 2012 question mark it's it's a pretty old game at this point yeah it's been a while I mean honestly I think that that Mass Effect is going to be their like last ditch effort to save the company I agree and they gotta make it really amazing yeah
737282	737903	And I hope it is.
737923	742307	And I think in that engine they used for Dragon Age.
742367	745450	I mean, Dragon Age was a very good looking game and it's very fluid.
745690	749334	And so I'm excited to see what Mass Effect might look like there.
749414	750935	But yeah, if the writing is kind of...
752220	754542	The writing was so strong in the original trilogy.
754582	757824	I'm just worried for what's going to happen in the new one.
758304	767230	And then, of course, I'm completely leaving Andromeda out of the conversation, which Andromeda's biggest problem was that it was more half-baked.
767510	769352	I think EA rushed that game out.
769372	770252	We all know that, right?
770512	778538	They forced deadlines on that game that it wasn't ready for, and then the product that we got was not a fully-baked product, and it suffered ever since.
778938	781560	It was never able to be the game that people wanted it to be.
782400	785662	So, I don't know.
786543	793828	I think most of us were hoping, foolishly perhaps, that 2025 was going to be a different tone in this industry.
793908	803634	Because this strikes me as, okay, this is our first big layoff story of 2025, when last year was just week after week after week.
803774	806976	And maybe the hope was, maybe it'll be different this year, but...
808234	808774	Apparently not.
809455	814598	And now with everything else we just talked about at the top of the show, how much more is this industry going to suffer?
814658	817699	Because the AAA model cannot sustain itself.
818540	826184	And as much as Loki's joking about $100 Grand Theft Auto VI, the AAA model cannot sustain itself.
826244	828265	You know, other games they say didn't meet expectations.
828305	831247	Apparently Final Fantasy XVI didn't meet expectations either.
831647	832888	And that game was fine.
833868	834789	But, you know, it's...
835984	836524	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
861610	865691	and the games that are huge runaway successes are the ones that are made on a shoestring budget.
866291	873754	Your Stardew Valleys, your Minecrafts, your Five Nights, your games that are made for vampire survivors.
874014	878315	They're made for hardly anything because it's a very small team and they go viral.
878675	880375	They just make oodles and oodles of money.
881116	881696	Get to work.
882576	882776	Yeah.
883696	888818	It's a perfect example of just games that are meant for the streaming audience.
890387	893130	Yeah, unless, unless you're mad.
893170	906442	I mean, it's not to say every AAA game flops, but you know, unless you are like a mad, I don't even know, how did those, didn't actually, the EA free, their first non-FIFA game, I don't think met expectations either.
906722	910126	EAFC, whatever they call it, didn't meet expectations either.
910765	919427	Well, what I would like to know with these expectations is what fucking stupid analyst is creating these expectations?
919447	920387	That is a great fucking question.
920407	926808	If they are missing the mark every time, because the whole point as an analyst is you're supposed to guess, this is what we think this is going to do.
926828	931109	If you fuck up that much every single time, then you need to get fired.
931169	938070	You need to be one of those that's hitting the road, because you obviously don't know what this industry is or how it operates if it's like,
938430	939911	Well, we're just disappointed again.
940552	945516	Especially when we're talking about Square Enix and Tomb Raider, where it's sold 3 million copies.
946016	948058	Well, that's just not enough.
948138	950179	What the fuck do you mean it's not enough?
951300	954243	My impression is that it comes down to this.
954663	959086	Well, because Fortnite made this much, we're expecting to make this much.
959106	959787	It's a different fucking game.
959967	960267	I know.
960347	968689	That's like saying that like, you know, Beast Game didn't get so many views, but the Super Bowl has all of these, and clearly those are the same.
968749	969889	Like, no, it's not.
969989	974871	It's like, it's too it's a different type of game altogether.
974951	976471	Like, you cannot compare that stuff.
976511	982612	And once again, if your analyst thinks it's a good idea to compare those two, he's a fucking moron and needs to get fired.
983493	984053	There you go.
985193	989314	From one analyst to another, you're a fucking moron if that's how you do your calculations.
993044	993744	It's spicy tonight.
994204	994805	I know, I know.
994885	998147	Hecton Chat says, is it an analyst or is it their finance department?
998247	1000549	I mean, all of the above in many cases.
1000569	1001290	It doesn't matter.
1002751	1014179	Whoever is making these projections, what I think is happening is they're allowing these projections to be very high so that their investors put more money into their company and their stock price goes up.
1014219	1015860	And that's really what's important to them.
1016361	1021885	And when they don't meet the mark, it gives them excuse to fire more people, which also makes the stock price go up.
1022205	1032015	and that's what it is it's all in service to the stock price and your shareholders not the game industry they don't give a shit about that
1032981	1034122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1057381	1086605	I think that that is actually a really good response to everything going on because especially in light of everything we were talking about at the top of the show which could drive the price of hardware through the fucking roof now is an opportunity for cloud gaming potentially to get you know not that it doesn't exist but to even you know catch more fire behind it and run those types of things and I think being able to deliver that sorts of things to every experience is going to be even more important and I think it's you know
1087205	1094088	I think part of the reason Final Fantasy XVI didn't meet expectations was limiting itself to PlayStation 5.
1095289	1101772	And I think anything that limits itself to one console, maybe Nintendo excluded, but I'll come back to that.
1102272	1107215	Anything that limits itself to one console is going to be in trouble at this point.
1107315	1109196	It's not the same industry anymore.
1110116	1111277	It's a dumb strategy.
1111317	1112717	Let's just think about this.
1112757	1113338	Let's say...
1114600	1126215	I'm PlayStation, okay, and I'm going to have maybe four, let's talk about like at the launch of, PlayStation 6 is coming out, and let's say I've got five exclusive titles within the first two years of that console.
1127116	1129539	So first off, let's talk about the console.
1130020	1130800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1151854	1169197	you know, however many games people buy because I know, I don't buy a ton of games on consoles anymore and let's just say that, you know, you're purchasing 5 games a year or something like that, 10 games or something like that so they're making a few percentage points off of 10 games total throughout the entire year, is that really...
1169878	1175420	It's advantageous to then also cut out an entire market of hundreds of thousands of people.
1175460	1181483	So you may make 10 more sales from this person, but you're losing hundreds of thousands on everything else.
1181583	1182403	It doesn't make sense.
1183304	1189947	And I think nowadays, especially with PC, if you're smart, it's like, well, I don't need to even get a console.
1189967	1193188	Just wait for everything to come to PC because it eventually does for the most part.
1193888	1194248	I don't know.
1194529	1194789	It's just...
1196166	1207386	they're going to have to switch strategies because like you said before it's not a sustainable business model anymore they need to pivot or die is what's going to happen
1208567	1210468	Now, I mentioned before Nintendo.
1210548	1218492	Nintendo sort of can get away with, you know, time and time again, we can sort of say Nintendo ought to put their games on PlayStation and PC, but they don't, and they don't need to.
1218912	1229158	Because Nintendo just has this chokehold on the market, whether it is their very strong, you know, first party identity, such as, you know, it's...
1229998	1230599	They're the Disney.
1230639	1232540	What Disney is to movies, Nintendo is to games.
1232980	1237602	You know, tale as old as time in this industry is that Mario is as iconic as Mickey Mouse.
1238143	1244366	Link and Zelda in that franchise is as iconic as, you know, The Little Mermaid or, you know, Beauty and the Beast or some of that stuff, right?
1244767	1248128	So Nintendo is always sort of in this different position.
1248489	1250650	Yeah, and Bobby actually has another interesting point.
1250950	1254252	Nintendo's financial analysts are also more realistic, right?
1254412	1255032	What's that about?
1255313	1258574	Could it be... Well, could it be that Nintendo's in another country?
1258614	1260335	Could it be that Nintendo's in another country?
1260876	1262076	Sony's in another country.
1262276	1268920	Why can't they once again, you know... And, you know, when we're talking like Final Fantasy, Square Enix is certainly in a different country.
1270141	1270601	It's just...
1271950	1286666	It's, I think overall, the way Nintendo kind of, aside from social media, let's not talk about social media and how they handle content creators, but like most things when it comes to business, they seem to handle better than other gaming companies.
1286707	1290471	I think a lot of gaming companies could learn from Nintendo as a model, but
1291701	1293223	Thank you for watching!
1314203	1317126	It's very obvious that it's profits first.
1317166	1318927	They're like, well, no.
1318987	1320208	It's like, come on, man.
1320448	1323510	It's so transparent what you're doing nowadays.
1323810	1324951	It just doesn't make any sense.
1325192	1326452	That's why they're successful.
1326492	1331236	That's why no one can touch them because they just do it right.
1331316	1334919	I don't understand why other companies couldn't do this.
1334979	1335759	Some companies have.
1335960	1337581	Sony used to have some really strong IPs.
1338281	1342424	Microsoft has a ton of strong IPs, but they haven't done a lot with them.
1342444	1342564	Halo...
1344619	1351036	Fuck, man, like... That... I'm glad there's another one coming, but shit, man, it... Well...
1353014	1358356	I'm convinced that Halo Master Chief Collection will absolutely be a Switch 2 launch title.
1358376	1358356	100%.
1358536	1361316	And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
1362937	1364317	But I've had a pretty good track record lately.
1365137	1369398	But all egoists are like, well, okay, speaking of predictions, you want me to make another bold prediction?
1369478	1375080	Here's the thing that I come back to, is that with Nintendo and the fact that they...
1376401	1381064	are kind of immune from this whole, they don't need to put their titles on other consoles.
1381485	1384687	They are really tied to the performance of their hardware.
1385027	1389331	And I think we saw this with the Wii U. Like obviously that's why the Wii U was written off so quickly.
1389391	1393374	When they couldn't move that hardware, they couldn't move that software.
1393734	1394695	And then what did they do?
1394755	1402922	They ported like 80% of that software back over to the Switch to kind of recoup those losses years later when they did have a console that was successful.
1403442	1406085	So it really is important that the Switch 2 is strong.
1406505	1409388	And the Breakman in chat says the Switch 2 should be strong enough.
1409748	1410409	I do agree.
1410549	1417656	I don't think the Switch 2 is going to have a problem except for the topic that was just under discussion at the top of the show.
1418697	1426685	If we do end up in a situation where the Switch 2 is going to get subject to tariffs and it's going to drive up the price of that console, here's my prediction.
1427853	1432497	I think most people are assuming that console is going to cost about $400, right?
1433137	1434999	Let's say there's a 25% tariff.
1435039	1436700	And again, it's on some of the parts.
1437641	1438642	Here's what I think happens.
1439403	1447950	They're going to end up charging like $479 for that console, but they're going to package in Mario Kart 9.
1449451	1450691	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1472796	1474698	and Mike Deft says, I don't think they'll bundle a game.
1474878	1477601	I don't think they do either unless this tariff thing because here's the thing.
1478001	1483506	I think Nintendo would be willing to write off the cost of Nintendo 9 because moving... Jesus Christ.
1483846	1491474	I think Nintendo would be willing to write off the cost of Mario Kart 9 because moving the hardware is that important.
1492034	1511088	and they could still make money from Mario Kart 9 if it's as huge as we all expect it's going to be selling DLC, tracks, racers, all that shit it's not like that game is going to fucking print money one way or the other Nintendo can afford to bundle it in to hide the tariff cost to still sell that console
1511724	1518426	I still think, though, it's possible that we may not even see tariffs on it, because right now they haven't really targeted Japan for tariffs.
1518486	1521868	It's been China, Europe, Canada, Mexico.
1522808	1525209	So, I think... Well, Japan won't get the bundle.
1526729	1535472	Well, I'm just saying, I don't know if the cost of goods... I understand a lot of that stuff's manufactured in China, but I don't think they're looking that deep into it.
1535572	1538333	It's like... I don't know.
1538413	1538913	We'll see.
1539193	1539634	Who knows?
1539734	1540414	Like, God, like...
1542324	1546166	It feels like it's been years already and it's only been a few weeks.
1546266	1547507	So, like, who knows?
1547827	1549868	Like, honestly, at this point, I don't know.
1550388	1555091	Yeah, Bonds006 in chat says, have to say Rob's math sounds right.
1555151	1555451	Thank you.
1556251	1560594	The industry will pivot to bundle, thus to soften the blow to players.
1560754	1563575	That's, you are extracting the key point here.
1564116	1567918	They're gonna throw in that little extra to sort of
1571239	1597234	I hope to fuck we aren't sitting here at the end of summer when that Switch 2 is anticipated to release beginning or end of summer let's say it's the end of June or something like that whether it's there or August or whatever releases I hope these tariffs aren't a fucking problem then and then all of this is for naught but if they are, I think bundles is how we start to look to hiding that cost a little bit
1598806	1600167	No, I think it's a good idea.
1600347	1607032	It's certainly, you know, I don't see it as a bad thing to, like, bundle that stuff in.
1607192	1607632	I don't know.
1608052	1608613	We'll see.
1609593	1610494	And let's be honest.
1610794	1611275	Let's be honest.
1611915	1617019	Who, and I know somebody's going to raise their hand up and say, me, fine.
1617199	1618720	There's always somebody different in the crowd.
1619060	1625925	But in the mass video game fan population, who is going to buy a Switch 2 and not buy Mario Kart 9?
1628666	1629547	Can I raise my hand now?
1629967	1634830	I don't enjoy the Mario Kart games that much, Rob.
1634890	1635250	Alright.
1637111	1640993	But I just, you know, it is, but okay, we can say this.
1641453	1643214	It is the top-selling game on the Switch.
1644235	1649318	You know, there are many, many, many, many people that do enjoy Mario Kart, so the bundle thing does make sense.
1651299	1651819	But we'll see.
1651899	1653040	I mean, I hope it doesn't come to that.
1653160	1655221	I just think that's how Nintendo responds to it.
1655241	1657943	The other thing, if we don't all have bigger problems going on,
1658240	1658540	True.
1659701	1659961	True.
1660701	1673307	You know, if we're not in an even bigger recession, or there's a lot that can happen between now and then, and thinking about it is kind of overwhelming.
1673528	1674228	Yeah, I get it.
1675567	1678189	E3VL says they're not going to bundle top selling game.
1678489	1684233	That's absolutely what the strategy was in the 80s with, you know, Mario Brothers, Duck Hunt and all that.
1684293	1691138	Now, some of that was more like trying to like more like a proof of getting this thing in the door and all that stuff.
1691198	1701084	But I think there's some of that in that is that sometimes you do bundle your game and or or look at the didn't did Wii Sports come with the Wii?
1701144	1701785	I guess it didn't.
1702205	1702405	Yes.
1702525	1703006	No, it did.
1703206	1703646	It did.
1704106	1704607	That's right.
1704707	1707949	And it was, you know, obviously the top performer on the Wii.
1708009	1708230	Yeah.
1708310	1708850	Thank you, Bobby.
1708910	1710671	I think that was just because it was bundled in.
1710731	1711512	I couldn't remember.
1711712	1713073	It was essentially a tech demo.
1713133	1719638	I mean, like, yeah, but it was like, but it was, you know, everybody at that time, look, retirement homes and Wii bowling.
1719878	1724321	That was like unheard of right in the gaming industry at that point, video game consoles and retirement homes.
1724802	1729925	So like, you know, that Wii sports, whether, you know, you personally do or don't like it.
1730786	1735510	It came through in a society pop culture kind of way that not a lot of video games have done.
1737592	1738193	And it's interesting.
1738213	1739894	They've never been able to replicate that success.
1740455	1745119	I know that there have been sequels to Wii Sports and none of them have had as big of a blip as the original.
1745179	1745979	It's very interesting.
1746480	1748041	Maybe that is because it was a bundle.
1748261	1748602	I don't know.
1749082	1749483	Hard to say.
1750612	1753737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1766915	1768156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1783630	1784571	I got a nap at least.
1785172	1790896	But one of the things I got to do in Portland while I was walking around... Unfortunately, I did not get to go to the Pinball Museum up there.
1791136	1792937	I contemplated taking the train over there.
1792977	1795118	I did not have my car and that was a mistake.
1795479	1797320	I think next time I go to Portland, I'm going to drive.
1797920	1801103	I had enough to do to entertain me through the weekend, but I think...
1801943	1810205	Next time I would take my car up there or rent a car, I guess, but probably just drive up there or whatever so that I could go out to Hillsboro and go to that big pinball museum.
1810525	1820067	So I could go to Astoria like every 80s kid and go see the Goonies, you know, the museum, the film museum there that was the sheriff's building in the original movie and all that shit.
1820667	1821868	But do not go to the house.
1821988	1823008	They will chase you off.
1823268	1825168	I thought I heard the house has new owners.
1825228	1827249	I have a friend that lives in Astoria.
1827589	1828630	Oh, I thought they had new owners.
1828710	1832554	Like, I know the old owners did that, but I thought they had new owners that were a little more warm to that stuff.
1833475	1834416	Not to my knowledge.
1834736	1841503	People are still, I think, like, you have to, like, schedule something or pay some fee to take a picture in front of the house or something.
1841523	1844926	I'm surprised that that hasn't been purchased by some, like,
1846141	1851025	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1870580	1875341	For the first time when I was in Portland, I went to the mall because no sales tax up there.
1875722	1877302	So I was like, ooh, what am I going to buy?
1877682	1881543	Sadly, I didn't really see a lot because a lot of stores were closed at the downtown mall.
1881563	1883664	They had a Zara, which is a store I like to shop at.
1883804	1884784	It had H&M.
1884824	1885385	I like that too.
1885405	1887965	But I didn't really see anything that really jumped out to me.
1888465	1892887	But in the basement, they had a big food court and they had a Raising Cane's.
1893587	1894327	Sonic Cafe Sonic Speed
1913092	1914753	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1942723	1944465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1963026	1979830	and I don't know if it was just because there are so many people in the freaking line there but maybe they weren't cooking it thoroughly or something but the fries were not good and the chicken was half-assed in my opinion too it was not very good it reminded me of Carl's Jr.
1979910	1989832	chicken tenders which in my opinion were better why are people standing in line for chicken that is worse than fucking Carl's Jr.
1989872	1991733	which isn't exactly A-tier fast food
1994246	1994926	I guess so.
1994986	1998007	Because, Rob, people don't want to get left out.
1998247	1999028	I guess so.
1999128	2001689	People love a queue.
2002749	2003289	I guess.
2003309	2007851	If five people line up, there's other people who are going to say, what are y'all waiting for?
2008191	2008991	Is there a line here?
2009011	2010972	And they're going to queue up too.
2011712	2018455	We got one in front of the old Toys R Us that's now Hobby Lobby over here locally.
2019554	2020235	Jollibee
2040384	2041924	I haven't had Jollibee yet, somehow.
2041944	2046505	Okay, Rob, there is a Jollibee almost around the corner from my house.
2046565	2048006	Yeah, okay.
2048386	2053007	So, if you get over here at some point, we're going to Jollibee.
2053167	2053987	Alright, sounds good.
2054948	2059729	Let's see, other comments in chat about the food, because somebody, so Breakman says, I don't use any sauces.
2060489	2063149	That's, I, you know, and I don't need sauce.
2063370	2063830	I don't.
2064330	2065810	But I just really didn't like.
2066150	2067551	Yes, I did not care for Raising Cane's.
2067931	2068651	I will give it this.
2069588	2071770	The Texas Toast was bomb.
2072431	2074212	It was completely unhealthy.
2074272	2079698	You could taste the butter and the cheese just dripping off that shit, but that's what makes it good.
2081719	2083962	So that was the thing I will give Raising Gaze.
2084002	2086124	Is it Sizzler-style Texas Toast?
2087004	2087305	Yes.
2087705	2087945	Yes.
2088706	2089606	It was pretty fucking good.
2089626	2092067	Like with the with like the burnt cheese on top type of thing.
2092227	2092707	Yes.
2092827	2093768	Yes, it was.
2094428	2095888	So that part I will give.
2095928	2097129	Let's go to Sizzler right now.
2097429	2098149	Bye.
2098229	2098609	Bye.
2098829	2099309	End of show.
2099409	2100169	Orange Lounge Sizzler.
2100950	2104031	Wait, there was another comment here I wanted to get here.
2104171	2107232	Oh, SG100 Matt says people feel the same way about Shake Shack.
2107312	2108012	Not worth the hype.
2108871	2109911	I'm okay with Shake Shack.
2110131	2111472	It's fine, but it's overpriced.
2111772	2112572	That's my biggest complaint.
2112592	2113532	It's overpriced and greasy.
2113792	2114573	It's really greasy.
2115433	2116553	I was not super impressed.
2116573	2117393	I like Steak and Shake.
2117613	2118494	We had that in Mobile.
2118814	2119354	Steak and Shake.
2120554	2123495	See, living in California... Eggnog milkshakes year-round, Rob.
2123775	2128116	Living in California, I also think In-N-Out is one of those places that's really overpriced.
2128156	2128656	It's fine.
2128736	2133738	In-N-Out is fine, but I don't understand the hype where people, when they come to California, go,
2136302	2138003	I am the person that would go to Crystals
2161974	2189470	at 3 in the morning with my drunk ass friends because we don't have White Castle in Alabama we had Crystal and they had Corn Pups and they were fucking good when you're half drunk I would eat Raising Cane's every day, every meal the rest of the month than ever have White Castle again that is the most garbage thing I've ever put in my mouth and I've had a lot of garbage in my mouth alright well
2190799	2193642	I do want to try it someday, just to say that I've tried it.
2194603	2196064	Vegas was how I had it.
2196685	2197546	We have one in Vegas.
2198466	2199648	Freezer section at Walmart.
2199848	2202550	Yeah, but the frozen ones aren't as good.
2203051	2205013	Actually, from the fast food place.
2205033	2207115	The frozen one's not good, but...
2209049	2213454	I would actually say the best drunk food is... Man, I hate Jack in the Box.
2213534	2215116	I think Jack in the Box is the best drunk food.
2215437	2222846	I ate tacos there once and I held it up and oil poured from it like it was coming from my Keurig.
2224414	2228497	But that's like Gym Boys, which is a very local thing, and I fucking love a Gym Boys taco.
2228577	2230278	And Gym Boys makes me fucking sick.
2230318	2231179	Yeah, I know.
2231379	2231799	I like Gym Boys.
2231819	2234681	I told you the story about my first experience with Gym Boys.
2234741	2237023	Look, like, there's two people in this world.
2237063	2242406	The people that love Gym Boys, and the people that immediately shit for an entire day after they ate Gym Boys.
2242526	2245809	And I, look, there's... You mean an entire day?
2247210	2247710	I'm going to...
2249130	2255614	Yeah, my first experience was before having a cell phone that was worth anything, and it was very boring.
2256615	2261578	The thing that pisses people off about gym boys is that they use American cheese in their tacos.
2261678	2262919	That's what pisses people off.
2262939	2263720	That's disgusting.
2263780	2270704	I understand that part, but there's something about that Parmesan cheese mixed in in the shell that's just so freaking good.
2271505	2271765	Anyway.
2273305	2285309	There you go, your Orange Lounge Foodio fast food talk for the week, but I had to get it off my chest that I just, I'm not, I'm gonna call it oatmeal and raisin canes because that's how I feel about the chicken.
2285349	2287369	It's about as exciting as an oatmeal raisin cookie.
2288430	2291210	But, you know what is superior to all of it?
2291470	2292511	Every single last bit of it.
2294091	2294851	Waffle House grits.
2297352	2299173	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2299753	2303134	You may shake your head, you may scoff, but you are wrong
2303626	2304006	Scoff.
2305208	2305649	Scoff.
2307251	2308492	Shun the disbeliever.
2308793	2309354	Shun!
2309454	2310034	Shun!
2311677	2312237	I mean, I don't know.
2312257	2315482	I've never been to Waffle House drunk, and I imagine it's a different experience.
2315642	2318385	So maybe... I've never been to Waffle House.
2318465	2319627	I do love waffles.
2320628	2320829	So...
2321618	2322358	Alright, rules.
2322679	2327502	If you go to Waffle House, order your waffle well done, because otherwise it is a little soggy in the middle.
2328062	2333265	But you get your grits, you get them plain, you have a runny egg in it, no butter or anything, just a runny egg.
2333785	2344212	You mix your egg in and let it, what's the word I'm thinking of, temper the egg when you mix it in, and it makes the grits taste so good and creamy and absolutely delightful.
2344952	2345853	Mmm, so good.
2346593	2349095	For the record, Papa John's is not owned by Papa John anymore.
2351024	2355509	Waffle House is one of those things where I'm like, I wouldn't go all the way to Arizona where I think the closest one is.
2355549	2357991	I wouldn't go all the way to Arizona just to go to Waffle House.
2358311	2363817	But it's one of those things where it's like, eh, if I'm on a trip and it's late and it's like, yeah, let's get the experience.
2363857	2364177	Let's do it.
2364197	2365619	That's what it was in Atlanta.
2365699	2368522	I think it was the first time I had it, it was really late at DragonCon.
2368542	2369382	It was like, you know what?
2370343	2371525	Let's get the Waffle House thing.
2371585	2375649	Oh no, I had gone to Waffle House the first time in Tucson, actually, when I was visiting friends.
2376469	2381134	I guarantee you if I go to Dragon Con, we're eating at Waffle House every fucking day.
2382135	2388321	There's two within walking distance of Dragon Con, so it's not... One of them is super crowded, the other one is super not.
2389670	2389970	DragonCon 2025
2408426	2431376	um but I will be there uh as a what they call a um attending professional um basically because of you know all the work that I've been able to do for OLR and stuff over the years and my horror hosting comes into that as well um so I'm really excited to be back at DragonCon this year and you know whatever they they asked me to do I'll do it with bells on so well I have a quote from my mother what's that about why she will not live out here
2433051	2434452	for many reasons, but the big reason.
2434612	2435452	They don't have a Waffle House.
2435532	2438833	And I quote, I ain't living nowhere that don't got a Waffle House.
2441173	2441534	The end.
2442314	2445195	Bonds006 says, Rob needs some New York City hangover pizza.
2445375	2446415	Oh, been there, done that.
2447195	2448355	I love New York City pizza.
2448636	2449096	I love it.
2449516	2449876	Love it.
2450683	2451623	New York City Pizza is bomb.
2451704	2454065	The best Sbarro's I ever went to was the one in Times Square.
2454085	2456046	It was also the cheapest food there.
2456506	2459908	I'm talking the place on the fucking corner from my friend's house.
2460108	2461028	I don't know the fucking name.
2461068	2462309	It's just the corner pizza store.
2462669	2465170	That's, yeah.
2465650	2466151	That's great.
2466371	2467191	But here's the thing.
2467952	2470293	And people are going to say, well, what do you prefer, Rob?
2470313	2472214	New York City Pizza or Chicago Pizza?
2472314	2473374	And I'm going to say stop.
2474135	2475615	Not everything has to be a fight.
2476096	2477857	Both are good.
2477877	2478577	Exactly.
2478977	2480778	I will happily eat both.
2481818	2483479	And you can also throw in Detroit Style.
2483719	2484400	I mean, there's that.
2484740	2485480	Oh, God, yes.
2486180	2490382	Saburo, I went there because it was the only thing that was in my budget.
2491183	2495425	And it was actually the best I had ever been to anywhere in the country.
2496649	2500535	But I would also say there is a difference.
2500735	2502659	Chicago pizza is a meal.
2503500	2507146	New York pizza is a extra meal.
2507206	2509730	I don't want to say a snack, but New York pizza is a...
2511653	2512193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2532219	2534461	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2534481	2534701	I was busy
2559620	2562463	Dragon Age The Veil Guard Dragon Age The Veil Guard Dragon Age The Veil Guard
2583106	2584527	because I own the cartridge.
2584627	2585427	I own two systems.
2585707	2586748	I'm legally allowed to do it.
2587288	2587948	Couldn't get it to work.
2588188	2589169	And I love fucking GORF.
2589389	2590029	So this is mad.
2591690	2599453	So for PC Engine, I played Summer Carnival 92 Alzadik, which is like a two-minute score attack kind of thing.
2599553	2602214	It was one of the Summer Carnival games, and I wanted to give it a try.
2602254	2603194	It's like RECA.
2605115	2609677	I played R-Type CD, and I remembered why I don't like R-Type CD, because I hate the music.
2611058	2612553	and I played some Devil's Crush
2613911	2640632	and then I played some Super Fantasy Zone on the Genesis Mega Drive and I played Atari 7800 Dig Dug and I started on WonderSwan Color I started Digimon Adventure Zero 2 D1 Tamers which honestly is a lot more fun than Pokemon games I'm just gonna be up there with that right now not more exciting and that and I freaking love early Digimon stuff so but yeah that's what I played nice
2641854	2642935	All right, Loki, how about you?
2642995	2643616	How was your gaming week?
2644957	2646618	It was just basically Minecraft.
2646718	2655346	So it was still doing some more tweaks to my theme park for the end of season tours, just kind of finishing up that stuff.
2655366	2659590	I actually gave a tour to one of our server mates on Thursday.
2659610	2663153	We did a live stream, or she did a live stream, and did all that.
2663293	2664134	So that was fun.
2664174	2666016	Did I see that your video was getting more views?
2666036	2667257	Like it was up to like a thousand views?
2668372	2670153	Yeah, it's up to almost 1,400 now.
2670394	2671634	They've stopped pushing it, though.
2671654	2672875	It's flattened out.
2673776	2674336	That's still a bummer.
2674356	2675797	You know, that's not bad.
2675997	2677958	Yeah, better than 50 views.
2678259	2679880	Yeah, like, yeah, certainly.
2680520	2681381	So that's good.
2682441	2685003	But don't judge your self-worth on the view count.
2685503	2686364	It's an amazing video.
2686404	2688085	Listen to everybody telling you it's an amazing video.
2688105	2688325	It is.
2689426	2690446	Yeah.
2690867	2691247	Thank you.
2691987	2695370	Yeah, and then Bellaltro played more of that, of course.
2696770	2696831	Um...
2697768	2698609	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
2699009	2699250	Great.
2700250	2704375	My gaming week was a little abbreviated because of my trip, so I can't really say I played a lot.
2704775	2710080	I did buy Hello Kitty Island Adventure because I thought I would play it on the plane, but I ended up napping.
2710601	2711561	Yes, I can nap on planes.
2712282	2715305	So I'll probably play that this week because, yeah, I had to buy it.
2715325	2716246	It was only 40 bucks.
2716306	2716907	I was like, what?
2717307	2739184	I want to play it so look forward to that next week otherwise I got the classics working on my Steam Deck so I've been just randomly doing that I've been playing Super Mario Kart like the original original just you know working on my achievements my retro achievements for older games so I started Super Mario Kart because that's the game I wanted to play that's it
2741565	2743245	I was going to ask if you traveled with the Steam Deck.
2743386	2743906	I didn't.
2744006	2747887	I traveled with the Switch, but I just felt like the Steam Deck was too much.
2748008	2755711	For some reason, I felt the Switch was a little bit better, but then I didn't play it once just because I was busy doing tourist stuff.
2755811	2760113	So it's probably for the best I wasn't in a hotel room playing my video games all day.
2760133	2762854	I was out walking and seeing the city in between the rain.
2764546	2768068	Um, but, uh, also Diablo 4, no surprise there.
2768108	2771611	Y'all know I fucking love that game and been going still on season seven.
2771651	2775393	And I'm up to Torment 2 on my Barbarian that I've been playing.
2775433	2783078	And Diablo 7 is getting like a little mini event for, it's kind of a belated Lunar New Year event because it doesn't start till Tuesday.
2783118	2786640	And I think Lunar New Year was last week, but fine.
2786960	2788421	Uh, it's, it's going to be here.
2788441	2793304	And I think they're doing a bit of a bug fix patch and kind of balancing some of the things of the season.
2793324	2793364	Um,
2793784	2795165	Diablo 4 Diablo 3 Diablo 4 Diablo 4 Diablo 3
2816152	2841688	maybe not next week but in two weeks we're gonna have Civ 7 is gonna hit that's a big deal for me and then also I believe Avowed hits in that same time frame I think Avowed is February 13th if I remember right so those are two big heavy hitters at least the type of games that are my jam in the same week so February's got some big stuff on the horizon so that'll be exciting alright
2842674	2852551	Well, since that's it for our gaming week, let's move on to our next story, which I guess, I'm sorry, Loki, we did address that a little bit, but... No!
2852651	2853833	You took my story, Doc!
2853853	2854154	I'm sorry!
2855575	2858178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2877938	2878498	Maybe not a year.
2878518	2880139	I think it came out, was it October?
2880159	2882439	I don't remember if it was last year or not.
2882499	2884199	But essentially Forza Horizon 5.
2884279	2884759	It was 23.
2884799	2885179	It wasn't 2024.
2885219	2885179	23?
2885740	2886760	Okay, yeah.
2886940	2887780	So last October.
2887800	2888240	Maybe it was.
2888380	2889480	Was it all the way in 2022?
2890080	2890941	I think it was 2023.
2892241	2892761	I don't remember.
2892841	2895141	But yeah, it's been out for a while.
2895241	2897182	So essentially made its sales on Xbox.
2897682	2901643	Now Forza Horizon 5 is going to be coming to Sony's platform.
2902323	2902783	And it says...
2904932	2932744	well uh oh it says it was out four years ago wow it's been a while okay wow really yeah uh wow so yeah they're gonna be releasing the game uh it says uh I don't know what the date is on that but yeah they're Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 and then they're also I think it's gonna have all the unlocks kind of like a game of the year edition or something like that so that's gonna be pretty cool um
2934173	2942697	I mean, this is not going to be the last Xbox title on PlayStation and probably not on the Switch as well.
2942717	2946279	I mean, we're probably going to see stuff like that come to the Switch pretty soon.
2946399	2948620	So it makes sense.
2948880	2959105	I mean, essentially allowing folks to experience these games for the first time if they're on these platforms and not on the Xbox platforms.
2960586	2968212	It just makes sense to make more sales, especially on these older titles like this that could have some new life on new platforms.
2968992	2978319	I think the reason why some people don't want to believe it is because Forza Horizon is the title that some people will tell you is the reason to have an Xbox.
2978359	2987826	I know a lot of people associate Xbox with Halo and some of the other titles, but for many people, Forza Horizon is like, oh, if there's anything you need to play on Xbox that you can't play anywhere else,
2988587	2989467	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3014273	3016054	Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass Game Pass
3045274	3047115	Am I not still a Nintendo fan?
3047195	3051158	You know, because I want to play the game, you know, and I can play it on a different platform.
3051198	3054460	Like, I would still be a fan of whatever that is.
3054540	3056522	It doesn't matter if it's coming out on other platforms.
3056562	3058043	You're a fan of the content.
3058283	3069270	That'd be like saying, you know, like, I'm a fan of the VCR they play all these movies on, but not necessarily the movies that are in the VCR or the DVD player, Blu-ray player, whatever the case may be.
3069770	3070191	But, like...
3070931	3098944	specifically I'm just a fan of the actual hardware like it's silly it's a silly argument to make you're a fan of the different franchises and IP that these different companies have and the fact that they're putting them out on multiple platforms out there like it shouldn't matter what it's on like just play it where you can play it on the same note though imagine it's a toaster and you have a toaster that's got better qualities that you like on it even if the toast isn't always the best
3101780	3104041	Can it make the Texas toast just right?
3106923	3108504	I want that steam toaster, by the way.
3108564	3109645	But anyway, that's a different story.
3109705	3120513	But I'm just saying that I see how people are like, well, I prefer the way that this one is operated and the way this one is set up.
3120673	3124155	Because, I mean, they are two similar technologies done differently.
3124255	3126757	And I can see someone being a fan of the tech.
3127498	3129419	But in the end, is the game fun?
3133427	3133947	Is the game fun?
3134007	3134448	That's right.
3134548	3135208	Is the game fun?
3135369	3138812	Because look at, I mean, again, look at a lot of these games I was mentioning at the top of the show.
3140173	3143896	Vampire Survivors, Stardew Valley, hell, Minecraft.
3144417	3144977	None of these games.
3144997	3147419	I prefer a PlayStation controller to an Xbox controller.
3147499	3148280	Have cutting edge graphics.
3148340	3149561	I do love a PlayStation controller.
3150422	3153703	Although the new Xbox controller is actually really damn good.
3157384	3167927	I maybe give PlayStation a slight edge, but I will say the PlayStation controller kind of wears on my hands after playing it for a long time, and the Xbox one doesn't.
3167987	3169627	I will give it to Xbox in that department.
3170308	3172768	I get more mileage out of the Xbox controller in one session.
3172788	3174049	Give me a Saturn analog controller.
3174129	3174549	I'm happy.
3176709	3177970	Give me a GameCube controller.
3178010	3178530	Never better.
3179435	3180156	Creeper Toaster
3191998	3193598	That was just a regular toaster.
3193878	3195699	It did make creeper faces on it.
3196259	3198099	It just was a regular damn toaster.
3198439	3202360	Next to it, though, they had an Xbox toaster that made the Xbox logo on the toast.
3202620	3203840	That's how it's supposed to work.
3203940	3206641	I don't want a branded toaster that's just a regular toaster.
3207121	3208141	What's the point?
3208501	3215943	They both make toast, but the technology of the Xbox toaster had more features that you wanted.
3215963	3216063	Right.
3217242	3244720	and I used to have a Hello Kitty toaster so my analogy stands I had a Hello Kitty toaster that would put Hello Kitty's face on every piece of toast I mean I want a toaster that I can program to put whatever I want on it and it's just going to be a butt I'm sure those probably exist to be quite honest they do the thing with the Hello Kitty toaster is that it never looked like it did on the box it was like just like a giant circle in the middle of the toast expressionless just like Hello Kitty that's the only thing it had in common
3246267	3252473	Hello Kitty is the first mascot of dissociative disorder.
3253474	3260461	You have to have some sort of laser etched toaster thing in order for that custom print thing to work.
3260481	3262363	You think some nerd has to figure that out?
3262523	3264065	The CNC toaster.
3265824	3293809	Bobby Blackwolf says I have an Xbox fridge that isn't a fridge but rather a cooler oh yeah there's that whole that's right there's the whole Xbox branded full-size fridge that was being offered for a while well that that little you're oh yeah there was the big there was a big big one right but the one that is like the same size is it like it's a cooler for like two cans of soda and it's it's seriously just a novelty item it's it's it's not something to ever take seriously that's for sure
3295363	3296364	I've seen the Creeper fridge.
3296384	3298484	There's so many of those fridges.
3299525	3300105	But why?
3301205	3306407	I would never buy one because I'm literally just... I could almost touch my actual fridge right here.
3308248	3308908	Yeah, I don't know.
3310769	3312209	It's a neat novelty thing, I guess.
3313570	3315731	What I need is none of that crap.
3317431	3317992	Thank you, Hecht.
3318392	3319092	I don't need any of it.
3320305	3320985	Pizza warmer?
3321646	3325428	Pizza's never gonna get cold when I'm around pizza, so it's fine.
3325608	3327489	Cold pizza is life.
3330010	3331871	One minute in the microwave is sufficient.
3332712	3334273	I don't need anything fancier than that.
3335113	3336354	You put it in the air fryer.
3336454	3338235	I mean, we do have an air fryer.
3338255	3338855	I guess I could.
3338915	3344278	No, you open the fridge in the Tupperware container and eat it right out of the Tupperware container.
3345699	3345719	I...
3349273	3354135	Yeah, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, this really is that OLR Foodio episode from the Channel Point reward.
3354155	3362897	Yeah, that show we owe the listeners we never did because Rob unfortunately got a pretty bad medical diagnosis and didn't want to talk about food for a while when that all happened.
3363998	3366239	I guess it's paying off tonight finally.
3366679	3366979	All right.
3367519	3370520	Anyway, but moving on, we do have other video game news to talk about.
3370600	3374761	And that is, of course, God, you knew this was going to fucking happen.
3375081	3376342	You knew this was going to happen.
3377302	3379764	and it's this whole Nintendo Switch 2 experience.
3379945	3381426	I don't know anybody that got in.
3382107	3385890	Everybody that I am friends with on Blue Sky said, I didn't get it, I didn't get it.
3385990	3388672	So I don't know who got it, but it isn't anybody I know.
3388733	3390234	Maybe somebody in chat got in.
3390294	3392656	Let me know if you got tickets to the Nintendo Switch 2 experience.
3392936	3394818	But you know who did get in?
3395959	3396520	Scalpers.
3397799	3398320	That's right.
3398480	3402186	Tickets for the experience are being listed on eBay.
3403107	3407214	So, of course, now that confirmation is coming in, people are posting on eBay about it.
3408095	3408476	Let's see.
3408636	3409758	A ticket from Milan.
3411060	3413023	I thought that stuff was non-transferable.
3413223	3418505	Well, a ticket from Milan is currently available for a buy it now price of 300 euros.
3419205	3426828	But a lot of listings are getting removed and probably because Nintendo came out and said these tickets are non-transferable.
3427268	3430370	So perhaps an eBay sale is not going to actually result.
3430490	3430730	I mean, I...
3431810	3434091	It depends on how harshly they're screening this.
3434271	3440595	If they're going to actually check IDs and the ID has to match the ticket, then yeah, that's going to be a hard thing to pull off.
3440655	3446798	But if it's just scanning a barcode, it would be very easy to send the screenshot from a cell phone to somebody else.
3447839	3451761	So it depends on how strict they're going to be with checking it.
3452641	3456363	And if they fully check IDs, that should cause the whole thing to run slower.
3457004	3457864	So I don't know.
3458384	3458604	But...
3459724	3460204	DarkSakura
3483909	3489491	Well, there is some trademarking going on in Sega.
3489851	3490291	In Sega.
3490852	3491392	In Japan.
3491652	3491912	Oops.
3492352	3493152	The land of Sega.
3494073	3500935	There are trademarks for Skies of Arcadia and Eternal Arcadia on January 16th in Japan.
3500975	3502376	It's now public as of January 24th.
3504296	3508697	which was a turn-based RPG that came out for Dreamcast in 2000.
3509378	3513659	And there was an enhanced GameCube version called Skies of Arcadia Legends.
3513899	3515019	This is not my classic game of the week.
3515039	3515479	I'm going to do it.
3515599	3516499	I'll do it some other time.
3517560	3520881	But yeah, it looks like...
3522518	3525600	We may be seeing a re-release of it, so who knows.
3526401	3530443	And I will read the splash for the original.
3531224	3532324	The sky's the limit.
3533085	3540129	Follow the adventures of Vice as he journeys through uncharted skies to discover new continents and explore mystical ruins.
3540650	3548975	Accompanied by Aika and Fina, he will wage epic battles against savage monsters, evil pirates, and a powerful enemy nation.
3550538	3551039	It was cool.
3552419	3554380	Dan's friend Eric was way into that.
3555320	3557441	I liked the Japanese name better, Eternal Arcadia.
3557501	3558221	I think it was better.
3558602	3561483	But it was a pretty neat game.
3561543	3562783	It was a good game for Dreamcast.
3562803	3566365	I don't know, maybe they'll do an HD remake?
3566505	3566885	Who knows?
3567665	3568886	Question mark in Terabang.
3569468	3596026	yeah between this and like you know all the rumors surrounding you know Crazy Taxi and some of the other reboots that Sega's digging up it seems like Sega could really be a huge publisher on the Switch too I would imagine is what they're really targeting for a lot of this although refer back to earlier in the show maybe they have some type of partnership with Nintendo but I would be hard-pressed to believe anything they put out wouldn't also come out on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, all of it try to try to sell more copies
3597017	3602008	Sega's heading back into their retro days, and yeah.
3602574	3631854	yeah which great honestly well it probably it probably costs less it's less of a gamble you know going back again to some of this talk at the top of the show it's probably less development cost to reboot some retro titles you know I'm not saying they're cheap you got to pay some people to you know not just you know do the remastering but you know potentially all new work on a game like Crazy Taxi Battle Royale if that's to be believed um but it's probably a lot cheaper to make something like that than it is to make a Final Fantasy 16 you know
3634347	3635414	Alright, well moving on.
3635495	3635716	Loki.
3637498	3648343	Alright, well, so the Sony is going to be, once again, pulling back things that they're giving out on PlayStation Plus.
3649123	3653425	And one of the things that we used to get was monthly PlayStation 4 games.
3653765	3657046	And now, they are no longer going to be including those.
3658447	3664230	The paid subscription service will offer them occasionally, but the main focus will be on PlayStation 5 games.
3665370	3668773	because obviously they want you to be playing on PlayStation 5.
3669274	3677541	However, you will still get the benefit if you get games that are multi-platform in the sense that they are PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5.
3677921	3691993	So those, for example, in February, we have High on Life, which is on both, so you do get both versions of that, and Pac-Man World Repack on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, and then Payday 3 on PlayStation 5.
3693188	3694148	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3712634	3716255	Now, granted, it wasn't easy to get for about three of those years, but...
3730390	3742709	I don't even remember when they got my Playstation 4 A while, it's been a while 2014 was when that was released If I'm not mistaken, yeah Okay, yeah, probably time then So we had a good run Yeah
3744880	3752445	Also, Sony is backing off on PlayStation login requirements for the PC version of Spider-Man 2.
3754167	3768696	So also, they said that they're done forcing PlayStation Network accounts for single-player games, including God of War Ragnarok, Horizon Zero Dawn, Remastered, and the upcoming Last of Us 2 Remastered port, as well as Spider-Man 2.
3769317	3772379	Not to mention Spider-Man 2, I believe, or...
3772819	3774220	What was it just that we released on PC?
3776160	3777501	Was that the original Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2?
3777681	3778121	I don't remember.
3778661	3780422	Either way, that one's fucked up right now.
3780702	3784663	It is buggy as hell and needs batches to fix it.
3784723	3793326	But yeah, good to see they're kind of getting rid of that requirement because it does kind of block them from selling more copies of it.
3793406	3794607	Really, what is the point?
3795563	3796143	for doing that.
3796223	3798304	Why need a PlayStation Network account?
3799485	3803247	Is the thought that, oh, if they create a PSN account, then they'll buy a PlayStation.
3803407	3804808	No, that's not how that works.
3805248	3805909	It's just annoying.
3805929	3808470	It's another login that no one wants to use anyways.
3809871	3810191	I don't know.
3813192	3816054	They'll allow you to do it if you want to, but it's optional now.
3817655	3831609	you know going back to the Forza coming out on PlayStation thing though you know you're gonna have to almost certainly log into Xbox account on your PlayStation like you do with Minecraft to play it so
3834054	3836676	I guess I'm buying an Xbox then.
3836776	3839259	PC's kind of a different beast.
3840080	3845966	And I get the rules are a little different when it comes to PC and what the PC gaming fans won't let you get away with.
3846787	3852513	Well, because a lot of PC players play on a Windows platform, which you're already signed into Microsoft at that point.
3852653	3852833	Yes.
3853114	3854956	So it's not really a big deal.
3854976	3855296	Yeah.
3856479	3858201	All right, well, what is a big deal for me?
3858342	3865051	And I was out of town all weekend, so I haven't gotten to experience this yet, but No Man's Sky got another update.
3865111	3865772	That's right.
3866012	3867674	How many updates does that make for this game now?
3867835	3868215	A lot.
3868535	3869136	Too many.
3870158	3872962	I don't know if I'd say too many, but it is a lot.
3873362	3879586	Well, anyway, so we had an update last year called Worlds Part 1, so we knew there was going to be a Part 2 eventually, and here it is.
3879626	3880607	We got Worlds Part 2.
3881608	3891474	And they're saying that a lot of this was inspired by the work being done on Light No Fire, which as we know is Hello Games' next project, which they've been a little bit tight-lipped on.
3891555	3899160	And obviously, if you know Hello Games' history, you completely understand why they're not really saying a lot of shit about Light No Fire, and they're probably just going to release it.
3899580	3900621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3924261	3929709	They are making terrain more detailed and varied, bigger mountains, better features.
3930269	3935336	Oceans can be several kilometers deep, which actually like kind of freaks me out.
3935477	3936218	I don't know what it is.
3936498	3938881	I do not like the underwater elements.
3939582	3940303	in these games.
3940763	3943285	You know what game I will not fucking play?
3943525	3944646	I will not fucking play it.
3944766	3945347	Subnautica.
3945747	3946688	I will not play that game.
3946708	3947949	I don't know.
3948009	3951652	I guess I have some weird fear about deep underwater stuff.
3951812	3953874	Maybe it's like a claustrophobia adjacent thing.
3954214	3957637	But even in No Man's Sky, it kind of creeps me out.
3958797	3970365	I don't like the underwater stuff, but I guess there is a vehicle that lets you... I've used a vehicle that seems to make it a little more tolerable, but even then it's like I get lost in the caves so easily.
3970865	3977410	Getting lost on the ocean floor sounds really scary, but it's a thing and some people will be into it, just not me.
3977470	3979091	There's other features in the game I can enjoy.
3979611	3984193	Such as a new lighting system that lets water reflect the clouds and other objects.
3984213	3985793	The water already looked amazing in that game.
3986533	3988634	Creatures make more convincing ripples.
3988794	3991135	So it's basically tweaking the graphics, making it better.
3992736	3997837	Apparently, creatures will now lurk deeper beneath the sea than ever before in the new game.
3998618	4004620	Also, there's apparently going to be new types of planets because they're actually adding a whole... So if you play the game...
4005751	4008893	You have to, to unlock different types of solar systems.
4009293	4011275	You have to unlock the red drive.
4011575	4012796	You have to unlock the green drive.
4012836	4016658	I think they call it cadmium drive, but it's a red, blue, and green drives.
4016979	4021341	They are now adding a purple drive to visit purple solar systems.
4021762	4025344	So my understanding is they have now added to the generation.
4025384	4029187	They've added these purple solar systems that have new types of planets in them.
4029227	4033089	So it's like a whole, and that's probably the biggest part of it is that now there's whole new stuff.
4033429	4033810	That's right.
4033910	4035291	Purple planet is now available.
4036251	4039554	And so that's going to mean more tweaks to the game to support that.
4039914	4043137	New quest line, new expeditions that will show off these planets.
4043757	4046880	And of course, new Twitch drops to support all of that.
4047240	4054285	Unfortunately, I usually try to stream to help people get those drops, but it unfortunately was very poorly timed on my trip this weekend.
4054325	4057128	So I haven't... This is the one...
4057868	4059590	No, I think there was one other Twitch campaign.
4059970	4061791	I just haven't been able to watch to get the drops.
4061891	4064153	And that sucks because it's a good way to catch up.
4064814	4069958	If you haven't played all of the expeditions, you can kind of still get a good chunk of the rewards through these Twitch campaigns.
4070458	4071499	But it is what it is.
4072200	4076263	And Questmaster says, yeah, the purple drive is part of the new story that came with the patch.
4076543	4077964	The game still looks amazing.
4078144	4086031	And I think probably on a PlayStation 5 Pro, especially, or a high-end PC or, you know, whatever can play this, like, it's going to look
4086451	4087071	Fuckin' incredible.
4087331	4089452	Some of the streams I've been watching, the game still looks amazing.
4090393	4091793	It's such a good looking game.
4092013	4094034	I'm really glad the page has turned on this game.
4094074	4096295	We're now on Steam all these years later.
4096756	4098336	The reviews are mostly positive.
4100277	4109461	It's been a long time coming, but it's not a lot of games that consistently improve over... How long has that game been out now?
4109941	4110462	Eight years?
4111122	4112122	Nine years, maybe?
4112963	4113463	It's wild.
4114892	4120255	Yeah, QuestBuster says it's almost overwhelming at this point what you can do in No Man's Sky in a good way.
4120355	4120915	Yeah, I agree.
4120955	4121896	Y'all know I love that game.
4122516	4130841	I haven't really gone on a binge of No Man's Sky in a bit, but I think I'm due for another new game playthrough so I can visit the purple planets.
4133191	4134533	Maybe soon, maybe soon, we'll see.
4134713	4137476	It's been hard for me to stream lately, but we'll see, we'll see.
4138237	4140640	Anyway, oh, Jamie, this next story.
4140881	4145827	I thought of you instantly when I read this story, but this is, I've seen a lot of people talk about this.
4148220	4150984	Oh yeah, I don't know how I feel.
4151825	4158374	So Sims and Sims 2 are being re-released on PC for the 25th anniversary.
4158995	4163041	Nothing about Mac or anything else right now.
4165483	4186210	but you can buy them separately with the expansion packs included 20 for the original and 30 for The Sims 2 you can get a birthday bundle that has everything for 40 on Steam and Epic Games and the EA app EA Play Pro can get it
4187390	4187830	Unlimited.
4189271	4191652	But, you know, like I said, nothing about consoles or Mac.
4192392	4204137	They're saying that they might be available... Well, there was the rumor that they might be available after there was a teaser video that had some of the user interface there.
4204157	4205117	But...
4208891	4219430	Yeah, I mean, Maxis was talking about wanting to make the re-releases more compatible for Windows 10 and 11, but we didn't really have anything on it, so now we do.
4219938	4232426	My assumption was that this is directly tied to the news last week that Origin was going away because we talked about how, you know, the Sims kind of being older games might not run as well on the 64-bit and all that.
4232446	4236509	So I assumed that this was directly tied to Origin goes away.
4236549	4241432	But here's a way to continue playing our biggest franchise of all time.
4241492	4244234	If I'm not mistaken, wouldn't the Sims be EA's biggest franchise of all time?
4244274	4244734	It's got to be.
4244774	4246775	Well, maybe not next to sports.
4246955	4247876	Maybe not next to sports.
4248476	4249057	It's hard to say.
4249777	4277931	but we'll say one of one of yeah but I mean I don't know because I mean I had a lot of fun on Sims 2 I really liked Sims 3 Sims 4 is okay you know but I mean it's hard to go back and play those old ones unless they've like updated something but yeah I have a hard time going back and playing them
4278342	4279924	That's how I feel about Diablo.
4303886	4318327	all my old mods actually still on my old PC that I'm actually tempted to yank out the hard drive and put it in an enclosure just to see what I can get off of it but I wonder if my old naughty mods would work
4319638	4335951	But I still think in both cases for Sims and Diablo, I think it's a great thing for game preservation and for people that want to see what those games are like and understand how when we talk about the quality of life, things that change, like really having an understanding of what's different and the lore, you know, in Diablo's case anyway.
4336772	4340255	I think most of the lore in the Sims is headcanon, but, you know, I guess...
4340897	4356120	it's not like what did the goths do now so but i always enjoyed the sims the original i don't know if i'd pay for the remake but i have a lot of friends on blue sky that have been posting like fuck yeah the sims is out downloading playing here's my house all that
4356923	4358964	Sims 4 itself is free.
4359044	4360985	Sims 3 is not.
4361025	4364226	But man, all the DLC for Sims 4.
4365006	4366747	But yeah, I found the birthday bundle.
4368188	4369648	It says it includes three games.
4371349	4377212	The Sims, Sims 2, Sims 4 Throwback Fit Kit, and Sims 4 Grunge Revival Kit.
4377492	4377652	What?
4378533	4391728	and also has all of the DLC so I'm seeing it all in there but yeah it's got content for Sims 4 in it as well so just looking at the Steam page
4393561	4395463	Maybe I'll have to visit the Sims again someday.
4395803	4398525	The game I would love to go back and revisit is SimCity.
4399426	4406712	And remember how Maxis torpedoed the SimCity reboot with all the online... Remember how it was just horrible timing with the always online?
4407933	4415019	The market was not ready for that type of model and people really flatly rejected SimCity when it came out.
4416500	4419122	That's still a concept I would love to visit again someday.
4420083	4421104	What the hell is this?
4421224	4422405	My Sims Kingdom?
4423720	4425922	Isn't that like a mobile?
4425942	4426422	Like a kids?
4428484	4433328	My Sims was like, it's a little chibi versions that they did on like the Wii.
4433348	4435710	I knew somebody that worked on.
4435790	4437471	It says coming March 18th.
4438252	4440454	So that's coming out on.
4440494	4446899	They just ported some of those over from the, I think the Wii, onto the Switch recently.
4446939	4448260	They had like a My Sims bundle.
4448820	4450382	Meh.
4450442	4450642	Meh.
4451355	4454837	It was kind of like Sims trying to be Animal Crossing is what it looked like.
4455958	4456318	Meh.
4457058	4462742	Well, on the gaming preservation front, some exciting news following up to something we were talking about last week, Loki.
4463689	4464390	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4464410	4465651	So this is pretty cool.
4465691	4474117	So the Video Game History Foundation has just launched a new free-to-use website that you can peruse old video game magazines.
4474197	4478061	They have over 1,500 magazines to choose from.
4479021	4482124	Everything from EGM, Game Informer, Game Pro.
4483385	4486607	Also, some other smaller publications as well.
4486647	4488429	Computer Game Review, Game...
4489147	4499713	Digital Diner, Girl Gamer Mega, Next Generation New Earth, Future Plays 3DO Club News Are you part of the 3DO Club?
4500834	4501614	Who isn't?
4502595	4503095	Who isn't?
4503575	4517283	And the official Sega Dreamcast Magazine Lots and lots of stuff to check out So that's pretty cool You can view that at library.gamehistory.org Pretty exciting
4518888	4521450	And you can actually, it's really easy to use.
4521550	4526694	You can just pull it up and it takes a little bit because I'm sure this website's getting slammed right now.
4527034	4529296	But I'm just doing like a little bit of a live demo here.
4529696	4535501	I just searched the archive for The Guardian Legend and I got a 1998 video game buyer's guide.
4535541	4536241	That can't be right.
4536501	4536862	You know what?
4537062	4538023	I have to put it in quotes.
4538123	4540344	That's the pro tip for me to you.
4540665	4542146	Put what you're searching for in quotes.
4543666	4546928	Otherwise, everything comes up that has both those search terms in it.
4547669	4551392	So, oh, I guess maybe it's just mentioned somewhere in there.
4551452	4552633	But let's go to, here we go, 1989.
4553053	4558877	This would be a little bit more closer to the time that that game was actually coming out.
4559378	4560939	And you can actually bring up the document.
4560959	4567224	And then the cool thing about it, the way they have it as a PDF, I guess they ran OCR or something because you can actually search for...
4567884	4593800	Guardian Legend and here we go here's when the Guardian Legend was mentioned in this buyer's guide saying here's an action space game that incorporates a number of the rapid fire features of your favorite coin op titles and increases the available options by opening up a number of new game ideas that turn a normal shooter into a galactic confrontation what a horrible description of a very multi-layered game that has nothing to do with coin op shooters
4595559	4621459	that's funny there it is, but then this also was cracking me up too, look at this, underneath this Bionic Commando, coming soon from Capcom, but look at the screenshot with a high score on it, this is the arcade version of Bionic Commando, not the NES version they sort of tried, I know, I know and they used to do that shit all the time back in the day hey, when you gotta rush to print, you do what you can get I know, I mean Jaleco Racket Attack, was Racket Attack the actual name of that game?
4621739	4624041	I thought they I thought they came out as something else
4625595	4627716	Ultima 3 Exodus Ease Master System
4651019	4651880	Oh my god, sorry.
4652240	4654042	Look, I fell down a rabbit hole.
4654062	4654402	Look at this.
4654943	4659326	Remember when Shanghai... You remember the game Shanghai?
4659967	4660988	Mahjong Solitaire?
4661208	4663470	You remember when that was on every fucking computer?
4663850	4665952	Specifically old black and white Macs.
4666432	4671196	That game was on every fucking computer in existence in the late 80s.
4671977	4674259	And then, of course, there was a Sega version as well.
4674419	4677061	Because every... Shanghai was like...
4677802	4680724	God, what is like a game that is on every fucking system?
4680764	4682725	They will put it on every fucking screen no matter what.
4683526	4684507	Shanghai was one of those.
4684787	4685767	You couldn't escape that game.
4686908	4690250	Anyway, good time down memory lane.
4690811	4692232	Thank you, Video Game History Foundation.
4692252	4696054	This is a really rad archive and I could probably lose many.
4696334	4697035	I mean, here's the thing.
4698316	4707302	If you think you could fall down a rabbit hole on Wikipedia late at night, just you wait for the insomnia this website's about to bring you.
4709833	4714717	Anyway, I guess maybe Tetris was on everything.
4716478	4718460	Some folks in chat saying Solitaire.
4719020	4719821	Solitaire is a good one.
4719841	4721062	Minesweeper, maybe.
4721122	4722763	But Minesweeper wasn't really on consoles.
4723404	4724645	So anyway.
4725045	4725825	All right, moving on.
4726446	4727447	Let's talk about this.
4727667	4729508	In some sad news that I...
4730669	4736114	I'll say it is unfortunately pretty unsurprising given the state of this particular company, Warner Brothers.
4737014	4741698	Multiverses is getting its multi-plug pulled.
4742479	4749345	Multiverses is ending the game on May 30th, meaning the online servers are no longer going to work after May 30th.
4750205	4752627	But you can play it offline if...
4753348	4764799	You downloaded and installed the latest version of the game, but you better download it after February 4th because the game itself is no longer going to be available to download on digital stores.
4765460	4771285	So you have this little interim period between February and May to download the game if you ever want to play it offline.
4772066	4774067	In the new season, you get new characters.
4774407	4779009	Aquaman and Lola Bunny are new characters that are available in the game.
4780229	4783591	And you can earn all this stuff through regular gameplay.
4784091	4787632	Real money transactions are no longer available for multiverses.
4788192	4793434	If you had Gleamium, which was the in-game currency, you can still use it until Season 5 ends.
4794995	4813849	and then as SSJ100Matt says in chat that's all folks for multiverses and it's sad because Warner Brothers what else do you expect the Netflix of video games
4816511	4818393	I tried to play multiverses for a little bit.
4818473	4820255	I mean, maybe I'm part of the problem.
4820355	4821476	It didn't really land for me.
4822297	4827663	One of my friends was really into it and tried to get me to play it, but I played it once or twice and I was like, eh.
4829079	4830520	Yeah, I am with Questbuster.
4830620	4836085	At least they're offering an offline option instead of disappearing into the void completely.
4836385	4838167	And Questbuster, I do agree with that.
4838607	4845834	It is interesting that it's this whole, you have to grab it in this very certain window in order for that to happen.
4846434	4847875	And my thought with that is...
4848476	4862186	Kudos to the developers because they must have seen the writing on the wall and they developed it this way so that it would have this ability to sunset in a more graceful way than what the alternative would have been.
4862967	4864468	So that's that.
4864948	4867831	SG-100 Matt reminds us too saying, I was into it during the beta
4868351	4897363	then it went away for a while so the the breaks did kind of get hit on this game and then it never really quite got that same speed back and I think that is also something to point out as to maybe why this game didn't didn't go all the way uh orange right in chat says I did try to get into multiverses a few months ago but couldn't get into the grinding I did go back to buy the powerpuff girls though so yeah Mike Def says a somewhat convoluted way to get the game offline but it is a way nonetheless yeah it is a way so all right
4898527	4927698	well speaking of games that have gone offline every week here on the show we visit some old games let's roll the bumper and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week
4928841	4932531	And DarkSakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week this week?
4934485	4938248	WakuWaku7 is a weird fighting game
4962626	4970788	It has a lot of stuff in common with the SNK fighters, like the four attacks and the zooming on the screen and everything.
4971388	4977709	You have nine characters, so two are available only in versus mode on console ports.
4978389	4981109	And they have different play styles, and they're all basically parodies.
4981169	4982130	All the characters are parodies.
4982230	4989131	WakuWaku, for the record, is a Japanese onomatopoeia for excitement.
4989951	4990512	Waku Waku!
4990572	4991552	You know, you're really excited.
4993734	4999938	And so there's like, but going back to the characters, there's like some charge moves, there's lots of talking in the game.
5000639	5010886	Some pose, like different things and having unblockables and hard to dodge attacks and then other, it's a crazy ass game.
5012647	5017410	So I will read the plot from the system itself.
5018291	5024238	It is said that the person who collects all seven of the legendary Waku Waku balls will have their dearest wish granted.
5024679	5029044	Those who find one of the balls become obsessed with the ruthless desire to obtain the others.
5029604	5033869	Who will be victorious in the bitter battle to become the owner of all the balls?
5034530	5036572	Victory or defeat, it all lies in your hands.
5036652	5038014	There's your Dragon Ball parody right there.
5039594	5041195	So, your characters.
5041215	5043417	I'm going to go through the characters because it's funny.
5044038	5052705	So, your main character, well, I guess, Rai Bakul is a 13-year-old who wants to go on exciting adventures.
5052805	5058690	He is a BMX fan, and he is a parody of Si Ken So from King of Fighters and Psycho Soldiers.
5060072	5063075	Irina Makihara is a girl with bunny ears.
5064837	5070622	She's a parody of the half-human anime girls.
5071684	5094713	Dan DJ is our treasure hunter and he is actually a parody of Indiana Jones and Joseph Joestar from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure he's very muscular he is followed by his friend's daughter Natsumi and her cat Rampu who's sometimes called Ramp or Rump um
5095793	5124634	you have Maru known in Japanese as Marurun it's a forest creature that's a parody of Totoro and he has a little lost girl named Mugi he's very similar to Sasquatch in Darkstalkers Palatank Z is a tank mecha policeman who is a parody of the police tanks from Dominion Tank Police it's old anime manga actually one of my favorites, it's really fun
5125635	5139370	and he is piloted by the chief and his sidekick the mechanic who is a dog he's a large slow one you have Slash is this elf with light green hair and a blue trench coat he uses a laser sword um
5140311	5141972	He doesn't really have a wish.
5142533	5144494	He's just there to remove a curse.
5145254	5146915	And he's just like a sword guy, you know?
5147616	5153500	And then there's Tess, which is a robot built by Dr. Lombroso.
5154000	5159663	And she was meant to be a maid, and she wants to be human.
5160584	5166388	And she is sort of like a parody of Astro Boy and cosplay restaurants.
5169693	5172277	This is a Sunsoft game, not an SNK game.
5173158	5173339	Mike.
5176269	5177951	although it did come out for Neo Geo.
5180693	5192484	Your versus mode characters from the home versions is Bonus-kun, who has moves that kind of make fun of you from Street Fighter.
5193686	5200972	He actually is a character from Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors, and he was Rolly's punching bag until he became alive.
5202954	5227694	because he doesn't have limbs he can't crouch or grab he's a punching bag a living punching bag and then there's a character named Makai Taitei Fernandez also called Fernandeth in the Japanese version who is the emperor of the demon world he is a sphere with stubby arms, legs and wings and a huge grin and a really annoying voice
5229089	5231410	He is the game's final boss.
5231450	5232971	He's tall as a skyscraper.
5235612	5238453	And yeah, magic is how you fight him.
5238493	5240854	And he's actually a reference to being Kaiju.
5241775	5245937	So it was Sunsoft's third fighting game.
5246217	5250479	It came after the Sugoi Heberica, which is part of their Heberica series.
5252219	5257422	And 1995 Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors, which was their first 2D fighting game.
5258722	5281650	um the number in this has to do with the playable characters in the roster the seven um and not anything having to do with any sequential uh things and as I said WakuWaku is an onomatopoeia for sounds of excitement and then um after that though Sunsoft worked with a company called Santa Claus um
5282290	5310718	all one word, all cap letters and doing a game in 1998 which is an airborne fighting game called Astra Superstars for the Sega ST5 arcade system this was later ported to Neo Geo AES home consoles had difficulty settings and credits and whatnot there was a Neo Geo CD version planned but it was cancelled because the Neo Geo CD was not doing that well
5311338	5317860	It did get ported to the Sega Saturn in Japan, and it requires the 1MB RAM expansion cartridge.
5319220	5331763	In 2008, the Neo Geo version was included with the Neo Geo CD version of Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors in Volume 11 of the Neo Geo Online Collection Series for PS2 titled Sunsoft Collection.
5334103	5360271	and the soundtrack for Galaxy Fight Universal Warriors was added in there but the soundtrack for WakuWaku 7 is different than the version that was going to be on the Neo Geo CD the version that was ported to Sega Saturn they said that they had licensing issues and that's why they couldn't do it the Neo Geo AES version was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on April 27, 2010
5362472	5371442	Also, the character Arina from WakuWaku7 made a cameo in Shanghai Musume Mahjong Girls in 2011.
5372103	5374525	So there's your... Remember, we were just talking about that, Rob.
5376347	5381113	The soundtrack for the Neo Geo version was released by Pony Canyon.
5382113	5387737	and Skytron label on August 21st, 1996 in Japan.
5389038	5397343	It had almost all the background music and sound effects and voice samples from the arcade version composed and arranged by Araikawa Masato.
5398884	5401487	This game was met with very positive reviews.
5401527	5407233	I mean, Famitsu, oh no, it's got a little middling for Famitsu, but Famitsu's notorious for being kind of stingy.
5409957	5415042	It was praised for its unique fighting system and character design, but it said the power gauge was...
5416765	5438519	the Saturn version was kind of mixed but it was a very straightforward conversion from the arcade version fans though freaking loved it this was voted for the Saturn port it was like a 7.5 out of 10 based on fights based on fans, sorry the Switch version has a 76.25% rating on game rankings and in 2021
5446258	5469911	uh it was rated as it was uh said to be sorry 2012 uh Complex Magazine was saying it's underrated and virtually unknown fighter and it's the 12th best this is the 12th best SNK fighting game it's it's by Sunsoft again and the the statement is Waku Waku 7 was a trip I was like yeah that's a pretty good
5470711	5495744	that's a pretty good one pretty good way to describe it instead that it gives you like all of the show and glitz of a Marvel vs. game so technically I guess you could translate this as to Exciting 7 but it is romanized as Waku Waku 7 just spelled out so there you go hmm
5496909	5498030	I didn't know a lot about this game.
5498050	5499070	It looks really cute.
5499430	5504954	I somehow missed this amongst all the fighting game types of its era, but this looks really cute.
5505174	5505794	Yeah, good pick.
5506314	5506895	It is a trip.
5507015	5509876	And again, it's on SNK Systems.
5510457	5511317	It's a Sunsoft game.
5511557	5512318	Yeah, yeah.
5512738	5516840	Which usually I associate Sunsoft with some of the NES classics like Blaster Master and stuff like that.
5516880	5520322	But yeah, obviously they put out some titles like this too.
5520442	5520642	Yeah.
5522836	5523056	Nice.
5524437	5533463	I also want to say that the Switch version, which was with the Arcade Archive Collection, was published by Hamster Corporation.
5534243	5534464	Yeah.
5535104	5538026	And the same port came out on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
5539347	5543009	Arcade Archives does a real good job with all those updates and things.
5543169	5543830	So, cool.
5545150	5547492	I just think it'd be funny if you worked for Hamster.
5548032	5548813	Like, hey, where do you work?
5549093	5549633	Hamster.
5549893	5550254	Ham.
5551134	5551454	All right.
5551655	5552055	Hamster.
5553629	5557531	Let's do some other headlines real quick from around the industry.
5558232	5562794	I just want to say real quick, because I saw this pop up while DarkSakura was doing that segment there.
5563154	5565895	I just want to state for the record, I don't give a shit about the Grammys.
5566456	5567796	I haven't for a very long time.
5567836	5570758	I think the whole thing is just bloated.
5571078	5572038	I don't care for it at all.
5572158	5577221	But Gaga just dropped a new song and video, so I need this show to be over so I can go listen.
5577341	5578422	I'm just kidding.
5578922	5579442	I'm just kidding.
5579462	5580042	I'm not rushing.
5580162	5580483	But...
5581553	5583735	That is what I will be doing immediately after the program.
5585737	5586058	All right.
5586958	5589181	Gotta have priorities.
5589421	5593425	Yeah, look, when Godga speaks, people listen.
5594566	5597029	All right, let's get to rapid fire news.
5597229	5598050	Loki, what do you have for us?
5599028	5612399	Alright, so we have the date for the next Summer Games Fest, which is going to be launching June 6th at 2pm Pacific Time, 5pm Eastern Time at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles.
5613259	5616001	And they're going to have it on lots of platforms to watch.
5616382	5618644	So, you know, that's a thing.
5618884	5627030	And then, of course, they're also going to do a physical event around that time produced by IM8Bit from June 7th through the 9th.
5628617	5655308	their play days which is going to be in downtown Los Angeles then we have a Capcom spotlight coming out this week on February 4th it's going to be a showcase talking about a bunch of different things from Onimusha, Street Fighter 6, Capcom Fighting Collection and Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics as well as a 15 minute showcase of Monster Hunter Wilds
5657369	5658290	Monster Hunter Wilds
5686264	5688747	It hit a little better than the other ones.
5688767	5690529	I don't know if it's for me.
5690989	5695674	I think it's going to need to be on like an Xbox Game Pass or something for me to finally get around to it, to be honest.
5696035	5700259	But the last one finally hit Game Pass eventually, so it'll happen.
5700640	5701040	It'll happen.
5702562	5702842	All right.
5703923	5704724	DarkSakura, what do you have?
5706093	5709095	So, one of my favorite series, Cotton.
5709255	5711396	There is a Cotton reboot, High Tension.
5711796	5715778	There's a trailer and details, and it's going to be out on July 24th in Japan.
5716398	5722801	I'm not a big fan of the art style compared to the old Cotton ones, but, you know, some things change.
5724182	5729885	So, you are playing Nata de Cotton, and she is back and still addicted to Willow.
5730947	5737461	Um, you have to still collect the Willis, but they are a little bit more sinister now, and they are making the fairies all...
5739199	5763441	in utter chaos so you have to go with cotton and silk and you have a new character named Macaron so yeah it's a cute-em-up shooter you have different magic you have an enemy capture system so you can use enemies to help you clear the stage and fever has been replaced by willow fever and you get an over-tension power so I think it's going to be really cool
5765441	5768343	Yeah, DarkTC in chat says, won't say no to more cotton.
5768584	5773188	Yeah, I mean... It says PS5, PS4, and Switch on July 24th.
5773208	5773288	Nice.
5776228	5778069	We have news for will be digital only.
5778109	5783231	Sorry, but the limited edition has a teacup, instruction card, booklet and soundtrack and CD.
5783451	5786793	I actually have the Cotton Saturn reboot one.
5787313	5789154	The cup was disappointing.
5789214	5795877	I thought I was going to get like one of her Japanese teacups, you know, it's just a mug and it's just Cotton reboot on it.
5797317	5798778	That's that's that's too bad.
5800321	5800581	All right.
5801042	5804504	Well, we have news of another video game becoming a TV show.
5804544	5815291	We've had quite a few of these, especially after the huge success of The Last of Us and The Witcher, which, yes, was a book, but probably the TV show has the video game more to thank, you know, and those types of things.
5816912	5817933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5841368	5846213	So Elliot Page played Jodie Holmes in the 2013 game when it was originally released.
5846774	5854242	I seem to remember there was controversy about a rendered nude model that they had not given.
5854282	5855102	It was a shadow scene.
5855183	5855543	Yeah.
5855643	5856504	A shower scene.
5856624	5858184	PageBoy Productions is the name of the production company.
5884391	5891195	has scooped up the TV adaptation rights from Quantic Dream, who originally published the game.
5891576	5897539	David Cage, who is behind the game and the writing and also directed the game, will also be collaborating on this.
5898059	5902062	Deadline is the ones reporting this, and that's one of the industry trades.
5902122	5903683	So this is legit information.
5903703	5905604	This isn't like a rumor.
5905664	5907105	Deadline is reporting on this.
5907685	5911347	And they say... Elliot actually owns the license.
5912128	5912288	Yeah.
5912308	5912388	Yeah.
5913499	5914280	Yeah, that's cool.
5914680	5927148	This adaptation will honor the game's legacy while inviting fresh perspectives, delving into questions of survival and how split-second decisions can alter not just our lives, but the lives of others are key to telling the story.
5927308	5929230	So this is going to be interesting.
5929290	5930911	I'm curious to see how this adapts.
5931231	5933693	So pretty neat little scoop.
5933733	5938956	And it's interesting, too, because this game is, you know, by video game standards, it's an old game at this point.
5939837	5941878	It qualifies as a classic game.
5942219	5942539	Yeah.
5943599	5944820	So it'd be interesting.
5945220	5950082	I'm really interested to see how they kind of modernize this for a different type of media.
5950122	5951782	But I think it has potential to be great.
5952482	5952863	But we'll see.
5954063	5957824	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some games coming out real soon.

6017000	6023085	Alright, moving over to Japan, we only have one major release this week, and that is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.
6023845	6028049	Looks to be a worldwide release because it is getting a release on the PlayStation 5 this week.
6028109	6031311	It is not, or I'm sorry, that is really the only major release.
6031331	6035134	There is nothing else coming out this week, and I'm not sure why that is.
6035174	6038056	I don't know if that's maybe because of Foundation Day, I think this is coming.
6038417	6040498	No, actually, that's in the next, it's on the 11th.
6041959	6045682	I'm not sure why this week is so slow, but it is what it is.
6046282	6047383	That's all you have in Japan this week.
6047563	6048604	How about the UK, DarkSakura?

6103927	6104327	Good times.
6105388	6106969	One more story for us tonight from Loki.
6108309	6114794	Yep, and then we've got news here talking about a writer coming back to Obsidian.
6116014	6123039	John Gonzalez has come back to work with Obsidian on another game.
6124073	6125834	Not Fallout New Vegas, unfortunately.
6126715	6131938	But they're going to be working on, I think, The Outer Wilds 2, it looks like.
6131958	6138521	It says... Yeah, it says, back to Obsidian for... He wrote this on his LinkedIn.
6138801	6140582	Back to Obsidian for exciting times.
6140682	6141803	No, it's not Fallout New Vegas 2.
6144249	6145950	I think that's funny.
6146010	6154617	Truly privileged to work with this incredibly kind and talented team but a new opportunity rose and I straight up couldn't resist.
6155237	6156298	So, awesome.
6158059	6158279	Yeah.
6158680	6160901	Curious to see what he works on.
6162202	6163383	What will it be?
6163583	6164224	We'll see.
6164244	6167386	Will it be Outer Worlds 2 or something?
6167726	6170088	Hopefully something with realistic sales expectations.
6170489	6171769	So, whatever it is.
6172510	6172810	Yeah.
6173311	6173671	Alright.
6174639	6180301	Well, this is the part of the show where we get into the listener roundtable, where we invite you all to participate with us.
6180961	6182002	You can always send us an email.
6182062	6185083	Participate at orangelaundry.com if you want to send us an email.
6185463	6190665	I don't think we had anything this week, but... It was something for you, and I forwarded it to you.
6190805	6191965	I did want to acknowledge that.
6192045	6194066	I did see that, and I just wanted to say thank you.
6194686	6198007	E3VL sent me a code for Pokemon, so thank you for that.
6198027	6198787	I do appreciate that.
6199988	6201768	But obviously, I'm not going to be reading that code on air.
6203909	6204390	But thank you.
6204730	6209834	And yes, even though I haven't been talking about it during my gaming week, I will say I have still been playing this shit.
6209874	6211335	I don't really talk about my mobile games.
6211835	6212656	I still play Ingress.
6212676	6215037	I still play Pikmin.
6215217	6216058	It's like the huge one.
6217659	6223964	I was carrying that Pikmin challenge this week, but to be fair, I was like, I got like 12,000 steps the other day in Portland and stuff.
6224004	6226526	So, you know, it comes with that.
6226926	6227546	But yeah.
6228667	6231670	I also am still playing Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket.
6232511	6237956	And that just had a big release because two new, the Palkia and Dialga, what are they fucking called?
6237976	6240919	Like Spacetime Continuum or something is the name of the packs, just came out.
6240959	6243321	So it's like all these new cards to get and grab.
6243421	6246244	So I appreciate the codes.
6246584	6248106	Yeah, I'm with Matt.
6248226	6251409	I've been playing the hell out of that game and I get really pissed off
6252455	6253797	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
6268769	6269289	Womp womp.
6269629	6269890	All right.
6270310	6274031	But we invite your emails, whether you want to give us redemption codes or otherwise.
6274171	6275292	We will take questions.
6275332	6276172	We will take hellos.
6276232	6278153	We will take a foodio if you really want.
6278493	6281054	Participate at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6281295	6282035	Yeah, E3VL.
6282055	6282835	That's what I try to do.
6282895	6285356	I try to open when I wake up and right before I go to bed.
6285696	6287877	And I think my time right now is 11 o'clock.
6288218	6291459	So as long as I do it in the morning and then right before bed, because I'm a night owl.
6291479	6292299	I don't go to bed till midnight.
6292740	6294020	I get my pack opens in.
6295481	6297682	So that's kind of how I've been working that system.
6299124	6305286	Alright, let's move on and check in with Loki for any last minute stories.
6306907	6307987	I don't have any.
6308667	6308887	What?
6310608	6328114	There was a story about a certain creator who we're not going to talk about who is now re-monetized on YouTube despite being an awful human being, but you know, that just seems appropriate in this year of 2025 and the world we live in now, so why not
6329244	6329684	why not?
6329985	6351340	I mean, yeah I just would rather give my views to people that deserve them on YouTube such as LokiOLR and his very intricate Minecraft builds that he's been working on I would much rather give my views there and oh yes, and my retro gaming and?
6352301	6353922	oh yeah, you're starting YouTube as well, right?
6354683	6355764	no, I've been on there
6357342	6365311	my shorts oh yeah you have your shorts on there that's right are you doing long form content there too?
6366512	6368534	I have some up there I'm working on some new ones
6370265	6372046	Doing your own video editing takes a while.
6372227	6372587	It does.
6372647	6373007	It does.
6373107	6378932	I'll tell you, the program I used to do it is the one that I'm the most comfortable with.
6378972	6385737	This is funny because it's a video editing program that is tailored toward learning and development training professionals.
6385797	6386777	It's called Camtasia.
6387518	6389339	And I've used this in my professional life.
6389479	6394583	And during Black Friday, I actually bought myself a personal license because I'm so comfortable in that video editor.
6394723	6396004	I can throw things together like that.
6396465	6397065	Like it's just...
6399241	6400201	read the manual read the manual
6427342	6444067	SSJ100Matt says best fast food shake, go I have to very much limit myself on these now I don't get to indulge in them as much as I used to but definitely the birthday cake shake was my favorite Loki, do you have a favorite shake?
6445407	6446227	a favorite shake?
6446527	6452789	yeah I would say like an orange creamsicle usually
6455494	6459561	Vanilla and Orange Sherbert mixed together Do you remember Orange Julius?
6460001	6461223	What the fuck ever happened to those?
6461303	6462045	Are they still around?
6462165	6463227	Can you still get Orange Julius?
6464213	6486265	no they they got bought up by Dairy Queen and Dairy Queen used to have them have Orange Julius at their locations and then they phased it out so it's exactly I I keep looking every once in a while because yeah there was one time that I actually got it at the local Dairy Queen here but then I went back and then they're like no we don't have that anymore I'm like
6488240	6493203	So if you go to their website, they have Orange Julius stuff and they list all of their locations to be able to get it at.
6493283	6494583	But no, that's not true.
6494904	6500306	I'm going to tell you the thing that gets getting acquired over and over again that we are lucky to still have.
6500426	6505609	And that is, and people in California will absolutely know this, Thrifty Ice Cream.
6506069	6509991	Thank God, after all these years, Thrifty Ice Cream has survived.
6510472	6515574	Well, yeah, Rite Aid bought Thrifty and thankfully kept the counters in a lot of locations.
6515795	6516695	And the neat scoop.
6516755	6517476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6533817	6552588	over in and out find a fucking thrifty ice cream counter at a Rite Aid and get the chocolate malt flavor in a cone it's so fucking good they still have one I think in Folsom because it does list thrifties ice cream outside but
6553249	6554810	Pocket has one.
6555511	6556492	Rosemont has one.
6557052	6558694	There's still a few of the areas.
6558714	6565901	There used to be one on Sunrise in Madison, but then it closed because now that got taken over by Walgreens.
6566121	6568924	Walgreens ended up buying Rite Aid.
6569124	6572607	I believe you can find thrifty ice cream at some Walgreens.
6573188	6599414	but I'm not sure and it's fine it's like that's the only way you can get thrifty ice cream is by buying it not from a counter but in a container at Walgreens then fine do it but if you can find a thrifty ice cream counter do it uh Hecht says we got a thrifty at the mall in Tucson so there's they're still around like but again you know thrifty was an old-ass drugstore then it was there was pay it was thrifty pay less right they merged
6600410	6603651	and then Rite Aid bought them both and then Walgreens bought Rite Aid.
6603911	6608854	And the question every single time has been, what's going to fucking happen to Thrifty Ice Cream?
6611735	6614896	But if I'm not mistaken, Thrifty Ice Cream is made in Mexico.
6614976	6615576	So guess what?
6616097	6616597	Guess what?
6617777	6618217	Guess what?
6621379	6622219	Meh.
6622519	6624060	25% price increase for no reason.
6627273	6631856	Anyway, Mike Deft in chat says thrifty ice cream is still a thing here.
6632156	6634818	I think last I heard it's made in Mexico.
6635098	6639060	So I could be wrong, but I thought that's where I heard it was being imported from.
6639280	6643043	So, oh, DJ Ranma S says Walgreens only bought some of Rite Aid.
6643083	6644083	I thought they bought the whole thing.
6645084	6647566	Yeah, Walgreens is not doing well anyways.
6648146	6648466	I mean.
6649047	6654250	Well, it turns out when you lock up all of your merchandise, people just say, fuck it, I'll buy it online.
6655410	6655911	How about that?
6658768	6660860	I found a knockoff ice cream scoop.
6661829	6665131	Oh, like a Throfty brand?
6665511	6669473	Thrifty apparently did, there was a release of the Thrifty official scoop.
6669993	6671333	They came out in 2019.
6671373	6672654	I found one on Amazon.
6672954	6673194	Oh, nice.
6673214	6674275	And I found some eBay ones.
6674555	6674795	Nice.
6675736	6677396	Yeah, the scoop is part of the charm.
6677716	6679877	It's just this very odd cylindrical shape.
6680158	6686140	But the thing about it is, when you get like a triple, it stacks perfectly.
6686260	6689142	It's like a mathematically perfect ice cream cone.
6689162	6689262	Yeah.
6691314	6706376	it's great anyway with that we're going to wrap up our show tonight thank you all so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and participating with our show tonight we appreciate you if you enjoyed what you heard here tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice

6739976	6742737	I've got to a point in my life where I'm just like, people can enjoy it.
6743218	6743678	You know what?
6745299	6747400	May your team sports better than the other.
6747860	6750462	May your seven-layer bean dip be wonderful.
6750562	6753463	Because that's what I associate that game day with is food.
6753744	6754224	Puppy bowl.
6754264	6755605	And seven-layer bean dip.
6755925	6757746	So I hope your seven-layer bean dip is amazing.
6758646	6760568	I want the puppy bowl and the kitten halftime.
6762627	6778559	yeah, Bobby in chat says I enjoy the gathering more than what's on the TV very that alright anyway, DarkSakura I imagine you're streaming tonight some Dead by Delight is there still limited modes going on?
6778639	6780280	is Chaos still a thing?
6780540	6790628	no although they're saying that the new 2v8 is coming and one of the killers that's going to be in it is Legion
6791668	6792290	Ah, oh boy.
6792310	6793673	So that means I have someone to play.
6795356	6801209	I got to see someone play the Tomie version of Spirit for the Junji Ito collection.
6801229	6801510	Mm-hmm.
6802378	6829396	and she's got different voice lines it's pretty sweet oh really I didn't know that Spirit's one of the killers I really love playing but I haven't played in so long at this point the Tomie skin is all the Junji Ito skins are perfect especially what they do with the twins for the family oh they are they're beautiful I mean I like I like the Tomie manga I hadn't seen the movies believe it or not but I was a big fan and then uh there's one for Kate I think that's the marionette
6831013	6859553	and then Jane has one where I gotta forget it's another of the ones I haven't seen but oh I think it's from the Balloon Head one the Balloon Head manga is really freaking creepy so anyway but yeah I'm gonna play alright we'll see what happens if I'm gonna kill or survive we'll see you in a few minutes then have a good stream oh final thought though before you go I gotta go to the bathroom let me go alright bye bye
6859963	6861204	Alright, then Loki, we go to you.
6861264	6862185	What's your final thought tonight?
6864086	6869591	Not much, but yeah, just have we're starting our new season here in about a couple weeks.
6870492	6874035	So new season, new map, new old projects and stuff.

6876517	6876877	Of course.
