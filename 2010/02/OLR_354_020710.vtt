00:00.000 --> 00:18.240
Tonight, February 7th, 2010, a new Sonic the Hedgehog game is announced.

00:18.240 --> 00:21.360
Could you soon get premium Warcraft features on your iPhone?

00:21.360 --> 00:31.640
And what first-person shooter is coming to Facebook?

00:31.640 --> 00:34.480
I hope it's a game where I can shoot all my old friends from high school.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.680
Hey, welcome back!

00:35.680 --> 00:40.120
You're listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.560
Apparently we're going to have to see theme songs.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.160
We're still having audio fail, even a week after having all our fun new equipment here

00:46.160 --> 00:47.160
in studio.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.680
Anyway, hi, we are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:51.680 --> 00:53.320
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
I'm here with you every week.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:55.320 --> 01:00.600
Joining me, as always, say hello to the lady shouting fail fail over there in the corner.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.120
Our very own fail blog here in house, Dark Sakura.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.120
Jamie.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
Fail!

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
How are you?

01:06.120 --> 01:07.560
I win.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.560
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Cookie Master Loki.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
Hello.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.000
How you doing, Cookie Master Loki?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.720
We're almost out of cookies.

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
All right.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.520
So, just so you know, we've renamed Loki, at least for tonight anyway, Cookie Master

01:19.520 --> 01:23.440
instead of Tech Master because he baked cookies and brought them.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.320
And I don't know about Jamie, but I like it when people bring cookies to the show.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.760
I like cookies.

01:27.760 --> 01:28.760
Yes.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.380
So, tonight he is Cookie Master Loki.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.000
But I'm sure he'll talk about tech here and there as well.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.360
In fact, you've been kind of over there hammering on YouTube, right?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.040
What's going on over there on YouTube, Loki?

01:38.040 --> 01:42.600
Well, they just uploaded my new video and disabled all the audio because they're awesome

01:42.600 --> 01:43.840
like that.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
What happened?

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
Copyright music.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Yeah, copyright.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.280
But there's tons of videos out there that have copyright music in them.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
That's lame.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
It's all right.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
We'll find someplace else to upload it because YouTube sucks.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.400
There you go.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.440
Or you could just play the song backwards.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
That's the other idea.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.440
Then they won't know.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.520
I just don't care.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.160
I have a sad announcement real quick.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.160
What's your sad announcement?

02:03.160 --> 02:07.320
The person who is going to be our youngest guest host ever can't make it.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
I'm sorry to hear it.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.320
He fell asleep in the car and needs a new diaper.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.720
I'm sorry to hear it.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.200
What about video games, what do you have talked about tonight you think?

02:16.200 --> 02:20.280
Probably daddy playing the game.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
What game?

02:21.280 --> 02:25.680
Well, right now I think Becky's husband, Chris is playing, um, Mass Effect.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.720
I was gonna say everybody's playing Mass Effect 2.

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
Except us.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.720
Yeah.

02:29.720 --> 02:30.720
For some reason, I just kind of missed it.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.720
Dan just went back and bought Bioshock.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.720
Wow.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
And he's been playing that.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.640
Well, let's talk about our gaming weeks and what the kind of games we've been playing.

02:35.640 --> 02:36.720
That's how we always start off the show.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.360
But hey, if you are joining us live on this Sunday evening, uh, first of all, thank you.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.360
Welcome.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.360
And thanks for listening to us live.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.760
I mean, if you're listening to us on the podcast, we still love that too.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.760
So thank you guys very much.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.360
But if you are listening live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, but you decided

02:49.360 --> 02:54.120
to take a break from the Super Bowl list, join us in our chat room, chat dot orange

02:54.120 --> 02:58.000
lounge radio.com to talk about all of tonight's video game topics, including the games we

02:58.000 --> 02:59.360
have been playing dark soccer.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.360
How was your gaming week?

03:00.360 --> 03:05.400
I played a crap ton of Star Trek online, and then I realized, um, when I decided to go

03:05.400 --> 03:09.520
on the quest to find deep space nine, that I just, my little character had been just

03:09.520 --> 03:13.720
running around the promenade for about an hour and a half, just running around, doing

03:13.720 --> 03:16.880
nothing, running around.

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
And that's about it.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.400
Well, I just have some like solitaire.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.280
You didn't play like actual solitaire on the computer?

03:23.280 --> 03:27.000
I didn't even, Oh, on the iPhone, I was gonna say, do they even include solitaire on the

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
computer anymore?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.760
Or is that, yeah, it's included that in spider solitaire and a few of it, few others hearts

03:32.760 --> 03:34.280
and freestyle and all that crap.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
All right.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.440
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:37.440 --> 03:39.560
It was pretty good.

03:39.560 --> 03:45.560
I played more Borderlands and, um, that's still entertaining me.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.040
Uh, more Grand Theft Auto finally made it.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.980
I'm in the top 100 players now, um, for true skill rankings.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.100
So I'm in like the mid nineties now for that.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.600
That's pretty awesome.

03:57.600 --> 04:03.400
And I'm working my way up just the cumulative, uh, ranked death match stats.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.280
So, um, I think I'm, I don't know, varies depending on how much I play it.

04:08.280 --> 04:12.360
Um, I think I'm around two 30 something right now.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.760
Um, and then I purchased a Bioshock two.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.160
So I played a little bit of that and that one's actually pretty cool.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.340
Very similar obviously through the first game.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.340
Now wait a minute.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.680
I thought Bioshock two was now till Tuesday, but you have the hookup, right?

04:25.680 --> 04:28.920
It's not out till Tuesday, but it's pretty awesome.

04:28.920 --> 04:35.600
Um, so yeah, uh, definitely, um, we're checking out, especially if you'd like the first game.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.760
It seems like there's going to be a lot of similarities between this game and the last

04:39.760 --> 04:40.760
one.

04:40.760 --> 04:41.760
But, um, so far I'm digging it.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
I don't know.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.360
Did they have multiplayer in this one?

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
They do.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.360
Yeah.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
Fun.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
That's going to, that's going to be the big kicker right there.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.520
Cause that was one kind of glaring omission in the first one and what a lot of people

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
were clamoring for.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.760
So I think that's probably the whole sale of the game right there.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.360
I don't know if I'll even play the multiplayer though.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.360
I, it just doesn't seem like anything I'd be interested in.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.360
Yeah, I know.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.080
Whenever I play those multiplayer shooting games, I get raped in the face and that's

05:04.080 --> 05:05.080
not a lot of fun.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
Well, not necessarily that.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.920
It just seems like tacked on or something, but whatever.

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
So that's it.

05:10.920 --> 05:11.920
All right.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.480
Um, my gaming week, kind of the same old stuff.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.280
I've been playing more Bayonetta and world of Warcraft and um, you know, some of those

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
games.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.080
The only new game I really checked out this week was one of the new Xbox live arcade games

05:21.080 --> 05:22.400
that they have called chime.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.640
Uh, somebody on Twitter had posted, Hey, if you like luminous, you should play chime.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.520
And yeah, I could definitely see where somebody is making the comparisons between chime and

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
luminous.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.720
They're both puzzle games.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.160
They're both heavily involved with music.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.120
They both have a beat line that sweeps across the screen and they have very similar looking

05:40.120 --> 05:42.600
screens, might I say, uh, that affects the gameplay.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.960
But where the games get very different is that, you know, you could say luminous is

05:45.960 --> 05:48.780
somewhat of a Tetris inspired game.

05:48.780 --> 05:51.960
Chime is like, I'm going to get really old school here and I bet half the listeners don't

05:51.960 --> 05:53.160
even know what I'm talking about.

05:53.160 --> 05:56.000
Chime is like the dallion Opus on the game boy.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.960
Anyone ever played to dallion Opus?

05:57.960 --> 05:58.960
Okay.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.360
A while back.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
Yeah.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.640
It's one of these games here since you probably haven't played it.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
Here's what it is.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.820
It's basically like you have all these shapes that you're trying to put into and they're

06:08.820 --> 06:12.400
all square based, but they might be in an L shape or a jagged shape and don't think

06:12.400 --> 06:16.280
just Tetris pieces because sometimes they're like five or six blocks in a row.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.520
Um, and uh, you, you try to fit them into this square or like, you know, some other

06:21.520 --> 06:22.640
type of geometric shape.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.640
I don't know.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.600
It's kind of like tangrams, but all based around Tetris style shapes, if that makes

06:27.600 --> 06:28.600
any sense at all.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
I don't know.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.600
You try to kind of fit them in there.

06:30.600 --> 06:36.420
So Chime is about trying to make three by three squares as fast as you can out of these

06:36.420 --> 06:40.320
odd shapes, which sound, it's a little harder than it sounds.

06:40.320 --> 06:45.520
Um, and so as you build these squares on the play field, there's nothing to do with dropping

06:45.520 --> 06:46.820
blocks or anything.

06:46.820 --> 06:51.160
You, uh, actually have free form to put the, put things down wherever you want on the play

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
field.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.400
Uh, but yeah, I have this odd fascination to still want to work from the ground up,

06:55.400 --> 06:59.160
even though, um, the pieces don't fall or anything like that.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.840
You just kind of can rotate them however you want and put them on the board.

07:02.840 --> 07:08.720
Ray Iannami in our chatroom, chat.orangelandrater.com, uh, Tetro, Tetro, Tetromino's, I think it's

07:08.720 --> 07:09.720
called.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.720
I think that's it.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
Yeah.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.720
What you're talking about there.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Same kind of idea.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.280
Um, so anyway, here's the thing is that as you build these blocks, your multiplier goes

07:17.280 --> 07:18.760
up the faster you build them.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.080
And, and oddly enough, yeah, it enhances the music as you build.

07:23.080 --> 07:29.120
Uh, there's songs by Moby, one of the guys from Orbital, uh, Philip Glass has a song

07:29.120 --> 07:30.860
in there, which I thought was totally random.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.200
So there's some, actually some big name talent in the game, probably only about five songs

07:34.200 --> 07:38.480
in the game, but it's only a $5 game and I don't know, maybe there'll be expansions later.

07:38.480 --> 07:44.540
Um, but anyhow, the, the beat sweeper will kind of sweep out your crap if you leave it

07:44.540 --> 07:45.540
behind too long.

07:45.540 --> 07:49.800
Like if you've let these isolated pieces that didn't get formed into blocks, it, uh, the

07:49.800 --> 07:54.120
beat sweeper will filter them out after it gets hit maybe like five times and then they

07:54.120 --> 07:57.700
all flush out and you lose your multiplayer, multiplier.

07:57.700 --> 08:03.160
So, um, it's good for cleaning up the board, but it's bad for your score.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.000
So that's the gist of Chime.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.280
Um, it's actually kind of a neat little puzzler.

08:07.280 --> 08:12.520
I, I, I thought it was kind of cool and, uh, the music was very trancy, zoney, but I thought

08:12.520 --> 08:14.880
it was decent for a game like that.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.400
And best of all, it's only $5, even though it's only five songs.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.280
Now here's the thing, is that the game is supposed to go for charity.

08:22.280 --> 08:26.880
Like they, they really advertise heavily in the game that 60% of the purchase price goes

08:26.880 --> 08:30.760
to these various children's charities and you can go online and look.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.540
What I thought was a little weird though is that they actually, as part of the sales pitch

08:34.540 --> 08:38.760
of the game say, buy this game and feel good about supporting charities.

08:38.760 --> 08:43.440
Oh, and you get 50 gamer score just for buying the game.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.680
Because there's an achievement that is called something like, and I'm paraphrasing here,

08:47.680 --> 08:49.980
feel good about yourself, 50 gamer score.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.840
You can feel good about yourself and the purchase you've made of this game.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.920
And it just gives you basically 50 gamer score for, I guess, going to the title screen.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.060
I thought that was a little weird, like, yeah, I get it.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.060
It's for charity.

09:01.060 --> 09:02.060
It's a good thing.

09:02.060 --> 09:03.060
Da da da.

09:03.060 --> 09:08.280
But you're essentially buying gamer score if you think about it that way and it's, it's

09:08.280 --> 09:11.840
not that I necessarily have a problem with that, with the charity angle, but the fact

09:11.840 --> 09:16.200
that it's kind of marketed like that is a little, I don't want to say off-putting, but

09:16.200 --> 09:17.640
that's the best word I can think of.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.280
I would say though that it's more of like a, just a little way of saying thank you for

09:21.280 --> 09:23.480
your donation.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.440
I think that badge should be worth zero gamer score if that's the case.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.600
Like I'm okay with there being like a little badge of pride, like, yay, have your warm

09:31.600 --> 09:33.640
fuzzies for buying our charity game.

09:33.640 --> 09:37.460
But I don't think it should be worth any gamer score and I don't think they should be advertising

09:37.460 --> 09:40.960
like, hey, if you buy this game, we'll give you 50 gamer score just for getting it.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.960
Like, I don't know, for me that just kind of, it just seems like it opens the floodgates

09:45.960 --> 09:47.600
to all this kind of like devious behavior.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.140
Like I understand it's for charity and maybe like Microsoft kind of let them get away with

09:51.140 --> 09:52.140
that for all that.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.640
And I'm not trying to like knock the game.

09:53.640 --> 09:57.600
It just, when I kind of looked at that, I kind of made one of those raised eyebrow faces

09:57.600 --> 10:02.200
of that's, that ain't right, that, that ain't right.

10:02.200 --> 10:07.240
But hey, it is for charity and heck, what games anymore are only five bucks on Xbox

10:07.240 --> 10:10.880
Live and the music, you know, some good talent.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.680
It's a little bit ambient and not, well, at least the demo song, like I don't know what

10:14.680 --> 10:15.760
other songs are in the game.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.200
I didn't watch the trailer or what have you.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.640
So I'm assuming there's some other fast paced stuff.

10:19.640 --> 10:24.920
But I think for just like a good little chill out game, five bucks is not asking too much.

10:24.920 --> 10:30.120
And yeah, despite my little issue with the 50 gamer score for free, it is a feel good

10:30.120 --> 10:33.160
thing that you can do like, hey, I bought this game and the money's going to charity.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.480
So that's pretty cool.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.920
So that was pretty much my gaming week, all things considered.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.720
So those are pretty much the games I was playing.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
How about you guys in chat?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.400
How was your gaming week?

10:44.400 --> 10:51.200
Some guys in chat kind of talking about the charity thing I was just talking about chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.800
Kevin DDR in chat says, only thing that irritated me was the different choice of pieces on different

10:55.800 --> 10:56.800
songs.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.440
I think that's something that fundamental to the gameplay strategy would stay consistent.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.440
Interesting.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.160
Kevin DDR said, also said, I assumed achievements generally got the amount of points based on

11:06.160 --> 11:08.320
the relative difficulty of the achievement.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.080
I guess, unfortunately, some developers don't want to do that.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.880
Very good point because that 50 gamer score achievement is like the biggest one in that

11:14.880 --> 11:17.520
game because they only have 200 to work with.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.640
And the rest of the achievements are, some of them are fairly difficult, at least from

11:21.640 --> 11:23.320
the little bit I played.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.820
So there you go.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.360
Some comments from chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
Some housekeeping tonight.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.520
Of course, we always like to plug our Twitter and our Facebook, www.Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

11:33.520 --> 11:37.200
If you want to follow us on Twitter, we do a segment of the show called Twitter topics

11:37.200 --> 11:41.420
up a little later where you guys can get your questions and your story suggestions done

11:41.420 --> 11:42.480
right here on the show.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.400
We like to pitch ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.680
So we want you guys to be heard.

11:48.680 --> 11:53.300
Facebook is also another way you can follow us at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.920
And you can join our little Facebook club there.

11:54.920 --> 11:58.400
And we like to post little updates with what's going on behind the scenes.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.080
Plenty of other places you can interact with us.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.040
If you want to see more, because we're on like Last.fm and Steam, if you want to see

12:04.040 --> 12:09.860
everything, just head to our website, www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and look at the little box in the corner that

12:09.860 --> 12:11.160
says extended play.

12:11.160 --> 12:15.260
And there's all these different links to all the places where we have little communities

12:15.260 --> 12:16.260
and so forth.

12:16.260 --> 12:21.600
Speaking of community, we want to thank the community at AllGames.com, www.AllGames.com.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.520
It's All Games Radio and it's the place where we do tape our show live every Sunday night.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.760
And as I always say on the show, if you don't like what you hear from us, maybe one of the

12:29.760 --> 12:34.160
other shows on the network is more your cup of tea because as mentioned before, I think

12:34.160 --> 12:37.680
Jamie mentioned, everybody she knows is playing Mass Effect 2, but we're all sitting here

12:37.680 --> 12:41.480
going, well, we just really haven't been playing that because I've been too busy playing Bayonetta

12:41.480 --> 12:47.520
and Raiding and Dark Soccer has been too busy playing Star Trek Online and so forth.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.520
But I'm sure there's lots of other shows where they're talking about Mass Effect 2 nonstop.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.320
So if that's more your cup of tea, hey, cool.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.400
But if you do like our show, one last little plug, please visit iTunes, search for Orange

12:56.400 --> 12:59.080
Lounge Radio and leave us a nice little review.

12:59.080 --> 13:04.800
iTunes, by the way, recently changed the podcast page format to kind of match the rest of the

13:04.800 --> 13:06.480
CDs and things in the marketplace.

13:06.480 --> 13:10.160
So if you go visit Orange Lounge Radio, you can see like the most popular shows in our

13:10.160 --> 13:13.740
feed and so forth, although I think it's a little early to really be tracking those type

13:13.740 --> 13:15.720
of statistics, but I thought it was neat.

13:15.720 --> 13:20.720
You can see the little cover arts of the shows that it suggests, like people who listen to

13:20.720 --> 13:24.400
Orange Lounge Radio also like, and it shows all the little cover art.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.100
You know who the number one show is that suggested?

13:27.100 --> 13:30.240
People who also listen to Orange Lounge Radio also like, you know what the number one show

13:30.240 --> 13:31.240
is?

13:31.240 --> 13:32.240
In the list?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
Any guesses?

13:33.240 --> 13:34.240
Do tell.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.000
Bobby Black Wolf, our good pal Bobby is the number one suggestion.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.600
Of course he is because, you know, we're on right back to back on all games radio.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.960
I'm sure we're number one on his list too.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.400
All right.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.160
Also getting information from our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat or

13:49.160 --> 13:51.300
you can go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

13:51.300 --> 13:56.400
Tiger Claw says, hey, this just in, Dante's Inferno ad just played during the fourth quarter

13:56.400 --> 14:00.560
because they're watching the Super Bowl right now with the tagline, hell awaits, which if

14:00.560 --> 14:03.840
I remember it, wasn't there some controversy that they weren't going to air that promo

14:03.840 --> 14:04.840
because of the tagline?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.040
They just made them edit it so it wasn't saying go to hell.

14:07.040 --> 14:08.040
I see.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.040
That's right.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
It was going to say, go to hell.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
Now it's hell awaits.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.040
Who cares?

14:12.040 --> 14:13.040
It doesn't matter.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.040
Little weird.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.040
I did play the demo for that game.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
It was, it was neat.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.720
It's kind of God of War-ish, but fun.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.720
Yeah.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.920
So not that, I mean, being God of War is not a bad thing.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
All right.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.160
Let's get into some gaming news.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.900
Lots of gaming news this week, surprisingly enough, we're really starting to kind of kick

14:25.900 --> 14:31.320
into the year and all the game news and Loki starting us off with some big news, right?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
Yes.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.720
Um, this is, I don't know if it's completely big news.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.240
I mean, kind of, we could have figured this out pretty simple.

14:38.240 --> 14:42.700
Uh, Project Needlemouse, you know, the project that they were working on that was a 2D Sonic

14:42.700 --> 14:43.700
game.

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
Well, guess what?

14:44.700 --> 14:45.700
It's Sonic 4.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.600
Oh my God.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.800
That's a surprise, except it's not.

14:49.800 --> 14:55.140
Um, what is kind of unique about it is it's going to be available only as an episodic

14:55.140 --> 14:58.320
game and it's available on all the different download services.

14:58.320 --> 15:05.120
We wear PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, um, so it's kind of cool.

15:05.120 --> 15:12.020
And I guess the first episode will be available this summer and, um, hopefully it's good.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.080
I don't know.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.820
I'm just not that excited about it.

15:15.820 --> 15:16.820
That's all.

15:16.820 --> 15:21.020
Is it because maybe there hasn't been like a really, really like OMG squee in my pants

15:21.020 --> 15:22.800
exciting Sonic game?

15:22.800 --> 15:26.020
Because they always say, oh, we're going to do what people wanted us to do.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.120
And then they fuck it up somehow.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.240
You know, it's, I don't know.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.880
Some comments in our chat seem to agree.

15:32.880 --> 15:39.040
Ray Iannami says, can Sega not fuck up Sonic 4?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.880
Dark Sakura, I know you're a big Sonic fan girl.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.880
What was your reaction to the trailer?

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
Squee?

15:44.880 --> 15:47.080
I'm going to take a cookie.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.520
Yeah, you better eat that last cookie before I do.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.640
But here's, no, no, no, I don't need any more cookies.

15:52.640 --> 15:58.800
But here, um, I have to admit, I, even though the trailer didn't show much, I mean, it just

15:58.800 --> 16:03.800
kind of showed the whole idea of, hey, we're making a new Sonic game in the original Genesis

16:03.800 --> 16:07.520
game canon, which we haven't touched in what, 15 years, I think.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.040
So maybe longer than that.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
I don't know.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.040
But it is the updated model.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.040
Right.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.420
And what I thought was interesting is that, you know, the little glimpse of gameplay you

16:14.420 --> 16:21.040
see was a very Sonic 3 corkscrew looking thing that just looked very souped up in 3d.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.880
Like, it's interesting, Mega Man 9 has sort of opened the floodgates to this kind of stuff,

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
in a way.

16:26.880 --> 16:27.880
I don't know.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.640
Do you think this was inspired by the success of Mega Man 9, or do you think Sega's just

16:30.640 --> 16:31.960
finally getting the hint?

16:31.960 --> 16:36.360
People just want the old shit with a new coat of paint, or what?

16:36.360 --> 16:41.720
Well, I've noticed, and this is almost with any type of genre, be it art, music, whatever,

16:41.720 --> 16:47.280
a lot of times you get this going towards the bigger the better, the whole, you know,

16:47.280 --> 16:51.560
brand new, shiny, 3d, whatever, digital.

16:51.560 --> 16:56.600
But there comes a phase in everything that you go back to the old way of doing.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.080
You know, you want the classic look, you want the classic play.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.160
You know, else we wouldn't have, you know, Sonic 4, we wouldn't have the new Mega Man

17:04.160 --> 17:05.160
games.

17:05.160 --> 17:10.640
I mean, shoot, even art's done the same thing, like right after the Victorian age, you know,

17:10.640 --> 17:15.360
we kind of around the same time there were people that were going back to the old handmade

17:15.360 --> 17:16.780
way of doing things.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.420
So I think it's just culture.

17:19.420 --> 17:20.420
It's going to happen.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.420
It was bound to happen.

17:21.420 --> 17:22.880
History repeats itself kind of thing?

17:22.880 --> 17:23.880
Exactly.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
Interesting.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.880
Some comments in chat.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.480
Hitstun says, well, Sega did a great job with Outrun 2.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.840
There is hope.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.520
I'm not sure if we're thinking of the same game here, but there was an Outrun game.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
I don't think it was Outrun 2.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.160
There was an Outrun game on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.800
Yeah, Outrun 2000, that was it.

17:38.800 --> 17:39.800
Not that long ago.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.200
And that was kind of cool.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.340
Like for a, it wasn't like, OMG, best game ever.

17:45.340 --> 17:48.840
But for it, like a little arcade racing game that kind of invoked the old style of Outrun,

17:48.840 --> 17:49.880
I enjoyed it.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.360
I think I did buy the full version and played it a little bit.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.360
It was fun.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.360
It had magical sound shower.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.360
And that's the important thing.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.360
It sure did.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.360
It was.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.360
It was magical sound shower.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.360
Uh, let's see.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.360
And some other comments in chat room.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.920
Uh, Frisbee says, I think this is Sega's final try.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
Interesting comment.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.000
Do you think that if this doesn't live up to the hype that Sonic's done, it's, it's

18:09.000 --> 18:11.120
a done franchise?

18:11.120 --> 18:12.920
Bury it?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.520
I think Sonic isn't going to die.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.720
No, I don't think Sonic could die either.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.920
Something to think about, even if Sonic 4 tanks, which I highly doubt it will, I think

18:20.920 --> 18:24.080
they're doing the right thing and invoking the past here.

18:24.080 --> 18:29.240
Even if, for whatever crazy ass reason Sonic 4 tanks, let's not forget, Mario and Sonic

18:29.240 --> 18:33.280
at the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics and all that stuff was huge on the Nintendo

18:33.280 --> 18:34.280
Wii.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.400
So Sonic as a character, I think still has a lot of kind of clout, if you will.

18:38.400 --> 18:43.480
It's just that oddly enough, if Sonic 4 were to tank, which again, I don't think it will,

18:43.480 --> 18:46.600
uh, Sonic would mainly exist in Nintendo franchises.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.360
Isn't that weird?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
Little.

18:50.360 --> 18:55.040
Like it blows my mind, you know, and I was gaming back in the day, you know, as all of

18:55.040 --> 18:59.640
his hosts were back in, you know, 90 and 91 when all these systems was Mario versus Sonic

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
and so forth.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.800
It'd just be interesting if Sonic 4 were to tank, I think Sonic would just kind of have

19:04.800 --> 19:06.720
to become a Nintendo character in all their games.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.720
That'd pretty much be how it would exist, but I don't think it will tank.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.320
What about the episodic nature of the game?

19:11.320 --> 19:15.400
Do you think the episodic nature is a little weird or do you think that's just where games

19:15.400 --> 19:17.080
are going these days?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.540
I think it's just the way things are going.

19:19.540 --> 19:23.840
It's gonna suck for them because now, since they're not putting out a full retail version,

19:23.840 --> 19:29.020
I'm assuming it's gonna be cheaper and if people really hate the game, they're not out

19:29.020 --> 19:30.720
as much money.

19:30.720 --> 19:35.080
Which is good for the consumer, bad for Sega.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.680
Do you think maybe they're just doing this so that by the time they put out episode 1,

19:38.680 --> 19:42.560
episode 2, episode 3, they make about as much money as they would have if they just put

19:42.560 --> 19:44.360
the game out on DVD, Blu-ray?

19:44.360 --> 19:48.000
Pretty much, but that's assuming if everybody buys all the, you know, parts to it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
I guess that's a good point.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.640
Alright, chat.orangehonestrader.com if you want to comment on this.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.520
Was there anything else for this story, Loki, you wanted to add?

19:56.520 --> 20:00.880
Yeah, I was also gonna say that one other platform that it's supposed to be coming out

20:00.880 --> 20:05.640
on is the iPhone and that's kind of typical with anything nowadays.

20:05.640 --> 20:10.200
Of course, I'm gonna assume since it's on the iPhone, it's gonna control like shit.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.200
That's just my guess.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.320
That is a little weird that it's coming to the iPhone because, you know, I'm not a big

20:14.320 --> 20:18.120
fan of all these games getting adapted to the iPhone because the touch thing is a little

20:18.120 --> 20:19.120
weird.

20:19.120 --> 20:22.120
But, I don't know.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.160
Some comments, more comments from our chat room, chat.orangehonestrader.com.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.840
Tigerclaw says, the fact that the game is episodic probably means you will have your

20:29.840 --> 20:32.440
epic boss battle against Doc Robotnik.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.440
Wasn't that a given?

20:33.440 --> 20:38.160
You have every stage, you always have to have your Doc Robotnik battle at the end?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.560
That's every stage, right?

20:39.560 --> 20:44.040
Oh, Tigerclaw says, actually, he's correcting that you will not have your epic boss battle

20:44.040 --> 20:45.560
against Doc Robotnik.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.520
So maybe that like you have like mini-bosses.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
I don't know how that would work.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.080
SSJ100Matt says, it should have Michael Jackson music in it.

20:55.080 --> 20:59.140
Well, I don't know if that's gonna be very possible at this point unless they were working

20:59.140 --> 21:04.360
in secret, you know, more than a year ago, but I somehow doubt that is the case.

21:04.360 --> 21:09.220
Well, I think all of us in studio kind of agree though we will pick up Sonic 4, at least

21:09.220 --> 21:10.220
check it out.

21:10.220 --> 21:14.240
I know I will, because I do love the old Sonic games and I'm all about checking out the new

21:14.240 --> 21:15.240
one.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.680
I'm sure, I know Jamie's gonna buy it, I don't even have to ask her.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.200
Matt, will you buy it?

21:20.200 --> 21:21.200
Nope.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
One hold out.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.540
Why not, dare I ask?

21:24.540 --> 21:28.080
Because I haven't bought any of the Sonic games, I just don't care.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.320
All right.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.920
It's not really a game that I really got into.

21:31.920 --> 21:37.640
Well, maybe Loki will care about this, I know I sure did because I let out the biggest fangirl

21:37.640 --> 21:42.540
scream when I saw this, like seriously, I'm not even joking, when I saw this last week.

21:42.540 --> 21:46.000
Talk about out of right field, okay, this came out of nowhere.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.520
Sunsoft, remember they reformed, not that long ago, announced that Blaster Master Overdrive

21:52.520 --> 21:53.880
is on its way out.

21:53.880 --> 21:59.200
That's right, a remade new version of Blaster Master, although I do not believe this is

21:59.200 --> 22:00.320
like a remake.

22:00.320 --> 22:05.040
It is actually a sequel of the NES classic, we're just kind of forgetting that, you know,

22:05.040 --> 22:09.280
Blaster Master 2 on Genesis and the Game Boy one never happened, but this is the sequel

22:09.280 --> 22:14.880
to Blaster Master will be coming out on WiiWare for 1000 Wii points.

22:14.880 --> 22:18.000
Here's what I think is the biggest twist out of this whole thing.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.720
They said, oh yeah, and the game, it's coming out Monday, as in tomorrow.

22:23.720 --> 22:27.920
As in, we've kept this a secret for however long we've been working on this and hey, now

22:27.920 --> 22:29.360
it's out now, you can buy it.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.760
And there's even a little trailer out there that shows some of the gameplay, I'm playing

22:32.760 --> 22:38.640
a little bit of it in studio because awesome enough, it has a remixed version of the theme.

22:38.640 --> 22:42.840
I don't like the remixed version of the theme, it kind of like fucks it up.

22:42.840 --> 22:47.120
You know what, nothing is ever going to be as good as the original, that's really what

22:47.120 --> 22:48.120
it is.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
I don't like this one at all.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.160
But this is not bad, it could have been a lot worse.

22:51.160 --> 22:59.200
But you could definitely see it 16 by 9, the overhead stages look a lot different.

22:59.200 --> 23:04.880
I don't know, this game just kind of has more of a Metroid look to it, which I'm all over

23:04.880 --> 23:05.880
that.

23:05.880 --> 23:06.880
That's pretty sweet.

23:06.880 --> 23:11.920
Yeah, it's like some of these overhead levels have like ice themes and kind of like more

23:11.920 --> 23:20.680
cavern themes, whereas I don't remember that being the case in the first one.

23:20.680 --> 23:26.520
So yeah, Blaster Master Overdrive out Monday and yeah, you should have been there when

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
I read this.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.600
I was just like, oh my god, oh my god.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.320
I started flailing all about, it's pretty cool.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.160
So yeah, 1000 Wii points and that comes out on Monday.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.760
I'm assuming Loki's not going to be buying that, but I will.

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
Probably not.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
Dark Sakura?

23:43.760 --> 23:47.400
Yeah, maybe, they'll probably be up Dan Valley.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.080
Now Loki, which would you rather play, Sonic 4 or Blaster Master Overdrive?

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
Blaster Master.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Oh, okay.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.280
I had to ask, I had to.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.920
Dark Sakura, what do you got?

23:56.920 --> 24:01.600
Well it was bound to happen, I think that it was expected, you know, maybe sooner rather

24:01.600 --> 24:08.280
than now, but Xbox Live is going to be canceling out support for the original console and that's

24:08.280 --> 24:11.040
going into effect on April 15th.

24:11.040 --> 24:17.320
And it's also not just the console, but for games that are compatible with both the 360

24:17.320 --> 24:18.960
and the old Xbox.

24:18.960 --> 24:25.320
So they're basically saying that because more people now are really on the Xbox 360, that

24:25.320 --> 24:30.080
that's what they want to focus their power on and cut the support so they can focus more

24:30.080 --> 24:32.880
fully on the newer system.

24:32.880 --> 24:36.920
In other words, buy Halo 2, because that's, yeah, that's really the Xbox game everybody's

24:36.920 --> 24:37.920
still playing.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.160
I mean, yeah, I guess there's some others, maybe Counter Strike and a few others here

24:40.160 --> 24:42.640
and there, but it's really all about the Halo 2.

24:42.640 --> 24:47.080
Yeah, they were saying that Halo 2 was the top usage.

24:47.080 --> 24:51.000
I think Halo 2's been the top game on Xbox, original Xbox of course, ever since the game

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
came out.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.960
And you know, there's a lot of people that feel that Halo 3 did not really, and I would

24:54.960 --> 24:58.200
say I'm one of them, didn't really live up to Halo 2 in some ways.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.040
Well they're saying also that the other big thing is that the changes that they want to

25:01.040 --> 25:06.780
make to the service are, as I say, incompatible with the original games, with the old games.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.800
And I think a lot of people are already aware of this, but just in case you hadn't heard,

25:10.800 --> 25:15.940
one of those big hindrances is that, you know, a lot of people asking, when can we have more

25:15.940 --> 25:17.900
than a hundred people on our friends list?

25:17.900 --> 25:20.220
We want to increase the number of people on the friends list.

25:20.220 --> 25:24.140
And the reason why they can't do it is because of original Xbox.

25:24.140 --> 25:29.820
It's basically hardwired into games like Halo 2 and so forth that Xbox Live only has a hundred

25:29.820 --> 25:31.340
slots on it, basically.

25:31.340 --> 25:36.760
So that's one of the big things that getting rid of the original Xbox games and shutting

25:36.760 --> 25:39.380
down Halo 2 and so forth will free up.

25:39.380 --> 25:43.400
And I would say by the end of the year, probably whenever the patch comes out for Natal, your

25:43.400 --> 25:48.320
friends list is going to get a big bump and you'll be able to have 250, 500, maybe even

25:48.320 --> 25:49.320
unlimited friends.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.320
I don't know.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.640
And I'm sure there are some other technical components that we're just not aware of because

25:53.640 --> 25:57.840
we haven't thought of them yet, but there's some other things that they have to shut off

25:57.840 --> 25:59.460
these games for.

25:59.460 --> 26:04.380
But on the flip side, there's a lot of, as you can understand, ticked off people still

26:04.380 --> 26:10.400
playing the original Xbox, still playing Halo 2, haven't upgraded to Xbox 360 yet that are

26:10.400 --> 26:12.740
very sad about this news.

26:12.740 --> 26:13.740
What do you guys think?

26:13.740 --> 26:14.740
Too bad, so sad?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.300
It's time to give it up and put it away?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.160
Or do they make a case?

26:18.160 --> 26:21.020
Maybe Microsoft needs to find a way to still support this.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.020
Who cares?

26:22.020 --> 26:26.300
I mean, seriously, how many people are still playing the original Xbox, upgrade, get a

26:26.300 --> 26:27.300
new system?

26:27.300 --> 26:29.900
I mean, it's bound to happen that they're going to shut off servers.

26:29.900 --> 26:34.620
I mean, just because you're paying for it now, okay, great, you know, that you're paying

26:34.620 --> 26:38.340
for it month to month, well, now you're not.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.820
So I don't know.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.580
I don't really feel sad about these people.

26:43.580 --> 26:48.140
I do find it strange, okay, the original Xbox games couldn't be patched or whatever, I get

26:48.140 --> 26:54.700
that, but I do find it strange that Microsoft won't find a way to still let Halo 2 be playable

26:54.700 --> 26:56.540
on the 360.

26:56.540 --> 26:57.540
You know what I mean?

26:57.540 --> 27:01.780
Like via a patch or via, you know, because Halo 2 is an on-demand game, it's a download

27:01.780 --> 27:06.940
game, so that you could fix it, so that you could still play it on Xbox 360 at least.

27:06.940 --> 27:10.140
You know, fix whatever is the problem with the friends list and play it that way.

27:10.140 --> 27:12.300
You would think they would do that, but they're not.

27:12.300 --> 27:16.400
Tigerclaw does bring up a good point, though, in our chat room, chat.orangeontrated.com.

27:16.400 --> 27:19.540
People can still play Halo 2 multiplayer if they get the PC version.

27:19.540 --> 27:24.140
So, you know, Halo 2 is not forgotten for everybody.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.540
Let's see, Hitstun in our chat says, if you have an original Xbox and it's not modded,

27:27.540 --> 27:28.900
it's time to mod it.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.980
And that also makes me think of the fact that, you know, you could also go the way of the

27:31.980 --> 27:36.420
original Halo, and if you really want to play your Halo 2 or your Halo, it's time to break

27:36.420 --> 27:37.420
out the LAN party.

27:37.420 --> 27:40.340
You know, we still do that sometimes.

27:40.340 --> 27:41.340
Yeah?

27:41.340 --> 27:44.940
Yeah, we would have, like, the TVs all over the house, and the, actually, I'll tell you

27:44.940 --> 27:51.860
what's funny, Dan's bachelor party was really a bunch of people over playing, you know,

27:51.860 --> 27:54.740
all the systems on LAN, so.

27:54.740 --> 27:58.100
GameGuru in chat is correcting me that Halo 2 isn't a game on demand.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.740
My bad, I assumed that it was.

27:59.740 --> 28:02.680
I guess Halo 1 is, but not Halo 2.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.680
My bad.

28:03.680 --> 28:09.220
Well, okay, but let me just say to that then, okay, make it a game on demand, and make it

28:09.220 --> 28:10.220
so that it works.

28:10.220 --> 28:13.500
It seems a little strange to me, but I guess maybe they want people to go PC.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.500
I don't know.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.780
XLink in our chat room says, EA does it all the time.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.780
That's true.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.060
EA shuts down servers for old games, and we kind of go, well, they're old, there's new

28:22.060 --> 28:26.740
versions of the game out, and sure enough, there is Halo 3 and Halo ODST out at this

28:26.740 --> 28:27.740
point.

28:27.740 --> 28:33.420
I did like what Sega did when they closed the PSO servers, is that for the people that

28:33.420 --> 28:38.500
were running private servers, they actually gave them a way to transfer characters and

28:38.500 --> 28:39.500
things.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.480
And I would think that if, you know, people are actually still playing that, then there

28:42.480 --> 28:47.820
should be some other way to host your own server for it or something, you know, and

28:47.820 --> 28:49.460
have that be like an external.

28:49.460 --> 28:53.340
For some reason, I don't see Microsoft supporting that out of the companies.

28:53.340 --> 28:57.380
Like, I could see why Sega would do that, but I could see why Microsoft would not, if

28:57.380 --> 28:58.380
that makes sense.

28:58.380 --> 29:02.140
And SHA100Matt in our chat room says, in the end, nothing lasts forever.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.380
And I guess that's another point as well, is that, hey, you know, that game, you got

29:05.380 --> 29:07.980
a good six or seven year run out of it, right?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.500
No, no, wait, I'm saying too much.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.540
That's how long Xbox Live has been around.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.900
Halo 2 has probably been going, what, about four or five years?

29:15.900 --> 29:16.900
About.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.500
It came out while we were doing this show.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.500
Oh, five is when it came out.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.300
I played Halo 1 for the first time, and we were on the air, so it has been around for

29:23.300 --> 29:24.300
five years now.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.300
Five years.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.700
That's a pretty good run.

29:27.700 --> 29:31.380
Game Guru in chat says Microsoft will more than likely make Halo 2 an Xbox Live Arcade

29:31.380 --> 29:32.380
title if anything.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.380
I could see that.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.380
I could see that.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.380
That'd be kind of cool.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.380
That would be kind of cool, actually.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.820
That might actually bring me back to Halo 2.

29:37.820 --> 29:38.820
I don't know.

29:38.820 --> 29:42.420
Especially with some super graphics and so forth, but, oh well.

29:42.420 --> 29:47.040
I think, again in chat, you said it good, nothing lasts forever, and some day they're

29:47.040 --> 29:50.700
going to shut down the servers for all the games we're playing today.

29:50.700 --> 29:54.260
Probably in five years when we've moved on to the Xbox 720s and so forth.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.540
I just wanted to tell a quick story real quick before we get into the next story, though,

29:57.540 --> 30:01.220
and I think I've told this on the show before, in fact I know I have, but when Dark Soccer

30:01.220 --> 30:05.020
brought up the LAN party and the things her husband did, I have to talk about the first

30:05.020 --> 30:07.320
time I ever went to Dark Soccer's house.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.900
Not this house, but the house she used to live in.

30:08.900 --> 30:09.900
The two story apartment?

30:09.900 --> 30:10.900
In the ghetto.

30:10.900 --> 30:11.900
Or the hood house?

30:11.900 --> 30:12.900
In the ghetto.

30:12.900 --> 30:13.900
Oh, with the big vaulted ceiling and the bad carpet?

30:13.900 --> 30:14.900
Yes.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.900
Yeah.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.020
And it was the first time I believe I ever met your husband and George and some of the

30:17.020 --> 30:19.500
friends that your husband hangs out with.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.340
I walked in the house.

30:21.340 --> 30:26.660
There's TVs all over the house, like a TV on the kitchen table, a TV in the living room.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.660
The nest party.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.660
A TV everywhere.

30:28.660 --> 30:34.140
And they all had Nintendos hooked up and I was like, what the hell is going on here?

30:34.140 --> 30:38.420
And Jamie's like, they're having a LAN party, a local area Nintendo party.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.540
All these TVs had Nintendo systems hooked up and they were playing the Legend of Zelda.

30:42.540 --> 30:48.080
And I guess they were having a contest to see who could beat the Legend of Zelda first.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.560
And some people were like already on the seventh dungeon, like I think your husband was really

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
far ahead.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.560
I think Dan actually won that one.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.560
I'm sure he did.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.900
And some people were still struggling.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.940
They were on like dungeon three and some people were in the overworld, so I couldn't really

30:58.940 --> 31:03.260
tell where they were at, but I just remember thinking that is the fucking coolest thing

31:03.260 --> 31:04.520
I've ever seen.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.580
Like I was like, Jamie and I are going to get along just fine because this had to be

31:07.580 --> 31:08.900
about a year before we started OLR.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.660
I mean, it was, it was a while before OLR, but I was just remember thinking, wow, this

31:13.660 --> 31:16.100
is all kinds of awesome.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.020
I kind of miss that house except don't miss where it was.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.020
Yeah.

31:20.020 --> 31:22.860
So anyway, I just wanted to tell that story if you never heard it before here on the show

31:22.860 --> 31:24.460
because I always think that's hilarious.

31:24.460 --> 31:30.300
And I would, I would love nothing more than to see another LAN party happen somewhere

31:30.300 --> 31:31.300
somehow.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.300
I think that would be a lot of fun.

31:32.300 --> 31:36.220
So if there's ever, if Dan ever decides he's doing another Nintendo party, I want in.

31:36.220 --> 31:41.180
I have to bring my FC mobile because keep in mind that we probably got three other NESs

31:41.180 --> 31:42.660
and you have, you have an NES.

31:42.660 --> 31:43.660
Well that's right.

31:43.660 --> 31:44.660
I do have the NES.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.500
I do have that, but I don't have a Zelda cart, but we can get one.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.620
Like I've got like three of them hanging around somewhere.

31:49.620 --> 31:53.900
One of the batteries I think finally died in one of them, but we've also got Zelda two.

31:53.900 --> 31:57.580
Those batteries were only guaranteed to last like five years, but most of them have lasted

31:57.580 --> 31:58.580
like 20.

31:58.580 --> 31:59.580
Yeah.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.580
Pretty crazy.

32:00.580 --> 32:01.580
All right.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.580
Anyhow.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.580
Sorry guys.

32:03.580 --> 32:04.580
Got a little tangent, but that happens here on this show sometimes.

32:04.580 --> 32:07.820
Uh, Loki, bring us back with some more gaming news.

32:07.820 --> 32:08.820
Yes.

32:08.820 --> 32:13.780
Um, so you know, Facebook's been getting a lot of games recently and a lot of them been

32:13.780 --> 32:18.460
pretty basic and they're starting to get some better stuff like new with new civilization

32:18.460 --> 32:24.080
game and whatnot, but now they're actually getting a first person shooter game.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.380
This game's called Brave Arms and actually looks kind of cool.

32:27.380 --> 32:33.300
Kind of like a, I don't know if like the quake online stuff like quake zero or whatever,

32:33.300 --> 32:34.700
but um, it's pretty cool.

32:34.700 --> 32:42.700
It's from three G studios and um, apparently it's set to come out in March and it's kind

32:42.700 --> 32:49.700
of similar to like a doom quake halo call of duty and that's what they should just call

32:49.700 --> 32:52.540
the game doom quake halo call of duty.

32:52.540 --> 32:53.540
Yeah.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.540
Nice.

32:54.540 --> 32:59.340
So see, when I first read about this, you know what kind of made me laugh as I imagined

32:59.340 --> 33:03.300
because most of the games that you play on Facebook, like the Farmville's and the Yo

33:03.300 --> 33:09.020
Ville's and the, I don't know, whatever else, but jewel blitz even, you kind of play against

33:09.020 --> 33:13.420
other people and other people's avatars and other people's default user pictures and so

33:13.420 --> 33:14.420
forth.

33:14.420 --> 33:18.000
Like the image I got in my mind when I first heard this story is that I could actually

33:18.000 --> 33:22.460
shoot my friends like their little face pictures on like bodies.

33:22.460 --> 33:23.460
Wouldn't that be funny?

33:23.460 --> 33:24.460
That would be funny.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.460
That would be hilarious.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.460
But that's probably not what this is.

33:26.460 --> 33:27.460
Is it?

33:27.460 --> 33:28.460
No, it's more traditional.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.460
Somebody should make that game on Facebook.

33:29.460 --> 33:35.060
Patent pending, patent pending, Loki, would you play a game like that for free?

33:35.060 --> 33:36.900
I think I, I check it out at least.

33:36.900 --> 33:41.620
I played, um, quake, um, I can't remember that quake live.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.580
I played that for a little bit when it first came out.

33:43.580 --> 33:46.860
I thought it was cool cause it was based off quake three, which was like the best fricking

33:46.860 --> 33:47.860
quake they ever did.

33:47.860 --> 33:50.140
In fact, somebody in chat agrees with me.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.140
Uh, let's see.

33:51.140 --> 33:52.140
Who is it?

33:52.140 --> 33:53.140
Ah, yes.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.140
Zen thralls.

33:54.140 --> 33:55.140
Zen says quake three arena.

33:55.140 --> 33:56.140
Best land party game ever.

33:56.140 --> 33:57.140
Period.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.580
I was, it was one of the best, uh, over the internet games too.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.100
Oh, it was a lot of fun to play.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.500
I had a good time with that one.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.700
We'll see how this Facebook game goes, but I'm telling you guys this.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.740
This is the direction gaming's moving.

34:08.740 --> 34:12.820
Facebook as a platform for, for gaming.

34:12.820 --> 34:17.620
Pretty soon you're going to be talking Xbox 360, Wii, PS3, PC, and Facebook gaming.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.620
Oh, and iPhones.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.060
You got to throw that in there too.

34:20.060 --> 34:24.900
Facebook is like a serious platform for gaming.

34:24.900 --> 34:25.900
Believe it or not.

34:25.900 --> 34:29.900
Uh, one thing to take very seriously as a lot of people do is world of Warcraft and

34:29.900 --> 34:32.820
some people take the auction house dealings very seriously.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.220
In fact, some people kind of play the economy.

34:35.220 --> 34:37.140
It's like the game.

34:37.140 --> 34:40.260
Like I don't really, I don't really get into the whole auction house dealings, so I'm not

34:40.260 --> 34:43.420
sure exactly what they do, but I guess it's kind of like the stock stock market.

34:43.420 --> 34:48.120
You buy items that are plentiful and then when they're not available, you sell them

34:48.120 --> 34:50.460
at a high profit is basically what it is.

34:50.460 --> 34:53.940
Well, people that play world of Warcraft for the auctions and for the markets are in for

34:53.940 --> 34:56.620
a big surprise because guess what?

34:56.620 --> 35:01.060
Apparently Blizzard has announced this week that soon you are going to be able to manage

35:01.060 --> 35:08.540
your auctions from world of Warcraft using the armory application on the iPhone or iPod

35:08.540 --> 35:10.280
touch.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.580
We don't know much about exactly how this will work yet.

35:12.580 --> 35:14.060
You know, we don't know the specifics.

35:14.060 --> 35:16.780
Like can you access your in game mail too?

35:16.780 --> 35:19.940
Because that's the only way you get the money from your auctions or you know, how would

35:19.940 --> 35:23.260
you post something if you can't access your character's bags or what have you.

35:23.260 --> 35:24.960
We don't know the answer to all the specifics yet.

35:24.960 --> 35:28.800
We just know that Blizzard is throwing out that idea of you could play the economical

35:28.800 --> 35:31.140
game of world of Warcraft on the go.

35:31.140 --> 35:32.140
Interesting.

35:32.140 --> 35:36.860
But of course, one thing they are saying with this as well is that it will cost money.

35:36.860 --> 35:39.660
It's going to be a premium based service.

35:39.660 --> 35:43.200
They've said premium based, which you know that means cost money.

35:43.200 --> 35:47.500
Don't know if that'll be a monthly thing that you add on for your character or what I would

35:47.500 --> 35:51.460
assume would be the option would be you charge for the app on the iPhone.

35:51.460 --> 35:54.340
If you're going to be releasing this on the iPhone, you're going to charge $9.99 for the

35:54.340 --> 35:56.160
app or something like that.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.180
That's how they will make their money.

35:58.180 --> 36:02.060
Dark Sakura, I know you're not a big WoW player anymore, but let's say they had an equivalent

36:02.060 --> 36:04.860
in Star Trek online, or let's imagine you did still play WoW.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.020
Do you think this is the kind of thing you'd be interested in?

36:07.020 --> 36:09.120
As long as it's free.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.120
But it's not.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.620
So you wouldn't pay a premium for it?

36:11.620 --> 36:13.620
No, I wouldn't.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.620
Why do you think someone would-

36:14.620 --> 36:18.720
Then again, this is the person who just bought, you know, a thousand cryptic points.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.500
Why do you think someone would be into this?

36:20.500 --> 36:23.700
Why do you think someone would say, hey, because I'm looking at this going, you know, as awesome

36:23.700 --> 36:28.220
as this feature sounds, and depending on the cost, I might just, like if it is just like

36:28.220 --> 36:31.660
five bucks for the app, I might just buy it to check it out.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.580
I don't see myself really using it.

36:33.580 --> 36:36.180
Like it's kind of weird to be using that on the phone.

36:36.180 --> 36:42.300
I was trying to look at the page for, you know, what the interface and everything.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.420
Well, they don't have that yet.

36:43.420 --> 36:45.660
It's all they've said now is an announcement.

36:45.660 --> 36:50.980
I used the armory itself, but I don't know.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.860
I'm not that obsessed about the games I play.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.580
I mean, really, it's something for addicts.

36:55.580 --> 37:00.740
Loki, I know you're not a big MMO player anymore, but let's assume this was five years ago and

37:00.740 --> 37:03.100
this is a Final Fantasy XI Auction House app.

37:03.100 --> 37:04.100
What do you think?

37:04.100 --> 37:07.500
Well, it's an app for an iPhone or something like that, right?

37:07.500 --> 37:10.940
Well, yeah, but let's say it was something you could access on the web too or something.

37:10.940 --> 37:11.940
I don't know.

37:11.940 --> 37:12.940
No.

37:12.940 --> 37:13.940
No?

37:13.940 --> 37:14.940
Not for you?

37:14.940 --> 37:15.940
Not for me.

37:15.940 --> 37:16.940
That's why I go into game.

37:16.940 --> 37:17.940
Good point.

37:17.940 --> 37:22.580
I have to admit, although I might be willing to just kind of check it out if, you know,

37:22.580 --> 37:26.740
just for the sake of checking it out, I don't know if I'd want to pay a monthly fee just

37:26.740 --> 37:27.740
to manage my auctions.

37:27.740 --> 37:29.220
I mean, that's kind of what.

37:29.220 --> 37:34.260
And the other thing that kind of worries me, this is like my one little weird worry and

37:34.260 --> 37:37.900
I don't know, maybe the chatters can tell me if I'm being irrational with this, but

37:37.900 --> 37:42.460
I kind of always thought this was how a lot of the gold farmers made their money.

37:42.460 --> 37:48.780
So by kind of allowing folks to do this without being actually in the game, could you possibly

37:48.780 --> 37:52.720
be encouraging the gold farming community and the people that are hacking and stealing

37:52.720 --> 37:54.080
accounts?

37:54.080 --> 37:58.860
Is that an irrational line of thought or do I have a legitimate concern there?

37:58.860 --> 38:00.460
I don't know.

38:00.460 --> 38:01.460
You tell me.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.460
Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

38:02.460 --> 38:05.840
We'll get to some of that feedback in just a moment, but we'll move on with the news

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
for now.

38:07.840 --> 38:15.220
Now, you remember when we were talking about Akira Yamaoka leaving Konami?

38:15.220 --> 38:24.740
Well, we know where he ended up, is with Grasshopper Manufacture and is supposed to be doing music

38:24.740 --> 38:32.220
for an upcoming horror game that they're doing that's produced by Shinji Mikami.

38:32.220 --> 38:40.140
So maybe it's going to be going back to more of a game that has the feel of the older Silent

38:40.140 --> 38:46.100
Hill, you know, not necessarily the kind of Americanized ones now, you know what I mean?

38:46.100 --> 38:51.900
But just if it puts anything in perspective, Grasshopper did Fatal Frame 4 and No More

38:51.900 --> 38:52.900
Heroes 2.

38:52.900 --> 38:58.220
Do you know that they have the translation project for Fatal Frame 4?

38:58.220 --> 38:59.220
Yeah, it's really good.

38:59.220 --> 39:02.580
Yeah, I think we covered that a few weeks ago, probably about a month ago on the show.

39:02.580 --> 39:03.580
Yeah, I remember that.

39:03.580 --> 39:04.580
So I think that's pretty cool.

39:04.580 --> 39:11.820
If that's the kind of game he's going to work on, then perhaps it's a worthy thing that

39:11.820 --> 39:13.820
he's jumped ship.

39:13.820 --> 39:18.700
I don't know where I read this, and it's probably just one of those fan wank rumors, I don't

39:18.700 --> 39:21.980
know, but I had heard that EA was courting Akira Yamaoka.

39:21.980 --> 39:25.620
Well, EA is producing the game that Grasshopper's working on.

39:25.620 --> 39:26.620
I see.

39:26.620 --> 39:30.060
Maybe that's, maybe it was kind of jumping to conclusions type of thing.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.060
Possibly.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.060
That could be.

39:32.060 --> 39:38.140
Probably to Akira Yamaoka getting to do whatever Silent Hilly horror game I'm sure EA would

39:38.140 --> 39:39.460
be more than happy to publish.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.780
Oh, I wouldn't doubt that at all.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.780
Yeah.

39:42.780 --> 39:43.780
Interesting.

39:43.780 --> 39:47.580
I mean, that man is pretty much Silent Hill.

39:47.580 --> 39:52.620
Going back to the chat room, chat.orangelandradiocomm and some of the comments from the auction

39:52.620 --> 39:57.520
app for WoW, SSJ100 Matt in our chat room says, I bet there will be an auction house

39:57.520 --> 39:59.820
app for Final Fantasy XIV.

39:59.820 --> 40:04.820
You know, it will be interesting to see how Squeenix kind of embraces all this stuff that

40:04.820 --> 40:05.900
WoW is doing.

40:05.900 --> 40:11.460
They, they, I noticed for Eleven, especially towards the end, they tried to do some very

40:11.460 --> 40:16.680
minor armory-ish stuff, like you could access link shell lists in game and basic character

40:16.680 --> 40:20.620
information on the web, but the armory is really robust now, like you can even get like

40:20.620 --> 40:24.920
pictures of your characters in the armory, like as they appear in game, like it renders

40:24.920 --> 40:25.920
them.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
Oh yeah, I thought it was cool.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.100
And you can pose them in different poses, so when other people look at it, they'll see

40:29.100 --> 40:30.100
it, which I think is kind of cool.

40:30.100 --> 40:31.740
Like I have one of my characters blowing a kiss.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
It's really cheesy.

40:32.740 --> 40:37.860
Let's see, other comments from chat room, xlink says, I'm not buying it.

40:37.860 --> 40:41.680
And it also says that he thought of the same thing that I was mentioning with the gold

40:41.680 --> 40:46.140
farmers and that's why he's not using it.

40:46.140 --> 40:50.860
Also was a quick shout out there from hitstun, does Dissida have any Final Fantasy XI characters?

40:50.860 --> 40:55.580
SSJ100 Matt clarifying, yes, there's a quick cameo of a Final Fantasy XI character.

40:55.580 --> 41:01.820
Final Fantasy XI is tricky to do because there was no standard hero.

41:01.820 --> 41:05.820
You were the hero and you could look a variety of different ways, you know, because you could

41:05.820 --> 41:07.060
customize your character.

41:07.060 --> 41:10.180
Although everyone had the same outfit over and over and over and over.

41:10.180 --> 41:11.180
For real.

41:11.180 --> 41:12.180
I mean the customization was very limited.

41:12.180 --> 41:15.900
I did like, so seeing the male characters walking around in their leather mantis.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.820
Yes, yes, there was always the, what were they called?

41:18.820 --> 41:24.220
The bronze, or whatever, yeah, it looked like mantis, basically, who was running around

41:24.220 --> 41:25.700
and it was really funny.

41:25.700 --> 41:28.380
With a harness.

41:28.380 --> 41:29.380
Yes.

41:29.380 --> 41:35.100
Let's, let's, but some of like maybe the boss characters and some of the NPCs that you interact

41:35.100 --> 41:36.100
with I could see being in the game.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.100
I think that's what they were talking about.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.100
I'm sure it is too.

41:38.100 --> 41:41.500
As SSJ100 Matt clarifies, it's a Taru Taru, which...

41:41.500 --> 41:42.980
It's one of the characters that's in the game.

41:42.980 --> 41:46.200
Doesn't surprise me at all because Taru Taru is what everybody remembers.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.820
And even in Final Fantasy XIV, they're going to have Taru Tarus, but they're not calling

41:49.820 --> 41:53.580
them Taru Tarus, which is so weird to me, but...

41:53.580 --> 41:54.580
It is absolutely retarded.

41:54.580 --> 41:58.540
Whatever, hey, hey, whatever, as long as the game is good, I don't care.

41:58.540 --> 42:01.500
Call them Sexy Chocolate for all I care.

42:01.500 --> 42:02.500
Sexy Chocolate?

42:02.500 --> 42:03.500
That's awesome.

42:03.500 --> 42:10.220
I'm going to roll a Sexy Chocolate White Mage.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.300
Where did I even get that?

42:11.300 --> 42:12.300
I don't know.

42:12.300 --> 42:13.300
Alright.

42:13.300 --> 42:14.300
I have no idea.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.300
You know what's funny?

42:15.300 --> 42:16.860
You made me think about wrestling for the first time in a long time.

42:16.860 --> 42:18.980
By talking about Sexy Chocolate White Mage?

42:18.980 --> 42:27.260
There was a guy on there whose character's nickname was Sexual Chocolate.

42:27.260 --> 42:31.660
That should be the name of a video game band.

42:31.660 --> 42:32.660
Sexy Chocolate White Mage.

42:32.660 --> 42:36.860
I don't know how that works, but...

42:36.860 --> 42:39.300
Oh god, we need to do some release dates.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.300
Goober!

42:40.300 --> 42:41.300
Quick, please change the topic.

42:41.300 --> 42:42.300
Help.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.300
Okay.

42:43.300 --> 42:47.080
Well, this isn't anything to do with Sexy Chocolate, but I guess since next week is

42:47.080 --> 42:53.060
Valentine's week, and I guess it could be Sexy Chocolate, if you're into that kind of

42:53.060 --> 43:00.060
thing for Dante's Inferno, because nothing says Sexy Chocolate like tortured souls and

43:00.060 --> 43:08.120
hell, of course that'll be out on Playstation 3 as the Divine Edition, because it's divinely

43:08.120 --> 43:15.020
packed with extras, and the regular edition on Xbox 360.

43:15.020 --> 43:21.500
And then of course, also that week there will be Star Ocean Last Hope International Edition,

43:21.500 --> 43:26.220
which is on Playstation 3, basically the port of the game that came out on Xbox 360 last

43:26.220 --> 43:27.220
year.

43:27.220 --> 43:33.980
Family Party 30 Great Games Winter Fun, yet another party game compilation for the Wii.

43:33.980 --> 43:38.260
World Cup of Pool coming to the DS.

43:38.260 --> 43:42.180
Sheeran the Wanderer coming to the Wii, which looks pretty awesome.

43:42.180 --> 43:43.660
That's from Atlus.

43:43.660 --> 43:50.900
And of course, the big one for the week, BioShock 2, making its way out on PC, Playstation 3,

43:50.900 --> 43:52.860
and Xbox 360.

43:52.860 --> 43:58.260
Or if you're a teenage girl, perhaps Seen at Twilight is the big game for you this week.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.540
That will be out on the DS.

44:00.540 --> 44:07.700
And if you want none of those, or just own a Wii, then perhaps Super Monkey Ball Step

44:07.700 --> 44:09.580
and Roll will be your type of game.

44:09.580 --> 44:12.020
And that's coming out just on the Wii.

44:12.020 --> 44:15.260
Low-key, you know how much it would amuse me, especially for the YouTube channel, if

44:15.260 --> 44:19.500
we were to follow you with a camera, to one of those midnight releases for Dante's Inferno

44:19.500 --> 44:22.120
or BioShock 2, because they're both coming out at the same time, right?

44:22.120 --> 44:25.420
And then you walk up to the counter and ask for Seen at Twilight.

44:25.420 --> 44:26.420
I would love that.

44:26.420 --> 44:29.100
Except I wouldn't want to do that.

44:29.100 --> 44:32.800
By the way, the reason why that's called the Divine Edition is because the Inferno was

44:32.800 --> 44:40.060
part of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri, so that's why it's called the Divine Version.

44:40.060 --> 44:45.020
Which, I've read that in fifth grade.

44:45.020 --> 44:49.660
I thought it was called the Divine Edition because it's like, you know, Sony's way of

44:49.660 --> 44:51.940
saying, hey look, we have something exclusive!

44:51.940 --> 44:52.940
Ah!

44:52.940 --> 44:59.940
We may have lost Final Fantasy 13, and, you know, Residence of Fate, and all the other

44:59.940 --> 45:02.620
games have come out, but hey, we've still got the Divine Edition!

45:02.620 --> 45:05.660
You're not going to be able to get that download content until later.

45:05.660 --> 45:08.540
They're just trying to be all literary and cultured and shit.

45:08.540 --> 45:12.340
I thought they called it the Divine Edition because the Sexy Chocolate Edition just got

45:12.340 --> 45:15.500
rejected, is what it was.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.500
Fail.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.500
Alright.

45:17.500 --> 45:18.500
Hey!

45:18.500 --> 45:20.500
Some other release dates for Japan.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.540
Game coming out on the Xbox 360 this week.

45:22.540 --> 45:27.740
Sacred 2 Fallen Angel makes its way to Japan this week, and I'm trying to see what kind

45:27.740 --> 45:28.880
of game this is.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
This is a...

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
It's a role-playing game.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.780
Well, okay, I can see that, but I'm trying to figure out what more about this.

45:33.780 --> 45:36.820
Is this like a Final Fantasy-ish kind of game?

45:36.820 --> 45:39.540
The graphics look interesting, kind of like in a desert.

45:39.540 --> 45:40.940
It came out here last year.

45:40.940 --> 45:41.940
It sucked.

45:41.940 --> 45:42.940
Alright.

45:42.940 --> 45:45.940
Oh, there's like a not-chocobo in the game there that you can ride.

45:45.940 --> 45:47.500
They don't localize this for the US, though, right?

45:47.500 --> 45:48.500
It's a boca-cho!

45:48.500 --> 45:49.500
Yeah!

45:49.500 --> 45:53.320
One of the reviews, though, I'm reading online, this game is massive.

45:53.320 --> 45:55.540
There's tons of quests, and the level cap is 200.

45:55.540 --> 45:56.540
Who knows, though?

45:56.540 --> 45:58.340
That was probably written by the publisher.

45:58.340 --> 46:02.180
If you don't want to play that on the Xbox 360, you could check it out on PlayStation

46:02.180 --> 46:06.140
3, because it's coming out there, too, as well as a game called Winter Sports 2010 The

46:06.140 --> 46:07.700
Great Tournament.

46:07.700 --> 46:12.260
I'm assuming that's like coming from a company who didn't get the Olympic license, but wants

46:12.260 --> 46:14.180
to cash in on it anyway.

46:14.180 --> 46:16.320
So there you go.

46:16.320 --> 46:21.020
If you want, you could check out on the Nintendo Wii, Madworld makes its way for Japan this

46:21.020 --> 46:22.020
week.

46:22.020 --> 46:26.520
That is a Japanese localized release on the Nintendo Wii this week, coming from Sega.

46:26.520 --> 46:30.260
And unfortunately, a lot of folks passed here, but maybe if it does very well in Japan, there'll

46:30.260 --> 46:31.260
still be a sequel.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.900
So you might want to consider picking that up.

46:32.900 --> 46:40.420
On the Nintendo DS this week, Mina no Conveni comes out this week, and it is a strategy-based

46:40.420 --> 46:45.280
game, but when I say that, it looks like a little girl going cooking.

46:45.280 --> 46:51.460
It's not cooking mama, but kind of like cafeteria managing, maybe kind of a version of Diner

46:51.460 --> 46:52.460
Dash, I don't know.

46:52.460 --> 46:55.440
Kind of what it strikes me as from the pictures I see there.

46:55.440 --> 47:01.060
Quickly taking a look at the PSP, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade gets a price reduction.

47:01.060 --> 47:04.460
That game is already out, but it's getting a little price cut this week.

47:04.460 --> 47:06.740
It's Dynasty Warriors Strike Force.

47:06.740 --> 47:09.100
That's what you might know the game better as.

47:09.100 --> 47:11.740
Those are your Japanese release dates.

47:11.740 --> 47:14.580
Dark Sakura, what's going on overseas in the UK the other way?

47:14.580 --> 47:17.700
Well for the UK, we've got a few goodies.

47:17.700 --> 47:22.060
We have Bioshock 2 on the 9th, and on the 10th, Darwinia.

47:22.060 --> 47:26.780
And the 12th is Bleach the Third Phantom, Half Minute Hero, Phantasy Star Zero, Star

47:26.780 --> 47:31.740
Ocean, The Last Hope, and Super Monkey Ball Step and Roll.

47:31.740 --> 47:36.800
Alrighty, cool.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.860
So this is kind of interesting.

47:38.860 --> 47:45.500
Apparently there is a developer resume that's hinting at an Xbox 360 version of Final Fantasy

47:45.500 --> 47:47.140
14.

47:47.140 --> 47:57.940
And apparently also this was being removed a few hours later, and apparently this profile

47:57.940 --> 48:05.900
that was on a website linked in for designer Yuki Akama referenced work on Final Fantasy

48:05.900 --> 48:09.460
14 for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

48:09.460 --> 48:16.140
Of course, only the PC and PS3 platforms have been officially confirmed to be coming out.

48:16.140 --> 48:20.140
And not only that, but Sony took great pride in last year's E3 at saying, you can only

48:20.140 --> 48:22.840
play this on the PlayStation 3.

48:22.840 --> 48:26.940
And leading many folks to question if the Xbox Live hurdle proved to be too much for

48:26.940 --> 48:30.740
Squeenix to deal with, although I'm sure Microsoft doesn't want to lose that.

48:30.740 --> 48:36.500
I'm sure we'll hear whether it's coming out on the 360 or not.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.940
Earlier this week I thought it was.

48:37.940 --> 48:40.820
Now you ever use the website linked in, Matt?

48:40.820 --> 48:41.820
No.

48:41.820 --> 48:45.740
It's kind of like a professional Facebook, I think is the best way I can describe it.

48:45.740 --> 48:49.960
I have a profile on there, and basically it's kind of like a place where you can post your

48:49.960 --> 48:55.260
resume and do job searches, but it's supposed to be a way to professionally connect with

48:55.260 --> 48:59.300
your coworkers and people they know and so forth.

48:59.300 --> 49:02.620
It's more of like a professional linked in, and there are quite a few of the gaming community

49:02.620 --> 49:03.620
uses that.

49:03.620 --> 49:07.740
I've connected with quite a few other podcast hosts and so forth on linked in.

49:07.740 --> 49:11.380
I'm sure it will come out on 360, it only makes sense.

49:11.380 --> 49:15.900
More people that they can get on the service, the better it is for them, so I don't see

49:15.900 --> 49:17.100
why they wouldn't.

49:17.100 --> 49:22.060
It just seems weird to me that Sony was so excited about it, and then just to lose this

49:22.060 --> 49:27.460
again, you know, because this would be twice in a row with the whole Final Fantasy 13 thing

49:27.460 --> 49:28.460
going to Xbox.

49:28.460 --> 49:32.340
That's going to be a blow to the ego.

49:32.340 --> 49:33.340
We'll see.

49:33.340 --> 49:40.100
Like I said, earlier this week there were reasons for me to believe that there might

49:40.100 --> 49:49.340
be a 360 version, but then those were soonly changed just by what I think, I don't know,

49:49.340 --> 49:53.260
my own opinion, if I could be vaguer than that.

49:53.260 --> 49:58.380
I think a version on the 360 could be eventually, but it would seem like that might come out

49:58.380 --> 49:59.380
later.

49:59.380 --> 50:04.720
And here's the other thing, Squeenix doesn't seem to think that Final Fantasy will do well

50:04.720 --> 50:05.980
on 360 in Japan.

50:05.980 --> 50:10.580
Keep in mind, Final Fantasy 13, not happening on the 360 in Japan, or hasn't happened yet

50:10.580 --> 50:13.060
because the game's already out there.

50:13.060 --> 50:16.820
Maybe the same type of thing is happening where they're going to release Final Fantasy

50:16.820 --> 50:23.700
14 on the 360 here in America and only here in maybe Europe too.

50:23.700 --> 50:29.820
But maybe they don't want to hold up the debut of the game to make the 360 version.

50:29.820 --> 50:30.820
Does that make sense?

50:30.820 --> 50:32.980
Because they're going to do a worldwide launch this time.

50:32.980 --> 50:37.020
You know, 11 took like a year to get localized over here, but maybe Final Fantasy 14, they're

50:37.020 --> 50:39.020
going to throw it out there all at once.

50:39.020 --> 50:41.060
Japan, US, and Europe.

50:41.060 --> 50:43.740
Everybody gets it at once, and there'll be a 360 version someday.

50:43.740 --> 50:47.620
Would it be hilarious if it became a 360 exclusive?

50:47.620 --> 50:48.620
No way.

50:48.620 --> 50:49.620
No way.

50:49.620 --> 50:50.740
It would be hilarious though.

50:50.740 --> 50:57.520
Just considering how, you know, Final Fantasy 11 was really created as a PS2 game.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.140
It was really made for the PlayStation 2.

50:59.140 --> 51:04.580
I know a lot of us here in the States played it on the PC, but part of the reason that

51:04.580 --> 51:10.340
game was so limited and finally outgrew itself and couldn't expand the way that WoW has continued

51:10.340 --> 51:13.840
to expand is because it's limited to the PS2.

51:13.840 --> 51:19.060
And that's why Final Fantasy 11 is kind of, they're not going to really support that as

51:19.060 --> 51:20.060
much anymore.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.060
I'm sure it will always be alive.

51:21.060 --> 51:24.820
There will always be people playing Final Fantasy 11, but it's going to downsize big

51:24.820 --> 51:28.900
time when 14 comes out.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.140
And we'll see what happens.

51:30.140 --> 51:31.540
All right.

51:31.540 --> 51:34.940
One other story for you guys here, and then we're going to get to the classic game of

51:34.940 --> 51:35.940
the week.

51:35.940 --> 51:38.900
And this has to do with some rumors, and this is a big fat rumor.

51:38.900 --> 51:43.060
And this is also one of the rumors, I don't know, it seems kind of useless to talk about

51:43.060 --> 51:46.260
this on the show, but I thought I'd throw it out there because it is circulating around

51:46.260 --> 51:47.260
some blogs.

51:47.260 --> 51:53.480
But apparently there is a rumor going around that a quote, new Nintendo platform is going

51:53.480 --> 51:56.940
to be announced at the game developers conference.

51:56.940 --> 52:03.040
And that's in a story that was run by the website video gamer.com from an industry source,

52:03.040 --> 52:08.140
an employee at a major international publisher, obviously anonymous, as you can imagine, quote,

52:08.140 --> 52:12.860
just heard a rumor that you may be interested in Nintendo are going to announce a new platform

52:12.860 --> 52:14.320
at GDC.

52:14.320 --> 52:17.420
Some devs have already started work on it.

52:17.420 --> 52:21.060
So we don't know if that could be a redone handheld.

52:21.060 --> 52:26.700
I mean, I think we've already heard rumblings of a DS2, even though there's the Excel

52:26.700 --> 52:30.780
still has yet to come out here in the US, we've heard rumblings of a DS2.

52:30.780 --> 52:34.940
Some fanboys are hoping it's finally the Wii HD already.

52:34.940 --> 52:35.940
Who knows what it could be?

52:35.940 --> 52:38.540
Could it maybe be an enhancement to the existing Wii?

52:38.540 --> 52:43.580
Like I don't want to joke the vitality sensor, but something in that vein?

52:43.580 --> 52:44.620
Probably nothing like that.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.340
I don't know if they would do another Wii.

52:46.340 --> 52:49.460
I mean, because it's selling like hotcakes right now.

52:49.460 --> 52:54.260
What would be the point, you know, in trying to put some now I'd see maybe another handheld

52:54.260 --> 52:58.700
system because maybe that's starting to slow down a little bit, but I doubt they would

52:58.700 --> 52:59.700
be doing a Wii.

52:59.700 --> 53:06.540
They're going to build one that you implant into your brain so you can just play until

53:06.540 --> 53:07.740
you have seizures.

53:07.740 --> 53:11.420
Unless they're trying to stay ahead, they're worried that maybe once these other motion

53:11.420 --> 53:18.660
controllers come out for Microsoft and PlayStation 3 and Sony, that you're going to have kind

53:18.660 --> 53:23.620
of an even playing field and then they're going to just fail based on the quality of

53:23.620 --> 53:27.300
their product because now you're going to have these really pretty looking games that

53:27.300 --> 53:32.220
control just like they do on the Wii and people are going to be more apt to maybe buying those,

53:32.220 --> 53:37.820
which I don't think that's true, but maybe they're just trying to stay one step ahead.

53:37.820 --> 53:44.120
So I don't know, either way, I'm not too excited about it.

53:44.120 --> 53:48.660
In our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com, MaginamiCon, I hope I said that right, says

53:48.660 --> 53:49.660
what?

53:49.660 --> 53:50.780
A phone?

53:50.780 --> 53:51.780
The end phone?

53:51.780 --> 53:53.500
Could that happen?

53:53.500 --> 53:59.100
I somehow doubt that, but that would be an interesting idea, sure.

53:59.100 --> 54:02.860
Interesting too, I kind of want to say if this is true, I don't think it's true.

54:02.860 --> 54:06.900
I think some things might happen behind closed doors at Game Developers Conference, but I

54:06.900 --> 54:09.860
don't think you're going to see the major announcement until E3.

54:09.860 --> 54:12.260
Game Developers Conference is not a media show.

54:12.260 --> 54:15.860
It doesn't strike me as the place to announce a new platform.

54:15.860 --> 54:20.980
The place to announce maybe a revision, I could see like a DSi XL or something there

54:20.980 --> 54:23.860
even though it's already out in Japan, but you know what I mean, like a slightly altered

54:23.860 --> 54:24.860
version.

54:24.860 --> 54:27.620
An enhancement or a new tool.

54:27.620 --> 54:32.020
Like I could see more Natal information coming out of GDC and some of the things that enhance

54:32.020 --> 54:37.380
gaming, but I don't see a full-on new platform being announced at Game Developers Conference.

54:37.380 --> 54:38.660
It's not a media show.

54:38.660 --> 54:40.660
It's for game developers.

54:40.660 --> 54:41.660
It's in the title.

54:41.660 --> 54:45.880
I know people think it's a media show and it's turning into one, but it's not supposed

54:45.880 --> 54:46.880
to be.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.260
It's really, really not, and I think a lot of people resent that it is.

54:49.260 --> 54:53.260
So I think if Nintendo is going to make an announcement, which I think it is the DS,

54:53.260 --> 54:59.100
I think the DS is going to get the revamp, you're going to see it at E3, not a Game Developers

54:59.100 --> 55:00.100
Conference.

55:00.100 --> 55:03.020
And yes, I know it is weird that I'm talking the DS revamp when we don't even have the

55:03.020 --> 55:08.540
XL here in the west, but I think Nintendo kind of knows that they could still put out

55:08.540 --> 55:12.060
the XL in limited quantities and it would sell if it was cheaper.

55:12.060 --> 55:17.900
It would still sell to the seven and eight year olds and the mothers that like to play

55:17.900 --> 55:22.860
Pokemon and whatever, the soccer moms, and whatever new DS system that will be $50 more

55:22.860 --> 55:28.340
expensive, maybe even $100 more expensive, will cater to the hardcore gamer who wants

55:28.340 --> 55:30.700
their Mario and Zelda games ASAP.

55:30.700 --> 55:31.700
Right?

55:31.700 --> 55:32.700
I don't know.

55:32.700 --> 55:33.700
Does that seem far-fetched to you guys?

55:33.700 --> 55:34.700
No.

55:34.700 --> 55:35.700
No.

55:35.700 --> 55:36.700
All right.

55:36.700 --> 55:37.700
Let's see.

55:37.700 --> 55:38.700
I'm sorry.

55:38.700 --> 55:42.220
I can't be too contrary about that.

55:42.220 --> 55:45.580
And some other comments in chat here, talking about MotionPlus, there's a couple of people

55:45.580 --> 55:47.580
bringing up MotionPlus.

55:47.580 --> 55:48.580
Was MotionPlus a flop?

55:48.580 --> 55:49.580
I don't know.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.840
That's a good question.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.020
Was MotionPlus a flop?

55:52.020 --> 55:54.640
What do you think, Loki, from your perspective in sales?

55:54.640 --> 55:59.340
Just that people, as far as rental stores and stuff go, they don't want to bring in

55:59.340 --> 56:02.420
games that have MotionPlus because they're afraid that people don't have it.

56:02.420 --> 56:04.300
It's kind of like the whole Guitar Hero thing.

56:04.300 --> 56:09.020
People don't want to bring it in because they're afraid that, oh, it requires this.

56:09.020 --> 56:11.520
It's not something that most people have.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.520
Is it a flop?

56:12.520 --> 56:16.580
I don't know if people are really all excited that, oh God, this game has MotionPlus now.

56:16.580 --> 56:17.580
It's going to be better.

56:17.580 --> 56:19.740
I don't really think it means anything yet.

56:19.740 --> 56:25.620
I mean, there's only been a few games that have actually used it, and I'm sure they're

56:25.620 --> 56:26.620
pretty good.

56:26.620 --> 56:31.540
It's just, it's not like game-changing or anything.

56:31.540 --> 56:33.960
Interesting comment from Blue Swim in our chat room.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.460
Interesting creative idea.

56:35.460 --> 56:39.460
Black Wii with groundbreaking DVD support.

56:39.460 --> 56:40.460
I don't know.

56:40.460 --> 56:41.460
I don't think anyone's going to care.

56:41.460 --> 56:45.740
I mean, most people are moving on to Blu-ray and stuff, and everything's a DVD player

56:45.740 --> 56:46.740
nowadays.

56:46.740 --> 56:50.700
Yeah, I think that's a creative outside-the-box answer for the topic at hand, but I just lean

56:50.700 --> 56:51.700
towards no.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.700
And I mean, seriously.

56:52.700 --> 56:53.700
I think Loki's right.

56:53.700 --> 56:54.700
Everything's a DVD player.

56:54.700 --> 56:55.700
DVD players are like 40 bucks, probably less than that.

56:55.700 --> 56:56.700
Wii's going to have Netflix.

56:56.700 --> 56:57.700
Yeah.

56:57.700 --> 57:00.060
It doesn't need a DVD player.

57:00.060 --> 57:06.540
It's a creative answer, but maybe a Wii revision was something else, but again, it's going

57:06.540 --> 57:07.800
to go the way of MotionPlus.

57:07.800 --> 57:11.560
The biggest problem with MotionPlus, it wasn't included with the console to begin with, so

57:11.560 --> 57:13.620
people are afraid not everyone has it.

57:13.620 --> 57:16.780
It's very hard to launch a peripheral.

57:16.780 --> 57:19.420
That's what Natal's uphill battle's going to be.

57:19.420 --> 57:24.660
That's why you read these articles and these rumors about the 360 is going to relaunch.

57:24.660 --> 57:29.380
It's not a new console per se, but they have to treat Natal like a relaunch of the damn

57:29.380 --> 57:30.380
system.

57:30.380 --> 57:34.140
There's ways they can really push the envelope with the Wii and make it very interesting,

57:34.140 --> 57:38.440
like using the whole head tracking and stuff like that, but they're just not doing it.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.700
They're not thinking outside the box.

57:39.700 --> 57:45.580
They don't need these extra add-ons like the Wii Vitality sensor, which is absolute shit.

57:45.580 --> 57:46.580
It's just going to be horrible.

57:46.580 --> 57:47.900
No one's going to buy it.

57:47.900 --> 57:50.900
It's just like the stupid pedometers for the DS.

57:50.900 --> 57:55.140
Yeah, there's going to be a few people like, oh good, I can exercise now.

57:55.140 --> 57:59.460
Yes, because you couldn't before.

57:59.460 --> 58:03.180
I don't understand why they need the add-on.

58:03.180 --> 58:06.700
The only thing I can think of is better graphics, maybe soup up the actual processor inside

58:06.700 --> 58:07.700
there.

58:07.700 --> 58:13.660
You know, because if they're hitting the limits of what they can do on that system, maybe

58:13.660 --> 58:14.660
that would help.

58:14.660 --> 58:20.980
But you know, like say the DSi for the Wii or something like that.

58:20.980 --> 58:25.780
But I'm afraid that whatever they do decide to put out is just going to be very gimmicky

58:25.780 --> 58:31.420
and stupid and it just gives them an excuse to put out another Mario game, another Metroid

58:31.420 --> 58:33.420
game, another Zelda game.

58:33.420 --> 58:35.860
And look, oh look, it's new, but it's not.

58:35.860 --> 58:36.860
I don't know.

58:36.860 --> 58:37.860
All right.

58:37.860 --> 58:40.540
Well, we're going to get into the classic game of the week here in just a moment and

58:40.540 --> 58:44.080
wrap up part A of our show, but I do want to say hello to all the folks who are tuning

58:44.080 --> 58:45.080
in live tonight.

58:45.080 --> 58:49.180
I guess the Super Bowl is over and so now we have some folks kind of coming back to

58:49.180 --> 58:50.620
us now that the football game is over.

58:50.620 --> 58:51.620
So welcome guys.

58:51.620 --> 58:52.620
Glad you could tune in tonight.

58:52.620 --> 58:55.500
I'm just going to recap quickly the things we have talked about tonight.

58:55.500 --> 58:59.560
Sorry to the podcast listeners, the folks that listen to us, it's the top of the show,

58:59.560 --> 59:01.380
but I want everyone to know what we've already covered.

59:01.380 --> 59:06.820
Sonic the Four episode one was already announced this week, was Project Needlemouse's other

59:06.820 --> 59:07.820
game.

59:07.820 --> 59:09.340
Blaster Master Overdrive has surprised us.

59:09.340 --> 59:11.460
It's going to be out on Monday.

59:11.460 --> 59:15.700
Xbox and Microsoft is ditching live support for the original Xbox.

59:15.700 --> 59:19.380
So Halo 2 fans are pissed, but the rest of us will gain a friends list of more than a

59:19.380 --> 59:20.940
hundred friends.

59:20.940 --> 59:24.580
Facebook is getting a new first person shooter game called Brave Arms.

59:24.580 --> 59:26.700
Facebook is a gaming platform, you betcha.

59:26.700 --> 59:32.100
Blizzard has been announcing teasing the idea of a premium auction house application for

59:32.100 --> 59:35.060
World of Warcraft so you can manage your auctions offline.

59:35.060 --> 59:38.540
Akira Yomoka has found a new home, he left Konami a couple months ago and now he's at

59:38.540 --> 59:41.900
Grasshopper working with the folks that did No More Heroes.

59:41.900 --> 59:47.540
We covered release dates, Final Fantasy XIV, a developer's LinkedIn profile has clued us

59:47.540 --> 59:52.420
into the fact that it could be under development for the 360, but we seem to come to a consensus

59:52.420 --> 59:56.580
that if it is under development for the 360, it probably won't come out at the same time.

59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.600
And then we just wrapped up talking about a story where Nintendo, big, big rumor could

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:06.180
be unveiling a new platform at GDC, but we all seem to think that that is not true.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:12.540
That it's probably some type of just kind of enhancement or new peripheral or some other,

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:17.140
you know, slight little addition because Game Developers Conference is not a media show.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.140
It's just not.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.140
All right.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.820
Now we're going to get into the classic video game of the week.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.780
It's a chance for us to take a trip down memory lane and go down gaming's history, and Dark

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.140
Sakura jumps into the vault and says, hey, ew, it's sticky.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.420
And here's a video game that you all should be playing.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.540
Dark Sakura, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.060
I was going to do this the other week and I decided that I was going to do it this week.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060
It's Qbert.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.060
Yeah.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.300
Qbert, where you play the little big nosed orange dude that has the, you know, curses

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.820
like a sailor and gets jumped on by snakes and little green snot looking things.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:01:00.340
Let's take a listen to Qbert and the awesome 1982 arcade noises.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:13.420
And he even got bonuses for the two discs on the side.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.420
Yep.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.660
I love the little sound that the disc makes.

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.100
Yeah, that's some cussing.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:24.380
Anyway, so Qbert was originally supposed to be a game about Qbert's big nose that could

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.380
shoot projectiles.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.860
And he would hop all over a pyramid that was actually made by Warren Davis.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.820
Instead, the shooting was taken out and he jumps and changes the colors on little platforms

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.020
on a pyramid.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:40.180
The original project name was called Cubes and was sort of called Snots and Boogers for

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180
a while.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.940
And then the little cussing thing that Qbert says when he gets hit.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.340
I love the high score board, by the way.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.340
Hi there!

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.700
In big letters.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.700
Hi there!

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.180
Welcome to the Nozer Elite!

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.980
Well, hello!

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:03.540
So yeah, it is basically sort of puzzle and hopping around and, you know, the game actually

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.420
gets really hard because, you know, your first few levels you only change it once and you've

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.540
got enemies all over the board.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.780
Also, then you move on to it changing to two colors.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.700
You have to change the entire board.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:21.980
And then it happens that you change to one color and if you hop back on it, it changes

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.980
back.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.020
And so you have to get them all to match the final new color.

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.820
And there's ones that change three times if you hop on them.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.380
And that's where the game just gets, like, disgustingly annoying.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.860
I was really good at this.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:39.840
I had the, actually, I had the Coleco version, Coleco Vision version for a long time, which

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840
I still have.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.700
I had the Commodore 64 version.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:49.580
Um, but your little enemies are called Coily, who's the purple snake, and Ugg and Wrongway,

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:55.580
these little purple snotty little creatures, and Slick and Sam that are the green boogers.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:02.420
And you can, you know, ride the little discs up to the top of the pyramid.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:07.540
And if you jump on the pyramid right, on the disc right when one of the enemies are chasing

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:12.620
you, or I should say Coily is chasing you, they'll hop off the edge behind you and die.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.940
Isn't that great, Rob?

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.940
Yes.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.580
That used to be how you'd have to do it.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:22.460
You'd have to kind of, like, lure them towards the disc and then kind of jump up there.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.380
It's kind of like what you were talking about last week during the Classic Game of the Week,

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.580
which was Link to the Past.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:30.940
How you'd have in those dungeons, the guards would charge at you, and if you were standing

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:34.260
towards the edge, then you'd just run real fast and they'd charge right off the edge

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.260
into oblivion.

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.260
It was great.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:41.980
Well, um, the other thing about this too, though, is that it was, um, produced by Gottlieb,

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:48.380
who does a lot of, who did, I should say, a lot of, uh, pinball tables too.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:58.660
Um, it also, um, the guy who developed it, uh, Warren Davis, sorry, um, was, uh, the

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:05.940
guy who was behind, um, Revolution X and Terminator 2 and a lot of fun, Joust 2 and Us vs. Them,

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.820
which is a laserdisc game.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:13.380
So he's been in, he was also on an episode of House MD, I didn't know that.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:18.500
Anyway, he's, you know, been around, you know, in the industry for a while and brought out

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.220
some pretty big classics.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.740
And then, um, it really is just a very simple little game, but it gets really hard.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.420
Um, as far as, uh, there were other games that came out.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:38.340
Um, for Qbert itself, it came out on the Odyssey 2, which I have that system as well.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:47.180
The Texas Instruments TI99, the, uh, Commodore VIC-20, um, Atari, the Atari systems, um,

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.860
the Atari 5200 version is ass, by the way.

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.860
Qbert was on everything from the 80s.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.860
Yeah.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.860
Everything.

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.860
Pretty much.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:05:01.020
Um, there was also, um, a sequel, an actual sequel called Qbert's Cubes, which, um...

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:02.020
Is not bad.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.020
I played it.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.020
It's kind of fun.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.020
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:08.500
Um, then there was Qbert III that came out on the NES, but it was very much like the

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.500
first one.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:14.340
And there was a Qbert pinball, of course, got, like, put out called Qbert's Quest.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:22.820
And, um, there was a tabletop electronic game version, um, all kinds of stuff.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:32.060
There's also, um, a version that, uh, was put out by Davis that, um, was called Faster,

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:37.300
Harder, More Challenging Qbert, and it's actually now out, um, while he didn't put it into production,

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300
is out for MAME.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.940
He released the, uh, ROM image.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940
Oh, wow.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940
Cool.

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.940
And, of course, there's, um, the, uh, updated Qbert that, um, uh, was on, um...

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:54.340
Crap, now I can't remember which of the, um, but it was, uh, um, a 3D Qbert, like a Qbert

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.340
remix or something.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.900
I think there was one on PlayStation, I want to say.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:58.900
I could be wrong.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:04.300
Yeah, there was, uh, the one on PS3, there was the 3D version of it, and it was supposed

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300
to be pretty good.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.300
Hmm.

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:11.020
You know, I liked Qbert and all, and I, I, I would like to see this come out on the Game

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:15.580
Room that Microsoft is doing, but I don't know if, if it will, because who owns the

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.660
rights to the Gottlieb games now?

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:20.620
Like, don't, doesn't a board game company own that, like, it doesn't, like, Hasbro

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.620
own them or something?

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.980
Is something really weird?

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.140
I don't know, but I'm wondering where this...

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:31.660
Like, I would think, though, free money, you know, like, hello, why don't you, uh, put

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:35.020
this game out on Game Room, but I don't know, it's gonna be weird.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:39.440
But I do hope if it does come out on Game Room, that you can control it with the buttons,

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.300
because you know with the D-pad it's gonna stink.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:47.100
In fact, on the Commodore 64 version, there was a mode where you could tilt your joystick

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:52.740
45 degrees, so that way you used up, down, left, and right to control.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:57.540
And then up went, like, actually to the upright, and you know, it, it, it, it made it a lot

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.180
easier to control on the Commodore 64, trust me, because trying to hit diag-diagonal directions,

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.740
can you imagine trying to hit diagonal directions on the Xbox 360 D-pad?

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.340
No thank you.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.540
Hopefully if it does come out in Game Room, you can use buttons for precision.

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.540
Hopefully.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.540
We'll see.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:13.540
But yeah.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.540
Oh, you know what else I remember, Rob?

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.540
What's that?

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.540
The Qbert cartoon, when I was a kid.

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.540
Mm-hmm.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.540
I had the Qbert board game.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.540
There was a board game.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:21.540
Yep.

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:25.940
I actually, somewhere, I had, I may not still have it, but I had a Qbert plushie.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:26.940
Very cute.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.940
With his big nose.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.060
All right, well that's gonna bring us to a close of part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.060
we are not done yet.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.140
We still have part B coming up after the break.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.500
We're gonna talk about a new console from Sega, but it's not what you think.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:44.300
We're gonna talk about a sequel to the Fallout series and some interesting developments over

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.300
at Harmonix.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.580
That's all coming up in part B. So those of you listening live, stay tuned.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.380
We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.260
Podcast listeners, you only have to wait a few seconds.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:08:02.980
So we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:08.020
Welcome back, everybody, to more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:14.220
episode number 354 for this February the 7th of 2010.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.140
It is Super Bowl Sunday here in the States, and I'm kind of, I don't really watch the

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.140
game.

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.140
I'm not really into football.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.140
The Super Bowl.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.660
But I know a lot of people watch it, so I know it was keeping people away from the show.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660
But now that it's over, you have no excuse.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.020
So hopefully, if you're listening live, you are here in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:35.260
And of course, if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, you should try and make

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.980
it for a live show sometime.

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.580
We will be here next Sunday.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:43.120
Next Sunday is Valentine's Day, which is also probably going to keep several people away.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.840
But the three of us have arranged plans with our significant others, so we will still be

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.260
able to be here for the Valentine's Day show.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.180
So look forward to that.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.940
Anyhow, or as some folks like to call it, Singles Awareness Day.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.500
So if you're single, come join the OLR family.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.660
We'll make you feel right at home here and talk about games or something.

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.300
Keep your mind off of what Hallmark wants you to think about all day long.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300
All right.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.900
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news, huh?

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.900
Yes.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:07.900
All right.

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.620
Let's do some quick, quick news stories.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.620
Loki.

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.620
Yes.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620
This is kind of cool.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.660
Now, there will be a Heavy Rain demo coming out on PlayStation 3 soon.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.860
It's not scheduled to come out until February 11th.

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:23.680
But if you can't wait that long, you can actually download it now.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.700
And the way you do this is participate in their alternate reality game.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.260
Now I know you probably don't have the time to do all that stuff.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.640
Thankfully if you go to Kotaku.com, they actually have a guide to walk you through picking up

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:41.340
the four pieces of evidence that you need to pick out in order to receive this demo.

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.980
So the clue and everything is all right there for you.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:52.480
Basically it just involves you signing up on Sony's site, heavyrainps3.com, and just

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.600
register there.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:00.900
And then go to the website precinct52.com.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:07.060
And then you can just look for the four pieces of evidence, which are the short cigarette

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:17.220
marked 11117B, the Origami Bird, Coffee Shop C, which you'll actually click on the one

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:23.760
that says Diner on it, and then the tire tracks, it's 117H.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.780
When you click on the tire tracks, it actually expands it out.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.780
Same with the cigarettes.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.700
You click on the picture of the cigarette and it'll be two different choices and choose

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700
117B.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:36.820
Once you've done all that, you'll receive a code to download the demo immediately, which

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.140
is better than waiting till the 11th.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.140
Other fun stuff.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.700
Coming to the PlayStation Network, Fret Nice, which was a game, it's kind of a side scroll

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:52.340
platformer game, that was actually a Flash game at one time that you played entirely

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.720
with the Guitar Hero Rock Band controller.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.140
Although for whatever reason, they decided to go with this really freakishly weird art

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.140
style.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.220
Personally, I like the Flash version better.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.140
But whatever, it will be available on PlayStation Network soon.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:15.780
And no date yet on the Xbox Live Arcade version, but soon.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.420
So PlayStation 3 is sweet though.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:25.340
And then finally, Rock Band is getting some new download content, including, well tonight

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:38.380
actually was the Who Super Bowl Smash Up Medley, and that was available for $2 or $2 in whatever

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.020
respective points you're spending.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:50.220
Also this week will be another album as well, including Holy Wars, The Punishment Due, which

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.780
is for also $2.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:12:03.780
Hangar 18, Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, Poison Was the Cure, Lucretia, Tornado of

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.940
Souls, Dawn Patrol, and Rust in Peace Polaris.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.780
All those are available for $2 as well.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.900
And that's of course off the Mega Death Hangar 18 album I believe.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.620
Or no, Rust in Peace, my mistake.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.620
Okay, well I've got some more news for you guys for some other types of games.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:26.900
Not music based, but definitely a popular game folks are looking forward to.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.620
ModNation Racers.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.660
As you know, this game is coming out on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.660
Do we have a time frame when that game's coming out?

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.660
Is that summer?

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.220
It got delayed again, so June as of right now.

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:39.420
Well apparently, not only is there going to be a PlayStation 3 version, there's going

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.460
to be a PSP version launching out.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:42.460
What?!

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.100
I know, I've never heard this news before.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.560
Totally new news!

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.020
But anyway, just so you know, this game does have all the same tools that you'll find in

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.220
the PS3 version, but of course the graphics are going to be scaled down a little bit.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:57.900
But you still get to make your own cars, your own racers, your own tracks, and you get to

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.980
share them with the PSP ModNation community.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.260
You get to go online with it and race and all that fun stuff.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:10.400
So PS3 and PSP versions launching side by side, very similar to LittleBigPlanet of course

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.340
also has the PS3 and PSP versions, but there was about a year break between the two.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:19.220
Don't expect to see that same large window between these two releases.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.940
Again, totally new news to me.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.660
I haven't heard this anywhere before.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:28.060
Hey, Civ Network is a popular anticipated Facebook game, at least at my house.

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.900
I'm really excited to play Civilization Network, but not going to get a chance to tell June.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.780
Yeah that's when the Civilization Network beta is apparently happening, is June.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:41.460
So yeah, Variety of all places is the one that made this report.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.620
Yeah Variety, the magazine usually talks about movies and TV, well they have to talk about

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.820
games too when there's big stuff going on.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.820
The beta for the new Facebook game, according to Variety, not starting until June.

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.980
By the way, this game was initially announced back in October, and that they were going

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:58.220
to do a beta tester hunt soon.

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.980
So soon means nine months.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.860
So yeah, it's like saying, you know, I'm going to have a baby soon.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.300
One other thing I got for you guys this week, a game lots and lots of people are talking

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:14.460
about, Mass Effect 2, is obviously a hugely popular title this week, and with good reason

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:18.820
from what I understand, I haven't played it myself, but I hear it's pretty fucking epic.

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:22.900
One thing though that is not epic is the size of the text, and if you're playing on a standard

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.780
television, you probably can't read it.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.420
It's got the tiny text problem.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.940
You know, you've heard about this in other games before, it's not just Mass Effect 2

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:31.940
that's had this problem.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.500
I want to say The Lost Planet had this, some other games too.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:39.660
And usually companies patch this problem so that you can actually read these on an SDTV.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:45.700
Well guess what, according to the project manager Michael Gamble, let's see, quote,

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.020
we understand that on some SDTVs, the smallest text in Mass Effect 2 can be difficult to

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020
read.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.060
While this was not an intentional result, it was a byproduct of the enhancements to

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.460
the user interface.

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:59.180
After investigating potential solutions, we have determined that while this issue does

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:03.980
affect a small portion of SDTV owners, we are unable to resolve it for Mass Effect 2

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.300
through a title update.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.940
So if you can't read the text on a small TV, it's time to buy a big TV.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.940
Dr. Zara.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:15.140
Well if you don't have a big TV, you should just get one anyway regardless.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:25.300
Well the PSP Go is apparently getting a relaunch, even though the PSP Go is kind of crap anyway.

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:30.060
But Gamervision is saying that they're definitely going to have a relaunch and that there's

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.060
going to be a price drop.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.540
So maybe that'll work, who knows?

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.500
I still think it's crap.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:47.300
Also, for our DDR fans, DDR Universe 3, DDS Revolution Universe 3 is on Xbox 360 games

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.300
on demand.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.680
So, get your $30 dollars ready if you want it.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.500
Or save your money, because it was my least favorite of the Xbox 360 games.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.340
And yeah, this is the thing that I actually bought a thousand cryptic points for.

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:07.420
Is that you can play a Ferengi or a Federation Klingon in Star Trek Online.

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:11.260
But it's like, you have to pay so much.

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.460
Okay, get this.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.900
You pay 240 cryptic points for a Klingon, right?

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.300
You pay 80 for a Ferengi.

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.300
80.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.380
What are they saying?

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:25.860
That maybe they just suck?

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.580
They should also have a character trait called greed, I think.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.980
Isn't that a little weird though, that you bought this game, yet they're making you pay

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:39.020
extra to roll these classes that probably a lot of people want to do?

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:40.980
No.

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:46.060
I suppose WoW charges you for certain types of faction changes and so forth, but I can't

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.400
think of anything that's locked out without having to spend more money, except I suppose

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.620
actual expansion packs themselves, I don't know.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.240
Well, the one thing that I want them to do is to make some of the pre-order special stuff

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.660
available for other people.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.660
And also for some reason, my liberated Borg isn't showing up.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.060
I haven't tried looking in the thing again, but I haven't been able to make a liberated

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.060
Borg for my bridge crew.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.060
Uh oh.

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:12.940
Maybe soon I need to find out where that is.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.180
But I mean, I'm just saying that the other thing too is that I bought more points so

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:19.220
I could buy a third character slot.

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.460
Are you only allowed two character slots?

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.460
Two character slots.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.620
Are there multiple servers or is it just one giant server?

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.620
One big giant server.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.620
Oh wow, that's kind of cool.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:30.660
The other thing is they were having, if you buy a lifetime membership, then you can have,

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.620
you start off with four slots, and you have the year when you get like one more extra

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:35.620
slot, I think.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:36.620
So I don't know.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.380
I didn't, I don't have the money for a lifetime, although I'd pay for it.

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.820
Question from our chat room, from Amaze Satsuma, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, do the female

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.220
Ferengi wear clothes?

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:49.460
Yes, they do, and there's an explanation for that, because keep in mind, all of our DS9

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.020
buddies out there, Rom's the Grand Nagus, and he brought in social reform.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.540
Let's go to Twitter topics.

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.780
Every week we invite you guys to send us your tweets.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:05.940
Show us your tweets at username O-L-R and submit your topics for possible consideration

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:06.940
to be read on the show.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:09.180
There's a few of them tonight, so I don't think we're going to read all of these, but

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.500
I'll read a few of these.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:18.260
From Pod Culture, Twitter topic, collector's editions of video games, yay or nay?

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.820
I say yay depending on what you're into.

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.980
Some of the extras can be cool sometimes.

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:28.320
It gets a little weird though when there's like really game changing items that are only

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.220
available in the collector's edition.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.060
I don't know, that's not cool to me.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.060
But I mean if it's a game I really like, sure I'm going to get the collector's edition.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.900
Like if there's a Final Fantasy 13 collector's edition, I'm probably buying it.

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.940
Logie, collector's editions, yay nay?

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.060
It all depends what's in it and how much it's for.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.900
I don't even have to ask Jamie, she's thumbing through her Star Trek collector's edition

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:48.900
right now.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:52.280
It came with an art book, it was cool, and a pen, and I get like all kinds of cool stuff

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.280
with it.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.100
So if it's something that I really like, if there's something that I really, really like,

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:03.820
and you know me and I love stuff, I will get the collector's edition.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.300
Going through some other tweets here, Alex Carson, interesting question.

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:11.300
I don't know if we're going to have much of an answer to this on Twitter.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.940
What podcast do you guys like to tune into?

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.140
Please tell me one of you guys like Stignation.

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:20.380
Here's the thing, and I don't know if Logie and Jamie feel similarly, but I don't listen

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.340
to a lot of other podcasts because I don't want to be inadvertently influenced by what

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.900
I hear on other shows.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.300
Like I'm all for you guys.

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.820
How John Tesh of you?

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.540
Well I'm all for you guys listening to independent shows and I think you should support other

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:37.720
independent radio, but I don't want to like hear something on one show and then like inadvertently

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.220
without knowing, copy it.

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.220
Does that make sense?

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.220
Yeah.

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.940
But I do support folks listening to other shows.

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:43.940
There are a few.

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:44.940
I've listened to more.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.140
I drive to the Bay Area more often now because you know I date somebody that lives in the

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.620
Bay Area and it's about a two hour drive.

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:52.340
I have used podcasts to fill the gap.

01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:54.860
Let me check with Dark Soccer and Logie though first before I answer.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.900
I do have a couple podcasts I like.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.380
Dark Soccer, Logie, anything?

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:05.880
I was listening to the Grammarcast for a while and there are a couple more like a few classic

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:12.620
gaming ones that I was listening to, but for the most part I actually don't really have

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:13.620
time.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.740
I should set them up to download on my iPhone, but I hardly ever forget to update my iPhone

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:18.740
anyway.

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:19.740
Logie?

01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:21.660
I don't really listen to other podcasts.

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.420
You can't at your work either because you're on the phone and stuff, right?

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.300
So I know a lot of people listen to some work to pass the time.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:36.820
No, it's not, I just don't because, I don't know, I just don't.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:44.340
I don't have time, well I probably have time during the day, but I just don't want to.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.620
Not that I don't think there's good stuff out there, it's just I don't listen to radio

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.620
either.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:54.860
I listen to my CD player, or I guess MP3 player right now that has like ten songs on it and

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:58.940
I loop them and I just don't care about adding new stuff to it.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:07.100
So same thing with podcasts, I read the news, there's no, for me I'd probably listen to

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:12.080
the game podcasts and I read the news and stuff, so I don't really need to hear the

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080
news again.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:20.020
Wait a minute, you just told people to basically not listen to this show.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.020
So be it, whatever.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.540
I'm just telling you why I don't listen to it.

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:28.080
We like to talk about all the news too, not just, I mean we try to report, usually we're

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.460
not the ones breaking the news, but we talk about it.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:39.140
There's absolutely no news breaking here other than, oh my god, ModNation Racers on PSP.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:42.540
Let's see, podcasts I listen to, you know, I haven't listened to Dignation, I try to

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.780
stay away from some of the corporate ones.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.220
I just think a lot of them aren't that great, although I will say there's an NPR podcast

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.540
that's kind of funny, the Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, it's like the game show-ish one that's

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.940
about the weekend news.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:55.660
It kind of depends on what week it is and who's on the panel, but some of those are

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:56.660
really funny.

01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:01.480
As far as video game podcasts go, I don't know how far I want to say this, like I have

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:05.380
tried listening to a corporate oriented podcast.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:10.940
It was a very niche thing and I kind of found myself a little bit bored listening to it.

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.660
It was kind of a niche gaming podcast.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:17.220
I kind of thought the hosts didn't have energy, like they didn't sound excited about what

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.220
they were talking about.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:22.140
It was kind of like, hello and welcome to our show, we're going to talk about this topic

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.140
today.

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:24.820
As hosted by Bob Ross?

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:31.540
Kind of, like I shouldn't say negative things, but I just, a lot of corp podcasts, like dude,

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:32.540
you're even paid to be there.

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.540
Well yeah, exactly.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:34.540
Be excited!

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:37.860
That and the corporate podcasts too, it's just like, hey, look at all these games that

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.420
the game publishers just dumped on our desk with gold and money.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.980
Look at all this shit I get to play for free!

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.940
They literally shoved money into my pockets and I was just like, oh, I hate this job,

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:48.220
it's so awful.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:52.580
To be fair, I know that gaming journalism is a very tough industry with very few jobs

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.480
and people work their asses off to stay in it, but at the same time, I found myself bored

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.660
listening to this particular podcast.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:02.820
It's just like when we used to go to like Konami press days and stuff like that and

01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:07.660
just the people there are, some of them are such douches.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.820
Anyhow, I'm not going to linger on the negative, let me move to the positive because there

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.020
are some indie podcasts I've listened to that I like.

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.420
Obviously I like Bobby's show, but clearly I'm biased and Friday Night Gaming I think

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:17.940
is a great show too.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.980
I actually listened to, and I really like the show, I've listened to it like three times

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:25.820
now on my drives to San Francisco, I like the Warcraft Outsiders.

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:29.340
It's the spinoff of Video Game Outsiders, which is a show kind of similar to us.

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:34.740
It's a girl and two guys who kind of drink and talk about the video game news, except

01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.740
they all do it on Skype.

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.300
I think one of them is in Canada and I think the others are on the East Coast somewhere,

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.220
but they do like a spinoff show about Warcraft and I think it's pretty good.

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.140
The girl leads it and she's like a hardcore Raider healer.

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:47.700
I think her and her boyfriend play a lot and I think they're pretty well informed of what

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:48.700
they're talking about.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:52.420
I think it has energy.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.740
They enjoy what they're talking about, although one guy on the show, kind of the running gag

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.900
is that he doesn't really play Warcraft so why is he there, but they make it funny so

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:01.900
it works.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:07.300
But they have energy, like when she talks about her rating and stuff, you can tell she

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:11.460
is having fun and she's doing a show about something she really likes and the guy too

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:13.340
and the guest host.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:18.300
For those that want my opinion on what makes a good podcast, have fun on what you're talking

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.540
about.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.460
Make people want to listen to you because you are excited and I try to have energy on

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.500
the show every week, even if I'm having a shit week.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:31.980
And don't forget, we've also got the comic podcast too that Mar and Marvel and I do.

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.420
And we giggle and are excited!

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420
So there you go.

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:43.780
Anyhow, let's see, let me move on to other comments on our Twitter.

01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.260
Spazinator says, latest rumor.

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:52.460
Patrick Stewart is said to be a huge fan of handheld gaming, specifically on the N-Gage.

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:53.460
Get it?

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:55.260
Oh my god, did I really just read that joke?

01:24:55.260 --> 01:25:00.420
See, let it not be said that we do not let every gamer have a voice, even when we should

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.740
probably throw tomatoes at them.

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.740
Waka waka waka.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.180
You know, the bad joke of the week wouldn't be a bad idea, you know, that would be kind

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.180
of funny.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.900
You get the OLR tomato award of the night, Spazinator, congratulations.

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.300
Here's one more Twitter question for you guys.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.300
Blue Swim asks us, any word on President Cat coming here?

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.300
Nope.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.540
PS Dark Sakura, I can have Mischief Makers as Classic Game of the Week?

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.700
Maybe.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.020
As far as President Cat goes, we didn't hear anything after the whole little, you know,

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:31.980
gauntlet of stuff that happened that week.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.700
I don't think it's happening.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:39.180
You know, there was the negative stories about that it only sold 100 copies, which I still

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:41.380
say were bullshit.

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:44.120
I failed to see how that was possible.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.020
Maybe 100 copies were imported to the US.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.220
There is no way it sold 100 copies, I'm sorry.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:56.100
I mean, even the crappiest of absolute shit that comes out on the Wii sells a lot of copies.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.900
That's why they release stuff on the Wii.

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:03.020
It's because people are like, hey, it's a game, it's cheap, let me buy it.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:09.140
You know, it could be, I don't know, it could be a game about working at a call center or

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.140
something.

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.140
Now, the Twitter account Rent a Wii has still been kind of making posts as of late, so they're

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:16.980
still kind of, you know, there, but I don't, I don't know.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.820
I think at this point, I'm not holding my breath to see it released over here, but you

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.820
know, don't give up.

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:26.500
Continue to follow it and send them tweets, and I think the best case scenario at this

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.960
point is that someone kind of caught wind of this whole thing going on, and maybe we'll

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.340
see a game like President Cat.

01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.700
But remember, there's a certain charm that President Cat had, and when you make a copy

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:43.180
of a copy, the quality declines, so just be very thoughtful in how you do that if you

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:48.460
are said publisher listening right now, thinking about cashing in on the President Cat craze.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:51.140
I think, again, it would sell.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.140
It would.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.340
Let's get back into some long-form gaming news.

01:26:56.340 --> 01:27:00.020
We'll read more of your tweets next week at Twitter.com slash O-L-R. The mailbag's coming

01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.020
up, though.

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.940
I know Dark Soccer's gonna tear into that in just a moment, but we do have some news

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.740
before we get there, Loki.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:05.740
Yes.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:11.600
You may remember that there was a, well, there's been a few knockoff Wii systems out there.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:19.340
One of them was Zone 40, which was just some, like, it looks sort of like a Wii, but not

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:24.460
quite, you know, and it had, you know, 40 little mini games.

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:31.700
Well, now, they have the officially licensed Sega Zone, which has 20 Genesis Classic games

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:39.840
and 30 new games, 16 of which are playable with the devices, two wireless motion controllers,

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:48.140
and yeah, and it's in the wonderful black and blue with the Sega logo on the side.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.860
Trying to see what games are in there.

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:52.260
It's kind of hard to see.

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.260
Oh, wait, here we go.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:54.260
Let me guess.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:55.260
Sonic the Hedgehog?

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.260
Well, Sonic the Hedgehog, yes.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.780
I mean, that's, you know, obvious.

01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:07.220
Looks like Alex Kidd, Sonic and Knuckles, Columns 3, Eswat, Echo the Dolphin, Golden

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.220
Axe.

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.100
Every Sega compilation, basically.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:16.620
Then, like, some of the other, like, arcade games that they have.

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.780
I think a lot of this is just some generic stuff, like, they have what looks like a boxing

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.780
game.

01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:22.780
Looks like Wii boxing or something.

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.140
I can actually see the little picture here.

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.660
I got a blown up version of it.

01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:31.900
Eswat, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe, Shinobi, and then in the Sega games section, they have

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.900
Canon.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:37.220
Well, no, that's the 14 arcade games section right below that.

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.780
Mr. Balls is one of them.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.780
Oh, oh, oh, I see.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:40.780
I see.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:47.060
Bomber, Canon, yeah, I see that's a bottle caps race or something.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:52.020
It's like they basically just, you know, copied over some of the, you know, crappy games that

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:56.020
were on there and put some Sega Genesis games on there.

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.540
And then some interactive sports games.

01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.540
Look at that.

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:03.060
It's like Wii Sports, but with 16 different games, including darts, I see, and, uh, interesting.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:04.060
Well it would-

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.060
Is that curling?

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:06.060
I believe it is.

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:12.980
It would all depend on what the price is and it says, um, I guess it's priced at, uh, $39.95,

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:18.300
uh, what is that, euros, I believe, so.

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.300
I don't know though.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300
I mean, it's-

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300
50 pounds.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:22.300
Cute, but-

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.300
50 pounds.

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:24.300
I think I'll pass on that.

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:29.500
Anyhow, um, I don't know how I feel about these games, but, uh, Wheel of Fortune and

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.860
Jeopardy, you know, these games, they're actually, I believe they're like Sony Pictures Entertainment,

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:40.660
um, game shows, but THQ has actually licensed the franchises to make video games based on

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:41.660
them.

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:44.540
I mean, it's not like it would be the first time ever a video game has been made out of

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.980
Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:51.540
But it would be awesome if they were, I don't know, uh, one of the Xbox, you know.

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.020
That's what I'm saying.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:56.340
That's where I was gonna go with this, is that, wouldn't that be cool if they actually,

01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:01.100
I mean, to make these games more fun, did the whole, like, 1 versus 100 route and made

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:03.020
them, like, a little more interactive like that?

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:09.100
Honestly, 1 versus 100 is awesome and everything, but it's starting to get old, and, um, you

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.420
know, I thought there was supposed to be more than just one game on there.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:18.260
And honestly, I've never played 1 versus 100 on, uh, you know, Xbox Live.

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.260
Just...

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:20.260
It's fun-ish.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:21.260
Dan likes it.

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:24.140
I was number one one night on Video Game Trivia, like, halfway through.

01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:28.740
I finally missed, I think I had a 26-question streak, and at one of the breaks, I was, like,

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:29.740
number one on the leaderboard.

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.300
I took a picture and posted it on Twitter and everything.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.180
I talked about it a few weeks ago on the show.

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.620
Um, but, sadly, yeah, I finally failed.

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:39.700
I think the question I failed on was, um, oh, I remember it was the ESRB rating.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.660
What was the ESRB rating for Worms 2?

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:42.660
I got it wrong.

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.060
Um, but anyway, it's, it's fun.

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.540
It's, playing the Xbox Live one can be fun.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:48.820
But yeah, I get what you're saying, though.

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.820
It does get old.

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:52.460
A lot of these game show things get old, but if there was that variety, I think it could

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:53.460
be pretty cool.

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:58.740
Especially, like, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, I think these could be cool games to do live.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:04.220
Um, you know, with the whole, like, you know, I don't think everybody would just watch three

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.220
players.

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.220
But maybe if everybody got, you know how, like, 1 versus 100 splits you up into parties

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:10.220
of four?

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:11.220
Yeah.

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.140
Maybe if these games did that, it splits you up into random parties of three, and you played

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:20.260
a predetermined puzzle or predetermined set of questions, and then you can see, maybe,

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:25.340
at the end, who, out of all the matches, was, like, the top, who got the big, big score.

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.100
I mean, there's ways you could do it, I think, and make it fun.

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:31.620
But, sadly, I don't think THQ is going to be doing that, because, guess what?

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:35.700
They're actually going to be releasing them specifically on the Wii and the DS.

01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:40.060
So, in other words, get ready to spin the wheel with your Wiimote.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:43.380
And they're going to be as bad as successful as The Price is Right and the other games

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:45.900
that came out, which were not very much.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.620
Yeah, I heard Press Your Luck and Price is Right weren't that bad.

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:53.500
But, anyway, later this year, when those first games are coming out, the statement, by the

01:31:53.500 --> 01:32:00.160
way, about these games came from the THQ kids, family, and casual games executive VP, so

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.780
no hardcore wheel of fortune for you.

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.220
I am sorry to say.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:08.540
I really wish they would go the live game show route, though, on Xbox Live.

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:10.300
I hope we do get some more of those.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.300
I really do.

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:14.260
Wouldn't it be cool to actually have a live Press Your Luck?

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.500
I would love that!

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.860
Or a live Price is Right.

01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:17.860
Old school.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:22.260
I mean, imagine, like, you could be in the audience with your little avatar higher, higher,

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.260
lower.

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.980
Do you have a Plinko party?

01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.100
There's so much more that can be done, and I hope it is done.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.100
Well, how about something, though, that's good news for a lot of people.

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:40.180
There's Fallout Las- sorry, Fallout New Vegas will be out summer 2010.

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.840
There's actually a trailer up and everything.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.060
It's being developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the same people that gave us Knights of the

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:53.380
Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Knights 2, and this is going to be a direct follow-up to

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:54.380
Fallout 3.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.380
You look kind of neat.

01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.180
I just know a lot of people like Fallout.

01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:02.380
Oh yeah, Fallout's a hugely popular game, especially number 3.

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.740
It's one of those games I have yet to play.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:07.780
It's in my little rental queue, but I haven't gotten the game yet.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:11.700
But I hear it's Oblivion with guns, but so much came out, you know, we don't have time

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:15.460
to play every single video game, but I'll try to get around to it, at least before Final

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:20.620
Fantasy XIII comes out, because when that comes out, yeah, I'm not really going to be

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:23.180
playing anything else for a while.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.180
I know myself.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:27.660
So sad.

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.340
All these games.

01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:32.940
So this is kind of interesting.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.100
You may remember back when we talked a little bit about how Walmart and Best Buy were kind

01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:42.700
of getting into this kiosk trade-in type of business.

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:48.180
They're going to be able to buy, sell, trade games, also rent out games, and I believe

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.900
DVDs as well.

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:58.460
Problem is, though, the company behind it, ePlay, has ceased operations.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:04.860
So I don't know if that means closing or out of business or whatever, but they're no longer

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:09.020
operating, if you will.

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:14.340
So unfortunately that will probably go away, which is too bad, because I hear that their

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:17.580
trade-in values are pretty good.

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:22.100
Not true, though, if you're doing that in Canada, because I believe actually in Canada

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:26.700
Best Buy actually handles their trade-ins in the store and not through a kiosk, so that's

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:28.700
kind of cool.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:40.100
Also GameCrazy, apparently the parent company movie gallery has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:47.660
again, and they're only basically going to drop it down to only 250 GameCrazy locations

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:54.240
once they're done and be liquidating close to 760 stores.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.660
I can vouch for that.

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:59.060
That's a lot of depressing news in the retail world.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.060
Yeah.

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.060
That's something that hits home here.

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:02.060
Oh, sure, I'm sure.

01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:04.500
Do you know yet if everything's going to be okay?

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.540
We're thinking that the Cameron Park store is going to be okay.

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.540
That's cool.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540
All right.

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.540
Well, good luck.

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:11.540
I hope everything turns out all right.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.540
Me too.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.540
You know, I like living in a house.

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.540
Yeah.

01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:15.700
Anyhow, on to happier news.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:20.660
Some of the comments in chat still talking about the whole ideas of game shows on Xbox

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.660
Live, and I think SSJ 100 Matt totally has the winner idea of what games should be on

01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.860
Xbox Live.

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.860
You ready?

01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:38.280
Ah, yes, the match game.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:41.580
If only they could find a way to bring back Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Riley from

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.580
the dead.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.580
It'd be amazing.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.740
Kind of a sad face news.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.340
You know I'm big on live journal, right?

01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:52.100
One of my good friends that I've had on live journal for years now ran a community on live

01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:56.860
journal called Match Game LJ, which, you know, kind of did like a little live journal version

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.860
of the match game every week.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.460
He decided to close it down this week, and he's not going to be running it anymore.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.220
Give me sad face.

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:06.800
So what up, Mark, if you're listening, although I doubt he is, but yes, match game should

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800
be on Xbox Live.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.800
That would be wonderful.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.800
I would love that.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:11.800
All right.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.860
On to some other news.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:16.900
This is definitely kind of an eyebrow raising piece here from Harmonics.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:21.460
Harmonics has apparently done some more licensing, and this really isn't a big surprise when

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:25.140
you consider, oh yeah, duh, Harmonics makes music games, and you know, they license stuff

01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:27.300
for Rock Band 2 all of the time.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.900
But look at some of the things they've been licensing lately.

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.460
This is all from the Royalty Network.

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.620
I guess some people were watching there.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:42.900
Anti Up by M.O.P., Say Ah by Trey Songs, Evacuate the Dance Floor by Cascada, The Way I Are

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.780
by Timbaland featuring DOE.

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.700
Those are all like dancy, poppy songs.

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:51.140
They don't belong in Rock Band.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.340
Or do they?

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.900
Or what is going on at Camp Harmonics?

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.120
Hmm.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.660
Could it be that Harmo- now there's a couple options here.

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:04.940
Harmonics could be looking at going a really radically different direction with Rock Band

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:07.740
3, perhaps.

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:12.340
It could be that they have a DJ, other type of like DJ Hero-ish game in the works, some

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:14.140
answer to that.

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:20.540
It could be that they have a DDR response in the works, a dance game, maybe a pop band

01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:21.540
type of game.

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:22.540
Who knows?

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.540
Dancing.

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.540
Who knows?

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.540
What do you think?

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:26.540
Or just a karaoke game.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.060
A karaoke game?

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:32.100
Although Harmonics did the original Karaoke Revolution, I mean I couldn't see Harmonics

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:35.500
doing just a karaoke game when there's so many on the market now and they're already

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.500
into Rock Band.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.500
I don't know.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.340
I've got to admit, you know what I'm tempted to say?

01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:43.140
I just- my gut tells me it's a dance game.

01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:47.700
That they're going to try to take the dance game crown from Konami and now's a pretty

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:50.580
good time, honestly.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:53.260
They could do it.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.900
I don't know, what do you guys think?

01:37:54.900 --> 01:38:00.100
Obviously this is a topic that hits home here at OLR.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.980
This show started over DDR.

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:07.660
The dance genre is really that popular anymore, I mean, I guess you've seen a couple titles

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:12.060
that are really kind of stand out now, but they're a little bit different than DDR, like

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.660
Just Dance is a title that I'm surprised is doing okay.

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.260
Actually, I have some co-workers, and I always talk about co-workers because that's my way

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:23.580
to gauge the casual gamer.

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.540
Do some of my co-workers that I would not imagine played a lot of Nintendo Wii love

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:30.100
Just Dance, and think it's like, great.

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.700
And I've heard some people on the show talking highly about it too, some of our chatters

01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:34.700
and stuff.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:39.280
Apparently it's this big cult music game that's doing very well, culty type.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.860
I gotta play it at some point.

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:44.060
But anyway, sorry, what was the rest of your thought there?

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:47.500
No, I'm just surprised that, you know, that's doing well.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:54.620
So I'm not sure if they would be going, like, that route though.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:58.860
Frisbee in our chatroom says Konami doesn't have the crown, StepMania does.

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.900
I'm just gonna say this and rip it off like a bandaid here and just kind of give you my

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:04.900
thought here.

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.420
StepMania is not legitimate.

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:10.780
I know that probably sucks to hear, and I know it's got a big community and everything,

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.660
but it's not legitimate.

01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.660
Neither is In the Groove.

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:17.340
Do you, well, In the Groove is a step above StepMania.

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:21.100
In the Groove was the way to try and legitimize StepMania, but let me put it this way.

01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:24.740
You do not walk into a GameStop and buy StepMania over the counter.

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:26.060
Or do you really buy StepMania at all?

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.180
I mean, it's just not, it's not the same.

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:31.040
StepMania was always there to emulate DDR.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.960
And then yeah, they tried to kind of innovate it later, especially within the Groove and

01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:39.400
so forth, but it's not, I mean, I could see Harmonix doing what Konami should have done

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:45.260
about six years ago and reinventing DDR from the ground up, which supposedly is also happening

01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:46.620
by Konami right now.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.420
I haven't heard what's up with that DDR game they're supposed to be putting out with eight

01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:51.420
panels.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:52.420
Like, wasn't that supposed to be out last Christmas?

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.420
It got delayed.

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:54.420
Uh, yeah.

01:39:54.420 --> 01:40:01.180
It was supposed to be actually out this spring, and it still hasn't been released yet.

01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:07.820
I think probably the second quarter, but even still, it's just, I can't get excited about

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.820
it.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:15.060
I go to DDRfreak.com and let's see, do I see anything about the new DDR game?

01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:22.300
Let's see, DDRfreak, Pump It Up Pro 2, StepMania, the manga, DJ Hero Deal, Cobalt Flux, back

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.900
in November, $40 Amazon credit with various hero bundles.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:26.900
Yeah.

01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:28.680
There's no news on DDR and even DDRfreak.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:33.540
I mean, that is a sign about how Konami has fumbled and dropped the DDR crown.

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:38.860
I think if Harmonix were to show up at E3 with a new dance game, with not, I hate to

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:41.860
say it guys, I know I'm going to piss some of you off with this comment, but without

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:45.620
the J-pop and the stuff that most people on this side of the ocean don't know, but stuff

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:50.860
like Timberland and Cascada and people actually recognize from clubs, uh, Harmonix is going

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:57.860
to, they're going to do to DDR what they did to Guitar Hero, or Guitar Freaks, sorry, with

01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:58.860
Guitar Hero.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:00.140
That could be what we're looking at.

01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.140
Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:05.660
And it could be not, it could be that Rock Band 3, I mean, again, this is all speculation.

01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:10.860
I don't know why my gut just tells me Konami is vulnerable right now.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:14.780
If DDRfreak can't even tell you the latest and what's going on with eight panel DDR and

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:19.260
this whole reinvention of the franchise, I mean, hello, something is wrong.

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:20.260
Right?

01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.260
Yeah.

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:25.460
You know, we technically do have eight panel DDR, Rob.

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.460
Doubles.

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.460
You know what I'm talking about.

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.460
I know.

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:29.460
I know.

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.460
Well, just like quad mode.

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.860
How did that ever catch on?

01:41:31.860 --> 01:41:32.860
I don't know.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:36.580
Dark Tetsuya is saying, so Rob, are you saying DDR is dead?

01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:39.580
Um, well, yes.

01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:42.740
It kind of died about five years ago.

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:45.780
Around the time this show stopped talking about DDR was kind of when it was starting

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:46.780
to die.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:51.860
I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't think it'll ever die, but it's not what it was 10

01:41:51.860 --> 01:41:53.380
years ago.

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:54.820
Let's face it.

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:55.820
Reality check.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:56.820
All right.

01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:01.580
Anyhow, hey, let's get into some more pleasant topics and talk a little bit about, uh, what

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.940
is going on in our email bag.

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:04.940
That's right.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:10.480
Every week we invite you guys to send us emails to our email address at mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:14.340
And every week Dark Sakura likes to tear the mailbag open and read some of her favorite

01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:17.380
emails for us to respond to here on the show.

01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:22.380
So Dark Sakura dive into the mailbag and tell us what emails are we getting this week?

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:25.900
Well, we got one recent, it was one of the ones that were deleted when I was getting

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:26.900
rid of the spam.

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:29.220
Um, so I'll go ahead and read it first.

01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:31.380
Um, hi, OLR crew, AZHP here.

01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:35.820
I was listening to your podcast from the 10th and her Jamie brush off the rock star forced

01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.620
overtime deal because they would get time and a half.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.980
I work in the programming industry as well, and I can tell you with a percent certainty

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:45.860
that pretty much no one in the entire industry in California gets paid a cent of overtime

01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:46.860
furthermore.

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.820
And this is generally the norm for the games industry in general.

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.980
Employees are forced to work 12 hours, six to seven days a week with no overtime pay,

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:58.900
no compensation for PTO, no bonuses, and sometimes even no vacation by the way, PTO is paid time

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.900
off for those who don't speak office speak.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.620
Sometimes even a vacation after project is finished.

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:08.340
There are also generally threats of dismissal if one does not go into work.

01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:13.460
These people are so fatigued getting one or zero days off that week, they make them more

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.840
and more mistakes and they have to stay even longer to fix them.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:20.400
There is a law in California that says you can be exempt from getting paid overtime if

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.020
you make more than $90,000 in a year.

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:26.040
However, game developers generally make about half that.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:32.880
It might seem like a decent salary, but when you're working 100 hours, 100 hour work weeks,

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:35.300
it equates to about $14 an hour.

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.500
Now you might say, take it up with the law or quit.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:41.140
However, these people are so overworked that they don't have the time to file a lawsuit.

01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:44.620
And getting into the industry is so hard because there are so few studios owned by even fewer

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:48.740
publishers that it's 100 times harder to get a job in the games industry than it is any

01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:50.900
other job, especially in our economic climate.

01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:54.580
I'm sorry for the lengthy rant, but I was appalled at the complacency of the crew on

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:58.340
reporting on the story and wanted everyone to know the true nature of the beast so that

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:01.960
they could understand what most game developers go through to bring you the games you love

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:02.960
to play.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960
Yours truly, AZHP.

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.300
PS, sorry about the terrible Silent Hill joke last time.

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:07.300
I just had to.

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:13.140
Now my point is, is that it's because no one says anything that this shit continues.

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:15.280
I kind of, I sort of agree.

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.780
Like I don't, I don't want to say I'm complacent with this.

01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:21.540
I mean it does strike me as very wrong, but at the same time I feel like I don't know

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:25.720
enough about that perspective because most of the people I know that work for developers

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.580
aren't making these same complaints.

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:30.860
And I don't know if it's because of, and it's addressed in that email, the fear of if they

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:32.900
speak up, they're going to get fired.

01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:37.260
But if everything that's in that email is true, that's bullshit.

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:38.300
Of course it's bullshit.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:42.620
And maybe the wife should be speaking up and somebody has got to stand up for these people

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.100
and put a stop to this.

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:47.060
By the way though, you don't have to make 90,000 a year to be exempt from overtime.

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.060
Trust me, I know.

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.060
Yeah, no.

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:53.860
But if you, if you are an exempt employee, then your overtime is counted in other ways.

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:57.500
But yes, there are still boundaries.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:02.060
You know, I, I don't like to talk a lot about my day job because I don't want to ever jeopardize

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.060
that here on the show.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.620
But I will say these few key things.

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:09.900
I am an exempt employee where I work, but anytime I do have to work those extra hours,

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.380
my company is very good about balancing it out.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.380
I don't ever feel...

01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:15.860
You get basically comped time, right?

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.860
In a way.

01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:20.380
I think I should reveal those types of things on the show, but you know, there, there, there

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.380
are ways they make up for it and I don't feel overworked and everybody should have that.

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.540
I've had times at my job where they say, oh, we've got mandatory overtime this weekend.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.940
And I'm like, I'm not coming.

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:30.940
Why not?

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.400
Um, I'm not coming.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.820
I have other things to do.

01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:34.820
I made plans.

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:35.820
Sorry, I'm not coming.

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.180
And they'll be like, oh, well, okay.

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.780
Cause they cannot make you work mandatory overtime.

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:47.060
They just say mandatory because they're strongly suggesting it because they need to have the

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:48.060
people there.

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:52.740
And maybe it's mandatory for them to request the overtime, but it's not mandatory that

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:53.740
you take it.

01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:57.460
That you, you know, go in and work on your day off.

01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:59.540
We have a law for a reason.

01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:06.820
And if, I'm sorry, I really don't feel very sorry for these people who, well, okay.

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:10.640
I actually, no, I don't feel sorry because yeah, it sucks that they have, they're having

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.420
such a hard time, but as long as they're not doing anything to change it, you know, then

01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.460
they're just adding to the problem.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.460
They're adding to the problem.

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.660
Well, maybe that's why the wives are speaking out.

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:23.020
Maybe, maybe people, I mean, I can see what he's saying in the email there about there

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:26.580
is a very real fear that if I speak up, I'm going to be fired.

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.900
I could see that.

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:28.900
But that's illegal.

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.900
It's a tough industry to crack into.

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:33.880
But it still doesn't change the fact of what the law is.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.140
I don't want to get too political here, but is it just throwing ideas out there?

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:44.260
Is it possible that there could be a union of developers and people that work in the

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.260
game industry?

01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:46.500
I mean, maybe that's what's needed.

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.500
I would say so.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:51.180
I mean, if, if it seems like- Do we need Sally Field to jump up on a table

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:55.020
with her sign about starting a union?

01:46:55.020 --> 01:47:04.500
Well, I, I think that if anyone is working in that kind of condition, the, it doesn't

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.460
matter how exhausted they are.

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:13.220
You know, if someone does not think enough of themselves, their family, and doing work

01:47:13.220 --> 01:47:19.140
that they enjoy to try to make their workplace a better place to be, then they don't need

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:20.140
to be there.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:23.540
Uh, one of our listeners in chat, I'll, I'll, I'll withhold their name here because they

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:27.780
are saying something somewhat negative, uh, says, it's hard to say no to our Sakura.

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:33.620
Once is okay, twice you don't get a raise and all the industry is connected.

01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:36.140
I mean, I, he's speaking to that same fear.

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:38.820
I mean, I get what you're saying, but I get what he's saying.

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:41.300
There's got, something has to give.

01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.300
You know what I mean?

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:43.300
Well, that goes back to the same thing.

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:46.780
If you are unhappy with the environment, you change it.

01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:50.660
You know, one person may be one person, but for every one person that has a particular,

01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:56.280
uh, distaste for something, there are going to be at least eight other people around them,

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.060
very close to them that have that same feeling.

01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:03.540
And sometimes all it takes is for one person to say something before everybody else decides,

01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.100
Hey, yeah, we agree.

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.420
Well, this issue is long from over.

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:08.460
I'm sure about that.

01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:10.940
Maybe it's going to end up being the wives that take this on.

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:11.940
I don't know.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:14.460
It's going to be very interesting to see what develops, but for now we should probably move

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:18.780
on to another email.

01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.620
One comes from lucky nuts.

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:23.340
Hey, Jamie keeps talking about her vault.

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:28.060
I too have a vault that I've kept for the last 20 years or so, and I'm considering spending

01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:32.900
the next few months clearing it out on eBay to buy more grownup things like a new sailboat.

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:35.820
Have you ever thought about clearing out your collection and if so, did you later regret

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:36.820
it?

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:40.260
Um, first of all, grownup is a concept.

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:46.660
You know, you're getting rid of one thing for recreation to get another thing for recreation.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:48.500
Grownup is bullshit.

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.140
You know, so drop that little attitude right there.

01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:56.660
I hate that attitude so much and no, I'm not getting rid of the collection ever.

01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.660
I love our collection.

01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.660
I go back and use all this stuff.

01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.780
I get, I'm happy just looking at it.

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:04.940
Like, I like going in the vault and just looking around and going, damn, we got some cool shit.

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:05.940
Look at all this shit.

01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:06.940
I know.

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:07.940
That's just how I feel.

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:11.660
And then she'll invite other people over, Rob, Rob, come over and look at all my shit.

01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:14.660
Come over here and help me play with this.

01:49:14.660 --> 01:49:19.500
You know, and by the way, if you go to our YouTube channel, um, you can actually see

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:23.220
some video taken in the vault if you want to see what I have.

01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.140
And if you are going to sell some of your stuff though, talk to me.

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.140
Nice.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.660
Maybe you'll have something I want.

01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:34.580
I just to say from, from a non-collector perspective, I've sold some of my stuff.

01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:37.900
I've never really regretted it though, cause I try to really think about it and not sell

01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:40.060
anything that I think I might remotely play again.

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:43.860
Like I think I sold my copy of Dead or Alive for, I just knew I wasn't going to play that

01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:44.860
again.

01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:47.460
Misty said she was happy looking at it while she was visiting.

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:49.780
There you go.

01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:54.220
Um, now I did get two emails from one other person, but I'm only going to read one of

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.540
them because really the first one was all like, I like Silent Hill Shattered Memories.

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.880
Can I say though real quick though, if you did sell your collection and buy the sailboat,

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:07.740
you know that you could say, I'm on a boat.

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:09.580
You know, that's one of my ringtones on my phone.

01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:10.580
Is it?

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.580
I'm not surprised.

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.020
It's the one when, uh, when work calls.

01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:14.100
That's why you buy the sailboat.

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:15.100
You want to say I'm on a boat.

01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.020
I don't want to be on a boat.

01:50:17.020 --> 01:50:19.940
I want to play my games.

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.380
Games are more versatile than a sailboat.

01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:25.420
You can, you can go in your house unless your electricity is off.

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.620
You can play your games anytime.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:30.620
That's a dark Sakura song would be, I got a vault.

01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.420
I got a vault, motherfucker.

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.420
A vault.

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:37.700
But you can only go on your sailboat, first of all, if you're licensed for it.

01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:41.620
A sailboat is going to give you a lot more cost and upkeep and storage.

01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:46.500
Dude, you're going to save yourself some money just by keeping your games and renting a boat

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.620
for a weekend.

01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:48.620
The end.

01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.860
Cause then you don't have to do all the crap to it.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:52.260
God, I'm smart.

01:50:52.260 --> 01:50:56.140
I should just be a financial advisor even though I kind of, you know, kind of suck at

01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:57.140
it.

01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.140
You're a goddamn boat idiot.

01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.380
You don't need a boat.

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:02.540
You need a- Fuck boats.

01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:03.540
Rent it.

01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:05.340
Jamie, you need a- Charter a boat.

01:51:05.340 --> 01:51:08.100
Jamie, you need a financial advice podcast.

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.100
Fuck no.

01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:15.120
It would be nothing but Dan yelling at me for spending too much money on comics.

01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.120
Fuck rent.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:17.120
Buy comics.

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:21.340
So anyway, I'm going to read just the one email.

01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:27.620
Um, hello from Haseo- Haseo Sumiragawa.

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:35.540
Yeah this person, um, is, uh, yeah, anyway, and yes, DarkSakura, my grammar has greatly

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:41.780
improved except you're not using any capital letters and you misspelled grammar.

01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:46.140
I was wondering if you guys have ever played the MMO Mabinogi.

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:49.720
If so, have you- why have you guys never mentioned it?

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:50.820
Because we haven't.

01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:51.820
Never heard of it.

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:52.820
Ever.

01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:53.820
Why not try it?

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:59.260
I mean, it's a lot like World of Warcraft except for Mabi is PS3, the two- okay, is

01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:04.340
the PS3 of the two you pay for nothing except pet next to your characters unless you are

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.340
smart enough?

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.340
Uh, whatever.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.340
Is this spam?

01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.340
No, it's- Alright, just checking.

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:13.340
You know, I'm wondering if you- I really can't read this.

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:17.540
Do you know how easy it would be to- okay, I'll come stand behind you.

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:22.860
Okay, also on another note, the gift Rob got from Loki, where would I find when you can

01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:25.600
play an NES game on it?

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.580
It's an FC Mobile, look it up online.

01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:28.580
eBay.

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.300
Also I make AMVs from video- there's actually a couple sites that sell them to you.

01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:37.100
Also I make AMVs from video games and I was wondering, can you guys have any ideas for

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:38.100
an AMV?

01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:41.980
Yes, there should be an AMV where the main character is learning proper spelling and

01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:42.980
grammar.

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.400
It'd be fascinating.

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.900
Also update the podcast more often.

01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:46.900
Probably not.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:47.900
Okay, dude.

01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:48.900
I'm sorry.

01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:52.460
Also, spammers need to be raped with a flaya warhead.

01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:55.340
Now that I can get behind.

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:56.340
No pun intended.

01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:02.260
I'm sorry, I- you're- I can't read your email because it doesn't make sense in my brain.

01:53:02.260 --> 01:53:07.660
I'm sorry, I'll look at your YouTube videos, but your email hurts my head.

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.660
Alright.

01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:09.660
I'm sorry.

01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:10.660
I tried!

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:12.660
Are there any other emails?

01:53:12.660 --> 01:53:15.500
No, well there was another one written by the same person, but again-

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.220
Yes, read it, please, please, please!

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.220
I love Silent Hill.

01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:20.220
Okay, fine!

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:21.220
Shit.

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:25.620
Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played, so be nice, DarkSakura.

01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:27.180
Do I have to?

01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.740
Okay, this is a remake of the original- Too late.

01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:32.220
You play as Harry Masons whose daughter is missing, blah blah blah.

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.900
We know all that.

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:36.420
Um, the gameplay is seamless.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:46.900
Love the PSP, your trusty flashlight, adds an extra compen- commentary pending what you're

01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:47.900
looking at.

01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:48.900
Yeah.

01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:49.900
Sorry, I can't.

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:55.220
Also, though, but I do like this, the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.820
Um, go back and play the first Silent Hill.

01:53:58.820 --> 01:53:59.820
Can I try?

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:00.820
Can I try reading the review?

01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:02.140
Would you mind if I give it a shot?

01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:03.140
Give it a try, Rob.

01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:06.300
Hold on one minute, I'm gonna- I gotta bring it up here in studio here, and I will read

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.300
the review for you guys.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.300
Okay, cause it's really bad.

01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.300
Okay, hold on.

01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.820
Alright, hold on, I'm getting in there.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.420
Let's see, what is- Silent Hill Shadow Memories?

01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:14.100
That would be the one.

01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:21.540
Will this review involve- Okay, first off, this was the first Silent Hill game I've played,

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:23.540
so be nice, DarkSakura.

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.620
First off, this is a remake of the original.

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.920
You play as Harry Mason whose daughter is missing, and you travel through the mysterious

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:31.860
small town of Silent while searching for her.

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:33.940
Gameplay is seamless of the PSP.

01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:37.780
Your trusty flashlight adds an extra commentary pending what you are looking at.

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:42.140
You have a cell phone to take pictures of static memoirs and whatnot.

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:47.480
The most annoying part of the game is the physiatrist who pops up and pisses you off,

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.940
and the nightmare sequences are a pain in the ass without weapons.

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.960
The story changes pending on how you talk with the physiarist you could get ending where

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.500
she's not found or one where blah blah blah spoilers.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:02.180
The game is more fuck with your head than super scary.

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:06.220
I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:11.140
I thought for sure you were going to use one of the audio effects on our new mixing board,

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.300
but I was wrong.

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:13.300
You went back old dude.

01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:14.300
Echo voice, Rob!

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:15.300
Echo voice!

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.300
You want echo voice?

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:17.300
Echo voice.

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:18.300
Hold on.

01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.300
Ooh.

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:22.300
I own your soul.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.300
Whoa!

01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:29.140
I give it a 4.5 out of 5.

01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.260
Okay that's enough of that for real.

01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:32.860
It sounds like you're at the back end of a tunnel Rob.

01:55:32.860 --> 01:55:33.860
Alright.

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:35.940
New mixing boards are fun.

01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:36.940
That's it for the mailbag?

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.940
Yep.

01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:38.940
Alright.

01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:44.380
Uh, let's move on then to the FUs of the week because sometimes we get angsty here on this

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:45.380
show.

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.380
That poor guy is never going to email us again.

01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:49.420
But if you want to have your emails ready to kill, please send them to mailbag at orange

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.700
launch radio dot com.

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:54.940
Just remember, we have Yakety Sax ready to go whenever we need it.

01:55:54.940 --> 01:56:13.660
We also have the angsty music ready to go for the FUs of the week.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:14.660
Fuck you Cryptic.

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:17.780
For your damn servers.

01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:21.620
Make your servers hold more people so that I don't have to play a laggy STO.

01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:22.620
The end.

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.620
Loki.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:30.300
FU to people that break into my car and apparently there is a dude, or somebody, I'm assuming

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:36.620
it's a dude, that broke into my car last night because I had boxes in the back of my car

01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:42.700
to give to my coworker who's moving and those boxes were of a microwave and computers and

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:43.700
whatnot.

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:46.660
And so they thought, hey look, microwave and computers.

01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:50.340
So they broke the back window, pulled the box out and go, hey, this is a box.

01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.220
What the hell is this?

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:57.660
Unfortunately under those boxes was my rifle bag with all my airsoft guns and they decided

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.460
to take that in protest.

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:01.420
So I am without airsoft guns.

01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:03.460
So you gave a thief guns.

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:04.460
Good move, Loki.

01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.460
I gave a thief fake guns.

01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:09.660
Well, I gave him guns without batteries or any of the ammo because he didn't take any

01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.660
of the ammo.

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:11.940
It was just sitting right there.

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:12.940
Whatever.

01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:16.500
You know, I don't care because I haven't played airsoft in over a year or so.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:22.260
It's so sad, but if I want more airsoft guns I'll just buy more.

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:23.260
I have arcade stuff to play.

01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:30.220
I don't have time to play airsoft and it's been too, the weather's been crappy, so.

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:35.940
It's unfortunate, but it's not like, I'm not sad by it at all.

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:44.420
Well, if that's it for your FU of the week, mine would be just more moving angst and cleaning

01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:50.220
and putting things in boxes and moving it and yeah, it's everything that comes with

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.220
moving, but I'll be over it in a couple of weeks when it's over, I'm sure.

01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:55.220
Otherwise things are good.

01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:56.460
I don't have a lot to complain about.

01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:57.460
Life is happy.

01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:58.460
Yay.

01:57:58.460 --> 01:57:59.460
Butterflies and sparkles.

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.460
All right.

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:03.380
A couple more news stories for you guys and then your chance to interact with us live

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:08.540
on the phone on our Skype line at orange lounge radio or one eight seven seven game O L R

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:09.540
okay.

01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:10.540
Yes.

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:15.900
Uh, Dante's Inferno is getting some download content, which I think is bundled actually

01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.820
with the PlayStation three version.

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:25.580
Um, apparently someone got the game early or downloaded the game early and, um, recorded

01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:30.240
a video that they sent to Kotaku, which shows a new download content that's going to have

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:35.940
some new online, um, co-op actually a new playable character along with that.

01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:39.800
And there's some different, uh, trials apparently that you can play and you can create your

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.420
own new trials and share them online.

01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:44.420
So that's kind of neat.

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:51.060
Um, but apparently if, uh, it's not in the PS three version, I know it's definitely not

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.440
in the three 60 version.

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:56.020
So if you do have the three 60, uh, you'll have to get it in April.

01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:02.260
Um, hopefully it is included in the PS three version, in which case you'll get it immediately.

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.780
But that's neat.

01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:09.060
And um, I don't know if it's going to be free later on, but it's, uh, apparently a trailer

01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:10.780
that's on the disc.

01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:11.780
So.

01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:12.780
All righty.

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.740
Uh, I got one more story for you guys.

01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:18.500
Are you going to pick up Dante's Inferno by the way, just before I get to my thing?

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:25.780
No, because I have Borderlands and I now have Bioshock two to play and really I'll just

01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:27.740
pick up God of War three.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:31.900
Although Dante's Inferno looked kind of cool and you know, I'm, I'm interested just to

01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:37.020
kind of play through it mindlessly, but not right away.

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:41.420
I'll wait for the maybe drop in price or, and Final Fantasy 13 is right around the corner.

01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:44.380
So it's like, I really don't have time to play all these games.

01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:47.620
It's just, it's just too many games.

01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:51.020
I'll probably put it in the queue of things to play, like on my literal, now that I use

01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:55.020
a rental game, so I stopped spending 60 bucks on games every week, uh, put it in my queue

01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:56.020
of things to play.

01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:59.500
But you know, one thing I'm learning, you don't always get what's number one on your

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.500
list right away.

02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:03.660
It's not quite as effective as Netflix, just so you know.

02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:07.340
Anyhow, uh, one other story for you guys, and this does have to do with spending money,

02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:12.580
uh, buying stuff on your computer, uh, using one of those, uh, digital distribution sites.

02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.460
You know, Steam, they are, uh, probably the kings of what's going on.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:23.140
But there's some other websites that sell games too, and one of them is GOG.com, GOG.com,

02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:26.020
or you might call them the good old games.

02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:29.700
If you think about it, it's kind of a site that tries to legitimize abandonware.

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:33.500
If you've never heard of that term before, a lot of folks like to use some weird clause

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:37.100
in copyright law, which I think some dude just made up because he wanted to justify

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.100
the theft.

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:42.220
Um, is that if a game hasn't been published for seven years, then it's okay to send on

02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:43.220
the internet wherever you want.

02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:44.620
You can, uh, send that game out there.

02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:49.620
Well, uh, obviously some publishers are not having that, uh, but GOG.com or good old games

02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:55.940
tries to kind of legitimize that by selling DR free, DR, I'm sorry, DRM free old games.

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:57.900
And they got some big lands this week.

02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:03.460
Um, they got a deal with Activision publishing to get some, uh, Sierra classics because Activision

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:09.060
has access to those classics now, uh, and that you can't even find on steam.

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:12.180
Some of those games, by the way, that are out right now, the first two that were added

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:15.860
are Canem of Steamworks and Magic Obscura.

02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:16.860
Definitely an Obscura title.

02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:20.460
Cause I haven't even heard of that one, but this one I definitely knew, Gabriel Knight

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.460
Sins of the Fathers.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.940
I don't know if you ever heard of this game, but I've heard of the Gabriel Knight games.

02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:25.940
Yeah.

02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:26.940
It's pretty cool.

02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:28.180
Cause Tim, Tim, Tim Curry does a voice in the game.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:32.140
It was one of his voice acting gigs, six bucks for each one of those titles.

02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:35.840
They are supposed to be doing like several titles a week over the next few months.

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.980
So a lot of these old school classic games, if you are curious and checking them out,

02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.180
you can go to GOG.com.

02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:47.680
Granted it's not the same as when that LucasArts pack was available for what, like nine bucks

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:48.680
or something.

02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.860
Some obscenely low price on steam over the holidays, but, uh, you know, you can still

02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:58.580
find some good old classic games because Loki doesn't have enough new games to play clearly.

02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.860
So he should add some classic games to his, uh, buffet too.

02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:06.780
I have plenty of games to play and I'm just trying to get through, I'm still trying to

02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:13.140
sort my Maim ROM collection to eliminate all the crap I'm not going to use.

02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:17.900
A lot of, several folks in chat chanting down with DRM, well that's one of their big things

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.140
is that they don't charge or they don't have really DRM on the games.

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:24.840
And so you can buy them and it's, you know, legitimate.

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.140
You can feel good karma and all that stuff and then not have to worry about the whole

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.940
abandonware and possibly getting viruses and all that stuff.

02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:34.100
So there you go.

02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:37.300
Anyhow that's going to do it for the news tonight and that's where we're going to go

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:38.580
to our Skype line.

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:44.220
It is now open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.900
We are taking your calls live on this Sunday evening, Super Bowl Sunday, February the 7th

02:02:48.900 --> 02:02:49.900
of 2010.

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:53.740
While we wait for some calls to come in, Loki's got some last minute stories for us.

02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:56.260
Yes, uh, I do.

02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.300
Well I just assume you usually do.

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:02.380
If you didn't, I guess I was wrong.

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:07.220
Uh, no, actually there's some other stuff we can talk about, um, of course I don't have

02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:09.460
to pull it up yet because that would be really awesome.

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:11.380
Actually we'll talk about this real quick.

02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:15.860
There's a game, Tales of Innocence, which was released on DS, um, in Japan.

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:17.580
You gotta reprieve, you gotta call.

02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:19.460
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.540
Hi, this is Spaznator.

02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:24.540
Hi Spaznator, what's on your mind buddy?

02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:33.180
Uh, two things, um, yeah, uh, I didn't know if you guys saw my tweets earlier in the week,

02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:40.060
but, um, I thought it was kind of worth mentioning, uh, there's, uh, anime series that, uh, I

02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:42.060
think you guys may want to check out.

02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:46.620
I, before I can go back and check with Sakura into, uh, Anime as well.

02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:50.180
Wait, hold that thought, hold that thought, because speaking of anime series, I, I totally

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:53.040
forgot to get into this at the top of the show and I wanted to.

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:58.380
This weekend I went to Japantown in, uh, San Francisco and I totally thought of Jamie,

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:02.780
because I, well, A, I saw the Taiyaki place that, um, I know she really loves and she

02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:05.040
likes to eat there and it made me think of her.

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.040
And then we went to Japan video and some of those places and we were looking at, um, anime.

02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:12.140
And I saw the Ragnarok anime on DVD.

02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:14.660
I guess they made like 25 episodes of a Ragnarok anime.

02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:16.700
Yeah, they have a whole season, it's actually pretty good.

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:17.700
I've watched most of it.

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:18.700
Have you?

02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:19.700
Because it made me think of you.

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.380
I was like, I should get this for Jamie and then I'm thinking, no, she probably already

02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:22.380
has it.

02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:26.580
But actually I downloaded it when it first started coming out on TV and I never finished

02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.580
it.

02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:28.580
Oh, okay.

02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:29.580
And so it actually won.

02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.500
It was pretty cute, pretty, you know, close to the game.

02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:36.500
I'm already getting the new DS one, the US one, um, cause I tried playing it in Japanese.

02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.660
I tried.

02:04:37.660 --> 02:04:42.300
But a completely, completely random tangent right next to all that stuff is a little store

02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.420
called Pika Pika, which is a picture booth store.

02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:47.860
It's one of the stores that's nothing but picture booths.

02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:51.500
Now I met up in Japantown with a bunch of people that I play World of Warcraft with.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.620
So it's like we had an IRL raid.

02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:57.460
So we raided Pika Pika and one of the photo booths there and there was like six of us

02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.460
in the photo booths.

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:02.620
Like it takes like $9 to take a picture, but it's all like green platforms you stand on

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:04.100
and it puts in backers.

02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:06.540
We had so much picture club.

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:08.180
It was so much fun.

02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:11.380
Like seriously, I think these only exist in big cities.

02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:13.180
I've seen one by Arcade Infinity too.

02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:16.660
There used to be one right next door there, but if you have one of these in your town,

02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:17.660
it's a lot of fun.

02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:18.660
Oh yeah, totally.

02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.660
Okay.

02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:20.660
Sorry.

02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:21.660
What else do you want to talk about?

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:22.660
Uh, it's called Dumslinger Girl.

02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:32.340
I don't know if either one of you have heard of it, but it's, uh, there's two, uh, seasons

02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.340
of it.

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:41.380
Both are like 13 episodes long and the trick synopsis of it is, uh, you know, this government

02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:48.700
agency over in, uh, really basically, uh, takes in, uh, you know, kids, they're basically

02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:58.860
dying to, uh, $6 million, you know, women type cyborgs and, uh, has them, uh, do, uh,

02:05:58.860 --> 02:06:04.140
assassinations for like, uh, assassinate terrorists and stuff like that.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:08.100
So wait, Gunslinger, hold on, Gunslinger Girl was the name of the anime?

02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:09.100
Yeah.

02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:10.980
And you've, have you ever heard of this dark side?

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:11.980
Yes, I have.

02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:12.980
I wanted to try it out.

02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:14.780
It's just, you know, I haven't had a lot of time.

02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:17.100
Is this something available on the PlayStation 3 marketplace?

02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:21.660
Cause I know anime is like a big niche that they have on there that, uh, yes, it is.

02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:28.220
Uh, there's, you know, season one and season two, and I think, uh, there's, uh, uh, I don't

02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:32.300
want to call it a season three, but there is, uh, like another season there.

02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:37.020
I think it's like, uh, like a reimagining of the entire series.

02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:41.820
Uh, you want me when I call it like season 2.5, we were, if you want to call it that.

02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:42.820
Okay.

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:43.820
Like a special, sure.

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:51.060
Yeah, but I have the entire season one and season two and I took very stuck season two

02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:56.580
about a day and, oh my God, it's epic.

02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:02.500
I mean, you know, it, you know, some always, you know, popping a video podcast kind of

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:08.220
like don't really like season two so much, but no, I love it personally.

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:13.140
So take that as you may, but you know, all in all it's pretty good.

02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:17.140
We'll have to recommend that to the listeners and to the anime fans here in studio as well.

02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:18.140
Gunslinger Girl.

02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:19.140
Okay.

02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:20.140
So sound really excited about that.

02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:22.580
Anything else on the PlayStation network we should be checking out right now?

02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:23.580
Uh, yeah.

02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.540
Uh, it's something you kind of sort of touched on on your last show.

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:35.220
Uh, it's, uh, the new, uh, music guidance Sigma 2, uh, table for Zen Pinball.

02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:36.220
Uh-huh.

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:44.300
I just stopped today and it's pretty good, uh, in fact, first of all, I think it's a

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:48.980
little bit better than some of the other tables that are currently available for the game.

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:49.980
I like Zen Pinball.

02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.980
I'll have to check that out.

02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:52.980
Yeah.

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:53.980
Yeah.

02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.220
I'd definitely give her a thumbs up on that.

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:57.220
All right.

02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:01.820
Well, uh, uh, let's get going so, uh, you can take more calls.

02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:02.820
All right.

02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:03.820
Yep.

02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:04.820
Well, you have a good week, Spaznator.

02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:07.540
Give me a phone call and we'll forgive you for the bad joke on Twitter earlier.

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:08.540
Okay.

02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:09.540
All right.

02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:10.540
You too, buddy.

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:11.540
Bye.

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:12.540
877 game.

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:13.540
OLRs.

02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:17.540
The number to call her username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:22.780
Uh, by the way, taking a call from the East coast does remind me, uh, PAX East is probably

02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:23.780
about what?

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:24.780
Six, seven weeks away.

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:26.020
Uh, PAX East is sold out.

02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:28.020
So if you didn't get a ticket, you're out of luck.

02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:30.220
Uh, I guess you maybe can still get a one day ticket.

02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:33.060
Uh, and I'm going, I'm going to PAX East.

02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:35.180
And I've like, really, I have tickets.

02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:37.980
I, I actually just bought a regular ticket.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:42.220
I decided I didn't want to do the media thing because a, PAX doesn't really do much for

02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:43.220
media.

02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:44.220
And that's fine.

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:45.220
I totally am cool with that.

02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:47.700
And I think that's actually the way I wish E3 was that way.

02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:52.500
Um, and so, you know, I just, I'm just, I'm going as a gamer, as a fan and you know, just

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:56.340
like the rest of you and, and don't really want to have to work through all of the packs.

02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.320
So, uh, I'm just going to have fun.

02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:59.460
So I'll be around at the show.

02:08:59.460 --> 02:09:00.460
I'm going to try.

02:09:00.460 --> 02:09:05.220
When the schedule comes out, I will try to find like a gaming lounge time, maybe with

02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:08.060
the DS game I enjoy, uh, that I'll go be at.

02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:11.660
And I'll let you guys know more about that when it gets a little closer to the show.

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:12.940
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:13.940
Who's this?

02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:14.940
Good day, sir.

02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:17.220
This is Lieutenant South, tell me of USS Takahashi.

02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:19.840
I'm pressing permission to come aboard.

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.980
Are you a Star Trek Online addict as well?

02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:24.180
Yeah, I just picked it up last night.

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:25.180
It's Ron Matt, everyone.

02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:26.180
Yes.

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.180
Hi, how you doing?

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:29.140
Sir, you getting the lag too?

02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:30.140
Not really.

02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:34.420
Because it's, I mean, I don't think it's my graphics card.

02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:39.060
I think it's their servers, but I had to wait in the queue of 118 and it takes like five,

02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:41.900
you know, five whole seconds to move in any direction.

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:44.100
I have not had that problem at all.

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:47.860
And mind you, my video card is like almost three years old.

02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:52.260
Yeah, mine's actually just under what the correct one is supposed to be.

02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:56.180
And, but it's seriously, they say they're supposed to be increasing server capacity,

02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.380
but they haven't yet.

02:09:58.380 --> 02:09:59.380
I don't know.

02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:02.420
I just haven't had that problem at all.

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:05.940
It may also be the difference in locations that we're at too, because right now I've

02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:11.060
been, I just hit memory alpha and my character's all like running all over the place and there's

02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:12.060
a ton of people there.

02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:14.600
So maybe it has to do with location too.

02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:15.600
I believe so.

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.140
So is this what you called in to talk about tonight at Star Trek Online or?

02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:20.540
Well, that too.

02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:21.540
That too.

02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:26.860
Um, first thing I want to talk about, something from a couple of podcasts in the, before you

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:32.820
mention about how it's possible for Steam to sell so many games at dirt cheap prices.

02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:33.820
Yes.

02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.620
I believe I have the answer for that.

02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:36.620
Please.

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:37.620
Okay.

02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:41.380
I used to work in a video store and we would rent games, so on and so forth.

02:10:41.380 --> 02:10:46.220
Once the rental of the game got to a certain point, we could sell it at a price because

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:50.240
all the rentals made the money back on the purchase of the game.

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.680
My thing is with Steam, once they have this game, they sell it at that price.

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.980
Once they've made the money back on selling the game, they can just cut the price to as

02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:03.440
cheap as they want and that shares extra cash for them.

02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:07.300
But I would still think that the deals are based on percentages of sales.

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:11.060
That seems kind of odd that, you know, that it would work based on, you know, how much

02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:13.380
of it sells, I guess.

02:11:13.380 --> 02:11:14.380
I get what you're saying.

02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:15.380
It makes sense.

02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:16.380
But I don't know.

02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:20.940
I think maybe the whole like retail strategy to digital distribution seems a little apples

02:11:20.940 --> 02:11:21.940
to oranges.

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:22.940
I mean, you could be right though.

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:29.300
I mean, because when we rent these games, like there was one game, you know, we have

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:35.100
like five copies of Mortal Kombat, three of them will be selling for like $30 and two

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:41.060
will be selling for, I'd say, $40 because of the rental turnaround rate on those games.

02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:47.020
I mean, if they get a game, they sell at this price, they make the money back off of, you

02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:52.300
know, the licensing, the rights, the time it costs to be invested into it, and there

02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.300
you go.

02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:56.660
Well, I was also just the mindset, I mean, honestly, I always still kind of think the

02:11:56.660 --> 02:12:00.180
reason for the sale is that, you know, assuming it is based off percentages, those companies

02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:05.300
are still making $5 off a game they would have made no dollars off of had it not been

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.860
on Steam on a huge sale.

02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:10.060
You know, some money is better than no money, a long forgotten game that got booted off

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:11.980
of shelves years ago.

02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:13.660
So I don't know.

02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:14.660
Good thought though.

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.660
I mean, anything is possible.

02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:19.200
And unfortunately, until we know somebody on the inside at Steam that knows the agreements

02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.300
of the arrangements, we just won't know.

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:24.260
Yeah, but we can go off of that for the time being.

02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:25.260
All right.

02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:26.260
Fine.

02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:27.260
Anything else?

02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:31.460
I just want to say thanks for listening, for taking the chance to listen to my podcast

02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:32.460
over the weekend.

02:12:32.460 --> 02:12:36.100
I have to admit I downloaded it, but I didn't listen to it yet, but I will.

02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.520
That's fine, that's fine.

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:43.540
And if you're looking for good titles, I recommend Kidu Tenshi Angelic Layer.

02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:46.020
It's free on Netflix right now.

02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:50.700
What are some good animes based off of video games?

02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:52.660
Remember Tower Jiraga, that old video game?

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:53.900
I do.

02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:54.900
That's become an anime.

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:55.900
I believe it's been licensed.

02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:56.900
Interesting.

02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.660
Well, they had kind of a renaissance of that game a while ago, too.

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:01.500
There's a new Jiraga game, I think, on PS2.

02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.500
That makes sense.

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:03.500
Yeah.

02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:04.500
Very interesting.

02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:05.940
One other quick question I have for you.

02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:10.580
A movie I saw at the video store that looked hilarious, and I don't know, maybe Jamie knows

02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:11.580
of this, too.

02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:12.580
Apparently, it was a...

02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:15.640
And I can't remember the name of it, but apparently it was a Japanese movie directed by the same

02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:21.980
guy who did Ichi the Killer, and it was advertised as, um, The Sound of Music meets Dawn of the

02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:22.980
Dead.

02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:28.340
That, I don't know, but I believe the director was Takahashi Mike or Miike.

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:33.380
It looked hilarious from the box art, and I was wondering before I go out and either

02:13:33.380 --> 02:13:37.900
spend money on that or obtain it through questionable means, if it was worth my time.

02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:44.660
Um, anything along those lines of Ichi the Killer, I keep hearing is well worth the purchase.

02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:50.780
I'm actually using a website I should have used a long time ago and looking up Ichi the

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:51.780
Killer on...

02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:54.060
The Hills Are Alive with Sound?

02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:56.200
It has another name to it, though.

02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.100
That's like the little tagline, I think, to the...

02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.100
It's, um...

02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.860
The Family Something was the name of it.

02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:05.140
The Happiness of the Katakris?

02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.060
Yes, that's it.

02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:09.900
That's the name of it.

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:11.020
That I've not heard of.

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:13.580
The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of Screaming?

02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:16.340
The Sound of Music Meets Stone of the Dead.

02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:17.340
That was it.

02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.340
That was the box I saw.

02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:21.040
It's awesome because it does look exactly like, uh...

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:22.460
It made me lol for real.

02:14:22.460 --> 02:14:24.140
Alright, that'd be awesome.

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:27.500
Alright, well maybe somebody else will call in later and tell me about that.

02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:30.020
Alright, Ramo, we're gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you as always,

02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:31.460
and hey, have fun on Star Trek, okay?

02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:32.460
I will.

02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:33.460
Calm out.

02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:34.460
1-877-GAMEL-OR.

02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:42.460
At first I was like, was that a Seacrest Out thing?

02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:45.140
But no, I forgot they do that in Star Trek.

02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:46.140
1-877-GAMEL-OR.

02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:48.300
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:50.700
We'll take maybe one more call, I don't know.

02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:51.700
We'll see how it goes.

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:55.140
Uh, Loki, I keep cutting you off, but we'll see how far we can get before we get another...

02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:56.140
Oh, never mind.

02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:57.140
We got another call.

02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.140
I know.

02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.140
You can try.

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:00.140
Psych!

02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:01.140
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:02.140
Who's this?

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:03.260
Uh, it's the one and only Legend of Zaku.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.500
Well, how are you doing, Legend of Zaku?

02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:08.620
Recovering from almost a hangover this morning.

02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:09.620
Nice.

02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:10.980
Were you drinking before noon?

02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:11.980
What's going on?

02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:14.060
No, it was basically last night's drinking.

02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:15.060
Oh, I see.

02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:21.940
Um, let's just say that I drank to the point where I, I drank into places where, into a,

02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.940
into a boundary.

02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:23.940
Okay, okay.

02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:25.940
You've got to stop, stop typing during the show.

02:15:25.940 --> 02:15:26.940
Seriously.

02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:27.940
You can't type right now.

02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:28.940
Go ahead.

02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:29.940
All right.

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.220
But yeah, I just wanted to bring up that whole, that whole harmonic speculation about, you

02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:35.220
know, the licenses.

02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:36.220
Oh yes, please.

02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:41.860
Um, basically, the way I see it is that Konami, the only thing they have going for them right

02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:44.320
now is lawyers.

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.980
In other words, they sued Roxer over ITG and they managed to win that case single-handedly

02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:52.100
and, and got their franchise.

02:15:52.100 --> 02:15:54.220
Because it was a complete rip-off of DDR.

02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:56.220
I, I hate to say it, but they had a right.

02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:59.540
And you could probably say the same thing for whatever Harmonics is doing with whatever

02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:02.340
they, we think they're doing with the, with those licenses.

02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:06.820
Right, it's going to be a rip-off of Beatmania because that's exactly what DJ Hero was, except

02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:07.920
it wasn't.

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.460
And so, you know, really, I think with a DJ game, assuming that's what they're doing,

02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:13.780
we don't even know what the hell they're doing.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:16.780
They could be doing, you know, Rockman stuff.

02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:17.780
I mean, who knows?

02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:18.780
Exactly.

02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:22.380
I mean, Harmonics still has, uh, amplitude and frequency.

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:27.740
Where did, didn't that make them famous before, before the whole, the whole Rockman thing?

02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:31.660
Harmonics was also not sued over Guitar Hero because the look and feel from Guitar Freaks

02:16:31.660 --> 02:16:33.060
was completely different.

02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:36.940
Whereas with IT in the groove, it, the look and feel was the exact same as DDR.

02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:41.200
I mean, right on down to the backgrounds and animations and, and pretty much the way the

02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:42.200
arrows looked.

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.200
They added mines.

02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:44.200
Woo!

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:45.200
You know what I mean?

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:49.460
Well, we also have to keep in mind that, uh, I mean, you could have said the same thing

02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.460
for Pump It Up.

02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:53.460
Wasn't that almost a rip-off of DDR with those arrows?

02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:59.420
I think though that went back, I want to say Konami and Amiro made an agreement many years

02:16:59.420 --> 02:17:03.340
ago because Pump It Up was actually first.

02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:05.660
But anyhow, I don't want to rehash that old news.

02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:06.660
I get it though.

02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:07.660
Okay.

02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:10.300
So, so the lawyers in, in litigation is how Konami keeps their franchises going.

02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:14.780
Well, that all depends on how, how, you know, how harmonics is actually going to approach

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:19.500
this, whether or not they're actually going to reinvent the same four panel dance, dance

02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:24.580
paradigm that we've seen for, for more than a decade or they're going to go into a new

02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:25.580
direction.

02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:30.980
Chances are, you know, if I was a betting man, I would say, I would say the latter just

02:17:30.980 --> 02:17:35.900
because they're pretty good at innovating, pretty good at innovating within, you know,

02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:36.900
within rhythm.

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:40.740
You know, and all, here's the thing though, all of this is speculation though.

02:17:40.740 --> 02:17:45.700
I mean, they could be licensing these songs for rock band for some weird little pop expansion

02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:46.700
they're doing.

02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:47.700
We don't know.

02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:48.700
You know, it could be nothing.

02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:52.540
I don't see those songs in particular being something that, that would blend well with

02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:55.380
rock band, you know, completely.

02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:58.780
The way I see it is that they're going to do something, they're, they're doing something

02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:01.500
outside of rock band with that.

02:18:01.500 --> 02:18:05.620
Or rock band three is, is something we haven't thought of yet.

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:09.980
I think PAX East is probably going to give us some clues because, you know, Harmonics

02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:12.140
is a huge, Harmonics is in Boston.

02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:13.720
This is happening in their backyard.

02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:16.620
So this is the perfect place for them to make an announcement.

02:18:16.620 --> 02:18:20.660
I think Harmonics is the kind of company that will drop a bomb at PAX East.

02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:26.780
See, I would love to, to go and see it for myself, but since I was, since I was unemployed

02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:32.920
and up until last week, there was no way, there was no way I would have gotten tickets

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:34.340
well in advance.

02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:38.100
Well congratulations on, uh, getting employment though, that's, that's good news, all things

02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:39.100
considered.

02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:40.100
Right.

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:46.260
But I guess, I guess time will tell to, you know, on what's going to happen, whether or

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:48.340
not they make good use of those licenses.

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:49.340
Exactly.

02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:53.260
And keep in mind, I will be, you know, whatever Harmonics puts out, if they do bring it to

02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:58.060
PAX East and I get a chance to get my grubby little hands on it, I will give it my critical

02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:01.580
eye with my music games background and I'll, I'll let y'all know.

02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:02.580
Right.

02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:03.580
Of course.

02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:07.460
Just try to make sure you don't want to, don't give them the benefit of the doubt.

02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:12.740
Try to, well try to like, uh, you know, add, press them on some hard questions, obviously

02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:18.140
not, you know, not treading into NDA stuff, but, but just try to like, challenge them

02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:22.700
that they, that they're trying to sell you on something that's, that you think is not

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:24.580
going to be revolutionary.

02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:25.580
I'll do my best.

02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:29.700
All right, Zaku, uh, any other thoughts here before we, uh, let you go?

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:34.500
Um, don't, don't drink a 40 ounce of liquor because all it, all that's going to do is

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:37.420
create, all it's going to do is purge your stomach.

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:39.420
It happened to me last night.

02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:40.420
Some sage advice.

02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:42.060
Have a good one, Zaku.

02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.060
Right.

02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:44.060
Later.

02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:48.180
We'll go ahead and take one more call if someone wants to call in 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:49.900
on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO.

02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:51.940
Loki, anything to tide us over?

02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:55.300
250 gigabyte hard drives coming out in Japan in March.

02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:56.300
Yay.

02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:58.300
Probably over here eventually.

02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:01.780
Uh, here's a good one.

02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:06.540
Sonic the Hedgehog is rumored to be playable in Mario Galaxy 2.

02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:09.300
Kind of going back to what we were talking about in part A.

02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:12.700
Where if Sonic the Hedgehog 4 fails, then Sonic will just be a Nintendo character.

02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:13.700
There you go.

02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:14.700
There you go.

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:21.620
Uh, let's see, there's a Dish Network channel that's going to be dedicated to Tetris.

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:22.620
You can play it on your TV.

02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:26.140
Didn't that come up a few weeks ago, or maybe that was the show that didn't happen, I don't

02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:27.140
remember.

02:20:27.140 --> 02:20:28.140
I don't remember.

02:20:28.140 --> 02:20:29.140
I don't remember something about...

02:20:29.140 --> 02:20:32.140
No, there was a new Tetris game in development, but it wasn't, it's not the Dish Network thing,

02:20:32.140 --> 02:20:35.740
it was something about somebody was making a new Tetris.

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:37.660
I wonder if the two are related.

02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:38.660
I don't know.

02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:39.660
Possibly.

02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:40.660
It's going to cost you $2.99 a month.

02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:43.900
Really, just play it free online, you don't need to play it on your TV.

02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.660
Play it on anything else.

02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:47.660
Anything else.

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:54.460
Um, according to Game Informer, and I got my magazine today, LA Noire is no longer a

02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:55.460
PS3 exclusive.

02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.180
Oh, it's hitting the Xbox 360 as well.

02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:01.940
Ugh, another one, lost.

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:03.900
That's too bad.

02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:08.500
That would be pretty cool, whenever the hell it comes out.

02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:09.500
Long ways away.

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:13.780
Speaking of something else that's not an exclusive anymore, High Voltage was bringing a brand

02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:17.740
new game, The Grinder, which is going to be a supernatural first person shooter game,

02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:22.460
originally going to be a Wii exclusive, however now it's coming to Xbox 360, PlayStation 3,

02:21:22.460 --> 02:21:23.940
and PC as well.

02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:27.220
And it will probably look way better than the Wii version anyways.

02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:32.140
Last call, by the way, for phone calls, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orange-lantredio,

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:35.140
if you want to call into the show, it's an empty line right now, Super Bowl Sunday's

02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:36.940
a good day when everybody's distracted.

02:21:36.940 --> 02:21:43.380
And Cracked In 2 had a contest to have fans submit user-made graffiti.

02:21:43.380 --> 02:21:51.620
And one of the pictures that got, I guess, won, was of these two male agents making out.

02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:54.340
Which is pretty awesome.

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:55.900
Interesting.

02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:57.220
Huh.

02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:03.620
I, okay, whatever, hey.

02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:04.620
That's all I have.

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:05.620
That's it.

02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:06.620
Alright.

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:12.140
I, oh, we just in the nick of time got another call, let's take this and then we'll wrap

02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:13.140
it all up.

02:22:13.140 --> 02:22:16.620
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:17.620
Hey, this is X-Link.

02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:19.860
Hey, X-Link, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:24.340
Hey, I'm glad to, I was reading Kotaku earlier on today and realized that they're coming

02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:27.780
out with a new version of Blaster Master come tomorrow, everywhere.

02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:30.020
I know, well, did you listen to Part A tonight?

02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:36.940
We had a joygasm over it in Part A. Oh, did you, I'm sorry, I was having, we were having

02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:37.940
some issues.

02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:38.940
Yeah, we know, Super Bowl, blah, blah, blah.

02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:42.660
No, no, no, no, nothing with Super Bowl at all, it was with the step-kids.

02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:44.660
Alright, well, okay, fair enough.

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:47.300
What is on your mind, though, at least about the Blaster Master game, what are your thoughts

02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:48.300
on it?

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:53.660
I'm going to think, I looked over the video they had out on YouTube and I, yeah, I gazzled

02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:59.460
myself pretty much because this was one of the first games I got back when I had my NES

02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:02.660
and I buy it with my own money and I absolutely loved it.

02:23:02.660 --> 02:23:05.980
In fact, I had the World of Power book.

02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:06.980
It was so good.

02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:09.180
Oh, those novels by, like, FX9 and stuff?

02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:10.180
Yes, yes, I have a bunch of them.

02:23:10.180 --> 02:23:12.020
Fuck yes, I had that one, too.

02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:13.700
And the Simon's Quest book, both were epic.

02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:16.540
I think I had the Metal Gear one, too.

02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:19.940
Yeah, I was missing this, too, because a lot of my books were burnt down, a lot of my old

02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:25.820
school stuff for the games that I had, my PS1 games, a lot of those, I had back in my

02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:32.420
mom's apartment when I was going from Orlando, Florida to Melbourne, Florida, a lot of stuff

02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:33.420
got burnt down.

02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:36.500
There was an arson in my mom's apartment and a lot of that stuff got burnt down, so I had

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:42.660
to go online and re-find the books, which, a lot of books I got, but the Simon's Quest

02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:46.740
and the Metal Gear are, if you have them in good condition, are really valuable and really

02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:47.740
hard to find.

02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:50.060
A lot of the text, though, at least, is available online.

02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:51.700
You can read a lot of those novels online.

02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:52.700
Yeah.

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:56.460
Yeah, it's not the same thing, you know, collectors and all that, but I do, just, like, complete

02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:59.460
random-ass fact about those books, and for those that don't know what we're talking about,

02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:04.240
the World of Power were these books that they wrote about old NES games, but since a lot

02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:08.340
of the 8-bit video games didn't really have stories that made for very good books, a lot

02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:12.340
of times the authors would kind of add their own stuff to it, like, for instance, I believe

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:17.460
the plot about Castlevania 2 had to do with some kid, like, warping himself into that

02:24:17.460 --> 02:24:18.460
world.

02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:20.300
Like, it wasn't even really about Simon Belmont, but somebody-

02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:21.620
To no end the Game Master.

02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:22.620
Rip-off!

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:23.980
His little sidekick.

02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:28.100
But there were some extra characters in Blaster Master to make that story work, too, and here's

02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:29.300
the interesting thing.

02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:33.700
I believe one of the characters was Eve, which was, I think, like, the name of the car or

02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:35.900
something, or, like, was one of the robot characters.

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:41.740
They actually, the programmers of Blaster Master, made Eve, they wrote her into the

02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:45.420
official canon, and she was in the Game Boy game.

02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:47.700
And it's also from part two, from what I understand.

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:51.460
I believe there was an actual part two for Blaster Master, and they brought the actual

02:24:51.460 --> 02:24:53.340
plot line from the book into the game.

02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:57.620
I think that was kind of neat, so, because Blaster Master was one of the better books.

02:24:57.620 --> 02:25:04.260
And also, the covers, a lot of times the covers were different from the actual game covers

02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:05.260
from the video game.

02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:08.980
That's right, because they took out, like, the gun from the Metal Gear cover, and they,

02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:09.980
yeah, I remember that.

02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:10.980
I remember that.

02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:11.980
I remember that one.

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:12.980
Yeah, so.

02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:15.580
But the kids' book, I mean, come on.

02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:19.820
Good times down memory lane, good times.

02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:22.740
They need to bring back those books, although I guess they do have them to some extent.

02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:26.100
Like, there's books about Halo, tons of books about World of Warcraft.

02:25:26.100 --> 02:25:28.300
Well, they're always bringing back, like, the Chijo Adventures.

02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:29.580
I couldn't see why they couldn't do it.

02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:34.980
I mean, you know, get the permission from the people and, you know, redo it, I mean.

02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:37.740
All right.

02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:40.900
But no, I was just mostly, I know you guys, you were looking for some calls, so it's called

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:41.900
about that.

02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:44.620
And I was the guy really giddy about that, because I, you know, I had a lot of my old

02:25:44.620 --> 02:25:47.780
school games, you know, like Blaster Master, you know, it was one of the first ones.

02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:49.740
Of course, Castlevania was in there, I want to.

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:51.740
Castlevania II, I remember spending hours on it.

02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:52.740
I'm giddy, too.

02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:53.740
I wish it was on PS3.

02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:58.860
Always burning out my friends, Nintendo, NES, because we had it on for 18 hours straight

02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:01.180
because we didn't want to turn it off, and, you know, we wanted to go through and beat

02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:03.780
the game, so.

02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:08.180
I'm excited, but I'm trying very hard not to get too excited that I don't want to set

02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:12.500
the expectations too high for this game, I'm just going to set the bar, like, somewhere

02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:13.500
in the middle.

02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:16.020
Because, you know, I don't want to get too excited and then be disappointed, you know

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:17.020
what I mean?

02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:18.020
No, I hear you.

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:19.020
I hear you.

02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:21.020
I'd be one of those things, like, you get all gung-ho about it, and it's like, ah, man,

02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:22.820
when the heck did I do this in the first place?

02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:23.820
Exactly.

02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:26.340
All right, well, X-Link, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank

02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:29.320
you so much for the call, and, you know what, actually, when you called, like, about two

02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:32.500
other people called in at the same time, so you lucked out, so congrats.

02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:33.500
No problem.

02:26:33.500 --> 02:26:34.500
Thanks, man.

02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:35.500
I appreciate it.

02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.220
All right, that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight, and I apologize to those

02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:42.780
folks that didn't get through, but if you do want to still interact with the show, remember,

02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:47.900
we do take Twitter topics every week, we do take emails every week, you know what, any

02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:51.460
way you can figure out on the internet on all of our various websites to contact us,

02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:55.980
we will probably consider reading it on the show if you find us on one of those many,

02:26:55.980 --> 02:26:56.980
many websites.

02:26:56.980 --> 02:27:00.100
I'm going to go ahead and let Loki finish up any last minute stories he has while we

02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:01.580
go ahead and shut down the Skypline.

02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:03.620
This is kind of old news, I guess.

02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:06.380
I've never heard of it, so I'm going to mention it.

02:27:06.380 --> 02:27:13.220
Apparently there is a fan project, I guess an independent game, if you will, that is

02:27:13.220 --> 02:27:24.740
called Terrordrome, and basically it's a fighting game featuring only horror movie characters.

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.860
I've not heard of this either, interesting.

02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:36.860
So you've got Freddy, you've got Jason from the Friday the 13th movies, you actually have

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:44.260
Ash in there as well, Chucky, lots of cool characters, oh here's the full list, oh it's

02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:49.260
under construction, thank you, but they do have a demo available online, I guess, that

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:57.860
you can download, it's awesome, and I'll have to check that out.

02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:06.060
But if you want to check it out, it's at Terrordrome-thegame.com.

02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:07.060
That's it.

02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:08.060
Alright.

02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:12.660
I had to link something in the chat room that has nothing to do with video games.

02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:15.780
But you thought you'd link it anyway, it's all good, what is it?

02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:18.580
Come have a look, it's actually this right here.

02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:25.780
I'm a big type nerd, and I like that there's this garage where they actually manage to

02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:30.660
get it, where if you're looking right from a certain angle, everything is perfectly aligned.

02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:33.920
But as you go through, you see they've actually painted it all the way across.

02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:37.020
That is pretty nerdy, I gotta say.

02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.700
It's one of those optical illusions.

02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:43.700
But also, when I look at games, I've actually been paying more attention to how they're

02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:48.540
designed, you know, the look and feel of them, and I think that has a lot to do with that.

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:50.980
You know, you have to know your way around everything.

02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:51.980
Alright.

02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:55.980
Uh, Loki, I still see you playing on the YouTube there, did you get your thing fixed, or what

02:28:55.980 --> 02:28:56.980
did you do?

02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:59.660
Um, I argued saying that it was under fair use.

02:28:59.660 --> 02:29:02.420
Oh, and it, the audio's back!

02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:03.420
Nice.

02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:07.460
Oh, look at that, see, arguing works.

02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:09.260
I hope you don't get our account closed.

02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:10.260
No, yeah.

02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:15.380
So anyways, the new video that I posted online is now working, so if you want to go check

02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:19.780
it out, please do it quickly, because I don't know how long they'll leave it up there.

02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:23.060
And next week, next week we may not have an Orange Lounge Radio YouTube account, so enjoy

02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:24.060
it while it lasts.

02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:25.060
Who gives a crap?

02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:26.060
We'll make a new one.

02:29:26.060 --> 02:29:27.060
Alright.

02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:28.060
But yes, check it out now!

02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:29.060
Cool.

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:32.620
Uh, I have a quick last minute, sort of like, update.

02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:38.940
Every year at Orange Lounge Radio, our friends over at Understation Live do their March Madness,

02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:42.940
but now they call it, I think they just call it, uh, USL Madness, because it doesn't always

02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:47.860
happen in March, but all the, you might remember a few weeks ago, we got some phone calls,

02:29:47.860 --> 02:29:52.460
they were collecting the top 25 games, well they compiled that and they got the first

02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:53.980
brackets up.

02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:57.300
So some of the games are now doing battle, so if you want to check that out, go to Orange

02:29:57.300 --> 02:30:02.100
Lounge Radio, and go to our forums, and you'll see there's a whole forum for March Madness,

02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:05.300
and it says 2009 because we can't figure out how to update it, but it actually is all the

02:30:05.300 --> 02:30:10.380
posts for 2010, and you can see all the brackets, and you can vote in the first round, but voting

02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:12.860
closes tomorrow night, Monday night.

02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:15.700
So you can choose, like, for instance, I'll read a few of these matchups that are going

02:30:15.700 --> 02:30:22.900
on right now, Civilization versus Time Crisis, which is better, uh, Halo 2 versus Para Para

02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:30.640
Paradise, Contra versus Final Fantasy X, and one of my favorites, Final Fantasy versus

02:30:30.640 --> 02:30:34.480
Final Fantasy VIII, that's right, it just so happened the two Final Fantasies are doing

02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:38.380
battle for each other, and when I voted Final Fantasy VIII was winning and I was pissed,

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:42.460
I was like, how can people vote for Craptacular VIII over the original?

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:46.380
I don't get it, but Final Fantasy I is currently winning and I feel much better.

02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:49.100
So there you go, go check that out, but that's only going to be good till Monday night, so

02:30:49.100 --> 02:30:53.940
if you're listening on the podcast, it might be too late, but you can go vote in the next

02:30:53.940 --> 02:31:01.020
round and have your voice heard on what is truly the best video game of all time, according

02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:03.100
to the OLR network.

02:31:03.100 --> 02:31:06.780
Alright, um, that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio, I know we're

02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:10.420
done a little bit early tonight, but, um, that's the way it goes sometimes, sometimes

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:13.180
we have a lot to say, sometimes we don't have as much to say, so we're going to wrap it

02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:15.940
all up and get on out of here for the night.

02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:20.060
But first, we gotta go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start with my final

02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:21.060
thought tonight.

02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:24.420
My final thought is, I should, like, go to the arcade or something, play some arcade

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:25.420
games, that would be fun.

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:26.420
I haven't been in a while.

02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:27.420
That sounds like fun.

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:28.420
It does sound like fun.

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:29.420
Maybe after moving.

02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:30.940
Uh, DarkSakurai, your final thought?

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:32.860
Typography is life.

02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:34.220
And Loki, your final thought?

02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:38.300
It's really funny how- Your mic's off.

02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:43.460
It's really funny how my mic was off, um, no, that, uh, just a simple little, uh, instructional

02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:50.540
guide on eHow can get your YouTube video back up even though it has copyright music in it.

02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:54.340
Let's hope it's there next week, we'll see, but, uh, one thing I hope to see next week

02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:55.340
is all of you.

02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:58.620
Uh, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:02.780
Hey, if you like what you heard, all we ask, tell a couple friends about the show, tell

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:06.000
a couple enemies about the show if you want, just tell people about the show, help us with

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.220
word of mouth because that is the only way we get to promote.

02:32:08.220 --> 02:32:12.060
We don't have a multimillion dollar website or magazine or video game company behind us.

02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:14.260
We are all about the independent word of mouth.

02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:17.460
That's how we've been kept empowered over the past eight years that we've been doing

02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:18.460
this show.

02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:19.460
Whew.

02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:21.260
All right, we'll be back to do it all again next week.

02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:22.820
It is Valentine's Day.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:24.660
Who knows what's going to happen next week.

02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:25.660
So, uh, tune in.

02:32:25.660 --> 02:32:29.460
Until then, uh, that does it for another week here at Orange Lounge Studios.

02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:30.460
Have a great week.

02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:37.460
We'll be back next Sunday for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:01.460
Right anyway.

02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:30.460
See you next week.
